Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), also known as cell division protein kinase 4, is an enzyme that is encoded by the CDK4 gene in humans. CDK4 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, a group of serine/threonine kinases which regulate the cell cycle. CDK4 regulates the G1/S transition by contributing to the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) protein, which leads to the release of protein factors like E2F1 that promote S-phase progression. It is regulated by cyclins like cyclin D proteins, regulatory kinases, and cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs). Dysregulation of the CDK4 pathway is common in many cancers, and CDK4 is a new therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
