In organic chemistry, a glycosyl group is a univalent free radical or substituent structure obtained by removing the hydroxyl (−OH) group from the hemiacetal (−CH(OH)O−) group found in the cyclic form of a monosaccharide and, by extension, of a lower oligosaccharide. Glycosyl groups are exchanged during glycosylation from the glycosyl donor, the electrophile, to the glycosyl acceptor, the nucleophile. The outcome of the glycosylation reaction is largely dependent on the reactivity of each partner. Glycosyl also reacts with inorganic acids, such as phosphoric acid, forming an ester such as glucose 1-phosphate.
