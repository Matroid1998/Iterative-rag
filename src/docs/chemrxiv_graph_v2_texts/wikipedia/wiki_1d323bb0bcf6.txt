Benzylideneacetone is the organic compound described by the formula C6H5CH=CHC(O)CH3.  Although both cis- and trans-isomers are possible for the α,β-unsaturated ketone, only the trans isomer is observed.  Its original preparation demonstrated the scope of condensation reactions to construct new, complex organic compounds. Benzylideneacetone is used as a flavouring ingredient in food and perfumes.
