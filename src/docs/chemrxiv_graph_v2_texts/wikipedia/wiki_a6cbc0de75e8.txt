Phellandrenes are  organic compounds with the formula C10H20. have a similar molecular structure and similar chemical properties. α-Phellandrene and β-phellandrene are cyclic monoterpenes and are double-bond isomers. In α-phellandrene, both double bonds are endocyclic, and in β-phellandrene, one of them is exocyclic. Both are insoluble in water, but miscible with organic solvents.
