Acrylonitrile is an organic compound with the formula CH2CHCN and the structure H2C=CH−C≡N. It is a colorless, volatile liquid. It has a pungent odor of garlic or onions.  Its molecular structure consists of a vinyl group (−CH=CH2) linked to a nitrile (−C≡N).  It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as polyacrylonitrile.  It is reactive and toxic at low doses. 
Acrylonitrile is one of the components of ABS plastic (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).
