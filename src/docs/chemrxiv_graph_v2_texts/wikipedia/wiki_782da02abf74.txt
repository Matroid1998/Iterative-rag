Deuterated chloroform, also known as chloroform-d, is the organic compound with the formula CDCl3. Deuterated chloroform is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. The properties of CDCl3 and ordinary CHCl3 (chloroform) are virtually identical.
Deuterochloroform was first made in 1935 during the years of research on deuterium.
