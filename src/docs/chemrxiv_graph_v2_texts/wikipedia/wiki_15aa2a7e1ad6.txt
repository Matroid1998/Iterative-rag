Phthalates (US:  UK: ), or phthalate esters, are esters of phthalic acid. They are mainly used as plasticizers, i.e., substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, transparency, durability, and longevity. They are used primarily to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC). While phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, not all plasticizers are phthalates. The two terms are specific, unique, and not used interchangeably.
Lower-molecular-weight phthalates are typically replaced in many products in the United States, Canada, and European Union over health concerns. They are being replaced by higher molecular-weight phthalates as well as non-phthalic plasticizers.
Phthalates are commonly ingested in small quantities via the diet. There are numerous forms of phthalates not regulated by governments. One of the most commonly known phtalates is bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). In many countries,  DEHP is regulated as a toxin, and is banned from use in broad categories of consumer goods, such as cosmetics, children's toys, medical devices, and food packaging.
