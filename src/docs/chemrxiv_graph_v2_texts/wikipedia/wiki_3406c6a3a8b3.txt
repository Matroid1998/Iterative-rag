Farnesol is a natural 15-carbon  organic compound which is an acyclic sesquiterpene alcohol. Under standard conditions, it is a colorless liquid. It is hydrophobic, and thus insoluble in water, but miscible with oils.  As the pyrophosphate ester, farnesol is a precursor to many terpenes and terpenoids.
