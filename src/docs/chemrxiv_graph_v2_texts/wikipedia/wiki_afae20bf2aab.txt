In organic chemistry, ozonolysis is an organic reaction where the unsaturated bonds are cleaved with ozone (O3). Multiple carbonâ€“carbon bond are replaced by carbonyl (C=O) groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. The reaction is predominantly applied to alkenes, but alkynes and azo compounds are also susceptible to cleavage. The outcome of the reaction depends on the type of multiple bond being oxidized and the work-up conditions.  
Detailed procedures have been reported.
