Glucuronic acid (GCA, from Ancient Greek: γλεῦκος + οὖρον, lit. 'sweet wine, must + urine') is a uronic acid that was first isolated from urine (hence the name "uronic acid"). It is found in many gums such as gum arabic (approx. 18%), xanthan, and kombucha tea and is important for the metabolism of microorganisms, plants and animals.
