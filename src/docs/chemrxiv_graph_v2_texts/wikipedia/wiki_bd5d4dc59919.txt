Propylthiouracil (PTU) is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. This includes hyperthyroidism due to  Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. In a thyrotoxic crisis it is generally more effective than methimazole. Otherwise it is typically only used when methimazole, surgery, and radioactive iodine is not possible. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include itchiness, hair loss, parotid swelling, vomiting, muscle pains, numbness, and headache. Other severe side effects include liver problems and low blood cell counts. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. Propylthiouracil is in the antithyroid family of medications. It works by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland and blocking the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).
Propylthiouracil came into medical use in the 1940s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
