Tetraphenylporphyrin, abbreviated TPP or H2TPP, is a synthetic heterocyclic compound that resembles naturally occurring porphyrins.  Porphyrins are dyes and cofactors found in hemoglobin and cytochromes and are related to chlorophyll and vitamin B12.  The study of naturally occurring porphyrins is complicated by their low symmetry and the presence of polar substituents.  Tetraphenylporphyrin is hydrophobic, symmetrically substituted, and easily synthesized.  The compound is a dark purple solid that dissolves in nonpolar organic solvents such as chloroform and benzene.
