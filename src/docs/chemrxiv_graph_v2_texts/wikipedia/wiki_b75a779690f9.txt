Tungsten hexacarbonyl (also called tungsten carbonyl) is an organometallic compound with the formula W(CO)6. This complex gave rise to the first example of a dihydrogen complex.
Like its chromium and molybdenum analogs, this colorless compound is noteworthy as a volatile, air-stable derivative of tungsten in its zero oxidation state.
