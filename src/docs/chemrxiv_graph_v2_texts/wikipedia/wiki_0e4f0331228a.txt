Potassium carbonate is the inorganic compound with the formula K2CO3. It is a white salt, which is soluble in water and forms a strongly alkaline solution. It is deliquescent, often appearing as a damp or wet solid. Potassium carbonate is mainly used in the production of soap and glass. Commonly, it can be found as the result of leakage of alkaline batteries. Potassium carbonate is a potassium salt of carbonic acid. This salt consists of potassium cations K+ and carbonate anions CO2âˆ’3, and is therefore an alkali metal carbonate.
