Chalconoids (Greek: χαλκός khalkós, "copper", due to its color), also known as chalcones, are natural phenols derived from chalcone. They form the central core for a variety of important biological compounds.
They show antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties. Some chalconoids demonstrated the ability to block voltage-dependent potassium channels. Chalcones are also natural aromatase inhibitors.
Chalcones are aromatic ketones with two phenyl rings that are also intermediates in the synthesis of many biological compounds. The closure of hydroxy chalcones causes the formation of the flavonoid structure. Flavonoids are substances in the plant's secondary metabolism with an array of biological activities.
Chalconoids are also intermediating in the Auwers synthesis of flavones.
