Indene is an aromatic, polycyclic hydrocarbon with chemical formula C9H8.  It is composed of a benzene ring fused with a cyclopentene ring.  This flammable liquid is colorless although samples often are pale yellow.  The principal industrial use of indene is in the production of indene/coumarone thermoplastic resins. Substituted indenes and their closely related indane derivatives are important structural motifs found in many natural products and biologically active molecules, such as sulindac.
