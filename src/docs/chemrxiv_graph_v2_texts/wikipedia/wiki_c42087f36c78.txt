Mecoprop (also known as methylchlorophenoxypropionic acid and MCPP) is a common general use herbicide found in many household weed killers and "weed-and-feed" type lawn fertilizers. It is primarily used to control broadleaf weeds. It is often used in combination with other chemically related herbicides such as 2,4-D, dicamba, and MCPA, which mimic the plant hormone IAA (auxin) and kill most broadleaf weeds by causing uncontrolled growth. 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified mecoprop as toxicity class III - slightly toxic.
Mecoprop is a mixture of two stereoisomers, with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer ("Mecoprop-P", "Duplosan KV") possessing the herbicidal activity.
