Bipyridines  are a family of organic compounds with the formula (C5H4N)2, consisting of two pyridyl (C5H4N) rings. Pyridine is an aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The bipyridines are all colourless solids, which are soluble in organic solvents and slightly soluble in water. Bipyridines, especially the 4,4' isomer, are mainly of significance in pesticides. 

Six isomers of bipyridine exist, but two are prominent. 2,2â€²-bipyridine, also known as bipyridyl, dipyridyl, and dipyridine, is a popular ligand in coordination chemistry
