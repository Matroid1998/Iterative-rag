Fluoropyrimidines are a general class organic compounds in which the substituent(s) around a pyrimidine ring include at least one fluorine atom.  The term "fluoropyrimidines" is often used more specifically to refer to the subset of this class that are antimetabolites and are used as anticancer medications, which include:

Capecitabine
Carmofur (HCFU)
Doxifluridine
Fluorouracil (5-FU)
Tegafur
Some metabolites of these drugs, such as 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate monophosphate, also have fluoropyrimidine structures in the general sense of the term, but the more specific meaning is typically reserved for substances used as pharmaceuticals.
