Silver iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula AgI.  The compound is a bright yellow solid, but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a grey colouration.  The silver contamination arises because some samples of AgI can be highly photosensitive.  This property is exploited in silver-based photography.  Silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding.
