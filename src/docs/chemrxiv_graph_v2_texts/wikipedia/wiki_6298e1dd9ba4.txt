Naphtha (, recorded as less common or nonstandard in all dictionaries: ) is a flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Generally, it is a fraction of crude oil, but it can also be produced from natural-gas condensates, petroleum distillates, and the fractional distillation of coal tar and peat.  In some industries and regions, the name naphtha refers to crude oil or refined petroleum products such as kerosene or diesel fuel.
Naphtha is also known as Shellite in Australia.
