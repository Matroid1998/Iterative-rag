In organic chemistry, free-radical addition is an addition reaction which involves free radicals.  These reactions can happen due to the free radicals having an unpaired electron in their valence shell, making them highly reactive.  Radical additions are known for a variety of unsaturated substrates, both olefinic or aromatic and with or without heteroatoms.
Free-radical reactions depend on one or more relatively weak bonds in a reagent.  Under reaction conditions (typically heat or light), some weak bonds homolyse into radicals, which then induce further decomposition in their compatriots before recombination.  Different mechanisms typically apply to reagents without such a weak bond.
