Mesolite is a tectosilicate mineral with formula Na2Ca2Si9Al6O30·8H2O. It is a member of the zeolite group and the natrolite subgroup, also resembling natrolite in appearance.
Mesolite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and typically forms fibrous, acicular prismatic crystals or masses. Radiating sprays of needlelike crystals are not uncommon. It is vitreous in luster and clear to white in color. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 5.5 and a low specific gravity of 2.2 to 2.4. The refractive indices are nα=1.505 nβ=1.505 nγ=1.506.
