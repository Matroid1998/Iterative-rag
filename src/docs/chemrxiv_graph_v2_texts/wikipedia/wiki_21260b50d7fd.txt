A polyhalogenated compound (PHC) is any compound with multiple substitutions of halogens.  They are of particular interest and importance because they bioaccumulate in humans, and comprise a superset of which has many toxic and carcinogenic industrial chemicals as members.  PBDEs, PCBs, dioxins (PCDDs) and PFCs are all polyhalogenated compounds.  They are generally non-miscible in organic solvents or water, but miscible in some hydrocarbons from which they often derive.
