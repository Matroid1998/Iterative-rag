In Greek mythology, Pheme ( FEE-mee; Greek: Φήμη, Phēmē; Roman equivalent: Fama), also known as Ossa in Homeric sources, was the personification of fame and renown, her favour being notability, her wrath being scandalous rumours. She was a daughter either of Gaia or of Elpis (Hope), was described as "she who initiates and furthers communication" and had an altar at Athens. A tremendous gossip, Pheme was said to have pried into the affairs of mortals and gods, then repeated what she learned, starting off at first with just a dull whisper, but repeating it louder each time, until everyone knew. In art, she was usually depicted with wings and a trumpet.
In Roman mythology, Fama ("rumour") was described as having multiple tongues, eyes, ears, and feathers by Virgil (in Aeneid IV line 180 and following) and other authors. Virgil wrote that she "had her feet on the ground, and her head in the clouds, making the small seem great and the great seem greater". 
In Homer Pheme is called the Rumour goddess or the messenger of Zeus. In Book One of the Odyssey, the purpose of Telemachus' journey to Pylos is so that he might gain "pheme" among the world. 
In English Renaissance theatre, Rumour was a stock personification, best known from William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 in the quote "Open your ears; for which of you will stop The vent of hearing, when loud Rumour speaks?".  James C. Bulman's Arden Shakespeare edition notes numerous lesser known theatrical examples.
