Buckminsterfullerene is a type of fullerene with the formula C60. It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, and resembles a soccer ball. Each of its 60 carbon atoms is bonded to its three neighbors. 
Buckminsterfullerene is a black solid that dissolves in hydrocarbon solvents to produce a violet solution.  The substance was discovered in 1985 and has received intense study, although few real world applications have been found.
Molecules of buckminsterfullerene (or of fullerenes in general) are commonly nicknamed buckyballs.
