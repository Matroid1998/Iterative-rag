In organic chemistry, an acetonide is the functional group composed of the cyclic ketal of a diol with acetone. The more systematic name for this structure is an isopropylidene ketal. Acetonide is a common protecting group for 1,2- and 1,3-diols. The protecting group can be removed by hydrolysis of the ketal using dilute aqueous acid.
