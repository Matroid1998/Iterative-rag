In organic chemistry, helicenes are ortho-condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds in which benzene rings or other aromatics are angularly annulated to give helically-shaped chiral molecules. The chemistry of helicenes has attracted continuing attention because of their unique structural, spectral, and optical features.
