Quadricyclane is a strained, multi-cyclic hydrocarbon with the formula CH2(CH)6.  A white volatile colorless liquid, it is highly strained molecule (78.7 kcal/mol). Isomerization of quadricyclane proceeds slowly at low temperatures. Because of quadricyclane's strained structure and thermal stability, it has been studied extensively.
