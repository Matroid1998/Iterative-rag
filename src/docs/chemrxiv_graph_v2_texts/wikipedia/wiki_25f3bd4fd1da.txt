Diiron nonacarbonyl is an organometallic compound with the formula Fe2(CO)9.  This metal carbonyl is a reagent in organometallic chemistry and of occasional use in organic synthesis.  It is a more reactive source of Fe(0) than Fe(CO)5.  This micaceous orange solid is virtually insoluble in all common solvents.
