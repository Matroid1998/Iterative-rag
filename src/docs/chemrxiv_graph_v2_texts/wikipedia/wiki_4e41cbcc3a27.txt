The enzyme MHETase is a hydrolase, which was discovered in 2016. It cleaves 2-hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid, the PET degradation product by PETase, to ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. This pair of enzymes, PETase and MHETase, enable the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis to live on the plastic PET as sole carbon source.
