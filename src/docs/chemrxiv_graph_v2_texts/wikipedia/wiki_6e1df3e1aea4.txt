Succinonitrile, also butanedinitrile, is a nitrile, with the formula of C2H4(CN)2. It is a colorless waxy solid which melts at 58 °C.
Succinonitrile is produced by the addition of hydrogen cyanide to acrylonitrile (hydrocyanation):

CH2=CHCN  +  HCN  →  NCCH2CH2CN
Hydrogenation of succinonitrile yields putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane).
