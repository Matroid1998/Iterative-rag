Lithium titanates are chemical compounds of lithium, titanium and oxygen. They are mixed oxides and belong to the titanates. The most important lithium titanates are:

lithium titanate spinel, Li4Ti5O12 and the related compounds up to Li7Ti5O12. These titanates are used in lithium-titanate batteries.
lithium metatitanate, a compound with the chemical formula Li2TiO3 and a melting point of 1,533 °C (2,791 °F) It is a white powder with possible applications in tritium breeding materials in nuclear fusion applications.
Other lithium titanates, i.e. mixed oxides of the system Li2O–TiO2, are:

Lithium orthotitanate Li4TiO4, melting point of 1,200 °C (2,190 °F)
Ramsdellite lithium titanate Li2Ti3O7 and LixTiO2 (0 ≦ x ≦ 0.57)  with ramsdellite structure.
