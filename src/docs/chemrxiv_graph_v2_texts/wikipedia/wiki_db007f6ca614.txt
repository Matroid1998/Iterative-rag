Stilbenoids are hydroxylated derivatives of stilbene. They have a C6–C2–C6 structure. In biochemical terms, they belong to the family of phenylpropanoids and share most of their biosynthesis pathway with chalcones. Most stilbenoids are produced by plants, and the only known exception is the antimicrobial stilbenoid drug tapinarof which is biosynthesized by the Gram-negative bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.
