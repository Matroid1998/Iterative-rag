The Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, also known as the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and abbreviated as MC6, was held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, Wan Chai, Hong Kong from 13 to 18 December 2005. Representatives from 148 countries were expected to attend the event, as well as over 10,000 protesters led by the Hong Kong Peopleâ€™s Alliance on WTO and made up of largely South Korean farmers. The conference approved a declaration which many participants described as marking "significant progress". However, due to violent protesters, police officers were deployed with batons, riot gas, and other non-lethal weapons. Around 910 people were arrested. Of these, 14 were charged, but none were convicted.
