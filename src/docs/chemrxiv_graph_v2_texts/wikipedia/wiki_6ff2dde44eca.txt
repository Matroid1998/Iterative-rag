In organic chemistry, an aromatic amine is an organic compound consisting of an aromatic ring attached to an amine.  It is a broad class of compounds that encompasses anilines, but also many more complex aromatic rings and many amine substituents beyond NH2.  Such compounds occur widely.

Aromatic amines are widely used as precursor to pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes.
