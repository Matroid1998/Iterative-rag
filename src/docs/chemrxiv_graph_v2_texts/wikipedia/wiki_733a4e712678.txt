Cilnidipine is a calcium channel blocker. Cilnidipine is approved for use in Japan, China, India, Nepal, and Korea for hypertension. 
It is a calcium antagonist accompanied with L-type and N-type calcium channel blocking functions. Unlike other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the N-type calcium channel in addition to acting on the L-type calcium channel.
It was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1995. Cilnidipine is currently being repurposed and developed for use in patients with Raynaud's Phenomenon and Systemic Sclerosis by Aisa Pharma, a US biopharma development company.
