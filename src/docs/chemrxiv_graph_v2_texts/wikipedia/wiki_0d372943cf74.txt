Synthetic fuel or synfuel is a liquid fuel, or sometimes gaseous fuel, obtained from syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in which the syngas was derived from gasification of solid feedstocks such as coal or biomass or by reforming of natural gas.
Common ways for refining synthetic fuels include the Fischerâ€“Tropsch conversion, methanol to gasoline conversion, or direct coal liquefaction.
