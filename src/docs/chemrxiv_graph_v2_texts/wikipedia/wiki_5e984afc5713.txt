In organic chemistry, an imine ( or ) is a functional group or organic compound containing a carbon–nitrogen double bond (C=N). The nitrogen atom can be attached to a hydrogen  or an organic group (R). The carbon atom has two additional single bonds.  Imines are common in synthetic and naturally occurring compounds and they participate in many reactions.
Distinction is sometimes made between aldimines and ketimines, derived from aldehydes and ketones, respectively.
