Diiodomethane or methylene iodide, commonly abbreviated "MI", is an organoiodine compound. Diiodomethane is a very dense colorless liquid; however, it decomposes upon exposure to light liberating iodine, which colours samples brownish.  It is slightly soluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents. It has a very high refractive index of 1.741, and a surface tension of 0.0508 N·m−1.
