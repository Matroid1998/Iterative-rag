Bedaquiline, sold under the brand name Sirturo, is a medication used for the treatment of active tuberculosis. Specifically, it is used to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis along with other medications for tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include nausea, joint pains, headaches, and chest pain. Serious side effects include QT prolongation, liver dysfunction, and an increased risk of death. While harm during pregnancy has not been found, it has not been well studied in this population. It is in the diarylquinoline antimycobacterial class of medications. It works by blocking the ability of M. tuberculosis to make adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP).
Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
