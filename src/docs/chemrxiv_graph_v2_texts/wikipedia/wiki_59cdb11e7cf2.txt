Vapor etching refers to a process used in the fabrication of Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Sacrificial layers are isotropically etched using gaseous acids such as Hydrogen fluoride and Xenon difluoride to release the free standing components of the device.
Economic advantages and novel technological possibilities result from micron to nano scale size reductions. (MEMS to NEMS) The small dimensions make the use of  isotropic wet etch processes traditionally used in micro fabrication suffer from stiction, the permanent adherence of the free standing structure to the underlying substrate due to the scaling of surface effects occurring during the drying of the acid.  Vapor etching overcomes stiction because no liquids are used during the etch process. Commonly, hydrogen fluoride and xenon difluorides are  used to etch silicon dioxide and silicon sacrificial layers respectively.
