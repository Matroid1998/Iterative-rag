Pedot is the eleventh album of the Finnish rock band CMX. "Pedot" means "Beasts" in Finnish.
The opening track "Eteläisen tähtitaivaan kartoitus" breaks a CMX tradition of starting their albums with powerful rock songs. It is a minimalistic piano-based ballad with no drums. The title track is heavy, progressive and one of the very few tracks where Tuomas Peippo makes use of double bass pedals. "Uusi ihmiskunta" was the first single from the album (the second was "Kain"), and reached #1 on the Finnish singles chart.
