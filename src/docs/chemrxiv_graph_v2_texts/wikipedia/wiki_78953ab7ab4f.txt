Perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) are a class of organofluorine compound. Some types are synthetic liquid lubricants that have been used in the aerospace industry for over 30 years. The main properties of PFPE are being temperature resistant between −58 °C (215 K) and 257 °C (530 K) (depending on specific composites), having very low outgassing compared to other fluids (vapour pressure of 6×10−8 Torr) and having a dielectric strength of around 15.7 MV/m.
Perfluoropolyethers consists of a polymer chain in which monomers consisting of perfluoro-alkyl groups are joined by ether linkages. The bonds between carbon and oxygen or fluorine are strong. Perfluoropolyethers are a type of PFAS.
The thermal and chemical stability of PFPEs along with a vapor–liquid equilibrium of 230 °C when mixed with the right composites make it a suitable candidate for vapor phase soldering technologies.
