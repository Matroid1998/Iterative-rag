Sulfuryl chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula SO2Cl2.  At room temperature, it is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor.  Sulfuryl chloride is not found in nature, as can be inferred from its rapid hydrolysis.
Sulfuryl chloride is commonly confused with thionyl chloride, SOCl2.  The properties of these two sulfur oxychlorides are quite different: sulfuryl chloride is a source of chlorine whereas thionyl chloride is a source of chloride ions. An alternative IUPAC name is sulfuryl dichloride.
Sulfur is tetrahedral in SO2Cl2 and the oxidation state of the sulfur atom is +6, as in sulfuric acid.
