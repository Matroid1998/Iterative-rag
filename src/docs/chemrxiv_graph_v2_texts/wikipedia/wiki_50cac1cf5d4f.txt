Cobaltocene, known also as bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt(II) or even "bis Cp cobalt", is an organocobalt compound with the formula Co(C5H5)2. It is a dark purple solid that sublimes readily slightly above room temperature.  Cobaltocene was discovered shortly after ferrocene, the first metallocene.  Due to the ease with which it reacts with oxygen, the compound must be handled and stored using air-free techniques.
