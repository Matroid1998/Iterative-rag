Biferrocene is the organometallic compound with the formula [(C5H5)Fe(C5H4)]2.  It is the product of the formal dehydrocoupling of ferrocene, analogous the relationship between biphenyl and benzene. It is an orange, air-stable solid that is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.
Biferrocene can be prepared by the Ullmann coupling of iodoferrocene.  Its one-electron oxidized derivative [(C5H5)Fe(C5H4)]2+ attracted attention as a prototypical mixed-valence compound.
A related compound is biferrocenylene, [Fe(C5H4)2]2 wherein all cyclopentadienyl rings are coupled.  Formally, biferrocene is derived from one fulvalene ligand, and biferrocenylene is derived from two.
