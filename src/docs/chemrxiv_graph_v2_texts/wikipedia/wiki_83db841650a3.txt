A performance is an act or process of staging or presenting a play, concert, or other form of entertainment. It is also defined as the action or process of carrying out or accomplishing an action, task, or function. 
Performance has evolved globally, from ancient rituals to modern artistic expressions. Expanding the article with historical and cultural perspectives would improve its scope.
Ancient & Classical Theater: Rooted in rituals (Egyptian passion plays, Indigenous storytelling), early performances led to Greek tragedy, Sanskrit drama, and Chinese opera.
Medieval & Early Modern Performance: Includes mystery plays in Europe, Commedia dellâ€™arte in Italy, and Kabuki & Noh in Japan.
Contemporary & Political Performance: Modern forms include agitprop theater, Forum Theater, and performance art as activism.
By highlighting global traditions, the article would better reflect performance as a universal human expression shaped by history and culture.
