2-Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) is an organic compound used in organic synthesis as an oxidizing agent. This periodinane is especially suited to oxidize alcohols to aldehydes. IBX is most often prepared from 2-iodobenzoic acid and a strong oxidant such as potassium bromate and sulfuric acid, or more commonly, oxone. One of the main drawbacks of IBX is its limited solubility; IBX is insoluble in many common organic solvents. IBX is an impact- and heat-sensitive explosive (>200Â°C). Commercial IBX is stabilized by carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and isophthalic acid.
