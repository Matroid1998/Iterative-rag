Fluorocarbons are chemical compounds with carbon-fluorine bonds.  Compounds that contain many C-F bonds often have distinctive properties, e.g., enhanced stability, volatility, and hydrophobicity.  Several fluorocarbons and their derivatives are commercial polymers, refrigerants, drugs, and anesthetics.
