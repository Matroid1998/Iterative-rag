Trimethylenemethane (often abbreviated TMM) is a chemical compound with formula C4H6.  It is a neutral free molecule with two unsatisfied valence bonds, and is therefore a highly reactive free radical.  Formally, it can be viewed as an isobutylene molecule C4H8 with two hydrogen atoms removed from the terminal methyl groups.
