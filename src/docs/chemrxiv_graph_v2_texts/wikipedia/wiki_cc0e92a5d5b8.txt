4H-1-Benzopyran is an organic compound with the formula C6H4C3H4O. It is one of two isomers of benzopyran, the other being 2H-1-benzopyran, which is more prevalent. It can be viewed as the fusion of a benzene ring to a heterocyclic pyran ring.
Some benzopyrans have shown anticancerous activity in vitro.
The radical form of benzopyran is paramagnetic. The unpaired electron is delocalized over the whole benzopyran molecule, rendering it less reactive than one would expect otherwise. A similar example is the cyclopentadienyl radical. Commonly, benzopyran is encountered in the reduced state, in which it is partially saturated with one hydrogen atom, introducing a tetrahedral CH2 group in the pyran ring. Therefore, there are many structural isomers owing to the multiple possible positions of the oxygen atom and the tetrahedral carbon atom:
