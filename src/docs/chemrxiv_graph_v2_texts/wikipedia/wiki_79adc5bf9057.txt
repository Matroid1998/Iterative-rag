The BR postcode area, also known as the Bromley postcode area, is a group of eight postcode districts in England, within seven post towns. These cover part of south-eastern Greater London, as well as a small part of north-west Kent.
The area covers much of the London Borough of Bromley, as well as small parts of the London Borough of Lewisham, the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Croydon. Most of BR8 and a small part of BR6 cover the northwestern part of the Sevenoaks District of Kent, while BR8 also covers the hamlet of Clement Street in the borough of Dartford.
Mail for the area was sorted in Bromley until 1988 when the site was converted to a delivery office only.
