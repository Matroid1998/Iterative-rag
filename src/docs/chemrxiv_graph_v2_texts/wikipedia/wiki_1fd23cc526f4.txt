Lipoic acid (LA), also known as Î±-lipoic acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from caprylic acid (octanoic acid). ALA, which is made in animals normally, is essential for aerobic metabolism. It is also available as a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical drug in some countries. Lipoate is the conjugate base of lipoic acid, and the most prevalent form of LA under physiological conditions. Only the (R)-(+)-enantiomer (RLA) exists in nature. RLA is an essential cofactor of many processes.
