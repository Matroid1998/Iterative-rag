A current collector (often called a "pickup") is a device used in trolleybuses, trams, electric locomotives and EMUs to carry electric power (current) from overhead lines, electric third rails, or ground-level power supplies to the electrical equipment of the vehicles. Those for overhead wires are roof-mounted devices, those for rails are mounted on the bogies.
Typically, electric current connectors have one or more spring-loaded arms that press a collector or contact shoe against the rail or overhead wire.  As the vehicle moves, the contact shoe slides along the wire or rail to draw the electricity needed to run the vehicle's motor.
The current collector arms are electrically conductive but mounted insulated on the vehicle's roof, side or base.  An insulated cable connects the collector with the switch, transformer or motor. The steel rails of the tracks act as the electrical return.
