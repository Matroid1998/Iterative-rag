The sigma-1 receptor (σ1R), one of two sigma receptor subtypes, is a chaperone protein  at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that modulates calcium signaling through the IP3 receptor.  In humans, the σ1 receptor is encoded by the SIGMAR1 gene.
The σ1 receptor is a transmembrane protein expressed in many different tissue types. It is particularly concentrated in certain regions of the central nervous system. It has been implicated in several phenomena, including cardiovascular function, schizophrenia, clinical depression, the effects of cocaine abuse, bipolar disorder, and cancer. Much is known about the binding affinity of hundreds of synthetic compounds to the σ1 receptor.
An endogenous ligand for the σ1 receptor has yet to be conclusively identified, but tryptaminergic trace amines and neuroactive steroids have been found to activate the receptor. Especially progesterone, but also testosterone, pregnenolone sulfate, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) bind to the σ1 receptor.
