The terpinenes are a group of isomeric hydrocarbons that are classified as monoterpenes.  They each have the same molecular formula and carbon framework, but they differ in the position of carbon-carbon double bonds.  α-Terpinene has been isolated from cardamom and marjoram oils, and from other natural sources.  β-Terpinene has no known natural source but has been prepared from sabinene.  γ-Terpinene and δ-terpinene (also known as terpinolene) have been isolated from a variety of plant sources.  They are all colorless liquids with a turpentine-like odor.
