A thioamide (rarely, thionamide, but also known as thiourylenes) is a functional group with the general structure R1−C(=S)−NR2R3, where R1, R2 and R3 are any groups (typically organyl groups or hydrogen). Analogous to amides, thioamides exhibit greater multiple bond character along the C-N bond, resulting in a larger rotational barrier.
