DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), also known as triethylenediamine or TEDA, is a bicyclic organic compound with the formula N2(C2H4)3. This colorless solid is a highly nucleophilic tertiary amine base, which is used as a catalyst and reagent in polymerization and organic synthesis.
It is similar in structure to quinuclidine, but the latter has one of the nitrogen atoms replaced by a carbon atom. Regarding their structures, both DABCO and quinuclidine are unusual in that the methylene hydrogen atoms are eclipsed within each of the three ethylene linkages. Furthermore, the diazacyclohexane rings, of which there are three, adopt the boat conformations, not the usual chair conformations.
