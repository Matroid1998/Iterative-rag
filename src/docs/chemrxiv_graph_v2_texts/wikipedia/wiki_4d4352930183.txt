Chorismic acid, more commonly known as its anionic form chorismate, is an important biochemical intermediate in plants and microorganisms. It is a precursor for:

The aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine
Indole, indole derivatives and tryptophan
2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) used for enterobactin biosynthesis
The plant hormone salicylic acid
Many alkaloids and other aromatic metabolites.
The folate precursor para-aminobenzoate (pABA)
The biosynthesis of vitamin K and folate in plants and microorganisms.
The name chorismic acid derives from a classical Greek word χωρίζω meaning "to separate", because the compound plays a role as a branch-point in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis.
