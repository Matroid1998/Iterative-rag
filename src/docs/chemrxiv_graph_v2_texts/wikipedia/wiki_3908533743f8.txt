Retinoic acid (simplified nomenclature for all-trans-retinoic acid) is a metabolite of vitamin A1 (all-trans-retinol) that is required for embryonic development, male fertility, regulation of bone growth and immune function.  All-trans-retinoic acid is required for chordate animal development, which includes all higher animals from fish to humans. During early embryonic development, all-trans-retinoic acid generated in a specific region of the embryo helps determine position along the embryonic anterior/posterior axis by serving as an intercellular signaling molecule that guides development of the posterior portion of the embryo. It acts through Hox genes, which ultimately control anterior/posterior patterning in early developmental stages. In adult tissues, the activity of endogenous retinoic acid appears limited to immune function and male fertility. 
All-trans-retinoic acid is the major occurring retinoic acid, while isomers like 13-cis- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are also present in much lower levels.
The key role of all-trans-retinoic acid in embryonic development mediates the high teratogenicity of retinoid pharmaceuticals, such as isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) used for treatment of acne or retinol used for skin disorders. High oral doses of preformed vitamin A (retinyl palmitate), and all-trans-retinoic acid itself, also have teratogenic potential by this same mechanism.
