Hydrogen (1H) has three naturally occurring isotopes: 1H, 2H, and 3H. 1H and 2H are stable, while 3H has a half-life of 12.32(2) years. Heavier isotopes also exist; all are synthetic and have a half-life of less than 1 zeptosecond (10âˆ’21 s).
Of these, 5H is the least stable, while 7H is the most.
Hydrogen is the only element whose isotopes have different names that remain in common use today: 2H is deuterium and 3H is tritium. The symbols D and T are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium; IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) accepts said symbols, but recommends the standard isotopic symbols 2H and 3H, to avoid confusion in alphabetic sorting of chemical formulas. 1H, with no neutrons, may be called protium to disambiguate. (During the early study of radioactivity, some other heavy radioisotopes were given names, but such names are rarely used today.)
