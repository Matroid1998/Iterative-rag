Nylon is a family of synthetic polymers characterized by amide linkages, typically connecting aliphatic or semi-aromatic groups.
Nylons are generally white or colorless and possess a soft texture, with some varieties exhibiting a silk-like appearance. As thermoplastics, nylons can be melt-processed into fibers, films, and diverse shapes.: 2  The properties of nylons are often modified by blending with a variety of additives.
Numerous types of nylon are available. One family, designated nylon-XY, is derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids of carbon chain lengths X and Y, respectively. An important example is nylon-6,6 ((−C(O)(CH2)4C(O)−NH(CH2)6NH−)n). Another family, designated nylon-Z, is derived from aminocarboxylic acids with carbon chain length Z. An example is nylon-[6].
Nylon polymers have extensive commercial applications, including uses in textiles and fibers (such as apparel, flooring and rubber reinforcement), molded components for automotive and electrical equipment, and films (mostly for food packaging).
