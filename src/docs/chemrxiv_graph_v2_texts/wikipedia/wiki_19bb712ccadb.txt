Vinylene carbonate (VC) or 1,3-dioxol-2-one, is the simplest unsaturated cyclic carbonic acid ester. Vinylene carbonate can also be thought of as the cyclic carbonate of the hypothetical (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol. The activated double bond in this five-membered oxygen-containing heterocycle makes the molecule a reactive monomer for homopolymerization and copolymerization and a dienophile in Diels-Alder reactions. Below room temperature vinylene carbonate is a colorless stable solid.
