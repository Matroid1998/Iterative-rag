Copper(I) iodide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula CuI. It is also known as cuprous iodide. It is useful in a variety of applications ranging from organic synthesis to cloud seeding.
Copper(I) iodide is white, but samples often appear tan or, when found in nature as rare mineral marshite, reddish brown, but such color is due to the presence of impurities. It is common for samples of iodide-containing compounds to become discolored due to the facile aerobic oxidation of the iodide anion to molecular iodine.
