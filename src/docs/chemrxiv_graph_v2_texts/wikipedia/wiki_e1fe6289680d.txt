Forskolin (coleonol) is a labdane diterpene produced by the plant Coleus barbatus (blue spur flower). Other names include pashanabhedi, Indian coleus, makandi, HL-362, mao hou qiao rui hua. As with other members of the large diterpene class of plant metabolites, forskolin is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Forskolin contains some unique functional elements, including the presence of a tetrahydropyran-derived heterocyclic ring. 
Forskolin is commonly used in laboratory research to increase levels of cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylate cyclase.
