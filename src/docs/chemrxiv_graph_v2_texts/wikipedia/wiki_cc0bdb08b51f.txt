Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin and sold under the brand name Rapamune among others, is a macrolide compound that is used to coat coronary stents, prevent organ transplant rejection, treat a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). It has immunosuppressant functions in humans and is especially useful in preventing the rejection of kidney transplants. It is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor that reduces the sensitivity of T cells and B cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2), inhibiting their activity.
This compound also has a use in cardiovascular drug-eluting stent technologies to inhibit restenosis.
It is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and was isolated for the first time in 1972, from samples of Streptomyces hygroscopicus found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. Sirolimus was initially developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. Hyftor (sirolimus gel) was approved for topical treatment of facial angiofibroma in the European Union in May 2023.
