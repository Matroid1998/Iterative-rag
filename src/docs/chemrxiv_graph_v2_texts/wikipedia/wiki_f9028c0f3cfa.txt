Coercivity, also called the magnetic coercivity, coercive field or coercive force, is a measure of the ability of a ferromagnetic material to withstand an external magnetic field without becoming demagnetized. Coercivity is usually measured in oersted or ampere/meter units and is denoted HC.
An analogous property in electrical engineering and materials science, electric coercivity, is the ability of a ferroelectric material to withstand an external electric field without becoming depolarized.
Ferromagnetic materials with high coercivity are called magnetically hard, and are used to make permanent magnets.  Materials with low coercivity are said to be magnetically soft.  The latter are used in  transformer and inductor cores, recording heads, microwave devices, and magnetic shielding.
