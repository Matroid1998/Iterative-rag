HATU (Hexafluorophosphate Azabenzotriazole Tetramethyl Uronium) is a reagent used in peptide coupling chemistry to generate an active ester from a carboxylic acid. HATU is used along with HÃ¼nig's base (N,N-diisopropylethylamine), or triethylamine to form amide bonds. Typically DMF is used as solvent, although other polar aprotic solvents can also be used.
