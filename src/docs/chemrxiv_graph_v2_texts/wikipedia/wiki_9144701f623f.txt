Nickel(II) oxide is the chemical compound with the formula NiO. It is the principal oxide of nickel. It is classified as a basic metal oxide. Several million kilograms are produced annually of varying quality, mainly as an intermediate in the production of nickel alloys.  The mineralogical form of NiO, bunsenite, is very rare.  Other nickel(III) oxides have been claimed, for example: Ni2O3 and NiO2, but remain unproven.
