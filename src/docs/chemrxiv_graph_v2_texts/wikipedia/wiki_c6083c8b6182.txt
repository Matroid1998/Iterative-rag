Cytochrome P450 reductase (also known as NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:hemoprotein oxidoreductase, NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase, P450 reductase, POR, CPR, CYPOR)  is a membrane-bound enzyme required for electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P450 and other heme proteins including heme oxygenase in the endoplasmic reticulum of the eukaryotic cell.
