Hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52, β-acetylaminodeoxyhexosidase, N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase, N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase, N-acetyl hexosaminidase, β-hexosaminidase, β-acetylhexosaminidinase, β-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, hexosaminidase A, N-acetylhexosaminidase, β-D-hexosaminidase) is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of terminal N-acetyl-D-hexosamine residues in N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminides.
Elevated levels of hexosaminidase in blood and/or urine have been proposed as a biomarker of relapse in the treatment of alcoholism.
Hereditary inability to form functional hexosaminidase enzymes are the cause of lipid storage disorders Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease.
