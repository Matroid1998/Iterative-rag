A hexafluoride is a chemical compound with the general formula QXnF6, QXnF6mâˆ’, or QXnF6m+.  Many molecules fit this formula.  An important hexafluoride is hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6), which is a byproduct of the mining of phosphate rock.  In the nuclear industry, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is an important intermediate in the purification of this element.
