Pinacol is a branched alcohol which finds use in organic syntheses. It is a diol that has hydroxyl groups on vicinal carbon atoms. A white solid that melts just above room temperature, pinacol is notable for undergoing the pinacol rearrangement in the presence of acid and for being the namesake of the pinacol coupling reaction.
