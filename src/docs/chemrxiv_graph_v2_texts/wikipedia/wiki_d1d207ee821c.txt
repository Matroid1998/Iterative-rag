Thionyl fluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula SOF2. This colourless gas is mainly of theoretical interest, but it is a product of the degradation of sulfur hexafluoride, an insulator in electrical equipment.  The molecule adopts a distorted pyramidal structure, with Cs symmetry. The S-O and S-F distances are 1.42 and 1.58 Å, respectively. The O-S-F and F-S-F angles are 106.2 and 92.2°, respectively.
