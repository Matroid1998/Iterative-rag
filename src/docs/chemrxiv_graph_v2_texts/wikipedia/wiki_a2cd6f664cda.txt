Thiourea () is an organosulfur compound with the formula SC(NH2)2 and the structure H2N−C(=S)−NH2. It is structurally similar to urea (H2N−C(=O)−NH2), with the oxygen atom replaced by sulfur atom (as implied by the thio- prefix). The properties of urea and thiourea differ significantly. Thiourea is a reagent in organic synthesis. Thioureas are a broad class of compounds with the formula SC(NHR)(NH2), SC(NHR)2, etc
