Polymyxins are antibiotics. Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections.  They work mostly by breaking up the bacterial cell membrane.  They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides.
They are produced in nature by Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa.
