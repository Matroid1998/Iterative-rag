Triphenylamine is an organic compound with formula (C6H5)3N. In contrast to most amines, triphenylamine is nonbasic. At room temperature it appears as a colorless crystalline solid, with monoclinic structure. It is well miscible in diethyl ether and benzene, but it is practically insoluble in water, and partially in ethanol. Its derivatives have useful properties in electrical conductivity and electroluminescence, and they are used in OLEDs as hole-transporters.
Triphenylamine can be prepared by arylation of diphenylamine.
