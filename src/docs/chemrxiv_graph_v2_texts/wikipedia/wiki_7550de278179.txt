Hydrophosphination is the insertion of a double bond into a phosphorus-hydrogen bond.  Often the hydrophosphination makes phosphorus-carbon bonds by addition of P-H bonds to carbon-carbon multiple bonds, but the reaction is probably most useful in reactions of phosphine with formaldehyde, a form of hydroxymethylation.
Like other hydrofunctionalizations, the rate and regiochemistry of the insertion reaction is influenced by the catalyst.  Catalysts take many forms, but most prevalent are bases and free-radical initiators.  Most hydrophosphinations involve reactions of phosphine (PH3).
