Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in various ratios.  The gas often contains some carbon dioxide and methane.   It is principally used for producing ammonia or methanol. Syngas is combustible and can be used as a fuel. Historically, it has been used as a replacement for gasoline, when gasoline supply has been limited; for example, wood gas was used to power cars in Europe during WWII (in Germany alone, half a million cars were built or rebuilt to run on wood gas).
