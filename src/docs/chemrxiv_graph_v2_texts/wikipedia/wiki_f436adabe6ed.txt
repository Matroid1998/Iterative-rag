The isoprostanes are  prostaglandin-like compounds formed in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation
of essential fatty acids (primarily arachidonic acid) without the direct action of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.  The compounds were discovered in 1990 by L. Jackson Roberts and Jason D. Morrow in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University.  

These nonclassical eicosanoids possess potent biological activity as inflammatory mediators that augment the perception of pain. These compounds are accurate markers of lipid peroxidation in both animal and human models of oxidative stress.
Elevated levels of isoprostanes are suspected of contributing to increased risk of heart attack in patients taking Coxibs.   Isoprostanes and their metabolites have also been shown to be elevated in the urine of cigarette smokers, and have been suggested as biomarkers of oxidative stress in smokers.
