Perfluorooctane, also known as octadecafluorooctane, is a fluorocarbon liquidâ€”a perfluorinated derivative of the hydrocarbon octane. It can be a good substitute for insulating oil in high voltage electronics. In addition to heat transfer applications, it has also been used as a breathable fluid in partial liquid ventilation.
