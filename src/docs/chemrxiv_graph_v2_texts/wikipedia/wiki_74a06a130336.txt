Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide is the organosilicon compound with the formula NaN(Si(CH3)3)2. This species, usually called NaHMDS (sodium hexamethyldisilazide), is a strong base used for deprotonation reactions or base-catalyzed reactions. Its advantages are that it is commercially available as a solid and it is soluble not only in ethers, such as THF or diethyl ether, but also in aromatic solvents, like benzene and toluene by virtue of the lipophilic TMS groups.
NaHMDS is quickly destroyed by water to form sodium hydroxide and bis(trimethylsilyl)amine.
