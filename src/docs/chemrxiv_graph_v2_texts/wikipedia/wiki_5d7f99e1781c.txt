Caesium hydroxide is a strong base (pKa= 15.76) containing the highly reactive alkali metal caesium, much like the other alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. It is the strongest of the five alkali metal hydroxides. Fused caesium hydroxide has applications in bringing glass samples into a solution for analytical purposes in the commercial glass industry and a defense waste processing facility as it is able to dissolve glass by attacking its silica framework. The melting process is carried out in a nickel or zirconium crucible. Caesium hydroxide fusion at 750Â°C produces complete dissolution of glass pellets.
Due to its high reactivity, caesium hydroxide is extremely hygroscopic. Laboratory caesium hydroxide is typically a hydrate.
It is an anisotropic etchant of silicon, exposing octahedral planes. This technique can form pyramids and regularly shaped etch pits for uses such as Microelectromechanical systems. It is known to have a higher selectivity to etch highly p-doped silicon than the more commonly used potassium hydroxide.
This compound is not commonly used in experiments due to the high extraction cost of caesium and its reactive behaviour. It acts in similar fashion to the compounds rubidium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, although more reactive.
