Cobalt(II) hydroxide or cobaltous hydroxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Co(OH)2, consisting of divalent cobalt cations Co2+ and hydroxide anions OH−. The pure compound, often called the "beta form" (β-Co(OH)2) is a pink solid insoluble in water.
The name is also applied to a related compound, often called "alpha" or "blue" form (α-Co(OH)2), which incorporates other anions in its molecular structure.  This compound is blue and rather unstable.
Cobalt(II) hydroxide is most used as a drying agent for paints, varnishes, and inks, in the preparation of other cobalt compounds, as a catalyst and in the manufacture of battery electrodes.
