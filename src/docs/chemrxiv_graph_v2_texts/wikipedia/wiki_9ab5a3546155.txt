Ethane (US:  ETH-ayn, UK:  EE-thayn) is a naturally occurring organic chemical compound with chemical formula C2H6. At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless, odorless gas. Like many hydrocarbons, ethane is isolated on an industrial scale from natural gas and as a petrochemical by-product of petroleum refining. Its chief use is as feedstock for ethylene production.  The ethyl group is formally, although rarely practically, derived from ethane.
