In physics, the elastic potential energy gained by a wire during elongation with a tensile (stretching) or compressive (contractile) force is called strain energy.  For linearly elastic materials, strain energy is:

  
    
      
        U
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        V
        σ
        ε
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        V
        E
        
          ε
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        
          
            V
            E
          
        
        
          σ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U={\frac {1}{2}}V\sigma \varepsilon ={\frac {1}{2}}VE\varepsilon ^{2}={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {V}{E}}\sigma ^{2}}
  

where σ is stress, ε is strain, V is volume, and E is Young's modulus:

  
    
      
        E
        =
        
          
            σ
            ε
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E={\frac {\sigma }{\varepsilon }}}
