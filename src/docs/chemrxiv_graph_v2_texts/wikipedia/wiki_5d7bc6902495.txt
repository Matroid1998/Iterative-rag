Fluoroboric acid or tetrafluoroboric acid (archaically, fluoboric acid) is an inorganic compound with the simplified chemical formula H+[BF4]−. Solvent-free tetrafluoroboric acid (H[BF4]) has not been reported. The term "fluoroboric acid" usually refers to a range of compounds including hydronium tetrafluoroborate ([H3O]+[BF4]−), which are available as solutions. The ethyl ether solvate is also commercially available, where the fluoroboric acid can be represented by the formula [H((CH3CH2)2O)n]+[BF4]−, where n is 2. 
It is mainly produced as a precursor to other fluoroborate salts. It is a strong acid. Fluoroboric acid is corrosive and attacks the skin. It is available commercially as a solution in water and other solvents such as diethyl ether. It is a strong acid with a weakly coordinating, non-oxidizing conjugate base. It is structurally similar to perchloric acid, but lacks the hazards associated with oxidants.
