Eliglustat, sold under the brand name Cerdelga, is a medication used for the treatment of Gaucher's disease. It was discovered at the University of Michigan, developed by Genzyme Corp, and was approved by the FDA in August 2014. Commonly used as the tartrate salt, the compound is believed to work by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase. According to an article in Journal of the American Medical Association the oral substrate reduction therapy resulted in "significant improvements in spleen volume, hemoglobin level, liver volume, and platelet count" in untreated adults with Gaucher disease Type 1.
