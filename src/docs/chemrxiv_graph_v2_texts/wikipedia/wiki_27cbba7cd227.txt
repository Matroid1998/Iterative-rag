DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to specific CpG sites in DNA, a process called DNA methylation. In humans, it is encoded by the DNMT1 gene. Dnmt1 forms part of the family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which consists primarily of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.
