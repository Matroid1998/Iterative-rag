A silicide is a type of chemical compound that combines silicon and a usually more electropositive element.
Silicon is more electropositive than carbon. In terms of their physical properties, silicides are structurally closer to borides than to carbides.  Because of size differences however silicides are not isostructural with borides and carbides.
Bonds in silicides range from conductive metal-like structures to covalent or ionic. Silicides of all non-transition metals have been described except beryllium.  Silicides are used in interconnects.
