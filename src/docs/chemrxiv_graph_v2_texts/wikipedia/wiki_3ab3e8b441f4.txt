Oxygen evolution is the chemical process of generating elemental diatomic oxygen (O2) by a chemical reaction, usually from water, the most abundant oxide compound in the universe. Oxygen evolution on Earth is effected by biotic oxygenic photosynthesis, photodissociation, hydroelectrolysis, and thermal decomposition of various oxides and oxyacids. When relatively pure oxygen is required industrially, it is isolated by distilling liquefied air.
Natural oxygen evolution is essential to the biological process of all complex life on Earth, as aerobic respiration has become the most important biochemical process of eukaryotic thermodynamics since eukaryotes evolved through symbiogenesis during the Proterozoic eon, and such consumption can only continue if oxygen is cyclically replenished by photosynthesis. The various oxygenation events during Earth's history had not only influenced changes in Earth's biosphere, but also significantly altered the atmospheric chemistry. The transition of Earth's atmosphere from an anoxic prebiotic reducing atmosphere high in methane and hydrogen sulfide to an oxidative atmosphere of which free nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of the mole fractions, had led to major climate changes and caused numerous icehouse phenomena and global glaciations.
In industries, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a limiting factor in the process of generating molecular oxygen through chemical reactions such as water splitting and electrolysis, and improved OER electrocatalysis is the key to the advancement of a number of renewable energy technologies such as solar fuels, regenerative fuel cells and metalâ€“air batteries.
