Copper(II) bromide (CuBr2) is a chemical compound that forms an unstable tetrahydrate CuBr2Â·4H2O. It is used in photographic processing as an intensifier and as a brominating agent in organic synthesis.
It is also used in the copper vapor laser, a class of laser where the medium is copper bromide vapour formed in-situ from hydrogen bromide reacting with the copper discharge tube. Producing yellow or green light, it is used in dermatological applications.
