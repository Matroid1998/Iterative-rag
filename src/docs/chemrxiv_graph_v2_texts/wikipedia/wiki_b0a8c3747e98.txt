Organolanthanide chemistry is the field of chemistry that studies organolanthanides, compounds with a lanthanide-carbon bond. Organolanthanide compounds are different from their organotransition metal analogues in the following ways:

They are far more air- and water-sensitive and are often pyrophoric.
Chemistry in the 0 oxidation state is far more limited. In fact, their electropositive nature makes their organometallic compounds more likely to be ionic.
They form no stable carbonyls at room temperature; organolanthanide carbonyl compounds have been observed only in argon matrices, and decompose when heated to 40 K.
