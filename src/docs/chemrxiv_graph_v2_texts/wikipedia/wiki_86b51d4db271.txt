Cinnamyl alcohol or styron is an organic compound that is found in esterified form in storax, Balsam of Peru, and cinnamon leaves.  It forms a white crystalline solid when pure, or a yellow oil when even slightly impure. It can be produced by the hydrolysis of storax.
Cinnamyl alcohol occurs naturally only in small quantities, so its industrial demand is usually fulfilled by chemical synthesis starting from cinnamaldehyde.
