Glutaraldehyde is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)3(CHO)2.  The molecule consists of a five carbon chain doubly terminated with formyl (CHO) groups.  It is usually used as a solution in water, and such solutions exists as a collection of hydrates, cyclic derivatives, and condensation products, several of which interconvert. Because the molecule has two aldehyde functional groups, glutaraldehyde (and its hydrates) can crosslink substances with primary amine groups, through condensation. Crosslinking can rigidify and deactivate proteins and other molecules that are critical for normal biological function, such as DNA, and so glutaraldehyde solutions are effective biocides and fixatives.  It is sold under the brandnames Cidex and Glutaral. As a disinfectant, it is used to sterilize surgical instruments.
