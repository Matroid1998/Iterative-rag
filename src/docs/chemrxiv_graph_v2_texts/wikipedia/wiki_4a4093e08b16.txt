An alkaline battery (IEC code: L) is a type of primary battery where the electrolyte (most commonly potassium hydroxide) has a pH value above 7. Typically, these batteries derive energy from the reaction between zinc metal and manganese dioxide.
Compared with zinc–carbon batteries of the Leclanché cell or zinc chloride types, alkaline batteries have a higher energy density and longer shelf life yet provide the same voltage.
The alkaline battery gets its name because it has an alkaline electrolyte of potassium hydroxide (KOH) instead of the acidic ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or zinc chloride (ZnCl2) electrolyte of the zinc–carbon batteries. Other battery systems also use alkaline electrolytes, but they use different active materials for the electrodes.
As of 2011, alkaline batteries accounted for 80% of manufactured batteries in the US and over 10 billion individual units produced worldwide. In Japan, alkaline batteries accounted for 46% of all primary battery sales. In Switzerland, alkaline batteries accounted for 68%, in the UK 60% and in the EU 47% of all battery sales including secondary types. 
Alkaline batteries contain zinc (Zn) and manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is a cumulative neurotoxin and can be toxic in higher concentrations. However, compared to other battery types, the toxicity of alkaline batteries is moderate.
Alkaline batteries are used in many household items such as portable media players, digital cameras, toys, flashlights, and radios.
