Azines are a functional class of organic compounds with the connectivity RR'C=N-N=CRR'. These compounds are the product of the condensation of hydrazine with ketones and aldehydes, although in practice they are often made by alternative routes. Ketazines are azines derived from ketones. For example, acetone azine is the simplest ketazine. Aldazines are azines derived from aldehydes.
