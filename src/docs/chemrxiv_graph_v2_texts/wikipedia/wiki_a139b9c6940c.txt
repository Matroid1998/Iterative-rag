Olaparib, sold under the brand name Lynparza, is a medication for the maintenance treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer in adults. It is a PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate, pancreatitis cancers.
In December 2014, olaparib was approved for use as a single agent by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the European Union and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States.
