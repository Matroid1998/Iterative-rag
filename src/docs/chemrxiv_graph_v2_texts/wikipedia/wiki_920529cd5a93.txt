In organic chemistry, hydrocyanation is a process for conversion of alkenes to nitriles.  The reaction involves the addition of hydrogen cyanide and requires a catalyst if the substrate alkene is unactivated.  This conversion is conducted on an industrial scale for the production of precursors to nylon.  Direct hydrocyanation is rare in the laboratory because hydrogen cyanide is extremely toxic, but transfer variants can allow other nitrilic compounds to serve as hydrogen cyanide synthons.
