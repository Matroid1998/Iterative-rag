Tetracene, also called naphthacene, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. It has the appearance of a pale orange powder. Tetracene is the four-ringed member of the series of acenes.
Tetracene is a molecular organic semiconductor, used in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Tetracene can be used as a gain medium in dye lasers as a sensitiser in chemoluminescence. Napthacene is the main component of the tetracycline class of antibiotics.
