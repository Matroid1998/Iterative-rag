In organic chemistry, a triketone or trione is an organic compound containing three ketone (>C=O) groups.  The simplest triketones, such as cyclopropanetrione and 2,3,4-pentanetrione, are only of occasional theoretical interest.  More pertinent are triacetylmethane and 2,4,6-heptanetrione.  Both species exist predominantly in the enol (C=CH) forms.
