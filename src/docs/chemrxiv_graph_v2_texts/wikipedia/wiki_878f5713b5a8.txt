The bismuthide ion is Bi3âˆ’ but the term is often used to describe less reduced forms of bismuth.
Bismuthides are compounds of bismuth with more electropositive elements. A wide variety are known.  
The stoichiometry of bismuthides ranges from lithium bismuthide (Li3Bi), which can be viewed as the Li+ salt of Bi3-.  The corresponding sodium and potassium derivatives are also known.  They all prepared by heating the elements.
In terms of Bi-rich phases, examples are LiBi, KBi2, CaBi3, which exhibit strong Bi-Bi bonding. Some are intermetallic compounds, containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.  The majority of bismuthides adopt efficient packing arrangements and become densely packed structures, which is a characteristic of intermetallic compounds.
