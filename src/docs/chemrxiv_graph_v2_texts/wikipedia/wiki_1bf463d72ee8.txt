Cuprates are a class of compounds that contain copper (Cu) atom(s) in an anion. They can be broadly categorized into two main types:
1. Inorganic cuprates: These compounds have a general formula of XYCumOn. Some of them are non-stoichiometric. Many of these compounds are known for their superconducting properties. An example of an inorganic cuprate is the tetrachloridocuprate(II) or tetrachlorocuprate(II) ([CuCl4]2−), an anionic coordination complex that features a copper atom in an oxidation state of +2, surrounded by four chloride ions.
2. Organic cuprates: These are organocopper compounds, some of which having a general formula of [CuR2]−, where copper is in an oxidation state of +1, where at least one of the R groups can be any organic group. These compounds, characterized by copper bonded to organic groups, are frequently used in organic synthesis due to their reactivity. An example of an organic cuprate is dimethylcuprate(I) anion [Cu(CH3)2]−.
One of the most studied cuprates is YBa2Cu3O7, a high-temperature superconducting material. This oxide cuprate has been the subject of extensive research due to its ability to conduct electricity without resistance at relatively high temperatures.
The term 'cuprate' originates from 'cuprum', the Latin word for copper. It is primarily used in the context of oxide materials, anionic coordination complexes, and anionic organocopper compounds, reflecting the diverse roles of copper in chemistry. The term is mainly used in three contexts: oxide materials, anionic coordination complexes, and anionic organocopper compounds.
