Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions, that does not assume any functional forms. It is usually employed to optimize expensive-to-evaluate functions. With the rise of artificial intelligence innovation in the 21st century, Bayesian optimizations have found prominent use in machine learning problems for optimizing hyperparameter values.
