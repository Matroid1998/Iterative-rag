Graphane is a two-dimensional polymer of carbon and hydrogen with the formula unit (CH)n where n is large. Partial hydrogenation results in hydrogenated graphene, which was reported by Elias et al. in 2009 by a TEM study to be "direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative". The authors viewed the panorama as "a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties". With the band gap ranges from 0 to 0.8 eV
