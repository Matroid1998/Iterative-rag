Propylene, also known as propene, is an unsaturated organic compound with the chemical formula CH3CH=CH2. It has one double bond, and is the second simplest member of the alkene class of hydrocarbons. It is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor.
Propylene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It was discovered in 1850 by A. W. von Hoffmann's student Captain (later Major General) John Williams Reynolds as the only gaseous product of thermal decomposition of amyl alcohol to react with chlorine and bromine.
