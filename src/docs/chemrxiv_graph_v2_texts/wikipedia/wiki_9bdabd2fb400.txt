A sorbent is an insoluble material that either absorbs or adsorbs liquids or gases. They are frequently used to remove pollutants and in the cleanup of chemical accidents and oil spills. Besides their uses in industry, sorbents are used in commercial products such as diapers and odor absorbents, and are researched for applications in environmental air analysis, particularly in the analysis of volatile organic compounds. The name sorbent is derived from sorption, which is itself a derivation from adsorption and absorption.
