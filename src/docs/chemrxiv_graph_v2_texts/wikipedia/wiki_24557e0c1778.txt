Organoboron chemistry or organoborane chemistry studies organoboron compounds, also called organoboranes.  These chemical compounds combine boron and carbon; typically, they are organic derivatives of borane (BH3), as in the trialkyl boranes.
Organoboranes and -borates enable many chemical transformations in organic chemistry — most importantly, hydroboration and carboboration.  Most reactions transfer a nucleophilic boron substituent to an electrophilic center either inter- or intramolecularly.  In particular, α,β-unsaturated borates and borates with an α leaving group are highly susceptible to intramolecular 1,2-migration of a group from boron to the electrophilic α position. Oxidation or protonolysis of the resulting organoboranes generates many organic products, including alcohols, carbonyl compounds, alkenes, and halides.
