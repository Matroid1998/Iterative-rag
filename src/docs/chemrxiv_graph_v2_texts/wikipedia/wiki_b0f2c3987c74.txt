Phosphatidylinositol or inositol phospholipid is a biomolecule. It was initially called "inosite" when it was discovered by LÃ©on Maquenne and Johann Joseph von Scherer in the late 19th century. It was discovered in bacteria but later also found in eukaryotes, and was found to be a signaling molecule.
The biomolecule can exist in 9 different isomers. It is a lipid which contains a phosphate group, two fatty acid chains, and one inositol sugar molecule. Typically, the phosphate group has a negative charge (at physiological pH values). As a result, the molecule is amphiphilic.
The production of the molecule is limited to the endoplasmic reticulum.
