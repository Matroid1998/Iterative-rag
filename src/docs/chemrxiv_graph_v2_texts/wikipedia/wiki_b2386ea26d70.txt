Orthosilicic acid () is an inorganic compound with the formula Si(OH)4. Although rarely observed, it is the key compound of silica and silicates and the precursor to other silicic acids [H2xSiOx+2]n. Silicic acids play important roles in biomineralization and technology. It is the parent acid of the orthosilicate anion SiO4âˆ’4.
