Methylene (IUPAC name: methylidene, also called carbene or methene) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH2 (also written [CH2] and not to be confused with compressed hydrogen, which is also denoted CH2). It is a colourless gas that fluoresces in the mid-infrared range, and only persists in dilution, or as an adduct.
Methylene is the simplest carbene.: p.7  It is usually detected only at very low temperatures or as a short-lived intermediate in chemical reactions.
