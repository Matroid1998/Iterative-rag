Apabetalone (development codes RVX 208, RVX-208, and RVX000222) is an orally available small molecule created by Resverlogix Corp. that is being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD).  In the phase II clinical trial ASSURE in patients with angiographic coronary disease and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, apabetalone showed no greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) levels or incremental regression of atherosclerosis than administration of placebo, while causing a statistically significant greater incidence of elevated liver enzymes. However, pooled analysis of the effect of apabetalone in three phase II clinical trials ASSERT, ASSURE, and SUSTAIN demonstrated increases in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) levels, as well as decreases in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Reduction of MACE was more profound in patients with diabetes mellitus. In a short-term study in prediabetics, favorable changes in glucose metabolism were observed in patients receiving apabetalone. An international, multicenter phase III trial, “Effect of RVX000222 on Time to Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in High-Risk Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subjects with Coronary Artery Disease” (BETonMACE) commenced in October 2015.  The trial is designed to determine whether apabetalone in combination with statins can decrease cardiac events compared to treatment with statins alone.
