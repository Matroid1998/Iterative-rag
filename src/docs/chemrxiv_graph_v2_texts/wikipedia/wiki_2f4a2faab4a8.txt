Polyfluorene is a polymer with formula (C13H8)n, consisting of fluorene units linked in a linear chain â€” specifically, at carbon atoms 2 and 7 in the standard fluorene numbering.  It can also be described as a chain of benzene rings linked in para positions (a polyparaphenylene) with an extra methylene bridge connecting every pair of rings.
The two benzene rings in each unit make polyfluorene an aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically conjugated polymer, and give it notable optical and electrical properties, such as efficient photoluminescence.
When spoken about as a class, polyfluorenes are derivatives of this polymer, obtained by replacing some of the hydrogen atoms by other chemical groups, and/or by substituting other monomers for some fluorene units. These polymers are being investigated for possible use in light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, plastic solar cells, and other organic electronic applications.  They stand out among other luminescent conjugated polymers because the wavelength of their light output can be tuned through the entire visible spectrum by appropriate choice of the substituents.
