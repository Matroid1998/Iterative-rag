In category theory, the coproduct, or categorical sum, is a construction which includes as examples the disjoint union of sets and of topological spaces, the free product of groups, and the direct sum of modules and vector spaces.  The coproduct of a family of objects is essentially the "least specific" object to which each object in the family admits a morphism.  It is the category-theoretic dual notion to the categorical product,  which means the definition is the same as the product but with all arrows reversed. Despite this seemingly innocuous change in the name and notation, coproducts can be and typically are dramatically different from products within a given category.
