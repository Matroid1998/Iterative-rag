Phthalocyanine (H2Pc) is a large, aromatic, macrocyclic, organic compound with the formula (C8H4N2)4H2 and is of theoretical or specialized interest in chemical dyes and photoelectricity.
It is composed of four isoindole units linked by a ring of nitrogen atoms. (C8H4N2)4H2 = H2Pc has a two-dimensional geometry and a ring system consisting of 18 π-electrons. The extensive delocalization of the π-electrons affords the molecule useful properties, lending itself to applications in dyes and pigments. Metal complexes derived from Pc2−, the conjugate base of H2Pc, are valuable in catalysis, organic solar cells, and photodynamic therapy.
