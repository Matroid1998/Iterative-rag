Opicapone, sold under the brand name Ongentys, is a medication which is administered together with levodopa in people with Parkinson's disease. Opicapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor.
The most common side effects are dyskinesia (difficulty controlling movement), constipation, increased blood creatine kinase, hypotension/syncope, and decreased weight.
Opicapone, works to restore the levels of dopamine in the parts of the brain that control movement and coordination. It enhances the effects of levodopa, a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine that can be taken by mouth. Opicapone blocks an enzyme that breaks down levodopa in the body called catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). It is peripherally selective and does not inhibit COMT in the brain. As a result of its COMT inhibition, levodopa remains active for longer. This helps to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as stiffness and slowness of movement.
In June 2016, it was authorised for use in the European Union. It was authorised for use in the United States in April 2020.
