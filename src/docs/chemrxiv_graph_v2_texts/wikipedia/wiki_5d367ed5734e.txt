In electrical engineering, low voltage is a relative term, the definition varying by context.  Different definitions are used in electric power transmission and distribution, compared with electronics design. Electrical safety codes define "low voltage" circuits that are exempt from the protection required at higher voltages. These definitions vary by country and specific codes or regulations.
