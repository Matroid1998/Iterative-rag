Limonoids are phytochemicals of the triterpenoid class which are abundant in sweet or sour-scented citrus fruit and other plants of the families Cucurbitaceae, Rutaceae, and Meliaceae. Certain limonoids are antifeedants such as azadirachtin from the neem tree.
Chemically, the limonoids consist of variations of the furanolactone core structure.  The prototypical structure consists of four six-membered rings and a furan ring.  Limonoids are classed as tetranortriterpenes.
