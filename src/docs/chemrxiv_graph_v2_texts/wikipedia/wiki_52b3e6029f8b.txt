In organic chemistry, a carbyne is a general term for any compound whose structure consists of an electrically neutral carbon atom connected by a single covalent bond and has three non-bonded electrons. The carbon atom has either one or three unpaired electrons, depending on its excitation state; making it a radical. The chemical formula can be written R−C· or R−C3· (also written as ⫶C−R), or just CH.
Carbynes can be seen as derivatives of the simplest such compound, the methylidyne radical or unsubstituted carbyne H−C· or H−C3·, in which the functional group is a hydrogen atom.
Reported for the first time back in 1967 by Kasatochkin, carbyne is an infinite sp1 hybridized long linear chain of carbon, where each link is just a single carbon atom.
