Lenalidomide, sold under the brand name Revlimid among others, is a medication used to treat multiple myeloma, smoldering myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). For multiple myeloma, it is a first line treatment, and is given with dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include diarrhea, itchiness, joint pain, fever, headache, and trouble sleeping. Severe side effects include low blood platelets, low white blood cells, and blood clots. The dose may need to be adjusted in people with kidney problems.  Lenalidomide is closely related to thalidomide, which is known to cause severe birth defects, so its use during pregnancy is very likely to harm the fetus. 
Lenalidomide belongs to a class of drugs known as immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) or Cereblon E3 ligase modulators, which includes thalidomide and its analogs. In lymphocytes, these drugs target an E3 ubiquitin ligase and change its specificity to include new targets. This results in the rapid degradation of several disease-related proteins including IKZF1, IKZF3, and CSNK1A1.
Lenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
