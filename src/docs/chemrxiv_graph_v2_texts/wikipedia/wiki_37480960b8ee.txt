Unlike its lighter congeners, the halogen iodine forms a number of stable organic compounds, in which iodine exhibits higher formal oxidation states than -1 or coordination number exceeding 1.  These are the hypervalent organoiodines, often called iodanes after the IUPAC rule used to name them.  
These iodine compounds are hypervalent because the iodine atom formally contains in its valence shell more than the 8 electrons required for the octet rule.  Hypervalent iodine oxyanions are known for oxidation states +1, +3, +5, and +7; organic analogues of these moieties are known for each oxidation state except +7.  
In terms of chemical behavior, λ3‑ and λ5‑iodanes are generally oxidizing and/or electrophilic species.  They have been widely applied towards those ends in organic synthesis.
