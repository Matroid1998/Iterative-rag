Methylcyclohexane (cyclohexylmethane) is an organic compound with the molecular formula is CH3C6H11. Classified as saturated hydrocarbon, it is a colourless liquid with a faint odor.
Methylcyclohexane is used as a solvent. It is mainly converted in naphtha reformers to toluene. A special use is in PF-1 priming fluid in cruise missiles to aid engine start-up when they run on special nonvolatile jet fuel like JP-10.
