Mimosine or leucenol is a toxic non-protein amino acid chemically similar to tyrosine. It occurs in some Mimosa spp. (including M. pudica) and all members of the closely related genus Leucaena.
This compound, also known as leucenol, was first isolated from the seeds of Leucaena glauca Benth., and was later investigated by Adams and coworkers.
