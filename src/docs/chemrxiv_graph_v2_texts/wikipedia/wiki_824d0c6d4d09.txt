Lead selenide (PbSe), or lead(II) selenide, a selenide of lead, is a semiconductor material. It forms cubic crystals of the NaCl structure; it has a direct bandgap of 0.27 eV at room temperature.  (Note that incorrectly identifies PbSe and other IVâ€“VI semiconductors as indirect gap materials.)  A grey solid, it is used for manufacture of infrared detectors for thermal imaging. 
The mineral clausthalite is a naturally occurring lead selenide.
It may be formed by direct reaction between its constituent elements, lead and selenium.
