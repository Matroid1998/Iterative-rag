In chemistry, a phosphide is a compound containing the P3âˆ’ ion or its equivalent.  Many different phosphides are known, with widely differing structures.  Most commonly encountered on the binary phosphides, i.e. those materials consisting only of phosphorus and a less electronegative element.  Numerous are polyphosphides, which are solids consisting of anionic chains or clusters of phosphorus.  Phosphides are known with the majority of less electronegative elements with the exception of Hg, Pb, Sb, Bi, Te, and Po.  Finally, some phosphides are molecular.
