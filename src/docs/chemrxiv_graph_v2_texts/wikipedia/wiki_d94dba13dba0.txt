Lead oxides are a group of inorganic compounds with formulas including lead (Pb) and oxygen (O).
Common lead oxides include:

Lead(II) oxide, PbO, litharge (red), massicot (yellow)
Lead tetroxide or red lead, Pb3O4, minium, which is a lead (II,IV) oxide and may be thought of as lead(II) orthoplumbate(IV) [Pb2+]2[PbO4−4], vivid orange crystals
Lead dioxide (lead(IV) oxide), PbO2, dark-brown or black powder
Less common lead oxides are:

Lead sesquioxide, Pb2O3, which is a lead (II,IV) oxide as well (lead(II) metaplumbate(IV) [Pb2+][PbO2−3]), reddish yellow
Pb12O19, monoclinic, dark-brown or black crystals
The so-called black lead oxide, which is a mixture of PbO and fine-powdered Pb metal and used in the production of lead–acid batteries.
