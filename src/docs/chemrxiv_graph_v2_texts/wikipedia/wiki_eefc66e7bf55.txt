In organic chemistry, an epoxide is a cyclic ether, where the ether forms a three-atom ring: two atoms of carbon and one atom of oxygen.  This triangular structure has substantial ring strain, making epoxides highly reactive, more so than other ethers.  They are produced on a large scale for many applications.  In general, low molecular weight epoxides are colourless and nonpolar, and often volatile.
