The cytochrome complex, or cyt c, is a small hemeprotein found loosely associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where it plays a critical role in cellular respiration. 
It transfers electrons between Complexes III (Coenzyme Q â€“ Cyt c reductase) and IV (Cyt c oxidase). Cytochrome c is highly water-soluble, unlike other cytochromes. It is capable of undergoing oxidation and reduction as its iron atom converts between the ferrous and ferric forms, but does not bind oxygen.  It also plays a major role in cell apoptosis. In humans, cytochrome c is encoded by the CYCS gene.
