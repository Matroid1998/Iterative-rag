Histone deacetylase 10 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HDAC10 gene. HDAC10 is a class IIb HDAC. It specifically has selectivity for long, slender polyamines like N8-acetylspermidine. 
Acetylation of histone core particles modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. The opposing enzymatic activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, such as HDAC10, determine the acetylation status of histone tails (Kao et al., 2002).[supplied by OMIM]
