Dibenzothiophene (DBT, diphenylene sulfide) is the organosulfur compound consisting of two benzene rings fused to a central thiophene ring. It has the chemical formula C12H8S. It is a colourless solid that is chemically somewhat similar to anthracene. This tricyclic heterocycle, and especially its disubstituted derivative 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene are problematic impurities in petroleum.
