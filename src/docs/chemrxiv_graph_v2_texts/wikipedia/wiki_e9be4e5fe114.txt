Sugar phosphates (sugars that have added or substituted phosphate groups) are often used in biological systems to store or transfer energy. They also form the backbone for DNA and RNA. Sugar phosphate backbone geometry is altered in the vicinity of the modified nucleotides.
Examples include:

Dihydroxyacetonephosphate
Glucose-6-phosphate
Phytic acid
Teichoic acid
