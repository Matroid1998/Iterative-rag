Fluorene , or 9H-fluorene is an organic compound with the formula (C6H4)2CH2. It forms white crystals that exhibit a characteristic, aromatic odor similar to that of naphthalene. Despite its name, it does not contain the element fluorine, but rather it comes from the violet fluorescence it exhibits. For commercial purposes it is obtained from coal tar, where it was discovered and named by Marcellin Berthelot in 1867.
It is insoluble in water and soluble in many organic solvents. Although sometimes classified as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the five-membered ring has no aromatic properties. Fluorene is mildly acidic.
