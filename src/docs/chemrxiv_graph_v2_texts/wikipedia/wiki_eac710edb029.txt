Rhodamine  is a family of related dyes, a subset of the triarylmethane dyes. They are derivatives of xanthene.  Important members of the rhodamine family are rhodamine 6G, Rhodamin WT, Texas Red (Sulforhodamin 101), rhodamine 123, and rhodamine B. They are mainly used to dye paper and inks, but they lack the lightfastness for fabric dyeing.
