Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is a process through which surrounding thermal energy changes population of excited states of molecular compounds and thus, alters light emission. The TADF process usually involves an excited molecular species in a triplet state, which commonly has a forbidden transition to the singlet ground state, termed phosphorescence. By absorbing nearby thermal energy, the triplet state can undergo reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) converting the triplet state population to an excited  singlet state, which then emits light to the singlet ground state in a delayed process termed delayed fluorescence. Accordingly, in many cases, the TADF molecules show two types of emission, a delayed fluorescence and a prompt fluorescence. This is found for specific organic molecules, but also for selected organo-transition metal compounds, such as Cu(I) complexes. Along with traditional organic fluorescent molecules and phosphorescent organo-transition metal complexes, TADF compounds belong to the three main light-emitting material groups used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).
