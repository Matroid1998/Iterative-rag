Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is an important extension of  the chemical ligation concept for constructing a larger polypeptide chain  by the covalent condensation of two or more unprotected peptides segments. Native chemical ligation is the most effective method for synthesizing native or modified proteins of typical size (i.e.,  proteins< ~300 AA).
