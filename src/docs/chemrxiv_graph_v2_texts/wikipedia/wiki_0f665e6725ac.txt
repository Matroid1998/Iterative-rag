Nitrofurazone (INN, trade name Furacin) is an antimicrobial organic compound belonging to the nitrofuran class.  It is most commonly used as a topical antibiotic ointment.  It is effective against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and can be used in the treatment of trypanosomiasis.  Its use in medicine has become less frequent, as safer and more effective products have become available.  Nitrofurazone is listed under California Prop 65, and has demonstrated clear evidence to be mutagenic and carcinogenic during animal studies, and has been discontinued for human use in the USA. The substance is pale yellow and crystalline.  It was once widely used as an antibiotic for livestock.
