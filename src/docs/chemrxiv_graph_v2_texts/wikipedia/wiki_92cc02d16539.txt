Xanthine ( or , from Ancient Greek ξανθός xanthós 'yellow' for its yellowish-white appearance; archaically xanthic acid; systematic name 3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione) is a purine base found in most human body tissues and fluids, as well as in other organisms. Several stimulants are derived from xanthine, including caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine.
Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation.

It is created from guanine by guanine deaminase.
It is created from hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase.
It is also created from xanthosine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
Xanthine is subsequently converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme.
