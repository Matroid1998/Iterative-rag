Tungsten diselenide is an inorganic compound with the formula WSe2.  The compound adopts a hexagonal crystalline structure similar to molybdenum disulfide. The tungsten atoms are covalently bonded to six selenium ligands in a trigonal prismatic coordination sphere while each selenium is bonded to three tungsten atoms in a pyramidal geometry. The tungstenâ€“selenium bond has a length of 0.2526 nm, and the distance between selenium atoms is 0.334 nm.  It is a well studied example of a layered material.  The layers stack together via van der Waals interactions. WSe2 is a very stable semiconductor in the group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides.
