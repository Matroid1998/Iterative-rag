Nitrosamines (or more formally N-nitrosamines) are organic compounds produced by industrial processes. The chemical structure is R2Nâˆ’N=O, where R is usually an alkyl group. Nitrosamines have a nitroso group (NO+) that are "probable human carcinogens", bonded to a deprotonated amine. Most nitrosamines are carcinogenic in animals. A 2006 systematic review supports a "positive association between nitrite and nitrosamine intake and gastric cancer, between meat and processed meat intake and gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer, and between preserved fish, vegetable and smoked food intake and gastric cancer, but is not conclusive".
