Pyrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of four fused benzene rings, resulting in a flat aromatic system.  The chemical formula is C16H10.  This yellow-green solid is the smallest peri-fused PAH (one where the rings are fused through more than one face).  Pyrene forms during incomplete combustion of organic compounds.
