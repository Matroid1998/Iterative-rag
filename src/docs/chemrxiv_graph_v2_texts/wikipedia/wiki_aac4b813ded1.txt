In organic chemistry, the diazo group is an organic moiety consisting of two linked nitrogen atoms at the terminal position.  Overall charge-neutral organic compounds containing the diazo group bound to a carbon atom are called diazo compounds or diazoalkanes and are described by the general structural formula R2C=N+=N−. The simplest example of a diazo compound is diazomethane, CH2N2.  Diazo compounds (R2C=N2) should not be confused with azo compounds (R−N=N−R) or with diazonium compounds (R−N+2).
