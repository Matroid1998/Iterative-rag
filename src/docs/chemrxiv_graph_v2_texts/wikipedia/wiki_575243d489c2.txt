In organic chemistry, polyenes are poly-unsaturated, organic compounds that contain at least three alternating double (C=C) and single (C−C) carbon–carbon bonds. These carbon–carbon double bonds interact in a process known as conjugation, resulting in some unusual optical properties.  Related to polyenes are dienes, where there are only two alternating double and single bonds.
The following polyenes are used as antimycotics for humans: amphotericin B, nystatin, candicidin, pimaricin, methyl partricin, and trichomycin.
