Sodium periodate is an inorganic salt, composed of a sodium cation and the periodate anion. It may also be regarded as the sodium salt of periodic acid. Like many periodates, it can exist in two different forms: sodium metaperiodate (formula‚Äç NaIO4) and sodium orthoperiodate (normally Na2H3IO6, but sometimes the fully reacted salt Na5IO6). Both salts are useful oxidising agents.
