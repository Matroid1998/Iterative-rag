Cannabigerol (CBG) is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid and minor constituent of cannabis. It is one of more than 120 identified cannabinoids found in the plant genus Cannabis. The compound is the decarboxylated form of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the parent molecule from which other cannabinoids are biosynthesized.
During plant growth, most of the CBG is converted into other cannabinoids, primarily tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD), leaving about 1% CBG in the plant. Some strains, however, produce larger amounts of CBG and CBGA, while having low quantities of other cannabinoids, like THC and CBD.
The pharmacodynamics of CBG are complex. It is a relatively weak ligand of the cannabinoid receptors, where it acts as a weak partial agonist. Conversely, it is a much more potent agonist of the α2-adrenergic receptor, antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, and antagonist of the transient receptor potential channel TRPM8. CBG also has a variety of other actions that may additionally contribute to its effects.
Although CBG is sold as a dietary supplement, its effects and safety for human consumption are unknown. Safety concerns have been raised due to the potent activation of α2-adrenergic receptors by CBG, which may produce sedation and potentially undesirable cardiovascular effects like decreased heart rate and blood pressure.
