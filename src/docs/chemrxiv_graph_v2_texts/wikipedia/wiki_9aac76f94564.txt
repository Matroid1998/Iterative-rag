Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) refers to polyurethane polymers which exhibit thermoplasticity; that is, they become pliable when heated and harden when cooled. This is in contrast to most polyurethanes, which are thermosets that harden irreversibly. 
Thermoplastic polyurethanes have many desirable properties, including elasticity, transparency, and resistance to oil, grease, and abrasion.  Technically, they are thermoplastic elastomers consisting of linear segmented block copolymers composed of hard and soft segments.
