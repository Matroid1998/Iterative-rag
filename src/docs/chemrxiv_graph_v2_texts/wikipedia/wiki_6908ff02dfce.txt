BNT 2 (Bulgarian: БНТ 2, romanized: Be ne te dve) is a Bulgarian-language public television station, operated by Bulgarian National Television. It is the successor to the defunct second program of the national television - Efir 2. 
Launched on October 16, 2011, the channel replaced the five regional television centers of BNT - BNT Pirin, BNT More, BNT Sever, BNT Plovdiv and BNT Sofia by combining their programs into one. Until 2018, BNT 2 broadcast original programs, newscasts and sporting events. The program includes a "regional programming bloc" with local opt-out broadcasts from BNT's regional television centers.
Since 2018, BNT 2 has ended its newscasts and is only currently mostly broadcasting cultural programs and programs produced by BNT's regional television centers (which includes local-based newscasts instead of sending local news production to be broadcast nationally).
