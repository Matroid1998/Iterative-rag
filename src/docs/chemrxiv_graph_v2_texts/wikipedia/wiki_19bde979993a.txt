Tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) is an organic compound with the formula ((CH3)2N)2C=C(N(CH3)2)2,  It is a colorless liquid. It is classified as an enamine. Primary and secondary enamines tend to isomerize, but tertiary enamines are kinetically stable. One unusual feature of TDAE is that it is a tetra-enamine. The pi-donating tendency of the amine groups strongly enhances the basicity of the molecule, which does exhibit properties of a typical alkene.
