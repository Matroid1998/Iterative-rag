In organic chemistry, enols are a type of functional group or intermediate in organic chemistry containing a group with the formula C=C(OH) (R = many substituents). The term enol is an abbreviation of alkenol, a portmanteau deriving from "-ene"/"alkene" and the "-ol".  Many kinds of enols are known.
Ketoâ€“enol tautomerism refers to a chemical equilibrium between a "keto" form (a carbonyl, named for the common ketone case) and an enol. The interconversion of the two forms involves the transfer of an alpha hydrogen atom and the reorganisation of bonding electrons. The keto and enol forms are tautomers of each other.
