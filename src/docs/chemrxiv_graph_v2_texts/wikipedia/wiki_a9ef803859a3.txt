Zinc chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula  ZnCl2Â·nH2O, with n ranging from 0 to 4.5, forming hydrates. Zinc chloride, anhydrous and its hydrates, are colorless or white crystalline solids, and are highly soluble in water. Five hydrates of zinc chloride are known, as well as four polymorphs of anhydrous zinc chloride.
All forms of zinc chloride are deliquescent. They can usually be produced by the reaction of zinc or its compounds with some form of hydrogen chloride. Anhydrous zinc compound is a Lewis acid, readily forming complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, chemical synthesis of organic compounds, such as benzaldehyde, and processes to produce other compounds of zinc.
