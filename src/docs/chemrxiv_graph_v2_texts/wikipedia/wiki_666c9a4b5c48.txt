The retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are natural derivatives of vitamin A or are chemically related to it. Synthetic retinoids are utilized in cosmetic formulations, clinical dermatology, and the treatment of some forms of cancer.
Retinoids have many important functions throughout the body, including in vision, regulation of skin proliferation and differentiation, growth of bone tissue, immune function, and male fertility.
The biology of retinoids is complex, having well-documented effectiveness in the management of conditions ranging from acute promyelocytic leukemia to acne to photoaging. On the other hand, retinoids may be involved in metabolic dysfunction and, at least in some forms, carcinogenesis.
