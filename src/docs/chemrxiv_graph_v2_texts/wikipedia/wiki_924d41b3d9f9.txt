Cyanines, also referred to as tetramethylindo(di)-carbocyanines are a synthetic dye family belonging to the polymethine group.  Although the name derives etymologically from terms for shades of blue, the cyanine family covers the electromagnetic spectrum from near IR to UV.
Chemically, cyanines are a conjugated system between two nitrogen atoms; in each resonance structure, exactly one nitrogen atom is oxidized to an iminium.  Typically, they form part of a nitrogenous heterocyclic system.
The main application for cyanine dyes is in biological labeling.  Nevertheless, there is a wide literature on both their synthesis and uses, and cyanines are common in some CD and DVD media.
