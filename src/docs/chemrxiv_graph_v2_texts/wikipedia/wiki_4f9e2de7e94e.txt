Mycolic acids are long fatty acids found in the cell walls of Mycobacteriales taxon, a group of bacteria that includes Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease tuberculosis.  They form the major component of the cell wall of many Mycobacteriales species.  Despite their name, mycolic acids have no biological link to fungi; the name arises from the filamentous appearance their presence gives Mycobacteriales under high magnification.  The presence of mycolic acids in the cell wall also gives Mycobacteriales a distinct gross morphological trait known as "cording".  Mycolic acids were first isolated by Stodola et al. in 1938 from an extract of M. tuberculosis.
Mycolic acids are composed of a longer beta-hydroxy chain with a shorter alpha-alkyl side chain.  Each molecule contains between 60 and 90 carbon atoms.  The exact number of carbons varies by species and can be used as an identification aid.  Most mycolic acids also contain various functional groups.
