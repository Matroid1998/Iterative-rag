Tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt(III) is the coordination complex with the formula Co(C5H7O2)3. Often abbreviated Co(acac)3, it is a green, diamagnetic solid that is soluble in organic solvents, but not in water. Owing to its solubility in organic solvents, tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt(III) is used to produce homogeneous catalysts by reduction.
