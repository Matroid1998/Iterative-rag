Sesquiterpenes are a class of terpenes that consist of three isoprene units and often have the molecular formula C15H24. Like monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes may be cyclic or contain rings, including many combinations. Biochemical modifications such as oxidation or rearrangement produce the related sesquiterpenoids.  It is estimated (2006) that 3000 sesquiterpenes have been identified.
