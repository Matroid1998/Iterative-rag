Diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP), also known as diisopropyl methane-phosphonate and phosphonic acid and methyl-bis-(1-methylethyl)ester, is a chemical by-product in the production of sarin gas when two equivalents of isopropyl alcohol react with methylphosphonyl difluoride instead of one.
DIMP is a colorless liquid that has been shown to affect the hematological (blood forming) system in animals. Its chemical formula is C7H17O3P.
It degrades into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid.
