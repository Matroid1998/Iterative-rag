In organic chemistry, a diene ( DY-een); also diolefin,  dy-OH-l…ô-fin) or alkadiene) is a covalent compound that contains two double bonds, usually among carbon atoms. They thus contain two alkene units, with the standard prefix di of systematic nomenclature.  As a subunit of more complex molecules, dienes occur in naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals and are used in organic synthesis.  Conjugated dienes are widely used as monomers in the polymer industry. Polyunsaturated fats are of interest to nutrition.
