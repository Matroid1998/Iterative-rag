A solvated electron is a free electron in a solution, in which it behaves like an anion. An electron's being solvated in a solution means it is bound by the solution. The notation for a solvated electron in formulas of chemical reactions is "e−". Often, discussions of solvated electrons focus on their solutions in ammonia, which are stable for days, but solvated electrons also occur in water and many other solvents –  in fact, in any solvent that mediates outer-sphere electron transfer.  The solvated electron is responsible for a great deal of radiation chemistry.
