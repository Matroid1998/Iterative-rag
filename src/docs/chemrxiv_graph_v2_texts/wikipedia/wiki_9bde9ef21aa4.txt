A neodymium magnet (also known as NdFeB, NIB or Neo magnet) is a permanent magnet made from an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron to form the Nd2Fe14B tetragonal crystalline structure.  They are the most widely used type of rare-earth magnet.
Developed independently in 1984 by General Motors and  Sumitomo Special Metals, neodymium magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnet available commercially.   They have replaced other types of magnets in many applications in modern products that require strong permanent magnets, such as electric motors in cordless tools, hard disk drives and magnetic fasteners.
NdFeB magnets can be classified as sintered or bonded, depending on the manufacturing process used.
