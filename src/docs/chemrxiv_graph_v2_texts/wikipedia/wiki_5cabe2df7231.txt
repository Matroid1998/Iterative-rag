Tetraethyl orthosilicate, formally named tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), ethyl silicate is the organic chemical compound with the formula Si(OC2H5)4.  TEOS is a colorless liquid. It degrades in water.  TEOS is the ethyl ester of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)4.  It is the most prevalent alkoxide of silicon.
TEOS is a tetrahedral molecule. Like its many analogues, it is prepared by alcoholysis of silicon tetrachloride:

SiCl4  +  4 EtOH â†’ Si(OEt)4  +  4 HCl
where Et is the ethyl group, C2H5, and thus EtOH is ethanol.
