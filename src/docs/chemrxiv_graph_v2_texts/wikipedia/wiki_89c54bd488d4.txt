Clotrimazole, sold under the brand name Lotrimin, among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, tinea versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina.
Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness. When applied to the skin, common side effects include redness and a burning sensation. In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is believed to be safe. There is no evidence of harm when used by mouth during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane.
Clotrimazole was discovered in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2021, it was the 273rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.
