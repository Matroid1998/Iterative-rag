1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) is an organic compound that is often used as a ligand for transition-metal catalysed asymmetric synthesis. BINOL has axial chirality and the two enantiomers can be readily separated and are stable toward racemisation.  The specific rotation of the two enantiomers is 35.5° (c = 1 in THF), with the R enantiomer being the dextrorotary one. BINOL is a precursor for another chiral ligand called BINAP. The volumetric mass density of the two enantiomers is 0.62 g cm−3.
