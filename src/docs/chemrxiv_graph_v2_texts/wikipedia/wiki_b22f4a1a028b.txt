Methacrylic acid, abbreviated MAA, is an organic compound with the formula CH2=C(CH3)CO2H.  This colorless, viscous liquid is a carboxylic acid with an acrid unpleasant odor.  It is soluble in warm water and miscible with most organic solvents. Methacrylic acid is produced industrially on a large scale as a precursor to its esters, especially methyl methacrylate (MMA), and to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
