Flufenamic acid (FFA) is a member of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).: 718   Like other members of the class, it is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, preventing the formation of prostaglandins. FFA is known to bind to and reduce the activity of prostaglandin F synthase and activate TRPC6.
Scientists led by Claude Winder from Parke-Davis invented FFA in 1963, along with fellow members of the class, mefenamic acid in 1961 and meclofenamic acid in 1964.: 718 
Although flufenamic acid was at one time informally referred to as "Fluffy" (see history cache), this pet name could also refer to flufenoxine.
