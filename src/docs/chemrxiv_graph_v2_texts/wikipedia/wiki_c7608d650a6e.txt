Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and a phenolic compound. It is an organic compound with the formula (CH3O)HOC6H3CH=CHCO2H.  The name is derived from the genus Ferula, referring to the giant fennel (Ferula communis). Classified as a phenolic phytochemical, ferulic acid is an amber colored solid.  Esters of ferulic acid are found in plant cell walls, covalently bonded to hemicellulose such as arabinoxylans.  Salts and esters derived from ferulic acid are called ferulates.
