Syringol is the organic compound with the formula HO(CH3O)2C6H3.  The molecule is a phenol, with methoxy groups in the flanking (2 and 6) positions.  It is the symmetrically dimethylated derivative of pyrogallol.  It is a colorless solid, although typical samples are brown owing to air-oxidized impurities. Together with guaiacol, syringol and its derivatives are produced by the pyrolysis of lignin. Specifically, syringol is derived from the thermal decomposition of the sinapyl alcohol component. As such, syringol is an important component of wood smoke.
