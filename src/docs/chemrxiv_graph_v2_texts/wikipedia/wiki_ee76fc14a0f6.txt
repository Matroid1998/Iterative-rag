Propylene glycol (IUPAC name: propane-1,2-diol) is a viscous, colorless liquid. It is almost odorless and has a faintly sweet taste. Its chemical formula is CH3CH(OH)CH2OH. 
As it contains two alcohol groups, it is classified as a diol. An aliphatic diol may also be called a glycol. It is miscible with a broad range of solvents, including water, acetone, and chloroform. In general, glycols are non-irritating and have very low volatility.
For certain uses as a food additive, propylene glycol is considered as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration, and is approved for food manufacturing. In the European Union, it has E-number E1520 for food applications. For cosmetics and pharmacology, the number is E490. Propylene glycol is also present in propylene glycol alginate, which is known as E405.
Propylene glycol is approved and used as a vehicle for topical, oral, and some intravenous pharmaceutical preparations in the US and Europe.
