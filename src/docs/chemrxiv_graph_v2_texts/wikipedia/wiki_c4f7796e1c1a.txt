Plasmalogens are a class of glycerophospholipid with a plasmenyl group linked to a lipid at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone. Plasmalogens are found in multiple domains of life, including mammals, invertebrates, protozoa, and anaerobic bacteria. They are commonly found in cell membranes in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. In humans, lower levels of plasmalogens are studied in relation to some diseases. Plasmalogens are also associated with adaptations to extreme environments in non-human organisms.
