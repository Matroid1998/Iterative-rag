In biochemistry, an esterase is a class of enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis (and as such, it is a type of hydrolase).
A wide range of different esterases exist that differ in their substrate specificity, their protein structure, and their biological function.
