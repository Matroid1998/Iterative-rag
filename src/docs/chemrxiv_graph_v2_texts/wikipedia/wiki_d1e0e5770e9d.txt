The sulphide minerals are a class of minerals containing sulphide (S2−) or disulphide (S2−2) as the major anion. Some sulfide minerals are economically important as metal ores. The sulphide class also includes the selenides, the tellurides, the arsenides, the antimonides, the bismuthinides, the sulpharsenides and the sulphosalts.  Sulphide minerals are inorganic compounds.
