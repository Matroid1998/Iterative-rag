The Scholl reaction is a coupling reaction between two arene compounds with the aid of a Lewis acid and a protic acid. It is named after its discoverer, Roland Scholl, a Swiss chemist.

In 1910 Scholl reported the synthesis of a quinone  and of perylene from naphthalene both with aluminum chloride. Perylene was also synthesised from 1,1â€™-binaphthalene in 1913. The synthesis of Benzanthrone was reported in 1912.
The protic acid in the Scholl reaction is often an impurity in the Lewis Acid and also formed in the course of a Scholl reaction. Reagents are iron(III) chloride in dichloromethane, copper(II) chloride, PIFA and boron trifluoride etherate in dichloromethane, Molybdenum(V) chloride and lead tetraacetate with BF3 in acetonitrile.
Given the high reaction temperature and the requirement for strongly acidic catalysts the chemical yield often is low and the method is not a popular one. Intramolecular reactions fare better than the intermolecular ones, for instance in the organic synthesis of 9-phenylfluorene:

Or the formation of the pyrene dibenzo-(a.1)-pyrene from the anthracene 1-phenylbenz(a)anthracene (66% yield).

One study showed that the reaction lends itself to cascade reactions to form more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
In certain applications such as triphenylene synthesis this reaction is advocated as an alternative for the Suzuki reaction. A recurring problem is oligomerization of the product which can be prevented by blocking tert-butyl substituents:
