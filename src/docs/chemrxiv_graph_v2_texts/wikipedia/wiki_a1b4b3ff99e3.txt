In organosilicon chemistry, silanes are a diverse class of charge-neutral organic compounds with the general formula SiR4.  The R substituents can be any combination of organic  or inorganic groups.  Most silanes contain Si-C bonds, and are discussed under organosilicon compounds.  Some contain Si-H bonds and are discussed under hydrosilanes.
