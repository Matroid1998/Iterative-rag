Vorinostat (rINN), also known as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  (suberoyl+anilide+hydroxamic acid abbreviated as SAHA), is a member of a larger class of compounds that inhibit histone deacetylases (HDAC).  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) have a broad spectrum of epigenetic activities.
Vorinostat is marketed under the name Zolinza ( zoh-LIN-z…ô) by Merck for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after two systemic therapies. The compound was developed by Columbia University chemist Ronald Breslow and Memorial Sloan-Kettering researcher Paul Marks.
