Trogtalite is a rare selenide mineral with the formula CoSe2. It crystallizes in the cubic system and is part of the pyrite group, consisting of Co2+ and Se22− ions. It has a rose-violet colour and its crystals are opaque. It often occurs as grains. It was thought to be dimorphous with hastite, but this was discredited in 2009. Hastite turned out to be the iron selenide mineral ferroselite. It forms a solid solution series with kruťaite.
