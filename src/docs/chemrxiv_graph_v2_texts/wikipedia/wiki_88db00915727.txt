Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a family of carbon nitride compounds with a general formula near to C3N4 (albeit typically with non-zero amounts of hydrogen) and two major substructures based on heptazine and poly(triazine imide) units which, depending on reaction conditions, exhibit different degrees of condensation, properties and reactivities.
