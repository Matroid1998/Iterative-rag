Methylidenecarbene (systematically named λ2-ethene and dihydrido-1κ2H-dicarbon(C—C)) is an organic compound with the chemical formula C=CH2 (also written [CCH2] or C2H2). It is a metastable proton tautomer of acetylene, which only persists as an adduct. It is a colourless gas that phosphoresces in the far-infrared range. It is the simplest unsaturated carbene.
