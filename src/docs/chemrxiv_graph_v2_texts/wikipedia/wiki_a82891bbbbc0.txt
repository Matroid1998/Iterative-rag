In electrochemistry, the standard hydrogen electrode (abbreviated SHE), is a redox electrode which forms the basis of the thermodynamic scale of oxidation-reduction potentials. Its absolute electrode potential is estimated to be 4.44 ± 0.02 V at 25 °C, but to form a basis for comparison with all other electrochemical reactions, hydrogen's standard electrode potential (E°) is declared to be zero volts at any temperature. Potentials of all other electrodes are compared with that of the standard hydrogen electrode at the same temperature.
