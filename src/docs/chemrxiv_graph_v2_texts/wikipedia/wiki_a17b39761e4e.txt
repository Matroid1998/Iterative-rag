Deuterated methanol (CD3OD), is a form (called an isotopologue) of methanol (CH3OH) in which the hydrogen atoms ("H") are replaced with deuterium (heavy hydrogen) isotope ("D"). Deuterated methanol is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy.
Deuterated methanol was first detected in interstellar space was Orion-KL in 1988 by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.
