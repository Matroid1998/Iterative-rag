In organic chemistry, the acenes or polyacenes are a class of organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  made up of benzene (C6H6) rings which have been linearly fused. They follow the general molecular formula C4n+2H2n+4.
The larger representatives have potential interest in optoelectronic applications and are actively researched in chemistry and electrical engineering. Pentacene has been incorporated into organic field-effect transistors, reaching charge carrier mobilities as high as 5 cm2/Vs.
The first 5 unsubstituted members are listed in the following table:

Hexacene is not stable in air, and dimerises upon isolation. Heptacene (and larger acenes) is very reactive and has only been isolated in a matrix. However, bis(trialkylsilylethynylated) versions of heptacene have been isolated as crystalline solids.
