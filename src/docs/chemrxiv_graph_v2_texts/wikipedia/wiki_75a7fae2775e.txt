Polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs, are a class of organobromine compounds that are used as flame retardants. Like other brominated flame retardants, PBDEs have been used in a wide array of products, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motor vehicles, airplanes, plastics, polyurethane foams, and textiles.  They are structurally akin to polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other polyhalogenated compounds, consisting of two halogenated aromatic rings. PBDEs are classified according to the average number of bromine atoms in the molecule.  The life-saving benefits of fire retardants led to their popularization.  Standards for mass transit vehicles continues to increase as of 2021.: 1–26 
Because of their toxicity and persistence, all commercially relevant PBDEs have been marked for elimination under the Stockholm Convention, a treaty to control and phase out major persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
