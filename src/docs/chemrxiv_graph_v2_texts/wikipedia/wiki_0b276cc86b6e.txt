Ammonia solution, also known as ammonia water, ammonium hydroxide, ammoniacal liquor, ammonia liquor, aqua ammonia, aqueous ammonia, or (inaccurately) ammonia, is a solution of ammonia in water. It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq).  Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests a salt with the composition [NH+4][OH−], it is impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH+4 and OH− do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions.
The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the Baumé scale (density), with 26 degrees Baumé (about 30% of ammonia by weight at 15.5 °C or 59.9 °F) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.
