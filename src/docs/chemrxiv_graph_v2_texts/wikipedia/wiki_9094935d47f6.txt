Tropinone is an alkaloid, famously synthesised in 1917 by Robert Robinson as a synthetic  precursor to atropine, a scarce commodity during World War I. Tropinone and the alkaloids cocaine and atropine all share the same tropane core structure. Its corresponding conjugate acid at pH 7.3 major species is known as tropiniumone.
