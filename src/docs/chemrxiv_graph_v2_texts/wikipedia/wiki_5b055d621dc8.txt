An ion-selective electrode (ISE), also known as a  specific ion electrode (SIE), is a simple membrane-based potentiometric device which measures the activity of ions in solution. It is a transducer (or sensor) that converts the change in the concentration of a specific ion dissolved in a solution into an electrical potential. ISE is a type of sensor device that senses changes in signal based on the surrounding environment through time. This device will have an input signal, a property that we wish to quantify, and an output signal, a quantity we can register. In this case, ion selective electrode are electrochemical sensors that give potentiometric signals. The voltage is theoretically dependent on the logarithm of the ionic activity, according to the Nernst equation. Analysis with ISEs expands throughout a range of technological fields such as biology, chemistry, environmental science and other industrial workplaces like agriculture. Ion-selective electrodes are used in analytical chemistry and  biochemical/biophysical research, where measurements of ionic concentration in an aqueous solution are required.
