In organic chemistry, phenols, sometimes called phenolics, are a class of chemical compounds consisting of one or more hydroxyl groups (âˆ’O H) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group. The simplest is phenol, C6H5OH. Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule.

Phenols are both synthesized industrially and produced by plants and microorganisms.
