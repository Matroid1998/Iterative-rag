Phenobarbital, also known as phenobarbitone or phenobarb, sold under the brand name Luminal among others, is a medication of the barbiturate type. It is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy in developing countries. In the developed world, it is commonly used to treat seizures in young children, while other medications are generally used in older children and adults. It is also used for veterinary purposes.
It may be administered by slow intravenous infusion (IV infusion), intramuscularly (IM), or orally (swallowed by mouth). Subcutaneous administration is not recommended. The IV or IM (injectable forms) may be used to treat status epilepticus if other drugs fail to achieve satisfactory results. Phenobarbital is occasionally used to treat insomnia, anxiety, and benzodiazepine withdrawal (as well as withdrawal from certain other drugs in specific circumstances), and prior to surgery as an anxiolytic and to induce sedation. It usually begins working within five minutes when used intravenously and half an hour when administered orally. Its effects last for between four hours and two days.
Potentially serious side effects include a decreased level of consciousness and respiratory depressant. There is potential for both abuse and withdrawal following long-term use. It may also increase the risk of suicide.
It is pregnancy category D in Australia, meaning that it may cause harm when taken during pregnancy. If used during breastfeeding it may result in drowsiness in the baby. Phenobarbital works by increasing the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
Phenobarbital was discovered in 1912 and is the oldest still commonly used anti-seizure medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
