The triphenylmethyl radical (often shortened to trityl radical after 1927 suggestion by Helferich et al.) is an organic compound with the formula (C6H5)3C. It is a persistent radical. It was the first radical ever to be described in organic chemistry.  Because of its accessibility, the trityl radical has been heavily exploited.
