The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a biological system composed of endocannabinoids, which are neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the central nervous system (including the brain) and peripheral nervous system. The endocannabinoid system is still not fully understood, but may be involved in regulating physiological and cognitive processes, including fertility, pregnancy, pre- and postnatal development, various activity of immune system, appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the pharmacological effects of cannabis. The ECS plays an important role in multiple aspects of neural functions, including the control of movement and motor coordination, learning and memory, emotion and motivation, addictive-like behavior and pain modulation, among others.
Two primary cannabinoid receptors have been identified: CB1, first cloned (or isolated) in 1990; and CB2, cloned in 1993. CB1 receptors are found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the fatty-acid neurotransmitter anandamide, as well as the most known active component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Another endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), also interacts with both CB receptors. It is significantly more abundant in the mammalian brain than anandamide, exceeding it by two to three orders of magnitude. 
The endocannabinoid system is sometimes called the endocannabinoidome or the expanded endocannabinoid system, as it includes a broader range of lipid mediators, receptors, and enzymes beyond CB1 and CB2.
