In enzymology, a manganese peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.13) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 Mn(II) + 2 H+ + H2O2

 2 Mn(III) + 2 H2O
The 3 substrates of this enzyme are Mn(II), H+, and H2O2, whereas its two products are Mn(III) and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases).  The systematic name of this enzyme class is Mn(II):hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include peroxidase-M2, and Mn-dependent (NADH-oxidizing) peroxidase.  It employs one cofactor, heme.  This enzyme needs Ca2+ for activity.
White rot fungi secrete this enzyme to aid lignin degradation.
