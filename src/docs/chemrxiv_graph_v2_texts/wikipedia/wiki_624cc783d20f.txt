Transamidation is a chemical reaction in which an amide reacts with an amine to generate a new amide:

RC(O)NR'2  +  HNR"2  â†’   RC(O)NR"2  +  HNR'2
The reaction is typically very slow, but it can be accelerated with Lewis acid and organometallic catalysts.  Primary amides (RC(O)NH2) are more amenable to this reaction.
