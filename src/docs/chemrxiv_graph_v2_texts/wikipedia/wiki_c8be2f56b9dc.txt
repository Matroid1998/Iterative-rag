The lysophospholipid receptor (LPL-R) group are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family of  integral membrane proteins that are important for lipid signaling.  In humans, there are eleven LPL receptors, each encoded by a separate gene.  These LPL receptor genes are also sometimes referred to as "Edg" (an acronym for endothelial differentiation gene).
