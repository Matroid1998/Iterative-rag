Istradefylline, sold under the brand name Nourianz, is a medication used as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in adults with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing "off" episodes. Istradefylline reduces "off" periods resulting from long-term treatment with the antiparkinson drug levodopa. An "off" episode is a time when a patient's medications are not working well, causing an increase in PD symptoms, such as tremor and difficulty walking.
Relatively common side effects include involuntary muscle movements (dyskinesia), constipation, hallucinations, dizziness and, much like its parent molecule caffeine, nausea and sleeplessness.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.
