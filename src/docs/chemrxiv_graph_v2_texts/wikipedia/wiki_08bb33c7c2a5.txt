2,2′-Bithiophene is the organic compound.   It is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are often greenish. It is the most common of the three isomers with formula (C4H3S)2. The other two isomers have the connectivity 2,3′- and 3,3′-.  The compound is typically prepared by cross-coupling starting from 2-halothiophenes.
X-ray crystallography shows that the two rings are coplanar, unlike the situation for biphenyl.
