In organic chemistry, aziridines are organic compounds containing the aziridine functional group (chemical structure (R−)4C2N−R), a three-membered heterocycle with one amine (>NR) and two methylene bridges (>CR2).  The parent compound is aziridine (or ethylene imine), with molecular formula C2H4NH. Several drugs feature aziridine rings, including mitomycin C, porfiromycin, and azinomycin B (carzinophilin).
