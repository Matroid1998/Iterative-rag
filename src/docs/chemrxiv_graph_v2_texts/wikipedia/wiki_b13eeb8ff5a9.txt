Calcium silicate can refer to several silicates of calcium including:

2CaO路SiO2, larnite (Ca2SiO4)
3CaO路SiO2, alite or (Ca3SiO5)
3CaO路2SiO2, (Ca3Si2O7)
CaO路SiO2, wollastonite (CaSiO3).
This article focuses on Ca2SiO4, also known as calcium orthosilicate. It is also referred to by the shortened trade name Cal-Sil or Calsil.  All calcium silicates are white free-flowing powders. They are components of important structural materials because they are strong, cheap, and nontoxic.
