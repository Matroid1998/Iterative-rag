Psilocin, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-OH-DMT), is a substituted tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic psychedelic. It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocybin, as well as synthetic esters such as 4-AcO-DMT (psilacetin; O-acetylpsilocin) and 4-PrO-DMT (O-propionylpsilocin), are prodrugs of psilocin.
Acting on the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, psilocin's psychedelic effects are directly correlated with the drug's occupancy at these receptor sites. The subjective mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and are said to resemble those of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).
Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
