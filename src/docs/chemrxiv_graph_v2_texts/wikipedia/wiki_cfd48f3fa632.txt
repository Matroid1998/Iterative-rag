"Traitor to the Motherland family members" (Russian: ЧСИР: члены семьи изменника Родины, romanized: ChSIR: chleny sem'i izmennika Rodiny, lit. 'members of the family of a traitor of the Motherland') was a term in Article 58 of the Criminal Code of Russian SFSR (as amended on 8 June 1934 from the original wording of 1927). The amended Article dealt with the criminal prosecution of wives and children (kin punishment) of all people who were arrested and convicted as "traitors of the Motherland" in the Soviet Union during Stalinist purges of the 1930s and later.
