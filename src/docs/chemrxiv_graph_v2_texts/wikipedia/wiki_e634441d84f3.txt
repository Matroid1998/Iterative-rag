Germanium telluride (GeTe) is a chemical compound of germanium and tellurium and is a component of chalcogenide glass. It shows semimetallic conduction and ferroelectric behaviour.
Germanium telluride exists in three major crystalline forms, room-temperature α (rhombohedral) and γ (orthorhombic) structures and high-temperature β (cubic, rocksalt-type) phase; α phase being most phase for pure GeTe below the ferroelectric Curie temperature of approximately 670 K (746 °F; 397 °C).
Doped germanium telluride is a low temperature superconductor.
