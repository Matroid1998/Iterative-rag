Janus kinase 2 (commonly called JAK2) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. It is a member of the Janus kinase family and has been implicated in signaling by members of the type II cytokine receptor family (e.g. interferon receptors), the GM-CSF receptor family (IL-3R, IL-5R and GM-CSF-R), the gp130 receptor family (e.g., IL-6R), and the single chain receptors (e.g. Epo-R, Tpo-R, GH-R, PRL-R).
The distinguishing feature between janus kinase 2 and other JAK kinases is the lack of Src homology binding domains (SH2/SH3) and the presence of up to seven JAK homology domains (JH1-JH7). Nonetheless the terminal JH domains retain a high level of homology to tyrosine kinase domains.  An interesting note is that only one of these carboxy-terminal JH domains retains full kinase function (JH1) while the other (JH2), previously thought to have no kinase functionality and accordingly termed a pseudokinase domain, has since been found to be catalytically active, albeit at only 10% that of the JH1 domain.
Loss of JAK2 is lethal by embryonic day 12 in mice.
JAK2 orthologs have been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available.
