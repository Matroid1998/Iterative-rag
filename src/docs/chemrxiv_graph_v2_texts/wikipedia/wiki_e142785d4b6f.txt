Perfluoroethers are a class of organofluorine compound containing one or more ether functional group.  In general these compounds are structurally analogous to the related hydrocarbon ethers, except for the distinctive properties of fluorocarbons.
The introduction of an ether function to a perfluoro-polymer chain also provides thermoplastic properties to the polymer, making thermal forming possible. This is a great technological advantage for producing a large variety of shapes (e.g., beakers, funnels, flasks for laboratory uses, etc...) and allows extrusion of highly chemically-resistant tubing. It also confers on the polymer a translucent appearance.
