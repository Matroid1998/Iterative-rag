Sodium cobalt oxide, also called sodium cobaltate, is any of a range of compounds of sodium, cobalt, and oxygen with the general formula NaxCoO2 for 0 < x ≤ 1.  The name is also used for hydrated forms of those compounds, NaxCoO2·yH2O.
The anhydrous compound was first synthesized in the 1970s.  It conducts like a metal, and has exceptional thermoelectric properties (for 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) combining a large Seebeck coefficient with low resistivity, as discovered in 1997 by Ichiro Terasaki's research group.  A hydrate form was found to be superconducting below 5 K.  The compound, and its manganese analog, could be a cheaper alternative to the analogous lithium compounds.
