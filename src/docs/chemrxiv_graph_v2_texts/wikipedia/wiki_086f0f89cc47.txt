Bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19. The medication was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020, and the EUA was revoked in April 2021.
Bamlanivimab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19.
Bamlanivimab emerged from the collaboration between Lilly and AbCellera to create antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Bamlanivimab is also used as part of the bamlanivimab/etesevimab combination that was granted an EUA by the FDA.
In June 2021, the US Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) paused distribution of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, and etesevimab alone (to pair with existing supply of bamlanivimab), due to the increase of circulating variants.
