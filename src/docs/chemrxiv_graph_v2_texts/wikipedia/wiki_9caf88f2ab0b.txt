Chlorhexidine is a disinfectant and antiseptic with the molecular formula C22H30Cl2N10, which is used for skin disinfection before surgery and to disinfect surgical instruments. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, treating yeast infections of the mouth, and to keep urinary catheters from blocking. It is used as a liquid or a powder. It is commonly used in salt form, either the gluconate or the acetate.
Side effects may include skin irritation, tooth discoloration, and allergic reactions, although, apart from discoloration, the risk appears to be the same as that for povidone-iodine. Chlorhexidine rinse is also known to have a bitter metallic aftertaste. Rinsing with water is not recommended as it is known to increase the bitterness. It may cause eye problems if direct contact occurs. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Chlorhexidine may come mixed in alcohol, water, or surfactant solution. It is effective against a range of microorganisms, but does not inactivate spores.
Chlorhexidine came into medical use in the 1950s and is  available over the counter in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 230th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.
