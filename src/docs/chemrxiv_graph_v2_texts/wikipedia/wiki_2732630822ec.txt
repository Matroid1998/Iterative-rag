In polymer chemistry, radical polymerization (RP) is a method of polymerization by which a polymer forms by the successive addition of a radical to building blocks (repeat units). Radicals can be formed by a number of different mechanisms, usually involving separate initiator molecules. Following its generation, the initiating radical adds (nonradical) monomer units, thereby growing the polymer chain.
Radical polymerization is a key synthesis route for obtaining a wide variety of different polymers and materials composites. The relatively non-specific nature of radical chemical interactions makes this one of the most versatile forms of polymerization available and allows facile reactions of polymeric radical chain ends and other chemicals or substrates. In 2001, 40 billion of the 110 billion pounds of polymers produced in the United States were produced by radical polymerization.

Radical polymerization is a type of chain polymerization, along with anionic, cationic and coordination polymerization.
