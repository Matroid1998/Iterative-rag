Diamantane (also called congressane) is an organic compound that is a member of the diamondoids.  These are cage hydrocarbons with structures similar to a subunit of the diamond lattice.  It is a colorless solid that has been a topic of research since its discovery in oil and separation from deep natural gas condensates. Diamondoids such as diamantane exhibit unusual properties, including low surface energies, high densities, high hydrophobicities, and resistance to oxidation.
