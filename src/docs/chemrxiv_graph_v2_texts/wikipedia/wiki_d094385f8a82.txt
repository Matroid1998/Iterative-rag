An iron oxide is a chemical compound composed of iron and oxygen. Several iron oxides are recognized.  Often they are non-stoichiometric. Ferric oxyhydroxides are a related class of compounds, perhaps the best known of which is rust.
Iron oxides and oxyhydroxides are widespread in nature and play an important role in many geological and biological processes.  They are used as iron ores, pigments, catalysts, and in thermite, and occur in hemoglobin. Iron oxides are inexpensive and durable pigments in paints, coatings and colored concretes. Colors commonly available are in the "earthy" end of the yellow/orange/red/brown/black range. When used as a food coloring, it has E number E172.
