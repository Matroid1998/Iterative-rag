Pyrometallurgy is a branch of extractive metallurgy.  It consists of the thermal treatment of minerals and metallurgical ores and concentrates to bring about physical and chemical transformations in the materials to enable recovery of valuable metals.  Pyrometallurgical treatment may produce products able to be sold such as pure metals, or intermediate compounds or alloys, suitable as feed for further processing.  Examples of elements extracted by pyrometallurgical processes include the oxides of less reactive elements like iron, copper, zinc, chromium, tin, and manganese.
Pyrometallurgical processes are generally grouped into one or more of the following categories:

calcining,
roasting,
smelting,
refining.
Most pyrometallurgical processes require energy input to sustain the temperature at which the process takes place.  The energy is usually provided in the form of combustion or from electrical heat.  When sufficient material is present in the feed to sustain the process temperature solely by exothermic reaction (i.e. without the addition of fuel or electrical heat), the process is said to be "autogenous".  Processing of some sulfide ores exploit the exothermicity of their combustion.
