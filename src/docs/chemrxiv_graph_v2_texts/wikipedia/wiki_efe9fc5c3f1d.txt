In organic chemistry, a peptide bond is an amide type of covalent chemical bond linking two consecutive alpha-amino acids from C1 (carbon number one) of one alpha-amino acid and N2 (nitrogen number two) of another, along a peptide or protein chain.
It can also be called a eupeptide bond to distinguish it from an isopeptide bond, which is another type of amide bond between two amino acids.
