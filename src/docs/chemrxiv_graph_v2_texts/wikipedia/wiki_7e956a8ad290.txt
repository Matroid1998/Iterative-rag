Pillararenes are macrocycles composed of hydroquinone or dialkoxybenzene units (5 to 10) linked in the para position by methylene bridges. They are structurally similar to the cucurbiturils and calixarenes that play an important part in hostâ€“guest chemistry. The first pillararene was the five membered dimethoxypillar[5]arene.
