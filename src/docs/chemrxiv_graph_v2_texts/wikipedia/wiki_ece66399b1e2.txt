In inorganic chemistry, chlorosilanes are a group of reactive, chlorine-containing chemical compounds, related to silane (SiH4) and used in many chemical processes. Each such chemical has at least one silicon-chlorine (Siâˆ’Cl) bond. Trichlorosilane is produced on the largest scale. The parent chlorosilane is silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4).
