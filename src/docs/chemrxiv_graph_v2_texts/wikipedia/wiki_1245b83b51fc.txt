The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, also known as CO2RR, is the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to more reduced chemical species using electrical energy. It represents one potential step in the broad scheme of carbon capture and utilization.
CO2RR can produce diverse compounds including formate (HCOOâˆ’), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), and ethanol (C2H5OH). The main challenges are the relatively high cost of electricity (vs petroleum) and that CO2 is often contaminated with O2 and must be purified before reduction.
The first examples of CO2RR are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to carbon monoxide using a zinc cathode. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the oil embargoes of the 1970s. As of 2021, pilot-scale carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction is being developed by several companies, including Siemens, Dioxide Materials, Twelve, GIGKarasek, and OCOchem. The techno-economic analysis was recently conducted to assess the key technical gaps and commercial potentials of the carbon dioxide electrolysis technology at near ambient conditions.
CO2RR electrolyzers have been developed to reduce other forms of CO2 including [bi]carbonates sourced from CO2 captured directly from the air using strong alkalis like KOH  or carbamates sourced from flue gas effluents using alkali or amine-based absorbents like MEA or DEA. While the techno-economics of these systems are not yet feasible, they provide a near net carbon neutral pathway to produce commodity chemicals like ethylene at industrially relavant scales.
