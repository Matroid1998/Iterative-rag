Aripiprazole, sold under the brand name Abilify, among others, is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder; other uses include as an add-on treatment for major depressive disorder and tic disorders. Aripiprazole is taken by mouth or via injection into a muscle. A Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of effectiveness in treating schizophrenia.
Common side effects include restlessness, insomnia, transient weight gain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, and mild sedation. Serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, and anaphylaxis. It is not recommended for older people with dementia-related psychosis due to an increased risk of death. In pregnancy, there is evidence of possible harm to the fetus. It is not recommended in women who are breastfeeding. It has not been very well studied in people less than 18 years old.
Aripiprazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 106th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
