Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), also known as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and FGF-Î², is a growth factor and signaling protein encoded by the FGF2 gene. It binds to and exerts effects via specific fibroblast growth factor receptor  (FGFR) proteins, themselves a family of closely related molecules. Fibroblast growth factor protein was first purified in 1975; soon thereafter three variants were isolated: 'basic FGF' (FGF2); Heparin-binding growth factor-2; and Endothelial cell growth factor-2. Gene sequencing revealed that this group is the same FGF2 protein and is a member of a family of FGF proteins.
