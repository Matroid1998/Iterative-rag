Hydrazides in organic chemistry are a class of organic compounds with the formula R−NR1−NR2R3 where R is acyl (R'−C(=O)−), sulfonyl (R'−S(=O)2−), phosphoryl ((R'−)2P(=O)−), phosphonyl ((R'−O−)2P(=O)−) and similar groups (chalcogen analogs are included, for example sulfur analogs called thiohydrazides), R1, R2, R3 and R' are any groups (typically hydrogen or organyl). Unlike hydrazine and alkylhydrazines, hydrazides are nonbasic owing to the inductive influence of the acyl, sulfonyl, or phosphoryl substituent.
