Lanthanum manganite is an inorganic compound with the formula LaMnO3, often abbreviated as LMO. Lanthanum manganite is formed in the perovskite structure, consisting of oxygen octahedra with a central Mn atom. The cubic perovskite structure is distorted into an orthorhombic structure by a strong Jahn–Teller distortion of the oxygen octahedra.
LaMnO3 often has lanthanum vacancies as evidenced by neutron scattering. For this reason, this material is usually referred as LaMnO3+ẟ. These vacancies generate a structure with a rhombohedral unit cell in this perovskite. A temperatures below 140 K, this LaMnO3+ẟ semiconductor exhibit a ferromagnetic order.
