Methanesulfonic acid (MsOH, MSA) or methanesulphonic acid (in British English) is an organosulfuric, colorless liquid with the molecular formula CH3SO3H and structure H3C−S(=O)2−OH. It is the simplest of the alkylsulfonic acids (R−S(=O)2−OH). Salts and esters of methanesulfonic acid are known as mesylates (or methanesulfonates, as in ethyl methanesulfonate). It is hygroscopic in its concentrated form. Methanesulfonic acid can dissolve a wide range of metal salts, many of them in significantly higher concentrations than in hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
