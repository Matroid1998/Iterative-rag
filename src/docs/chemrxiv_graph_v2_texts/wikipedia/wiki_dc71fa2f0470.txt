Polyzoniida is an order of millipedes in the subterclass Colobognatha. This order contains three families and more than 70 described species. The species in this order are also known as camphor millipedes, because ozopore secretions in this order frequently have a strong camphor-like smell. Poison frogs in South America and Madagascar evidently obtain some of their poison from these millipedes.
