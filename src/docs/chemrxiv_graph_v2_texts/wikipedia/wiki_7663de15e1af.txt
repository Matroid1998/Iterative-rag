Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) are organic compounds that can absorb and release hydrogen through chemical reactions. LOHCs can therefore be used as storage media for hydrogen. In principle, every unsaturated compound (organic molecules with C-C double or triple bonds) can take up hydrogen during hydrogenation. The sequence of endothermal dehydrogenation followed by hydrogen purification is considered as the main drawback which limits the overall efficiency of the storage cycle. LOHC shipping without heat recycling has an energy efficiency of 60-70%, depending on the dehydrogenation rate, which is equivalent to liquid hydrogen shipping. With heat recycling, the energy efficiency increase to 80-90%. 
In 2020, Japan built up the world's first international hydrogen supply chain between Brunei and Kawasaki City utilizing toluene-based LOHC technology. Hyundai Motor invests in the development for stationary and on-board LOHC-systems.
