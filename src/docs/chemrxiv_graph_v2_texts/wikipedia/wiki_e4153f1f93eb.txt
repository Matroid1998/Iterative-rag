Hydroxylamine (also known as hydroxyammonia) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula NH2OH. The compound exists as hygroscopic colorless crystals. Hydroxylamine is almost always provided and used as an aqueous solution or more often as one of its salts such as hydroxylammonium sulfate, a water-soluble solid.
Hydroxylamine and its salts are consumed almost exclusively to produce Nylon-6. The oxidation of NH3 to hydroxylamine is a step in biological nitrification.
