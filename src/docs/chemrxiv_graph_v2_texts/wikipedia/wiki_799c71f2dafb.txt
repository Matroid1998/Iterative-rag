In organic chemistry, a dithiol is a type of organosulfur compound with two thiol (âˆ’SH) functional groups. Their properties are generally similar to those of monothiols in terms of solubility, odor, and volatility.  They can be classified according to the relative location of the two thiol groups on the organic backbone.
