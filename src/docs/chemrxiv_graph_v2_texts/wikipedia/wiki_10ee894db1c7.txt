In organic chemistry, an ethyl group (abbr. Et) is an alkyl substituent with the formula  âˆ’CH2CH3, derived from ethane (C2H6).  Ethyl is used in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's nomenclature of organic chemistry for a saturated two-carbon moiety in a molecule, while the prefix "eth-" is used to indicate the presence of two carbon atoms in the molecule.
