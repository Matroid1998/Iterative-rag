Caesium dibismuthide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula CsBi2. It can obtained by reacting bismuth and caesium at 650 Â°C and allowing it to cool down, obtaining light silver crystals. The crystals belong to the cubic Fd3m space group, and have a Cu2Mg structure. Some sources point out that it is not sensitive to air and is slightly sensitive to moisture. However, other sources also mention that it decomposes and releases heat after being left in the air for a few minutes.
