Prednisolone is a corticosteroid, a steroid hormone used to treat certain types of allergies, inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and cancers, electrolyte imbalances and skin conditions. Some of these conditions include adrenocortical insufficiency, high blood calcium, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, eye inflammation, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and phimosis. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a vein, used topically as a skin cream, or as eye drops. It differs from the similarly named prednisone in having a hydroxyl at the 11th carbon instead of a ketone.
Common side effects with short-term use include nausea, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, increased appetite, and fatigue. More severe side effects include psychiatric problems, which may occur in about 5% of people. Common side effects with long-term use include bone loss, weakness, yeast infections, and easy bruising. While short-term use in the later part of pregnancy is safe, long-term use or use in early pregnancy is occasionally associated with harm to the baby. It is a glucocorticoid made from hydrocortisone (cortisol).
Prednisolone was discovered and approved for medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug. In 2022, it was the 136th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions.
