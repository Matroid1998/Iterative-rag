Diiminopyridines (DIP, also known a pyridine diimines, PDIs) are a class of diimine ligands.  They featuring a pyridine nucleus with imine sidearms appended to the 2,6â€“positions.  The three nitrogen centres bind metals in a tridentate fashion, forming pincer complexes. Diiminopyridines are notable as non-innocent ligand that can assume more than one oxidation state. Complexes of DIPs participate in a range of chemical reactions, including ethylene polymerization, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation.
