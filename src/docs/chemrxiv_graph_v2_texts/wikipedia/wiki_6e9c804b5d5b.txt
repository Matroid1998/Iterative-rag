In chemistry, hydroxylation refers to the installation of a hydroxyl group (âˆ’OH) into an organic compound.  Hydroxylations generate alcohols and phenols, which are very common functional groups.  Hydroxylation confers some degree of water-solubility.  Hydroxylation of a hydrocarbon is an oxidation, thus a step in degradation.
