The polyiodides are a class of polyhalogen anions composed entirely of iodine atoms. The most common member is the triiodide ion, I−3. Other known larger polyiodides include [I4]2−, [I5]−, [I6]2−, [I7]−, [I8]2−, [I9]−, [I10]2−, [I10]4−, [I11]3−, [I12]2−, [I13]3−, [I14]4-, [I16]2−, [I22]4−, [I26]3−, [I26]4−, [I28]4− and [I29]3−. All these can be considered as formed from the interaction of the I–, I2, and I−3 building blocks.
