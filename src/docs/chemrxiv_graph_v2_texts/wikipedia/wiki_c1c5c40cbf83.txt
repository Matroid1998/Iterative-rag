PH2, also known as Kepler-86, or KIC 12735740 (2MASS J19190326+5157453), is a G-type star 1,120 light-years (340 parsecs) distant within the constellation Cygnus. Roughly the size and temperature of the Sun, PH2 gained prominence when it was known to be the host of one of 42 planet candidates detected by the Planet Hunters citizen science project in its second data release. The candidate orbiting around PH2, known as PH2b, had been determined to have a spurious detection probability of only 0.08%, thus effectively confirming its existence as a planet.
Located in its parent star's habitable zone, PH2b (or Kepler-86b) is a Jupiter-size gas giant which could in theory host a natural satellite suitable for hosting life. The report of the confirmed detection of PH2b was submitted on January 3, 2013. It was discovered by amateur Pole Rafa≈Ç Herszkowicz using his laptop and access to the Internet project with data from the Kepler space observatory.
