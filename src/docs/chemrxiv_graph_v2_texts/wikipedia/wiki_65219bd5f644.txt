Bismuth oxychloride is an inorganic compound of bismuth with the formula BiOCl. It is a lustrous white solid used since antiquity, notably in ancient Egypt. Light wave interference from its plate-like structure gives a pearly iridescent light reflectivity similar to nacre. Previously, until the last decade of the twentieth century, bismuth oxochloride was known as bismuthyl chloride. It is also known as pigment pearl white.
