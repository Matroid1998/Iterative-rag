In organic chemistry, the acetoxy group (abbr. AcO or OAc; IUPAC name: acetyloxy), is a functional group with the formula −OCOCH3 and the structure −O−C(=O)−CH3. As the -oxy suffix implies, it differs from the acetyl group (−C(=O)−CH3) by the presence of an additional oxygen atom. The name acetoxy is the short form of acetyl-oxy.
