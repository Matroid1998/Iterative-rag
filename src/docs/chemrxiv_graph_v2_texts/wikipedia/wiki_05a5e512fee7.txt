Styrene oxide is an epoxide derived from styrene.  It can be prepared by epoxidation of styrene with peroxybenzoic acid, in the Prilezhaev reaction:

Styrene oxide is slightly soluble in water. A trace amount of acid in water causes hydrolysis to racemic phenylethyleneglycol via a benzylic cation. If the amount of water is not sufficient, acid-catalyzed isomerization for phenylacetaldehyde will occur.
Styrene oxide in the body is metabolized to mandelic acid, phenylglyoxylic acid, benzoic acid and hippuric acid.
Hydrogenation of styrene oxide affords phenethyl alcohol.
