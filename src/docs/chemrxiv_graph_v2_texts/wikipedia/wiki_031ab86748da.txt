Iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Fe2O3. It occurs in nature as the mineral hematite, which serves as the primary source of iron for the steel industry. It is also known as red iron oxide, especially when used in pigments.
It is one of the three main oxides of iron, the other two being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare; and iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), which also occurs naturally as the mineral magnetite. 
Iron(III) oxide is often called rust, since rust shares several properties and has a similar composition; however, in chemistry, rust is considered an ill-defined material, described as hydrous ferric oxide.
Ferric oxide is readily attacked by even weak acids. It is a weak oxidising agent, most famously when reduced by aluminium in the thermite reaction.
