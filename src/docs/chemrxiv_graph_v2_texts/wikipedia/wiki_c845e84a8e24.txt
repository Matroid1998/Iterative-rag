Phthalaldehyde (sometimes also o-phthalaldehyde or ortho-phthalaldehyde, OPA) is the chemical compound with the formula C6H4(CHO)2. It is one of three isomers of benzene dicarbaldehyde, related to phthalic acid.  This pale yellow solid is a building block in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds and a reagent in the analysis of amino acids.  OPA dissolves in water solution at pH < 11.5. Its solutions degrade upon UV illumination and exposure to air.
