Lead(II) iodide (or lead iodide) is a chemical compound with the formula PbI2. At room temperature, it is a bright yellow odorless crystalline solid, that becomes orange and red when heated. It was formerly called plumbous iodide.
The compound currently has a few specialized applications, such as the manufacture of solar cells, X-rays and gamma-ray detectors. Its preparation is an entertaining and popular demonstration in chemistry education, to teach topics such as precipitation reactions and stoichiometry. It is decomposed by light at temperatures above 125 °C (257 °F), and this effect has been used in a patented photographic process.
Lead iodide was formerly employed as a yellow pigment in some paints, with the name iodide yellow. However, that use has been largely discontinued due to its toxicity and poor stability.
