Transition metal porphyrin complexes are a family of coordination complexes of the conjugate base of porphyrins.  Iron porphyrin complexes occur widely in nature, which has stimulated extensive studies on related synthetic complexes.  The metal-porphyrin interaction is a strong one such that metalloporphyrins are thermally robust.  They are catalysts and exhibit rich optical properties, although these complexes remain mainly of academic interest.
