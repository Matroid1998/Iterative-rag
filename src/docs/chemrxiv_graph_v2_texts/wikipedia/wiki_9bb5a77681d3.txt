Copper oxide is any of several binary compounds composed of the elements copper and oxygen.  Two oxides are well known, Cu2O and CuO, corresponding to the minerals cuprite and tenorite, respectively.  Paramelaconite (Cu4O3) is less well characterized.
Copper oxide may refer to:

Copper(I) oxide (cuprous oxide, Cu2O)
Copper(II) oxide (cupric oxide, CuO)
Copper peroxide (CuO2), a hypothetical compound
Paramelaconite (copper(I,II) oxide, Cu4O3)
Copper(III) oxide (Cu2O3) does not exist although Cu(III) is a component of cuprate superconductors
Copper(IV) oxide (CuO2) has been proposed to exist in the gas phase
