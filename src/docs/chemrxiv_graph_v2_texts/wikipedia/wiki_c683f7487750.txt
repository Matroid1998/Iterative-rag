Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (INN; trade name Synribo; formerly named as homoharringtonine or HHT) is a pharmaceutical drug substance that is indicated for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Omacetaxine approval in US is discontinued (August 2024)[1][2] and is no longer recommended for treatment of CML (as of NCCN CML guidance 3.2025) [3].
HHT is a natural plant alkaloid derived from Cephalotaxus fortunei. HHT and related compound esters of cephalotaxine were described first in 1970, and were the subject of intensive research efforts by Chinese investigators to clarify their role as anticancer and antileukemic agents from the 1970s until the present.  It was approved by the US FDA in October 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with CML with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
