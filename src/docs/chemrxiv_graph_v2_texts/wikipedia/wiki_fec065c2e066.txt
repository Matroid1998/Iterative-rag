Bis(pinacolato)diboron is a covalent compound containing two boron atoms and two pinacolato ligands. It has the formula [(CH3)4C2O2B]2; the pinacol groups are sometimes abbreviated as "pin", so the structure is sometimes represented as B2pin2. It is a colourless solid that is soluble in organic solvents.  It is a commercially available reagent for making pinacol boronic esters for organic synthesis. Unlike some other diboron compounds, B2pin2 is not moisture-sensitive and can be handled in air.
