Thiophenol is an organosulfur compound with the formula C6H5SH, sometimes abbreviated as PhSH.  This foul-smelling colorless liquid is the simplest aromatic thiol.  The chemical structures of thiophenol and its derivatives are analogous to phenols, where the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to the aromatic ring in phenol is replaced by a sulfur atom. The prefix thio- implies a sulfur-containing compound and when used before a root word name for a compound which would normally contain an oxygen atom, in the case of 'thiol' that the alcohol oxygen atom is replaced by a sulfur atom.
Thiophenols also describes a class of compounds formally derived from thiophenol itself.  All have a sulfhydryl group (-SH) covalently bonded to an aromatic ring.  The organosulfur ligand in the medicine thiomersal is a thiophenol.
