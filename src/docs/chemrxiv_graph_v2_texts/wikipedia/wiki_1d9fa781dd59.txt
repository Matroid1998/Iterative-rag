1,4,7-Triazacyclononane, known as "TACN" which is pronounced "tack-en," is an aza-crown ether with the formula (C2H4NH)3. TACN is derived, formally speaking, from cyclononane by replacing three equidistant CH2 groups with NH groups. TACN is one of the oligomers derived from aziridine, C2H4NH. Other members of the series include piperazine, C4H8(NH)2, and the cyclic tetramer 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane.
