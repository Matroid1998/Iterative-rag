Mitragynine is an indole-based alkaloid and is one of the main psychoactive constituents in the Southeast Asian plant Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as kratom. It is an atypical opioid that is typically consumed as a part of kratom for its pain-relieving and euphoric effects. It has also been researched for its use to potentially manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
Mitragynine is the most abundant active alkaloid in kratom. In Thai varieties of kratom, mitragynine is the most abundant component (up to 66% of total alkaloids), while 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) is a minor constituent (up to 2% of total alkaloid content). In Malaysian kratom varieties, mitragynine is present at lower concentration (12% of total alkaloids). Total alkaloid concentration in dried leaves ranges from 0.5 to 1.5%. Such preparations are orally consumed and typically involve dried kratom leaves which are brewed into tea or ground and placed into capsules.
