Silibinin (INN), also known as silybin (both from Silybum, the generic name of the plant from which it is extracted), is the major active constituent of silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk thistle, containing a mixture of flavonolignans consisting of silibinin, isosilibinin, silychristin, silidianin, and others.  Silibinin itself is a mixture of two diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B, in approximately equimolar ratio.  Silibinin is used in pure forms as a medication, and more frequently as an active ingredient in milk thistleâ€“derived herbal supplements.
