Parts cleaning is a step in various industrial processes, either as preparation for surface finishing or to safeguard delicate components. One such process, electroplating, is particularly sensitive to part cleanliness, as even thin layers of oil can hinder coating adhesion.
Cleaning methods encompass solvent cleaning, hot alkaline detergent cleaning, electro-cleaning, and acid etch. In industrial settings, the water-break test is a common practice to assess machinery cleanliness. This test involves thoroughly rinsing and vertically holding the surface. Hydrophobic contaminants, like oils, cause water to bead and break, leading to rapid drainage. In contrast, perfectly clean metal surfaces are hydrophilic and retain an unbroken sheet of water without beading or draining off. It is important to note that this test may not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but they can be displaced during the water-based electroplating process. Surfactants like soap can reduce the test's sensitivity and should be thoroughly rinsed off.
