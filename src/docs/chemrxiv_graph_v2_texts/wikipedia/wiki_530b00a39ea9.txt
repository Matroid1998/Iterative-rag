In organic chemistry, an aldol is a structure consisting of a hydroxy group (-OH) two carbons away from either an aldehyde or a ketone. The name combines the suffix 'ol' from the alcohol and the prefix depending on the carbonyl group, either 'ald' for an aldehyde, or 'ket' for a ketone, in which case it referred to as a 'ketol'. An aldol may also use the term β-hydroxy aldehyde (or β-hydroxy ketone for a ketol). The term "aldol" may refer to 3-hydroxybutanal.
Aldols are the product of a carbon-carbon bond-formation reaction, giving them wide applicability as a precursor for a variety of other compounds.
