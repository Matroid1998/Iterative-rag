Egyptian blue, also known as calcium copper silicate (CaCuSi4O10 or CaOCuO(SiO2)4 (calcium copper tetrasilicate)) or cuprorivaite, is a pigment that was used in ancient Egypt for thousands of years. It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment. It was known to the Romans by the name caeruleum. After the Roman era, Egyptian blue fell out of use and, thereafter, the manner of its creation was forgotten.  In modern times, scientists have been able to analyze its chemistry and reconstruct how to make it. 
The ancient Egyptian word wꜣḏ signifies blue, blue-green, and green.
The first recorded use of "Egyptian blue" as a color name in English was in 1809.
