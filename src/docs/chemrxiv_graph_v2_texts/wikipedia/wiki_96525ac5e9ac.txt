Organoiodine chemistry is the study of the synthesis and properties of organoiodine compounds, or organoiodides, organic compounds that contain one or more carbonâ€“iodine bonds.  They occur widely in organic chemistry, but are relatively rare in nature.  The thyroxine hormones are organoiodine compounds that are required for health and the reason for government-mandated iodization of salt.
