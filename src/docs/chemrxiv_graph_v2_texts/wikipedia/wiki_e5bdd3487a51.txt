Selenocysteine (symbol Sec or U, in older publications also as Se-Cys) is the 21st proteinogenic amino acid. Selenoproteins contain  selenocysteine residues. Selenocysteine is an analogue of the more common cysteine with selenium in place of the sulfur.
Selenocysteine is present in several enzymes (for example glutathione peroxidases, tetraiodothyronine 5â€² deiodinases, thioredoxin reductases, formate dehydrogenases, glycine reductases, selenophosphate synthetase 2, methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (SEPX1), and some hydrogenases). It occurs in all three domains of life, including important enzymes (listed above) present in humans.
Selenocysteine was discovered in 1974 by biochemist Thressa Stadtman at the National Institutes of Health.
