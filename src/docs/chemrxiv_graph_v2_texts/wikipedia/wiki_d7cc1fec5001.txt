Polylactic acid, also known as poly(lactic acid) or polylactide (PLA), is a plastic material. As a thermoplastic polyester (or polyhydroxyalkanoate) it has the backbone formula (C3H4O2)n or [–C(CH3)HC(=O)O–]n. PLA is formally obtained by condensation of lactic acid C(CH3)(OH)HCOOH with loss of water (hence its name). It can also be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of lactide [–C(CH3)HC(=O)O–]2, the cyclic dimer of the basic repeating unit. Often PLA is blended with other polymers. PLA can be biodegradable or long-lasting, depending on the manufacturing process, additives and copolymers.
PLA has become a popular material due to it being economically produced from renewable resources and the possibility to use it for compostable products. In 2022, PLA had the highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world, with a share of ca. 26 % of total bioplastic demand. Although its production is growing, PLA is still not as important as traditional commodity polymers like PET or PVC. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings. PLA is the most widely used plastic filament material in FDM 3D printing, due to its low melting point, high strength, low thermal expansion, and good layer adhesion, although it possesses poor heat resistance unless annealed.
Although the name "polylactic acid" is widely used, it does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, which is "poly(lactic acid)". The name "polylactic acid" is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid (polyelectrolyte), but rather a polyester.
