Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are a class of ionic solids characterized by a layered structure with the generic layer sequence [AcB Z AcB]n, where c represents layers of metal cations, A and B are layers of hydroxide (OHâˆ’) anions, and Z are layers of other anions and neutral molecules (such as water).  Lateral offsets between the layers may result in longer repeating periods.
The intercalated anions (Z) are weakly bound, often exchangeable; their intercalation properties have scientific interest and industrial applications.
LDHs occur in nature as minerals, as byproducts of metabolism of certain bacteria, and also unintentionally in man-made contexts, such as the products of corrosion of metal objects.
