Electro membrane extraction, or EME, is a miniaturized liquid-liquid extraction technique developed for sample preparation of aqueous samples prior to analysis by chromatography, electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and related techniques in analytical chemistry. EME involves the use of a small supported liquid membrane (SLM) sustained in the wall of a porous hollow fiber, and application of an electrical field across the SLM.
