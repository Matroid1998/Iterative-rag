Titanium aluminide (chemical formula TiAl), commonly gamma titanium, is an intermetallic chemical compound. It is lightweight and resistant to oxidation and heat, but has low ductility. The density of γ-TiAl is about 4.0 g/cm3. It finds use in several applications including aircraft, jet engines, sporting equipment and automobiles. The development of TiAl based alloys began circa 1970. The alloys have been used in these applications only since about 2000.
Titanium aluminide has three major intermetallic compounds: gamma titanium aluminide (gamma TiAl, γ-TiAl), alpha 2-Ti3Al and TiAl3. Among the three, gamma TiAl has received the most interest and applications.
