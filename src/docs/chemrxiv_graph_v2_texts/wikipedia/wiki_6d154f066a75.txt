An electron acceptor is a chemical entity that accepts electrons transferred to it from another compound. Electron acceptors are oxidizing agents.
The electron accepting power of an electron acceptor is measured by its redox potential.
In the simplest case, electron acceptors are reduced by one electron.  The process can alter the structure of the acceptor substantially. When the added electron is highly delocalized, the structural consequences of the reduction can be subtle. The central C-C distance in the electron acceptor tetracyanoethylene elongates from 135 to 143 pm upon acceptance of an electron.  In the formation of some donor-acceptor complexes, less than one electron is transferred.  TTF-TCNQ is a charge transfer complex.
