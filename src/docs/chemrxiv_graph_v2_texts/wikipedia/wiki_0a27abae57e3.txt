In coordination chemistry, a coordinate covalent bond, also known as a dative bond, dipolar bond, or coordinate bond is a kind of two-center, two-electron covalent bond in which the two electrons derive from the same atom.  The bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction.  This type of interaction is central to Lewis acidâ€“base theory.
Coordinate bonds are commonly found in coordination compounds.
