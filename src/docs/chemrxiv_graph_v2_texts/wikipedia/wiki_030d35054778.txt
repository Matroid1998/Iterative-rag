Molybdenum(IV) telluride, molybdenum ditelluride or just molybdenum telluride is an inorganic compound with formula MoTe2. It is a semiconductor, and can fluoresce. It is one of the transition metal dichalcogenides. As a semiconductor the band gap lies in the infrared region.  It is a potential use as a semiconductor in electronics or an infrared detector.  MoTe2 is black.  Although sometimes described as Mo4+, 2Te2-, it is not ionic but highly covalent.
