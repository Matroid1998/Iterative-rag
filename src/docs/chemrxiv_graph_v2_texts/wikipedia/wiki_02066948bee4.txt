Geranylgeraniol is a diterpenoid alcohol. It is a colorless waxy solid. It is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of other diterpenes, of vitamins E, and of K.  It is a derivative of geranylgeraniol pyrophosphate, which is a precursor to carotenoids.
Geranylgeraniol is synthesized in humans through the mevalonate pathway.
As its pyrophosphate, it is also used in the post-translational modification by the process called geranylgeranylation.  
Geranylgeraniol is a potent inhibitor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro.
