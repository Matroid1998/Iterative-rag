meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA or mCPBA) is a peroxycarboxylic acid. It is a white solid often used widely as an oxidant in organic synthesis. mCPBA is often preferred to other peroxy acids because of its relative ease of handling.  mCPBA is a strong oxidizing agent that may cause fire upon contact with flammable material.
