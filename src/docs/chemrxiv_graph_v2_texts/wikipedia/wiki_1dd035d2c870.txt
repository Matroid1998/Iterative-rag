Platinum hexafluoride is the chemical compound with the formula PtF6, and is one of seventeen known binary hexafluorides. It is a dark-red volatile solid that forms a red gas. The compound is a unique example of platinum in the +6 oxidation state. With only four d-electrons, it is paramagnetic with a triplet ground state.  PtF6 is  a strong fluorinating agent and one of the strongest oxidants, capable of oxidising xenon and O2.  PtF6 is octahedral in both the solid state and in the gaseous state. The Pt-F bond lengths are 185 picometers.
