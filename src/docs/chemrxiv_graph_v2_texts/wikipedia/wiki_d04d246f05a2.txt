Sulfuryl fluoride (also spelled sulphuryl fluoride) is an inorganic compound with the formula SO2F2. It is an easily condensed gas and has properties more similar to sulfur hexafluoride than sulfuryl chloride, being resistant to hydrolysis even up to 150 Â°C. It is neurotoxic and a potent greenhouse gas, but is widely used as a fumigant insecticide to control termites.
