A cycloparaphenylene is a molecule that consists of several benzene rings connected by covalent bonds in the para positions to form a hoop- or necklace-like structure. Its chemical formula is [C6H4]n or C6nH4n  Such a molecule is usually denoted [n]CPP where n is the number of benzene rings. 
A cycloparaphenylene can be considered as the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotube, and is a type of carbon nanohoop. Cycloparaphenylenes are challenging targets for chemical synthesis due to the ring strain incurred from forcing benzene rings out of planarity.
