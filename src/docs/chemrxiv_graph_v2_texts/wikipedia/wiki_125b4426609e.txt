Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a chemical reaction that yields H2. The conversion of protons to H2 requires reducing equivalents and usually a catalyst. In nature, HER is catalyzed by hydrogenase enzymes. Commercial electrolyzers typically employ supported platinum as the catalyst at the anode of the electrolyzer. HER is useful for producing hydrogen gas, providing a clean-burning fuel. HER, however, can also be an unwelcome side reaction that competes with other reductions such as nitrogen fixation, or electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide or chrome plating.
