Diphosphines, sometimes called bisphosphanes, are organophosphorus compounds most commonly used as bidentate phosphine ligands in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. They are identified by the presence of two phosphino groups linked by a backbone, and are usually chelating. A wide variety of diphosphines have been synthesized with different linkers and R-groups.  Alteration of the linker and R-groups alters the electronic and steric  properties of the ligands which can result in different coordination geometries and catalytic behavior in homogeneous catalysts.
