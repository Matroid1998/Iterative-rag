Hexachloroethane (perchloroethane) is an organochlorine compound with the chemical formula (CCl3)2. It is a white or colorless solid at room temperature with a camphor-like odor. It has been used by the military in smoke compositions, such as base-eject smoke munitions (smoke grenades).
Hexachloroethane was discovered along with carbon tetrachloride by Michael Faraday in 1820. Faraday obtained it by chlorinating ethylene.
