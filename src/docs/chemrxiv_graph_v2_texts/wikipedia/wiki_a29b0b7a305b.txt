The Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is a strong vasodilator produced by cardiac endothelial cells in response to stress signals such as high levels of ADP accumulation or hypoxia. Robert F. Furchgott is widely recognised for this discovery, even going so far as to be a co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine with his colleagues Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key component in any EDRF as these compounds either include NO or are structurally in the form of NO.
