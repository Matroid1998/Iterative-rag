Ormosil is a shorthand phrase for organically modified silica or organically modified silicate.  In general, ormosils are produced by adding silane to silica-derived gel during the sol-gel process. They are engineered materials that show great promise in a wide range of applications such as:

alternative to viral vectors for gene delivery, with higher transient transfection efficiencies
suspension media and substrates for next generation solar cells (quantum dots)and photocatalytic oxidation of water
matrix material for UV-protection coating
matrix material for laser dye-doped organic-inorganic solid state dye lasers
This technology has been demonstrated as a nonviral vector to successfully deliver DNA loads to specifically targeted cells in living animals. Confirmation of results demonstrated that new DNA was working and expressed genes in the animal.
