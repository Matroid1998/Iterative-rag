In organic chemistry, a directing group (DG) is a substituent on a molecule or ion that facilitates reactions by interacting with a reagent.  The term is usually applied to C–H activation of hydrocarbons, where it is defined as a "coordinating moiety (an 'internal ligand'), which directs a metal catalyst into the proximity of a certain C–H bond." In a well known example, the ketone group (C=O) in acetophenone is the DG in the Murai reaction.

The Murai reaction is related to directed ortho metalation, a reaction is typically applied to the lithiation of substituted aromatic rings.

A wide variety of functional groups can serve as directing groups.
