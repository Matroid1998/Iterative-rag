Polystyrene sulfonates are a group of medications used to treat high blood potassium. Effects generally take hours to days. They are also used to remove potassium, calcium, and sodium from solutions in technical applications.
Common side effects include loss of appetite, gastrointestinal upset, constipation, and low blood calcium. These polymers are derived from polystyrene by the addition of sulfonate functional groups.
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958.
A polystyrene sulfonate was developed in the 2000s to treat  Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea under the name Tolevamer, but it was never marketed.
