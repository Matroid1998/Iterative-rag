Acrylates (IUPAC: prop-2-enoates) are the salts, esters, and conjugate bases of acrylic acid.  The acrylate ion is the anion CH2=CHCOâˆ’2. Often, acrylate refers to esters of acrylic acid, the most common member being methyl acrylate. These acrylates contain vinyl groups. These compounds are of interest because they are bifunctional: the vinyl group is susceptible to polymerization and the carboxylate group carries myriad functionalities.
