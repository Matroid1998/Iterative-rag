In organic chemistry, a cyclo[n]carbon (or simply cyclocarbon) is a chemical compound consisting solely of a number n of carbon atoms covalently linked in a ring. Since the compounds are composed only of carbon atoms, they are allotropes of carbon. Possible bonding patterns include all double bonds (a cyclic cumulene) or alternating single bonds and triple bonds (a cyclic polyyne).
The first cyclocarbon synthesized is cyclo[18]carbon (C18). Besides that, C6, C10, C12, C13, C14, C16, C20, and C26 are all known.
