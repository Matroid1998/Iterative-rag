Caesium carbonate or cesium carbonate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula Cs2CO3. It is white crystalline solid. Caesium carbonate has a high solubility in polar solvents such as water, ethanol and DMF. Its solubility is higher in organic solvents compared to other carbonates like potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate, although it remains quite insoluble in other organic solvents such as toluene, p-xylene, and chlorobenzene. This compound is used in organic synthesis as a base. It also appears to have applications in energy conversion.
