Name: Dicyclopentadiene
Text:
Dicyclopentadiene appears as a liquid with an acrid odor. Flash point 90 Â°F. The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory system. Subject to polymerization if subjected to heat for prolonged periods or if contaminated. If the polymerization takes place inside a container, the container may violently rupture. Insoluble in water. Density 8.2 lb / gal. Used in paints, varnishes, as an intermediate in insecticides, as a flame retardant in plastics.
Dicyclopentadiene is a cyclic olefin.
