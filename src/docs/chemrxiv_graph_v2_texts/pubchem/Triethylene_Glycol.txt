Name: Triethylene Glycol
Text:
Triethylene glycol is a colorless liquid with a mild odor. Dense than water. (USCG, 1999)
Triethylene glycol is a poly(ethylene glycol) that is octane-1,8-diol in which the carbon atoms at positions 3 and 6 have been replaced by oxygen atoms. It has a role as a plasticiser. It is a poly(ethylene glycol), a diol and a primary alcohol.
Triethylene glycol has been reported in Solanum lycopersicum with data available.
