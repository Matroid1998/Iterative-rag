Name: Herbacetin
Text:
Herbacetin is a pentahydroxyflavone that is kaempferol substituted by a hydroxy group at position 8. It is a natural flavonoid from flaxseed which exerts antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. It has a role as an EC 4.1.1.17 (ornithine decarboxylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an apoptosis inducer, an angiogenesis inhibitor, a plant metabolite, an antilipemic drug, an anti-inflammatory agent and an EC 3.4.22.69 (SARS coronavirus main proteinase) inhibitor. It is a pentahydroxyflavone and a 7-hydroxyflavonol. It is functionally related to a kaempferol.
Herbacetin has been reported in Sinocrassula indica, Rhodiola crenulata, and other organisms with data available.
