Text:
Tetracene is an acene that consists of four ortho-fused benzene rings in a rectilinear arrangement. It is an acene and a member of tetracenes.
Tetracene is one of over 100 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning organic substances, such as fossil fuels. They are usually found as a mixture containing two or more of these compounds. (L10)
