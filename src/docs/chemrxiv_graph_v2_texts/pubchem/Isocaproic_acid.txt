Name: Isocaproic acid
Text:
Isocaproic acid is a methyl-branched fatty acid that is pentanoic acid with a methyl group substituent at position 4. It is a metabolite of 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a branched-chain saturated fatty acid, a methyl-branched fatty acid and a medium-chain fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of an isocaproate.
4-Methylpentanoic acid has been reported in Amorphophallus elatus, Pelargonium graveolens, and other organisms with data available.
