Text:
Methylcyclohexane appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor. Flash point 25 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air.
Methylcyclohexane is a cycloalkane that is cyclohexane substituted by a single methyl group. It has a role as an aprotic solvent, a plant metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a cycloalkane and a volatile organic compound. It derives from a hydride of a cyclohexane.
Methylcyclohexane has been reported in Opuntia ficus-indica, Nicotiana tabacum, and other organisms with data available.
