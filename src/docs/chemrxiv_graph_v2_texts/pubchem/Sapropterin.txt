Name: Sapropterin
Text:
Sapropterin is a tetrahydropterin that is 2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridin-4(3H)-one in which a hydrogen at position 6 is substituted by a 1,2-dihydroxypropyl group (6R,1'R,2'S-enantiomer). It has a role as a coenzyme, a diagnostic agent, a human metabolite and a cofactor.
Sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin or BH4) is a cofactor in the synthesis of nitric oxide. It is also essential in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase; the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase; and conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan via tryptophan hydroxylase.
L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Sapropterin is a Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Activator. The mechanism of action of sapropterin is as a Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Activator, and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibitor, and P-Glycoprotein Inhibitor.
Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor that is essential for the activity of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Tetrahydrobiopterin degrades phenylalanine, and facilitates the biosynthesis of several neurotransmitters and the production of nitric oxide.
SAPROPTERIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2007 and is indicated for hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria and has 20 investigational indications.
