Name: Ciclesonide
Text:
Ciclesonide is an organic molecular entity.
Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid used to treat obstructive airway diseases. It is marketed under the brand name Alvesco.
Ciclesonide is a nonhalogenated, synthetic, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral activities. Upon administration by oral inhalation into the lungs, ciclesonide (CIC) is converted by local esterases to its active metabolite desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), which binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). The ligand-bound GRs regulate gene expressions, which lead to inhibitory activities against multiple cell types, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, and various mediators associated with inflammation, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes and cytokines. In addition, ciclesonide may suppress the replication of human coronavirus by targeting viral nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15).
CICLESONIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2006 and has 6 approved and 4 investigational indications.
