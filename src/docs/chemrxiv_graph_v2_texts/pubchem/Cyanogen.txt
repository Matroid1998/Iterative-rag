Name: Cyanogen
Text:
Cyanogen appears as a colorless gas with an odor of almonds. Freezes at -28 °C and boils at -20.7 °C. Shipped as a liquid confined under its vapor pressure. The gas is heavier than air and a flame can travel back to the source of leak very easily. Prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat may cause the containers to violently rupture and rocket. Used to make other chemicals, as a fumigant, and as a rocket propellant.
Oxalonitrile is a dinitrile that is ethane substituted by two cyano groups. It is a pseudohalogen and a dinitrile.
Cyanogen is a chemical compound of cyanide.
