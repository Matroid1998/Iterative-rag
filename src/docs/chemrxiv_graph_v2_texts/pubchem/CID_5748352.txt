Text:
Chlorophyll is a porphyrin derivative conjugated with a magnesium ion that is found in plant chloroplasts, algae and cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll is essential to the process of photosynthesis. It absorbs light in the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum and transfers the absorbed photon energy to an electron, which is used to produce ATP.
Porphyrin derivatives containing magnesium that act to convert light energy in photosynthetic organisms.
