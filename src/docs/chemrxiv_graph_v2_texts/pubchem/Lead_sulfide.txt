Name: Lead sulfide
Text:
Lead sulfide appears as black to silvery powdery or crystalline solid. Sinks in water. (USCG, 1999)
Galena is a mineral with formula of Pb2+S2- or PbS. The IMA symbol is Gn.
Lead sulfide is a sulfide of lead that occurs naturally as the mineral galena. It is used as a semiconductor and infrared detector. Lead is a heavy metal and stable element with the symbol Pb and the atomic number 82, existing in metallic, organic, and inorganic forms. It is mainly found in nature as the mineral galena (PbS), cerussite (PbCO3) or anglesite (PbSO4), usually in ore with zinc, silver, or copper. (L21, L417)
