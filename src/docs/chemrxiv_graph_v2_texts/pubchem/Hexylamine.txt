Name: Hexylamine
Text:
Hexylamine appears as a water-white liquid with an amine-like odor. Less dense than water and poorly soluble in water. Hence floats on water. May be toxic by inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.
1-hexanamine is a 6-carbon primary aliphatic amine. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a conjugate base of a hexan-1-aminium.
Hexylamine has been reported in Apis cerana and Euglena gracilis with data available.
