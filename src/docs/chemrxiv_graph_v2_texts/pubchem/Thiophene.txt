Name: Thiophene
Text:
Thiophene appears as a colorless liquid with an unpleasant odor. Insoluble in water and slightly denser than water. Flash point 30 Â°F. Vapors heavier than air. Irritates the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Used to make pharmaceuticals and dyes.
Thiophene is a monocyclic heteroarene that is furan in which the oxygen atom is replaced by a sulfur. It has a role as a non-polar solvent. It is a mancude organic heteromonocyclic parent, a member of thiophenes, a monocyclic heteroarene and a volatile organic compound.
Thiophene has been reported in Solanum lycopersicum, Coffea arabica, and other organisms with data available.
Thiophene is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A monocyclic heteroarene furan in which the oxygen atom is replaced by a sulfur.
