Name: Gallium
Text:
Gallium is a silvery-white liquid or a soft, malleable solid at room temperature. Ingestion of this material may be toxic. It is corrosive to aluminum. If exposed to high temperatures, gallium may emit toxic fumes which may form a corrosive alkaline solution with water. It is soluble in most acids and alkalis. It is used as a semiconductor material.
Gallium atom is a metallic element predicted as eka-aluminium by Mendeleev in 1870 and discovered by Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875. Named in honour of France (Latin Gallia) and perhaps also from the Latin gallus cock, a translation of Lecoq.
Gallium is an element with atomic symbol Ga, atomic number 31, and atomic weight 69.7. A rare silvery (usually trivalent) metallic element; brittle at low temperatures but liquid above room temperature; occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores.
gallium is a mineral.
A rare, metallic element designated by the symbol, Ga, atomic number 31, and atomic weight 69.72.
