Tert-butyl hydroperoxide is an alkyl hydroperoxide in which the alkyl group is tert-butyl. It is widely used in a variety of oxidation processes. It has a role as an antibacterial agent and an oxidising agent.
Tert-butyl hydroperoxide has been reported in Apium graveolens with data available.
A direct-acting oxidative stress-inducing agent used to examine the effects of oxidant stress on Ca(2+)-dependent signal transduction in vascular endothelial cells. It is also used as a catalyst in polymerization reactions and to introduce peroxy groups into organic molecules.
