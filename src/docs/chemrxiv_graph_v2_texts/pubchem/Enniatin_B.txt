Name: Enniatin B
Text:
Enniatin B is an enniatin obtained from formal cyclocondensation of three N-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoyl]-N-methyl-L-valine units. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent.
Enniatin B has been reported in Fusarium lateritium, Fusarium acuminatum, and other organisms with data available.
Enniatins are mycotoxins that appear in nature as a mixture of cyclohexadepsipeptides produced by bacteria, fungi, and plants. They may be found in contaminated cereal crops. Enniatins have various biological activities and can act as enzyme inhibitors, antifungal and antibacterial agents, and immunomodulatory substances. (L1965, A3055)
