Name: Flufenamic Acid
Text:
Flufenamic acid is an aromatic amino acid consisting of anthranilic acid carrying an N-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl substituent. An analgesic and anti-inflammatory, it is used in rheumatic disorders. It has a role as an EC 1.14.99.1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) inhibitor, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic and an antipyretic. It is an aromatic amino acid and an organofluorine compound. It is functionally related to a diphenylamine, an anthranilic acid and a (trifluoromethyl)benzene. It is a conjugate acid of a flufenamate.
An anthranilic acid derivative with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. It is used in musculoskeletal and joint disorders and administered by mouth and topically. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p16)
