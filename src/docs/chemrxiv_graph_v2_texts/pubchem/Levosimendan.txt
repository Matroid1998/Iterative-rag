Name: Levosimendan
Text:
Levosimendan is a hydrazone, a pyridazinone and a nitrile. It has a role as a vasodilator agent, an EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase) inhibitor, a cardiotonic drug and an anti-arrhythmia drug.
Levosimendan increases calcium sensitivity to myocytes by binding to troponin C in a calcium dependent manner. This increases contractility without raising calcium levels. It also relaxes vascular smooth muscle by opening adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channels. Levosimendan is used to manage acutely decompensated congestive heart failure.
LEVOSIMENDAN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 15 investigational indications.
A hydrazone and pyridazine derivative; the levo-form is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, calcium-sensitizing agent, and inotropic agent that is used in the treatment of HEART FAILURE.
