Text:
Catecholamine is a group of sympathetic amines containing a catechol group derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Catecholamines are hormones and neuromodulators synthesized in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal glands and the postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic nervous system in response to stress. Examples of catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and dopamine, all of which participate in a wide variety of functions throughout the body.
A general class of ortho-dihydroxyphenylalkylamines derived from tyrosine.
