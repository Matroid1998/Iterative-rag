Name: N,N-Dimethylacetamide
Text:
N,N-Dimethylacetamide can cause cancer according to California Labor Code. It can cause developmental toxicity and male reproductive toxicity according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.
Dimethylacetamide appears as a clear colorless liquid with a faint odor similar to ammonia. About the same density as water. Flash point 145 Â°F. Vapors heavier than air. May by toxic by skin absorption. May irritate eyes and skin.
N,N-dimethylacetamide is a member of the class of acetamides that is acetamide in which the hydrogens attached to the N atom have been replaced by two methyl groups respectively. Metabolite observed in cancer metabolism. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a member of acetamides and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It is functionally related to an acetamide.
N,N-Dimethylacetamide is a dipolar aprotic solvent and reagent that may be used in the production of fibers and pharmaceuticals, and as a non-aldehyde fixative.
