1,3-Dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.
1,3-dichloro-2-propanol is a colorless to yellow slightly viscous liquid with an ethereal odor. (NTP, 1992)
1,3-dichloropropanol-2 appears as a colorless liquid with an ether-like odor. Denser than water and slightly soluble in water. Toxic by ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption and may irritate skin and eyes.
1,3-dichloropropan-2-ol is a secondary alcohol that is isopropanol in which one hydrogen of each methyl group is substituted by a chlorine. A liquid at room temperature (melting point -4℃, boiling point 174℃ at 760 mm Hg), it is used as a solvent for hard resins and nitrocellulose. It has a role as a protic solvent and a cross-linking reagent. It is a secondary alcohol and an organochlorine compound.
