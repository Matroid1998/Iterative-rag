Name: Benzylideneacetone
Text:
Trans-benzylideneacetone is the trans-isomer of benzylideneacetone. It acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) of insects like diamond back moth. It has a role as a flavouring agent, a fragrance, a bacterial metabolite and an EC 3.1.1.4 (phospholipase A2) inhibitor.
Benzylideneacetone has been reported in Basella alba and Polygala senega with data available.
Benzylideneacetone is a flavouring ingredient. Benzylideneacetone is present in hydrolysed soy protein

Benzylideneacetone belongs to the family of Phenylpropenes. These are compounds containing a phenylpropene moeity, which consists of a propene substituent bound to a phenyl group.
