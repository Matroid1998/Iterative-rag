Name: Aflatoxins
Text:
Aflatoxin G is a member of coumarins.
Aflatoxin G1 has been reported in Zea mays, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus parasiticus with data available.
Aflatoxin is a group of mycotoxins, which are most commonly produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, and their toxic metabolites that are comprised of a fused coumarin-bis(dihydrofuran) ring structure, with potential acute and chronic toxic effects. Acute exposure to high levels of aflatoxins can cause liver damage. Chronic aflatoxin exposure results in an increased risk for liver cancer potentially caused by DNA intercalation and epoxide-mediated alkylation of nucleobases by aflatoxin metabolites, leading to increased levels of DNA damage, which may cause mutations.
Aflatoxin G is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus

Aflatoxin G belongs to the family of Difurocoumarolactone Series. These are polycyclic aromatic compounds containing a delta-valerolactone ring fused to the coumarin moiety of the difurocoumarin skeleton. Difurocoumarolactones are a subgroup of the aflatoxins and related compounds.
