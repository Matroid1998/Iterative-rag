Name: Myricetin
Text:
Myricetin is a hexahydroxyflavone that is flavone substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 3', 4', 5, 5' and 7. It has been isolated from the leaves of Myrica rubra and other plants. It has a role as a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent, an antioxidant, a plant metabolite, a food component, a hypoglycemic agent and a geroprotector. It is a hexahydroxyflavone and a 7-hydroxyflavonol. It is a conjugate acid of a myricetin(1-).
Myricetin has been reported in Caragana frutex, Camellia sinensis, and other organisms with data available.
Myricetin is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
