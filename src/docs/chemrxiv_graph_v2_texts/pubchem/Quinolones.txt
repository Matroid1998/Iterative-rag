Name: Quinolones
Text:
Quinolin-2-ol is a monohydroxyquinoline carrying a hydroxy substituent at position 2. It is an intermediate metabolite produced duting the microbial degradation of quinoline. It has a role as a bacterial xenobiotic metabolite. It is a tautomer of a quinolin-2(1H)-one.
2-Hydroxyquinoline has been reported in Glycosmis pentaphylla, Houttuynia cordata, and Aconitum ferox with data available.
