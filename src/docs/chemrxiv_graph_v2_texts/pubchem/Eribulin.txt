Name: Eribulin
Text:
Eribulin is a fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of marine sponge natural products. Inhibits growth phase of microtubules via tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism, which leads to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a microtubule-destabilising agent. It is a macrocycle, a polyether, a polycyclic ether, a cyclic ketone, a primary amino compound and a cyclic ketal. It is a conjugate base of an eribulin(1+).
Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease. Eribulin was isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai. Eribulin is also being investigated for use in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
Eribulin is a Microtubule Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of eribulin is by means of Microtubule Inhibition.
Eribulin mesylate is an inhibitor of microtubule function and is used as an antineoplastic agent for refractory, metastatic breast cancer and liposarcoma. Despite its cytotoxic activity against cancer cells, eribulin has rarely been implicated in causing clinically apparent acute liver injury.
Eribulin is an analogue of halichondrin B, a substance derived from a marine sponge (Lissodendoryx sp.) with antineoplastic activity. Eribulin binds to the vinca domain of tubulin and inhibits the polymerization of tubulin and the assembly of microtubules, resulting in inhibition of mitotic spindle assembly, induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, and, potentially, tumor regression.
ERIBULIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2010 and has 6 approved and 33 investigational indications.
