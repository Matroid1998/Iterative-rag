Name: Indium phosphide
Text:
Indium Phosphide can cause cancer according to The National Toxicology Program.
Indium phosphide is a phosphide of indium. It is a semiconductor used in high-power and high-frequency electronics because of its superior electron velocity with respect to the more common semiconductors silicon and gallium arsenide. It also has a direct bandgap, making it useful for optoelectronics devices like laser diodes. Metal phosphides are hydrolysed to phosphine upon contact with water or stomach acid. Phosphine is a colorless, flammable, explosive, and toxic gas. (L980, L986)
