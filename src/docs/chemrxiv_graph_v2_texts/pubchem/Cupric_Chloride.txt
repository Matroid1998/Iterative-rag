Name: Cupric Chloride
Text:
Copper chloride appears as a yellowish-brown powder (the anhydrous form) or a green crystalline solid (the dihydrate). Noncombustible but hydrogen chloride gas may form when heated in a fire. Corrosive to aluminum. Used to manufacture other chemicals, in dyeing, in printing, in fungicides, as a wood preservative.
Copper(II) chloride is an inorganic chloride of copper in which the metal is in the +2 oxidation state. It has a role as an EC 5.3.3.5 (cholestenol Delta-isomerase) inhibitor. It is an inorganic chloride and a copper molecular entity. It contains a copper(2+).
Cupric chloride, for injection, is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution intended for use as an additive to solutions for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).
Copper(II) chloride is a chloride of copper. It is used in organic synthesis and in pyrotechnics as a blue/green coloring agent. (L299)
