Name: Ergosterol
Text:
Ergosterol is a phytosterol consisting of ergostane having double bonds at the 5,6-, 7,8- and 22,23-positions as well as a 3beta-hydroxy group. It has a role as a fungal metabolite and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a 3beta-sterol, an ergostanoid, a 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid and a member of phytosterols.
A steroid of interest both because its biosynthesis in FUNGI is a target of ANTIFUNGAL AGENTS, notably AZOLES, and because when it is present in SKIN of animals, ULTRAVIOLET RAYS break a bond to result in ERGOCALCIFEROL.
Ergosterol has been reported in Agaricus blazei, Gymnopilus spectabilis, and other organisms with data available.
ergosterol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A steroid occurring in FUNGI. Irradiation with ULTRAVIOLET RAYS results in formation of ERGOCALCIFEROL (vitamin D2).
