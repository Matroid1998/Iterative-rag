Name: Cyclopamine
Text:
Cyclopamine is a member of piperidines. It has a role as a glioma-associated oncogene inhibitor.
Cyclopamine has been reported in Veratrum dahuricum, Veratrum grandiflorum, and Veratrum californicum with data available.
Cyclopamine is a naturally occurring chemical that belongs to the group of steroidal jerveratrum alkaloids. It is a teratogen isolated from the corn lily (Veratrum californicum) that causes usually fatal birth defects. It can prevent the fetal brain from dividing into two lobes (holoprosencephaly) and cause the development of a single eye (cyclopia). It does so by inhibiting the hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh). Cyclopamine is useful in studying the role of Hh in normal development, and as a potential treatment for certain cancers in which Hh is overexpressed.
