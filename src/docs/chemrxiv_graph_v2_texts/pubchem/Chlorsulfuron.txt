Name: Chlorsulfuron
Text:
Chlorsulfuron appears as colorless crystals. Non corrosive. Insoluble in water. Used as an herbicide.
Chlorsulfuron is an N-sulfonylurea that is N-carbamoyl-2-chlorobenzenesulfonamide in which one of the hydrogens attached to the non-sulfonylated nitrogen has been replaced by a 4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl group. A herbicide used for the control of broadleaf weeds in wheat, barley and oats. It has a role as an agrochemical, a herbicide and an EC 2.2.1.6 (acetolactate synthase) inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea, a member of monochlorobenzenes and a methoxy-1,3,5-triazine.
Chlorsulfuron is a triazine herbicide that is recommended for selective control of weeds in wheat (pre- and/or postemergent to crop) and barley (postemergent to crop) as well as reduced tillage fallow preceding wheat.  Controls most broadleaf and some grass weeds.
