Name: Trimethylaluminum
Text:
Trimethylaluminium (TMA) is an organoaluminium compound. It is used in the production of methylaluminoxane and Tebbe's reagent, as well as in semiconductor fabrication to grow thin film, high-k dielectrics. Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and is always found combined with other elements such as oxygen, silicon, and fluorine.  (L739, L740, L782)
