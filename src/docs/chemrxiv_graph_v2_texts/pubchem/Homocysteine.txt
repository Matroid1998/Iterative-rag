Name: Homocysteine
Text:
L-homocysteine is a homocysteine that has L configuration. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a homocysteine and a serine family amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a L-homocysteinate. It is a tautomer of a L-homocysteine zwitterion.
Homocysteine is a thiol-containing amino acid formed by a demethylation of methionine.
L-Homocysteine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Homocysteine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
L-Homocysteine has been reported in Homo sapiens and Caenorhabditis elegans with data available.
Homocysteine is an amino acid derivative and homolog of cysteine containing an additional methylene bridge. Homocysteine is a product of methionine metabolism and elevated plasma levels are associated with cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease and several metabolic diseases.
A thiol-containing amino acid formed by a demethylation of METHIONINE.
