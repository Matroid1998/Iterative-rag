Triethanolamine is an oily liquid with a mild ammonia odor. Denser than water. Freezing point is 71 Â°F. (USCG, 1999)
Triethanolamine is a tertiary amino compound that is ammonia in which each of the hydrogens is substituted by a 2-hydroxyethyl group. It has a role as a buffer and a surfactant. It is a tertiary amino compound, a triol and an amino alcohol. It is functionally related to a triethylamine. It is a conjugate base of a triethanolammonium.
Trolamine, which is also referred to as triethanolamine (TEA), is a tertiary amine and a triol. It is a bifunctional compound that exhibits both properties of alcohols and amines. Trolamine contains small amounts of diethanolamine and ethanolamine and may also act as an antioxidant against the auto-oxidation of animal and vegetable fats. It is commonly used as a pH adjuster and surfactant in industrial and cosmetic products such as skin and hair conditioning products.
Triethanolamine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Triethanolamine has been reported in Phaseolus vulgaris with data available.
TROLAMINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and is indicated for skin ulcer.
Triethanolamine is used as a food additive [EAFUS] ("EAFUS: Everything Added to Food in the United States. [http://www.eafus.com/]").

Triethanolamine belongs to the family of Alkylamines. These are organic compounds containing an alkylamine group.
