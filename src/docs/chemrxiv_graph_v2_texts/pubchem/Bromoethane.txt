Text:
Bromoethane can cause cancer according to The National Toxicology Program.
Ethyl bromide appears as a colorless volatile liquid. Slightly soluble in water and denser than water. Flash point below 0 Â°F. Vapors are heavier than air. Toxic by inhalation. Irritates skin and eyes. Used to make pharmaceuticals and as a solvent.
Bromoethane is a bromoalkane that is ethane carrying a bromo substituent. It is an alkylating agent used as a chemical intermediate in various organic syntheses. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, a solvent, a refrigerant, a local anaesthetic and an alkylating agent. It is a bromoalkane, a bromohydrocarbon and a volatile organic compound.
Bromoethane is an alkylating agent used primarily as a chemical intermediate in various organic syntheses. It is an organobromide (L1986).
