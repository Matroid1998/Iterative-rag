Name: Cyclohexane
Text:
Cyclohexane appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor. Used to make nylon, as a solvent, paint remover, and to make other chemicals. Flash point -4 Â°F. Density 6.5 lb / gal (less than water) and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air.
Cyclohexane is an alicyclic hydrocarbon comprising a ring of six carbon atoms; the cyclic form of hexane, used as a raw material in the manufacture of nylon. It has a role as a non-polar solvent. It is a cycloalkane and a volatile organic compound.
Cyclohexane has been reported in Manilkara zapota, Helichrysum odoratissimum, and other organisms with data available.
Cyclohexane is found in kohlrabi. Diluent in colour additive mixtures for food use

Cyclohexane has been shown to exhibit beta-oxidant, anti-nociceptive and antibiotic functions (A7840, A7841, A7842).

Cyclohexane belongs to the family of Cycloalkanes. These are alkanes containing one or more rings of carbon atoms.
