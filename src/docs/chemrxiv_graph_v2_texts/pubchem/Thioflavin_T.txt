Name: Thioflavin T
Text:
Thioflavine T is an organic chloride salt having 2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-1,3-benzothiazol-3-ium as the counterion. It is widely used to visualise and quantify the presence of amyloids, both in vitro and in vivo. It has a role as a fluorochrome, a histological dye and a geroprotector. It contains a thioflavin T cation.
