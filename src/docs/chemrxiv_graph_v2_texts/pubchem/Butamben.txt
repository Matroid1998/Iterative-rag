Name: Butamben
Text:
N-butyl-p-aminobenzoate is a yellow powder. Insoluble in water. (NTP, 1992)
Butamben is an amino acid ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-aminobenzoic acid with the hydroxy group of butan-1-ol. Its local anaesthetic properties have been used for surface anaesthesia of the skin and mucous membranes, and for relief of pain and itching associated with some anorectal disorders. It has a role as a local anaesthetic. It is a benzoate ester, a substituted aniline, an amino acid ester and a primary amino compound. It is functionally related to a 4-aminobenzoic acid and a butan-1-ol. It is a conjugate base of a butamben(1+).
Butamben is a local anesthetic in the form of n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate. Its structure corresponds to the standard molecule of a hydrophilic and hydrophobic domain separated by an intermediate ester found in most of the local anesthetics. Due to its very low water solubility, butamben is considered to be suitable only for topical anesthesia. The FDA removed all parenteral butamben products from the market, possibly due to the poor solubility of this drug.
BUTAMBEN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV. It was withdrawn in at least one region.
