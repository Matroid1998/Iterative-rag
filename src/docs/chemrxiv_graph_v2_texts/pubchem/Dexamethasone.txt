Dexamethazone is an odorless white to off-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste. (NTP, 1992)
Dexamethasone is a fluorinated steroid that is 9-fluoropregna-1,4-diene substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 11, 17 and 21, a methyl group at position 16 and oxo groups at positions 3 and 20. It is a synthetic member of the class of glucocorticoids. It has a role as an adrenergic agent, an antiemetic, an antineoplastic agent, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, an immunosuppressive agent and an anti-inflammatory drug. It is a fluorinated steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta(1),Delta(4)-steroid, a glucocorticoid, a 20-oxo steroid, an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a 17alpha-hydroxy steroid and a 21-hydroxy steroid. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane.
Dexamethasone, or MK-125, is a corticosteroid fluorinated at position 9 used to treat endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions. Developed in 1957, it is structurally similar to other corticosteroids like [hydrocortisone] and [prednisolone].  Dexamethasone was granted FDA approval on 30 October 1958. In a press release for the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial on 16 June 2020, dexamethasone was recommended for use in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms. Dexamethasone reduced deaths by approximately one third in patients requiring ventilation and by one fifth in those requiring oxygen.
Dexamethasone is a Corticosteroid. The mechanism of action of dexamethasone is as a Corticosteroid Hormone Receptor Agonist.
Dexamethasone has been reported in Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis, Penicillium chrysogenum, and other organisms with data available.
Dexamethasone is a synthetic adrenal corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory properties. In addition to binding to specific nuclear steroid receptors, dexamethasone also interferes with NF-kB activation and apoptotic pathways. This agent lacks the salt-retaining properties of other related adrenal hormones. (NCI04)
DEXAMETHASONE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1958 and has 79 approved and 221 investigational indications.
