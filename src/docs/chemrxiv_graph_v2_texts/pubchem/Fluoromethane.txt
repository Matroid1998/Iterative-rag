Name: Fluoromethane
Text:
Methyl fluoride (or fluoromethane) is a colorless flammable gas which is heavier than air. It has an agreeable ether-like odor. It is narcotic in high concentrations. It burns with evolution of hydrogen fluoride. The flame is colorless, similar to alcohol. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket.
Fluoromethane is a member of the class of fluoromethanes that is methane in which a single hydrogen is substituted by a fluorine atom. It has a role as a refrigerant. It is a member of fluoromethanes, a fluorohydrocarbon and a member of methyl halides.
