Name: Nitisinone
Text:
Nitisinone is a cyclohexanone that is cyclohexane-1,3-dione substituted at position 2 by a 2-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl group. It is used in the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. It has a role as an EC 1.13.11.27 (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) inhibitor. It is a member of cyclohexanones, a C-nitro compound, a member of (trifluoromethyl)benzenes and a mesotrione.
Nitisinone is a synthetic reversible inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. It is used in the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. It is sold under the brand name Orfadin.
Nitisinone is a 4-Hydroxyphenyl-Pyruvate Dioxygenase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of nitisinone is as a Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2E1 Inducer, and Organic Anion Transporter 1 Inhibitor, and Organic Anion Transporter 3 Inhibitor.
Nitisinone is an inhibitor of the tyrosine catabolism that is used to treat hereditary tyrosinemia, type 1, in which accumulation of intermediates of tyrosine metabolism causes severe and progressive hepatic and renal injury. Nitisinone has been associated with mild, transient serum aminotransferase elevations, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury or jaundice.
NITISINONE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2002 and is indicated for tyrosinemia and has 2 investigational indications.
