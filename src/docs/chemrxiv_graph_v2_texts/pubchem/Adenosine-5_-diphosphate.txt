Name: Adenosine-5'-diphosphate
Text:
ADP is a purine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate having adenine as the nucleobase. It has a role as a human metabolite and a fundamental metabolite. It is an adenosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphate. It is a conjugate acid of an ADP(3-) and an ADP(2-).
Adenosine diphosphate is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Adenosine-5'-diphosphate has been reported in Helianthus tuberosus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.
ADP is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Adenosine 5'-(trihydrogen diphosphate). An adenine nucleotide containing two phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety at the 5'-position.
