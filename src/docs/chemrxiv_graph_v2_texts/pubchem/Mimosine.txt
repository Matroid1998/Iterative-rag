Name: Mimosine
Text:
L-mimosine is an L-alpha-amino acid that is propionic acid substituted by an amino group at position 2 and a 3-hydroxy-4-oxopyridin-1(4H)-yl group at position 3 (the 2S-stereoisomer). It a non-protein plant amino acid isolated from Mimosa pudica. It has a role as an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor and a plant metabolite. It is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid and a member of 4-pyridones. It is functionally related to a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a L-mimosine(1-). It is a tautomer of a L-mimosine zwitterion.
Mimosine is an antineoplastic alanine-substituted pyridine derivative isolated from Leucena glauca.
L-mimosine has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana, Euglena gracilis, and Caenorhabditis elegans with data available.
3-Hydroxy-4-oxo-1(4H)-pyridinealanine. An antineoplastic alanine-substituted pyridine derivative isolated from Leucena glauca.
