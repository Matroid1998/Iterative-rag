Name: Ethylene
Text:
Ethylene appears as a colorless gas with a sweet odor and taste. It is lighter than air. It is easily ignited and a flame can easily flash back to the source of the leak. Under prolonged exposure to fire or heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. Can cause explosion.
Ethylene, refrigerated liquid (cryogenic liquid) appears as a pressurized liquid when shipped below 50 Â°F. Colorless with a sweet odor and taste. Vapors arising from the boiling liquid are lighter than air. Easily ignited. Not toxic but is a simple asphyxiant. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. Used as an anesthetic, a refrigerant, and to make other chemicals.
Ethene is an alkene and a gas molecular entity. It has a role as a refrigerant and a plant hormone.
Ethylene has been reported in Marsilea quadrifolia, Capsicum annuum, and other organisms with data available.
ETHYLENE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.
