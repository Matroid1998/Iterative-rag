Name: Bifenthrin
Text:
Bifenthrin is an off-white to pale tan waxy solid with a very faint slightly sweet odor. Used as a broad spectrum insecticide.
Bifenthrin is a carboxylic ester obtained by formal condensation of cis-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid and [(2-methyl-1,1'-biphenyl)-3-yl]methanol. It has a role as a pyrethroid ester insecticide and a pyrethroid ester acaricide. It is an organochlorine compound, an organofluorine compound and a cyclopropanecarboxylate ester. It is functionally related to a cis-chrysanthemic acid.
Bifenthrin is under investigation in clinical trial NCT01560247 (Percutaneous Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke Management in Europe Observational Registry).
