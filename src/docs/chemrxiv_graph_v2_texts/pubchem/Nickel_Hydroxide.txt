Name: Nickel Hydroxide
Text:
Nickel Hydroxide can cause cancer according to California Labor Code.
Nickel hydroxide appears as a fine green powder. Slightly soluble in water and denser than water. Primary hazard is threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit spread to the environment.
Nickel Hydroxide is a green, crystalline, inorganic compound that produces toxic gases upon heating. Nickel hydroxide is used in nickel-cadmium batteries and as a catalyst in chemical reactions. Exposure to this substance can cause severe dermatitis, skin and asthma-like allergies and affects the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and neurological system. Nickel hydroxide is a known carcinogen and is associated with an increased risk of developing lung and nasal cancers. (NCI05)
Nickel hydroxide is a hydroxide of nickel. It occurs naturally as the mineral theophrastite, which is very rare. Nickel hydroxide is used in rechargeable battery electrodes. Nickel is a chemical compound with the atomic number 28. It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Nickel has a biological role and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. (L40, L41, L44)
