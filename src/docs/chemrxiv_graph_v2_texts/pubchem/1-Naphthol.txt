Name: 1-Naphthol
Text:
1-naphthol is a naphthol carrying a hydroxy group at position 1. It has a role as a genotoxin and a human xenobiotic metabolite.
1-Naphthol has been reported in Selaginella sinensis, Juglans nigra, and Magnolia liliiflora with data available.
1-naphthol (1N) is a metabolite of carbaryl and naphthalene that is an intermediate in Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. It is generated by spontaneous reaction from (1R,2S)-Naphthalene epoxide then is it converted to 1,4-Dihydroxynaphthalene. Although 1-Naphthol is not persistent in the body, a single urine sample may adequately predict exposure over several months to chlorpyrifos, which is a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. In adult men, TCPY and 1N were associated with reduced testosterone levels  (A3198, A3199).
