Name: Palladium Chloride
Text:
Palladium chloride appears as dark brown crystals. (NTP, 1992)
Palladium(II) chloride is a palladium coordination entity consisting of palladium(II) bound to two chlorine atoms. It has a role as a catalyst.
Palladium(II) chloride is a chloride of palladium. It is a common starting material in palladium chemistry. Palladium(II) chloride is sometimes used to test for the corrosion-resistance of stainless steel and can be found in carbon monoxide detectors. Palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Pd and an atomic number of 46. It is found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum group metals and in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite. (L794, A30)
