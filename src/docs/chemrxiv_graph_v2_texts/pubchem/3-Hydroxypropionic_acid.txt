Name: 3-Hydroxypropionic acid
Text:
3-hydroxypropionic acid is a 3-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid in which one of the hydrogens attached to the terminal carbon is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a 3-hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and an omega-hydroxy-short-chain fatty acid. It is functionally related to a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-hydroxypropionate.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid has been reported in Phomopsis phaseoli, Drosophila melanogaster, and other organisms with data available.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid is a carboxylic acid. It is used in the production of various chemicals such as acrylates in industry. It can be produced by certain microbes. Its chemical structure is similar to L-serine.
