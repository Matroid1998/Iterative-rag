Name: Deuterium
Text:
Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen but it is chemically identical. It is a colorless, odorless gas. It is easily ignited. Once ignited it burns with a pale blue, almost invisible flame. The vapors are lighter than air. It is flammable over a wide range of vapor/air concentrations. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. It is not toxic but is a simple asphyxiate by the displacement of oxygen in the air.
Dideuterium is a dihydrogen.
The stable isotope of hydrogen. It has one neutron and one proton in the nucleus.
