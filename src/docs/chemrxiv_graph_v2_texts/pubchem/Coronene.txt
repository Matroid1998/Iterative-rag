Name: Coronene
Text:
Coronene is a ortho- and peri-fused polycyclic arene that consists of six peri-fused benzene rings.
Coronene  is one of over 100 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning organic substances, such as fossil fuels. They are usually found as a mixture containing two or more of these compounds. (L10)
