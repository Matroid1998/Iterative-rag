Name: Poloxamer
Text:
Poloxamer is an epoxide.
Poloxamer is a non-ionic triblock copolymer comprised of a hydrophobic core of polyoxypropylene flanked by two hydrophilic side chains of polyoxyethylene, that may be used as a fixative and as solubilizer, emulsifier and stabilizer in drug delivery systems.
A nonionic polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block co-polymer with the general formula HO(C2H4O)a(-C3H6O)b(C2H4O)aH. It is available in different grades which vary from liquids to solids. It is used as an emulsifying agent, solubilizing agent, surfactant, and wetting agent for antibiotics. Poloxamer is also used in ointment and suppository bases and as a tablet binder or coater.
