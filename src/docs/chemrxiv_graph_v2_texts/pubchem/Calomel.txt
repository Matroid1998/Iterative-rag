Dimercury dichloride is a mercury coordination entity.
Calomel is a mineral with formula of HgCl. The IMA symbol is Clo.
Mercury(I) chloride is a chloride of mercury that occurs naturally as the mineral calomel. It is used primarily for reference electrodes in electrochemistry. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block metal and one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure. It is a naturally occuring substance, and combines with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen to form inorganic mercury compounds (salts). Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds. (L1, L429)
