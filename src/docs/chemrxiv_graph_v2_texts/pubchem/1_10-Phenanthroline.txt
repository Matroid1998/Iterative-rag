Name: 1,10-Phenanthroline
Text:
1,10-phenanthroline is a phenanthroline. It has a role as an EC 3.4.19.3 (pyroglutamyl-peptidase I) inhibitor and an EC 2.7.1.1 (hexokinase) inhibitor.
Phenanthroline is a heterocyclic organic compound. 1,10-Phenanthroline is an inhibitor of metallopeptidases, especially carboxypeptidase A. Inhibition of the enzyme occurs by removal and chelation of the metal ion required for catalytic activity, leaving an inactive apoenzyme. 1,10-Phenanthroline targets mainly zinc metallopeptidases, with a much lower affinity for calcium metallopeptidases.
