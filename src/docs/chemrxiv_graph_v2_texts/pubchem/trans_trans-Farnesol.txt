Name: trans,trans-Farnesol
Text:
Farnesol is a farnesane sesquiterpenoid that is dodeca-2,6,10-triene substituted by methyl groups at positions 3, 7 and 11 and a hydroxy group at position 1. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a fungal metabolite and an antimicrobial agent. It is a farnesane sesquiterpenoid, a primary alcohol and a polyprenol.
trans,trans-Farnesol has been reported in Humulus lupulus, Pinus densiflora, and other organisms with data available.
(2-trans,6-trans)-Farnesol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A colorless liquid extracted from oils of plants such as citronella, neroli, cyclamen, and tuberose. It is an intermediate step in the biological synthesis of cholesterol from mevalonic acid in vertebrates. It has a delicate odor and is used in perfumery.
