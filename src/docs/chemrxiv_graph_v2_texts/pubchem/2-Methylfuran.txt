Name: 2-Methylfuran
Text:
2-methylfuran appears as a clear colorless liquid with an ethereal odor. Flash point -22 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors heavier than air.
2-methylfuran is a member of the class of furans that is furan in which the hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a methyl group. It has a role as a human urinary metabolite, a hepatotoxic agent, a fuel, a flavouring agent and a plant metabolite. It is a member of furans and a volatile organic compound.
2-Methylfuran has been reported in Fusarium poae, Panax ginseng, and other organisms with data available.
