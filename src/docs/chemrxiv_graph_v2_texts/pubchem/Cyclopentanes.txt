Name: Cyclopentanes
Text:
Cyclopentane appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor. Flash point of -35 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors are heavier than air.
Cyclopentane is a cycloalkane that consists of five carbons each bonded with two hydrogens above and below the plane. The parent of the class of cyclopentanes. It has a role as a non-polar solvent. It is a member of cyclopentanes, a cycloalkane and a volatile organic compound.
Cyclopentane has been reported in Oryza sativa and Senna sophera with data available.
Cyclopentane is a cyclic hydrocarbon. It is a component of gasoline and is used in the manufacture of synthetic resins and rubber adhesives, and also as a blowing agent in the manufacture of polyurethane insulating foam. (L1298)
