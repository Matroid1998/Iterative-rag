Name: Sparteine
Text:
Sparteine is a quinolizidine alkaloid and a quinolizidine alkaloid fundamental parent.
Sparteine is a plant alkaloid derived from Cytisus scoparius and Lupinus mutabilis which may chelate calcium and magnesium. It is a sodium channel blocker, so it falls in the category of class 1a antiarrhythmic agents. Sparteine is not currently FDA-approved for human use, and its salt, sparteine sulfate, is one of the products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market for reasons of safety or effectiveness.
Sparteine has been reported in Thermopsis lanceolata, Anabasis aphylla, and other organisms with data available.
SPARTEINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and is indicated for cardiac arrhythmia.
A quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from several FABACEAE including LUPINUS; SPARTIUM; and CYTISUS. It has been used as an oxytocic and an anti-arrhythmia agent. It has also been of interest as an indicator of CYP2D6 genotype.
