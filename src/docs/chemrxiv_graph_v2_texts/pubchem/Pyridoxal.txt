Name: Pyridoxal
Text:
Pyridoxal is a pyridinecarbaldehyde that is pyridine-4-carbaldehyde bearing methyl, hydroxy and hydroxymethyl substituents at positions 2, 3 and 5 respectively. The 4-carboxyaldehyde form of vitamin B6, it is converted into pyridoxal phosphate, a coenzyme for the synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters, sphingolipids and aminolevulinic acid. It has a role as a cofactor, a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a vitamin B6, a pyridinecarbaldehyde, a member of methylpyridines, a monohydroxypyridine and a hydroxymethylpyridine. It is a conjugate base of a pyridoxal(1+).
Pyridoxal is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Pyridoxal has been reported in Daphnia pulex, Glycine max, and other organisms with data available.
PYRIDOXAL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III.
Pyridoxal is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The 4-carboxyaldehyde form of VITAMIN B 6 which is converted to PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE which is a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid.
