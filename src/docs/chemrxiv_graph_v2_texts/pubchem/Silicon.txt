Name: Silicon
Text:
Silicon powder, amorphous appears as a dark brown powder. Insoluble in water and denser than water. Burns readily when exposed to heat or flames, and may be difficult to extinguish. Water may not be effective in extinguishing flames. Used to make computer microchips.
Silicon atom is a carbon group element atom, a nonmetal atom and a metalloid atom.
Silicon is under investigation in clinical trial NCT00103246 (Photodynamic Therapy Using Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 in Treating Patients With Actinic Keratosis, Bowen's Disease, Skin Cancer, or Stage I or Stage II Mycosis Fungoides).
Silicon is a mineral with formula of Si. The corresponding IMA (International Mineralogical Association) number is IMA1982-099. The IMA symbol is Si.
