Name: Isocoumarin
Text:
Isocoumarin is the simplest member of the class of isocoumarins that is 1H-isochromene which is substituted by an oxo group at position 1. It derives from a hydride of a 1H-isochromene.
Isocoumarin has been reported in Streptomyces and Tessmannia densiflora with data available.
Compounds that differ from COUMARINS in having the positions of the ring and ketone oxygens reversed so the keto oxygen is at the 1-position of the molecule.
