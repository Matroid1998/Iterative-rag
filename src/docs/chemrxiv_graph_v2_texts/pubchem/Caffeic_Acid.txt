Name: Caffeic Acid
Text:
Caffeic Acid can cause cancer according to The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid appears as yellow prisms or plates (from chloroform or ligroin) or pale yellow granules. Alkaline solutions turn from yellow to orange. (NTP, 1992)
Caffeic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid that is cinnamic acid in which the phenyl ring is substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3 and 4. It exists in cis and trans forms; the latter is the more common. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an EC 1.13.11.33 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione transferase) inhibitor, an EC 1.13.11.34 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an antioxidant and an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor. It is a hydroxycinnamic acid and a member of catechols.
Caffeic Acid has been reported in Salvia miltiorrhiza, Salvia plebeia, and other organisms with data available.
Caffeic Acid is an orally bioavailable, hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and polyphenol, with potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, caffeic acid acts as an antioxidant and prevents oxidative stress, thereby preventing DNA damage induced by free radicals. Caffeic acid targets and inhibits the histone demethylase (HDM) oncoprotein gene amplified in squamous cell carcinoma 1 (GASC1; JMJD2C; KDM4C) and inhibits cancer cell proliferation. GASC1, a member of the KDM4 subgroup of Jumonji (Jmj) domain-containing proteins, demethylates trimethylated lysine 9 and lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K9 and H3K36), and plays a key role in tumor cell development.
CAFFEIC ACID is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 2 investigational indications.
Caffeic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
