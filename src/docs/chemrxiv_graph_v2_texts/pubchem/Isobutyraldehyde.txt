Name: Isobutyraldehyde
Text:
Isobutyl aldehyde appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pungent odor. Flash point of -40 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors are heavier than air. Used to make other chemicals.
Isobutyraldehyde is a member of the class of propanals that is propanal substituted by a methyl group at position 2. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a member of propanals and a 2-methyl-branched fatty aldehyde.
Isobutyraldehyde has been reported in Angelica gigas, Tuber melanosporum, and other organisms with data available.
isobutyraldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
