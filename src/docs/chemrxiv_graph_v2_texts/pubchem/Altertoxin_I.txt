Name: Altertoxin I
Text:
Dihydroalterperylenol is a naphthalenone.
Altertoxin I has been reported in Alternaria cassiae, Sonneratia alba, and other organisms with data available.
Altertoxin-1 is an altertoxin, which is a mycotoxin of Alternaria fungi. Altertoxins are important contaminants in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, as well as in the ground, on wood or walls. Studies have shown altertoxins to be toxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. In particular, they have been associated with esophageal cancer in humans. (A2977, A2979)
