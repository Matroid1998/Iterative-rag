Name: Boron trifluoride
Text:
Boron trifluoride is a colorless gas with a pungent odor. It is toxic by inhalation. It is soluble in water and slowly hydrolyzed by cold water to give off hydrofluoric acid, a corrosive material. Its vapors are heavier than air. Prolonged exposure of the containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.
Boron trifluoride is a boron fluoride. It has a role as a NMR chemical shift reference compound.
