Name: Calcipotriene
Text:
Calcipotriol is a seco-cholestane that is 26,27-cyclo-9,10-secocholesta-5,7,10,22-tetraene carrying additional hydroxy substituents at positions 1, 3 and 24. It is used (as its hydrate) in combination with betamethasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adult patients. It has a role as a drug allergen and an antipsoriatic. It is a member of cyclopropanes, a secondary alcohol, a triol, a hydroxy seco-steroid and a seco-cholestane.
Calcipotriol (INN) or calcipotriene (USAN) is a sythetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D.
Calcipotriene is a Vitamin D Analog.
Calcipotriene is a synthetic vitamin D derivative usually formulated for topical dermatological use, antipsoriatic Calcipotriene (calcipotriol) competes equally with active 1,25-hydroxy-2D3 (the natural form of vitamin D) for 1,25-hydroxy-2D3 receptors in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. It induces differentiation and suppresses proliferation of keratinocytes, reversing abnormal keratinocyte changes in psoriasis, and leads to normalization of epidermal growth. (NCI04)
CALCIPOTRIENE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1993 and is indicated for psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis and has 10 investigational indications.
Calcipotriol is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a synthetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D.The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well-understood. However, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the Vitamin D receptor, while being less than 1% as active as the calcitriol in regulating calcium metabolism. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kindney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis, and it is thought that the binding of calcipotriol to the VDR modulates the T cells gene transcription of cell differentiation and proliferation related genes.
