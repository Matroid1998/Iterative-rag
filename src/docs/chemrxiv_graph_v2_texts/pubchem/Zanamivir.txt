Name: Zanamivir
Text:
Zanamivir is a member of guanidines. It has a role as an EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-alpha-sialidase) inhibitor and an antiviral agent.
A guanido-neuraminic acid that is used to inhibit neuraminidase.
Zanamivir is a Neuraminidase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of zanamivir is as a Neuraminidase Inhibitor.
Zanamivir is an inhibitor of the influenza neuraminidase enzyme and is given by inhalation as therapy and prophylaxis against influenza A and B. Zanamivir has not been associated with clinically apparent liver injury, at least when given by inhalation.
Zanamivir is a sialic acid-analogue neuraminidase inhibitor with antiviral activity. Administered into the respiratory tract by aerosol inhalation, zanamivir selectively binds to and inhibits influenza A and B virus neuraminidase-mediated cleavage of sialic acid residues in host cell membrane-bound glycoprotein receptors for influenza viruses, preventing the release of progeny viruses from host cell surfaces and, so, further viral replication.
ZANAMIVIR is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1999 and is indicated for viral disease and influenza and has 3 investigational indications.
A guanido-neuraminic acid that is used to inhibit NEURAMINIDASE.
