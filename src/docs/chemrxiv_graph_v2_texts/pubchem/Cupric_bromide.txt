Copper(ii) bromide is an odorless black solid. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999)
Copper(II) bromide is a bromide of copper. It is used in photographic processing as an intensifier and as a brominating agent in organic synthesis. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock. (L625, L277, L278, L297)
