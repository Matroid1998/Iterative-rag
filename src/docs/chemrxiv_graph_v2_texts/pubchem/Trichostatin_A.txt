Name: Trichostatin A
Text:
Trichostatin A is an antibiotic antifungal agent, a trichostatin and a hydroxamic acid. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a geroprotector and an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor. It is functionally related to a (R)-trichostatic acid.
trichostatin A has been reported in Streptomyces, Streptomyces sioyaensis, and other organisms with data available.
Trichostatin A is a natural derivative of dienohydroxamic acid isolated from species of the bacterial genus Streptomyces.  Trichostatin A (TSA) reversibly and specifically inhibits histone deacetylases, resulting in hyperacetylation of core histones which modulate chromatin structure.  The increase in histone acetylation promotes selective gene transcription and the inhibition of tumor growth.  This agent is a potent inducer of tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in a variety of transformed cells in culture and in tumor-bearing animals. (NCI04)
TRICHOSTATIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of I and has 1 investigational indication.
