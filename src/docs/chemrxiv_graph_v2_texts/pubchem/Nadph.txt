Name: Nadph
Text:
NADPH is the reduced form of NADP+; used in anabolic reactions, such as lipid and nucleic acid synthesis, which require NADPH as a reducing agent. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite and a cofactor. It is a NAD(P)H and a NADP. It is a conjugate acid of a NADPH(4-).
NADPH is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
NADPH has been reported in Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe with data available.
NADPH is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. A coenzyme composed of ribosylnicotinamide 5'-phosphate (NMN) coupled by pyrophosphate linkage to the 5'-phosphate adenosine 2',5'-bisphosphate. It serves as an electron carrier in a number of reactions, being alternately oxidized (NADP+) and reduced (NADPH). (Dorland, 27th ed)
