Name: Nickelocene
Text:
Nickelocene can cause cancer according to California Labor Code.
Nickelocene is a dark liquid in an 8-10% solution in toluene. Insoluble in water. (NTP, 1992)
Nickelocene is a dark green colored, crystalline, inorganic compound that produces toxic gases upon heating. Nickelocene is used as a catalyst and as a complexing agent. Exposure to this substance can cause severe dermatitis, skin and asthma-like allergies and affects the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and neurological system. Nickelocene is a known carcinogen and is associated with an increased risk of developing lung and nasal cancers. (NCI05)
