Name: Lead iodide
Text:
Lead iodide appears as a yellow crystalline solid. Insoluble in water and denser than water. Primary hazard is threat to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit spread to the environment. Used in printing and photography, to seed clouds and other uses.
Lead iodide is a iodide of lead that varies in color from yellow to red, depending of the temperature. It is formed by mixing by mixing lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide. It is used as a detector material for high energy photons including x-rays and gamma rays. Lead is a heavy metal and stable element with the symbol Pb and the atomic number 82, existing in metallic, organic, and inorganic forms. It is mainly found in nature as the mineral galena (PbS), cerussite (PbCO3) or anglesite (PbSO4), usually in ore with zinc, silver, or copper. (A17, L410)
