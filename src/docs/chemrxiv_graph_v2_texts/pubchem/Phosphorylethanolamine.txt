Name: Phosphorylethanolamine
Text:
O-phosphoethanolamine is the ethanolamine mono-ester of phosphoric acid, and a metabolite of phospholipid metabolism. This phosphomonoester shows strong structural similarity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and is decreased in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain. It has a role as a human metabolite, an algal metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a phosphoethanolamine and a primary amino compound. It is a conjugate acid of an O-phosphonatoethanaminium(1-).
O-Phosphoethanolamine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
2-Aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate has been reported in Drosophila melanogaster, Psychotria punctata, and other organisms with data available.
Phosphorylethanolamine is a monophosphate ethanolamine ester that is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sphingomyelins.
PHOSPHORYLETHANOLAMINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II and has 1 investigational indication.
