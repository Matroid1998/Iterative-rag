Carbazole appears as white crystals, plates, leaflets or light tan powder. Sublimes readily. Exhibits strong fluorescence and long phosphorescence on exposure to ultraviolet light. (NTP, 1992)
9H-carbazole is a carbazole. It is a tautomer of a 3H-carbazole, a 1H-carbazole, an 8aH-carbazole and a 4aH-carbazole.
Carbazole has been reported in Glycosmis pentaphylla, Streptomyces, and other organisms with data available.
