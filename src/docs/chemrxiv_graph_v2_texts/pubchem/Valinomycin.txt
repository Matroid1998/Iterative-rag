Shiny crystalline solid. Used as an insecticide and nematocide. Not registered as a pesticide in the U.S. (EPA, 1998)
Valinomycin is a twelve-membered cyclodepsipeptide composed of three repeating D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleryl-D-valyl-L-lactoyl-L-valyl units joined in sequence. An antibiotic found in several Streptomyces strains. It has a role as an antiviral agent, an antimicrobial agent, a potassium ionophore and a bacterial metabolite. It is a cyclodepsipeptide and a macrocycle.
A cyclododecadepsipeptide ionophore antibiotic produced by Streptomyces fulvissimus and related to the enniatins. It is composed of 3 moles each of L-valine, D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid, D-valine, and L-lactic acid linked alternately to form a 36-membered ring. (From Merck Index, 11th ed) Valinomycin is a potassium selective ionophore and is commonly used as a tool in biochemical studies.
Valinomicin has been reported in Streptomyces tsusimaensis, Streptomyces levoris, and other organisms with data available.
Valinomycin is a cyclic depsipeptide isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces fulvissimus.  As a potassium-specific ionophore, mould element causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby initiating cellular apoptosis. (NCI04)
