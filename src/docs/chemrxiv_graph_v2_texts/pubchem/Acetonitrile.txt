Name: Acetonitrile
Text:
Acetonitrile appears as a colorless limpid liquid with an aromatic odor. Flash point 42 Â°F. Density 0.783 g / cm3. Toxic by skin absorption. Less dense than water. Vapors are denser than air.
Acetonitrile is a nitrile that is hydrogen cyanide in which the hydrogen has been replaced by a methyl group. It has a role as a polar aprotic solvent, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an aliphatic nitrile and a volatile organic compound.
Acetonitrile has many uses, including as a solvent, for spinning fibers, and in lithium batteries. It is primarily found in air from automobile exhaust and manufacturing facilities. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure results in irritation of mucous membranes. Chronic (long-term) exposure results in central nervous system effects, such as headaches, numbness, and tremors. No data are available on its carcinogenic effects in humans; EPA has classified it as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.
Acetonitrile is a chemical compound of cyanide.
