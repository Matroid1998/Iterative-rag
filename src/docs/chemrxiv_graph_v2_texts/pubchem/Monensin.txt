Name: Monensin
Text:
Monensin A is a spiroketal, monensin A is the major component of monensin, a mixture of antibiotic substances produced by Streptomyces cinnamonensis. An antiprotozoal, it is used as the sodium salt as a feed additive for the prevention of coccidiosis in poultry and as a growth promoter in cattle. It has a role as a coccidiostat, an antifungal agent and an ionophore. It is a monocarboxylic acid, a cyclic hemiketal, a spiroketal and a polyether antibiotic.
Monensin is a polyether isolated from Streptomyces cinnamonensis that presents antibiotic properties. It is widely used in ruminant animal feeds.
Monensin has been reported in Streptomyces glaucescens and Apis cerana with data available.
MONENSIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
An antiprotozoal agent produced by Streptomyces cinnamonensis. It exerts its effect during the development of first-generation trophozoites into first-generation schizonts within the intestinal epithelial cells. It does not interfere with hosts' development of acquired immunity to the majority of coccidial species. Monensin is a sodium and proton selective ionophore and is widely used as such in biochemical studies.
