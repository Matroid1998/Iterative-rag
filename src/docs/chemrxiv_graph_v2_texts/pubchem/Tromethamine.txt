Name: Tromethamine
Text:
Tris is a primary amino compound that is tert-butylamine in which one hydrogen attached to each methyl group is replaced by a hydroxy group. A compound widely used as a biological buffer substance in the pH range 7--9; pKa = 8.3 at 20 ℃; pKa = 7.82 at 37 ℃. It has a role as a buffer. It is a triol and a primary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a member of Htris.
An organic amine proton acceptor. It is used in the synthesis of surface-active agents and pharmaceuticals; as an emulsifying agent for cosmetic creams and lotions, mineral oil and paraffin wax emulsions, as a biological buffer, and used as an alkalizer.
