Name: Tetraethylene Glycol
Text:
Tetraethylene glycol is a colorless to straw-colored liquid with a mild odor. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999)
Tetraethylene glycol is a poly(ethylene glycol).
Tetraethylene glycol is an industrial solvent/chemical with a higher boiling point and lower volatility than the lower ethylene glycols. It is especially useful in polyester resins and as a plasticizer. Tetraethylene glycol is also used as a chemical intermediate and as a solvent in the production of inks and dyes. Tetraethylene glycol is often used as a process solvent in hydrocarbon purification processes and as a coupling agent in the production of textile lubricants and formulations.
