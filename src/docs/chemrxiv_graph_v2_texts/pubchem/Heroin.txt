Name: Heroin
Text:
Heroin is a morphinane alkaloid that is morphine bearing two acetyl substituents on the O-3 and O-6 positions. As with other opioids, heroin is used as both an analgesic and a recreational drug. Frequent and regular administration is associated with tolerance and physical dependence, which may develop into addiction. Its use includes treatment for acute pain, such as in severe physical trauma, myocardial infarction, post-surgical pain, and chronic pain, including end-stage cancer and other terminal illnesses. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and a prodrug. It is functionally related to a morphine.
Heroin is a DEA Schedule I controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule I have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse. It is a Opium derivatives substance.
Diamorphine (heroin) is a narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming.
