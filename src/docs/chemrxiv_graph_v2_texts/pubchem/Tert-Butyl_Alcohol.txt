Text:
Tert-butyl alcohol is a colorless oily liquid with a sharp alcohol odor. Floats and mixes with water. Produces irritating vapor. Freezing point is 78 Â°F. (USCG, 1999)
Tert-butanol is a tertiary alcohol alcohol that is isobutane substituted by a hydroxy group at position 2. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite. It derives from a hydride of an isobutane.
tert-Butanol has been reported in Psidium guajava with data available.
An isomer of butanol that contains a tertiary butyl group that consists of three methyl groups, each separately attached to a central (tertiary) carbon.
