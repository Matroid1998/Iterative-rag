Name: Paricalcitol
Text:
Paricalcitol is a seco-cholestane and a hydroxy seco-steroid. It has a role as an antiparathyroid drug. It is functionally related to a vitamin D2.
Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog. Paricalcitol has been used to reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.
Paricalcitol is a Vitamin D2 Analog and Vitamin D Analog.
Paricalcitol is a synthetic noncalcemic, nonphosphatemic vitamin D analogue.  Paricalcitol binds to the vitamin D receptor and has been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This agent also increases the expression of PTEN ('Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten'), a tumor-suppressor gene, in leukemic cells and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis and tumor cell differentiation into normal phenotypes. (NCI04)
PARICALCITOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1998 and has 3 approved and 18 investigational indications.
