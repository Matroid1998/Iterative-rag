Name: 1,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin
Text:
1,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is an organobromide compound derived from the heterocycle called dimethylhydantoin. It is widely used as a disinfectant used for drinking water purification, recreational water treatment, as a bleaching agent in pulp and paper mills, and for treating industrial/commercial water cooling systems. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock. (L625, L690)
