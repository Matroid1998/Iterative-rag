Name: Hydroxylamine
Text:
Hydroxylamine is an odorless white crystalline solid. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999)
Hydroxylamine is the simplest hydroxylamine, consisting of ammonia bearing a hydroxy substituent. It is an intermediate in the biological nitrification by microbes like bacteria. It has a role as a nitric oxide donor, an EC 1.1.3.13 (alcohol oxidase) inhibitor, a nucleophilic reagent, an EC 4.2.1.22 (cystathionine beta-synthase) inhibitor, an EC 4.3.1.10 (serine-sulfate ammonia-lyase) inhibitor, a bacterial xenobiotic metabolite and an algal metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a hydroxyazanide and an aminooxidanide. It derives from a hydride of an ammonia.
Hydroxylamine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Hydroxylamine has been reported in Lotus burttii, Lotus tenuis, and other organisms with data available.
A colorless inorganic compound (HONH2) used in organic synthesis and as a reducing agent, due to its ability to donate nitric oxide.
