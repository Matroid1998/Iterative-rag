Name: Enterobactin
Text:
Enterobactin is a macrotriolide produced by certain members of Enterobacteriaceae, e.g. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite and a siderophore. It is a crown compound, a member of catechols, a polyphenol and a macrotriolide. It is a conjugate acid of an enterobactin(6-) and an enterobactin(1-).
Enterochelin is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Enterobactin has been reported in Streptomyces wadayamensis, Bos taurus, and Streptomyces albidoflavus with data available.
An iron-binding cyclic trimer of 2,3-dihydroxy-N-benzoyl-L-serine. It is produced by E COLI and other enteric bacteria.
