Name: Phenylthiourea

Needle-like crystals. Used in the manufacture of rodenticides and in medical genetics. (EPA, 1998)
N-phenylthiourea is a member of the class of thioureas that is thiourea in which one of the hydrogens is replaced by a phenyl group. Depending on their genetic makeup, humans find it either very bitter-tasting or tasteless. This unusual property resulted in N-phenylthiourea being used in paternity testing prior to the advent of DNA testing. It has a role as an EC 1.14.18.1 (tyrosinase) inhibitor. It is functionally related to a thiourea.
Phenylthiourea is a THIOUREA derivative containing a phenyl ring. Depending on their genetic makeup, humans can find it either bitter-tasting or tasteless.
