Lead(II) fluoride is a fluoride of lead. It is used in certain types of glass, in phosphors for television-tube screens, and as a catalyst for the manufacture of picoline. Lead is a heavy metal and stable element with the symbol Pb and the atomic number 82, existing in metallic, organic, and inorganic forms. It is mainly found in nature as the mineral galena (PbS), cerussite (PbCO3) or anglesite (PbSO4), usually in ore with zinc, silver, or copper. (L21, L401)
