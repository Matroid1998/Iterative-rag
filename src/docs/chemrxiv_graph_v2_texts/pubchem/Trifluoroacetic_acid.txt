Name: Trifluoroacetic acid
Text:
Trifluoroacetic acid appears as a colorless fuming liquid with a pungent odor. Soluble in water and denser than water. Corrosive to skin, eyes and mucous membranes. Used to make other chemicals and as a solvent.
Trifluoroacetic acid is a monocarboxylic acid that is the trifluoro derivative of acetic acid. It has a role as a reagent, a human xenobiotic metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is functionally related to an acetic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a trifluoroacetate.
A very strong halogenated derivative of acetic acid. It is used in acid catalyzed reactions, especially those where an ester is cleaved in peptide synthesis.
