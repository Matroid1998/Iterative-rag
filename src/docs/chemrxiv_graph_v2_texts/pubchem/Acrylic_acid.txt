Name: Acrylic acid
Text:
Acrylic acid is a alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid that is ethene substituted by a carboxy group. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an acrylate.
A α,β-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid that is ethene substituted by a carboxy group.
Acrylic acid is used in the manufacture of plastics, paint formulations, and other products. Exposure occurs primarily in the workplace. It is a strong irritant to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes in humans. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of acrylic acid in humans. Animal cancer studies have reported both positive and negative results. EPA has not classified acrylic acid for carcinogenicity.
Acrylic acid has been reported in Cocos nucifera, Gynerium sagittatum, and other organisms with data available.
