Name: Bisdemethoxycurcumin
Text:
Bisdemethoxycurcumin is a beta-diketone that is methane in which two of the hydrogens are substituted by 4-hydroxycinnamoyl groups. It has a role as a metabolite and an EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-amylase) inhibitor. It is a beta-diketone, a polyphenol, an enone and a diarylheptanoid. It is functionally related to a 4-coumaric acid.
Bisdemethoxycurcumin has been reported in Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Curcuma kwangsiensis, and other organisms with data available.
