Name: Nogalamycin
Text:
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces nogalater. It is a DNA intercalator and exhibits anticancer properties. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a cardiotoxic agent, a bacterial metabolite and an intercalator. It is a methyl ester, a polyketide, an anthracycline antibiotic, a tertiary amino compound, a monosaccharide derivative, an organic heterohexacyclic compound and a tetrol.
Nogalamycin is an anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces nogalater.  Nogalamycin intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase I, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. (NCI04)
An anthrocycline from a Streptomyces nogalater variant. It is a cytolytic antineoplastic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by binding to DNA.
