Name: Purine Nucleosides
Text:
Nebularine is a purine ribonucleoside that is 9H-purine attached to a beta-D-ribofuranosyl residue at position 9 via a glycosidic (N-glycosyl) linkage. It has a role as a fungal metabolite. It is a purine ribonucleoside and a purines D-ribonucleoside. It is functionally related to a beta-D-ribose.
Purine nucleoside is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Nebularine has been reported in Phellinus igniarius, Medicago sativa, and other organisms with data available.
