Salicylaldehyde is a hydroxybenzaldehyde carrying a hydroxy substituent at position 2. It has a role as a nematicide and a plant metabolite.
Salicylaldehyde has been reported in Decalepis hamiltonii, Cinnamomum sieboldii, and other organisms with data available.
2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is found in common buckwheat. 2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is present in cinnamon (Cinnamomum versum). 2-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is a flavouring ingredient.
