Name: Isobutyl alcohol
Text:
Isobutanol appears as a clear colorless liquid with a sweet odor. Flash point 85 - 100 Â°F. Less dense than water. Vapors heavier than air.
Isobutanol is an alkyl alcohol that is propan-1-ol substituted by a methyl group at position 2. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite. It is a primary alcohol and an alkyl alcohol. It derives from a hydride of an isobutane.
Isobutanol has been reported in Angelica gigas, Tuber melanosporum, and other organisms with data available.
isobutanol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
