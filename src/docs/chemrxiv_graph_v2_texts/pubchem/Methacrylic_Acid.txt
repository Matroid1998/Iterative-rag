Name: Methacrylic Acid
Text:
Methacrylic acid appears as a clear colorless liquid (or low-melting solid) with a pungent odor. Corrosive to metals and tissue. Flash point 170 째F. Melting point 61 째F. May polymerize exothermically if heated or contaminated. If the polymerization takes place inside a container, the container may rupture violently. Less dense than water. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make plastics.
Methacrylic acid, stabilized appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pungent odor. Corrosive to metals and tissue. Combustible. Flash point 170 째F. Melting point 61 째F. May polymerize if contaminated or heated. If polymerization takes place inside a closed container, the container may violently rupture. Less dense than water and is soluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make plastics.
Methacrylic acid is an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid that is acrylic acid in which the hydrogen at position 2 is substituted by a methyl group. It is functionally related to an acrylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a methacrylate.
Methacrylic acid has been reported in Scarites subterraneus, Euryops arabicus, and Coffea arabica with data available.
