Name: Dibenzothiophene
Text:
Dibenzothiophene is a mancude organic heterotricyclic parent that consists of a thiophene ring flanked by two benzene rings ortho-fused across the 2,3- and 4,5-positions. It has a role as a keratolytic drug. It is a member of dibenzothiophenes and a mancude organic heterotricyclic parent.
Dibenzothiophene has been reported in Rosa with data available.
Dibenzothiophene is a sulfur-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivate consisting of 3 fused rings with keratolytic activity. Dibenzothiophene is a component of petroleum oils.
