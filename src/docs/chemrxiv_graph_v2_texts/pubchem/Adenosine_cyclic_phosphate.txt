Name: Adenosine cyclic phosphate
Text:
3',5'-cyclic AMP is a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide having having adenine as the nucleobase. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an adenyl ribonucleotide and a 3',5'-cyclic purine nucleotide. It is a conjugate acid of a 3',5'-cyclic AMP(1-).
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP or 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a molecule that is important in many biological processes; it is derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Cyclic AMP is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Cyclic AMP has been reported in Ziziphus jujuba, Secale cereale, and other organisms with data available.
Cyclic AMP is a second messenger molecule comprised of an adenine ribonucleotide bearing a phosphate group bound to the oxygen molecules at the 3' and 5' positions of the sugar moiety. Cyclic AMP, which is synthesized from ATP by the intracellular enzyme adenylate cyclase, modulates the activity of several hormone-dependent signal transduction pathways.
3',5'-cyclic AMP is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
An adenine nucleotide containing one phosphate group which is esterified to both the 3'- and 5'-positions of the sugar moiety. It is a second messenger and a key intracellular regulator, functioning as a mediator of activity for a number of hormones, including epinephrine, glucagon, and ACTH.
