Name: Clopidogrel Bisulfate
Text:
Clopidogrel Bisulfate is a thienopyridine with antiplatelet activity. Clopidogrel bisulfate irreversibly alters the platelet receptor for adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thereby blocking the binding of ADP to its receptor, inhibiting ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein complex GPIIb/IIIa, and inhibiting fibrinogen binding to platelets and platelet adhesion and aggregation. (NCI04)
CLOPIDOGREL BISULFATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1997 and has 6 approved and 4 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA.
A ticlopidine analog and platelet purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist that inhibits adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLATELET AGGREGATION. It is used to prevent THROMBOEMBOLISM in patients with ARTERIAL OCCLUSIVE DISEASES; MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION; STROKE; or ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.
