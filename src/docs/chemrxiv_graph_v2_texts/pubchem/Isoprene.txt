Isoprene can cause cancer according to The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
Isoprene is a hemiterpene with the formula CH2=C(CH3)CH=CH2; the monomer of natural rubber and a common structure motif to the isoprenoids, a large class of other naturally occurring compounds. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is an alkadiene, a hemiterpene and a volatile organic compound.
Isoprene has been reported in Vernonia fasciculata, Humulus lupulus, and other organisms with data available.
Natural Rubber is the natural extract of tropical rubber plants.
Isoprene is an unsaturated pentahydrocarbon, Isoprene is found in certain plants or obtained by distillation of caoutchouc or gutta-percha. In plants, it is elementary in the formation of isoprenoids, fat-soluble vitamins, carotenoids and related pigments. Isoprenes contribute to flavors and fragrances of essential oils and other plant-derived substances. (NCI04)
