Name: Deoxyguanosine
Text:
2'-deoxyguanosine is a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside having guanine as the nucleobase. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a purines 2'-deoxy-D-ribonucleoside and a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside. It is functionally related to a guanosine.
Deoxyguanosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
2'-Deoxyguanosine has been reported in Daphnia pulex, Glycine max, and other organisms with data available.
Deoxyguanosine is a purine nucleoside comprised of a guanine bound to the 1' position of deoxyribose. Phosphorylated forms of deoxyguanosine are substrates for DNA synthesis.
2'-Deoxyguanosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A nucleoside consisting of the base guanine and the sugar deoxyribose.
