Name: Clomazone
Text:
Clomazone is an isoxazolidinone that is 1,2-oxazolidin-3-one substituted by a 2-chlorobenzyl group at position 2 and two methyl groups at position 4. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a herbicide, an agrochemical and a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitor. It is a member of monochlorobenzenes and an isoxazolidinone.
Clomazone, a white solid compound, is an agricultural herbicide, and has been the active ingredient of products named. The molecule consists of a 2-chlorobenzyl group bound to a N-O heterocycle called Isoxazole.
