Name: Indacaterol
Text:
Indacaterol is a monohydroxyquinoline that consists of 5-[(1R)-2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl]-8-hydroxyquinolin-2-one having a 5,6-diethylindan-2-yl group attached to the amino function. Used as the maleate salt for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic agonist and a bronchodilator agent. It is a quinolone, a monohydroxyquinoline, a member of indanes, a secondary alcohol and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of an indacaterol(1+).
Indacaterol is a novel, ultra-long-acting, rapid onset Î²(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for Novartis for the once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 30 November 2009 and by the FDA on 1 July 2011. It is marketed in Europe as Onbrez and in America as Arcapta Neohaler. Indacaterol is provided as its maleate salt form. Indacaterol is also a chiral molecule but only the pure R-enantiomer is dispensed.
Indacaterol is a beta2-Adrenergic Agonist. The mechanism of action of indacaterol is as an Adrenergic beta2-Agonist.
INDACATEROL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2009 and has 4 approved and 4 investigational indications.
