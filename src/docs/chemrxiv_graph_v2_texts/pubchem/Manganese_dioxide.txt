Name: Manganese dioxide
Text:
Manganese dioxide is a manganese molecular entity with formula MnO2. It is a manganese molecular entity and a metal oxide.
Manganese dioxide has been reported in Allium sativum with data available.
Manganese dioxide is an oxide of manganese that occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite,  the main ore of manganese. It is used primarily for dry-cell batteries, but is also used as an  oxidant in organic synthesis. Manganese is a naturally occurring metal with the symbol Mn and the atomic number 25. It does not occur naturally in its pure form, but is found in many types of rocks in combination with other substances such as oxygen, sulfur, or chlorine. Manganese occurs naturally in most foods and small amounts are needed to stay healthy, as manganese ions act as cofactors for a number of enzymes. (L228, L229, L232)
