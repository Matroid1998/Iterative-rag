Name: Pregnandiol
Text:
Pregnanediol is a corticosteroid hormone. It is a tautomer of a 5beta-pregnane-3beta,20alpha-diol.
An inactive metabolite of PROGESTERONE by reduction at C5, C3, and C20 position. Pregnanediol has two hydroxyl groups, at 3-alpha and 20-alpha. It is detectable in URINE after OVULATION and is found in great quantities in the pregnancy urine.
