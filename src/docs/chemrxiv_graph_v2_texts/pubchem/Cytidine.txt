Name: Cytidine
Text:
Cytidine is a white crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992)
Cytidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside in which cytosine is attached to ribofuranose via a beta-N(1)-glycosidic bond. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is functionally related to a cytosine.
Cytidine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Cytidine has been reported in Castanopsis fissa, Fritillaria thunbergii, and other organisms with data available.
Cytidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside comprised of a cytosine bound to ribose via a beta-N1-glycosidic bond. Cytidine is a precursor for uridine. Both cytidine and uridine are utilized in RNA synthesis.
CYTIDINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 5 investigational indications.
Cytidine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A pyrimidine nucleoside that is composed of the base CYTOSINE linked to the five-carbon sugar D-RIBOSE.
