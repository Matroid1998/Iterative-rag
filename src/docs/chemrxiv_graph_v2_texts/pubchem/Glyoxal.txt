Name: Glyoxal
Text:
Glyoxal appears as yellow crystals melting at15 Â°C. Hence often encountered as a light yellow liquid with a weak sour odor. Vapor has a green color and burns with a violet flame.
Glyoxal is the dialdehyde that is the smallest possible and which consists of ethane having oxo groups on both carbons. It has a role as a pesticide, an agrochemical, an allergen and a plant growth regulator.
Glyoxal has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and Sesamum indicum with data available.
A 2-carbon aldehyde with carbonyl groups on both carbons.
