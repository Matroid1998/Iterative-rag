Name: Succinic anhydride
Text:
Succinic anhydride appears as colorless needles or white crystalline solid. Melting point 237 °F. Sublimes at 239 °F at 5 mmHg pressure; and at 198 °F and 1 mmHg pressure. Moderately toxic and an irritant.
Succinic anhydride is a cyclic dicarboxylic anhydride and a tetrahydrofurandione. It is functionally related to a succinic acid.
Succinic anhydride has been reported in Clerodendrum japonicum, Nicotiana tabacum, and other organisms with data available.
