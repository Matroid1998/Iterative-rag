Name: Allyl alcohol
Text:
Allyl alcohol appears as a clear colorless liquid with a mustard-like odor. Flash point 70 Â°F. Very toxic by inhalation and ingestion. Less dense than water (7.1 lb / gal). Vapors are heavier than air. Prolonged exposure to low concentrations or short exposure to high concentrations may have adverse health effects from inhalation.
Allyl alcohol is a propenol in which the C=C bond connects C-2 and C-3. It is has been found in garlic (Allium sativum). Formerly used as a herbicide for the control of various grass and weed seeds. It has a role as an insecticide, a herbicide, an antibacterial agent, a fungicide and a plant metabolite. It is a primary allylic alcohol and a propenol.
Allyl alcohol has been reported in Bos taurus, Allium sativum, and Vitis vinifera with data available.
