Name: Cellulose nitrate
Text:
Nitrocellulose is a (1->4)-beta-D-glucan compound formed by nitrating cellulose through exposure to nitric acid or another powerful nitrating agent. It has a role as a tissue adhesive and an explosive. It is functionally related to a (1->4)-beta-D-glucan.
A nitrocellulose solution in ether and alcohol. Collodion has a wide range of uses in industry including applications in the manufacture of photographic film, in fibers, in lacquers, and in engraving and lithography. In medicine it is used as a drug solvent and a wound sealant.
