Name: 1,3-Dinitrobenzene
Text:
m-Dinitrobenzene can cause male reproductive toxicity according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Dinitrobenzene is a white or yellow crystalline solid or dissolved in a liquid carrier. It is insoluble in water. It is toxic by skin absorption and by inhalation (dust, etc.). It is combustible. Exposure of the confined material to fire or heat or shock may result in the spontaneous decomposition of the material with a resultant explosion. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.
M-dinitrobenzene is a yellow solid with a slight odor. Sinks in water. (USCG, 1999)
1,3-dinitrobenzene is a dinitrobenzene that is benzene disubstituted at positions 1 and 3 with nitro groups. It has a role as a neurotoxin.
