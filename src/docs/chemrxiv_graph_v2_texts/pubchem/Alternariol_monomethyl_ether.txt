Name: Alternariol monomethyl ether
Text:
Djalonensone is a benzochromenone that is alternariol in which the hydroxy group at position 9 has been converted into the corresponding methyl ether. A natural product found in Chaetomium globosum as well as being one of the two most important compounds belonging to the group of Altenaria mycotoxins. It has a role as an antifungal agent, a fungal metabolite and a mycotoxin. It is a benzochromenone and an aromatic ether. It is functionally related to an alternariol.
Alternariol monomethyl ether has been reported in Alternaria porri, Sarocladium strictum, and other organisms with data available.
Alternariol methyl ether is an altertoxin, which is a mycotoxin of Alternaria fungi. Altertoxins are important contaminants in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, as well as in the ground, on wood or walls. Studies have shown altertoxins to be toxic, genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. In particular, they have been associated with esophageal cancer in humans. (A2977, A2979)
