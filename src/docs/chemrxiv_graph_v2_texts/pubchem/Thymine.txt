Name: Thymine
Text:
Thymine is a pyrimidine nucleobase that is uracil in which the hydrogen at position 5 is replaced by a methyl group. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a pyrimidine nucleobase and a pyrimidone.
Thymine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Thymine has been reported in Phomopsis velata, Huperzia serrata, and other organisms with data available.
Thymine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
One of four constituent bases of DNA.
