Name: Guanosine
Text:
Guanosine is a purine nucleoside in which guanine is attached to ribofuranose via a beta-N(9)-glycosidic bond. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is a purines D-ribonucleoside and a member of guanosines. It is functionally related to a guanine.
Guanosine is a nucleoside comprising guanine attached to a ribose (ribofuranose) ring via a Î²-N9-glycosidic bond. Guanosine can be phosphorylated to become GMP (guanosine monophosphate), cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate), GDP (guanosine diphosphate) and GTP (guanosine triphosphate) which are factors in signal transduction pathways.
Guanosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Ribonucleoside is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Guanosine has been reported in Daphnia pulex, Sinocrassula indica, and other organisms with data available.
Guanosine is a purine nucleoside formed from a beta-N9-glycosidic bond between guanine and a ribose ring and is essential for metabolism.
Guanosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A purine nucleoside that has guanine linked by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of ribose. It is a component of ribonucleic acid and its nucleotides play important roles in metabolism. (From Dorland, 28th ed)
