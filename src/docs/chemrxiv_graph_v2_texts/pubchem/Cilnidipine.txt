Text:
Cilnidipine is a diesterified 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid. A calcium channel blocker, it is used as an antihypertensive. It has a role as a calcium channel blocker, an antihypertensive agent and a cardiovascular drug. It is a dihydropyridine, a 2-methoxyethyl ester and a C-nitro compound.
Cilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. It was jointly developed by Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company, Japan and Ajinomoto, Japan and approved in 1995. Compared with other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the N-type calcium channel that existing sympathetic nerve end besides acting on L-type calcium channel that similar to most of the calcium antagonists. This drug is approved in China, Japan, Korea, India, and several countries in the European Union.
CILNIDIPINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.
