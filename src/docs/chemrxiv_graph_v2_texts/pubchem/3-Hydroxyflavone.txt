Name: 3-Hydroxyflavone
Text:
Flavonol is a monohydroxyflavone that is the 3-hydroxy derivative of flavone. It is a monohydroxyflavone and a member of flavonols. It is a conjugate acid of a flavonol(1-).
3-Hydroxyflavone has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Humulus lupulus, and other organisms with data available.
Flavonoid is one of a number of chemical compounds found in certain fruits, vegetables and seeds with antioxidant properties and potential antineoplastic properties. As polyphenolic, soluble plant pigments, flavonoids are usually subdivided into 5 subgroups flavonols, flavones, flavonones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanidins.  Although not considered essential nutrients, some flavonoids may be beneficial to health by strengthening and protecting blood vessels and connective tissue and acting as anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic, and antiviral agents.  As antioxidants, some flavonoids may protect lipids from oxidative damage or retard the formation of cataracts. (NCI04)
