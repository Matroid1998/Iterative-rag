Name: Cycloheximide
Text:
Cycloheximide can cause developmental toxicity according to state or federal government labeling requirements.
Cycloheximide appears as colorless crystals. Used as a fungicide and as a anticancer drug. (EPA, 1998)
Cycloheximide is a dicarboximide that is 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperidine-2,6-dione in which one of the hydrogens attached to the carbon bearing the hydroxy group is replaced by a 3,5-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl group. It is an antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces griseus. It has a role as a bacterial metabolite, a protein synthesis inhibitor, a neuroprotective agent, an anticoronaviral agent and a ferroptosis inhibitor. It is a member of piperidones, a piperidine antibiotic, an antibiotic fungicide, a dicarboximide, a secondary alcohol and a cyclic ketone. It is functionally related to a piperidine-2,6-dione.
Cycloheximide has been reported in Streptomyces, Streptomyces pulveraceus, and Streptomyces griseus with data available.
CYCLOHEXIMIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
Antibiotic substance isolated from streptomycin-producing strains of Streptomyces griseus. It acts by inhibiting elongation during protein synthesis.
