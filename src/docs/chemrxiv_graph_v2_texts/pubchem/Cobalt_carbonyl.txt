Name: Cobalt carbonyl
Text:
Cobalt carbonyl appears as orange or dark brown crystalline solid. Used as a catalyst, used in antiknock gasoline and in making high-purity cobalt compounds. (EPA, 1998)
Dicobalt octacarbonyl Co2(CO)8 is a chemical compound of cobalt. This metal carbonyl is a reagent and catalyst in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis [Paulson]. It is used as a catalyst for hydroformylation, the conversion of alkenes into aldehydes [Elschenbroich]. Cobalt is a metallic element with the atomic number 27. It is found naturally in rocks, soil, water, plants, and animals. In small amounts cobalt is an essential element for life, as it is part of vitamin B12. However, excess exposure is known to exhibit toxic effects. (L29, L30)
