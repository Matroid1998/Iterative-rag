Name: 4,4'-Diaminodiphenyl Ether
Text:
4,4'-Diaminodiphenyl ether (4,4'-Oxydianiline) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.
4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether appears as odorless colorless crystals or an odorless fine, beige powder. (NTP, 1992)
4-Aminophenyl ether is an aromatic ether.
4,4-Oxydianiline is a colorless, odorless, combustible aromatic amine that emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition. 4,4'-Oxydianiline is used in industry in the manufacture of polyimide and polyester resins. Exposure to this substance is irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory-tract. 4,4'-Oxydianiline is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
