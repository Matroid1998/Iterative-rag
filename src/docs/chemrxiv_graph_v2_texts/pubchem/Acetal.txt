Name: Acetal
Text:
Acetal appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pleasant odor. Boiling point 103-104 °C. Flash point -5 °F. Density 0.831 g / cm3. Slightly soluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Moderately toxic and narcotic in high concentrations.
1,1-Diethoxyethane is an acetal.
1,1-Diethoxyethane has been reported in Citrus reticulata, Allium ampeloprasum, and other organisms with data available.
1,1-Diethoxy ethane is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Diethers with the structure -C(OR'')(OR'''), where R'' and R''' are not hydrogen. Mixed acetals have R'' and R''' groups which differ.
