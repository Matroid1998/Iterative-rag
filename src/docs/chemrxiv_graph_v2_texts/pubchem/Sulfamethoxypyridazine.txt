Name: Sulfamethoxypyridazine
Text:
Sulfamethoxypyridazine is a sulfonamide consisting of pyridazine having a methoxy substituent at the 6-position and a 4-aminobenzenesulfonamido group at the 3-position. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an EC 2.5.1.15 (dihydropteroate synthase) inhibitor and a drug allergen. It is a member of pyridazines, a sulfonamide and a sulfonamide antibiotic. It is functionally related to a sulfanilamide.
Sulfamethoxypyridazine is a long-acting sulfonamide antibiotic.
SULFAMETHOXYPYRIDAZINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and is indicated for bacterial disease.
A sulfanilamide antibacterial agent.
