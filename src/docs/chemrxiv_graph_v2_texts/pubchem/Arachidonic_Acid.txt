Name: Arachidonic Acid
Text:
Arachidonic acid is a long-chain fatty acid that is a C20, polyunsaturated fatty acid having four (Z)-double bonds at positions 5, 8, 11 and 14. It has a role as a human metabolite, an EC 3.1.1.1 (carboxylesterase) inhibitor, a Daphnia galeata metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is an icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid and a long-chain fatty acid. It is a conjugate acid of an arachidonate. It derives from a hydride of a (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraene.
Arachidonic acid has been reported in Agaricus blazei, Mortierella hygrophila, and other organisms with data available.
Arachidonic Acid is an unsaturated, essential fatty acid. It is found in animal and human fat as well as in the liver, brain, and glandular organs, and is a constituent of animal phosphatides. It is formed by the synthesis from dietary linoleic acid and is a precursor in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes.(ChemID Plus)
