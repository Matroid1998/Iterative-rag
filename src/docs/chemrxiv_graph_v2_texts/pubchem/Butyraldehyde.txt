Text:
Butyraldehyde appears as a clear liquid with a pungent odor. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air.
Butanal is a member of the class of butanals that consists of propane bearing a formyl substituent at the 1-position. The parent of the class of butanals. It has a role as a biomarker, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite.
Butanal is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Butyraldehyde has been reported in Gossypium hirsutum, Ligusticum striatum, and other organisms with data available.
