Name: Stannous Chloride
Text:
Stannous chloride, solid appears as crystalline mass or flaky solid with a fatty appearance. Density 3.95 g / cm3. Melting point 247 Â°C. Burns, but may be difficult to ignite. Toxic by ingestion. Irritates skin and eyes. Used in the manufacture of dyes, pharmaceuticals and as a tanning agent.
Stannous chloride is used as a source of tin in radiopharmaceutical kits. Tin reduces technetium-99m, the active radiological agent, allowing it to form a complex with phosphate-containing moeities. These complexes localize primarily in bone (40-50%) and infracted myocardium (0.01-0.02%/g of tissue) allowing for imaging of areas of altered osteogenesis or necrotic heart tissue.
Tin(II) chloride (SnCl2) is a food additive (antioxidant) e.g. for colour retention in canned vegetables such as asparagus.
