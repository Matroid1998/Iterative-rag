Bromoxynil can cause developmental toxicity according to state or federal government labeling requirements.
Bromoxynil is a colorless solid. Melting point 382-384 째F (194-195 째C). Sublimes at 275 째F (135 째C) under pressure of 0.15 mmHg. Used as a herbicide.
3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile is a dibromobenzene that is 2,6-dibromophenol substituted by a cyano group at position 4. It has a role as an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a herbicide. It is a member of phenols, a dibromobenzene and a hydroxynitrile. It is functionally related to a 2,6-dibromophenol. It is a conjugate acid of a 3,5-dibromo-4-oxidobenzonitrile(1-).
Bromoxynil is a chemical compound of cyanide that is used as a herbicide. It is not permitted for homeowner use and is used for mainly for post-emergent control of annual broadleaf weeds. It is especially effective in the control of weeds in cereal, corn, sorghum, onions, flax, mint, turf, and on non-cropland. It works by inhibiting photosynthesis. (L594)
