Name: Lithium
Text:
Lithium appears as a soft silvery metal that is normally grayish white. Reacts violently with water to form flammable hydrogen gas and strong caustic solution. Ignition usually occurs. Strong (corrosive) alkali fumes are formed in fire. (USCG, 1999)
Lithium atom is an alkali metal atom.
Lithium is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Lithium is a simple alkali metal, the salt of which acts as a mood stabilizing agent which has been extensively used for the treatment of mania for more than 50 years. Lithium has been associated with rare instances of mild serum aminotransferase elevations, but has not been convincingly linked to clinically apparent acute liver injury.
