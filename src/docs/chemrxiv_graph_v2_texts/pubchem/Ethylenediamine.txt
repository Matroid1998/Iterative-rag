Name: Ethylenediamine
Text:
Ethylenediamine appears as a clear colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Flash point of 91 °F and a melting point of 47 °F. Corrosive to tissue. Vapors are heavier than air. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. Density 7.5 lb / gal. Used to make other chemicals and as a fungicide.
Ethylenediamine is an alkane-alpha,omega-diamine in which the alkane is ethane. It has a role as a GABA agonist. It derives from a hydride of an ethane.
Ethylenediamine is an organic compound that is used as a building block for the production of many other chemical products. It is also used as an excipient in many pharmacological preparations such as creams. Notably, ethylenediamine is a contact sensitizer capable of producing local and generalized reactions. Sensitivity to ethylenediamine may be identified with a clinical patch test.
Ethylenediamine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Ethylenediamine is a Standardized Chemical Allergen. The physiologic effect of ethylenediamine is by means of Increased Histamine Release, and Cell-mediated Immunity.
ETHYLENEDIAMINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 2 investigational indications.
