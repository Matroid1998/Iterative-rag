Name: Dihydrofolic Acid
Text:
Dihydrofolic acid is a folic acid derivative acted upon by dihydrofolate reductase to produce tetrahydrofolic acid. It interacts with bacteria during cell division and is targeted by various drugs to prevent nucleic acid synthesis. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a dihydrofolate(2-).
Dihydrofolic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Dihydrofolic acid has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, and Phaseolus vulgaris with data available.
Dihydrofolic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
