Name: Veratramine
Text:
Veratramine is a piperidine alkaloid comprising the 14,15,16,17-tetradehydro derivative of veratraman having two hydroxy groups at the 3- and 23-positions. It derives from a hydride of a veratraman.
Veratramine has been reported in Veratrum dahuricum, Veratrum grandiflorum, and other organisms with data available.
Veratramine is a hypotensive alkaloid isolated from the rhizomes of Veratrum.
