Name: Colforsin
Text:
Forskolin is a labdane diterpenoid isolated from the Indian Coleus plant. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an anti-HIV agent, a protein kinase A agonist, an adenylate cyclase agonist, an antihypertensive agent and a platelet aggregation inhibitor. It is a labdane diterpenoid, an acetate ester, an organic heterotricyclic compound, a triol, a cyclic ketone and a tertiary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
Potent activator of the adenylate cyclase system and the biosynthesis of cyclic AMP. From the plant Coleus forskohlii. Has antihypertensive, positive inotropic, platelet aggregation inhibitory, and smooth muscle relaxant activities; also lowers intraocular pressure and promotes release of hormones from the pituitary gland.
Forskolin has been reported in Plectranthus, Apis cerana, and Plectranthus barbatus with data available.
COLFORSIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
