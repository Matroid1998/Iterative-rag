Name: protoporphyrin IX
Text:
Protoporphyrin is a cyclic tetrapyrrole that consists of porphyrin bearing four methyl substituents at positions 3, 8, 13 and 17, two vinyl substituents at positions 7 and 12 and two 2-carboxyethyl substituents at positions 2 and 18. The parent of the class of protoporphyrins. It has a role as a photosensitizing agent, a metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a protoporphyrinate and a protoporphyrin(2-).
Protoporphyrin IX is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
protoporphyrin IX has been reported in Homo sapiens and Turdus merula with data available.
Protoporphyrin IX is a tetrapyrrole containing 4 methyl, 2 propionic and 2 vinyl side chains that is a metabolic precursor for hemes, cytochrome c and chlorophyll. Protoporphyrin IX is produced by oxidation of the methylene bridge of protoporphyrinogen by the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase.
Protoporphyrin IX is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
