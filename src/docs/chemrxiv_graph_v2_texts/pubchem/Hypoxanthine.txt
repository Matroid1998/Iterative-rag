Name: Hypoxanthine
Text:
Hypoxanthine is a purine nucleobase that consists of purine bearing an oxo substituent at position 6. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite. It is an oxopurine, a purine nucleobase and a nucleobase analogue. It is functionally related to an adenine.
Hypoxanthine is a purine and a reaction intermediate in the metabolism of adenosine and in the formation of nucleic acids by the salvage pathway.
Hypoxanthine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Hypoxanthine is a purine-based organic compound in human muscle tissues, Hypoxanthine is formed during purine catabolism as a product of xanthine oxidase action on xanthine, and occasionally is found as a constituent of nucleic acids. The potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of purines may be mediated by cell surface adenosine receptors. Hypoxanthine protects against oxidant-induced cell injury by inhibiting activation of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). (NCI04)
Hypoxanthine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A purine and a reaction intermediate in the metabolism of adenosine and in the formation of nucleic acids by the salvage pathway.
