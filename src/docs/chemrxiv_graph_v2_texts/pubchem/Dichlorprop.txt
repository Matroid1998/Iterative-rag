Name: Dichlorprop
Text:
Yellowish to colorless solid. Soluble in organic solvents. Used as an herbicide.
2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propanoic acid is an aromatic ether that is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid in which the hydroxy group at position 2 has been converted to its 2,4-dichlorophenyl ether. It is a monocarboxylic acid, an aromatic ether and a dichlorobenzene.
Dichlorprop is a chlorophenoxy herbicide similar in structure to 2,4-D that is used to kill annual and perennial broadleaf weeds. It is a component of many common weedkillers. About 4 million pounds of dichlorprop are used annually in the United States. (L369)
