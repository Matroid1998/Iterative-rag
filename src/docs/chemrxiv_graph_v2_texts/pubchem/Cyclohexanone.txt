Cyclohexanone appears as a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a pleasant odor. Less dense than water. Flash point 111 Â°F. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make nylon, as a chemical reaction medium, and as a solvent.
Cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone that consists of cyclohexane bearing a single oxo substituent. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite.
Cyclohexanone (also known as oxocyclohexane, pimelic ketone, ketohexamethylene, cyclohexyl ketone or ketocyclohexane) is a six-carbon cyclic molecule with a ketone functional group. It is a colorless, oily liquid with an acetone-like smell.
Cyclohexanone has been reported in Gymnodinium nagasakiense, Zingiber mioga, and other organisms with data available.
