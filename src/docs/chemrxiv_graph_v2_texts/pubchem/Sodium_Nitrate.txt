Name: Sodium Nitrate
Text:
Sodium nitrate appears as a white crystalline solid. Noncombustible but accelerates the burning of combustible materials. If large quantities are involved in fire or the combustible material is finely divided an explosion may result. May explode under prolonged exposure to heat or fire. Toxic oxides of nitrogen are produced in fires. Used in solid propellants, explosives, fertilizers, and for many other uses.
Sodium nitrate is the inorganic nitrate salt of sodium. It has a role as a fertilizer and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an inorganic sodium salt and an inorganic nitrate salt.
SODIUM NITRATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 6 investigational indications.
Sodium nitrate is a nitrate of sodium. It is used as an ingredient in fertilizers, pyrotechnics, as a food preservative, and as a solid rocket propellant, and also in glass and pottery enamels. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia. (L1137,  L1636)
