Name: Vinylidene fluoride
Text:
1,1-Difluoroethylene (or vinylidene fluoride) is a colorless gas which is flammable in the ranges of 5.5 to 21%. It is toxic by inhalation and contact. It is slightly soluble in water and soluble in alcohol and ether. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket.
Vinylidene fluoride is an organofluorine compound and an olefinic compound.
