Name: Cyclohexanol
Text:
Cyclohexanol appears as a colorless liquid with a camphor-like odor. Soluble in most organic liquids. Flash point 154 Â°F. May be toxic by inhalation or skin exposure. Vapors are narcotic in high concentrations. Irritates skin, eyes and mucus membranes. Used in making soap, lacquers, and plastics.
Cyclohexanol is an alcohol that consists of cyclohexane bearing a single hydroxy substituent. The parent of the class of cyclohexanols. It has a role as a solvent. It is a secondary alcohol and a member of cyclohexanols.
Cyclohexanol has been reported in Punica granatum, Gossypium hirsutum, and Mangifera indica with data available.
Monohydroxy derivatives of cyclohexanes that contain the general formula R-C6H11O. They have a camphorlike odor and are used in making soaps, insecticides, germicides, dry cleaning, and plasticizers. 
cyclohexanol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
