Name: Pyrimidine
Text:
Pyrimidine is the parent compound of the pyrimidines; a diazine having the two nitrogens at the 1- and 3-positions. It has a role as a Daphnia magna metabolite. It is a member of pyrimidines and a diazine.
Pyrimidine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Pyrimidine has been reported in Homo sapiens, Panax ginseng, and other organisms with data available.
Pyrimidine is one of two classes of heterocyclic nitrogenous bases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA: in DNA the pyrimidines are cytosine and thymine, in RNA uracil replaces thymine.
Pyrimidine Dimer is a pair of pyrimidine bases (thymine or cytosine in DNA or uracil in double-stranded RNA) within a nucleic acid covalently linked by a cyclobutane ring, the formation of which was induced by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The presence of pyrimidine dimers inhibits DNA replication; improper repair of these lesions promotes DNA mutagenesis.
PYRIMIDINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 4 investigational indications.
