Name: Propidium Iodide
Text:
Propidium iodide is an organic iodide salt. It contains a propidium.
Propidium Iodide is a fluorescent nucleic acid dye which binds only to double-stranded nucleic acids. It has a molecular weight of 668.4, an absorbance maximum of 535nm, and an emission maximum of 617 nm.  It is commonly used to determine the DNA content of a cell or to discriminate viable from non-viable cells.
Quaternary ammonium analog of ethidium; an intercalating dye with a specific affinity to certain forms of DNA and, used as diiodide, to separate them in density gradients; also forms fluorescent complexes with cholinesterase which it inhibits.
