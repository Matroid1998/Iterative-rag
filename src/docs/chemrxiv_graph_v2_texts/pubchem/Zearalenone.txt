Name: Zearalenone
Text:
Zearalenone appears as white microcrystals or white powder. (NTP, 1992)
Zearalenone is a macrolide comprising a fourteen-membered lactone fused to 1,3-dihydroxybenzene; a potent estrogenic metabolite produced by some Giberella species. It has a role as a fungal metabolite and a mycoestrogen. It is a macrolide and a member of resorcinols.
Zearalenone has been reported in Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium equiseti, and other organisms with data available.
(S-(E))-3,4,5,6,8,10-Hexahydro-14,16-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1H-2-benzoxacyclotetradecin-1,7(8H)-dione. One of a group of compounds known under the general designation of resorcylic acid lactones. Cis, trans, dextro and levo forms have been isolated from the fungus Gibberella zeae (formerly Fusarium graminearum). They have estrogenic activity, cause toxicity in livestock as feed contaminant, and have been used as anabolic or estrogen substitutes.
