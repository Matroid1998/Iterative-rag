Name: Epigallocatechin Gallate
Text:
(-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a gallate ester obtained by the formal condensation of gallic acid with the (3R)-hydroxy group of (-)-epigallocatechin. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, an antioxidant, a Hsp90 inhibitor, a neuroprotective agent, a plant metabolite, a geroprotector and an apoptosis inducer. It is a gallate ester, a polyphenol and a member of flavans. It is functionally related to a (-)-epigallocatechin.
Epigallocatechin gallate has been investigated for the treatment of Hypertension and Diabetic Nephropathy.
(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Eschweilera coriacea, and other organisms with data available.
Epigallocatechin Gallate is a phenolic antioxidant found in a number of plants such as green and black tea. It inhibits cellular oxidation and prevents free radical damage to cells. It is under study as a potential cancer chemopreventive agent. (NCI)
EPIGALOCATECHIN GALLATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 39 investigational indications.
