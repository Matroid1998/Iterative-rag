Name: Dimethyl carbonate
Text:
Dimethyl carbonate appears as a clear, colorless liquid with a pleasant odor. Denser than water and slightly soluble in water. Vapors are heavier than air. Used to make other chemicals and as a special purpose solvent.
Dimethyl carbonate is a carbonate ester that is carbonic acid in which both hydrogens are replaced by methyl groups. A flammable, colourless liquid (m.p. 2-4℃, b.p. 90℃) with a characterstic ester-like odour, it is used as a 'green' methylating agent and as a solvent. It has a role as a solvent and a reagent.
