Name: 2-Naphthol
Text:
2-naphthol is a naphthol carrying a hydroxy group at position 2. It has a role as an antinematodal drug, a genotoxin, a human xenobiotic metabolite, a mouse metabolite, a human urinary metabolite and a radical scavenger.
2-Naphthol is a colorless crystalline solid and an isomer of 1-naphthol, differing by the location of the hydroxyl group on naphthalene. The naphthols are naphthalene homologues of phenol, with the hydroxyl group being more reactive than in the phenols. 2-Naphthol has several different uses including dyes, pigments, fats, oils, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, antiseptics, synthesis of fungicides, and antioxidants for rubber. Detection of 2-Naphthol in urine usually results from long-term persistent exposure to pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, but also due to exposure to naphthalene in older types of mothballs, fires that produce polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and tobacco smoke.
