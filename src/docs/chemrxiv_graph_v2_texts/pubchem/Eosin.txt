Name: Eosin
Text:
Eosin is a red crystalline powder. (NTP, 1992)
Eosin YS dye is an organic sodium salt that is 2',4',5',7'-tetrabromofluorescein in which the carboxy group and the phenolic hydroxy group have been deprotonated and the resulting charge is neutralised by two sodium ions. It has a role as a fluorochrome and a histological dye. It is an organobromine compound and an organic sodium salt. It contains a 2',4',5',7'-tetrabromofluorescein(2-).
A versatile red dye used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, etc., and as tissue stain, vital stain, and counterstain with HEMATOXYLIN. It is also used in special culture media.
