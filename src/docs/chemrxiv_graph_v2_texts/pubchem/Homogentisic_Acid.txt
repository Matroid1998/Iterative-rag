Name: Homogentisic Acid
Text:
Homogentisic acid is a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid having the two hydroxy substituents at the 2- and 5-positions. It has a role as a human metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and a member of hydroquinones. It is functionally related to a phenylacetic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a homogentisate.
Homogentisic acid has been reported in Penicillium commune, Penicillium simplicissimum, and other organisms with data available.
Homogentisic acid is an intermediate of the metabolic breakdown of tyrosine and phenylalanine; it occurs in the urine in cases of alkaptonuria. (OMIN 203500) Homogentisic acid is the primary precursor of melanin synthesis in Vibrio cholerae.
Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid with hydroxyls at the 2 and 5 positions of the phenyl ring.
