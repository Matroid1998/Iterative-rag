Name: Sodium Azide
Text:
Sodium azide appears as a colorless crystalline solid. Density 1.85 g / cm3. Burns in air and may explode if large quantities are involved. Toxic by ingestion. Toxic oxides of nitrogen are produced in fires.
Sodium azide is the sodium salt of hydrogen azide (hydrazoic acid). It has a role as a mutagen, an antibacterial agent, an explosive and a mitochondrial respiratory-chain inhibitor. It contains an azide anion.
A cytochrome oxidase inhibitor which is a nitridizing agent and an inhibitor of terminal oxidation. (From Merck Index, 12th ed)
