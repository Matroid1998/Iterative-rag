Name: Calcium Phosphate
Text:
Calcium phosphate is an odorless white solid. Sinks and mixes with water. (USCG, 1999)
Tricalcium bis(phosphate) is a calcium phosphate.
Calcium phosphate is typically available as an over the counter supplement, antacid, or as an added ingredient in some toothpastes.
Calcium Phosphate is the calcium salt of phosphoric acid with widely used applications. This agent can be used as a countermeasure for exposure to strontium and radium radionuclides. Upon oral uptake, calcium phosphate competes for and blocks the absorption of radium (Ra-226) and strontium (Sr-90) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
CALCIUM PHOSPHATE, TRIBASIC is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II and has 1 investigational indication.
