Name: Bis(pinacolato)diboron
Text:
Bis(pinacolato)diboron is a 1,3,2-dioxaborolane that is 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane in which the boron hydrogen at position 2 is replaced by a 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl group. It is a reagent used in organic synthesis to synthesise pinacol boronic esters. It has a role as an EC 3.4.24.24 (gelatinase A) inhibitor.
