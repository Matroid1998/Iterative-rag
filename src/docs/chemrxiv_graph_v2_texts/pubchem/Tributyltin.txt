Name: Tributyltin
Text:
Tributyltin is an organotin compound. Tributyltins are the main active ingredients in certain biocides used to control a broad spectrum of organisms, and are also used in wood preservation, marine paints (as antifouling pesticides), and textiles and industrial water systems (as antifungal agents). They also considered moderately to highly persistent organic pollutants and are especially hazardous to marine ecosystems. The main toxic component of tributyltins is tin. Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn and atomic number 50. It is a natural component of the earth's crust and is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, where it occurs as tin dioxide.
