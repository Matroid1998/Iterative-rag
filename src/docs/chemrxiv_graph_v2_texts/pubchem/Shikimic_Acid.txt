Name: Shikimic Acid
Text:
Shikimic acid is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid that is cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 3, 4 and 5 (the 3R,4S,5R stereoisomer). It is an intermediate metabolite in plants and microorganisms. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid, a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid and an alpha,beta-unsaturated monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a shikimate.
Shikimic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Shikimic acid has been reported in Streptomyces nigra, Castanopsis fissa, and other organisms with data available.
Shikimic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A tri-hydroxy cyclohexene carboxylic acid metabolite of the shikimate pathway. It is important in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, flavonoids and alkaloids in plants and microorganisms.
