Name: Sinefungin
Text:
Sinefungin is an adenosine that is the the delta-(5'-adenosyl) derivative of ornithine. It has a role as an antifungal agent and an antimicrobial agent. It is a member of adenosines and a non-proteinogenic alpha-amino acid. It is functionally related to a L-ornithine.
Sinefungin is a solid. This compound belongs to the purine nucleosides and analogues. These are compounds comprising a purine base attached to a sugar. The proteins that adenosyl-ornithine target include RdmB, modification methylase TaqI, rRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase, and modification methylase RsrI.
Sinefungin has been reported in Streptomyces griseolus and Streptomyces halstedii with data available.
Sinefungin is a natural nucleoside related to S-adenosylmethionine that has been isolated from Streptomyces species with antifungal, antiviral and antiparasitic activity. Sinefungin inhibits DNA methyltransferase which leads to an inhibition of DNA synthesis.
SINEFUNGIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
