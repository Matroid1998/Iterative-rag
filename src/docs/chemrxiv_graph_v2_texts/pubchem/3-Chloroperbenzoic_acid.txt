Name: 3-Chloroperbenzoic acid
Text:
This solid peroxide is sensitive to heat. Storage of this material must be done so with stringent temperature control measures. Its explosion hazard is also mitigated by mixing the peroxide in a solvent slurry.
3-chloroperbenzoic acid is a peroxy acid and a member of monochlorobenzenes.
