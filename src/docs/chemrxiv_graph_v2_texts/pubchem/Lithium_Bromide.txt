Name: Lithium Bromide
Text:
Lithium bromide is a lithium salt in which the counterion is bromide. The anhydrous salt forms cubic crystals similar to common salt. It is a bromide salt and a lithium salt.
Lithium bromide, is a chemical compound of lithium and bromine. Its extreme hygroscopic character make it useful as a desiccant in certain air conditioning systems. It is also a useful reagent in organic synthesis. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock. (L625, L656)
