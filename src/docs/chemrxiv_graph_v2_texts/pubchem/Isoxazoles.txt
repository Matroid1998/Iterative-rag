Name: Isoxazoles
Text:
Isoxazole is a monocyclic heteroarene with a structure consisting of a 5-membered ring containing three carbon atoms and an oxygen and nitrogen atom adjacent to each other. It is the parent of the class of isoxazoles. It is a mancude organic heteromonocyclic parent, a monocyclic heteroarene and a member of isoxazoles.
Isoxazole has been reported in Nicotiana tabacum with data available.
Azoles with an OXYGEN and a NITROGEN next to each other at the 1,2 positions, in contrast to OXAZOLES that have nitrogens at the 1,3 positions.
