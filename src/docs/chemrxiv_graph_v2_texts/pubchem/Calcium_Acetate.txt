Name: Calcium Acetate
Text:
Calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It is used, commonly as a hydrate, to treat hyperphosphataemia (excess phosphate in the blood) in patients with kidney disease: the calcium ion combines with dietary phosphate to form (insoluble) calcium phosphate, which is excreted in the faeces. It has a role as a chelator. It contains an acetate.
The chemical compound calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid. It has been commonly referred to as the acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic, therefore the monohydrate is the common form.
Calcium Acetate is a calcium salt of acetic acid. Calcium is a mineral essential for many cellular functions including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, cardiac function, bone formation, and capillary and cell membrane permeability. Calcium acetate is administered orally to prevent or treat calcium deficiency and to treat hyperphosphatemia due to its phosphate-binding properties.
CALCIUM ACETATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1982 and has 3 approved indications.
