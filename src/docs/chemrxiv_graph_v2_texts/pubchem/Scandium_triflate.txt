Name: Scandium triflate
Text:
Slotoxin is a peptide from Centruroides noxius Hoffmann scorpion venom. It belongs to the short scorpion toxin superfamily. Slotoxin reversibly blocks the high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels composed of only ‘±-subunits (Kd = 1.5 nM). Unreversibly blocks the high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels composed of ‘±- and beta1-subunits. Unreversibly and weakly blocks the high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels composed of ‘±- and beta4-subunits. It shows no activity on other potassium channels.
