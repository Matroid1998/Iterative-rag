Name: Pimonidazole
Text:
Pimonidazole is a C-nitro compound.
Pimonidazole is under investigation for the diagnostic of Prostate Cancer and Head and Neck Cancer.
Pimonidazole is a 2-nitroimidazole with hypoxic selectivity and potential radiosensitizing activities. Pimonidazole is reduced in hypoxic environments such as those found in tumors. In hypoxic cells, reduced pimonidazole binds to thiol-containing proteins. The resulting complexes accumulate in hypoxic tumors, thereby depleting radioprotective thiol compounds and sensitizing tumor cells to be more susceptible for radiation treatment.
PIMONIDAZOLE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.
