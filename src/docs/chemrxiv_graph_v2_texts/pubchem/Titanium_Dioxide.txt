Titanium dioxide (airborne, unbound particles of respirable size) can cause cancer according to California Labor Code.
Titanium dioxide is an odorless white powder. Tasteless. pH 7.5. Occurs in three crystalline forms. (NTP, 1992)
Titanium dioxide is a titanium oxide with the formula TiO2. A naturally occurring oxide sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase, it has a wide range of applications. It has a role as a food colouring.
Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium. It is used as a pigment under the names titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or CI 77891. It is typically extracted from ilmenite, rutile and anatase.
Anatase is a mineral with formula of Ti4+O2 or TiO2. The corresponding IMA (International Mineralogical Association) number is IMA1962 s.p.. The IMA symbol is Ant.
Brookite is a mineral with formula of Ti4+O2 or TiO2. The IMA symbol is Brk.
Rutile is a mineral with formula of Ti4+O2 or TiO2. The IMA symbol is Rt.
