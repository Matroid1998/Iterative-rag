Name: Propane
Text:
Propane appears as a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor. It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its vapor pressure. For transportation it may be stenched. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite by evaporative cooling. Easily ignited. The vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily. The leak may be either a liquid or vapor leak. The vapors can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Under prolonged exposure to fire or heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket.
Propane is an alkane and a gas molecular entity. It has a role as a food propellant.
Propane has been reported in Calendula officinalis with data available.
A three carbon alkane with the formula H3CCH2CH3.
