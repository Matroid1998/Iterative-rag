Name: Nitromethane
Text:
Nitromethane can cause cancer according to The National Toxicology Program.
Nitromethane appears as a colorless oily liquid. Flash point 95 °F. May violently decompose if intensely heated when contaminated. Denser than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence sinks in water. Vapors are heavier than air. Moderately toxic. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.
Nitromethane is a primary nitroalkane that is methane in which one of the hydrogens is replace by a nitro group. A polar solvent (b.p. 101 ℃), it is an important starting material in organic synthesis. It is also used as a fuel for rockets and radio-controlled models. It has a role as an EC 4.3.1.3 (histidine ammonia-lyase) inhibitor, a polar aprotic solvent, an explosive and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is a primary nitroalkane and a volatile organic compound.
Nitromethane is a colorless, oily, highly flammable liquid with a strong, disagreeable odor that emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides upon decomposition. Nitromethane is used to make industrial antimicrobials and pharmaceuticals, and is also used as a soil fumigant and as a fuel in race car engines. Exposure to nitromethane irritates the skin and affects the central nervous system causing nausea, dizziness and narcosis. This substance is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)
