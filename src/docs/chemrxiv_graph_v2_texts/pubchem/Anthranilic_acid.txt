Name: Anthranilic acid
Text:
Anthranilic acid appears as odorless white to pale-yellow or tan crystalline powder with a sweetish taste. (NTP, 1992)
Anthranilic acid is an aminobenzoic acid that is benzoic acid having a single amino substituent located at position 2. It is a metabolite produced in L-tryptophan-kynurenine pathway in the central nervous system. It has a role as a mouse metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of an anthranilate.
2-Aminobenzoic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Anthranilic acid has been reported in Glycine max, Streptomyces, and other organisms with data available.
2-Aminobenzoic acid is a uremic toxin.  Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.  
2-Aminobenzoic acid is an organic compound. It is a substrate of enzyme anthranilate hydroxylase [EC 1.14.13.35] in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation pathway (KEGG).
2-Aminobenzoic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
