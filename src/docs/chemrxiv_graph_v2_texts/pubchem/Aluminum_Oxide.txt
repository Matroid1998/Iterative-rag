Name: Aluminum Oxide
Text:
Aluminum oxide is a white odorless crystalline powder. Water insoluble. Properties (both physical and chemical) vary according to the method of preparation; different methods give different crystalline modifications. The variety formed at very high temperature is quite inert chemically.  alpha-Alumina is the main component of technical grade alumina. Corundum is natural aluminum oxide. Emery is an impure crystalline variety of aluminum oxide. (NIOSH, 2024)
Aluminum oxide has a chemical formula Al2O3. It is amphoteric in nature, and is used in various chemical, industrial and commercial applications. It is considered an indirect additive used in food contact substances by the FDA.
An oxide of aluminum, occurring in nature as various minerals such as bauxite, corundum, etc. It is used as an adsorbent, desiccating agent, and catalyst, and in the manufacture of dental cements and refractories.
