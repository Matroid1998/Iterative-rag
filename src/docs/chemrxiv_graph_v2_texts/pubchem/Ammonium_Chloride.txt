Name: Ammonium Chloride
Text:
Ammonium chloride is a white crystalline solid. It is soluble in water(37%). The primary hazard is the threat posed to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the environment. It is used to make other ammonium compounds, as a soldering flux, as a fertilizer, and for many other uses.
Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chloride having ammonium as the counterion. It has a role as a ferroptosis inhibitor. It is an inorganic chloride and an ammonium salt.
Ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula NH4Cl. It is highly soluble in water producing mildly acidic solutions.
Ammonium Chloride is a systemic and urinary acidifying salt. Ammonium chloride helps maintain pH and exerts a mild diuretic effect. This acid forming salt also exerts an expectorant effect by irritating the mucous membranes and is used for alleviation of cough.
An acidifying agent that has expectorant and diuretic effects. Also used in etching and batteries and as a flux in electroplating.
