Name: Cannabigerolic acid
Text:
Cannabigerolic acid is a dihydroxybenzoic acid that is olivetolic acid in which the hydrogen at position 3 is substituted by a geranyl group. A biosynthetic precursor to Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant. It is a dihydroxybenzoic acid, a diterpenoid, a polyketide, a member of resorcinols and a phytocannabinoid. It is functionally related to an olivetolic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a cannabigerolate.
Cannabigerolic acid has been reported in Helichrysum umbraculigerum and Cannabis sativa with data available.
