Name: Hydroorotic acid, DL-
Text:
Dihydroorotic acid is a pyrimidinemonocarboxylic acid that results from the base-catalysed cyclisation of N(alpha)-carbethoxyasparagine. It is a secondary amide, a monocarboxylic acid, a pyrimidinemonocarboxylic acid and a N-acylurea. It is functionally related to an orotic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a dihydroorotate.
4,5-Dihydroorotic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Dihydroorotic acid has been reported in Homo sapiens with data available.
