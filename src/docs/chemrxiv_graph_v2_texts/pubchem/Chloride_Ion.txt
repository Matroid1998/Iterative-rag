Name: Chloride Ion
Text:
Chloride is a halide anion formed when chlorine picks up an electron to form an an anion. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a cofactor. It is a halide anion and a monoatomic chlorine. It is a conjugate base of a hydrogen chloride.
Chloride is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Chloride Ion is a chlorine anion that forms the negatively charged part of certain salts, including sodium and hydrogen chloride salts, and is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells.
Chloride is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Inorganic compounds derived from hydrochloric acid that contain the Cl- ion.
