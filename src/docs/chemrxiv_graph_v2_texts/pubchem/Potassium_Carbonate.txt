Name: Potassium Carbonate
Text:
Potassium carbonate is a potassium salt that is the dipotassium salt of carbonic acid. It has a role as a catalyst, a fertilizer and a flame retardant. It is a carbonate salt and a potassium salt.
Potassium carbonate (K2CO3) is a white salt, soluble in water (insoluble in ethanol) which forms a strongly alkaline solution. It can be made as the product of potassium hydroxide's absorbent reaction with carbon dioxide. It presents a large capacity to absorb moisture.
