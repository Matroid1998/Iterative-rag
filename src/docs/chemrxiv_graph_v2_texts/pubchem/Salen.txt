Name: Salen
Text:
Salcomine appears as a solid complex between the cobalt(II) ion and the condensation product of salicylaldehyde and ethylenediamine. Such condensation products are called "Schiff's bases." Complexation with cobalt nullifies their basic properties. Used as a catalyst for various oxidation reactions in which it behaves as an oxygen carrier.
