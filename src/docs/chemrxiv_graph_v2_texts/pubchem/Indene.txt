Name: Indene
Text:
Indene appears as a colorless liquid derived from coal tar. Fp: -2 °C; bp:182 °C. Density 0.997 g cm-3. Insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.
1H-indene is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene comprising of benzene and cyclopentene rings. It is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene and an indene.
Indene has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Vaccinium macrocarpon, and other organisms with data available.
Indene is a flammable polycyclic hydrocarbon. It is composed of a benzene ring fused with a cyclopentene ring. This aromatic liquid is colorless although samples often are pale yellow. The principal industrial use of indene is in the production of indene/coumarone thermoplastic resins.
