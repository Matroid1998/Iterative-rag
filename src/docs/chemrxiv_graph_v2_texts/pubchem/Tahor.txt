Atorvastatin calcium is an organic calcium salt composed of calcium cations and atorvastatin anions in a 1:2 ratio. It contains an atorvastatin(1-).
Atorvastatin Calcium is the calcium salt of atorvastatin, a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin competitively inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. This agent increases the number of LDL receptors on hepatic cell surfaces, enhancing the uptake and catabolism of LDL and reducing LDL production and the number of LDL particles, and lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels. Like other statins, atorvastatin may also display direct antineoplastic activity, possibly by inhibiting farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of proteins such as small GTP-binding proteins, which may result in the arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This agent may also sensitize tumor cells to cyctostatic drugs, possibly through the mTOR-dependent inhibition of Akt phosphorylation.
Atorvastatin Calcium Anhydrous is an anhydrous calcium salt form of atorvastin, a synthetic lipid-lowering agent.
ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1996 and has 13 approved and 99 investigational indications.
A pyrrole and heptanoic acid derivative, HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTARYL-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR (statin), and ANTICHOLESTEREMIC AGENT that is used to reduce serum levels of LDL-CHOLESTEROL; APOLIPOPROTEIN B; and TRIGLYCERIDES. It is used to increase serum levels of HDL-CHOLESTEROL in the treatment of HYPERLIPIDEMIAS, and for the prevention of CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES in patients with multiple risk factors.
