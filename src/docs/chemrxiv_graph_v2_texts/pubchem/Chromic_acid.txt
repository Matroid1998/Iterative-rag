Name: Chromic acid
Text:
Chromic acid is a chromium oxoacid. It has a role as an oxidising agent. It is a conjugate acid of a hydrogenchromate.
Chromic acid generally refers to a collection of compounds generated by the acidification of solutions containing chromate and dichromate anions or the dissolving of chromium trioxide in sulfuric acid. Chromic acid contains hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium refers to chromium in the +6 oxidation state, and is more toxic than other oxidation states of the chromium atom because of its greater ability to enter cells and a higher redox potential. (9) Molecular chromic acid, H2CrO4, has much in common with sulfuric acid, H2SO4 as both are classified as strong acids. Chromic acid was widely used in the instrument repair industry, due to its ability to "brighten" raw brass. A chromic acid dip leaves behind a bright yellow patina on the brass. Due to growing health and environmental concerns, many have discontinued use of this chemical in their repair shops.  Most chromic acid sold or available as a 10% aqueous solution.
