Name: Methandrostenolone
Text:
Methandrostenolone is an organic molecular entity.
Metandienone is an orally active anabolic androgenic steroid. It was introduced to the market in the 1960s but later discontinued and withdrawn from the market. Although it is prohibited in and outside competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency, metandienone continues to be marketed and misused as a performance-enhancing drug in sports. In the US, metandienone is a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.
METHANDROSTENOLONE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV. It was withdrawn in at least one region.
A synthetic steroid with anabolic properties that are more pronounced than its androgenic effects. It has little progestational activity. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1188)
