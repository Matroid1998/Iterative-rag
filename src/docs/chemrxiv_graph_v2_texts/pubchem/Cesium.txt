Name: Cesium
Text:
Cesium is a naturally occurring element found combined with other elements in rocks, soil, and dust in low amounts. Naturally occurring cesium is not radioactive and is referred to as stable cesium. There is only one stable form of cesium naturally present in the environment,133Cs (read as cesium one-thirty-three). Nuclear explosions or the breakdown of uranium in fuel elements can produce two radioactive forms of cesium,134Cs and137Cs. Both isotopes decay into non-radioactive elements.134Cs and137Cs generate beta particles as they decay. It takes about 2 years for half of134Cs to give off its radiation and about 30 years for137Cs; this is called the halflife.
Cesium appears as a soft metallic solid. Melts at 85 Â°F. Causes burns to skin and eyes.
Caesium atom is an alkali metal atom.
Cesium is under investigation in clinical trial NCT02794675 (Intraoperative Placement of Cesium-131 Permanent Interstitial Brachytherapy in Head and Neck Cancer).
cesium is a mineral.
Cesium (Caesium) is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28&#176;C (82&#176;F). Cesium is used in various industries, from the oil industry as cesium formate in drilling fluid, atomic clocks, centrifugation fluids, and cesium vapor thermionic generators, which convert heat energy to electrical energy.
A member of the alkali metals. It has an atomic symbol Cs, atomic number 55, and atomic weight 132.91. Cesium has many industrial applications, including the construction of atomic clocks based on its atomic vibrational frequency.
