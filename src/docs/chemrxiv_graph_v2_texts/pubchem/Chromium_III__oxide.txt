Name: Chromium(III) oxide
Text:
Dichromium trioxide is a chromium oxide.
Chromium(III) oxide is an oxide of chromium that occurs in nature as the rare mineral eskolaite. It is commonly used as pigment, under the name viridian, in paints, inks, and glasses. Chromium is a chemical element which has the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is found naturally occuring in rocks, animals, plants, and soil, and is usually mined as chromite ore. Chromium is most toxic in its +6 oxidation state (chromium(VI)) due to its greater ability to enter cells and higher redox potential. Trivalent chromium (chromium(III)) however, is biologically necessary for sugar and lipid metabolism in humans. (L17, L523)
