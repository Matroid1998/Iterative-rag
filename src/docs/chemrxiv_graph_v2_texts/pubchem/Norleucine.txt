Name: Norleucine
Text:
L-norleucine is a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid comprising hexanoic acid carrying an amino group at C-2. It does not occur naturally. It is a 2-aminohexanoic acid and a non-proteinogenic L-alpha-amino acid. It is a conjugate acid of a L-2-aminohexanoate. It is an enantiomer of a D-norleucine. It is a tautomer of a L-2-aminohexanoic acid zwitterion.
Norleucine is under investigation in clinical trial NCT00081952 (Amino Acid Therapy for Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women).
L-Norleucine has been reported in Daphnia pulex, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.
NORLEUCINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of I (across all indications) and has 2 investigational indications.
An unnatural amino acid that is used experimentally to study protein structure and function. It is structurally similar to METHIONINE, however it does not contain SULFUR.
