Name: Pyridinium dichromate
Text:
Pyridinium dichromate is a chemical compound of pyridinium and hexavalent chromium. It is used as an oxidizing agent. Hexavalent chromium refers to chemical compounds that contain the element chromium in the +6 oxidation state. Chromium(VI) is more toxic than other oxidation states of the chromium atom because of its greater ability to enter cells and higher redox potential. (L16, L57)
