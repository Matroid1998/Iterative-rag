Name: Bromochlorodifluoromethane
Text:
CHLORODIFLUOROBROMOMETHANE is a colorless, nonflammable gas. It is mildly toxic by inhalation. It can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Exposure of the container to prolonged heat or fire may cause it to rupture violently and rocket. It is used as a refrigerant gas.
Bromochlorodifluoromethane is a one-carbon compound that is methane in which the hydrogens have been replaced by two fluorines, a bromine, and a chlorine. Widely used in 'vapourising liquid'-type fire extinguishers, its use is now generally banned under the Montreal Protocol (ozone-depleting substances), although it is still used in certain applications (e.g. aviation). It is a one-carbon compound, an organobromine compound, an organochlorine compound and an organofluorine compound.
