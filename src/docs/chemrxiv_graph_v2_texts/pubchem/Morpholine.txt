Name: Morpholine
Text:
Morpholine appears as a colorless liquid with a fishlike odor. Flash point 100 Â°F. Corrosive to tissue. Less dense than water and soluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make other chemicals, as a corrosion inhibitor, and in detergents.
Morpholine is an organic heteromonocyclic compound whose six-membered ring contains four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom and one oxygen atom that lies opposite to each other; the parent compound of the morpholine family. It has a role as a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is a saturated organic heteromonocyclic parent and a member of morpholines. It is a conjugate base of a morpholinium.
