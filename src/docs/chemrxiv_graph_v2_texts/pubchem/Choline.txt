Name: Choline
Text:
Choline is a choline that is the parent compound of the cholines class, consisting of ethanolamine having three methyl substituents attached to the amino function. It has a role as a neurotransmitter, a nutrient, a human metabolite, a plant metabolite, a Daphnia magna metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and an allergen.
A basic constituent of lecithin that is found in many plants and animal organs. It is important as a precursor of acetylcholine, as a methyl donor in various metabolic processes, and in lipid metabolism.
Choline is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Choline has been reported in Amaranthus hybridus, Leonurus japonicus, and other organisms with data available.
CHOLINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of I (Early) and has 1 investigational indication.
Choline is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A basic constituent of lecithin that is found in many plants and animal organs. It is important as a precursor of acetylcholine, as a methyl donor in various metabolic processes, and in lipid metabolism.
