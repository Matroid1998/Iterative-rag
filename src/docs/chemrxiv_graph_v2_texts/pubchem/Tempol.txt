Name: Tempol
Text:
4-hydroxy-TEMPO is a member of the class of aminoxyls that is TEMPO carrying a hydroxy substituent at position 4. It is a radical scavenger which exhibits anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It has a role as a radical scavenger, a catalyst, a nephroprotective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a neuroprotective agent, a hepatoprotective agent, an antineoplastic agent and an apoptosis inducer. It is a member of aminoxyls and a hydroxypiperidine. It is functionally related to a TEMPO.
Tempol has been used in trials studying the treatment of Anal Cancer.
Topical Piperidine Nitroxide MTS-01 is a topical gel containing a cell permeable hydrophilic piperidine nitroxide with potential radioprotective and antioxidant activity. As a stable, free radical compound, MTS-01 may be able to protect cells against the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS), upon exposure to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. The topically applied MTS-01 may protect normal tissue from radiation-induced toxicity, such as radiation dermatitis, during radiation therapy.
TEMPOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 6 investigational indications.
