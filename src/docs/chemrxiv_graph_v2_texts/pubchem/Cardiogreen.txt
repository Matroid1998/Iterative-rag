Name: Cardiogreen
Text:
Indocyanine Green is a nontoxic, fluorescent, tricarbocyanine dye with a peak spectral absorption at 790 nm, with application in determining cardiac output, hepatic function, liver blood flow, as well as ophthalmic angiography. Upon administration, indocyanine green (ICG) rapidly binds to its principle carrier, plasma protein, and is thereby confined to the vascular space. This agent, with a half-life of 150 to 180 seconds, is removed exclusively by the liver from circulation to bile juice. Furthermore, due to poor uptake, ICG is not suitable for angiography or functional output analysis of kidney, lung, cerebro-spinal, or peripheral tissues.
A tricarbocyanine dye that is used diagnostically in liver function tests and to determine blood volume and cardiac output.
