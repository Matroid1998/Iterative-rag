Name: N-Acetyl-Neuraminic Acid
Text:
N-acetylneuraminic acid is an N-acylneuraminic acid where the N-acyl group is specified as acetyl. It has a role as an antioxidant, an EC 3.2.1.18 (exo-alpha-sialidase) inhibitor, a bacterial metabolite, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a N-acetylneuraminate.
N-Acetylneuraminic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
N-acetylneuraminate is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
N-Acetyl-Neuraminic Acid has been reported in Homo sapiens, Brassica napus, and Trypanosoma brucei with data available.
An N-acyl derivative of neuraminic acid. N-acetylneuraminic acid occurs in many polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids in animals and bacteria. (From Dorland, 28th ed, p1518)
