Name: Quinazoline
Text:
Quinazoline is a mancude organic heterobicyclic parent that is naphthalene in which the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 3 have been replaced by nitrogen atoms. It is a mancude organic heterobicyclic parent, a member of quinazolines, an azaarene and an ortho-fused heteroarene.
Quinazoline has been reported in Nicotiana tabacum with data available.
A group of aromatic heterocyclic compounds that contain a bicyclic structure with two fused six-membered aromatic rings, a benzene ring and a pyrimidine ring.
