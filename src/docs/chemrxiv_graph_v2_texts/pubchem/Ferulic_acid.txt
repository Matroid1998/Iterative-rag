Text:
Ferulic acid is a ferulic acid consisting of trans-cinnamic acid bearing methoxy and hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 4 respectively on the phenyl ring. It has a role as an antioxidant, a MALDI matrix material, a plant metabolite, an anti-inflammatory agent, an apoptosis inhibitor and a cardioprotective agent. It is a conjugate acid of a ferulate.
Ferulic acid has been reported in Salvia rosmarinus, Camellia reticulata, and other organisms with data available.
Ferulic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
