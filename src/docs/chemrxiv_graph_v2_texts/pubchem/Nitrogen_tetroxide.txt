Name: Nitrogen tetroxide
Text:
Nitrogen tetroxide appears as red-brown liquid with a sharp, unpleasant chemical odor. Low-boiling (boiling point 21.15 Â°C) and held as a liquid by compression. Density 1.448 g / cm3. Consists of an equilibrium mixture of brown NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and colorless N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide). Evolves poisonous brown vapors. Cylinders and ton containers may not be equipped with a safety relief device. Prolonged exposure of the containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.
Dinitrogen tetraoxide is a nitrogen oxide. It has a role as an oxidising agent.
Dinitrogen tetroxide is a chemical compound that is a powerful oxidizer, highly toxic, and corrosive. It is used mainly as a rocket propellant. Nitrite is a toxic compound known to cause methemoglobinemia. (L1137,  L1625)
