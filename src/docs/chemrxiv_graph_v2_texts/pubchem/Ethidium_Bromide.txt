Name: Ethidium Bromide
Text:
Ethidium bromide is the organic bromide salt of ethidium. It has a role as a trypanocidal drug, a geroprotector and an intercalator. It contains an ethidium.
A trypanocidal agent and possible antiviral agent that is widely used in experimental cell biology and biochemistry. Ethidium has several experimentally useful properties including binding to nucleic acids, noncompetitive inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and fluorescence among others. It is most commonly used as the bromide.
