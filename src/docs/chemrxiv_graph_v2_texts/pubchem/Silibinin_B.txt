Name: Silibinin B
Text:
Silybin B is a flavonolignan.
Silibinin B has been reported in Aspergillus iizukae, Anastatica hierochuntica, and other organisms with data available.
Silymarin is a mixture of flavonolignans isolated from the milk thistle plant Silybum marianum.  Silymarin may act as an antioxidant, protecting hepatic cells from chemotherapy-related free radical damage. This agent may also promote the growth of new hepatic cells. (NCI04)
The major active component of silymarin flavonoids extracted from seeds of the MILK THISTLE, Silybum marianum; it is used in the treatment of HEPATITIS; LIVER CIRRHOSIS; and CHEMICAL AND DRUG INDUCED LIVER INJURY, and has antineoplastic activity; silybins A and B are diastereomers.
