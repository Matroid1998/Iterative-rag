Name: Telithromycin
Text:
Telithromycin is an amino sugar.
Telithromycin, a semi-synthetic erythromycin derivative, belongs to a new chemical class of antibiotics called ketolides. Ketolides have been recently added to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin class of antibiotics. Similar to the macrolide antibiotics, telithromycin prevents bacterial growth by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. Telithromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the 70S bacterial ribosome and blocks further peptide elongation. Binding occurs simultaneously at to two domains of 23S RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit, domain II and V, where older macrolides bind only to one. It is used to treat mild to moderate respiratory infections.
Telithromycin is a Ketolide Antibacterial.
Telithromycin is a ketolide, a novel form of macrolide antibiotic that is recommended for treatment of community acquired pneumonia. Telithromycin was approved for use in the United States in 2004 and subsequently linked to several cases of severe drug induced liver injury.
TELITHROMYCIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2001 and has 8 approved and 5 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA.
