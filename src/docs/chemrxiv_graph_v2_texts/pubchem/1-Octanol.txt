Octan-1-ol is an octanol carrying the hydroxy group at position 1. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antifungal agent, a kairomone, a fuel additive and a bacterial metabolite. It is an octanol and a primary alcohol.
Caprylic alcohol has been used in trials studying the treatment of Essential Tremor.
1-Octanol has been reported in Senegalia berlandieri, Alpinia latilabris, and other organisms with data available.
OCTANOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II and has 1 investigational indication.
octan-1-ol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A colorless, slightly viscous liquid used as a defoaming or wetting agent. It is also used as a solvent for protective coatings, waxes, and oils, and as a raw material for plasticizers. (From McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 5th ed)
