Name: Acetoin
Text:
Acetyl methyl carbinol appears as a light-yellow colored liquid that can form a crystalline solid when it dimerizes. Slightly denser than water. Hence sinks in water. Used to make other chemicals.
Acetoin is a methyl ketone that is butan-2-one substituted by a hydroxy group at position 3. It has a role as a metabolite. It is a methyl ketone and a secondary alpha-hydroxy ketone.
Acetoin is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Acetoin has been reported in Francisella tularensis, Camellia sinensis, and other organisms with data available.
A product of fermentation. It is a component of the butanediol cycle in microorganisms. In mammals it is oxidized to carbon dioxide.
