Name: Nickel Carbonyl
Text:
Nickel Carbonyl can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts. It can cause developmental toxicity according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Nickel carbonyl appears as a clear colorless to yellow liquid. Boiling point 43 °C. Flash point below 0 °F. Very toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Carcinogenic. Denser than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Used to nickel coat steel and other metals and to make very pure nickel.
Nickel Carbonyl is a colorless, volatile and highly flammable, liquid inorganic compound with a characteristic, musty odor that emits toxic carbon monoxide fumes upon heating. Nickel carbonyl is primarily used for nickel coatings and to manufacture high-purity nickel powder. Exposure to this substance can cause severe dermatitis, skin and asthma-like allergies and affects the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and neurological system. Nickel carbonyl is a known carcinogen and is associated with an increased risk of developing lung and nasal cancers. (NCI05)
Nickel tetracarbonyl Ni(CO)4 is an organometallic compound of nickel. Its volatility at room temperature and toxicity have earned the compound the nickname liquid death. This pale-yellow liquid is the principal carbonyl of nickel. It is an intermediate in the Mond process for the purification of nickel and a reagent in organometallic chemistry. Nickel carbonyl is one of the most toxic substances encountered in industrial processes.Nickel is a chemical compound with the atomic number 28. It is found abundantly in nature in laterite ore minerals, such as limonite, garnierite, and pentlandite. Nickel has a biological role and is found in certain enzymes, including urease, hydrogenase, methylcoenzyme M reductase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. (L40, L41, L508)
