Name: Sulfuryl fluoride
Text:
Sulfuryl fluoride appears as a colorless odorless gas. Shipped as a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure. Noncombustible. Heavier than air. Very toxic by inhalation. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Prolonged exposure to heat can cause containers to rupture violently and rocket. Used as an insecticide fumigant in wooden structures to control termites and wood-infesting beetles, and used in organic synthesis.
Sulfuryl difluoride is a sulfuryl halide. It has a role as a fumigant insecticide.
