Name: N-Methylformamide
Text:
N-methylformamide is a clear colorless liquid with a slight amine odor. (NTP, 1992)
N-methylformamide is a member of the class of formamides having a N-methyl substituent. It is functionally related to a formamide.
N-Methylformamide has been reported in Erythrophyllum delesserioides with data available.
N-Methylformamide is a water-soluble organic solvent.  As an adjuvant antineoplastic agent, N-methylformamide depletes cellular glutathione, a key molecule involved in the antioxidation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free radicals, thereby enhancing ionizing radiation-induced DNA cross-linking in and terminal differentiation of tumor cells.
