Menthol has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Solanum tuberosum, and other organisms with data available.
Menthol is an organic compound made synthetically or obtained from peppermint or mint oils with flavoring and local anesthetic properties. When added to pharmaceuticals and foods, menthol functions as a fortifier for peppermint flavors. It also has a counterirritant effect on skin and mucous membranes, thereby producing a local analgesic or anesthetic effect.
