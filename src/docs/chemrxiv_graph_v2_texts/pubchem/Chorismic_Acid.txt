Name: Chorismic Acid
Text:
Chorismic acid is the (3R,4R)-stereoisomer of 5-[(1-carboxyethenyl)oxy]-6-hydroxycyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxylic acid. It has a role as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a chorismate(2-).
Chorismate is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Chorismic acid has been reported in Phycomyces blakesleeanus, Galium mollugo, and other organisms with data available.
Chorismate is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A cyclohexadiene carboxylic acid derived from SHIKIMIC ACID and a precursor for the biosynthesis of UBIQUINONE and the AROMATIC AMINO ACIDS.
