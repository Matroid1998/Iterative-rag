Name: Nitroethane
Text:
Nitroethane appears as a colorless oily liquid with a pleasant odor. Flash point of 82 °F. Decomposes above 350 °F. Density 1.052 g / cm3. Vapors much heavier than air. and insoluble in water. Vapors may irritate skin, eyes and mucous membranes. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. Used as a propellant and as a solvent.
Nitroethane is a nitroalkane that is ethane substituted by a nitro group. It is a tautomer of an aci-nitroethane.
