Name: Gallic Acid
Text:
Gallic acid is an odorless white solid. Sinks in water. (USCG, 1999)
Gallic acid is a trihydroxybenzoic acid in which the hydroxy groups are at positions 3, 4, and 5. It has a role as an astringent, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a plant metabolite, an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, a human xenobiotic metabolite, an EC 1.13.11.33 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and a geroprotector. It is a conjugate acid of a gallate.
Gallic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Gallic Acid has been reported in Persicaria muricata, Camellia sinensis, and other organisms with data available.
Gallic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A colorless or slightly yellow crystalline compound obtained from nutgalls. It is used in photography, pharmaceuticals, and as an analytical reagent.
