Name: Guanine
Text:
Guanine is a 2-aminopurine carrying a 6-oxo substituent. It has a role as a human metabolite, an algal metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a purine nucleobase, an oxopurine and a member of 2-aminopurines. It derives from a hydride of a 9H-purine.
Guanine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Guanine has been reported in Daphnia pulex, Glycine max, and other organisms with data available.
Guanine is a purine base that is a constituent of nucleotides occurring in nucleic acids.
GUANINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 15 investigational indications.
Guanine is a mineral with formula of C5H3(NH2)N4O. The corresponding IMA (International Mineralogical Association) number is IMA1973-056. The IMA symbol is Gni.
Guanine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
