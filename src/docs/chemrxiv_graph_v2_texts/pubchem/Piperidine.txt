Name: Piperidine
Text:
Piperidine appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pepper-like odor. Less dense than water, but miscible in water. Will float on water. Flash point 37 °F. Melting point -15.8 °F (-9 °C). Boiling point 222.8 °F (106 °C). May severely irritate skin and eyes. May be toxic by ingestion and inhalation. Vapors heavier than air. Used to make rubber and as a solvent.
Piperidine is an azacycloalkane that is cyclohexane in which one of the carbons is replaced by a nitrogen. It is a metabolite of cadaverine, a polyamine found in the human intestine. It has a role as a reagent, a protic solvent, a base, a catalyst, a plant metabolite, a human metabolite and a non-polar solvent. It is a saturated organic heteromonocyclic parent, an azacycloalkane, a secondary amine and a member of piperidines. It is a conjugate base of a piperidinium.
Piperidine has been reported in Cannabis sativa, Euglena gracilis, and other organisms with data available.
Piperidine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
