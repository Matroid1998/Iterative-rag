Name: Galunisertib
Text:
LY-2157299 is a pyrrolopyrazole that is 5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-b]pyrazole which is substituted at positions 2 and 3 by 6-methylpyridin-2-yl and 6-(aminocarbonyl)quinolin-4-yl groups, respectively. A Transforming growth factor-betaRI (TGF-betaRI) kinase inhibitor, it blocks TGF-beta-mediated tumor growth in glioblastoma. It has a role as a TGFbeta receptor antagonist and an antineoplastic agent. It is a member of quinolines, a pyrrolopyrazole, a member of methylpyridines, an aromatic amide and a monocarboxylic acid amide.
Galunisertib has been used in trials studying the basic science and treatment of Glioma, Neoplasms, Solid Tumor, GLIOBLASTOMA, and Prostate Cancer, among others.
Galunisertib is an orally available, small molecule antagonist of the tyrosine kinase transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) receptor type 1 (TGFBR1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, galunisertib specifically targets and binds to the kinase domain of TGFBR1, thereby preventing the activation of TGF-b-mediated signaling pathways. This may inhibit the proliferation of TGF-b-overexpressing tumor cells. Dysregulation of the TGF-b signaling pathway is seen in a number of cancers and is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor progression.
GALUNISERTIB is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 12 investigational indications.
