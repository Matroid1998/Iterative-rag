Name: Propyl Gallate
Text:
Propyl gallate appears as fine white to creamy-white crystalline powder. Odorless or with a faint odor. Melting point 150 Â°C. Insoluble in water. Slightly bitter taste.
N-propyl gallate is a trihydroxybenzoic acid.
Propyl Gallate is under investigation in clinical trial NCT01450098 (A Study of LY2484595 in Healthy Subjects).
Propyl gallate has been reported in Zea mays, Alchornea glandulosa, and Mangifera indica with data available.
PROPYL GALLATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of I.
Propyl gallate is found in corn. Propyl gallate is an antioxidant used in foods especially animal fats and vegetable oils. Synergistic with other antioxidants such as Butylated hydroxyanisole <ht>DNB28-K</ht> and 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol <ht>HCH42-H</ht>. Especially effective with polyunsaturated fats. Indirect food additive arising from paper or board packaging, adhesives and food contact polymers Propyl gallate is an anti-oxidant. It protects against oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and oxygen free radicals, in a catalytic manner similar to superoxide dismutase. Propyl gallate, or propyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate is an ester formed by the condensation of gallic acid and propanol. It is an antioxidant added to foods containing oils and fats to prevent oxidation.[citation needed] As a food additive, it is used under the E number E310.

Propyl gallate has been shown to exhibit pro-oxidant and radical scavenger functions (A7908, A7909).
Antioxidant for foods, fats, oils, ethers, emulsions, waxes, and transformer oils.
