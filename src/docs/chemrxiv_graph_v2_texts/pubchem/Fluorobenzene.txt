Name: Fluorobenzene
Text:
Fluorobenzene appears as a clear, colorless liquid with a characteristic aromatic odor. About the same density as water. Flash point 5 Â°F. Vapors heavier than air. May irritate the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Used as an insecticide, larvacide and as a reagent for plastic or resin polymers.
Monofluorobenzene is the simplest member of the class of monofluorobenzenes that is benzene carrying a single fluoro substituent. It has a role as a NMR chemical shift reference compound.
Derivatives of BENZENE that contain FLUORINE.
