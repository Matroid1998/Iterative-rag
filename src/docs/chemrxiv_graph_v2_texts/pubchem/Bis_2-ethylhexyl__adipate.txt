Name: Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate
Text:
Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate is a colorless to straw-colored liquid with a mild odor. Floats on water. (USCG, 1999)
Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate is a diester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy groups of adipic acid with 2-ethylhexan-1-ol. It is used as a plasticiser in the preparation of various polymers. It has a role as a plasticiser. It is a diester, a carboxylic ester and a member of dicarboxylic acids and O-substituted derivatives. It is functionally related to a 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and an adipic acid.
Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate has been reported in Panax ginseng with data available.
