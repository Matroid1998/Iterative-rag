Name: Cuprous chloride
Text:
Copper(I) chloride is an inorganic chloride of copper in which the metal is in the +1 oxidation state. It has a role as a molluscicide and an agrochemical. It is an inorganic chloride and a copper molecular entity. It contains a copper(1+).
Copper(I) chloride is a chloride of copper that occurs naturally as the rare mineral nantokite. The main use of copper(I) chloride is as a precursor to the fungicide copper oxychloride. It is also used in organic and polymer chemistry. Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. Copper is an essential elements in plants and animals as it is required for the normal functioning of more than 30 enzymes. It occurs naturally throughout the environment in rocks, soil, water, and air. (L277, L278, L292)
