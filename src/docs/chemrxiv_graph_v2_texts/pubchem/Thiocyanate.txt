Name: Thiocyanate
Text:
Thiocyanate is a pseudohalide anion obtained by deprotonation of the thiol group of thiocyanic acid. It has a role as a human metabolite. It is a pseudohalide anion and a sulfur molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an isothiocyanic acid and a thiocyanic acid.
Thiocyanate is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Thiocyanate is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
