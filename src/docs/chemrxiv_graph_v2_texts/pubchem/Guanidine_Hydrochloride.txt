Name: Guanidine Hydrochloride
Text:
Guanidine Hydrochloride is the hydrochloride salt form of guanidine, a strong basic compound with parasympathomimetic activity. Guanidine hydrochloride enhances the release of acetylcholine following a nerve impulse and potentiates acetylcholine actions on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. It also appears to slow the rates of depolarization and repolarization of muscle cell membranes. (NCI05)
GUANIDINE HYDROCHLORIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1939 and has 3 approved indications.
A strong organic base existing primarily as guanidium ions at physiological pH. It is found in the urine as a normal product of protein metabolism. It is also used in laboratory research as a protein denaturant. (From Martindale, the Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed and Merck Index, 12th ed) It is also used in the treatment of myasthenia and as a fluorescent probe in HPLC.
