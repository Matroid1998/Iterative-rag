Name: Lactucin
Text:
Lactucin is an azulenofuran that is 3-methylidene-3,3a,4,5,9a,9b-hexahydroazuleno[4,5-b]furan-2,7-dione carrying additional hydroxy, methyl and hydroxymethyl substituents at positions 4, 6 and 9 respectively (the 3aR,4S,9aS,9bR-diastereomer). Found in chicory. It has a role as an antimalarial, a sedative and a plant metabolite. It is a sesquiterpene lactone, an azulenofuran, a cyclic terpene ketone, an enone, a primary alcohol and a secondary alcohol.
Lactucin has been reported in Lactuca saligna, Picris hieracioides, and other organisms with data available.
