Name: Piperine
Text:
Piperine is a N-acylpiperidine that is piperidine substituted by a (1E,3E)-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-5-oxopenta-1,3-dien-5-yl group at the nitrogen atom. It is an alkaloid isolated from the plant Piper nigrum. It has a role as a NF-kappaB inhibitor, a plant metabolite, a food component and a human blood serum metabolite. It is a member of benzodioxoles, a N-acylpiperidine, a piperidine alkaloid and a tertiary carboxamide. It is functionally related to an (E,E)-piperic acid.
Bioperine has been used in trials studying the treatment of Multiple Myeloma and Deglutition Disorders.
Piperine has been reported in Periconia, Piper khasianum, and other organisms with data available.
PIPERINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.
