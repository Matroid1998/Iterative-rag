Glyoxylic acid is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid bearing an oxo group at the alpha carbon atom. It has a role as a human metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a 2-oxo monocarboxylic acid and an aldehydic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a glyoxylate.
Glyoxylic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Glyoxylic acid has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, and other organisms with data available.
Glyoxylic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
