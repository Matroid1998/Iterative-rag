Name: Potassium Phosphate, Dibasic
Text:
Dipotassium hydrogen phosphate is a potassium salt that is the dipotassium salt of phosphoric acid. It has a role as a buffer. It is a potassium salt and an inorganic phosphate.
Dipotassium phosphate (K2HPO4) is a highly water-soluble salt often used as a fertilizer and food additive as a source of phosphorus and potassium as well as a buffering agent.
Potassium Phosphate, Dibasic is the dipotassium form of phosphoric acid, that can be used as an electrolyte replenisher and with radio-protective activity. Upon oral administration, potassium phosphate is able to block the uptake of the radioactive isotope phosphorus P 32 (P-32).
POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DIBASIC is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and has 1 investigational indication.
