Name: 1-Hexanol
Text:
Hexanols appears as a clear colorless liquid mixture of isomeric six-carbon alcohols with similar chemical properties. Vapors are heavier than air. Used to make pharmaceuticals and as a solvent.
N-hexanol appears as a clear colorless liquid. Flash point 149 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air.
Hexan-1-ol is a primary alcohol that is hexane substituted by a hydroxy group at position 1. It has a role as a plant metabolite, an antibacterial agent, a fragrance and an alarm pheromone. It is a primary alcohol and a hexanol.
1-Hexanol has been reported in Magnolia officinalis, Pternistria bispina, and other organisms with data available.
1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH3(CH2)5OH. This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with ether and ethanol. Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol exist, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, both of which differ by the location of the hydroxyl group. Many isomeric alcohols have the formula C6H13OH. 1-hexanol is believed to be a component of the odour of freshly mown grass. It is used in the perfume industry.
1-Hexanol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
