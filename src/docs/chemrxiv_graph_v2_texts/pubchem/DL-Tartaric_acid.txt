Name: DL-Tartaric acid
Text:
2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid is a tetraric acid that is butanedioic acid substituted by hydroxy groups at positions 2 and 3. It has a role as a human xenobiotic metabolite and a plant metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a 3-carboxy-2,3-dihydroxypropanoate.
Tartaric acid has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Catunaregam spinosa, and other organisms with data available.
