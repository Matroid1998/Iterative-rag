Name: Coniferyl Alcohol
Text:
Coniferol is a phenylpropanoid that is one of the main monolignols, produced by the reduction of the carboxy functional group in cinnamic acid and the addition of a hydroxy and a methoxy substituent to the aromatic ring. It has a role as a monolignol, a mouse metabolite, a pheromone, an animal metabolite, a plant metabolite and a volatile oil component. It is a phenylpropanoid and a member of guaiacols. It is functionally related to an (E)-cinnamyl alcohol.
Coniferyl alcohol has been reported in Magnolia officinalis, Paecilomyces fulvus, and other organisms with data available.
