Name: Naphthalimide
Text:
1,8-Naphthalimide has been reported in Brickellia glutinosa with data available.
Compounds with three fused rings that appear like a naphthalene fused to piperidone or like a benz(de)isoquinoline-1,3-dione (not to be confused with BENZYLISOQUINOLINES which have a methyl separating the naphthyl from the benzyl rings). Members are CYTOTOXINS.
