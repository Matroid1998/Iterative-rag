Name: Boron tribromide
Text:
Boron tribromide appears as a colorless, fuming liquid with a pungent odor. Boiling point 194 °F. Freezing point -51 °F. Very toxic by inhalation. Corrosive to metals and tissue.
Boron tribromide is a chemical compound of boron  and bromine. It is a commercially available strong Lewis acid. Boron tribromide is an excellent demethylating or dealkylating agent for ethers and is often used in the production of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, it also finds applications in olefin polymerization and in Friedel-Crafts chemistry as a Lewis acid catalyst. The electronics industry uses boron tribromide as a boron source in pre-deposition processes for doping in the manufacture of semiconductors. Bromine is a halogen element with the symbol Br and atomic number 35. Diatomic bromine does not occur naturally, but bromine salts can be found in crustal rock. (L625, L642)
