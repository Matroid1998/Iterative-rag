Text:
Silver trifluoromethanesulfonate, or silver triflate, is the triflate salt of silver. It is used in inorganic and organometallic chemistry to replace halide anions or ligands. Silver is a metallic element with the chemical symbol Ag and atomic number 47. It occurs naturally in its pure, free form, as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. (L808, L809, L833)
