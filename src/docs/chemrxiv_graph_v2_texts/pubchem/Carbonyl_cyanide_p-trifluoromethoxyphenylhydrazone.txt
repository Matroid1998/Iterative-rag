Name: Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
Text:
Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone is a hydrazone that is hydrazonomalononitrile in which one of the hydrazine hydrogens is substituted by a p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl group. It has a role as an ionophore, an ATP synthase inhibitor and a geroprotector. It is a hydrazone, a nitrile, an organofluorine compound and an aromatic ether. It is functionally related to a hydrazonomalononitrile.
Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone has been reported in Purpureocillium lilacinum and Microcoleus autumnalis with data available.
Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone is a chemical compound of cyanide.
A proton ionophore that is commonly used as an uncoupling agent in biochemical studies.
