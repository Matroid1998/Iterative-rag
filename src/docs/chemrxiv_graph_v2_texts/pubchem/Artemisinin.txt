(+)-artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone obtained from sweet wormwood, Artemisia annua, which is used as an antimalarial for the treatment of multi-drug resistant strains of falciparum malaria. It has a role as an antimalarial and a plant metabolite. It is a sesquiterpene lactone and an organic peroxide.
Artemisinin has been used in trials studying the treatment of Schizophrenia, Malaria, Falciparum, and Plasmodium Falciparum.
Artemisinin has been reported in Artemisia lancea, Artemisia annua, and other organisms with data available.
