Name: Lipoamide
Text:
Lipoamide is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of lipoic acid with ammonia. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a member of dithiolanes and a monocarboxylic acid amide. It is functionally related to a lipoic acid.
Lipoamide is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Lipoamide has been reported in Homo sapiens, Apis cerana, and other organisms with data available.
lipoamide is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
