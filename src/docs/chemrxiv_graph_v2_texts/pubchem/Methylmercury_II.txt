Name: Methylmercury II
Text:
Methylmercury(1+) is a methylmercury compound.
Methylmercury is an organometallic cation. It is formed by the burning of wastes and fossil fuels containing inorganic mercury, as well as by the action of anaerobic organisms on inorganic mercury. It is particularily hazardous due to its ability to bioaccumulate in the environment, particularily in aquatic systems. (L260)
