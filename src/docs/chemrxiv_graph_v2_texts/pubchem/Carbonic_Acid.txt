Name: Carbonic Acid
Text:
Carbonic acid is a carbon oxoacid and a chalcocarbonic acid. It has a role as a mouse metabolite. It is a conjugate acid of a hydrogencarbonate.
Carbonic acid is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Oxonioformate has been reported in Homo sapiens with data available.
BICARBONATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 4 investigational indications.
Carbonic acid (H2C03). The hypothetical acid of carbon dioxide and water. It exists only in the form of its salts (carbonates), acid salts (hydrogen carbonates), amines (carbamic acid), and acid chlorides (carbonyl chloride). (From Grant and Hackh's Chemical Dictionary, 5th ed)
