Name: Mecoprop
Text:
Mecoprop appears as colorless crystals. Corrosive to metals. Used as an herbicide.
2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propanoic acid is a monocarboxylic acid that is lactic acid in which the hydroxyl hydrogen is replaced by a 4-chloro-2-methylphenyl group. It is an aromatic ether, a monocarboxylic acid and a member of monochlorobenzenes. It is functionally related to a rac-lactic acid.
Mecoprop, or methylchlorophenoxypropionic acid (MCPP), is a common general use herbicide found in many household weed killers and weed-and-feed type lawn fertilizers. It is primarily used to control broadleaf weeds. It is often used in combination with other chemically related herbicides such as 2,4-D, dicamba, and MCPA.The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified mecoprop as toxicity class III - slightly toxic. Mecoprop is a mixture of two stereoisomers, with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer ('Mecoprop-P', 'Duplosan KV') possessing the herbicidal activity
