Name: Guanosine Triphosphate
Text:
GTP is a guanosine 5'-phosphate and a purine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate. It has a role as an Escherichia coli metabolite, a mouse metabolite and an uncoupling protein inhibitor. It is a conjugate acid of a GTP(3-).
Guanosine triphosphate is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Guanosine-5'-triphosphate has been reported in Helianthus tuberosus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.
Guanosine Triphosphate is a purine nucleotide triphosphate comprised of a guanine and a triphosphate moiety bound to a ribose moiety at its 1' and 5' sites, respectively. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) can be utilized as a substrate for nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) synthesis, as an energy source for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis, and as a signaling molecule.
GTP is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Guanosine 5'-(tetrahydrogen triphosphate). A guanine nucleotide containing three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety.
