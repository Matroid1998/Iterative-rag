Name: Dimethyl terephthalate
Text:
Dimethyl terephthalate appears as white solid or heated colorless liquid. Has no odor. Liquid solidifies in cool water. Solid and liquid sink in water. (USCG, 1999)
Dimethyl terephthalate is a diester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy groups of terephthalic acid with methanol. It is a primary ingredient widely used in the manufacture of polyesters and industrial plastics. It is a methyl ester, a diester and a phthalate ester. It is functionally related to a terephthalic acid.
Dimethyl terephthalate has been reported in Abies pindrow, Uncaria elliptica, and other organisms with data available.
