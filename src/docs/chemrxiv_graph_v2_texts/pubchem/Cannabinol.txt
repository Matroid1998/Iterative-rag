Cannabinol is a dibenzopyran.
Cannabinol (CBN) is a physiologically inactive constituent of Cannabis sativa.
Cannabinol has been reported in Cannabis sativa with data available.
Cannabinol is a cannabinoid isolated from the plant Cannabis that is a metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with potential immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities. Cannabinol preferentially binds to the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptor CB2, which is mainly expressed on a variety of immune cells, such as T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Stimulation of CB2 receptors by cannabinol may both trigger apoptosis in these cells and inhibit the production of a variety of cytokines. Cannabinol exerts minimal affinity for CB1 and has a weak effect on the central nervous system.
CANNABINOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III (across all indications) and has 50 investigational indications.
A physiologically inactive constituent of Cannabis sativa L.
