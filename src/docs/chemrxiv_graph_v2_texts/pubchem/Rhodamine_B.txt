D&C Red No. 19 can cause cancer according to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
C.i. food red 15 appears as green crystals or reddish-violet powder. Used as a dye, especially for paper, as a metal chelating reagent, and in drugs and cosmetics.
Rhodamine B is an organic chloride salt having N-[9-(2-carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-3H-xanthen-3-ylidene]-N-ethylethanaminium as the counterion. An amphoteric dye commonly used as a fluorochrome. It has a role as a fluorochrome, a fluorescent probe and a histological dye. It is an organic chloride salt and a xanthene dye. It contains a rhodamine B(1+).
Rhodamine is a class of xanthene derivatives with fluorescent properties that are used as tracer dyes in a wide variety of industrial and laboratory applications.
