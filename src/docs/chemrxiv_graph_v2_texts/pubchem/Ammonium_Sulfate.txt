Name: Ammonium Sulfate
Text:
Ammonium sulfate is a white odorless solid. Sinks and dissolves in water. (USCG, 1999)
Ammonium sulfate is an inorganic sulfate salt obtained by reaction of sulfuric acid with two equivalents of ammonia. A high-melting (decomposes above 280℃) white solid which is very soluble in water (70.6 g/100 g water at 0℃; 103.8 g/100 g water at 100℃), it is widely used as a fertilizer for alkaline soils. It has a role as a fertilizer. It is an ammonium salt and an inorganic sulfate salt.
Mascagnite is a mineral with formula of (N3-H4)2S6+O4 or (NH4)2(SO4). The IMA symbol is Msc.
Sulfuric acid diammonium salt. It is used in CHEMICAL FRACTIONATION of proteins.
