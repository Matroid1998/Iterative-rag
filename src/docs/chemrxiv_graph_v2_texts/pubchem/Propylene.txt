Name: Propylene
Text:
Propylene is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum like odor. It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure. For transportation it may be stenched. Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite. It is easily ignited. The vapors are heavier than air. Any leak can either be liquid or vapor. It can asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may rupture violently and rocket. It is used to make other chemicals. Can cause explosion.
Propene is an alkene that is propane with a double bond at position 1. It has a role as a refrigerant and a xenobiotic. It is an alkene and a gas molecular entity.
Propylene has been reported in Senna sophera with data available.
