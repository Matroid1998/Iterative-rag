Name: Decane
Text:
N-decane appears as a colorless liquid. Flash point 115 Â°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. In high concentrations its vapors may be narcotic. Used as a solvent and to make other chemicals.
Decane is a straight-chain alkane with 10 carbon atoms.
Decane has been reported in Aristolochia triangularis, Gymnodinium nagasakiense, and other organisms with data available.
N-Decane is found in common oregano. Decane is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)8CH3. 75 isomers of decane exist, all of which are flammable liquids. N-Decane belongs to the family of Acyclic Alkanes. These are acyclic hydrocarbons consisting only of n carbon atoms and m hydrogen atoms where m=2*n + 2.
