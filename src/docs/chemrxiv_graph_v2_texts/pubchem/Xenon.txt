Name: Xenon
Text:
Xenon appears as a colorless odorless gas. Noncombustible. Heavier than air. May asphyxiate by the displacement of air. Under prolonged exposure to fire or heat containers may rupture violently and rocket.
Xenon, refrigerated liquid (cryogenic liquid) appears as a colorless odorless nonflammable cold liquid. Boils at -150 Â°F. Contact with the liquid may cause frost bite. Can asphyxiate by displacing air in enclosed spaces. Exposure of the container to prolonged heat or fire may cause it to rupture violently and rocket. Used to make flash bulbs for photography.
