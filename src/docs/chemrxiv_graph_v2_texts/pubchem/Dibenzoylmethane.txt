Name: Dibenzoylmethane
Text:
Dibenzoylmethane is a beta-diketone that is acetylacetone (acac) in which both methyl groups have been replaced by phenyl groups. It is a minor constituent of the root extract of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) and exhibits antimutagenic and anticancer effects. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent, a metabolite and an antimutagen. It is a beta-diketone and an aromatic ketone.
Dibenzoylmethane has been reported in Acca sellowiana with data available.
