Name: Trapoxin A
Text:
Trapoxin A is a homodetic cyclic tetrapeptide constructed from L-phenylalanyl (x2), D-pipecolinyl and L-2-amino-8-oxo-9,10-epoxydecanoyl residues. It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an antineoplastic agent and a fungal metabolite. It is a homodetic cyclic peptide, an epoxide and a ketone.
trapoxin A has been reported in Helicoma ambiens with data available.
Trapoxin is an epoxide-containing cyclotetrapeptide with antitumor activity.  It is an irreversible inhibitor of histone deacetylase.
