Name: 2'-Deoxyadenosine
Text:
2'-deoxyadenosine is a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside having adenine as the nucleobase. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a purines 2'-deoxy-D-ribonucleoside and a purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside.
Deoxyadenosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
2'-Deoxyadenosine has been reported in Fritillaria przewalskii, Homo sapiens, and other organisms with data available.
2'-deoxyadenosine is a purine nucleoside component of DNA comprised of adenosine linked by its N9 nitrogen to the C1 carbon of deoxyribose.
Deoxyadenosine is a derivative of nucleoside adenosine. It is comprised of adenine attached to a deoxyribose moiety via a N9-glycosidic bond. Deoxyribose differs from ribose by the absence of oxygen in the 3' position of its ribose ring. Deoxyadenosine is a critical component of DNA.
2'-Deoxyadenosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
