Name: Tapinarof
Text:
Benvitimod is a stilbenoid.
Tapinarof is a novel, first-in-class, small-molecule AhR agonist that is indicated for the treatment of adult psoriasis. It is available as a topical cream to be applied to the affected area once daily. Tapiranof was first discovered as a metabolite (3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene) produced in Photorhabdus luminescens, a gram-negative bacillus that lives symbiotically with the Heterorhabditis nematodes. In 1959, it was noticed that Heterorhabditis with a high amount of 3,5-dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene did not putrefy once dead, thus suggesting its potential anti-inflammatory activity.   Tapinarof received initial approval from the FDA in 2022.
Tapinarof is an Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Agonist. The mechanism of action of tapinarof is as an Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Agonist.
3,5-Dihydroxy-4-isopropylstilbene has been reported in Photorhabdus luminescens with data available.
TAPINAROF is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2022 and is indicated for psoriasis and has 1 investigational indication.
