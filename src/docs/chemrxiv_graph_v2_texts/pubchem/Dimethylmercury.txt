Name: Dimethylmercury
Text:
Dimethylmercury is a methylmercury compound. It has a role as a NMR chemical shift reference compound.
Dimethyl mercury is an organomercuric compound. It is often considered to be the most dangerous mercury compound due to its strong neurotixic effects. Dimethyl mercury has a slightly sweet smell and tends to bioaccumulate due to its slow metabolic elimination rate. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block metal and one of six elements that are liquid at or near room temperature and pressure. It is a naturally occuring substance, and combines with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen to form inorganic mercury compounds (salts). Mercury also combines with carbon to make organic mercury compounds. (L1, L261)
