Name: Lasalocid
Text:
Lasalocid is a polyether antibiotic used for prevention and treatment of coccidiosis in poultry. It has a role as a coccidiostat, a bacterial metabolite and an ionophore. It is a monohydroxybenzoic acid, a beta-hydroxy ketone, a secondary alcohol, a member of oxolanes, a monocarboxylic acid, a member of oxanes, a tertiary alcohol and a polyether antibiotic. It is a conjugate acid of a lasalocid(1-).
Lasalocid is an agent that presents antibacterial and coccidiostat activities. It is produced by strains of Streptomyces lasaliensis.
Lasalocid has been reported in Streptomyces with data available.
LASALOCID is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
Cationic ionophore antibiotic obtained from Streptomyces lasaliensis that, among other effects, dissociates the calcium fluxes in muscle fibers. It is used as a coccidiostat, especially in poultry.
