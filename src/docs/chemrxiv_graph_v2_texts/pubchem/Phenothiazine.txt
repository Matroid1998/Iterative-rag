Phenothiazine is a light green to steel-blue powder. Acquires a greenish-brown tint under exposure to sunlight. (NTP, 1992)
10H-phenothiazine is the 10H-tautomer of phenothiazine. It has a role as a plant metabolite, a radical scavenger and a ferroptosis inhibitor. It is a tautomer of a 4aH-phenothiazine, a 1H-phenothiazine and a 3H-phenothiazine.
Phenothiazine (PTZ) is an organic thiazine compound.
Phenothiazine has been reported in Mimosa pudica with data available.
Phenothiazine is a class of agents exhibiting antiemetic, antipsychotic, antihistaminic, and anticholinergic activities.  Phenothiazines antagonize the dopamine D2-receptor in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain, potentially preventing chemotherapy-induced emesis.  In addition, these agents have peripherally or centrally antagonistic activity against alpha adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors. (NCI)
PHENOTHIAZINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.
