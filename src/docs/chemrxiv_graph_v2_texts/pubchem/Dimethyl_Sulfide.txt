Name: Dimethyl Sulfide
Text:
Dimethyl sulfide appears as a clear colorless to straw colored liquid with a disagreeable odor. Flash point less than 0 Â°F. Less dense than water and slightly soluble in water. Vapors are heavier than air.
Dimethyl sulfide is a methyl sulfide in which the sulfur atom is substituted by two methyl groups. It is produced naturally by some marine algae. It has a role as a bacterial xenobiotic metabolite, a marine metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, an algal metabolite and an Escherichia coli metabolite.
Dimethyl sulfide is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Dimethyl sulfide has been reported in Tuber melanosporum, Solanum tuberosum, and other organisms with data available.
Dimethyl sulfide is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
