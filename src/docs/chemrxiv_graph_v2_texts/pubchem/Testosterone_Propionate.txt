Testosterone propionate is a steroid ester.
Testosterone propionate is a slower-releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17Î² propionate ester of testosterone. Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974. Currently, this drug has been discontinued in humans, but the vet application is still available as an OTC.
Testosterone Propionate is a short acting oil-based injectable formulation of testosterone.  Testosterone inhibits gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland and ablates estrogen production in the ovaries, thereby decreasing endogenous estrogen levels.  In addition, this agent promotes the maintenance of male sex characteristics and is indicated for testosterone replacement in hypogonadal males. (NCI04)
