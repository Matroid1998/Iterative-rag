Name: Glycolaldehyde
Text:
Glycolaldehyde is the glycolaldehyde derived from ethylene glycol. The parent of the class of glycolaldehydes. It has a role as a fundamental metabolite and a human metabolite. It is a tautomer of a (Z)-1,2-ethenediol.
Glycolaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).
Glycolaldehyde has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana and Homo sapiens with data available.
Glycolaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
