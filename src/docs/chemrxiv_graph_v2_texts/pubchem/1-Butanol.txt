Name: 1-Butanol
Text:
N-butyl alcohol is a colorless liquid. Used in organic chemical synthesis, plasticizers, detergents, etc.
Butan-1-ol is a primary alcohol that is butane in which a hydrogen of one of the methyl groups is substituted by a hydroxy group. It it produced in small amounts in humans by the gut microbes. It has a role as a protic solvent, a human metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a primary alcohol, a short-chain primary fatty alcohol and an alkyl alcohol.
1-Butanol has been reported in Zea mays, Zingiber mioga, and other organisms with data available.
1-Butanol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
A four carbon linear hydrocarbon that has a hydroxy group at position 1.
