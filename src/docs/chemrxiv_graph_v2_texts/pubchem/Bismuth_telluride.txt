Name: Bismuth telluride
Text:
Bismuth telluride appears as gray or black hexagonal platelets with a metallic luster or gray powder. mp: 586 Â°C. Density: 7.8 g/cm3. An alloy of two metallic elements. Sometimes this is doped with selenium sulfide. The selenium sulfide (SeS) dopant alters the electrical properties, but has too low a concentration to affect the chemical properties.
Tetradymite is a mineral with formula of Bi3+2Te2-2S2- or Bi2Te2S. The IMA symbol is Ttd.
