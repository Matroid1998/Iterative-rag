Name: Phenylephrine
Text:
Phenylephrine is a member of the class of the class of phenylethanolamines that is (1R)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylethan-1-ol carrying an additional hydroxy substituent at position 3 on the phenyl ring. It has a role as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a cardiotonic drug, a mydriatic agent, a protective agent, a vasoconstrictor agent, a sympathomimetic agent and a nasal decongestant. It is a member of phenylethanolamines, a secondary amino compound and a member of phenols. It is a conjugate base of a phenylephrine(1+).
Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat hypotension, dilate the pupil, and induce local vasoconstriction. The action of phenylephrine, or neo-synephrine, was first described in literature in the 1930s.  Phenylephrine was granted FDA approval in 1939.
Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 Adrenergic Agonist. The mechanism of action of phenylephrine is as an Adrenergic alpha1-Agonist.
Phenylephrine is a direct-acting sympathomimetic amine chemically related to adrenaline and ephedrine with potent vasoconstrictor property. Phenylephrine is a post-synaptic alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist that causes vasoconstriction, increases systolic/diastolic pressures, reflex bradycardia, and stroke output.
PHENYLEPHRINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1952 and has 13 approved and 33 investigational indications.
An alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used as a mydriatic, nasal decongestant, and cardiotonic agent.
