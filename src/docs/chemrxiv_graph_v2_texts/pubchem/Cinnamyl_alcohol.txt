Name: Cinnamyl alcohol
Text:
Cinnamyl alcohol is a primary alcohol comprising an allyl core with a hydroxy substituent at the 1-position and a phenyl substituent at the 3-position (geometry of the C=C bond unspecified). It has a role as a plant metabolite.
Cinnamyl alcohol is a naturally occurring compound that is found within cinnamon. Due to the low levels found in cinnamon, cinnamyl alcohol is usually supplied as [DB14184] within commercial products.  Cinnamyl alcohol has been shown to be a skin sensitizer, with a NOEL (No Effect Level) of ~4%. Sensitivity to cinnamyl alcohol may be identified with a clinical patch test.
Cinnamyl alcohol is a Standardized Chemical Allergen. The physiologic effect of cinnamyl alcohol is by means of Increased Histamine Release, and Cell-mediated Immunity.
Cinnamyl alcohol has been reported in Rhodiola sachalinensis, Cryptocarya amygdalina, and other organisms with data available.
