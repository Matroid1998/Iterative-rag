Name: Stevioside
Text:
Stevioside is a diterpene glycoside that is rubusoside in which the hydroxy group at position 2 of the allylic beta-D-glucoside has been converted to the corresponding beta-D-glucoside. It is a natural herbal sweetener that is 250-300 times sweeter than sucrose (though with a bitter aftertaste), extracted from the Stevia rebaudiana plant native to South America. It has a role as a sweetening agent, an antioxidant, an antineoplastic agent, a hypoglycemic agent, an anti-inflammatory agent and a plant metabolite. It is a diterpene glycoside, an ent-kaurane diterpenoid, a beta-D-glucoside, a tetracyclic diterpenoid and a bridged compound. It is functionally related to a steviol and a rubusoside.
Stevioside has been reported in Bos taurus, Asteraceae, and Stevia rebaudiana with data available.
