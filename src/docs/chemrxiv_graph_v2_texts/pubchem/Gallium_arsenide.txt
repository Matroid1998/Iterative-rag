Gallium arsenide is a chemical compound of gallium and arsenic. It is used to make devices such as microwave frequency integrated circuits, infrared light-emitting diodes, laser diodes and solar cells. It is also a semiconductor. Arsenic is a chemical element that has the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a poisonous metalloid that has many allotropic forms: yellow (molecular non-metallic) and several black and grey forms (metalloids) are a few that are seen. Three metalloidal forms of arsenic with different crystal structures are found free in nature (the minerals arsenopyrite and the much rarer arsenolamprite and pararsenolamprite), but it is more commonly found as a compound with other elements.
