Name: Thallium sulfate
Text:
Thallium sulfate appears as odorless white rhomboid prisms or a dense white powder. Density 6.77 g / cm3. Melting point 1170 °F (632 °C). Extremely toxic by ingestion. Very toxic by skin absorption and ingestion. A slow acting cumulative poison. Used as a rat poison, and an ant bait. Also used for analysis (testing for iodine in the presence of chlorine) and ozonometry. Not registered as a pesticide in the U.S.
Thallium sulfate is a metal sulfate in which the counterion is thallium and the ratio of thallium to sulfate is 2:1. It is a rodenticide used to control rats, squirrels, mice, moles, prairie dogs, ants and cockroaches. It is no longer registered for pesticide use in the United States. It has a role as a rodenticide and an insecticide. It is a thallium molecular entity and a metal sulfate. It contains a thallium(1+) and a sulfate.
