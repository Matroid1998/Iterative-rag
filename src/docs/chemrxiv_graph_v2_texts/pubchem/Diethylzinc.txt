Name: Diethylzinc
Text:
Diethylzinc is a pyrophoric liquid with a garlic-like odor. It is stable when it is shipped in sealed tubes with carbon dioxide. It may decompose violently in water and ignite spontaneously with air. It is toxic by ingestion. If exposed to heat or flame, containers of this material may explode. It is used as an aircraft fuel.
Diethylzinc is a dialkylzinc compound.
Diethylzinc is an organozinc compound. It is used as a reagent in organic chemistry and in liquid rocket fuel. Zinc is a metallic element with the atomic number 30. It is found in nature most often as the mineral sphalerite. Though excess zinc in harmful, in smaller amounts it is an essential element for life, as it is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes and is found in just as many transcription factors. (L48, L49, L82)
