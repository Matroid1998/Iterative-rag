Involved in electron transfer coupled spin transitions.

Switching is central to modern computer logic, displays and memory. Thus, the quest
for greater miniaturization and efficiency often focuses on switches, e.g., transistors. The
majority of the worlds data is currently stored in 600 hyperscale data centers, which each
consume hundreds of megawatts of electricity annually.1 So developing smaller, more efficient,
switches is an environmental, as well as a technological, priority. Several molecular switches have been explored including single molecule magnets,2 valance
tautomerism,3 electron transfer coupled spin transitions4 (in, e.g., Prussian blue analogues,5
molecular systems,6 and coordination polymers7), and spin crossover (SCO) materials.8 SCO
complexes display two spinstates; and are intrinsically multifunctional as changes in spin
state simultaneously lead to changes in electronic and magnetic properties, size and color.
