Description:
A lipid molecule used in the study of lipid bilayers.

Text:
Such understanding can be obtained through computational tools, but it is 
important that tools used depict the structure, dynamics, and function of lipid bilayers accurately. Accurate lipid models allow the reliable study of, for example, membranebound proteins, 
transport through membranes, and pharmacokinetics of drugs (4). Figure 1. Chemical structure of 1palmitoyl2oleylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) 
Why accurate force field parameters are important 

4 
Force field accuracy is of key importance in atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation 
methods. Atomistic MD enables studying systems of interest in life sciences by a balance between 
computing power and precision instead of the computationally heavy methods needed to describe 
quantum mechanical behavior, MD uses typically classical mechanics approximation (called force 
field) to reproduce molecular behavior.
