These models exploit the
ability of diffusion processes to capture longrange dependencies in complex molecular structures, allowing
the generation of diverse and chemically plausible molecules.10,11 In drug discovery and development, DMs
can accelerate innovation by learning latent representations of molecular structures, facilitating the genera
tion of novel compounds with desired traits such as high efficacy and low toxicity.12 In this context, DMs
have also been adapted to include the protein target binding pocket as a condition for the generation process,
allowing for modeling of proteinligand interactions.1315 Here, DMs for molecule discovery employ various
neural network architectures, such as graphneural networks (GNNs),1618 convolutional neural networks
(CNNs),19,20 transformers11,21,22 or combinations of them,23 and operate on different molecular represen
tations based on SMILES or molecular graphs.17,24 They can also integrate with reinforcement learning
strategies, directing synthesis towards molecules with specific properties, thereby enhancing the efficiency of
drug discovery efforts.2527 In addition to drug design, DMs have also been used to generate new polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons with defined electronic properties for optoelectronic applications.28 Further, DMs
are employed to predict chemical reactions by modeling how reactant molecules diffuse through a reaction
network.
