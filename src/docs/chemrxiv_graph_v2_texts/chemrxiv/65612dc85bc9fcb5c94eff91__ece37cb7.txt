Description:
A compound used in the modification of low-cost polymers with elemental sulfur.

Text:
To realize these benefits, 
readily accessible polymers that respond to such lowpower irradiation are required. Addressing these needs, this study describes the modification of lowcost polymers made 
from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene using low power 
continuous wave lasers with wavelengths of 532, 638, 690, and 786 nm. Polymers made from 
elemental sulfur have received increasing attention with the advent of inverse vulcanization8 
and related polymerization methods912 that convert this abundant and inexpensive feedstock 
into functional polysulfide materials.

A component used in the formation of a polymer with sulfur.

Text:
Here, we disclose this phenomenon for the first time and 
investigate it in detail for a range of laser systems. The direct modification for a related polymer 
made from sulfur and dicyclopentadiene was also studied.25, 26 The objective was to understand 
and control this process and use it for precision polymer modification. Methods are described 
for temporally and spatiallycontrolled swelling or ablation of the polymer surfaces, as well as 
efforts to thermally erase these modifications. These insights enabled a variety of novel
