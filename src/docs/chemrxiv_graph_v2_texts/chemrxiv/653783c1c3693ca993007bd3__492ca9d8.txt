Description:
An oxindole derivative developed as a marketed drug for various medical conditions.

Text:
Importantly, substituted oxindole derivatives exhibit selectivity towards protein 
kinases, VEGFR being the most investigated target 1315. A few critical US FDAapproved 
drugs that contain indoline2one are sunitinib, toceranib phosphate, and nitedanib. For GIST 
advanced renal cell carcinoma, sunitinib works by inhibiting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases 
16. Toceranib Phosphate for mast cell tumours 17. Nitedanib, an inhibitor of intracellular 
tyrosine kinase, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and nonsmall cell lung cancers 18. Several 
other oxindole derivatives, such as ropinirole, adibendan, indolidan, and ziprasidone, have been 
successfully developed as marketed drugs for various medical conditions 1922 (Figure 2). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023jhbh4 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000159735990 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
