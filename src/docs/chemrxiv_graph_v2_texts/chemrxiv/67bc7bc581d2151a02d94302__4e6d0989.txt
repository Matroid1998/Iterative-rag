Description:
An anode material classified as a critical raw material, accounting for 40% of LIBs by weight.

Text:
Another valuable component of endoflife LIBs is 
graphite (anode) which has been classified as a critical raw 
material.4 It accounts for 40  of LIBs by weight and recycling 
graphite has also gained traction recently.5 Recycling endoflife 
LIBs usually begins with the preparation of black mass, which is 
produced by safely discharging, shredding, grinding, and then 
milling the endoflife LIBs.6 Black mass (BM), a fine powder, 
contains valuables such as Li, Ni, Mn, Co, graphite, and small 
amounts of Al and Cu current collectors. Material characterization 
techniques are significant 
in 
developing sustainable and efficient pretreatment and 
recycling processes for endoflife LIBs.

Description:
A material whose particles are liberated during mechanical pretreatment methods such as ball milling.

These techniques offer 
critical insights into the physicochemical properties of valuables 
in BM and allow for investigating the effects of pretreatment 
and recycling processes, thereby providing a datadriven 
framework to design and optimize efficient recycling strategies. Pretreatment of BM is crucial due to the presence of impurities 
such as residual electrolytes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 
binder, carbon black, and other organic species deposited on 
the surface of cathode active material (CAM) and graphite.7 
Removal of PVDF binder is highly desirable as it can adversely 
affect recycling efficiency by depositing on the surface of CAM 
particles. Mechanical pretreatment methods such as ball 
milling are used to liberate the CAM and graphite particles,
