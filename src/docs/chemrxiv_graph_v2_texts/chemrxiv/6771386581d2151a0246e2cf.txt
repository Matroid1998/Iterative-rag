Description:
Used in nanoporous electrodes for electrochemical capacitors, influencing the electrochemical double layer structure.

Text:
Additionally, the compatibility of ionic radii and carbon pore size in electrochemical 
capacitor electrodes governs ion desolvation, influencing the electrochemical double layer 
(EDL) structure.1015 There is a lack of fundamental knowledge regarding ion electrosorption 
of waterinsalt electrolytes and their corresponding EDL structure within nanoporous carbon 
electrodes. The concept of the EDL began with Helmholtz in 1879,16,17 who described it as a simple 
capacitor formed by ions in the electrolyte aligning near a charged surface.
