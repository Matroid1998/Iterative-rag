Description:
A conventional ultra-high temperature ceramic material used for its mechanical properties and oxidation resistance.

Text:
In this regard, previous research 
on the development of fully sintered conventional UHTC materials (ZrB2, HfB2) directed the 
usage of secondary phases such as SiC, CNTs, MoSi2, TaSi2 to improve densification 
behaviour, mechanical properties as well as the oxidation resistance 1519. However, SiC has 
been reported to be best among them. Addition of SiC in different boride matrix have been
