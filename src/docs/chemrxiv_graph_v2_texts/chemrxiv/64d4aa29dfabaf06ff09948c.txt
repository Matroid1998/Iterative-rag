Description:
Used in the form of carbon dots with a low turnover number in photocatalytic systems.

Text:
However, such a photocatalytic system has thus far only 
been demonstrated using either toxic and expensive CdTe 
nanocrystals10 or carbon dots with a low turnover number (TON) 
of 20,000 over 24 h.11 Direct electron transfer (DET) between 
graphitic carbon nitride (gC3N4) and NiFeSeH2ase has been 
established with nonspecific interactions, resulting in a low 
turnover frequency (TOF) of 4,117 h1 over 4 h.12 Subsequent 
improvements involved the incorporation of a nondiffusional 
electron mediator, TiO2, between gC3N4 and NiFeSeH2ase, 
leading to an enhanced TON (4 h) of 80,000.13 In addition to its 
application in H2ase systems, CNX has predominantly been 
utilized for the regeneration of NADH in mediated electron transfer 
(MET) processes involving formate dehydrogenase14 or alcohol 
dehydrogenase.15 
In this work, we present a novel approach for biological integration 
with CNX by demonstrating the first instance of an electrostatic 
interaction with enzymes.
