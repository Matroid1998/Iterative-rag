Description:
Detection is influenced by charge transfer with the sensing layer affecting conductivity and photoluminescence.

The comparison becomes further complicated by sub
sequent attempts to improve the sensing characteristics. The gate bias
based solution has shown promising results for MoS2 20, MoSe2 21,
and MoTe2 18, but the voltage used varied between reports. Further
more, studies with sensor illumination have considered sheets of MoS2
22, 23 and MoTe2 19. However, they used different light sources
and intensities. Consequently, it is still unclear which layer holds the
greatest potential for detecting NO2. Sensor sensitivity is critically dependent on the charge transfer
(Q) between the analyte and the sensing layer. This process affects
properties that can be easily and precisely monitored, such as conduc
tivity and photoluminescence, enabling gas detection.
