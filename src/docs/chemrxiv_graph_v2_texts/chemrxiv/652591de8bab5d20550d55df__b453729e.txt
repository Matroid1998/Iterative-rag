Description:
Metal complexes that can be immobilized on high surface area carbons for catalysis.

Text:
For example, depending on the preparation, metal particles, oxides or 
sulfides are found.18 The overlay of several compounds hinders structureactivity correlations, which 
inturn impedes the development of more advanced catalysts.19,20 
Metal porphyrins immobilized on high surface area carbons (MPorphC) resemble, and thus could be 
used to mimic, the molecular MN4 centers embedded in the amorphous carbon backbone of MNC 
catalysts.2123 While there are several publications available in which the HER was explored for the 
homogeneous system, i.e. porphyrins solvated in an organic solvent,24,25 reports on heterogeneous HER 
electrocatalysis with immobilized porphyrins are rare. For heterogeneous catalysis systems in aqueous 
environment, HER electrocatalysis is described by two consecutive protoncoupled electron transfer 
(PCET) steps.
