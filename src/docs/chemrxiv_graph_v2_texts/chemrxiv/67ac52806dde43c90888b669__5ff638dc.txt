Description:
An FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor used as an anticancer drug.

Text:
Class IIa 
encompasses HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9, while class IIb includes HDAC6 and 10. Class III enzymes are the 
NADdependent sirtuins and contain seven isoforms (Sirt17). Finally, class IV comprises only one 
enzyme, which is HDAC11. The FDA approval of four HDAC inhibitors as anticancer drugs (vorinostat, 
panobinostat, belinostat, and romidepsin) has shown the great potential of HDAC inhibitors in oncology 
drug development.
