Description:
Can be used as a matrix of metallic nanoparticles or as an active catalyst.

Hybrid materials elaborations and
characterizations allow also the detection and quantification of organic compound in our food products, to limit
our exposure in some diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and so fourth 5,6. In fact, in the past few decades,
many engineering routes have been suggested and and thoroughly discussed in order to find superb materials for
considerable technological applications. So that, these ways include  the exploration of metal oxides materials
such Alumina, ceria, silica,Manganese oxides 7,9, they can be used as a matrix of metallic nanoparticles or as
an active catalyst. The development and characterization of many forms of carbons such as nanotubes,
nanofibers, polymers, heteroatomsincorporated carbons, black carbons, and so on, have severely discussed to
boost the performance of composite materials 10,14.
