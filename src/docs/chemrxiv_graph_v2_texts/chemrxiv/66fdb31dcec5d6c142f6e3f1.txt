Description:
Conjugates formed in the modification of protein N-termini with pyridinecarboxaldehydes.

These reactions 
are complicated by the ability of PCAs to form 
hydrates in the aqueous media used for protein 
modification. The nature of PCA functionalisation 
can significantly alter both the rate and reversibility of 
each of these steps.6 However, in recent work we 
have demonstrated that even improved 2PCA 
derivatives undergo significant levels of dissociative 
cleavage in the presence of competitive peptides, 
limiting applications where longterm stability is 
required.7 Moreover, imidazolidinones form with 
relatively slow kinetics, necessitating long reaction 
times and high reagent loadings that may be 
detrimental for some protein targets, with cyclisation 
of a protonated iminium ion the ratedetermining 
step. Scheme 1 Reactions studied in this work, governing modification of protein Ntermini with 2
pyridinecarboxaldehydes (2PCAs) to form imidazolidinone conjugates.
