Among diverse Nheterocycles, phthalazines represent a valua
ble class of compounds and are important subunits of a broad 
variety of natural products with remarkable biological activi
ties13 and are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals.46An impressive 
number of known drugs contain a phthalazine core, e.g., hydral
azine (used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure),7 car
bazeran (potent cardiac stimulant)8 and vatalanib (anticancer 
drug)9, 10 and recently reported drug candidate A196 (potent 
and selective inhibitor of protein lysine methyltransferases 
(PKMTs) (Figure 1a).11 
Besides, phthalazinebased compounds are widely employed as 
catalysts12 or ligands in a variety of transition metal com
plexes.1316 Apart from that, they act as key intermediates in or
ganic synthesis.
