During the discharge of the battery, the oxygen from the air is reduced at the cathode and
combines with a Li ion to form solid Li2O2. During the recharge, the reverse decomposition
of Li2O2 occurs. The overpotential needed to recharge the battery determines its eciency
and depends on several factors that can have dierent origin. The source of the energy
barriers originates in the intrinsic reversible reaction but also is aected by the morphology
of the discharge product2,6 or the presence of sidereaction secondary phases.5,7
A profound knowledge of the electronic and transport properties of Li2O2 both in bulk
and at the surface is crucial to understand the reversible reaction of Eq. 1 and to propose
new routes to circumvent the above mentioned diculties.
