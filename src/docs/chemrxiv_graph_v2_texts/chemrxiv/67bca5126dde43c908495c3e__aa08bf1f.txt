INTRODUCTION 
The thioredoxinthioredoxin reductase (TrxTrxR) and the 
glutaredoxinglutathioneglutathione reductase (GrxGSHGR) 
systems are central to maintaining cellular redox homeodynamics.1 
These relay systems use NADPH to balance many arms of redox 
chemistry via the redoxin (Trxfold) family of proteins2,3 
controlling metabolic processes including nucleic acid synthesis, 
as well as thiol redox proteome switches, and antioxidant defense.4 
Despite their key roles in biology, the Trx and Grx systems have 
long lacked highquality probes that could monitor and decrypt 
their activity in living cells. Conceptually, a suitable turnover probe 
could feature an artificial redox substrate that is selectively reduced 
by a specific vicinal dichalcogenide redoxin (Grxs, Trxs, TrxRs), 
then fragments irreversibly to accumulate a noninvasive readout 
(e.g., release a fluorophore).
