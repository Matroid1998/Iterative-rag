Description:
Forms the core structure of diamond nanoparticles, influencing their optical and magnetic properties.

Text:
Carbonbased nanoparticles have exhibited unique materials properties and multipurpose 
usages in nanoscience 1 and biomedicine 2. In tandem with the characteristics of this important 
class of nanomaterials 3, the remarkable optical and magnetic properties of diamond 
nanoparticles 4 have attracted strong interest in a versatile range of applications 5, including 
hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chemical sensing in fluids 6. Recent 
studies have been targeted at unraveling dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) 7, a process in 
which saturation or pumping of paramagnetic defects in diamond nanocrystals by microwave 
fields or optical illumination can generate nuclear spin polarizations order of magnitude larger than 
thermal equilibrium polarization 8. All these novel applications 9 depend on the spatial 
distribution of paramagnetic centers around the core carbon structure of diamond nanoparticles 
10.
