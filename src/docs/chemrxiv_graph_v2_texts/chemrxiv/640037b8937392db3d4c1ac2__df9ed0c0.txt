TEMPO radical10 (T) or some of its derivatives,11 which have
shown to be relevant in many fields of molecular science such as
controlled radical polymerisation,12 spin labeling,13 and redox
reactions.14 T can accept an OHO hydrogen bond from its asso
ciated hydroxylamine TEMPOH (TH). This complex THT (Fig. 1,
top) undergoes hydrogen atom transfer to the formally equivalent
THT structure through a barrier which is expected to be rather
high15 due to the steric hindrance of T and TH. The sterically hindered hydroxylamine TH is known as an anhy
drous crystalline solid16 and as a crystal containing one water for
every three TH units17.

Description:
Adopts a conformation where hydrogen points to the open side of a sterically hindered substituted nitroxyl unit and prefers to bind to the oxygen of a neighbouring hydroxylamine or water.

Text:
In both cases, there are closed hydrogen
bond networks, involving three TH units for the anhydrous struc
ture and six for the trient or 0.33hydrate. In these structures,
the hydroxylamine adopts a conformation where the hydrogen
points to the open side (o) of the sterically hindered substituted
nitroxyl unit and prefers to bind to the oxygen of a neighbouring
hydroxylamine or water. To close the strained trimeric ring in the
anhydrous crystal, the last TH binds to the N atom (instead of O)
of the first unit. In the 0.33hydrate, the Nbinding is taken over
by water molecules. There is thus a clear numerical preference for
OHO coordination and closed ring structures among TH units
in the solid state.
