Description:
Used to produce 2chloromethyl6methylmorpholine under standard conditions.

of even a methyl substituent25,63 can drastically af
fect lipophilicity, solubility, bioavailability and selectivity of 
bioactive compounds;64 thus, being able to access methylated 
and similarly substituted spiroacetal scaffolds would potentially 
be useful for future hit optimization studies. Moreover, substi
tution would introduce the issue of diastereoselectivity, which 
we also wanted to explore. 2Chloromethyl6methylmorpholine 30 was produced in 
good yield under our standard conditions from (S)1benzyla
minopropan2 ol (31) and racepichlorohydrin (5), and iso
lated as a 21 mixture of diastereoisomers65 as determined by 
1HNMR spectroscopy (Scheme 7). Scheme 5.
