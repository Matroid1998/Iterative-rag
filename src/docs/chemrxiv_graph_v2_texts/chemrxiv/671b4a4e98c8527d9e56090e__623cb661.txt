Description:
Activated nucleotides can be incorporated into a copied strand with minimal catalytic support of metal cations.

fact, it was demonstrated that ribozymes can not only catal
yse templatedirected RNA primer extension but also sup
port the evolution of catalytic RNA assemblies 5,7,8,1115. However, before the formation of complex rybozymes, first
short RNA oligomers could only undergo a more primordial
form of nonenzymatic template copying, which enables the
incorporation of activated nucleotides into the copied strand
with minimal catalytic support of metal cations.
