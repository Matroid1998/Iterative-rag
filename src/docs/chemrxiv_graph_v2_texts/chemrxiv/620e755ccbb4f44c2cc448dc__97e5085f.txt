Description:
A degraded limonoid, part of a subclass of limonoid natural products.

Text:
Degraded limonoids, such as azedaralide (3), pyroangolensolide (4) and (
)melazolide B (5), are a subclass of limonoid natural products arising from 
ringintact or ringrearranged limonoids.16 Although highly speculative at this 
juncture, Guerriero and coworkers hypothesized, based on the coisolation of 
pyroangolensolide (4) and melazolide B (5), that they may derive from an 
uncertain common tetranotriterpenoid precursor such as deoxyandirobin (7) 
(Scheme 2).16 Fragmentation along the C9C10 bond would yield fragments 
resembling degraded limonoid natural products (Scheme 2).16 Mechanistic 
proposals 
have 
previously 
been 
suggested 
but 
have 
not 
been 
substantiated.17,18
