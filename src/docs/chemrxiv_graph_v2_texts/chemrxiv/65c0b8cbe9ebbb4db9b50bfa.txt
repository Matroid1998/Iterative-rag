Description:
Involved in transfer reactions in proteins, important for biological functions and can involve deep proton tunneling.

The primary limitation of the classical approximation is, however, also clear inherently
quantum eects such as delocalization, zeropoint energy, tunnelling, andor interferences,
are completely missed. Even for large systems, there are plenty of situations where quantum dynamical eects
are known to be importantand therein lies the challenge. For example, the study of hydro
gen transfer in proteins is important for understanding the multitude of biological functions
supported by this fundamental reactionwhich in some cases even requires consideration
of deep proton tunneling.1 Similarly, hydrogen tunneling dynamics was experimentally re
vealed in phenolammonia clusters activated by UVphoton absorption.2 Other aromatic
biomolecules (e.g., indole and pyrole3 in the presence of water and ammonia solvents) man
ifest a behavior that attests to quantum nuclear eects governing the dynamics in excited
electronic states.
