Description:
A polar solvent that can deprotonate corroles.

The tautomeric structures of freebase porphyrintype compounds reflect a fascinating interplay 
of hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, steric effects, and solvation.1 Furthermore, the tautomerism is 
critical to applications of the compounds as components of emerging molecularelectronic and 
memorystorage devices.2,3 A great deal of study, accordingly, has been devoted to the study of 
tautomerism in porphyrins,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 Nconfused porphyrins,15,16,17,18

expanded porphyrins,38,39 and corroles.40,41,42,43,44,45 Even when presenting the very first synthesis 
of a corrole, Johnson and Kay noted that it forms a stable anion.46 Subsequently, several 
researchers noted the deprotonation of corroles by mild bases and even simply by polar solvents 
such as DMF,47,48,49,50 while Gross et al.
