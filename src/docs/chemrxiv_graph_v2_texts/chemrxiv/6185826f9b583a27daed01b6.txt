Description:
Monolayers predicted to exhibit coexistence of magnetism and piezoelectricity.

Text:
Piezoelectricity and valleytronics require broken inver
sion symmetry and a band gap. Promisingly there al
ready exists a wide range of noncentrosymmetric and in
trinsically piezoelectric 2D materials 3, 4. On the other
hand, there are only a few 2D semiconductorsinsulators
to date in which both timereversal and inversion sym
metry are broekn. Very recently, the coexistence of mag
netism and piezoelectricity has been predicted in vana
dium dichalcogenide monolayers5. However, how the
magnetic ordering impacts on their piezoelectricity re
mains unexplored. This understanding will allow us to
couple magnetism and piezoelectricity for realizing mul
tifunctional piezoelectric devices.
