Description:
Defects inhibit ion insertion and decrease electronic conductivity.

Highly crystalline materials, 
considered to have a limited number of defects, are reported to favor superior cyclelife and rate capability. The importance of Fe(CN)64 
defects in contributing to structural collapse is stated to be due to their inhibition of ion insertion and decrease in electronic conductivity.25
28 However, understanding the loss of capacity is again complicated by the differing process mechanisms that are suggested for charge 
balancing and K intercalation. Importantly, current understanding of the location of K in PB is deduced from general long range structural information such as diffraction 
data, or via theoretical simulation. Herein, we show that operando potassium Kedge Xray absorption near edge structure (XANES) can
