Description:
A zeolite used as a catalyst in methane dehydroaromatization.

Due to
losses in each step, a direct conversion of methane is more desirable and has been stud
ied extensively 8. Unfortunately, direct conversion of methane to valueadded products is
challenging because of the low chemical reactivity of methane. Direct methane activation
has usually involved a bulk catalyst, owing to the advantages of simply pumping methane
gas onto solids that can handle high temperatures and pressures. Oxidative coupling of
methane has mostly been reported for heterogenous catalysts 8. Methane dehydroarom
atization, where methane is converted nonoxidatively into aromatic compounds, mainly
benzene, has also been performed exclusively heterogeneously, using HZSM5 and HMCM5
zeolites containing molybdenum centers 6 and more recently gallium nitride 9, 10.
