Description:
Subject to novel mediated reductions to avoid metallic residues.

Text:
I) metal catalysts face the issue of metallic 
deuterium atom transfers (mDAT);34 II) an organomediator to 
avoid any metallic residues in reference to the development of 
novel mediated styrene reductions; III) providing a general, 
economical and environmentalfriendly approach in reference to 
their developed method. A solvent screen revealed DMF to be the 
solvent of choice (a few examples of our method were run in DMF), 
however no MeCN was tested which works best for the reductions 
developed by Cheng and Li28 and Werz.33 The authors claim of 
a careful optimization is hence not fitting. It is worth mentioning 
that the scope of both reactions presented in Scheme 2b share 
one example (d)28a in equal yields of 81. The scope presented 
by Qiu et al.

Description:
Undergoes hydrogenation starting with cathodic reduction and subsequent protonation to form a benzylic radical.

Text:
also contains examples which were successfully 
converted without a mediator present. The mechanism of styrene hydrogenation is believed to 
start by cathodic reduction of 27 and subsequent protonation 
delivering a benzylic radical which undergoes the same process 
again to furnish products 28 (Scheme 3c).27,33 The difference in 
Qius concept is that the radical anion of TPPO (29) transfers an 
electron to styrene 27 which then leads to intermediates of the 
direct pathway. The mediator TPPO (29) formed is in situ by 
anodic oxidation of TPP (30), a molecule which unlikely acts as a 
reductive mediator. The authors declare TPP (30) as the mediator 
and only clarify its role in the mechanistic part which concludes 
their manuscript11  we find this misleading especially to readers 
unfamiliar with mediated electrolysis.
