Description:
A common atom onto which a wide variety of nucleophiles can be introduced in organic synthesis.

4)3 and latestage modification of peptides (2 to 3)4

for target identification and proteomics are representative examples in the area of drug discovery and bioorganic chemistry 
32 
(Fig 1B).5 In organic synthesis, Michael acceptors are common substrates to study organocatalysis68 or transition metal 
33 
catalysis911 for many other applications, and significant advances have been made over the past decades to introduce a 
34 
wide variety of nucleophiles onto the carbon atom. Despite these efforts, one of the key limitations of modern synthesis 
35 
methodology still lies within cyclopropenebased Michael acceptors 1c that are intrinsically challenging substrates 
36 
themselves.
