Amines are key intermediates in the 
chemical industry. Due to their nucleophilic 
properties, they impart high reactivity1. Various amines, including primary, secondary, 
and tertiary amines, are widely used to produce 
agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, and 
polymers2. Primary amines, in particular, are 
important raw materials for manufacturing 
drugs, 
pesticides, 
emulsifiers, 
and 
plasticizers3. Currently, the methods for 
synthesizing primary amines include reductive 
amination 
of 
carbonyl 
compounds4, 
hydrogenation 
of 
nitro 
compounds5, 
amination of alcohols6, reduction of nitrile 
compounds7, and Nalkylation of halogenated 
compounds8. Among them, the catalytic 
hydrogenation of nitrile compounds using 
molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent has the 
advantages of high atom economy9 and 
a simple process and is a popular choice for the 
industrial synthesis of amine compounds10. However, nitrile hydrogenation also has 
disadvantages.
