Description:
Functional groups in enzymes that can bind heavy metals, altering catalytic activity.

Text:
We chose selenium oxide 
nanoparticles as the nanomaterial for our biosensor because of their high binding affinity with heavy 
metals such as mercury, which facilitates the detection process16. We also chose protease enzyme as 
the biorecognition element for our biosensor because of its wide availability and low cost. Protease 
enzyme is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins17. Heavy metals can 
affect the structure and function of protease enzyme by binding to its thiol groups or other active sites, 
which results in changes in its catalytic activity and heat production18,19.In pursuit of sustainability and 
costeffectiveness, we innovatively synthesized a crude protease enzyme extracted from chicken 
intestine.
