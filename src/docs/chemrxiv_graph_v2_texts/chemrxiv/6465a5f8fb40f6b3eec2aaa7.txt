Description:
Atoms that can be visualized using MicroED and neutron crystallography, unlike with X-ray crystallography.

Text:
This contrasts with Xray freeelectron laser (XFEL) serial 
crystallography and serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX), which require hundreds of 
thousands of crystals, with the crystals needing to be larger than 1 m and 5 m, 
respectively.4,5 Ultimately, crystallographic techniques that use electrons, Xrays, or neutrons 
are complementary because the beams interacting with the sample have different 
sensitivities for various elements. Moreover, MicroED and neutron crystallography can 
visualize hydrogen atoms, which are often not possible with Xray crystallography due to
