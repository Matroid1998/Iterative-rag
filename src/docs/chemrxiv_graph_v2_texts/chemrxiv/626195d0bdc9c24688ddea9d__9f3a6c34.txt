Description:
Serves as a sustainable catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation.

Text:
3,5Dibromophenyl ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate is reported in catalysis studies of potassium
functionalized graphitic carbon nitride supported on reduced graphene oxide as a sustainable 
catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation 1, and in the synthesis of ethyl 3amino1aryl1H
benzofchromene2carboxylates in aqueous media 2. 2,6Dichlorophenyl 2
methoxyethyl phenylcyanoacrylate was involved in Knoevenagel condensation catalytic 
studies 3,4. 3,5Difluorophenyl ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate is reported in synthesis using 
ionic liquid covalently modified magnesiumaluminum hydrotalcite amphiphilic catalytic 
material 5, and bicyclic pyridine derivatives as fatty acid binding protein inhibitors 6. 4
Chloro3fluorophenyl ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate is involved in asymmetric reaction of p
quinone diimide via organocatalyzed Michael addition of cyanoacetates 7, and in 
preparation of cyclopentadpyrimidine derivatives as Akt protein kinase inhibitors 8.
