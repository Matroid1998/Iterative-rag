Involved in metal-air batteries as a reactant with metals.

Text:
Metalair (or metal oxygen) batteries have been a research topic for many decades with the 
hope of creating high specific energy batteries. However, most of this research is conducted at room 
temperatures, where a number of challenges remain. For aqueous metaloxygen batteries, such as 
the aluminumair primary cell, corrosion reactions between the aqueous electrolyte and negative 
electrode significantly decrease available capacity of the device. While this problem can be 
mitigated by using high purity metals, this significantly increases cost 1. Nonaqueous electrolytes 
have been explored for a number of different metalair battery systems, particularly for the lithium
air system, but the insoluble nature of metal oxide discharge products results in passivation of the 
air electrode 2.

Description:
Ions that serve as charge carriers in a solid oxide fuel cell framework.

Text:
Another approach, the focus of this article, is to use a solid oxide fuel celltype 
framework to allow for oxygen ions as the charge carrier, rather than metal cations, as shown in 
Figure 1. This framework is termed solid oxide metalair battery. In this architecture, oxygen ions 
transport through a solid electrolyte and combine with metal cations which have donated electrons 
to the external circuit. The resulting metal oxide is deposited at the interface between the metal and 
the solid electrolyte. However, as the metal oxide layer grows, there could be transport limitations 
either due to oxygen anion or metal cation transport though the growth front.
