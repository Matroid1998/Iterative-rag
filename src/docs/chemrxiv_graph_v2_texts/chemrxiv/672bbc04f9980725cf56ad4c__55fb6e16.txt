Description:
The source material from which graphene is isolated.

Text:
The successful isolation of graphene from graphite along with the
discovery of its distinctive properties has attracted considerable inter
est in 2Dlayered materials 1. In recent years, remarkable progress
has been made in the exploration of these materials, evolving from fun
damental research to advanced materials engineering and the develop
ment of innovative technologies 25. A special place among 2D
layered materials belongs to semiconducting transitionmetal dichalco
genides (TMDs) containing molybdenum (Mo) such as MoS2, MoSe2,
and MoTe2 with the general formula MoX2, where X refers to a chalco
gen element. MoX2 monolayers possess a direct band gap in contrast
to graphene and offer unique physicochemical characteristics, paving
the way for their application in (opto)electronics, spintronics, electro
catalysis, sensing, and energy storage 415.
