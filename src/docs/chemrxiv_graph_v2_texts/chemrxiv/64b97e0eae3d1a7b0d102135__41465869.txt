Description:
Salts with a common structure of N2ArylR, used as surface modifiers due to their simplicity of functionalization and characterization.

Text:
MoS2, which is similar to graphene in terms of structure, is a layered transition metal 
dichalcogenide (TMD). Compared to some other TMDs, MoS2 is naturally abundant and 
relatively cheap and thus has attracted increasing attention 1. It has been widely 
investigated for applications in electronics, photonics, sensing, energy storage etc. 2. Exfoliated MoS2 can be obtained through mechanical exfoliation, liquid phase exfoliation, 
electrochemical exfoliation, and chemical exfoliation 36. Aryl diazonium salts, which have a common structure of N2ArylR, stand out as surface 
modifiers due to their simplicity of functionalization and characterization. In addition, R 
can be replaced by other type of functional groups according to the desired application. They are therefore widely used to modify the surfaces of materials for sensors, electrodes, 
catalysts and others 7, 8.
