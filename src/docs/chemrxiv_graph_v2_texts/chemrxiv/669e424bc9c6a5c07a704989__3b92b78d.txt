investigated alternative composite materials27. However, in the field of materials development, data bias presents 
difficulties when building prediction models using machine learning. Recently, photocatalytic water splitting has attracted attention as a promising technology for producing lowcost 
green hydrogen2830. The development of visiblelightresponsive photocatalysts is important for the efficient utilization 
of solar light. A number of metalsulfide photocatalysts have been developed for hydrogen evolution from aqueous 
solutions containing sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation3032. In particular, Kudo et al., who is one of the 
authors, have developed many metalsulfide photocatalysts such as ZnSCuInS2AgInS233, AI2ZnAIVS4(AICu, Ag; 
AIVSn, Ge)34, ZnSCuGaS235, Cu3MS4(MV, Nb, Ta)36 being active for sacrificial hydrogen evolution under visible 
light irradiation.
