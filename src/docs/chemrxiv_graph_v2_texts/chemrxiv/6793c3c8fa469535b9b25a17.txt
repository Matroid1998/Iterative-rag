Description:
Simulated at the HF level to study its molecular structure.

Patrick Huang and Emily A. Carter conducted a reviewed 
different techniques including the ubiquitous density functional theory (DFT) and its extensions such as DFT 
 U and hybrid DFT that locally refine the quantum treatment to improve accuracy4. Moreover, research by 
Ziegler in 1991 underscored the superiority of the DFT approach with the HartreeFockSlater (HFS) method 
over ab initio HF method in describing molecular structure, as evidenced by lower mean absolute error5. Hence, DFT approximations can represent a refinement of the methodology employed by Gurka and Titus, 
who simulated nine isomers of Tetrachlorobutadiene (TCBD) at the HF level.
