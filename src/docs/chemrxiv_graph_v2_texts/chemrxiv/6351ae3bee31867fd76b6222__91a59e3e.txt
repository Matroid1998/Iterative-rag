Description:
An aromatic monomer used for polyurethanes (PUR).

Their 
steady depletion and contribution to global warming are driving factors for implementing a more 
sustainable circular economy which includes using biomass for chemicals and fuels production.1 
Especially for household products that frequently contain polymers, there is a strong consumer 
demand for green alternatives due to environmental concerns and awareness.2 Many polymers 
possess aromatic monomers, e.g., pxylene for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), styrene for 
polystyrene (PS), toluene diisocyanate for polyurethanes (PUR), derived from benzene, toluene, 
and xylene (BTX) of which more than 122 Mt are produced annually, also for use in solvent and 
fuel applications.3 As of today, aromatics are obtained by catalytic reforming of naphtha, a crude 
oil fraction.4 Thus, using biomass as raw material feedstock for their production, ideally conceived 
as a dropin solution, opens the door to a large variety of renewably sourced products without 
modifying the existing infrastructure downstream.
