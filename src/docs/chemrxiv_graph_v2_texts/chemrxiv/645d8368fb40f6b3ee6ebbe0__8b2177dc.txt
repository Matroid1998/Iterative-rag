Description:
Traditional gate layer material in transistors with thickness limitations due to leakage currents.

Text:
Materials with high permittivities are important research and development targets, as
gate components in metaloxide semiconductor transistors 1, 2 and high energy density
capacitors.3, 4 Industry demands everincreasing performance in these devices, with
capacitance increased most often by decreasing dielectric layer thicknesses. However, the
thicknesses of traditional SiO2 gate layers can not be decreased below 1 nm,2 because
increasing leakage currents negate capacitance improvements. Using thicker dielectrics with
larger permittivities allows device footprints to continue to shrink while maintaining low
leakage currents. One way to increase the permittivity of a dielectric is to add highly polarizable
inclusions.3, 5 As with other composites, the properties of the mixed material are potentially
tunable.
