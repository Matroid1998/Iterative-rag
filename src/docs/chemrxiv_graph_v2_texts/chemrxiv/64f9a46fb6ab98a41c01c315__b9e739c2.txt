Description:
A component of heme peroxidases involved in catalyzing oxidation reactions and reducing peroxide concentration.

Text:
Heme peroxidases are ubiquitous in nature.1 They exhibit a variety 
of functions ranging from catalyzing oxidation reactions to defending against pathogens, 
synthesis of prostanoids, and reducing peroxide concentration.24 Horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP, Scheme 1a) is highly valued by chemical industry for its ability to oxidize organic 
molecules using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant.5 It is also being explored as a potential 
solution for decontaminating wastewater.6,7 The remarkable activity of peroxidases is 
attributed to the generation of compound I and compound II, versatile highvalent oxidants 
that result from the reaction of peroxides at a histidinebound ferric heme site, Scheme 1b.8
12 Scientists have invested significant efforts to develop functional mimics of these enzymes, 
such as FeTAML, Feporphyrin derivatives, and hemepeptide complexes, as well as 
utilizing various other biological constructs.1230 Despite notable peroxidase activity exhibited 
by certain artificial catalysts, most of them frequently reveal slower reaction rates and lower 
overall 
efficiency 
compared 
to 
their 
native 
counterparts.
