Description:
Dissolved in samples for hydrogenation experiments using ZULF NMR.

Text:
In 
ZULF NMR experiments, enhanced signals can be 
observed if there is a heteronuclear spin present in the 
molecule which renders the parahydrogenderived protons 
magnetically inequivalent 31. In this work we study twostep hydrogenation of an 
unsaturated 
precursor 
molecule 
with 
paraenriched 
hydrogen gas using ZULF NMR. This is done by 
continuously bubbling the hydrogen gas into samples 
containing dissolved dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate
