Description:
A base metal catalyst used in alkene isomerization.

Text:
Over the last years base metal catalysts based on nickel,11 cobalt,12 and iron,13 have emerged in the field 
of alkene isomerization.7,14 Selected base metal catalysts for the isomerization of alkenes are depicted in 
Figure 1.
