A group that can be protonated to promote carbocation formation.

Text:
Type I TSs catalyze carbocation generation by removing the 
72 
pyrophosphate group, whereas Type II TSs promote carbocation formation through 
73 
protonating the olefin or epoxy group present in the substrate. Once the carbocation is
