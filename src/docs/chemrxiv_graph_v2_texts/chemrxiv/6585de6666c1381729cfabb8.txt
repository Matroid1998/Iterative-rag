Description:
A chemical energy carrier used in carbon-neutral energy systems and electrosynthesis.

A broad implementation of a sustainable energy system requires the development of a wellaligned
19
mix of technologies that allow for the carbonneutral conversion, storage, and transport of energy,
20
where chemical energy carriers such as green hydrogen are likely to play a key role across dif
21
ferent energy sectors1. Active and durable catalysts are required for the electrosynthesis of green
22
hydrogen using excess renewable energy, and for the conversion of hydrogen into electricity using
23
electrolyzers and fuel cells. The application of nanostructured catalysts allows to considerably in
24
crease the efficiency of such devices24.
