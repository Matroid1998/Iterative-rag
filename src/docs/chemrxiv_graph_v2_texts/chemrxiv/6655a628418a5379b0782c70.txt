Description:
Reactive rings that terminate the prepolymer chains of epoxy resins.

Text:
Epoxy resins are widely used across a range of industries due to their chemical 
resistance, mechanical strength, and processing ease. Their prepolymer chains consist 
of a backbone with cyclic ring structures, terminated with reactive epoxide rings 41. These are crosslinked by nucleophilic attack from amino groups in the hardener, forming
