Description:
A fundamental example of molecular photoswitches used in developing novel functional materials controlled by light.

Text:
Molecular photoswitches, of which azobenzene is a fundamental example,13 hold promise
for developing novel functional materials controlled by light.46 In complex systems, how
ever, numerous photoswitchable units may be present together in a relatively small space
volume, and resulting intermolecular interactions between chromophores may affect their
photophysics and photochemistry. Examples are azobenzenefunctionalized selfassembled
monolayers (SAMs),710 micelles,1113 surfactantpolymer aggregates,1416 and crystalline
