Description:
An environmentally clean and powerful oxidant used in sterilization, deodorization, decolorization, and water treatment.

Text:
Dissolved ozone in water is an environmentally clean and powerful oxidant, with an 
absence of harmful residues, which has found use in sterilizationsanitization,1 deodorization,2 
decolorization,3 and the treatment of potable waterwastewater.4,5 As ozone decays in water 
with a halflife of ca. 20 minutes,4 production onsite is a necessity.

Description:
Produced in air or oxygen via corona discharge under very high voltages.

Text:
Traditionally, ozone is 
produced in air (or oxygen) via corona discharge, under very high voltages.6 This process is 
energy intensive, requires a high initial cost, and produces large amounts of heat and also 
harmful nitrogen oxides (in air).79 In contrast, electrochemical ozone production (EOP) has 
gained much attention as dissolved ozone can be produced simply by oxidizing water at a 
suitable anode, with the advantages of a smallscale and robust experimental setup, low 
voltage operation, high current efficiency and no gas feedstocks.10 
Efficient EOP requires an anode that electrocatalytically favors EOP over the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER).

Description:
Generated using perforated freestanding BDD electrodes.

Text:
Thin film BDD1117 has been used for 
EOP with either water,13,14,17 sulfuric acid,11,12 or perchloric acid12 as the electrolyte. In water, 
a Nafion separating membrane is essential, functioning as both a solid electrolyte and as a 
proton transporter. Perforated freestanding BDD electrodes have also been used in ozone 
generation,15,16 designed with an aim to maximize contact between BDD, solution and the
