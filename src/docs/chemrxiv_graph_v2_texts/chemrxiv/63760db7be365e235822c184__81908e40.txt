Description:
Reagents used in tandem annulation reactions to synthesize sultones.

Text:
As the sulfur analogous of lactones, sultones are an important class of 
sulfur heterocycles that used widely in the synthesis of natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, biologically active molecules and advanced functional 

materials1. Due to the remarkable synthesis importance, considerable 
efforts have been exerted to develop efficient methods for the synthesis of 
these valuable building blocks. Over the past decade, transitionmetal 
catalyzed CH insertion reactions2, cycloaddition reactions3, radical 
reactions4 and metathesis reactions5 have been developed for the 
construction of sultones. Recently, Lupton6 and Qin7 developed a tandem 
annulation reaction of easily tautomerizable ketones (or their TMS enol 
ethers) and ethenesulfonyl fluorides, which provide a novel protocol for 
the synthesis of sultones.
