Description:
Ion ligated by nitrogen donor atoms in the active site of LPMOs.

Text:
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) form a copperdependent family of enzymes
classied under the auxiliary activity (AA) superfamily, spanning members AA9AA17 (with
AA12 exempted).19 The LPMOs are known for their ability to boost polysaccharide degra
dation by oxidizing the glycosidic bonds that link the monosaccharide subunits.1016 This
oxidation is unique among polysaccharidedegrading enzymes and has the potential to sig
nicantly contribute to the eciency of sustainable biofuel production from lignocellulosic
sources.1,2,17,18 Additionally, their biotechnological potential continues to expand, with recent
identications of LPMOs as virulence factors in agricultural pests19 and disease vectors.20,21
The catalytic activity of LPMOs is ascribed to a strictly conserved, solventexposed active
site in which three nitrogen donor atoms ligate a copper ion, forming a histidine brace.3 This
brace comprises one histidine ligand, coordinating with the imidazole N!2 atom, and the
terminal histidine residue that coordinates bidentately with the imidazole N1 as well as the
backbone NH2 group (see Fig.
