Description:
A biodegradable and biocompatible polymer used in tissue engineering and drug delivery systems.

Text:
Because of its 
degradability and biocompatibility, PLGA has attracted significant attention for applications such as 
tissue engineering and drug delivery systems.2,7,9 
The intended purpose determines the desired properties of PLGA, and these can, in turn, be related 
to the chemical structure.10 For instance, previous research has shown that the molecular weight, 
chemical composition, and end group of the polymer will affect the size of PLGA nanoparticles, the 
amount of drug that can be loaded into these, and the rate at which they biodegrade.9,1113 
Therefore, knowledge of the molecularweight distribution (MWD), chemicalcomposition 
distribution (CCD), and functionalitytype (endgroup) distribution (FTD) is crucial for creating 
tailored highperformance polyesters.
