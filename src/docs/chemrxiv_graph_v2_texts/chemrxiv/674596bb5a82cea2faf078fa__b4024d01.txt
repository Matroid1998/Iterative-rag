Description:
Stabilized in the low-temperature ordered phase by hydrogen bonds.

Text:
Hydrogen bonding is an important tool in crystal engineering enabling control of
inter or intramolecular interactions and plays a critical role in the physical prop
erties of many technologically important material systems such as the stability and
optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites 9, 10. In the context of barocalorics,
hydrogen bonding has previously been found to play a central role in the order
disorder structural phase transitions observed in molecular plastic crystals. 11. For
instance, in a combined computational and spectroscopic study conducted by Li et al. on neopentyl glycol, it was demonstrated that hydrogen bonds provide stability to
the lowtemperature (LT) ordered phase 11.
