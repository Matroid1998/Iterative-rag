Description:
A fraction of crude oil used as a starting material for the synthesis of aromatic compounds.

Currently, fossil carbon 
sources (oil, coal and natural gas) are still the predominant 
starting materials for the synthesis of aromatic compounds, 
mainly produced from the naphtha fraction of crude oil (Figure 
1a).1 However, it is well known that high consumption of fossil 
resources associated with growing environmental concerns 
requires the identification of sustainable alternatives for 
obtaining fuels, chemicals and functional materials.2,3 In this 
context, biomass presents itself as a promising and sustainable 
source of organic carbon, with great potential for substitution 
and supplementation of fossil resources accordingly to the 
fundamental principles of Green Chemistry.4 Among the 
available biomasses, chitin is the second most abundant 
biopolymer in nature and the main constituent of the 
exoskeleton of arthropods.
