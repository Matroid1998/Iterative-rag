Description:
A compound used in enantioselective acylative DKR catalysis.

Text:
To the best of our knowledge only a single report from 
Ye and coworkers utilising NHC catalysed enantioselective 
acylative DKR of benzosultam derived trifluoromethyl substituted 
hemiaminols has been reported in this area to date.4 Although 
excellent enantioselectivity was observed, this methodology was 
limited by the need for C(3)perfluorinated substituents at the 
carbinol centre, and requires a stoichiometric oxidant (3,3,5,5
tetratertbutyldiphenoquinone, DQ) for reactivity (Fig 1D).
