Description:
Can form dendritic structures that contribute to battery safety issues such as thermal runaway and combustion.

However, these very lithiumion batteries are highly toxic and corrosive to our en
vironment. The primary concern with LIBs is the large possibility of combustion or explosion, which is a 
large hazard for those operating and using LIBs. These safety issues are mainly caused by the failure of 
individual components (cathode, anode, electrolytes, or current collector) and the whole system of the 
battery in some abuse conditions, including overcharge, thermal runaway, dendritic lithium growth, cur
rentcollector dissolution, and gas evolution.3 These LIBs are also not rechargeable and must be disposed 
of after use. When not disposed of properly, which is the case 57 of the time, the LIBs chemicals can 
leach into surrounding environments and contaminate the entire habitat, acting as a pollutant.

Description:
A chemical element used in lithium-ion batteries, with mining impacting water resources and wildlife.

Unfortu
nately, this isnt the only negative environmental impact LIBs can have. Mines of around 1 ton of lithium 
can cost around 500 gallons of water, depleting sources from our environment and disrupting nearby 
wildlife.4
