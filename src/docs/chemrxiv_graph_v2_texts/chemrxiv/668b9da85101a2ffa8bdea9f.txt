Electrocatalysis stands as the cornerstone discipline to deliver breakthroughs in electrochemical 
energy conversion technologies, including fuel cells as well as carbon dioxide reduction, nitrate 
reduction and water splitting electrolysers.5 Nevertheless, crucial electrocatalytic reactions 
grapple with sluggish kinetics and inadequate selectivity. A fundamental understanding of 
reaction mechanisms and factors that limit activity and selectivity towards targeted products is 
imperative in order to prompt progress in electrocatalyst design and development.5 However, 
these endeavors are complicated and hindered by the intricate multistep mechanisms and 
concurrent interrelated factors arising on multiple scales. Figure 1 depicts four essential 
components of a comprehensive understanding of electrocatalytic reactions 
 Multistep thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of an elementary step are determined 
by binding energies of adsorbed intermediates involved in this step.
