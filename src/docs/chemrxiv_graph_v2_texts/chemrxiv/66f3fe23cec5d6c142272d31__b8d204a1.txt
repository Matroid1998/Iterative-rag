Graphene, a twodimensional material with a honeycomb lattice of sp2bonded
33
carbon atoms, has garnered significant scientific and industrial attentions due to its
34
exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties.14 Heteroatom doping can
35
further regulate the electronic states and properties of graphene,5,6 thereby facilitating
36
its applications in various fields. Currently, the annual global production of graphene
37
surpasses 23,000 metric tons.

Text:
Industries are planning to add graphene in products such
38
as tires, concrete, and asphalt to enhance their properties, which are currently hot
39
areas of commercial investment in graphene.7 Costeffective mass production is
40
crucial for achieving the largescale industrial application of graphene.8 However,
41
traditional graphene production methods, such as chemical vapor deposition,9
42
reduction of graphene oxide,10 and graphite exfoliation,1113 are complex and
43
timeconsuming, resulting in high costs.

Since 2020, the flash Joule heating (FJH) method has regarded as an effective
45
approach to convert solid carbon into turbostratic flash graphene in seconds under the
46
combined action of high temperature and electric field.1417 In the FJH process, the
47
capacitor tank can discharge instantaneously at approximately 400 V and 1000 A,
48
delivering 400 kW of power to heat a 1.0gram solid carbon sample to over 3000 C
49
in milliseconds.14 By 2023, a smallbatch automatic FJH system capable of loading
50
5.7 grams of metallurgical coke per batch had been designed, with a production
51
capacity of 1.1 kg of graphene in 1.5 hour.18 Scaling up this automatic FJH system to
52
produce larger batches of graphene requires additional capacitors.
