Description:
Selectively dissolved in phenol, 3methylphenol, formic acid, ethane 1,2diol, dimethyl sulfoxide, tributylethylphosphonium diethylphosphate, and CaCl2EtOHH2O mixtures.

Text:
Polyamide 6 has been selectively dissolved
in phenol and 3methylphenol17, formic acid1820, ethane
1,2diol21, dimethyl sulfoxide22, tributylethylphosphonium di
ethylphosphate (P4442Et2PO4)23 and CaCl2EtOHH2O mix
tures (CEW)24. Applied antisolvents to precipitate the polymer
chains have been toluene17,18, xylene17, methanol18, dimethyl
formamide18, hexane18, butan2one18,19,22, dimethyl sulfox
ide18, and water2427. The selective dissolution of PA 6 in CEW has the advantage
that it does not alter the polymers molecular weight distribution,
uses low temperatures (75 C) and nontoxic chemicals that are
readily available (H2O), can be biobased (EtOH) or come as low
