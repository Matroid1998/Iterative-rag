Description:
A moiety used in COFs that contributes to photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

In this context, welldefined crystalline covalent organic frameworks10 (COFs) composed of organic building 
units linked by covalent bonds can act as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution with tunable 
photophysical and optoelectronic properties.1115 COFs can show light harvesting properties with broad absorption 
and effective electron transfer to the catalyst surface with enhanced charge mobility.16,17 
 2DCOFs contain planar layered framework which can be chemically tuned with diverse functionalities based 
on varied synthetic modulation.18 Different molecular design strategies involving donoracceptor moieties, 
photosensitizing entities and pconjugated extended backbone in the building blocks have been explored to 
synthesize photocatalytic COFs.1,13,1923 Beside these, the interplay of several factors including band gaps, charge 
carrier generation, transportation and separation, stability, surface area and morphology also affect the 
photocatalytic performance.24 
 Different COFs based on numerous moieties such as hydrazone, sulfone, azine, thiophene, cyano, imine, and 
diacetylene have been reported and showed growing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates over the recent 
years.2330 However, as COFs are built from reversible linkages there are concerns about their longterm stability 
under photocatalytic conditions.31 Thus, an innovative design approach that can offer functionality, high stability 
as well as potential for practical applicability is needed.
