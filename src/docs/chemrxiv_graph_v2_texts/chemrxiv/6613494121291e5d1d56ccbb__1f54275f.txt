Description:
A compound involved in retrosynthetic analysis.

Text:
The retrosynthetic analysis for eutyscoparol (4) and violaceoid C 
(3) is presented in Figure 2. Both compounds were predicted to 
be synthesized from violaceoid A (1), which, in turn, could be 
derived from aldehyde 5. This aldehyde, serving as a common 
intermediate, would be synthesized from the commercially 
available and symmetric dinitrile 6, following an improved version 
of our previouslyestablished method. Scheme 1. Preparation of aldehyde 5 from symmetric dinitrile 6. Reagents and Conditions a) conc. H2SO4 (7.0 equiv. ), H2O (1.0 
equiv. ), MeOH (0.25 M), reflux, 11 days, 52; b) TBDPSCl (3.0
