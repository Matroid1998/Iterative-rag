Description:
A catalyst conjugating a prodrug disulfide form of a thiol-tethered 4dimethylaminopyridine catalyst moiety.

In contrast, Lysacylating chemical catalysts do 
not require genetic manipulation, and thus have unique utilities 
in epigenetic studies as well as therapeutic purposes.1314 
We previously developed a PEGLANADSSMe catalyst, 
conjugating a prodrug disulfide form (DSSMe) of a thiolteth
ered 4dimethylaminopyridine (DSH) catalyst moiety10 with the 
Nterminus of a histonebinding LANA515 (latency associated 
nuclear antigen, residue 515) peptide15 and a poly(ethylene 
glycol) (PEG) moiety (Figure S1).12 DSSMe generated DSH 
under reducing conditions in cells or in the presence of tris(2
carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in test tubes.
