Description:
Part of the lithium-air battery system where nonaqueous electrolytes are explored.

Metalair (or metal oxygen) batteries have been a research topic for many decades with the 
hope of creating high specific energy batteries. However, most of this research is conducted at room 
temperatures, where a number of challenges remain. For aqueous metaloxygen batteries, such as 
the aluminumair primary cell, corrosion reactions between the aqueous electrolyte and negative 
electrode significantly decrease available capacity of the device. While this problem can be 
mitigated by using high purity metals, this significantly increases cost 1. Nonaqueous electrolytes 
have been explored for a number of different metalair battery systems, particularly for the lithium
air system, but the insoluble nature of metal oxide discharge products results in passivation of the 
air electrode 2.
