Description:
Used as a catalytically active material in mechanochemical reactions.

Text:
Mechanochemistry has emerged as a leading area of 
research for scientists seeking sustainable chemistry 
practices in recent decades.1,2 Its solventfree nature 
makes it particularly attractive for waste avoidance, a core 
aspect of green chemistry. Mechanochemical reactions 
are mostly conducted in ball mills, where moving milling 
balls introduce mechanical energy and facilitate mixing in 
the reaction system.2,3,4 In direct mechanocatalysis, the 
milling media itself is made of catalytically active materials 
like palladium or nickel.4,5,69 This novel kind of catalyst 
introduction facilitates the handling, separation, and 
recycling of the catalyst, further expanding the concept of 
waste prevention in mechanochemistry.
