Description:
Used in noncovalent incorporation to solve phase problems in protein crystallization.

Text:
In particular, 
the research for new additives that can solved either the 
crystallization or the phase determination problems or better 
both simultaneously is a real promising way for improvement 
in the field for a moderate cost. Indeed, it is well known that incorporation in a protein crystal 
of wellordered heavy atom enable to solve the phase problem 
using 
anomalousbased 
methods 

Singlewavelength 
Anomalous 
Dispersion 
(SAD) 
and 
Multiwavelengths 
Anomalous Dispersion (MAD).6 These heavy atoms can be 
implemented in a covalent way pioneered by the Doublis S
toSe replacement using selenomethionine or in a noncovalent 
one using transition metal salts (Hg, Pt) or lanthanide
