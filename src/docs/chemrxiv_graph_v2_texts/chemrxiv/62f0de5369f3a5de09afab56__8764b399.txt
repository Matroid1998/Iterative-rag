Description:
A compound whose emission decreases in acetonitrile solution when complexed with poly1.

Text:
When 
poly1 was dispersed in an acetonitrile solution of OTA, the emis
sion from OTA decreased to a level close to zero within 2 h (Fig. S3) following an intraparticle diffusion model (vide infra). Fig 
3b shows a sharp slope at extremely low concentrations ( 5 nM) 
of OTA for the poly1OTA pair. In contrast, when a polymer 
without functionalization of 1 was used instead of poly1, almost 
no change was observed in the emission spectra. This accounts 
for spontaneous complexation between poly1 and OTA at the in
terfaces being thermodynamically favorable. The adsorption iso
therms of poly1 at 273 K showed biLangmuir behavior in ace
tonitrile (Figs.
