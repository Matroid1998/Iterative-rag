Text:
Choline chloride (ChCl) based deep eutectic solvents (DES) have become a designer solvent owing to their 
appealing properties and benign nature.110 The microscopic arrangement and properties of DES can be 
tailored by changing the molecular ratio of the constituent molecules. Low cost, easy handling, and low 
toxicity have enabled DES to emerge as a promising solvent media in the field of separation, synthesis, 
catalysis, and electrochemical process.1114 Its remarkable physical properties and biocompatibility have 
caught the attention of various research groups leading to its widespread applications in diverse research 
fields, including the preservation of enzymeprotein activity.15,16 Most commonly used hydrogen bond 
donors like urea, ethylene glycol, malonic acid, etc.
