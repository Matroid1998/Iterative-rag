Description:
Believed to be involved in consecutive internal shift reactions that facilitate autoxidation reactions.

Estimates suggest
that between 10,000 and 100,000 different organic compounds are found in the atmosphere,
and each VOC can undergo a number of different degradation pathways yielding different
oxidation products, which greatly complicates their inclusion in any modeling attempts.9,12
Recently, it has been established that extremelylow volatility organic compounds (ELVOCs),
believed to be formed through consecutive internal hydrogen shift reactions that facilitate
autoxidation reactions, play a critical role in organic enhanced nucleation.1315
The majority of studies on the impact of VOCs in the atmosphere are focused on ter
penes, in particular pinene, which is emitted from pine forests.9,12 A particular ozonolysis
product of pinene, pinic acid, has become a prototypical NPFrelevant organic acid.16,17
