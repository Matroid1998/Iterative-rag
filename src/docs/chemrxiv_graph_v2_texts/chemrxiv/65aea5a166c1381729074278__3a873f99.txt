Description:
A compound potentially present as nano or microparticles in whale tissues.

Text:
Analysis of the same pilot whale samples by xray absorption near 
35 
edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy4 found that HgSe was present in whale tissues of older individuals while 
36 
in juvenile whales there was no evidence for HgSe. It is still unclear how these particles are formed, which cells 
37 
are responsible and to what extent these nano or microparticles are composed of tiemannite. Further
