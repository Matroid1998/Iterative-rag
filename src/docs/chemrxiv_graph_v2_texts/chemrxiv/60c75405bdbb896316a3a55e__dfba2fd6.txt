The 
development of new methods that to with green chemistry protocols therefore continues to be 
an important area of research. The purpose of this paper is to describe the novel method for 
synthesis of bromo substituted 7Amino phthalides and 7Amino hydroxyphthalide in an 
environment ecofriendly manner with conserve the half mole equivalent of halides. Present Work Methyl 2Nmethyl 2Ntosyl6nitroanthranilate on treatment with 
concentrated sulfuric acid (3 mL) heated at 100oC for 30 minutes gives free amine by 
desulfonation are well documented26. In another reported methods27, 4nitrophthalide is 
formed from methyl2bromomethyl4nitrobenzoate by using concentrated sulfuric acid (at 
100oC) under distillation conditions.
