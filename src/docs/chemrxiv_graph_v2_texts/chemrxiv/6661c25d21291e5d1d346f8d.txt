Description:
Orthofused superstructures with an intrinsic folded spiral superposition of PAHs.

Text:
For instance, the CC and CN 
coupling almost uses PdNicatalytic intermolecular or 
intramolecular annulation to promote the delocalization.8
12 The delocalization of electrons could possess diverse 
interaction processes via throughbond transfer (TBC) or 
throughspace transfer (TSC) to create the topology 
dependence of the optoelectronic properties,1315 such as 
conjugated 
macrocycles,1619 
nanographenes,2024 
organic cages,24,25 heteroatom doped PAHs,27,28 and 
helicenes.2834 
Helicenes, the orthofused superstructures, have an 
intrinsic folded spiral superposition of PAHs.36,37 The 
topology tailoring in helicenes endows an accessional 
possibility of stable radical incubation,34,35,38 circularly 
polarized luminescence (CPL),14,39,40 and chirality
induced spin selectivity (CISS).41,42 The traditional 
carbonnhelicenes with high diradical character and 
dynamic luminescence switchability is hardly accessible 
due to resonance delocalization and monotonous electron 
transfer inherency (e.g.

Description:
Electron-deficient compounds developed from main group phosphine substrates.

Text:
Based on this proof of concept, we develop a new type 
of electrondeficient helicenes from the maingroup 
phosphine substrates by virtue of optimized Mn(III)
