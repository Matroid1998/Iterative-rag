Pyrene (see Figure 1) is a prototypical chromophore with nonKasha emission from a higher state.8
12 Consider, for instance, the results for lowpressure pyrene vapor reported by Baba et al.9 After a low
energy excitation into the S2 state (3.86 eV; see Figure 1), pyrene fluorescence has a single band at 3.26 
eV (380 nm), assigned to S1 emission. However, if a higher excited state is promoted with absorption at 
5.32 eV, a shoulder at 3.65 eV (340 nm) appears in the emission spectrum. This new feature is commonly 
assigned to a nonKasha S2 emission. Similar features and assignments were also reported for pyrene in a 
supersonic jet10 and lowpressure vapor.8, 12
