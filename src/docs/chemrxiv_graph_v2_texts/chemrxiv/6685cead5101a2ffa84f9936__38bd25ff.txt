Description:
Heteroaromatic units prevalent in FDA approved drugs.

Text:
From the standpoint of modern medicine, pyridines (and their benzannulated analogs) are perhaps 
the most important heteroaromatic unit due to their prevalence in FDA approved drugs.11 
Generally, these flat twodimensional structures are diversified through sequential 
functionalization (halogenation, borylation, etc.)

Description:
Undergo routine functionalizations such as electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Text:
Disconnections are often nonintuitive and derived on a casebycase basis, with a 
heavy reliance on carbonyl and olefin chemistry (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, enzymatic CH 
oxidation facilitated by directed evolution techniques is now recognized as one of the most 
powerful methods to scalably and sitespecifically install a functional group onto unactivated Csp3
H bonds.1719 In some sense this is analogous to triedandtrue functionalizations that are routine 
on pyridines, such as electrophilic aromatic substitution. Radical crosscoupling has also recently 
emerged as a versatile platform to couple common Csp3 bearing functional groups such as acids20 
and alcohols21 in the same vein that Suzuki and related couplings are employed on pyridines.
