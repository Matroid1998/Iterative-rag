Description:
The least soluble calcium phosphate in aqueous solution at near-neutral pH.

Text:
The equilibrium constant for a precipitation reaction is the solubility product (Ksp). In the expression of Ksp, 
the activity of the pure solid is considered as 1. Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and hydroxyapatite 
(HAP) nanoparticles frequently appear in precipitation reactions. Is each of the two kinds of precipitates a 
pure solid? HAP is the least soluble calcium phosphate in the aqueous solution at a nearneutral pH. Eqn (1) and (2) 
show its formation and the relevant Ksp expression, respectively; where the formula Ca10(OH)2(PO4)6 
represents the chemical composition of one crystallographic cell. The number of unit cells (u) must be 
sufficiently large for the material to be solid. To indicate the multiple units of the crystalline particle, we 
rewrite eqn (1) as eqn (3).

Description:
The solubility of its crystals is affected by size.

Text:
Taking this into account, a HAP 
nanoparticle is a mixture of the surface phase and the bulk phase, rather than a pure solid. The effect of size 
on the solubility of calcium phosphate crystals has been analyzed.14 As Best noted in 1959 Under such 
circumstances the solubility product will not be defined, a conclusion in agreement with the discrepant 
results of the various attempts to measure such a quantity experimentally.9
