Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous media.

Organic ECH reactions for a series of functional groups have been reported, including CO, CC, 
CC and CN (Fig 1A). (1528) However, these systems typically rely on precious metal catalysts, 
such as Pt and Pd. (22, 29, 30) Moreover, in aqueous media, these cathode materials face the 
competition with the more facile hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which usually requires less 
negative potentials, compromising the Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards the target ECH products. One strategy to minimize the competing HER is to work in alkaline media, wherein the 
concentration of protons is much lower.
