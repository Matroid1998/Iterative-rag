Description:
Forms spinel oxides or oxyhydroxides that are active phases for oxygen evolution in acid solution.

Antharaj and Noda 1 recently published a review entitled Electrochemical dealloyingassisted 
activity enhancement The next big thing in water electrosplitting!. They describe electrochemical 
dealloying and leaching, particularly of intermetallics of Fe, Co or Ni, as a very promising strategy for 
decreasing overpotentials for water splitting, by increase of the surface area in the finely porous 
structure that may be developed by dealloying 2. Antharaj and Noda note that the active phase for 
oxygen evolution in acid solution in these structures is likely the spinel oxides or oxyhydroxides of 
Co, Ni or Fe, and that the major effect is indeed the increase of electroactive surface area resulting
