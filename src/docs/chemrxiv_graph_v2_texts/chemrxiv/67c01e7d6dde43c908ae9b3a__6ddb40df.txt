Description:
A product of catalytic borylation with considerable synthetic utility.

Text:
The catalytic borylation of arenes is well established as an extremely useful CH functionalization 
methodology.13 However, catalytic intermolecular CH borylation processes are almost 
exclusively limited to forming arylboronate esters (ArylB(OR)2), particularly pinacol derivatives 
(ArBPin, Fig. 1A).13 This is due to the commercially available and benchstable precursors 
HBPin  B2Pin2 reacting appropriately with transition metal complexes to enable catalysis to form 
ArBPin products that have considerable synthetic utility. In contrast, catalytic intermolecular 
borylation to access other aryl boranes (i.e., non ArB(OR)2) is extremely rare despite the fact that 
many of these boranes display distinct reactivity profiles compared to the organoboronate ester 
analogues.
