Description:
Exhibit non-piezoelectric behavior due to the existence of an inversion center of symmetry, but piezoelectric behavior can be induced via ordered double-transition metal or chemical doping.

For instance, pristine MXenes, Mn1Xn, exhibit a non
piezoelectric behavior due to the existence of an inversion
center of symmetry, however, such piezoelectric behav
ior can be readily induced via ordered doubletransition
metal andor chemical doping.10
Piezoelectricity is the ability of noncentrosymmetric
materials to transform a mechanical field into an elec
tric field, or vice versa.11 This property becomes ex
tremely useful in the persistent quest for the fabrica
tion of nanoscale devices and nanoelectromechanical
systems (NEMS). Indeed, piezoelectric nanomaterials
(PNMs) have been employed for the design of many novel
nanodevices, such as nanogenerators, nanosensors, nan
odiods, and nanotransistors, among others.1219 Many
2D materials provide a piezoelectric response, however,
most of them solely show an inplane piezoelectric ef
fect, with a very small portion that possesses outofplane
piezoelectricity.
