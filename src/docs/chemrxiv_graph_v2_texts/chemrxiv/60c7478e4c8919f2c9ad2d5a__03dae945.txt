Description:
Another name for homogentisic acid, involved in the tyrosine-phenylalanine catabolic pathway.

Text:
Alkaptonuria is one of the earliest known diseases resulting from an inborn error of
metabolism as described by Archibald Garrod in 1909. It is caused by biallelic mutations in
the HGD gene1 , which encodes for a key metabolic enzyme, homogentisate 1,2
dioxygenase, responsible for the breakdown of homogentisic acid (2,5
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; HGA, chemical structure in Supplementary Fig. S1). In the
tyrosinephenylalanine catabolic pathway2, HGA is released from the liver and circulates at
high levels in AKU patients. HGA is hypothesized to oxidize to BQA (Supplementary Fig. S1)
and eventually accumulate as a dark brown pigmentation in joint cartilage, heart valves, and
spinal discs3,4, in a process called ochronosis.
