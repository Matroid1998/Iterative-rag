Description:
A solvent in which LiCl primarily exists as dimeric species.

Text:
Lithium NMR spectroscopy experiments suggest that
LiCl in tetrahydrofuran (THF) primarily exists as dimeric species,
which can be deaggregated to monomeric entities by excess hex
amethylphosphoramide.52 In contrast, LiBr would predominantly
exist as a monomer,52 while LiI would form a contact ion pair,
as well as a mixture of monomers and dimers.52 Another NMR
study, also conducted in THF, proposed that LiX were to exist as
ionseparated species regardless of the nature of the halide (X 
Cl, Br, I).53 Finally, LiBr was reported to be a cubic tetramer in
toluene.54 These studies were often conducted under low con
centration and temperature conditions to minimize signal broad
ening due to dynamic exchange.52 Therefore, even from solu
tion studies, the available information is often contradictory and
does not reflect the conditions that these species experience un
der operando conditions.
