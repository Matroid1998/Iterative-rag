Transition metal carbonyls have played a significant role in the photochemistry of organometal
lic complexes.1,2 The ultraviolet (UV) excitation of these metal complexes can result in the
loss of one or more carbonyls that create transient intermediates capable of interacting and
reacting with the available solvent. The initial photoproduct dynamics of transition metal
complexes may involve changes of multiplicity giving subpicosecond intersystem crossings
that occur well before vibrational cooling of the reactive metal complex.3 Studies of metal
carbonyls have provided rich insight into solvent coordination, reactivity of intermediates,
the energies of transition states, and spinorbit coupled interactions which are important
properties determining catalytic processes.
