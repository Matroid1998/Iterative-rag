Description:
Undergo photopolymerization using either laser or UV light in stereolithography processes.

Text:
For achieving such a lateral resolution (XY), soft lithography must 
be used.13 This means spin coating a photopolymer, fabricating a mask with high resolution, 
mask alignment and UV developing, baking, and washing steps to make a PDMS mold. Unfortunately, this fabrication method is too complex and restricted to laboratories with 
specialized knowhow and fabrication capabilities. To overcome this problem, PDMS microfluidic molds can be fabricated by stereolithography 
(SLA) or masked stereolithography ((m)SLA) printers, more colloquially called resin 
printers.14,15 
These 
printers 
use 
the 
same 
concept 
of 
stereolithography 
Photopolymerization of (met)acrylates using either laser (SLA) or UV light and an LCD screen 
that acts as a mask (m(SLA)). The resin printers are commercially available for home use, 
cheap, and easy to operate.
