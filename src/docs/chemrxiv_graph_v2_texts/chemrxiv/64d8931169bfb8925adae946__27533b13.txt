Description:
A material that has been reported to feature superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure after doping with copper.

Text:
Lead apatite has been recently reported to feature superconductivity at room temperature and ambient 
pressure after different treatments, including doping with copper.1,2 This material, denoted as LK99,1 
was also a key part of an earlier patent application, together with large group of other ceramic 
materials.3 Due to the tremendous expected impact of such discovery on the progress of humanity, as 
highlighted by Lee et al.,1 these reports stimulated various research groups to confirm the discovery.4
7 Part of the groups were successful, while others have not confirmed the reported results, although 
they synthesized and studied the properties of the material, described in the report. So far, all those 
experimental works have not been summarized and analyzed systematically.

Description:
A mineral that can incorporate various elements such as lead and copper into its structure.

Text:
Several other manuscripts on theoretical explanation, based on computational modeling, also 
appeared. They were focused on the application of density functional theory method to periodic 
structure of the lead apatite and its doping with copper and followed the changes in the electronic
