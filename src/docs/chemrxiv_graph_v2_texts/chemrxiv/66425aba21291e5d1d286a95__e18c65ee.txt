Description:
A compound synthesized through atroposelective total synthesis.

Text:
The most challenging aspect of the synthesis of micitide 
982 (1) lies in the construction of the highly strained atrop
TyrTrp linkage composed of three amino acid residues. Re
cently, we reported the atroposelective total synthesis of ci
hunamide B.4 In the total synthesis of cihunamide B, a biaryl 
linkage was established early in the synthesis, followed by 
the construction of the highly strained atropTrpTrp link
age through atroposelective Larock macrocyclization
