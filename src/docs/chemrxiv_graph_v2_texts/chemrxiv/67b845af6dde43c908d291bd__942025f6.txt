Description:
Used in food packaging, films, and containers due to high barrier properties, chemical resistance, and mechanical durability.

Text:
Due to their exceptional performance, semicrystalline polymers have been widely adopted in 
various industries 
 Packaging Industry Polymers such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are used in food packaging, films, and containers due to 
their high barrier properties, chemical resistance, and mechanical durability 3. Automotive  Aerospace Lightweight polymers like polyamides (PA), polyether ether 
ketone (PEEK), and polycarbonate (PC) are employed in fuel tanks, interior components, 
and structural parts to improve fuel efficiency and mechanical performance 4. Biomedical Applications Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers such as polylactic 
acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) are used in drug delivery systems, surgical sutures, 
and implants, supporting advancements in regenerative medicine and bioresorbable devices
