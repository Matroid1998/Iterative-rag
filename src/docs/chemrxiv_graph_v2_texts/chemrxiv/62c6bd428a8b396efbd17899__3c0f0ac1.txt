Description:
A greenhouse gas associated with anthropogenic emissions.

Text:
Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is the
major contribution to global climate change,1 presenting
an urgent challenge to our society.2,3 One of the many
important mitigation strategies for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions is carbon capture.

Description:
A target for capture and sequestration in carbon capture technology.

Text:
Conventional carbon
capture technology involves wet chemical scrubbing us
ing aqueous amines to absorb CO2 at industrial sources
or directly from the air for further sequestration.4 This
strategy, however, has many limitations including low ca
pacities, poor oxidative stability, degradation in presence
of contaminants and large thermal energy demand for
absorbent regeneration.46 In the search for new mate
rials and technologies for carbon capture, electrochemi
cally mediated CO2 capture has emerged as a promising

approach.710 A popular strategy is to use redoxactive
organic compounds as CO2 carriers, with quinones being
the most representative class of compounds.11 Electro
chemical reduction of quinones generates oxyanion nu
cleophiles, which have high binding affinities towards
CO2 and have been reported to concentrate and selec
tively separate CO2.1116 The biggest advantage is that
quinones can be electrochemically regenerated, leading to
energy savings over traditional temperature or pressure
swing processes.
