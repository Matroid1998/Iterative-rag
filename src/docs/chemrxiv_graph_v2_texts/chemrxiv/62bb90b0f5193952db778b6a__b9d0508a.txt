Description:
Readily deposits to lakes and oceans.

Mercury is wellknown as one of the most toxic metals for vertebrates.1,2 It can be released to the 
environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources,3,4 and also from reemissions of 
previously deposited mercury.5,6 Mercury is a global pollutant because of its ability to travel 
through the atmosphere far from emission sources.7,8 Despite that the atmosphere only contain 
0.3 of the total environmental mercury,9 it remains crucial for the mercury cycle because gas
phase mercury redox chemistry1018 greatly influences when and where mercury deposits to 
ecosystems (Figure 1).1923 Specifically, Hg(II) readily deposits to lakes and oceans, while Hg(0) is 
much more likely to be taken up in vegetation.6,9,23

land and snow.
