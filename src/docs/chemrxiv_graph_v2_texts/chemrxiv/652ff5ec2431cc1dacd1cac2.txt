Description:
Used as a benign reductant in asymmetric imine-alkyne reductive coupling.

Text:
The racemic iminealkyne coupling 
reaction is known using diverse stoichiometric metals.4a Jamison first attempted a threecomponent 
alkylative coupling of alkynes, imines, and triethyl borane for synthesizing chiral allyl amine.9 In 2007, 
Krische pioneered the asymmetric iminealkyne reductive coupling employing rhodium10 and 
iridium11 metal complexes using hydrogen as a benign reductant (Schemes 1a). Although versatile 
with diverse imine partners, the later reaction was limited to aliphatic alkynes only, and using 5d 
transition metal catalysts also campaigns for sustainable alternatives. Later, Zhou employed Et2Zn as 
the terminal reductant for iminealkyne reductive coupling using catalytic Ni(0)phosphine (Scheme 
1a).12 However, the methods suffer from chemoselectivity issues from the reductantderived undesired 
alkylative crosscoupling product. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023rknf4 ORCID httpsorcid.org000000015034423X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
