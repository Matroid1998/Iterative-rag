Description:
Used as a metal center in photoactive metal complexes for sustainable photocatalysis and energy conversion.

Text:
The development of photoactive metal complexes with earth
abundant metals holds great promise to enable sustainable 
photocatalysis, (solar) energy conversion and light emitting 
diodes.14 Hence, considerable efforts have been undertaken to 
explore this compound class in the recent years5,6 with creative 
designs utilizing excited states of different characters like 
metaltoligand (MLCT),7 ligandtometal, ligandtoligand 
charge transfer, and metalcentered (MC) states,8,9 covering 
zirconium,1014 vanadium,1518 chromium,1926 iron,2729 manga
nese,3032 cobalt,33,34 copper3537, molybdenum,3842 and zinc as 
metal centers43,44 amongst others. However, elaborate ligand scaffolds are often required to 
unlock the desired longlived excited states for photoactivity 
with earthabundant metals.
