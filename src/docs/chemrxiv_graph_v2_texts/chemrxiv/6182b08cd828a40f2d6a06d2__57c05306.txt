Description:
A specific PBdPEO block copolymer blended with POPC for membrane protein reconstitution.

Therefore, hybrid lipidpolymer vesicles aim to take 
advantage of the robustness and chemical versatility of a polymer membrane as well as the 
biocompatibility and softness provided by a lipid bilayer.6, 7 
While a variety of block copolymer chemical structures have been blended with phospholipids, 
polybutadienepoly(ethylene oxide) (PBdPEO) block copolymers are one of the most commonly 
studied examples.816 PBdPEO containing hybrid vesicles may have potential applications in 
nanomedicine 17 and the augmentation of membrane proteins for biotechnology applications such as 
targeted drug delivery, sensors or artificial cells.8, 16, 18 
Focusing on membrane protein biotechnology, PBd22PEO14 has been blended with POPC lipids for 
the reconstitution of the membrane enzyme cytochrome bo3; all hybrid compositions studied were 
found to maintain  40 of their initial reconstituted protein activity after 41 days storage at 4 C, a 
significant improvement over purely lipid vesicles.8 Further study revealed that 5050 mol PBd22
PEO14POPC hybrid vesicles retain 20 of their initial activity after 500 days storage, where the rate 
of decay in enzyme activity is approximately 5 times slower than for proteoliposomes.19 Other 
membrane proteins have been successfully reconstituted using PBdPEO hybrid vesicles.
