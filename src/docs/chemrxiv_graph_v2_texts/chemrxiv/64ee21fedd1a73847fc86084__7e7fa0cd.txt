An alternative to GLY is the nonselective, broad spectrum, contact herbicide 
phosphinothricin (2amino4methylphosphinobutyric acid), or glufosinate (GLUF), 
originally discovered through the study of Streptomyces viridochromogenes and S. 
hygroscopicus.7,8 Introduced in 1984, GLUF has been primarily sold and distributed as an 
ammonium salt under brands such as Basta, Challenge, Finale, Ignite, and Liberty, 
where it is applied following the emergence of crops to restrict the growth of a wide range 
of weeds and to desiccate crops prior to harvest.
