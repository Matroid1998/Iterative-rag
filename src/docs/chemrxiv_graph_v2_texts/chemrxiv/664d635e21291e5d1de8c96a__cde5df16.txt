Description:
Used in a solution with an oxidant for catalyst-assisted chemical etching of silicon.

Fabricating silicon macro or nano structures is essential for many applications, such as 
energy conversion and storage1,2, nanoelectronics3, chemical sensors4, and solar cells5. The 
advance of the method enables the structured silicon to show better performance and exhibit 
new properties. Thus, many researchers have developed methods for the facile production of 
silicon micro or nano structures. In recent years, catalystassisted chemical etching has been widely studied as one of the 
silicon microfabrication methods. Especially, noble metal nanoparticles have been utilized as 
the catalyst materials, which promote the reduction of the oxidant and inject holes into the 
silicon in a solution consisting of hydrofluoric acid and an oxidant. Therefore, the silicon under 
the noble metal is preferentially oxidized and dissolved.
