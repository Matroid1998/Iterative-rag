Text:
Chiral amines are a widespread structural motif in pharmaceuti
cals, agrochemicals, and natural products.1 Nearly 80 of the 200 
topselling smallmolecule drugs in 2023 contain at least one ni
trogen atom, with 35 containing a nonracemic chiral amine or 
amino acid moiety.2,3 The most versatile method for synthesising 
chiral amines is asymmetric reductive amination, which proceeds 
through the condensation of a carbonyl compound and a prima
ry or secondary amine to give an imine or iminium intermediate, 
followed by asymmetric reduction to the target chiral amine. Due 
to the two variable residues on each substrate, reductive amination 
offers a broad scope, theoretically allowing the convergent synthesis 
of almost any chiral amine (cf. Figure 1a).
