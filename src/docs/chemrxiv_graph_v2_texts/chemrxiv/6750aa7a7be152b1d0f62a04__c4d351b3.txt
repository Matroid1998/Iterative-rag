Description:
Used in heme peroxidases for oxidation reactions.

Text:
Hemecontaining enzymes are powerful and versatile catalysts. They are capable of a vast range of chemical oxidations, requir
ing only O2 or H2O2 and a source of electrons and protons. For 
H2O2dependent oxidations  namely in the heme peroxidases 
 the mechanisms of oxidation have been widely studied,1 but 
the processes involved in proton delivery that accompany the 
OO bond cleavage and the subsequent oxidation of substrate 
are still poorly defined.
