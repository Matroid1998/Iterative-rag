Description:
A support material for PtSn systems in the Oleflex process for PDH.

Some of the most important classes of heterogeneous catalysts are based on bimetallic systems as they facilitate numerous selective 
transformations; some of them being operated on a megaton scale in the petrochemical industry and enabling for instance the pro
duction of shortchain olefins as building blocks for polymers and bulk chemicals.1 In that context, nonoxidative propane dehydro
genation (PDH) has gained a renewed interest in recent years as an alternative propene production route due to a rising propene 
demand and its current, decreasing production via classical cracking routes as a result of changes in refinery technology.14 The 
Oleflex process, based on an alumina supported PtSn system, was one of the first industrially implemented catalysts for PDH in the 
1990s to produce propene.1 Since then, Pt based bi and multimetallic materials have been among the most investigated systems 
for this transformation.
