Description:
A main gas-phase product in the initial stage of RDX pyrolysis.

Text:
Wight and Botcher 4 explored the initial products of RDX pyrolysis by FTIR spectrum;
they found NO and N2O4 are the main gasphase products in the initial stage, illustrating that the NN bond
scission is the first step in the thermal decomposition of RDX crystal. Zhao et al. 5 studied the infrared multiphoton
dissociation (IRMPD) of RDX in a molecular beam using timeofflight velocity spectra (TOFVS). They detected
the major products from laser photolysis (mass range from 22 to 120 amu). It was concluded that the dominant
channel in the RDX decomposition is a concerted symmetric triple fission of the ring in RDX. Khichar et al.6
conducted thermal analysis on RDX using a coupled TGADSCFTIR system.
