Description:
Complexes that are solvated by ionic liquids in nuclear fuel reprocessing.

Text:
The ILs mainly consist of an organic cation (e.g., alkylimidazolium derivatives (MMI), Figure 
1) and an anionic counterpart (e.g., PF6 in Figure 1), and the proper selection of the cation and anion 
determine the hydrophilichydrophobic nature of the ILs. 26 The imidazoliumbased ILs with 
hydrophobic anionic counterparts, such as PF6 or (CF3SO2)2N, form distinct layers with water, which 
helps to separate the REEs from the parent materials via liquidliquid extraction. 18 Besides their use in 
extraction, ILs are now becoming important industrial substances because of their usefulness in nuclear 
fuel reprocessing. 27, 28 They solvate the uranyl complexes 29, 30 and stabilize the unusual oxidation 
states of lanthanides.
