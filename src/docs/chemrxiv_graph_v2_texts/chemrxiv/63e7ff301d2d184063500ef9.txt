Description:
Reactive groups used in chemical crosslinking.

Text:
The nature of the reactive group directs the specificity of the 
crosslinker, there are a many such reactive groups such as maleimides, diazoacetateesters or 
azides. However, Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters are by far the most popular reactive 
group. Our group has designed a novel dual cleavable chemical crosslinker incorporating NHS 
ester reactive groups.13 The popularity of NHSester based aminereactive crosslinkers could be 
attributed to several factors such as the stability of amide linkage to primary amines in proteins at
