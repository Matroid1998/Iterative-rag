Description:
A term used to describe one of the systems in the study, related to poly(2oxazoline).

Text:
Composed 
65 
largely of hydrophobic elements but also more polar tertiary amides, these polymeric entities contain 
66 
readilymodifiable sidechains and thus represent a versatile chemical toolbox that has garnered much 
67 
attention in biomedical sciences in recent years.69
