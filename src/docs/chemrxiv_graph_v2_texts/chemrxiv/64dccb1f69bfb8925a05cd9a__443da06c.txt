Description:
Required to trigger in crystallo P450 reactions.

Text:
A small number of P450s are able to use this pathway 
for catalysis to act as peroxygenases.2026 As this shunt path
ways and these P450 peroxygenases only requires hydro
gen peroxide (H2O2) to initiate reactions, it may be possible 
to trigger in crystallo P450 reactions by simply soaking the 
crystal with peroxide. This could then potentially be used to 
trap and study the reactive intermediates involved in these 
enzyme reactions.
