Description:
A family of compounds where trialkylamines are prominently represented.

Text:
Trialkylamines and their proximal CH positions are attractive loci 
for transformations especially as their privileged representation in 
their alkaloid family. The proclivity towards studying this class of 
compounds, however, is beyond their ubiquity; their relevance 
crosses the borders of natural sciences (Figure 1).1418 Moreover, 
rapid synthetic access to structurallydiverse trialkylamines is 
desired in pharmaceutical research as their minute structural 
variations carry substantial pharmacological effects, for instance, 
in the pharmacological activity of opiates.1921 However, aside 
from the intrinsic basicity of amines, their C(sp3)H positions are 
relatively inert.
