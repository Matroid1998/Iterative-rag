Description:
Organically bound fluorine in environmental and human samples is often unexplained by routinely analyzed PFAS, indicating anthropogenic chemicals.

Text:
Therefore, PFAS are considered to be regulated as a chemical class 
54 
in the European Union in the future 13. 55 
Several studies have shown that considerable fractions of organically bound fluorine (e.g., 
56 
extractable organic fluorine) in environmental and human samples cannot be explained 
57 
sufficiently by routinely analyzed PFAS (target screening), which usually include less than 50 
58 
analytes 1417. Since almost no fluorinated organic compounds occur naturally, unknown 
59 
fractions of organically bound fluorine are clear indications of anthropogenic chemicals 18. 60
