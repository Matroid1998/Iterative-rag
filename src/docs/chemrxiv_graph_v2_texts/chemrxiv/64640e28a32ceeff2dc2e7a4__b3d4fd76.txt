Description:
A thiol-containing biomolecule used to conjugate with aspirin.

Text:
One approach to improve the solubility is to conjugate aspirin with a
thiolcontaining biomolecule, such as cysteine, through a thioester linker. In the body, the
presence of a redox environment, which involves the interplay of oxidizing and reducing
agents, can influence the behavior of the aspirincytosine conjugate.

Description:
Contains thiol groups that participate in facile redox chemistry, enhancing drug stability and cell permeability.

Text:
The conjugates linker,
designed to be sensitive to thiolcysteine, reacts with the thiol groups of cysteine residues
present in various biomolecules, such as proteins or glutathione, which act as reducing
agents.This approach can take advantage of the thiol sensitivity of the conjugate, as well as
cysteines facile redox chemistry, which can enhance drug bioavailability and efficacy by
increasing stability and cell permeability.7 In this study, we investigate the role of
thiolsensitivity in modulating the bioavailability and efficacy of drug candidates using an
aspirincysteine conjugate with a thioester linkage. We synthesized the conjugate using a
thiolcleavable linker and evaluated its bioavailability and efficacy in vitro. Our results
demonstrate the potential of thioesterbased thiol switch approaches for drug development
and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying thiolcysteine sensitivity. 3.

Experimental Methods
a. Synthesis of AspirinCysteine
The
synthesis
of
the
aspirincysteine
conjugate
was
performed
using
N(3dimethylaminopropyl)Nethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride
(EDC)
and
Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as coupling agents. First, cysteine and aspirin were activated
in separate reactions by reacting it with EDC and NHS in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
room temperature for 2 hours. The activated cysteine and aspirin were then combined in
DMSO and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours under nitrogen atmosphere. The EDC
method creates a thioester bond between the carboxyl group of the aspirin and the thiol group
