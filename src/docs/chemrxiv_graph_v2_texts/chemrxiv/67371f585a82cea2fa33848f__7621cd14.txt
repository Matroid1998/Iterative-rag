Description:
A Li-rich antiperovskite with high reported ionic conductivities at ambient conditions.

Text:
LiPON,
for example, possesses excellent electrochemical stabil
ity and resistance towards dendrite formation23, yet
poormediocre conductivities of the order of 106S cm1
are typically observed21), making it suitable for small
scale devices or as a protective layer in conventional
lithium battery cells.24 Whilst a lower conductivity
would intuitively be expected in the solid state com
pared to the liquid state, competitively high conductiv
ities ( 103 S cm3) are observed for some solid state
materials.25 However, some expected issues do arise with
respect to stability and synthesis of these materials.8
Within the past decade, Lirich antiperovskites, such as
Li3OCl have gained a lot of interest due to their ini
tial high reported ionic conductivities at ambient condi
tions (103 S cm1) as reported by Zhao and Daemen26.

Description:
Possesses a wide electrochemical stability window despite being metastable.

Text:
Subsequent experimental and density functional theory
(DFT) studies, however, have placed the conductivity to
be much lower with a higher migration barrier(0.6 eV
and 106 S cm127,28). Both nominally Li3OCl and
Li3OBr have been shown to possess wide electrochemical
stability windows even if they are metastable and not in
a global ground state. This has been attributed due to its
lack of reducible cations to Limetal, yet may form Li2O
and LiClBr at the anode.29 Additional antiperovskite
ionic conductor compositions have been reported includ
ing, Na3OClBr30,31, Na3SI32 and Na3HS33 to name a
few. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024n3zvr ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000262421121 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
