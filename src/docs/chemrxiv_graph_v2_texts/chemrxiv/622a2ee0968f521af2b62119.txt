Description:
Bioactive compounds mainly including hesperidin in the juice and peel.

Text:
Characterized by numerous healthbeneficial bioactive 
compounds such as flavonoids (mainly hesperidin in the juice and 
peel), limonoids (limonoid glucosides abundant in juice and pulp 
and limonoid aglycones in the seeds) and anthocyanins (malvidin
3Oglucoside), blood orange is a highly valued sweet orange 
(Citrus sinensis) variety.9 Not used as an edible fruit due to its 
bitter and sour taste, bitter orange (Citrus aurantium), in its turn, 
is particularly rich in phenolic acids (mainly ferulic acid and p
coumaric acid) contained both in the pulp and in the peel,10 
alongside naringin, neohesperidin and rutin chiefly contained in 
the peel.11 Finally, bitter oranges concentrate in the peel high 
levels of a protoalkaloid, psynephrine, with sympathomimetic 
activity and high lipolytic action in human adipose tissue, thanks 
to which bitter orange standardized extracts are used as safe (at the 
commonly used doses) weight lossweight management dietary 
supplement.12 
 2 Materials and methods 
2.1 Sample preparation 
Both IntegroPectin materials were obtained using the HCbased 
extractor previously described in detail.4 For red (blood) orange 
IntegroPectin, a 40 kg sample of industrial waste orange peel 
kindly donated by Campisi OPAC (Siracusa, Italy) was processed.
