Description:
Involved in the oxidation to CO2 by molecular oxygen.

This prevents the explicit, atomistic modelling 
of the full catalytic progression.5 Indeed, the surface motifs that 
are present under reaction conditions and the reaction 
mechanisms that operate on those surfaces are typically 
unknown and continuously adapt to the progress of the reaction 
and the associated changes in chemical potential. The CO oxidation to CO2 by molecular oxygen is an example of 
an important reaction for environmental catalysis and for the 
purification of hydrogen for energy generation.6 This reaction can 
be catalyzed by perovskite oxides.3, 
67 However, the 
mechanisms operating on perovskites are not well understood.
