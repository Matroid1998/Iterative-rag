Description:
Myxobacterial terpenoids of special interest due to their underrepresentation within known myxobacterial natural products.

These 
secondary metabolites were found to exhibit both antibacterial and 
antifungal properties.9 Production of indiacen A and B was also 
observed in S. defensii MSr10575 in a comparative study between 
supercritical fluid and conventional extraction, where we additionally 
detected myxochelin A and terrestribisamid A in the strains extracts 
and characterized a group of plasmidencoded nonribosomal peptide
polyketide (NRPSPKS) hybrids after activation of their underlying 
biosynthetic machinery, the sandarazols.10 Myxobacterial terpenoids 
such as the indiacens are of special interest, as they are significantly 
underrepresented within the known myxobacterial NPs, despite their 
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) being not particularly rare.11 
Besides 
some 
small 
terpenoids, 
such 
as 
geosmin 
and 
germacradienol12which were first discovered and isolated from 
actinobacteriaonly few myxobacterial terpenes, such as salimyxin, 
cystodienoic acid, enhygromic acid or the aurachins, were 
described.13,14 Among those, only the strongly bioactive aurachins 
belong to the class of alkaloid terpenoids, making the sandacrabins
