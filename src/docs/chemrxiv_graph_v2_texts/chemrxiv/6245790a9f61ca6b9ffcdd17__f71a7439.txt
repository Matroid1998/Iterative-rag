Description:
Facilitates the coupling of carboxylic acids and aryl halides under photochemical, electrochemical, or thermal conditions.

Text:
In recent years, nickel catalysis has enabled the formation 
of challenging Cheteroatom bonds, resulting in previously 
elusive crosscoupling reactions that can now be performed 
under mild conditions.13 An example hereof is the coupling 
of carboxylic acids and aryl halides to form Oaryl esters en
abled by (dtbbpy)NiX2 under photochemical48, electro
chemical9 or thermal reaction conditions10 (Figure 1A). This 
crosscoupling reaction is notably demanding due to the 
low nucleophilicity of the carboxylate group.
