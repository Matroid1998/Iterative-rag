Description:
A class of compounds that includes glyphosate, used as herbicides.

Text:
The organophosphate glyphosate (GP) is the active ingredient in herbicide products such as 
RoundUp, and is the most used herbicide in the world.13 GP persistence in soil has been 
shown to range from days to months, and the halflife increases if the compound reaches water 
sources through erosion or leaching.48 Due to its environmental persistence and widespread use 
in agricultural and urban settings, GP has been detected in groundwater and surface water, as 
well as in human urine samples.811 While not as lethal as the phosphoric acid ester compounds 
used as chemical warfare agents and pesticides, GP has been shown to cause damage to human 
cells, and exposure has been linked to an increased risk of nonHodgkins lymphoma and 
multiple myeloma.1215 Moreover, GP exposure through drinking water has been shown to cause 
developmental defects in animals.16,17 Therefore, GP contamination of water supplies poses a 
serious environmental and human health concern, leading the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to set a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) for GP of 700 ppb.1720 
Environmental degradation of GP occurs primarily through the enzymatic activity of bacteria in 
soil and proceeds via two main pathways.21,22 The first involves cleavage of the CN bond by 
GP oxidoreductase (GOX), resulting in the formation of glyoxylate and aminomethylphosphonic 
acid (AMPA).2123 The formation of AMPA is undesirable, as it exhibits similar toxicity and a 
longer halflife than GP, has been shown to interfere with DNA synthesis and repair in fish and 
amphibians, which can also have adverse effects on human blood cells.2428 The second pathway 
involves the cleavage of the CP bond by CP lyase, leading to the formation of phosphate and 
sarcosine.2326 The CP lyase pathway is more desirable, as its degradation products are benign 
and can be used as nutrients by soil microorganisms.29,30 Several bacterial and fungal species 
have been studied for biodegradation of GP in water.21,31 Enzymatic degradation has the 
advantage of control over degradation products.21,32 However, the performance of 
microorganisms for GP remotion depends on factors such as pH, temperature, and GP 
concentration.30 Furthermore, expression of the GPdegrading enzymes by microorganisms 
relies on cellular deficits of nitrogen and phosphorus, representing conditions which are not 
typical in natural environments polluted by GP.30 
Adsorption is the simplest and most costeffective method for GP removal.
