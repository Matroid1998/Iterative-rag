Description:
Designed to be highly selective for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Text:
Identifying candidate compounds with high selectivity for a drug target protein is an essential
factor for avoiding development failures related to pharmacokinetics and toxicity issues.1
For example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib and
gefitinib were designed to be highly selective for EGFR and much less potent for other
EGFR family kinases, such as receptor proteintyrosine kinase erbB2 (HER2ERBB2) and
erbB4.2,3 Additionally, various properties, such as pharmacokinetics endpoints4 and drug
likeness indices,5 should be optimized to suitable criteria intended for lead compounds or
clinical candidates.
