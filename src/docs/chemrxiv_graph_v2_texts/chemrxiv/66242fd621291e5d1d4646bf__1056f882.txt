Description:
Used as a catalytic amount in electrolysis to facilitate cyclization of alkynes and nitriles.

Text:
Recently, electrochemical transformations have 
undergone a renaissance,27 and in the context of this study, 222 
electrochemical homo cyclotrimerizations of alkynes to arenes have 
been explored recently (Figure 1D).28 We demonstrate here an in
termolecular cyclization strategy of alkynes and nitriles providing 
2,3,6trisubstituted pyridines via constantcurrent electrolysis using 
the combination of a catalytic amount of triphenylamine (TPA) and 
benzoic acid as a redox shuttle which obliviates the use of metals and 
other external additives (Figure 1E). The crosscyclization of two 
different alkynes is especially possible, being to the best of our 
knowledge, unprecedented. Moreover, a competitive alkyne 
222 cyclotrimerization is not observed. TPA
