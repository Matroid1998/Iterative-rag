Description:
Able to withstand strong ultraviolet radiation.

This hinders their applications in
lightemitting diodes that require highly ecient concentrated emitters in solid states. In this article we demonstrate that bright photoluminescence from TCNQ, which hardly
luminesces in its solid state, by encapsulating it into crystalline melamine. The photolumi
nescence quantum yields of TCNQ and the anion radical TCNQ.are typically low due to
fast (ps  fs) internal conversion 6, 7. A better luminescence quantum yield was reported
only for some nonpolar solvents 8, 9, and prolonged uorescence lifetimes for some micro
solvation complexes of TCNQ 10. Melamine, or 2,4,6Triamino1,3,5triazine, is able to
withstand strong ultraviolet radiation, which also might be a likely reason for its abundance
in the primordial soup.
