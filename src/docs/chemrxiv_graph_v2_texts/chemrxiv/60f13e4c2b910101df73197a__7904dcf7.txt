Description:
Oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide with mCPBA.

was chosen, as a suitably protected 
counterpart to 5 is not readily available. The protected and 
tetrabrominated compound 721 (Scheme 1b) was identified 
as an appropriate starting material. 7 enables the 
construction of carbonsulfur bonds through bromo
lithium exchange, followed by quenching with dimethyl 
disulfide.22 The resulting methyl thioether is oxidized to the 
corresponding sulfoxide 8 with mCPBA.20, 23 Avoiding the 
use of superstochiometric amounts of mCPBA in addition to 
the application of low reaction temperatures proved to be 
crucial for preventing overoxidation to the sulfone. A 
Pummerer rearrangement24 using modified literature 
conditions and subsequent removal of the methyl group 
protecting groups with boron tribromide yielded 2 in 22  
overall yield over four steps. A similar synthetic route was 
followed for the monothiol macrocycle 3 (Scheme 1c).
