NiOOH primarily exists in four different phases, with
NiOOH identified as the most active for catalytic activ
ities. 5, 13, 14 The crystalline structure of NiOOH is
not fully understood but is generally described as NiOOH
layers bonded by hydrogen bonds. 1517 Experimental
and theoretical studies suggest that hydrogen atoms are
randomly distributed between the nickel layers. 16, 18
In the mechanism proposed by Fleischmann et al. 19,
20, the NiIIINiII transition is thought to be key in the
electrochemical behavior of nickelbased oxides during so
called indirect oxidation reactions. In these reactions, the
electron is transferred to NiIII, instead of being directly
injected in the electrical circuit.
