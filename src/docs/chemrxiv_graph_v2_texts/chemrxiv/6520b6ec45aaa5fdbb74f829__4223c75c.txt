Description:
A class of natural products with a dense network of functional groups and high molecular complexity.

Text:
Densely functionalized natural products continue to capture 
the attention of synthetic chemists for their distinctive and 
complex molecular architectures. The aminocyclopentitol class 
of natural products, including pactamycin 1, jogyamycin 2 and 
related compounds (Figure 1), are a unique subgroup of 
natural products that display a dense network of functional 
groups and a high degree of molecular complexity.
