Description:
A flavonoid that inhibited MERSCoV Mpro.

Text:
After reports about the crystal structure of 
Mpro from SARSCoV2 with an inhibitor 3,4, many attempts to evaluate inhibitors, 
including natural chemicals, have proceeded in in silico study. 55 
Food is a good source for health promotion; it can supply beneficial 
phytochemicals to humans. Thus, the daily consumption of phytochemicals could help 
strengthen our body against diseases, such as COVID19. Formerly, experimental studies 
for the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on the recombinant protease from SARSCoV1 
(classic) or MERSCoV have been reported; some flavonoids, including herbacetin and 
60 
quercetin 3Oglucoside, inhibited MERSCoV Mpro 5. SARSCoV1 Mpro was 
inhibited by flavonoids and flavones, such as herbacetin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, apigenin, 
luteolin, quercetin, and amentoflavone 6,7.
