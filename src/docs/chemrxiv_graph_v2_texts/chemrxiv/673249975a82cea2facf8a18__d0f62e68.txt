Description:
Aryne precursors with limited functional group compatibility due to the requirement of strong bases.

Text:
Moreover, the synthetic 
sequence to access otrimethylsilyl aryl triflates requires 
strong bases and consequently the functional group com
patibility of these aryne precursors is actually quite limited 
with respect to the aryl substituents (Rgroup in Scheme 
1a). On balance, although generation of arynes is mild, o
trimethylsilyl triflates do not provide efficient access to 
diversely substituted arynes and novel aryne precursors 
are needed to continue advancing synthetic capabilities 
with these reactive intermediates.
