Description:
A component in mononuclear quasiD5h symmetric complexes with strongly axial ligands.

Yet to now, mononuclear quasiD5h symmetric complexes 
with strongly axial ligands exhibit excellent performances 
among 
SMMs.9,19 
The 
molecule 
Zn2Dy(TTTTBr)2MeOHNO33MeOH published by our group 
(labeled as Ref) came into our mind, in which the coordination 
geometries of Dy(III) can be altered by the counter anions as 
well as the terminal ligands.19a, 20 Herein we report a thorough 
investigation of a family of five Dy(III) SIMs with quasiD5h local 
symmetry whose general formula can be expressed as 
Zn2Dy(TTTTCl)2LAnionSolv
