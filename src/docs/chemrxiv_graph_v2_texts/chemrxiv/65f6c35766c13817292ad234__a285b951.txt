Description:
A surface that can sorb or partition organic contaminants from water.

Text:
The concept of solute hydrophobicity has been of extensive use 
in environmental chemistry to estimate the extent of sorption or 
partitioning of organic contaminants from water to nonaqueous 
phases such as natural organic matter, carbon surfaces, and 
biological lipids.

Description:
Involved in the soil-sediment organic carbon-water (Koc) partition coefficient.

Text:
For neutral organic compounds, the 
octanolwater partition coefficient (Kow) has been considered as 
a scale of solute hydrophobicity because Kow correlates well with 
various relevant partition coefficients, including soilsediment 
organic carbonwater (Koc) and biological phospholipid 
membranewater (Klipw) partition coefficients on the loglog 
scale, particularly when only a specific set of compounds with 
similar 
interaction 
properties 
(e.g., 
nonpolar 
aromatic 
compounds) are considered.14 For this reason, Kow is accepted 
or being introduced as chemical assessment criterion to account 
for the environmental mobility and bioaccumulation potential of 
chemicals in regulations such as the EU CLP and REACH 
regulations and the Stockholm Convention.58 However, for ionic 
compounds, i.e., compounds carrying one or more charges, the 
equilibrium concentration ratio between octanol and water 
highly depends on the coexisting electrolyte concentrations, and 
thus the Kow of ionic compounds cannot be defined in isolation 
from the experimental conditions.9,10 Moreover, even if Kow at a 
specific condition is chosen as a reference, the bulk partition of 
ionic compounds between octanol and water may not represent 
their actual environmental and biological partition mechanisms 
and thus such Kow does not serve as a useful metric.11,12 
Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been of high 
environmental concern due to their recalcitrance to degradation.
