Description:
A solvent in which the emission of oICzIr is measured at 527 nm.

Text:
reported a 
bright red emiUer, ICzqzIr (PL  605 nm and FPL  86 in hexane), achieved by making the 
coordinaTng moiety of the CN ligand much more paccepTng (Figure 1);10 notably, this complex is 
much brighter than the parent emiUer, piqIr (FPL  68 in hexane). Liao et al. invesTgated the eect 
of nitrogendoping in the iCz moiety in Ir(NICz)2(tdm). This structural change leads to a blueshiged 
emission (PL  500 nm in DCM).7compared to Ir(pyiCz)2(tdm) (PL  567 nm in DCM) and oICzIr (PL 
 527 nm in toluene). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20241m0q7 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000171836022 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
