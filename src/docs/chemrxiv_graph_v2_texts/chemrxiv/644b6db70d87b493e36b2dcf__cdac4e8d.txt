Description:
Studied in complexes with manganese, palladium, and platinum for potential use in photodynamic therapy.

Text:
The intriguing question as to their suitability as photosensitizers in 
photodynamic therapy also remains unanswered. Herein we have made an attempt to shed light 
in these questions, focusing on manganese, palladium and platinum complexes of 6
azahemiporphycenes (Chart 1). Chart 1. Complexes studied in this work. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
(a) Synthesis of freebase and transition metal derivatives. As a prelude to systematic studies 
of transition metal derivatives, we chose to optimize the literature synthesis of freebase 6
azahemiporphycenes. The reported method consists of the interaction of a freebase meso
triarylcorrole with 4aminotriazole in the presence of potassium hydroxide in refluxing toluene.6 
In our hands, the protocol led to somewhat inconsistent yields. The reported involvement of 
isocorrole intermediates suggested an improved synthetic strategy. Following a recent synthesis
