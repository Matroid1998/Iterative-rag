Description:
A gas targeted for capture in porous carbon materials.

Text:
Porous carbons have been extensively investigated for their po
tential use in gas storage andor capture applications, in partic
ular related to energy storage applications including for alterna
tive fuels such as H2 and CH4 or for CO2 capture.19 A materials
capacity for a particular sorptive is known to be related to the
porosity of the material, and in particular the pore width plays an
important role.5,1021 Pore entrances for sorption of some gas at
a given pressure and temperature must be large enough for the
molecule in question can diffuse into it.
