Many molecules of the phenanthridine group are used as fluorescence tags in gel electrophoresis due 
27 
to their high quantum efficiencies and stability 1, 2, 3. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is one of the most 
28 
used phenanthridine compounds, due to its ability to bind nucleic acids, and has been documented in
