Description:
The central metal in Pt2(dvtms)3, coordinated by dvtms and NHC ligands.

Later, a new and more efficient Pt
46 
catalyst type, namely Pt2(dvtms)3, a complex of Pt0 with the dvtms ligand (where dvtms 
47 
is divinyltetramethyldisiloxane), was developed and suggested by Karstedt in 1973.4 
48 
This catalyst is more active and wellsoluble in organic solvents (and in siloxane 
49 
environments).4 In 2002, Marco presented a Ptcomplex where one of the weakly 
50 
coordinating dvtms ligands in Karstedts catalyst was replaced by a strongly 
51 
coordinating Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC), i.e., Pt(dvtms)(NHC).5a The strong binding 
52 
of the Pt0center by the NHC ligand prevents the formation of colloidal platinum which, 
53 
in addition to being able to catalyze a number of side reactions (reduction and 
54 
isomerization of alkenes), contaminates the reaction product.
