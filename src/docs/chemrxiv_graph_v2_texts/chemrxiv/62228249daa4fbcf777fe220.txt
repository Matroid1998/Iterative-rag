Description:
A metal with a relatively small ionization potential used in n-type doping.

Doping is essential in achieving any functional organic semiconductor with a high carrier 
concentration regardless of its pntype categorization. One common method of ntype doping in 
organic semiconductors is to treat them with inorganic species that have relatively small ionization 
potentials (e.g. hydrazine vapor, iodine vapor, sodium metal, etc.) or, more commonly, to combine 
them with other organic compounds with relatively low electron affinity.14 This is typically 
accomplished by combining the dopant with the host in the solution phase and casting the mixture 
into thin films. In many instances, the dopants tend to aggregate together and phase segregate from 
the host, ultimately altering the morphology of the resulting solidstate matrix.
