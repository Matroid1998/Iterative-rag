Description:
Upregulation in tumor tissue is connected with increased lysophosphatidyl acyltransferases expression.

Text:
recently 
showed that upregulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 181160 in tumor tissue is indeed connected 
with the increased lysophosphatidyl acyltransferases1 (LPCAT1) expression compared to surrounding 
healthy material showcasing the need of structurally resolved lipidomics workflows.5 
For this reason, multiple new methods have been developed that that track lipid structure changes, 
mainly relying on mass spectrometry (MS).3 Sensitive detection with direct infusion methods, or 
shotgun MS, of lipids has been implemented on multiple stateoftheart mass spectrometric 
platforms.
