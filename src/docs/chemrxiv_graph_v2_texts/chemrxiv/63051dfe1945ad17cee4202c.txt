 Due to the sheer number of PFAS species, in vivo and in vitro biological experiments are 
54 
both timeconsuming and costly. As such, the construction of predictive and reliable 
55 
quantitativestructure activity relationship (QSAR) models68 is essential for assessing the 
56 
bioactivities of these contaminants (even for PFAS species that are yet to be made). Specifically, 
57 
a QSAR model that can accurately predict the bioactivities of PFASs can be harnessed to screen 
58 
several of these contaminants, saving immense time and experimental resources. While there 
59 
have been prior machine learning studies on PFAS molecules,9,10 most of these approaches
