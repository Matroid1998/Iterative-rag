Description:
A type III RIPK1 inhibitor that primarily targets an allosteric site.

To our knowledge, three groups have independently reported 
the development of RIPK1 PROTACs in 2024 (Figure 1A).21
23 Compounds R1ICR5 and LD4172 are based on type II 
RIPK1 inhibitors, which bind to the inactive kinase confor
mation. These compounds demonstrated in vivo efficacy in 
syngeneic mouse models when combined with antiPD1 ther
apy andor XRT. R1ICR5 was delivered through intratumor
al injection, while LD4172 was administered via intraperito
neal (i.p.) injection. In contrast, compound MS2031 is based 
on a type III RIPK1 inhibitor, primarily targeting an allosteric 
site. These reports highlight the growing interest in developing 
effective PROTACbased therapies for RIPK1associated dis
eases. However, the in vivo efficacy of compounds R1ICR5 
and LD4172 was demonstrated only in murine tumor models 
within syngeneic mouse systems.
