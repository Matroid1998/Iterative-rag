Description:
Complexes with enhanced stability and axial crystalfield strength due to F ions.

of intra and intermolecular 
interactions to stiffen the molecule, the introduction of terminal 
F ions in the related molecular solids has been proven to be 
useful for enhancing the stability and axial crystalfield strength 
(CFS) of dysprosium(III) complexes.3335 In addition, the fluoride 
ligands used as equatorial ligands can reduce transversal CFS 
due to the withdrawing effects from F ions.3638 However, there 
is no experimental result to show the effect of swapping CH 
bonds with CF bonds on the Raman process. If we view 
chemical bonds as a harmonic oscillator system, the stronger 
CF bonding energy (485 kJmol) over that of the CH bond 
(414 kJmol) will lead to more optical phonons with higher 
frequencies,3940 which in return reduce the Raman process.
