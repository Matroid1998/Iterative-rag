Description:
Atomic nitrogen used to passivate pore edges in graphene studies.

Text:
Extensive computational studies have been conducted to analyze gas transport from graphene 
pores10,45,46 since attractive gas separation from graphene pores was first predicted in the year 
2009.4 For simplicity, early studies probed pore edges devoid of functional groups and assumed 
rigid apertures with a fixed porelimiting diameter.4752 Other studies probed pore edges passivated 
with atomic H, N, or O, however, gas transport was still investigated, assuming a rigid aperture with 
a fixed PLD.4,49,5358 When lattice flexibility and vibrational dynamics were included, PLD 
modulation59 and enlargement60 were predicted, resulting in an increased gas permeance.11 Pores 
decorated with the CO group have not been studied. One expects the pore edge CO group to 
interact strongly with polar molecules such as CO2 and even flipflop across the plane of the pore.
