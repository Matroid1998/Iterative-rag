Description:
Lipids with unsaturated fatty acids have a kink in the aliphatic chain that introduces packing defects in the lipid bilayer.

Microorganisms often encounter various extreme challenges of the environment, which 
trigger continual adaptations of the cell membrane12. Under physiological condition, cell 
membrane is fluidic, which is necessary for performing its role in different cell biological 
processes. Drastic reduction of temperature is detrimental to the cell membrane since it may 
cause fluidtogel phase transition of the lipid bilayer36 . In response to the environmental stress 
factors, the microorganisms have developed some key strategies, such as lipid remodelling 
homeoviscous adaptation719, introducing small polar organic molecules (osmolytes)3, 2028 , etc. Lipids with unsaturated fatty acids (LUFAs) having kink in aliphatic chain introduces packing 
defects in the bilayer of lipids with saturated fatty acids (LSFAs) and thereby retain the 
membrane fluidity at lower temperature.
