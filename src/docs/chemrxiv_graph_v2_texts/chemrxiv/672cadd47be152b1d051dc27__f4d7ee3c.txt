Description:
Ligands known to cover a large range of electronic properties and used in homogeneous catalysis.

Therefore, to predict the efficiency of catalysts, ligand descriptors have 
undergone significant development in recent years.4 Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) 
and related Cdonor ligands, known to cover a large range of electronic properties,5 
are widely used in homogeneous catalysis.6 Many experimental descriptors of their 
bonding capability, such as the Tolman (TEP)7, Lever (LEP)8 and Huynh (HEP)9 
electronic parameters or other indicators based on NMR approach, have been 
proposed.10,11 TEP and LEP (also referred to as ligand electrochemical parameter) both 
measure the overall donation capability of a ligand L, using respectively the CO 
stretching frequencies in the IR spectrum of Ni(CO)3L or other tetrahedral complexes, 
and the redox potential of MCl(COD)L complexes (M  Rh, Ir).12 For its part, HEP is 
based on the 13C NMR chemical shift of transPdBr2(iPr2bimy)L complexes and 
primarily measures the donor strength of ligand L. The acidity of carbenes can be 
estimated experimentally by measuring the 31P or 77Se chemical shift of carbene
phosphinidene13 or carbeneselenium14 adducts, respectively.
