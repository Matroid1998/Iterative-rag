Description:
Oxygen-containing derivatives showing low LUMO energies and wide visible light absorption.

The inclusion of 
oxygen atoms6 in the skeleton of PAHs lead to applications ranging from chiroptics7 and spintronics8 to 
organic electronics9 and photocatalysis.10 Bonifazi and coworkers11 have extensively studied the 
synthesis and properties of oxygendoped PAHs resulting in a collection of functional conjugated systems 
for electrochromic displays,12 photocatalysis,13 charge transport,14 and nonlinear optics.15 These oxygen
doped PAHs are prepared through a coppercatalysed oxidative CH activation of hydroxydecorated 
PAHs precursors.16 The vast majority of these materials are electronrich, ptype materials. The 
exploration of electron poor, ntype, Odecorated PAHs lags behind and few examples have been reported 
so far. Notable examples are coming again from Bonifazi and coworkers17 who reported oxygen
containing rylene diimide and monoimide derivatives showing low LUMO energies and a wide visible
light absorption.
