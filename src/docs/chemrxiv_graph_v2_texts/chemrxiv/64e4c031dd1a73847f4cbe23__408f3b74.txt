Description:
Studied for its reactivity in alkaline and acidic solutions.

Text:
Austin1 reported that nitrofurazone can be reduced to a glyoxylopropionitrile by means of a reductive fission a 
similar but different reductive fission of nitrofurans has also been reported elsewhere.2 This led Cisak et al.,3 to 
study the reactivity of 5nitrofurfural in alkaline and acidic solutions. In stark contrast to the aforementioned 
reported reactivity of 5nitrofufural in alkaline solutions, almost invariably all the previously reported 
procedures for synthesis of hydrazone 1 have been conducted in highly alkaline hydrazine hydrate in methanolic 
solutions4,5 (Scheme 1). For though Li et al.6 reported that a purum sample of 1 was obtained via a modified 
literature procedure (loc. cit.) the particulars of which was never disclosed, it was not feasible to reproduce such 
findings in this work.

Description:
A compound used in the synthesis of polymeric samples.

Text:
To this end, and in accordance with the aforementioned inferential rationale3 for highly 
impure and somewhat yellow in colour (vide infra) polymeric samples of 1 which were phenomenologically 
obtained via the previously reported procedures, a highly versatile and relatively anhydrous method for 
synthesis of 1 and its derivatives was devised. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023bjkc2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000159202286 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
