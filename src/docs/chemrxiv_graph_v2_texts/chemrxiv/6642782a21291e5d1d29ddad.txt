Description:
Less stable and selective compared to sulfonyl fluorides under catalytic conditions.

Text:
Over the past decade, sulfonyl fluoride exchange (SuFEx) 
chemistry has seen an increase in popularity owing to its use as 
a biocompatible click reaction.1 First introduced in 2014, SuFEx 
chemistry relies upon the exchange of an incoming nucleophile 
with fluoride on a hexavalent sulfur forming an irreversible, 
covalent bond.1c This exchange, however, must occur under 
catalytic conditions whereby both the sulfonyl group and 
departing fluoride group are stabilized by hydrogen bonding. This 
imparts a degree of stability and selectivity on sulfonyl fluorides 
(SFs) not seen with other electrophilic groups such as sulfonyl 
chlorides, epoxides, and acrylamides. When placed in the context 
of an enzyme active site, this catalytic condition is the hydrogen 
bonding associated with donor residues surrounding the 
nucleophilic residue of interest.
