Description:
A scarce and costly element that could pose a supply bottleneck for large-scale deployment of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers.

Text:
Protonexchangemembrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) provide an attractive solution for 
producing hydrogen from carbonneutral energy sources. 1 However, the kinetically sluggish 
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode causes severe energy losses, requiring 
the development of active and stable electrocatalysts. 2 The strongly acidic and oxidizing anode 
environment restricts the choice of catalyst materials to the oxides of platinumgroup metals 
(PGM), with iridium oxides being the current stateoftheart. 2 Due to the scarcity and cost of

bottleneck.

Description:
A metal whose loading needs to be reduced to improve material performance without compromising lifetime.

Text:
3 To avoid this, anodic iridium loading needs to be reduced from 2.0 mgIr cm2 to 
0.4 mgIr cm2 or lower without compromising the lifetime and performance of these materials. 3 

Previous efforts to enhance the utilization of iridium have largely focused on (hydrous) 
amorphous iridium oxides (IrOx) 4 that are commonly considered to be more active towards 
the OER than crystalline rutiletype iridium dioxide (IrO2). 5 Amorphous IrOx typically has a 
mixture of the formal Ir34 oxidation states and a significantly disordered structure. While 
amorphous IrOx provides a higher Irmassspecific electrocatalytic activity, stability is often 
insufficient, thus jeopardizing the strategy for decreased iridium loading under longterm 
operation in a PEMWE. Such an inverse correlation between catalyst activity and stability has 
widely been observed in OER electrocatalysis. 6
