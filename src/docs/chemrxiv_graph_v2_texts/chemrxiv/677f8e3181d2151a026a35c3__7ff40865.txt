Text:
The detection and control of dioxygen concentration are crucial in various fields, including industrial chemistry, 
agrifood, environmental sciences, and clinical analysis.13 As an example, molecular oxygen plays a key role 
in biological processes, making its detection important to understand physiological and pathological 
phenomena. Among all existing techniques (the Winkler, amperometric and pressurebased methods), optical 
methods offer a noninvasive and precise alternative for dioxygen detection, with advantages such as rapid 
response, high sensitivity, and ease of miniaturization, leading to an increased interest in the design of optical 
dioxygen molecular sensors.4 
Since the seminal discovery of Kautsky and Hirsch in 1931,5 it is well established that emission and, more 
particularly, phosphorescence emission of chromophores decreases in the presence of dioxygen.

Description:
In its fundamental triplet state, it is involved in collisional deactivation of chromophore triplet excited states.

Text:
This 
reversible photophysical process involves a collisional deactivation of the chromophore triplet excited state by 
dioxygen in its fundamental triplet state (3).6 This process may lead to the formation of singlet oxygen (1), 
which is detectable through its characteristic luminescence emission or by using a scavenger. The high 
cytotoxicity of these species is instrumental in the development of photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications.7, 
8 In addition, the decrease of luminescence intensity and lifetime provides measurable parameters for dioxygen 
detection. Consequently, the (I0I) and (0) ratios, where I0 and I (respectively, 0 and ) are the luminescence 
intensities (respectively, lifetimes) in the absence and in the presence of O2, can conveniently provide an 
evaluation of molecular probe sensitivity.
