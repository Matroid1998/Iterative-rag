Introduction
This research papers hypothesis is that the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) will
increase with the use of the catalysts of MnO2, PbO2, and Fe2O3, with MnO2 having the highest
catalytic activity and inhibiting the fastest rate of decomposition of Hydrogen peroxide, measured with
the fastest rate of oxygen production.

A well-known and highly effective catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

Text:
In the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, several catalysts can be used to
accelerate the reaction

Manganese dioxide (MnO2) A wellknown and highly effective catalyst2 for the decomposition
of HO. It is often used in practical demonstrations to display catalytic activity due to its strong
catalytic effect.3
