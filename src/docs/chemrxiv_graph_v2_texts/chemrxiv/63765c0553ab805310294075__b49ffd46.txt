Description:
Structural properties in solution can be determined using X-ray crystallography and solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
The structural dependencies of experimental parameters may not be 
understood quantitatively andor the quantity of experimental data used to derive a conformational 
model may be limited, placing greater reliance on the model obtained from calculations. XRay 
crystallography and solidstate 13C NMR spectroscopy have been used synergistically to 
determine the structural properties of carbohydrates in solution by addressing some of the 
limitations discussed above.1924
