Introduction 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are fragments of graphene prepared in various sizes and shapes 
to adapt their optoelectronic properties.1 This structureproperty relationship allows material chemists to 
design conjugated materials with specific properties, tailored for organic electronics devices.2 Introducing 
heteroatoms,3 such as nitrogen4 or sulfur,5 into their core is a powerful strategy to tune their frontier 
orbitals energy, as well as their optical, semiconducting and selfassembly properties.
