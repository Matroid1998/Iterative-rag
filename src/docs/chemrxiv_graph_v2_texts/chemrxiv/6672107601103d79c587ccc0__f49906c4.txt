Description:
A metal used in solid-state batteries, where metallic coatings improve its contact and wetting.

Text:
Specifically, surface cracks can easily result from polishing, uneven applied stack 
pressure, and impacts. The predominant mitigation strategies have focused on decreasing the 
local current density during operation through methods such as interlayers and structural 
modifications.16,17 In particular, metallic coatings are effective for regulating Li electroplating in 
solidstate batteries. Mechanistically, it is believed that metallic coatings improve the contact and 
wetting of Li metal18. Among various metals, metallic silver has stood out for enabling fast and
