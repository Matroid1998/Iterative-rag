The nitrogenase model of N2 fixation has been 
thoroughly investigated and had inspired the 
development 
of 
several 
catalysts 
914. Unfortunately, most of these catalysts use sacrificial 
reductants. Of late the focus has shifted to achieve this 
singularly important transformation electrochemically 
as electricity produced from carbon neutral sources 
such as wind, solar or hydro will render it sustainable 
in the long run 15. Electrochemical N2 fixation has 
emerged as an alternative which holds the promise of 
achieving transformation of N2 to NH3 under mild 
conditions 1618. Instances of Nitrogen fixation yielding N2H4 as the 
major product as opposed to NH3 are scarce. Many 
NRR (Nitrogen Reduction Reaction) molecular 
catalysts form N2H4 as a side product, out of which Fe
