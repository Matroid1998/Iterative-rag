Description:
A product of CO2 hydrogenation with CuZnO.

Text:
The chemical potentials of reactants, products, and intermediates affect the architectures
of catalysts,13 however, the dynamics under reaction conditions remain poorly understood. Tracking these changes requires using complex operando techniques, the results of which are
often difficult to obtain and to interpret due to the average nature of the signals, or the
presence of spectators.2,4 To give an example, structural rearrangements were inferred from
changes in kinetic regimes when using microkinetics for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol
with CuZnO.1 However, models that elucidate the implications of dynamic catalysts on
performance are currently unavailable. Catalytic systems based on firstrow transition metals like Cu and Ni undergo surface
rearrangements in the presence of carbon species, such as CO or CHx fragments.

Description:
A possible minor byproduct in the Reverse Water Gas Shift process.

Text:
However, these phenomena have only been investigated from the perspective of
Surface Science, without considering farther the implications of the observed changes on the
reactivity of the catalyst.3,5,13
Among the reactions that generate CO, the Reverse Water GasShift (RWGS; Equation
1), that recycles CO2 and uses (preferentially green) hydrogen is receiving considerable
attention of late as it can effectively balance industrial feeds.9,1416 The process is endothermic
(H042 kJ mol1; S42 J mol1 K1)14,15,1721 and, under lower temperatures, methane
becomes the main product (H0165 kJ mol1, Equation 2). This reduces the process
efficiency,14,17 and decreases the yield of other possible minor byproducts such as methanol,22
Equation 3.
