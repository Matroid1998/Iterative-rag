Fatty acids are organic compounds consisting of a hydrophilic carboxylic acid head 
and a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain. They are simple amphiphilic molecules with 
significant roles and applications across various fields, including the food industry1, 
daily chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, and medicine2. The reactive carboxylic acid 
group allows fatty acids to conjugate with different backbone structures, enabling the 
formation of new derivatives with unique structures and tailored functions. This 
versatility underpins their wide applications, such as emulsifiers3, surfactants4, and 
building blocks for biocompatible materials 5. In biological systems, fatty acids are primarily found in conjugated forms, such as 
esters 6 or amides 7, which are critical for specific biological functions.

Description:
Conjugated with glycerol to form triglycerides, serving as energy storage molecules.

Text:
For instance, 
fatty acids are conjugated with glycerol to form triglycerides, which serve as energy 
storage molecules8, and with sphingosine to create ceramides9, essential for cell 
membrane integrity and signaling. Beyond their biological roles, synthetic conjugates of fatty acids have attracted 
increasing attention in materials science and drug delivery systems. Fatty acids 
conjugated with polymers or peptides have been explored for creating hydrogels 10, 
liposomes11, and targeted drug carriers12, enhancing their stability and functionality. Fatty acids, as simple amphiphiles, always contain two types of amphiphiles, the non
ionized, neutral form and the ionized form (the negatively charged soap). They can self
assembly to oil droplets, micelles, or vesicles which depends on their deprotonation 
state13.
