Estrogens are steroidal hormones which have been designated as endocrinedisrupting chemicals 
34 
(EDCs).1 The deleterious effects of natural and synthetic estrogens on aquatic ecology has been 
35 
repeatedly demonstrated for nearly 25 years, particularly through production of the femaleassociated 
36 
protein vitellogenin in male oviparous animals.13 As a result, environmental authorities across the 
37 

2 

world have included the most prevalent estrogens  estrone (E1), 17estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and 
38 
synthetic estrogen 17ethinylestradiol (EE2)  in new monitoring watch lists of emerging 
39 
contaminants in water systems.4,5

The role of biological degradation in removing estrogen hormones from water treatment 
41 
systems has been reported in numerous studies, including aerobic degradation through activated sludge 
42 
68 and biofilters9 and anaerobic degradation in waste lagoons.10,11 Recently, the specific biodegradation 
43 
pathways of estrogendegrading environmental bacteria have been elucidated, including Nitrosomonas 
44 
europaea12,13, Novosphingobium spp.14, Sphingomonas spp.
