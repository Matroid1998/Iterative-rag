Description:
Desirable solar absorbers with high optical absorption coefficient, defect tolerance, and tunable band gap.

Text:
Halide perovskites with formula ABX3, where A and B are cations, X is halide, have recently been found 
as desirable solar absorbers.13 Compared with the most widely commercialised silicon solar cell, 
solutionprocessable halide perovskite solar cells have several advantages, including high optical 
absorption coefficient, defect tolerance, and tunable band gap.4 However, the most commonly used 
Bsite metal, Pb, hinders commercialisation due to the high toxicity and the poor intrinsic air stability 
of many Pb(II) based perovskites.5 Thus there is motivation to develop leadfree analogues.
