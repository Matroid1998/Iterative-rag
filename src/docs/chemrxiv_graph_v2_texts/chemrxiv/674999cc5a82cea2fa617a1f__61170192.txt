Description:
Improves performance in selective oxidation reactions and enhances stability of gold particles in catalysts.

Text:
Bimetallic catalysts such as PtNi demonstrate efficiency in oxygen reduction reactions
over their monometallic counterparts.1 Incorporation of Cu into gold catalyst improves its
performance in selective oxidation reactions, such as the oxidation of glycerol to glyceric
acid and CO2 by enhancing the oxygen transfer and improving the stability of gold particles
on the catalyst surface.2,3 AuCu catalysts effectively activate reactants while maintaining
high selectivity making them suitable for the production of useful chemicals from green
house gases.4 Cu doped gold nanoparticles have been employed in CC coupling reactions
like Sonogashira cross coupling reactions and euteriumhydrogen exchange reactions.5,6
The oxidation of alcohols, especially the conversion of primary alcohols selectively to
aldehydes, is an important step in the production of fine chemicals and valuable intermedi
ates.
