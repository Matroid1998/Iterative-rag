and have also been employed as precursors towards the stabilisation of alkylidene complexes.21 
Le Floch and Mzailles developed an analogous ligand, (SPPh2)2CH,22 which was used in 
a similar fashion for the synthesis of homoleptic bismethanide complexes for divalent metals 
or methanidemethanediide species (Figure 1).23,24 Typical synthetic routes to these compound 
include protonolysis of the proligand with Ln tribenzyl25 or trisamido precursors.26 
Alternatively, salt metathesis of a Group 1 salt of the ligand with a metal halide typically yields 
the halidebridged23 or monomeric heteroleptic species.27 Moreover, Chen and coworkers 
prepared an asymmetric analogue of Le Flochs thiophosphoranomethanide ligand (Figure 1), 
SP(Ph)2CHSiR3 (R  Me, Ph).28 This ligand was used to prepare heteroleptic complexes
