Description:
A product formed from the reverse reaction of a diethanolamineacrylonitrile adduct.

Alternatively, for specific azaMichael adducts 
retroMichael reaction can also be promoted by the use of solvents at room temperature or catalysts 
(base) at 60 C.13 Already in 1944, the reverse reaction of a diethanolamineacrylonitrile adduct to 
diethanolamine and poly(acrylonitrile) was demonstrated at 150 C (Scheme 1).14 Recent model 
studies show the amine transfer of an aminealkylacrylate adduct to benzyl acrylate in the temperature 
range of 100  160 C without additional catalyst.15 This finding was further used to build CANs based 
on amino ester which can then be reprocessed at 150 C due to retro azaMichael and 
transesterification reaction.15 Another example combines pH sensitive amidation and heat sensitive 
dynamic azaMichael addition in CANs.16 Moreover, dynamic aminoyne click chemistry at 130 C was 
reported in CANs.17 
In contrast, reports on the utilization of 
retro carbaMichael18 and in particular 
retro oxaMichael reactions in polymer 
chemistry are scarce.
