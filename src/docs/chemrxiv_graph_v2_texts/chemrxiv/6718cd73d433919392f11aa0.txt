Description:
Commonly used in heterocycles as a strong electron donating unit.

Since the discovery of the first purely 
organic TADF emitter by Parker et al.8 in 1961, a lot of work has been devoted to develop new 
and more efficient chromophores suitable for optoelectronic applications.1,2,911 Nowadays, 
there are many fields besides organic LEDs4,1012 in which TADF emitters have been success
fully applied, such as photovoltaic cells,13,14 bio, chemo and photosensors,1517 organic la
sers18 and photocatalysis.19 
To achieve the needed small EST enabling TADF, organic systems bearing donoracceptor (D
A) units require a reduced overlap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) 
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is usually obtained by limiting 
the planarization of the molecule in the excited state.47 Nitrogen containing heterocycles have 
been commonly used as D unit due to their strong electron donating capabilities, stability and 
high triplet states.4 The choice for the A moiety are more widespread ranging from nitrile
based functional groups to diphenyl sulfide or ketonebased groups.4,11,20 Commonly, D and 
A are connected via a nonplanar system that separates the HOMO and LUMO, resulting into 
formation of intramolecular charge transfer (CT) states.
