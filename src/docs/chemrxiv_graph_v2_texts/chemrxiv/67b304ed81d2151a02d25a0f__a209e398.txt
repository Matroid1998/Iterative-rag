Description:
A costly platinum group metal used as a high-yield catalyst in acidic media.

Compared to AWE, PEMWE 
provides the advantage of operating water electrolysis at high 
current densities (2 Acm2), while its locally acidic media calls 
for highyield catalysts, typically restricted to costly platinum 
group metals (PGMs). Against this backdrop, development of 
new catalysts based on earthabundant transition metals, which 
display high catalytic activity under both alkaline and acidic 
conditions, presents an alternative option for advancing the 
commercialization of industrialscale water electrolysis. Over the past decade, numerous nonPGMbased catalysts have 
been explored, demonstrating remarkable catalytic activities for 
water 
electrolysis, 
i.e. alloys,7 
chalcogenides,8,9,10 
coordination polymers,6,1113 intermetallics,14 oxides,15,16,17 
(oxy)hydroxides,18,19 and pnictides,20,21 et al. Among these 
catalysts, their high electrical conductivity and admirable 
catalytic kinetics render transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) 
attractive 
candidates 
for 
overall 
water 
electrolysis.
