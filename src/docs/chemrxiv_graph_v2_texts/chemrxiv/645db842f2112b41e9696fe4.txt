Description:
Used in Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for probing small molecules with single molecule resolution.

Raman scattering is inherently 
weak due to the low probability of the Raman process (6, 7), but adsorbing analytes on the surface 
of certain metal nanoparticles can increase the Raman signal by a factor of 1021014 through 
surfaceenhanced Raman scattering (SERS) caused by the excitation of localized surface plasmon 
resonances of nanoparticle coinage metal resonators (8  11). SERS can detect analytes at very 
low concentrations, which makes it very useful in the study of complex molecules like proteins by 
reducing the requirement for sample concentrations (6, 12, 13). When integrated with scanning 
probe microscopy (SPM), SERS is modified into Tipenhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), 
capable of probing the configuration of small molecules on gold or silver nanotips, with single
molecule resolution (1, 14).
