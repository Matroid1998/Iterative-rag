Accumulates in waterways, soil, or certain tissues, especially in the thyroid gland.

Iodine pollution from nuclear and medical waste (129I and 131I) is a problem for both 
humans and the environment due to its ability to accumulate in waterways, soil or in 
certain tissues, especially in the thyroid gland. Radioactive iodine is a major pollutant in 
nuclear accidents such as the Fukushima ,1 and Chernobyl nuclear power plant disasters 
as well as regular nuclear waste disposal from power generation facilities.24 In fact, after 
1986, thyroid cancer cases spiked tremendously among the people living in vicinity of 
the Chernobyl power plant.5 The biomagnification of radioactive iodine species among the 
local population, particularly children1, was determined to be the cause of disease 
proliferation.

Description:
Can potentially cause thyroid problems, including cancer, when consumed excessively.

Text:
Additionally, excessive iodine consumption (1.1 mgday) on a regular basis 
can potentially cause thyroid problems, including cancer.6 In addition to its ability to 
affect human health, 129I has a very long halflife of 10 million years.7,8 Therefore, it is 
vital and necessary to develop new materials for iodine capture given the detrimental 
impacts.

Description:
A radioactive element that requires removal from industrial waste streams.

Text:
Current methods for removing radioactive iodine from different industrial waste 
streams include wet scrubbing (using alkaline solutions like NaOH or Hg(NO3)2 as well 
as solid phase adsorption (using silver salts, zeolites, minerals containing bismuth 
oxyiodide, activated carbon and others).9,10 However, these methods have drawbacks 
such as the need for complex equipment, hazardous byproduct generation, poor 
absorption capacities, and high cost because of the need for expensive sorbents.7,1113 
For these reasons, the development of alternative, chemically stable materials that can 
collect iodine at low concentrations in aqueous environments, remains a key challenge. To address this problem, researchers have begun to explore the vast library of porous 
organic materials as highperformance adsorbents for iodine pollution.
