Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease in the United States. It is a degenerative 
joint disease predominantly in the hands, hips, and knees, leading to a decrease in joint mobility. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023s9mp3 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000264574305 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0

Osteoarthritis is caused by factors including aging, obesity, and past joint injuries. There is 
currently no cure for osteoarthritis, but there are treatments for its symptoms of pain and mobility 
(Chen et al., 2017). One treatment option for osteoarthritis pain is resiniferatoxin, a capsaicin analog and 
currently the most potent agonist for transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) a non
selective nociceptive ion channel that can be activated by capsaicin, heat, and acid. Resiniferatoxin is found in E. resinifera and E. poissonii.
