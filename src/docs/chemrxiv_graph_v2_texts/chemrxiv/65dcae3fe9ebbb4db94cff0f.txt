Description:
Mycotoxins produced by pathogenic Fusarium fungi, commonly found as contaminants in cereal grains, animal feeds, and food commodities, with remarkable resistance against heat, acid, and digestion.

Text:
Enniatins are mycotoxins produced by pathogenic 
Fusarium fungi1,2 and are commonly found contaminants of 
cereal grains, animal feeds, and food commodities.35 Due to 
their remarkable resistance against heat, acid and digestion, they 
can propagate through food and feed chains.

Description:
Compounds known for their ionophoric behavior, exerting antibacterial, antifungal, antihelmintic, and antiviral activity.

Text:
This group of 
molecules is therefore of increasing concern for human and 
animal health at chronic exposure.6,7 However, at the same time, 
enniatins have come to attention as potential anticancer agents8 
due to their specific cytotoxic properties against malignant 
cells.913 Enniatins are well known for their ionophoric behaviour 
by which they exert antibacterial, antifungal, antihelmintic and 
antiviral activity.14,15 The same behaviour is considered to be 
responsible for the primary mechanism of toxicity against cancer 
cells, which disturbs the physiological homeostasis by 
transporting cations through cell membranes leading to apoptotic 
cell death.3 Since enniatins can be conveniently derivatized 
using the concept of hybrid modular nonribosomal peptide 
synthetases, they present a promising class of anticancer agents 
that need to be explored in terms of their detailed molecular 
mechanism of action.16
