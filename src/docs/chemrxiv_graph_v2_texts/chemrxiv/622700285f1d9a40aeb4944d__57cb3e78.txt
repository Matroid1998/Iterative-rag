Description:
A type of microginin produced by a specific strain.

Text:
Modifications 
of the fatty acyl residue such as terminal halogenation, hydroxyla
tion or Nmethylation are common.10,11 Several microginins were 
shown to inhibit a variety of proteases with considerable potency.12 
Rounge et al13 proposed that microginin production is carried out 
by enzymes encoded in the mic BGC (Fig. 1a), found in the genome 
of the oscillaginin (a type of microginin)producing strain
