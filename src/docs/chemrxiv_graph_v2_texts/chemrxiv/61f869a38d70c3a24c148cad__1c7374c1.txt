Description:
Refers to CeO2 thin films requiring even texturization.

Text:
The procedure for producing CeO2based superhydrophobic films utilized in this work consists of 3 consequent steps 
Fig. 1 1) texturization of the substrate by chemical etching; 2) sputter deposition of the CeO2 thin film; 3) controlled 
adsorption of organic molecules by placing the CeO2coating in a saturated environment of organic materials. The substates used to obtain the superhydrophobic condition for CeO2 were monocrystalline (100) ntype silicon 
wafers with initial thickness d100 m. In order to get even texturization of ceria thin films, the Siwafers were 
chemically etched with a KOH wet process 15. The KOH concentration was maintained at a level of 2 wt. during 
etching. The etching was carried out at 80C for 20 min.
