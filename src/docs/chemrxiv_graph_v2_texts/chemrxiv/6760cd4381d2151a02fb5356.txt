The platform also boasts advanced capabilities, such
as onthecloud microkinetic modeling, an AIpowered chatbot grounded in catalytic data
and knowledge, onthecloud machine learning force eld training, and regression model
development. As of November 29, 2024, DigCat houses over 400,000 experimental data points and
330,000 theoretical structures spanning a diverse array of material types. The database
covers more than 120 catalytic reactions (FIG. 2) and over 200 performance metrics, in
cluding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evo
