Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for emission reduction to decarbonize the energy supply.

Text:
Extensive efforts are underway to
limit carbon dioxide emissions and decarbonize
the energy supply.2 In contrast, methane con
trol is less welldeveloped, despite its climate
impact being 23 as large as that of carbon
dioxide,3 as well as indirect effects on tropo
spheric ozone pollution.4 A new report from
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineer
ing and Medicine has examined Atmospheric
Methane Removal (AMR) and concluded that
there are no commercially available technolo
gies that operate at methane concentrations
