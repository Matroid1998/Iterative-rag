Description:
A host material in which DMACTRZ exhibits skyblue emission.

Text:
An archetype DA TADF emitter is DMACTRZ, first reported by Tsai et al.3 This compound has a 
very small DEST of 0.046 eV in 8 wt doped films in mCPCN resulting from the near orthogonal 
conformation between the dimethylacridine (DMAC) donor and the triazine (TRZ) acceptor. In this 
host, DMACTRZ has a skyblue emission with peak photoluminescence wavelength (lPL) of 495
