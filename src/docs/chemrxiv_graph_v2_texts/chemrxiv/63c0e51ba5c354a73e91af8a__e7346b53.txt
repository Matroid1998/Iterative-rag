Petroleum is associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions, the destruction 
of ecosystems, and the pollution of fresh water and ground soil.1 The carbon footprint 
of these materials will continue to put a strain on the environment as the demand 
increases.2 To overcome these drawbacks but still take advantage of the 
convenience of plastics, it is necessary to take a green chemistry approach to 
develop ecofriendly materials with comparable properties to traditional petroleum
based plastics. One way to achieve this is by utilizing biobased renewable 
feedstocks as starting materials in the design of new polymers. There are a variety of biobased feedstocks that show promise as suitable 
replacements for petroleum. Vanillin, eugenol, and guaiacol are some of the main 
biobased aromatic phenols with different functionalities that allow versatile
