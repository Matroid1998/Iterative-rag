Description:
A compound that precipitates from the dissolution of sulfur into the electrolyte during cycling.

Text:
The primary challenges faced by LiS technology include the insulating nature of 
43 
elemental sulfur (electrical conductivity of 1  1030 S m1 at room temperature) which reduces the 
44 
practical sulfur loading and utilisation achievable due to the need for nonactive conductive 
45 
additives 2. While cathodes can be manufactured with an idealised morphology, the dissolution 
46 
of sulfur into the electrolyte and precipitation of Li2S 1,3, and the subsequent reversal of this 
47 
process, manifest in significant alterations of the cathode morphology of the electrode during 
48 
cycling 4.
