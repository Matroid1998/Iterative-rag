Description:
Forms dihydrogen bonds, a type of weak interaction with longer action distance and lower energy compared to chemical bonds.

Interactions in chemical systems can be divided into two main categories 
chemical bonds and weak interactions. Chemical bonds have a short interaction 
distance and usually have a large strength. They can generally be classified into 
covalent bonds (including coordination bonds and metallic bonds in specific situations) 
and ionic bonds, and the interaction energy is generally several hundred kJmol. Weak 
interactions have a much longer action distance and are about one order of magnitude 
weaker than chemical bonds. They contain a wide variety of types, such as ordinary 
van der Waals (vdW) interactions,1,2 hydrogen bonds (Hbonds),35 halogen 
bonds,68 chalcogen bonds,9,10 pnicogen bonds,11,12 tetrel bonds,13,14 dihydrogen 
bonds,15 regium bonds,16,17  interactions,18,19 and their interaction energy is 
generally several to tens of kJmol.
