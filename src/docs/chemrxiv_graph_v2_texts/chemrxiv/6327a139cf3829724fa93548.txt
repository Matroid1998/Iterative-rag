Description:
Absorbs at 780 nm and features an emission tail beyond 900 nm for SWIR FL imaging.

It is note
worthy, a FL molecule does not need to absorb incident 
light in this window to generate a SWIR signal. For ex
ample, the abs for indocyanine green (ICG) is 780 nm 
but features an emission tail beyond 900 nm that can 
be used for SWIR FL imaging.3 Similarly, most conven
tional PA imaging agents maximally absorb NIR light. However, in this spectral range, dyes must contend 
with PAactive pigments such as haemoglobin, 
resulting in higher background signals.4 In both in
stances, the application of SWIR excitation can lead to 
enhanced tissue penetration, higher signaltoback
ground ratios, and greater sensitivity.
