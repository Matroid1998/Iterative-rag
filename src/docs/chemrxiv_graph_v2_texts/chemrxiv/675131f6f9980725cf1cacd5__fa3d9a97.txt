Description:
A compound used in the double Mannich reaction to construct 3azabicyclo3.1.1heptane.

Bicyclic sp3enriched systems have gained much attention in 
design of biologically active compounds as structural analogs of 
common rings (e.g., benzene, pyridine, piperidine).14 In 
particular, 3azabicyclo3.1.1heptane (1) was proposed to be a 
bicyclic saturated isostere of pyridine5 and piperidine612  two 
heterocycles most widely used in drug discovery (Figure 1, A).13
15 Some known biologically active 3azabicyclo3.1.1heptane 
derivatives include potent aromatase inhibitors16 or purinergic 
receptor P2Y14 antagonists (Figure 1, B).17 
Reported methods for the construction of 3azabicyclo3.1.1
heptane system (Scheme 1) relied on thermal (A),1820 
photochemical (B),16,2123 or metalcatalyzed24 intramolecular 
22 cycloaddition, recyclization of 2oxaspiro3.3heptanes 
(C),5 double Mannich reaction of cyclobutanone,6 or cyclization 
of 1,3substituted cyclobutanederived amino esters (D).7,2527 
Herein, we report very efficient approach to the multigram 
synthesis of 3azabicyclo3.1.1heptanes based on the cyclization 
of cyclobutanederived 1,3dicarboxylic acid derivative 1 (Scheme 
1, E).
