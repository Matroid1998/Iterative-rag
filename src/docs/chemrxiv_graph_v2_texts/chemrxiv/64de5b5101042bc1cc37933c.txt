Description:
An acid whose acidity correlates with the rate of reactions involving substituted aromatic rings.

Text:
The Hammett relationship is a paradigmatic example in which benzoic acid acidity (an experimentally determined 
35 
thermodynamic parameter) correlates with the rate for various reactions involving substrates, reagents, or catalysts bearing 
36 
substituted aromatic rings.3 A linear correlation between reactivity and the inductive and resonance contributions from meta 
37 
or parasubstituents on aromatic rings (m and p Hammett parameters, respectively) reveal the sensitivity of a reaction to 
38 
these electronic influences. Deviations from linearity may be related to changes in the ratedetermining step (e.g., a concave 
39 
downward curve) or in the mechanism or transition state of the reaction (e.g., a concave upward curve).4
