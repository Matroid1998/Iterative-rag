Description:
Used as a molten coolant in reactor designs.

Text:
New coolants under examination include molten salt eutectics, 
molten sodium, molten lead, or gases.1 Molten sodium, gascooled, and very high temperature reactor (VHTR) 
designs change the cooling medium while maintaining the use of oxide fuel rods or pebble beds, while molten 
salt reactors dissolve fuel salts within the coolant solvent.
