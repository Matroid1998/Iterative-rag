Carbon nanoforms 
combined with biomimetic nanomaterials have driven the 
advancement in nanoscience, biochemistry and materials 
chemistry in the recent years.16, 17 C60 fullerene, since its 
discovery,18 has been of particular interest due to its unique 
chemical and physical properties.1921 The hydrophobic nature 
of the carbon species allows the fullerene to form complexes 
with proteins, leading to biological activity.22, 23 A systematic 
computational analysis suggested the fullerene cage is able to 
scan the protein surface and identify a suitable hydrophobic 
pocket to accommodate.24, 25 Recently, fullerenes were co
crystallised with short helical peptides coordinating the C60 
spheres through a single strategically placed aromatic 
residue,26 showing that the fullerene binding sites can be 
precisely defined.
