Description:
Precious metal used in phosphorescent complexes for applications like OLEDs and bioimaging.

Roomtemperature phosphorescence (RTP) from metalfree or
ganic molecules has been an area of intense research.1 Although clas
sical RTP materials has been used for diverse applications, including 
organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) and bioimaging, they are 
mainly preciousmetal complexes of Ir or Pt.2 Therefore, costeffec
tive, lesstoxic, and sustainable metalfree alternatives are needed. However, intrinsic molecular RTP of metalfree phosphors has not 
rivaled metal complexes. Organic RTP must overcome several challenges stemming from 
the absence of heavymetal atoms. The most severe is the inherently 
small phosphorescence transition probability (i.e., rate constant kp), 
causing poor RTP quantum yields (p).
