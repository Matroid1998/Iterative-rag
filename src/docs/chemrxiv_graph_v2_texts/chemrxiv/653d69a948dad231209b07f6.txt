Methane is the second most common greenhouse gas (GHG), increasing interest in the quan
ti cation and mitigation of anthropogenic methane emissions. Additionally, as a shortlived
28
atmospheric species with a global warming potential (GWP) 86 times that of CO2 over a
20year time horizon, control of methane emissions could produce a substantial reduction in
30
climate forcing.1,2 In the U.S., methane emissions from the oil and gas (OG) supply chain
accounts for approximately one third of anthropogenic methane emissions, 3 with the natural
32
gas production, transport, use and export accounting for the majority of those emissions. Recent legislative initiatives,4,5 and subsequent regulatory moves, have increased interest in
34
accurate assessment of OG methane emissions.

Description:
A component of natural gas involved in exploration, production, and distribution in the supply chain.

Text:
Additionally, OG operators have publicly
committed to report and reduce methane as part of voluntary programs for measurement 6
36
and reporting standards.79
The natural gas supply chain is traditionally divided into several sectors, including ex
38
ploration and production, gas processing, distribution, and midstream transport operations
