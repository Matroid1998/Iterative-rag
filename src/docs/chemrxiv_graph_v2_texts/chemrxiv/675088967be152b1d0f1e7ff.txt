Description:
Interacts only weakly with NaCl(100), making it an ideal microlab to study intermolecular interactions.

Text:
CO on a NaCl(100) surface is a wellknown and longstudied model system for adsorption. However, recent new findings demonstrate that this system is still good for surprises, with
new structures and phenomena emerging. Many of these phenomena are due to the fact that
CO interacts only weakly with NaCl(100), making it an ideal microlab to study intermolec
ular interactions.

Description:
Forms a stable phase with Na at a coverage of 1 ML above 35 K.

Text:
Experimentally it is known that, at a coverage of 1 ML (  1, one CO per surface Na),
a (11) parallelupright (PU) phase with C atoms pointing downward (to Na) is the
most stable phase above 35 K. Below this temperature a p(11) PU p(21) TA phase
transition occurs, with TA denoting a tiltedantiparallel orientation.1 Density functional
theory (DFT) confirmed that indeed, the most stable monolayer phase of CONaCl(100) at
low temperatures is TA.24 PU is favoured at higher T for   1, but also found at low,
submonolayer coverages, even at low T according to theory.

Description:
A molecule with a stretching mode that serves as a sensitive reporter in vibrational spectroscopy.

Text:
For example, at   18, PU
is most stable according to density functional calculations and beyond.4
Such structural details and their changes are typically explored experimentally by vari
ous forms of vibrational spectroscopy, in particular the CO stretching mode being a sensitive
reporter mode.1,5,6 Specifically, at a coverage   1 (1 ML) and T  40 K, where the PU
phase dominates, experimentally a single CO peak at 2155 cm1 was found.

Description:
Molecules that exhibit exciton (Davydov) splitting due to interacting vibrational transition dipole moments in the TA phase.

Text:
At tempera
tures below the p(11) PU p(21) TA transition, a minor peak appears at around 2149
cm1, and the original peak slightly shifts (by 1 cm1) to the red.1 This second peak has
been interpreted as being due to exciton (Davydov) splitting by D 6 cm1, arising from
interacting vibrational transition dipole moments of the CO molecules in the TA phase.7
In another more recent work, Lau et al.8 reported polarized Fourier Transformed Infrared
(FTIR) absorption spectra as a function of coverage between 0.02 and 1.0 ML. They found
