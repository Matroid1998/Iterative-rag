Description:
A compound that can be converted into valuable chemicals and fuels through reduction reactions.

Text:
The electrocatalytic reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)1 and 
carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) have been considered as cornerstone in the 
pursuit of sustainable way of meeting global energy demands.2 These reactions are 
critical for the production of clean energy and recycling of carbon, as they enable the 
conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels and generate hydrogen as a clean 
energy carrier.3 Given the importance of these processes, the development of highly 
efficient and stable catalysts for both CO2RR and HER is of paramount importance.
