Description:
Pharmaceutically active heterocycles.

Text:
Based on the 
transformation of these building blocks, chemists prepared a large number 
of pharmaceutically active heterocycles and carbocycles, including 

isoxazoles,7 
carbazoles,8 
pyridines,9 
furan 
derivatives,10 
pyran 
derivatives,11 lactones,12ab butenolides,12c 9Hpyrrolo1,2a indoles,13 
vinyl fulvenes,14 cyclopentenones,15 and so on.16 We have been interested 
in the synthesis of polycyclic compounds17 and found that Nheterocyclic 
carbene can catalyze double Michaeladditions of active methylene 
compounds with dienones to form cyclohexanone derivatives (Scheme 1, 
eq.1).17eg However, when 1,6diphenylhexa1,5diene3,4dione (cinnamil) 
was used instead of dienone for the reaction, the desired cycloheptane1,2
dione was not formed, and an unexpected tetrahydrocyclopentabfuranol 
was produced as the only product (Scheme 1, eq.2). Herein, we would like 
to report this interesting result.
