Description:
Involved in a competitive mechanism with water adsorption on Pt.

Text:
In the past, several hypothesis have been put forward to explain the pH dependency of 
HER kinetics on Pt.511 It was initially suggested that the stronger PtH binding energy in 
alkaline media, which can be corelated to shifts in the HUPD peaks with pH,7 is the sole reason 
for the slower rate of HER in alkaline electrolytes., However, it was later shown that the 
EMH is an inherent property of a metal, and the variations in HUPD peak positions are due to 
the competitive mechanism between H and water adsorption, where the latter becomes 
weaker at high alkalinity.7,8,11 Alternatively, specific adsorption of cations and their different 
capability in stabilizingdestabilizing OH has also been proposed as the origin of shift in the 
HUPD peaks.12 
In a different work, the binding energy of PtH2O instead of PtH binding energy was 
taken considered to explain the pH dependent HER kinetics of Pt in a highly alkaline 
medium.
