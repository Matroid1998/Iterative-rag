Description:
Highly abundant feedstocks used in multicomponent aminoarylation reactions to form Csp3-C and Csp3-N bonds.

These processes require multistep sequences encompassing highly tailored reaction conditions 
such as cryogenic temperatures andor high pressures as well as precise metalligand 
combinations, which represents a significant limitation and hampers their broad applicability. In sharp contrast, two1720 or oneelectron2127 mediated multicomponent aminoarylation 
reactions featuring alkenes as highly abundant feedstocks represent a powerful, atomeconomic 
alternative to access these ubiquitous motifs as two contiguous Csp3C and Csp3N bonds can 
be forged in a single operation 2834. Despite the intrinsic potential to impart both, relative and 
absolute stereocontrol in the newly formed stereocenters35, asymmetric variants of these 
transformations, especially in intermolecular settings, are extremely scarce. Benzohydroxamic 
acid derivatives18,36 and orthoiodoanilines37 have been showcased as noncleavable C,N
tethered reagents to orchestrate asymmetric annulations with alkenes.
