Description:
Involved in the oxidative coupling process to form the DHHDP group during ellagitannin biosynthesis.

Text:
suggested that the DHHDP group is 
oxidatively 
biosynthesized 
from 
galloyl 
groups 
via 
intramolecular coupling.2 In addition, the DHHDP group can be 
converted into the HHDP group by chemical reduction.2a,3 Our 
group recently reported that the DHHDP group is reductively 
metabolized to the HHDP group in several plants.4 
Furthermore, the DHHDP group can be produced by the CuCl2
mediated oxidation of galloyl ester derivatives in aqueous 
media.5 This strongly indicates that the DHHDP group is the 
initial product of the oxidative coupling of two galloyl groups 
during ellagitannin biosynthesis, and the subsequent reductive 
metabolism yields HHDP esters (Figure 1a).4,5 
Glucose derivatives can adopt various conformations, such 
as chair (C), boat (B), skew or twistboat (S), and envelope (E) 
(Figure S1).6 Many ellagitannins are presumably biosynthesized 
from a common precursor, 1,2,3,4,6pentaOgalloylD
glucose (1) with a 4C1 conformation (Figure 1b).3a,7 For example, 
the glucose moiety of 1Ogalloylpedunculagin (casuarictin) 
with 2,3(S)HHDP and 4,6(S)HHDP groups exhibits the same 
4C1 conformation as 1.7 Oppositely, the glucose moiety of 
geraniin (2) with 3,6(R)HHDP and 2,4(R)DHHDP groups 
exhibits the 1C4 conformation, where all the substituents are in 
the axial orientation.4c,8 In addition, amariin (3) with 2,4(R)
DHHDP 
and 
3,6(R)DHHDP 
groups 
exhibits 
an 
O,3B 
conformation,4c whereas phyllanemblinin B (4) with a 2,4(R)
HHDP group exhibits a 3S1 conformation (Figure 1b).9 However, 
the precise conformations of several ellagitannins, such as 
davidiin (5) with a 1,6(S)HHDP group3a,10 and punicafolin (6) 
with a 3,6(R)HHDP group,11 remain unclear.
