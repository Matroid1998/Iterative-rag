Description:
Organic fluorescent compounds used in optical sensing.

Text:
Optical sensors are widely used in many applications, including in telecommunications, 
environmental monitoring, industrial automation, and medical devices.14 An important class of 
optical sensors uses fluorescent compounds as the basis for their detection mechanism thanks to 
their numerous benefits including high specificity, low detection limits, fast response time, and 
technical simplicity.5 Fluorescent sensors typically work by exhibiting a change in their emission, 
such as fluorescence intensity, emission wavelength or lifetime, in response to interactions with 
specific analytes or environmental changes.6,7 Organic fluorescent compounds such as 
rhodamines,8,9 fluoresceins10, cyanine,11 BODIPY,12,13 and coumarin dyes14 have long been 
used in optical sensing.
