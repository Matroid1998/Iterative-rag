Description:
Ligands with donor properties that influence the stability and reactivity of transition metal complexes.

Text:
Phosphines represent a ubiquitous and extremely important class of ligands in organometallic 
chemistry, and their donor properties greatly affect the coordination, thermodynamic stability, and 
reactivity of transition metal complexes. Phosphines have been shown to significantly modulate the 
reactivity of many organometallic catalyzed reactions, such as hydroformylation,13 crosscoupling,49 and 
hydrogenation.10, 11 To develop new organometallic catalytic reactions where stability and reactivity is 
modulated by phosphines it would be desirable to have extremely fast methods to calculate and explore 
phosphine properties. In this general effort, Gensch, Sigman, and AspuruGuzik recently reported the 
Kraken database that consists of over 300,000 mostly hypothetical phosphine ligands created based on a 
combination of experimentally known phosphines.12 Along with structures, Kraken contains several 
calculated steric and electronic descriptors.
