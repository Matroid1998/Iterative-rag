Description:
Used as ligands in metal complexes and studied for their coordination behavior.

Text:
Thiourea and guanidine derivatives have the general formulae of (NR2)2CS and 
(R2N)2CNR5 respectively.15 They been extensively studied in complex chemistry67 and 
have been proven to have applications as chemical sensors,810 catalysts,8,11 ion 
transporters1314 and several have been studied as anticancer drugs.11,1517 Adjacent to this 
area, thioureas and guanidine as ligands bound to metal complexes have been reported and 
their metalligand coordination behaviour studied; Vijayan et al6 introduced Ruthenium (II) 
complexes containing thiourea derivatives, which showed interesting biological properties, 
particular in anticancer research.6 Bailey and Pace7 synthesised Pt and Ir complexes 
containing guanidine derivatives, illustrating the diversity of metals that can be coordinated 
(both transition and main group) and variations in the nature of the coordination in which 
these guanidine derivatives ligands bind.67,1819 Structurally, both thiourea and guanidine 
ligands have two paralleldisposed NH groups, and as such, some metalcontaining Thiourea 
or Guanidine complexes have been used to study hydrogenbonding with complementary H
bonding partners.20

Description:
A ligand used in complexes studied for photoactivity and H-bonding.

Structure of benzimidazole Thiourea 1 and Guanidine 2 ligands previously used in the 
Blight group.21 
Previous work in our group has centred around the study of Ir (III) guanidine and thiourea 
based complexes as photoactive molecules capable of Hbonding.2122 How the Hbonding 
impacts on the photoactivity of the complexes was also studied along with the strength of the 
binding. Herein, we present several complexes, centred around Rh (III), Co (II) and Pt (II) 
metals. These complexes were characterised using mass spectrometry, CHN combustion
