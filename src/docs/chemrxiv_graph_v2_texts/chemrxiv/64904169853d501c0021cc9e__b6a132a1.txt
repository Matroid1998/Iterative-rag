Description:
A compound that participates in the aldol addition step of the Knoevenagel mechanism.

Text:
The Knoevenagel condensation1 is an important carboncarbon bondforming reaction. The reaction comprises the 
condensation between an aldehyde or a ketone with active hydrogen compounds to yield ,unsaturated 
compounds.2, 3 The mechanism involves two steps i) an aldol addition of an active hydrogen compound to an 
aldehyde or carbonyl compound and ii) 1,2elimination of water or dehydration.46 Usually, the Knoevenagel reaction 
is conducted in solution under homogeneous conditions using weak bases which react with an aldehyde to form the 
hydroxy intermediate.5, 7 Protic and aprotic polar solvents, such as EtOH and DMF, favour the kinetics for the first 
step in the mechanism and aprotic solvents accelerate the reaction in the second step.
