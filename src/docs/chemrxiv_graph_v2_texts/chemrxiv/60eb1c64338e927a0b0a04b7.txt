Description:
A chalcogen that can form part of crystalline inorganic-organic hybrid materials.

Text:
IIVI layered hybrids (LHs) are a class of crystalline inorganicorganic hybrid materials 
with the general formula (MQ)L, where M  Zn, Mn, or Cd, Q  S, Se, or Te, and L is 
typically a primary aliphatic amine.13 Each hybrid layer, which contains an inorganic slab 
capped by organic ligands, is associated with neighbouring layers only by van der Waals 
forces.
