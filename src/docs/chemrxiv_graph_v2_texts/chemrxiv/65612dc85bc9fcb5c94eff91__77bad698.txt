Description:
A compound used in the modification of low-cost polymers with elemental sulfur.

Text:
To realize these benefits, 
readily accessible polymers that respond to such lowpower irradiation are required. Addressing these needs, this study describes the modification of lowcost polymers made 
from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene using low power 
continuous wave lasers with wavelengths of 532, 638, 690, and 786 nm. Polymers made from 
elemental sulfur have received increasing attention with the advent of inverse vulcanization8 
and related polymerization methods912 that convert this abundant and inexpensive feedstock 
into functional polysulfide materials.

The high sulfur content of these intriguing polymers 
imparts a variety of chemical, physical, and optical properties that enable diverse applications 
in energy storage,8, 13, 14 thermal imaging optics,1518 and metal binding.1921 Additionally, the S
S bonds in these polymers can be broken and reformed, which enables repair and recycling.2224 
It is the lability of the SS bonds in these sulfur copolymers that led to the discoveries 
detailed in this report. Specifically, it was found that the surface of a copolymer made from 
sulfur and cyclopentadiene was visibly altered after an exposure of less than 1 second to a 690 
nm, 1.10 mW diode laser. Given the low power of the laser and brief exposure times, this rapid 
polymer modification was a surprise.
