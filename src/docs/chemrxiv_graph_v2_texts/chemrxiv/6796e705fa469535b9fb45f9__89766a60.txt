Description:
Silylboronic esters act as nucleophiles to terminate the catalytic cycle in reactions.

Text:
In this 
field, coppercatalyzed asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted allenes (or alkynes) has been 
achieved in the coupling of diazoalkanes (or hydrazones) with terminal alkynes where the 
protonation process closures the reaction (Scheme 1a, top).4 Besides, terminal alkynes 
and silylboronic esters as nucleophiles are envisaged to terminate the catalytic cycle, thus 
two carboncarbon bonds can be constructed in an enantioselective threecomponent 
reaction manner (Scheme 1a, bottom).5 In addition, the aforementioned stereoenriched 
metal species also demonstrated its utility in the assembly of axial and inherent chirality 
whether through a H or heteroatom elimination pathway.
