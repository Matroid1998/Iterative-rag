Description:
Short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbes and utilized by enterocytes.

Text:
The human gut microbiome has emerged as a powerful de
terminant of host health and has been associated with several 
important comorbidity factors and disease states including 
obesity, metabolic syndrome, bowel cancer, and neurodegen
erative disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons dis
ease.1 As key players in the human large intestinal environ
ment, the interplay between the gut microbiota, intestinal mu
cosa and colonocytes has been shown to play an important role 
in modulating host immunity and conferring resistance to in
fection.24 
Previous works have demonstrated enterocytes utilisation 
of shortchain fatty acid (SCFAs) produced by gut microbes.5
7 However, large gaps remain in our understanding of the 
multidirectional interplay between colonocytes, the mucosa 
and commensal bacteria, largely due to the lack of high
throughput models and methods able to study these processes 
at a molecular level while also reproducing key physiological 
traits of the human large intestine.5 Currently existing tech
niques for probing the exchange between colonocytes and gut 
microbial species largely rely on specialist equipment and co
culture methods that can be difficult to set up.
