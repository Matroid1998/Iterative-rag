Description:
Promotes dinitrogen activation and reduction.

Text:
The preparation and reactivity of lowvalent molybdenum 
compounds (III and lower) has been comparatively 
underexplored, despite promising activities in a multitude of 
reductive transformations. Pioneering studies demonstrated the 
ability of tris(amide) supported Mo(III) complexes to promote 
dinitrogen activation and reduction.17,18 Pincer ligands were 
most widely employed for stabilizing lowvalent oxidation 
states of Mo and the corresponding complexes were exploited 
as catalysts for hydrogenation of alkynes19 and nitriles,20 
dinitrogen reduction,2123 olefin isomerization,24 and CO2 
reduction, 25,26 among others. In the context of reactivity with 
CO2, dianionic molybdenum carbonyl (M2Mo(CO)6 (M  Li, 
Na, K)) as well as phosphinesupported complexes (e.g.
