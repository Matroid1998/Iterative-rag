Description:
Undergoes catalytic conversion into glycidol in water.

To the 
best of our knowledge, the incorporation of titanium in 
such precursor material and its further crystallization 
into fully functional hierarchical TS1 catalyst by SAC 
has never been reported. We aim to demonstrate that 
controlling the incorporation of titanium during the 
preparation of the precursor particles prior to the 
thermal treatment allows obtaining TS1 presenting 
both proper Ti speciation in the MFItype structure and 
a 
secondary 
intracrystalline 
macroporosity. The 
successful conversion of the amorphous material into 
crystalline TS1 is exploited in the catalytic conversion 
of allyl alcohol into glycidol in water, and compared to 
the benchmark microporous TS1 catalyst. 2. Experimental
