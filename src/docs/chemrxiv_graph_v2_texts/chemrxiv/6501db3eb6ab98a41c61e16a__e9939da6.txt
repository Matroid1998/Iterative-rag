Description:
A surface used for CO2 methanation in microkinetic models.

Text:
RMG is a wellestablished tool to construct gasphase mechanisms for complex systems, e.g.,
the pyrolysis of jet fuel.10 Functionalities for heterogeneous catalysts, in contrast, have been
added relatively recently.11 Previous studies on the catalysis branch of RMG have focused on
expanding the thermophysical adsorbate database,12,13 improving kinetics databases and rate
rules of surface reaction families,13,14 and developing important features such as linear scaling
relations.15 With these advancements, RMG has successfully generated microkinetic models
for CO2 methanation on Ni(111)14,16,17 and oxidation of light hydrocarbons.12,13,15 It was
also possible to include rigorous quantification of correlated uncertainties in the generation
