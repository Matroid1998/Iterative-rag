Description:
Used in peptide chemistry for isosteric replacement with SO2.

Text:
The scientific introduction of the term isostere by Langmuir in 1919 1 and its application to 
biological activity by Friedman in 1951 2 is one of the cornerstone concepts in modern MedChem 
3. Despite the seeming simplicity of the concept, its practical using sometimes seriously limited by 
synthetic accessibility of corresponding speculatively generated isosterestructures. As an example 
of the statement the benzene isosteres story could be highlighted 4. Therefore, the generating of 
isosteric structures, which could be easily obtained by the changing of readily accessible starting 
materials using the general approach to parent structure is promising for modern MedChem. For 
example, the isosteric replacement of CO with SO2 was widely used in peptide chemistry via 
exchanging of the corresponding amino acids to sulpha analogues 5,6.
