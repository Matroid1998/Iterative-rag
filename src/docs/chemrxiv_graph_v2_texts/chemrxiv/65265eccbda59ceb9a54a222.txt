Description:
Referenced in the context of 13C NMR spectroscopy for structure elucidation.

Understanding and characterizing molecular structures is a 
fundamental task in chemistry, with applications spanning across drug 
design, synthetic chemistry, and material science. Characterizing 
complex organic compounds, particularly distinguishing regio and 
stereoisomers, remains challenging and often demands a blend of 
sophisticated analytical techniques. One powerful tool to navigate this 
complexity is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Structure elucidation often requires data from several sources. For 
example, combining a 1D NMR technique such as a proton (1H) or 
carbon (13C) spectrum and 2D methods like Heteronuclear Single 
Quantum Coherence (HSQC) orand Heteronuclear Multiple Bond 
Correlation (HMBC) can be beneficial.1 However, practical limitations 
such as overlapping peaks, impurities, or product mixtures can 
introduce sources of error rendering the elucidation of the correct 
structure a highly challenging task.
