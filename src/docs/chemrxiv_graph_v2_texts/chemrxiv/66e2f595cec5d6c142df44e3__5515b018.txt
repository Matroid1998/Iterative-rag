Description:
Catalysts that can benefit from cation substitution for improved oxygen evolution reaction and alcohol oxidation.

Text:
These include steps, edges, dislocations as well
as the chemical modification of catalysts via the creation
of oxygen vacancies or cations substitution.812
Cation substitution in Co3O4 catalysts has been
found, in favorable cases, benficial for oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) and alcohol oxidation. It can lower the
binding energy of water molecules and intermediates
onto active sites, increase the electrical conductivity
by promoting charge transfer among the heteroatoms
and consequently improve the OER performance10. In Ref.12 the authors used cation doping and oxygen
vacancies to engineer the electronic states of ultrathin
Co3O4 (001) nanosheets for OER.

Description:
A nanocatalyst with coordinatively unsaturated metal cations used as a reactivity descriptor for transition metal oxide catalysts towards OER.

Text:
In a recent study, considering Co3O4, Fe2O3, MnO2
and TiO2
nanocatalysts,
coordinatively unsaturated
metal cations were found to be a good reactivity
descriptor for transition metal oxide (TMO) cataysts
towards OER.11 This was attributed to the fact that the
surface reactivity was found to increase monotonically
with their density. In the model suggested by the
authors, the energy of the highest occupied dstates
relative to the Fermi level could be used to describe
the intermediatesurface bonding strength. This has
triggered numerous studies devoted to extend the model
to other TMO and adsorbate molecules and therefore
elucidate the relationship between the electronic struc
ture of metal cation active regions and the reactivity.
