Used as a low valent metal in photocatalytic processes with no stoichiometric metal waste.

Owing to their ubiquity, the activation of CH bonds at sp3 carbon centers represents a continuous 
challenge with great interest in organic synthesis.1,2 Over the years, a wealth of methods for their 
activation in various positions has been developed, the majority of which relies on transition metal 
catalysis.37 Recently, photocatalysis has proven to be a valuable tool for CH functionalization as well, 
offering novel approaches via singleelectron transfer (SET) and hydrogen atom transfer mechanisms 
(HAT), in some cases including the aid of a metal catalyst.823 
While photocatalysis is most commonly known for radical reactivity,18,19 carbanion or carbocation 
species can be generated via a radicalpolar crossover as well.2429 In particular, the formation of 
carbanion28,29 intermediates in a photocatalytic and redox neutral fashion offers several advantages 
compared to traditional methods,30,31 such as full atom economy, no stoichiometric amount of metal 
waste (low valent Mg, Zn, or Li metals), and high functional group tolerance (limitation of classical 
methods; Fig.
