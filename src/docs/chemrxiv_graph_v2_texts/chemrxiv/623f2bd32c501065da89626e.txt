Description:
Used in pincer ligated metal complexes for catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles at high temperatures.

Text:
reported the catalytic acceptorless 
dehydrogenation of Nheterocycles by Fe and Co pincer ligated metal complexes at high
temperatures.7 Further, metalfree dehydrogenation of Nheterocycles was achieved by borane
based catalysts.8 Photocatalytic dehydrogenation typically uses cobaloxime complexes for H2 
release.9 Sorensen, Li and Huang, reported the dehydrogenation of aliphatic and N
heterocycles (Fig. 1b) using a combination of a photoredox catalysts, such as the decatungstate 
anion, Ru(bpy)3Cl26H2O, or 2chloroanthraquinone, with a cobaloxime complex.10 While the 
reaction is of perfect atom economy, the product yield was low and the scope of starting 
materials limited. The photochemical dehydrogenation of Nheterocycles was achieved by a 
combination of acridinium salt and transition metal catalysts, but gave arenes rather than 
alkenes (Fig. 1c).11
