The interface between metal surfaces and solutions presents a complex chemical environment. 31 
Interfacial regions are often increasingly reactive compared to bulk solutions facilitating catalytic 
32 
reactions. Additionally, molecules or ions can adsorb onto the metal surface, thereby altering the 
33 
concentration of species in both the solution and on the metal surface and altering the energetics 
34 
and kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions at the electrodeelectrolyte interface. In aqueous 
35 
solutions, water often serves as both a reactant and a solvent, influencing reactions such as the 
36 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction, and the CO2 reduction reaction. (1

3) Understanding the role of interfacial water structure is essential for advancing the understanding 
38 
of electrocatalytic processes in aqueous media. 39
