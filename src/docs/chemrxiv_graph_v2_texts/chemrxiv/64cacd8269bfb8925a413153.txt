Description:
Building blocks used in radical disconnection strategies.

Alternatively, a C(sp2) electrophile in the presence 
of an exogenous can be used in a crosselectrophile coupling.21 
In contrast, following a radical disconnection leads the practi
tioner to building blocks such as carboxylic acids and alkyl 
esters pioneered by Baran and MacMillan as well as alkyl hal
ides popularized by Weix, Gong, and Molander.1820 While the 
emergence of radicalbased cross couplings has expanded the 
range of chemical space accessible in the synthesis of fine 
chemicals, there yet lie limitations. Whether following a polar 
or radical disconnection, the use of thermally driven cross
couplings relies on the energy needed for the reaction being a 
core component of the starting materials.
