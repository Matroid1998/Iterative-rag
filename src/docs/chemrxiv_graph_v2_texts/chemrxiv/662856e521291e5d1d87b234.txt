Description:
Monodentate ligands characterized by electronic and steric properties.

To streamline 
this process, various electronic and steric parameters which 
describe inherent properties of ligands have been intro
duced, and correlation between these parameters and out
comes of the reaction have been investigated (Figure 1a, 
left).36 For historical example, Tolman and coworkers have 
conducted a pioneering work in this field, where Tolmans 
electronic parameter (CO) and the cone angle () were in
troduced as metrics for electronic and steric properties of 
monodentate phosphorous(III) ligands.3 They revealed that, 
by plotting a measurable function F (i.e., reaction yield) 
against these parameters (socalled Tolmans plot), the 
electronic and steric characters of the reaction, which are 
used as the guidelines for designing optimal ligands, can be 
understood as the slope of the function with respect to each 
parameter (FCO and F).
