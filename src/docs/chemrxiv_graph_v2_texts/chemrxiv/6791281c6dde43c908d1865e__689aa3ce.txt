Description:
Used in solid-state batteries as a potential alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance and cost-effectiveness.

Text:
Lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been successfully applied in electric vehicles, portable devices, and 
energy storage solutions.13 However, safety concerns, the scarcity of lithium resources, and the 
resulting fluctuating prices remain the Achilles heel of LIBs.4 Sodium solidstate batteries (SSBs) have 
attracted enormous attention and are regarded as a potential alternative to LIBs. Ideally, sodium SSBs 
offer reduced costs due to the abundance of sodium on Earth and improved safety because of the use 
of inflammable solidstate components.5 One of the perspectives of sodium SSBs is applying them in 
largescale energy storage systems owing to their excellent costeffectiveness and to the similar 
manufacturing process to LIBs.6,7 The key component that significantly impacts solidstate batteries 
properties and performance is the solidstate electrolyte (SE).
