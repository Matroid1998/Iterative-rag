Description:
Compounds whose triple bonds are transformed by low-valence tantalum complexes.

Text:
It is known that tantalum compounds can be useful for the 
synthesis of various classes of organic compounds. The TaCl5Mg 
reagent system is an effective tool for the reduction of non
functionalized alkynes and 1alkynyl sulfones to the corresponding 
olefins 1. Recently, we have developed a regio and 
stereoselective method for the synthesis of substituted 3alkenyl 
amines and 4alkynylols based on the reduction of alkynyl amines 
and alcohols using a similar reagent system NbCl5Mg 2. The 
possibility of creating a new carboncarbon bond was demonstrated 
by the example of the TaCl5catalyzed carbomagnesiation reaction 
of 1alkenes with nalkyl Grignard reagents 35. Thus, lowvalence 
tantalum complexes are effective reagents for the transformation 
of the triple bond of various acetylenic compounds. The closest 
electronic analogue of the tantalum atom is niobium.
