Description:
Novel conjugated polycyclic molecules of interest.

Text:
In this respect, 
there is a great interest in the development of no
vel conjugated polycyclic molecules such as ac
enes,2 phenacenes,3 or nanographenes.4 Cor
responding heteroacenes, which contain hetero
atoms such as nitrogen or sulfur represent encou
raging alternatives to the pure hydrocarbons, be
cause electronic properties are tunable and che
mical stability is typically increased.5,6 
One of the most prominent example is represen
ted by benzo1,2b4,5bdithiophene 1, which 
was very successfully implemented as synthon in 
a multitude of oligomeric7 and polymeric materi
als8 for efficient organic solar cells.
