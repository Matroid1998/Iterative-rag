Description:
A homonuclear diatomic molecule whose dissociation involves a delicate interplay between weak and strong correlation.

Text:
For example, upon dissociation of H2, DM21 gets the region around equilibrium right (weak
correlation) as well as the dissociation limit (strong correlation) as it has been trained on
its dissociation limit.13 However, describing homonuclear diatomics at intermediate bond
distances (e.g., about 3 for H2) can be even more challenging than the dissociation limit
due to the delicate interplay between weak (dynamical) and strong (static) correlation.14 For
the intermediate distances, DM21 displays a large unphysical bump in the H2 dissociation
curve.13 This deciency of DM21 can be xed by symmetry breaking or fractional KS occu
pations, but the two approaches would also x e.g., B3LYPs H2 dissociation curves.15,16 The
challenge is thus to build an XC approximation capturing strong correlation in the standard
