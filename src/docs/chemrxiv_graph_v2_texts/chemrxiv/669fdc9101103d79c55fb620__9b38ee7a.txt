Description:
An organometallic compound with a sandwich structure and central iron atom, known for its redox chemistry and exceptional chemical stability.

For instance, in response to 
inflammation, iron levels are reduced to restrict its availability to 
pathogens, but it can also impair immune cell function by restrict
ing their iron supply.1214 Artificial systems that mimic these 
functions or exert spatiotemporal control over iron levels are 
consequently attractive in the context of potential biomedical 
applications. Ferrocene (Fc) with its captivating sandwich structure with a 
central iron atom represents one of the most studied organometal
lic compounds since its discovery in the early 1950s.15 Its popu
larity can be attributed to a unique combination of its redox chem
istry, structural fluxionality, and exceptional chemical and photo
chemical stability that parallels that of aromatic compounds.
