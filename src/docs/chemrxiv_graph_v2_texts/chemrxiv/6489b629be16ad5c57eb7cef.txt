Description:
A pseudooctahedral heteroleptic complex with a modular framework.

Text:
In this work, we focus on pseudooctahedral heteroleptic facIr(CN)2(NN) 
complexes (where CN is the cyclometalating ligand and NN is the ancillary ligand, see 
Figure 1) because of their modular framework and abundant experimental data availability.18,19 
In total, we have chosen a set of 30 Ir(III) complexes with structurally diverse chemical motifs 
in both cyclometalating and ancillary ligands (see Table S8 in the SI). We chose different 
cyclometalating ligands including 2phenylpyridine (ppy), 1phenylpyrazole (phpz), 2
phenylbenzoxazole (PBO) and 2phenylbenzothiazole (pbt) and different ancillary ligands 
including 2,2bipyridine (bpy) and 1,10phenanthroline (phen). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023cwxxnv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000217778578 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
