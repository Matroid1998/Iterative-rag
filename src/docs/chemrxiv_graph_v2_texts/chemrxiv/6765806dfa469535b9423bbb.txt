Description:
Used in selective deposition for tone inversion and resist hardening in ASALD processes.

2.c,d).8 In 2021, TSMC demonstrated the use of 
ASALD to achieve such a via with the goal of interconnect expansion beyond 3 nm nodes.12 As 
a different target application, the possibility to deposit material in complex 3D structures is 
providing opportunities for ASALD, e.g., in modern memory devices.15 
Beyond microelectronic technology, (AS)ALD is used in fields like catalysis, solar cells or battery 
research.9,1621 Furthermore, ASALD has been combined with topdown patterning approaches, 
e.g. in the case of TiO2 where the selective deposition is used for tone inversion and resist 
hardening.22 The major challenge in ASALD is achieving (near)perfect selectivity for a high 
number of ALD cycles.
