Description:
A group used for surface anchoring of molecular catalysts through hydrophobic interactions.

Text:
Such 
assemblies allow for the surface anchoring of molecular catalysts 
equipped with suitable binding units, such as naphthalene or 
adamantane groups.12 The anchoring of these catalysts through 
hydrophobic 
interactions 
enables 
their 
utilisation 
in 
electrochemical catalysis while maintaining their ability to be 
replaced with fresh catalyst molecules upon degradation.13 
Surfacebound metal complexes have been shown to retain the 
high specific activity and selectivity of molecular species while 
also benefiting from inherent advantages of heterogeneous 
electrocatalysts including increased stability and reduced catalyst 
loading requirements.1416 Furthermore, immobilised catalysts 
allow for reactions to be conducted in aqueous media, even when 
the catalyst itself is hydrophobic. This eliminates certain 
constraints in catalyst design, particularly by enabling the ligand 
sphere of a metal complex to be tuned to a specific reaction 
without solubility restrictions.
