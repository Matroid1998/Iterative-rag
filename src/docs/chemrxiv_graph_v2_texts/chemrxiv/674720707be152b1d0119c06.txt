Description:
A heavy metal with high atomic weight and density, used in various industrial applications.

Text:
Heavy metals are natural elements that have high atomic weight and a density at least five times greater 
than that of water. Some examples of heavy metals are mercury (Hg), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), lead 
(Pb), arsenic (As), etc. Heavy metals have multiple industrial, domestic, medical, and technological 
applications, such as in batteries, paints, pesticides, fertilizers, cosmetics, drugs, and alloys1. However, 
their widespread use and disposal have also led to their accumulation and contamination in the 
environment, especially in soil, water, and food sources2. Heavy metal contamination poses a serious 
threat to human health and the ecosystem, as heavy metals are nonbiodegradable and highly toxic at 
certain levels.

Description:
A heavy metal that can bind to thiol groups, affecting enzyme structure and function.

Text:
We chose selenium oxide 
nanoparticles as the nanomaterial for our biosensor because of their high binding affinity with heavy 
metals such as mercury, which facilitates the detection process16. We also chose protease enzyme as 
the biorecognition element for our biosensor because of its wide availability and low cost. Protease 
enzyme is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins17. Heavy metals can 
affect the structure and function of protease enzyme by binding to its thiol groups or other active sites, 
which results in changes in its catalytic activity and heat production18,19.In pursuit of sustainability and 
costeffectiveness, we innovatively synthesized a crude protease enzyme extracted from chicken 
intestine.
