Nowadays, the production of new materials is closely related to the reverse 
logistics, considered one of most important instruments for applying shared 
responsibility for the products lifecycle. Reverse logistics is an instrument of economic 
and social development characterized by a set of actions, procedures and means to 
enable the collection and restitution of solid waste to the business sector, for reuse, in its 
cycle or in other cycles productive, or other environmentally appropriate final 
destination (Tibben and Lembke, 2002), the reverse logistic is perfectly applied in the 
agriculture context. An application of this concept is to provide novel processes for the 
synthesis of different calcium and  or potassium phosphates from any source of calcium 
carbonate (CaCO3), making it a soil conditioner.
