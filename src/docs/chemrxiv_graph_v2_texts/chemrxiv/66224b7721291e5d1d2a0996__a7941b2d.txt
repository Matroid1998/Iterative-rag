Description:
Used as an electrophile in metallaphotoredox catalyzed reactions to synthesize carboxylic acids.

Text:
Although significant 
progresses have been achieved in this realm, metallaphotoredox catalyzed reactions employing CO2 as 
one of the electrophiles to synthesize carboxylic acids via CC bond formation,4 especially in an 
enantioselective manner, remains in its infancy (Figure 1a). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024s9wwt ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000285486286 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
