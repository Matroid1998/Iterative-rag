Description:
Fatty acid methyl esters used for quantitative analysis with flame ionisation detection and molecular characterisation with mass spectrometry.

Text:
When coupled with flame ionisation 
detection (FID) this approach can be used for quantitative analysis 
where response factors for individual FAMEs are approximately 
equivalent. Coupling of GC with mass spectrometry (GCMS) 
allows the molecular characterisation of the separated FAMEs 
using their fingerprint mass spectra and relative retention times 
(Farkas et al., 2008). Liquid chromatographic (LC) techniques with
