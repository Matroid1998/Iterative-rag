Description:
A reactive intermediate formed during intramolecular acyl group transfer.

Text:
DSH activated 
thioesters, such as acylCoAs, through the dynamic thiolthioe
ster exchange and intramolecular acyl group transfer, forming a 
reactive acyl pyridinium intermediate (Figure S1).10 The cata
lyst bound to the acidic patch of nucleosomes via LANA, and 
efficiently promoted H2BK120 (the 120th Lys of H2B)selec
tive acylation in living cells in the presence of cell permeable 
acetyl thioesters (NACAc) as acetyl donors.12 Quantification 
of acetylation yield of recombinant nucleosomes acetylated by 
PEGLANADSSMe showed that H2BK120 was acetylated in 
80, and a proximate H2BK116 residue was also acetylated 
in 10 yield.12 Other Lys residues in a nucleosome were rarely 
acetylated (5 yield).

Description:
An intermediate that reacts with nearby Lys residues.

Text:
The acyl pyridinium intermediate derived from DSH reacted 
only with nearby Lys residues.8 The molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation indicates that the distance between the acyl carbon 
atom of the acyl pyridinium intermediate and the Nterminal
