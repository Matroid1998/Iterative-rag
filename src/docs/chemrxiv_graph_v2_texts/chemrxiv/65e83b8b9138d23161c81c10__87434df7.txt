Organosilicon compounds play a crucial role in organic 
synthesis, serving as synthetic reagents, intermediates, pro
tecting groups, and valuable bioisosteres of carbon.18 
Among these compounds, allyl silanes encompass the prop
erties of alkenes and organometallic complexes, making 
them widely used in organic synthesis.912 Notably, the well
known silicon effect,11,13 which manifests itself in the se
lective electrophilic substitution of alkenes, is particularly 
pronounced in the reactivity of allyl silanes. This effect not 
only enhances the activity and nucleophilicity of alkenes, es
pecially the alkenyl carbons distal to the silyl group, but also 
effectively controls the regioselectivity through (CSi) 
hyperconjugation.
