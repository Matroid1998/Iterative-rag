Description:
Used in the treatment of Sb2Se3 to suppress non-radiative recombination pathways and improve photovoltage.

Text:
Furthermore, we demonstrate increased radiative recombination efficiency by suppression of non
radiative recombination pathways in sulfurtreated Sb2Se3 using PL spectroscopy. In addition to 
this, low frequency Raman spectroscopy (LFRS) showed increased longrange order in the Sb2Se3 
semiconductor thin films upon sulfur treatment. These results explain the improved photovoltage 
of Sb2Se3 upon sulfur treatment, which presents a simple and efficient defect passivation strategy.
