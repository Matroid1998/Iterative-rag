Description:
React with amines in direct amidation reactions to form amides.

Text:
The direct amidation reaction between carboxylic acids and amines is one of the most common processes 
employed in the synthesis of organic molecules in both academic and industrial organisations. It remains a 
highly inefficient reaction, however, due to the widespread use of stoichiometric activating agents that leads 
to the generation of high molecular weight byproducts as well as increased solvent use during both workup 
and purification.1 There has consequently been considerable interest in recent years in the development of 
catalytic direct amidation reactions which enable amides to be produced from carboxylic acids and amines 
with a molecule of water as the only stoichiometric byproduct.

Description:
Polar functionalized compounds that are not effectively solubilized by relatively nonpolar solvents.

For larger scale reactions, DeanStark water removal is employed as this is considerably more 
efficient in terms of solvent usage and scalability, and there are a few reports of direct amidation reactions 
catalysed by boric acid or simple boronic acids being employed on an industrial scale.7 The solvents used for 
catalytic amidation reactions are typically aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene,2a,3a fluorobenzene2b), chlorinated 
solvents (1,2dichloroethane2i) or ethers (Et2O,5d THF,4a4b CPME,3e TAME3g3h), and these are often sub
optimal from a safety andor sustainability perspective.8 In addition, these relatively nonpolar solvents do 
not effectively solubilise many polar functionalised carboxylic acids or amines.
