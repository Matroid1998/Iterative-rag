Description:
One of the most abundant functional groups with several efficient conversion reactions reported.

Text:
The development of efficient transformations of abundant 
functional groups has been a central topic in synthetic or
ganic chemistry. For example, among the numerous CC 
bond formations, transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling 
reactions are generally the most reliable and indispensable.1 
On the one hand, these crosscoupling reactions generally re
quire the use of halogenated substrates and a twostep pro
cess involving a halogenation step and CC bond formation. Hydroxyl group is one of the most abundant functional 
groups, and several efficient conversion reactions have re
cently been reported (Figure 1A).2 In 2018 and 2022, Suga, 
Ukaji et al. reported direct conversion reactions of alcohols 
using Tireagents.3 This reaction is applicable to primary to 
tertiary alcohols and proved to be useful because it can be 
used for aliphatic alcohols.
