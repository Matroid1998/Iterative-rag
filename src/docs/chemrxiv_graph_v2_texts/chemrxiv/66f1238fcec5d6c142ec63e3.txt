Description:
Catalytic activity is governed by chemical composition and structural features like channel shape and pore volume.

Zeolite ZSM5 stands out as one
of the most extensively used zeolites in the petrochemical industry,
where it can serve as an efficient catalyst for hydrocarbon trans
formations.1,2 The catalytic activity of zeolites is primarily gov
erned by their chemical composition, with structural features such
as channel shape, accessible pore volume, and the positioning of
aluminium atoms within the framework significantly influencing
their catalytic behaviour.24
Accurately determining the position of aluminium atoms within
the zeolite framework is useful for understanding and optimizing
catalytic properties.2,4 However, traditional techniques like Xray
crystallography have inadequate sensitivity for distinguishing be
tween aluminium and silicon atoms and thus it cannot be used for
the determination of the aluminium siting.

magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, particularly 27Al NMR,
has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the local environments
of aluminium atoms in zeolites.57 Several studies have attempted
to correlate experimental 27Al NMR spectra with specific Tsites in
the zeolite framework.813 However, sizable inconsistencies in the
calculated chemical shifts reported in these studies illustrate the
continuing challenges faced by researchers in this field. Interpreting solidstate NMR spectra can be challenging due to
signal broadening and overlap.

Description:
Materials with large unit cells that often require simplifications in computational models due to their complexity.

Text:
Theoretical calculations of NMR
parameters, including those derived from firstprinciples meth
ods, can provide valuable insights.5,10,1317 However, the compu
tational demands of these methods, especially for the large unit
cells typical of zeolites, often require adoption of various simpli
fications, such as disregarding water molecules andor charge
compensating cations in the models, or representing the system
using a single structure (putative global minimum) forgoing the
dynamical temperature effects.9,10
Machine learning (ML) methods offer a promising alternative
to firstprinciples methods by significantly accelerating either the
structure sampling via machine learning potentials1823 or the
property predictions.2426 In particular, various ML methods have
been tested and adopted for the prediction of NMRrelated prop
erties with regression techniques such as least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator regression, kernel ridge regression, and
