Driven by the unique benefits of inherent safety, low cost, electrochemical stability, high ionic 
conductivity and environmental friendliness, superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes are 
receiving great interest in defining new chemistries for batteries 1. Although conventional lithium
ion batteries (LIBs) employing organic electrolytes have reached an acceptable performance limit, 
they still suffer of serious issues, such as safety and cost. The nonaqueous organic carbonate 
electrolytes used in conventional Liion batteries, indeed, have low flashpoints, high melting points 
and high viscosities rendering them useless at lower temperatures 2. Moreover, conventional Li
ion batteries mostly rely on thermally unstable LiPF6 which, in the presence of moisture, can
