Description:
A photoswitchable chromophore in phytochromes that absorbs red light.

Text:
Phytochromes are lightsensing biological machines, ubiquitous in plants, fungi and bacte
ria.111 They are redabsorbing homodimeric proteins, carrying a photoswitchable bilin as
a chromophore. Most phytochromes exist in two distinct photoreversible forms the red
lightabsorbing form, also known as Pr state, and the farred light absorbing form, the Pfr
state,9,1215 which differ by both chromophore stereochemistry and protein structure. Phytochromes of different species share a generally conserved photosensory module (PSM,
Fig. 1), composed by three domains PAS (PerArndtSim), GAF (cGMP phosphodiesteraseadenyl
cyclaseFhlA) and PHY (Phytochrome specific).
