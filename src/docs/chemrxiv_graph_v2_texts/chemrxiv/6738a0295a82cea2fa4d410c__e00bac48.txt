Description:
Undergoes pyrolysis and steam reforming of natural gas to produce hydrogen.

Text:
The dissociation of hydrogen storage materials, photocatalytic water splitting, 
photoelectrochemical electrolysis, methane pyrolysis, steam reforming of natural gas and photo reforming 
of biomass are important processes for generating hydrogen 914. The water oxidation half reaction of 
overall water splitting is sluggish, energetically demanding and often handled by improving the 
performance of photocatalysts including the inclusion of cocatalysts, elemental doping, Zscheme 
arrangements, morphological control, and the quantum confinement effect 1518.
