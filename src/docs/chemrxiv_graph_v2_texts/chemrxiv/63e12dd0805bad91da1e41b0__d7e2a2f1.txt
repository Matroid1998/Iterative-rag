Description:
A molecule involved in reduction reactions, often requiring catalysts to bind and extract protons in aqueous electrolytes.

To this end, most efforts in molecular CO2R have 
been directed in either using the catalysts in homogeneous form, dissolved in an electrolyte, or 
heterogenized onto an electrode surface.9,10 In aqueous electrolytes which are practical for CO2R, 
excessive hydrophobicity often precluded certain catalysts from being applied for CO2R as this 
prevented their dissolution for homogeneous applications or their capacity to effectively bind 
dissolved CO2 and extract protons from water when they were heterogenized.
