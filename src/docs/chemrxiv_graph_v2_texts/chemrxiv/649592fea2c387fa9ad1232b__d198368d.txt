Description:
A class of low valent main group compounds applied in small molecule activation.

Text:
Lowvalent main group compounds have long been considered as lab curiosities of limited 
stability and accessibility. However, research endeavors in the past three decades have 
changed this assumption and impressively demonstrated that species with most unusual 
bonding situations and electronic structures can be isolated and most importantly be applied 
in the activation of small molecules and strong bonds.1 This has sparked interest in applying 
such compounds also in catalysis, with the prospect of developing sustainable, transition metal 
free alternatives to existing protocols. One of the most researched classes of low valent main 
group compounds applied in small molecule activation are carbenes and their heavier 
congeners, RER (E  CPb).2 This interest was particularly fueled by the landmark report 
by Bertrand and coworkers in 2007 showing that alkyl(amino)carbenes (e.g.
