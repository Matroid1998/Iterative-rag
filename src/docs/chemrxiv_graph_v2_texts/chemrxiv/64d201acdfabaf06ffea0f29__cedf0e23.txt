Description:
Forms open-shell radical intermediates from native C(sp3)H bonds.

C(sp3)H functionalization plays an increasingly important 
role in the diversification of fine chemicals, providing atom and 
stepeconomic methods to modify complex molecules in a late
stage fashion.1 Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) represents a 
particularly appealing approach for C(sp3)H functionalization, 
enabling the smooth generation of openshell alkyl radical 
intermediates from native C(sp3)H bonds, which readily undergo 
subsequent transformations. Recently, the merger of HAT and 
photocatalysis has been extensively exploited to forge CC, CB, 
CO, CN, CX (halogen), or CS bonds from C(sp3)H bonds.2,3 
Organophosphorus compounds have found wide applications in 
organocatalysis,4a medicinal chemistry,4b and material science.4c 
The construction of organophosphorus compounds through HAT
induced CP bond formation directly from readily available 
alkanes is stepeconomic and can significantly broaden skeletal 
diversity 
of 
synthetically 
accessible 
organophosphorus 
compounds.
