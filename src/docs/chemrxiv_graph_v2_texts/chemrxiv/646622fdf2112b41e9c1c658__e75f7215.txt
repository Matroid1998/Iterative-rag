diisopropylphenyl) (Figure 1).2 Since this initial discovery, Mg(I) dimers have been used as 
bespoke reducing agents towards an array of organic and inorganic substrates.37 Mg(I) dimers 
are usually obtained via reduction of heteroleptic Mg(II) halide precursors with alkali 
metals.8,9 However, extension of this methodology to isolate the heavier congeners (i.e. Ca
Ba) has not been successful, largely due to the instability of AEAE interactions.1012 The
