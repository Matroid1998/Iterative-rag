Description:
An element with high content in lignin, contributing to its thermal stability and biodegradability.

Lignin is a plant based polyphenol that allows trees to have a strong structure 
and protection against pests and microorganisms.13 Considering its inherent attractive 
properties such as high carbon content ( 60 atom) and thermal stability, biodegradability, 
antioxidant activity, and the absorbance of UV irradiation,4,5 lignin has emerged as a prime 
candidate for biobased nanoparticles and nanohybrids.6 In this context, the advent of lignin 
hydrocolloids has transformed the possibilities of using lignin in many prospective enduses.7 
Especially the spherical and colloidally stable lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) display benefits 
compared to crude lignin powders that are poorly soluble in many common solvents and 
heterogeneous both in molecular weight and distribution of reactive groups in its backbone.8,9 
In addition to its intrinsic functional groups, covalent functionalization of lignin has already 
been proven to be very useful in extending applicability of LNPs.9 For instance, Zhao et al.
