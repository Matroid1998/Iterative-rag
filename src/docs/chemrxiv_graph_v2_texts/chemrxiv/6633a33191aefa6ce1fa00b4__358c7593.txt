Description:
Functions as a neuromodulator, vasodilator, and inhibitor of proinflammatory molecule production.

Text:
At low concentrations, H2S functions as a neuromodulator, 
vasodilator, and inhibitor of proinflammatory molecule production. It also modulates synaptic 
transmission, improves neuronal excitability and survival, lowers oxidative stress, advocates 
the secretion of gastric juice and enzymes, and prevents the growth of certain microbes that are 
nonbeneficial to the gut microbiota 4. Hence, DT has a wide application in the food and 
nutrition sector, but it is being restricted by its high reactive, unstable and heat labile nature. Exposure to high H2S levels can be hazardous for an individuals health. Excessive amount of 
H2S has been linked to a few illnesses, including ulcerative colitis, heart problems, and 
neurological diseases. Therefore, DTs release must be balanced and regulated.
