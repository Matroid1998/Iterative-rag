Polyoxometalates are polyanionic aggregates comprised of early transition addenda atoms and oxide 
anions.14 Addenda atoms are fully oxidized to d0 electron configurations capable of forming various 
topologies employing MOx units as the principal building block. 14 Conventionally, POM based 
clusters are formed from the acidification of aqueous molybdate or tungstate oxoanions.5,6 The 
controlled pH treatment of polyoxo species under strictly controlled conditions results in the formation 
of lacunary anions, which are formed by partial decomposition of their parent compounds.79 These 
complexes have formally lost one MO vertex and possess reactive cavities with high charge density 
around the defective region due to the negatively charged oxygen ligands.
