Description:
An interlayer compound with a singlet energy level of 2.4 eV and a triplet energy level of 1.3 eV, used to improve NIR-to-visible solid-state upconversion.

Text:
This ideal interlayer would possess a triplet energy level between that of 
rubrene (T1  1.14 eV)78 and the PbS QD bandgap (1.2 eV) while possessing a singlet 
energy level higher than that of rubrene (S1  2.25 eV).78 As shown in Figure 1e, this 
proposed device architecture prevents the parasitic BT by acting as an uphill energetic 
barrier while maintaining the triplet energy flow to the rubrene through downhill energy 
transfer processes (ET1, ET2).65,67,74,75 
Here, we report the use of 5tetracene carboxylic acid (TCA, S1  2.4 eV, T1  1.3 eV, 
see Figure 1e)79 as an interlayer to improve NIRtovisible solidstate UC. In addition to 
improvements in BT alleviation (i.e., reduction in BT), we observe improvements in triplet 
extraction (ET1ET) efficiencies from PbS.
