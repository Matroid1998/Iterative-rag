Description:
Engages with polar facets during crystallization, crucial for structure formation.

Text:
This anisotropic growth along the caxis contributes to the
unique optical and piezoelectric properties of ZnO nanorods, making them particularly
useful in applications like sensors, actuators, and photovoltaic devices. Interestingly, the
growth of the crystalline rods is largely towards the caxis since it has a lesser
thermodynamic stability in regards to surface dipoles located on polar faces than on
nonpolar faces (7). During crystallization, the polar facets actively engage with zinc
hydroxyl (Zn(OH)) and hydroxyl (OH) ions, which are crucial for the structures formation,
