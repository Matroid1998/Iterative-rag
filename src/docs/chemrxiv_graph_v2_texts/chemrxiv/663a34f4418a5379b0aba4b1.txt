Description:
Present in amino (NHx) groups, increasing with reaction cycles on alumina and silica.

Text:
They found that the amount of hydrogen in amino (NHx) groups increased with the 
number of reaction cycles on both alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) substrates, suggesting that 
more NHx groups were formed on the Al2O3 and SiO2 surfaces as the reactions progressed. The 
interaction of TMA with dehydroxylated SiO2 involved ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl (
OH) groups and dissociation in siloxane (SiOSi) bridges, leading to surface saturation with 
methyl (CH3) groups, followed by the replacement of these CH3 groups by NHx groups upon 
reaction with NH3, indicating a stepwise transformation of the surface chemistry.
