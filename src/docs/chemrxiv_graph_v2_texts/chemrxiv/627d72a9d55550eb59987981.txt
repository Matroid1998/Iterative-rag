The primary determinant of oxidative milk flavor.

Text:
The oxidation of milk 
releases fatty acids, the primary determinant of oxidative milk flavor (Li  Wang, 2016). Malondialdehyde (MDA) is currently widely used as a typical indicator for assessing the 
changes caused by this oxidative stress (Tsai  Huang, 2015). Variations in the proportion of available volatile organic components have the greatest 
impact on sensory qualities and, as a result, reflect on the consumer perception of milk 
(Villeneuve et al., 2013). It would be highly beneficial to rely on an effective approach for 
identifying and quantifying volatiles responsible for the measure of freshness in milk for 
assessing its overall taste quality (Vrhovsek et al., 2014).
