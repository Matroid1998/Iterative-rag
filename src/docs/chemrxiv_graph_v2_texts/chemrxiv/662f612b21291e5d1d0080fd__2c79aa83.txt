Description:
A microporous solid with pores that molecules must navigate to access reaction sites.

Text:
Previously, we did not consider
the role of diffusion; in the leadup to the reaction, molecules
must navigate the zeolite pores to access reaction sites and the
reaction site becomes accessible for further reactions after prod
uct molecules diffuse away. At elevated temperatures the reac
tion potentially becomes diffusion limited, if the ratelimiting step
shifts to diffusion of reactants in and products out of the reac
tion site. Many factors affect the diffusion of molecules in mi
croporous solids, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have
long been used to elucidate the dynamics of organic molecules in
porous systems.

Description:
A material with a flexible framework affecting diffusion properties.

Text:
Key to this is the flexibility of both the organic
and inorganic components.11 It is not possible to know a priori
how zeolite flexibility will affect diffusion, so results with a fixed
framework cannot be extrapolated to one which is flexible.12
