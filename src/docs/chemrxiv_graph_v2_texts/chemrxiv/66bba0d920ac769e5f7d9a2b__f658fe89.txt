While poly(2
methyl2oxazoline) is completely soluble in water, poly(2ethyl2oxazoline), poly(2npropyl2
oxazoline), 
poly(2isopropyl2oxazoline) 
and 
poly(2cyclopropyl2oxazoline) 
show 
thermoresponsive behavior with LCST.13 One of the most studied homopolymers belonging to the 
POx family with an LCST is poly(2ethyl2oxazoline) (PEtOx) with a Tcp above 60 C in water. Known ways to tune the cloud point of PEtOx solutions are controlling molecular weight,24 polymer 
architecture,25 and modifying solvent quality, e.g. by adding Hofmeister salts into the system.26 
The first study about the solution behavior of high molecular weight PEtOx samples reports a 
maximum Tcp of 70 C.27 Later studies showed PEtOxwater systems have a FloryHuggins type
