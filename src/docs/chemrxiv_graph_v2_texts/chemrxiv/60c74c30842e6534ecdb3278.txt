Description:
Effective inhibitors against the main protease of coronavirus.

Text:
These 
polyproteins are processed into 16 nonstructural proteins by the main protease (chymotrypsin
like protease), and subgenomic RNAs coding the structural proteins are produced from these 
nonstructural proteins 3. Therefore, the main protease is a vital part of the coronavirus life 
cycle. Viral replication can be stopped by inhibiting enzyme activity. Inhibitors should be 
nontoxic to humans due to different cleavage specificity between the main proteases of human 
and coronavirus. Many researchers have focused on new inhibitor design and identification of effective ready
touse drugs for inhibition of the main protease. Several studies have demonstrated that 
ketoamides are effective inhibitors against the main protease 4, 5. Numerous studies have also 
discovered that some approved drugs may inhibit enzyme activity 68.
