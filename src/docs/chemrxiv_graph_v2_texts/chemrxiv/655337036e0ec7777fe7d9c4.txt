Description:
The hydrogen atom's bound energy levels and wave functions are key to understanding the level structures of heavier atoms.

In undergraduate courses of Chemistry, quantum mechanics of onedimensional systems 
occupy a prominent position. Quantum states of a particle in a onedimensional potential well, 
rigid rotator on a plane, harmonic oscillator, etc. are taught to demonstrate the techniques of 
arriving at solutions of the Schrodinger equation (SE) posed as a boundary value problem, 
emphasizing at the same time the importance of all mathematical conditions imposed on the 
wavefunctions. It is almost mandatory in all such courses to venture a little beyond and discuss 
quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom in three dimensions. The bound energy levels and 
wave functions of the hydrogen atom are key to the development of general ideas and 
understanding of the level structures of heavier atoms.
