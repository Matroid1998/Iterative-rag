Description:
Exhibits stronger electrostatic interactions in aqueous solution compared to dodecaborate dianions.

Small boron clusters have been touted for use as therapeutics and as precursors for boron
based nanomaterials.14 In particular, the closododecaborate cage species, (B12X12, 
X  H, F, Cl, Br, I), have attracted interest due to their extraordinary structural and electronic 
stability, which gives rise to a variety of interesting phenomena and promises application in areas 
such as energy storage, catalysis, and neutron capture cancer therapy.58 The B12X122 
(X  H, F, Cl, Br, I) dianions have quadruply degenerate gu symmetry cagecentred HOMOs that 
are predominantly localised on the boron cage framework..9 In the case of B12F122, the negative 
charge density is delocalized about the surface fluorine atoms, whereas larger halogenated 
analogues such as B12I122 have the negative charge delocalization contained within the boron 
cage.9 As a consequence of the delocalized excess electron charge density and the charge 
separation of ion pairs involving B12X122 species, dodecaborate dianions exhibit relatively weak 
electrostatic interactions in aqueous solution compared to more common dianions such as SO42 
and HPO42.

Description:
Small dianions that are unstable in the gas phase.

Text:
Owing to this behaviour, B12X122 dianions are often referred to as weakly 
coordinating or superweak anions.9,10 In the gas phase, however, small dianions such as SO42 
and HPO42 are unstable, whereas B12X122 species may be readily produced, trapped, and 
probed.6,11,12 This exceptional stability enables the study of ionic clusters containing B12X122.
