Description:
Used as a fuel in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFC).

Text:
Many electrochemical conversion and storage technologies such as Liion and solidstate batteries, fuel 
cells and capacitors are being heavily investigated to decarbonise our environment18. Fuel cells is one 
of the promising technologies and depending on the nature of the electrolyte used in the fuel cell there 
are various types of fuel cells Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), 
Polymer Electrolyte (Proton Exchange) Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell 
(PAFC), Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) and Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFC). Broadly these fuel cell 
types can also be classified as hightemperature devices, such as SOFC and MCFC, and lowtemperature 
devices such as PEMFC, PAFC, DMFC and AFC.
