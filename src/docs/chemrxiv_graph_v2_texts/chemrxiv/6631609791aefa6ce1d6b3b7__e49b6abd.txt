Description:
A unit used in the nomenclature for describing the structure of certain compounds.

Text:
(1994) proposed a 
56 
nomenclature including the descriptor for the monosaccharide unit and the position of the 
57 
sulfate group in combination with the letter S. According to this nomenclature, a 1,3linked D
58 
galactopyranose that is sulfated at position O4 is for example named G4S (Knutsen et al., 
59 
1994). Moreover, the structures of carrageenans are often described by using repeating 
60 
disaccharide motifs (consisting of one G and one DDAunit). Depending on the disaccharide 
61 
unit present, carrageenans are categorized into different types, which are abbreviated with 
62 
Greek letters. The most commercially important types are carrageenan (G4SDA), 
63 
carrageenan (G4SDA2S), and carrageenan (G2SD2S,6S) (Usov, 1998; van de Velde 
64 
 Ruiter, 2001).
