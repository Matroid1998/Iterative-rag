Description:
Building blocks used in the three-component PBM reaction to access diverse C(sp2)rich chemical space.

Text:
Among these, the threecomponent PBM reaction, first reported 
in 1993 19, has been an attractive method for medicinal chemists due to its ability to use widely 
available building blocks including amines, aldehydes, and aromatic boronic acids to rapidly 
access diverse C(sp2)rich chemical space17. However, PBM reaction remained underutilized 
because the substrate scope has been mainly restricted to activated aldehydes with adjacent 
heteroatoms as directing groups and aryl or alkenyl boronic acids. As most reactions of this class 
are mediated by a 2e mechanism where alkyl migration is unlikely to happen20, extending this 
reactivity to unactivated alkyl boronates, to escaping from the flatland 3, has been a challenge.
