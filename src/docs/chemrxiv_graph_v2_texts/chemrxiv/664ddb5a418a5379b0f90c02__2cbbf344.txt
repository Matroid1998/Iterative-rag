Description:
Catalyzes reductive hydroboration to enamine and its electrophilic functionalization.

As a result, most of the isoquinoline natural products con
taining metaalkyl substitution were synthesized from their al
kyl substituted acyclic precursors.6 
In a more direct approach, Minter and Re in 1988 showed a 
onepot multistep operation for effective metaCH alkylation 
of isoquinolines with aldehydes (Figure 1A).7a This strategy is 
based on reductive hydroboration, followed by electrophilic 
functionalization of the resulting enamine, and finally, dehydra
tiontautomerization for the overall metaalkylation. The reac
tion was shown to work only with aldehydes, limiting it to the 
installation of primary alkyl groups. In 2022, the Wang group developed an improved Lewis acid 
catalyzed reductive hydroboration to enamine and its electro
philic functionalization at metaCH.
