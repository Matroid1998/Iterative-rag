Description:
Molecules that can undergo posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation.

While public implementations are avail

able for specific encoding methods (e.g.,15,16), bringing
17
them together into a single project often requires depen
18
dency alignment and possible incompatibility hurdles. 19
Here, we introduce peptidy  a lightweight Python li
20
brary that implements various peptide representations for
21
machine learning. Key features of peptidy are the fol
22
lowing
23
 it has no external dependency and integrates smoothly
24
into all modern Python environments;
25
 it encompasses a range of strategies for peptide en
26
coding, useful for predictive and generative machine
27
learning applications;
28
 it supports several posttranslational modifications to
29
amino acids e.g., phosphorylation, acetylations, and
30
methylation, extending the capabilities of existing
31
Python packages.
