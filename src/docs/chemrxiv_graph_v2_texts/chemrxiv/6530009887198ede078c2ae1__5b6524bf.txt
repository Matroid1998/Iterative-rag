Description:
A volatile and critical material lost during pyrometallurgy.

Text:
Pyrometallurgy utilises 
high temperatures to smelt batteries to form an alloy, which is then treated to recover valuable metals such as Co, Cu and Ni. An 
advantage of the technique is that the batteries do not have to be sorted before undergoing the smelting process. However, the 
process has some disadvantages, such as the loss of volatile and critical materials (e.g. Li, graphite and phosphorus), and toxic 
emissions. Furthermore, the use of high temperatures is energy intensive and allows limited volumes (i.e.
