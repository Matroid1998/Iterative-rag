Description:
Undergoes symmetry lowering phase transitions on cooling with three well-characterised polymorphs.

Text:
Interpenetration of the two
networks results in a bipyramidal hexagonal Asite co
ordination environment with 6 equatorial O and two ax
ial O. The atoms are coloured as follows Asite blue,
Bsite purple, O red, and O black. The images were
generated using VESTA.17
Bi2Sn2O7 is unique in undergoing symmetry
lowering phase transitions on cooling and has
three wellcharacterised polymorphs the high
temperature cubic  phase undergoes a second
order phase transition to Bi2Sn2O7 above 900
K, followed by a rstorder phase transition to
Bi2Sn2O7 around 390 K.18 Bi2Sn2O7 pos
