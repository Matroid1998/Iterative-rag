The gold standard in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Text:
One big analytical challenge is the detection of levodopa within human blood serum.38 The drug levodopa is the 
gold standard in the treatment of Parkinsons disease.39,40 Up to now, monitoring of levodopa blood levels has not 
really been implemented, due to timeconsuming and complex laboratory methods like liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry.41 Nonetheless, measuring levodopa blood levels can be a crucial step to get the best treatment 
for an individual patient and decrease the risk of levodopainduced side effects like dyskinesias.38,41 Dyskinesias 
exhibit a direct correlation with the levodopa plasma concentration and are absent within a precise therapeutic 
window.41 The complex milieu present in human blood demands high selectivity and high sensitivity sensors to 
obtain accurate and reliable measurements.

Description:
A compound detected using SWCNT sensor barcodes in biosensing applications.

Text:
Simultaneously, for a final device one needs to consider requirements 
for onsite monitoring of patients. To address this challenge, we wanted to construct a portable and lowcost reader for levodopa detection based on 
SWCNTsensor barcodes. We start by simulating the SNR for NIR fluorescence detection in typical scenarios and 
with different detectors. We compare Si and InGaAs PIN photodiodes for SWCNT biosensing and detect levodopa. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20259lf2t ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000306389822 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
