Description:
A unit involved in the modification of 4triangulenes through a triple electrophilic borylation reaction.

doped triangulenes by the boron atom mainly focus on the 3triangulene, in which the edges can be 
bridged by carbon atom and many other heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen.12,14 However, the 
studies on edgedoped triangulenes by the boron atom were excluded until the 4triangulenes edge
modified by nitrogenboronnitrogen (NBN) was reported recently.17 Since examples of borondoped 
triangulenes are still rare, further development of new borondoped triangulenes is highly desirable. We herein disclose a straightforward path to access a series of 4triangulenes with three oxygenboron
oxygen (OBO) units (Figure 1) involving a triple electrophilic borylation reaction. The photophysical and
