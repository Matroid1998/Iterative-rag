Description:
Typically used as porous electrodes in reactors.

Text:
The reactor includes electrodes (typically porous
carbon) sandwiching a separator (typically an ion exchange membrane) that is devised to
inhibit mixing between posolyte and negolyte while maintaining ionic conductivity. Many
RFB designs employ redoxactive metal ions as reactants.4,5 In this case, capacity fade may
be caused by crossover of reactants through the membrane, parasitic side reactions that
unbalance battery state of charge (SOC), and precipitation.6 For example, each of these
mechanisms may operate in the incumbent allvanadium RFB,79 although crossover is the
