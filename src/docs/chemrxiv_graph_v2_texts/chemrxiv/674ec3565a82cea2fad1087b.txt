Description:
Has a response property relevant to organic room-temperature phosphorescence materials.

Text:
Organic roomtemperature phosphorescence (RTP) has garnered significant attention due to its 
unique characteristics, such as long excitedstate lifetime, low cost, oxygen response property, and 
morphological sensitivity.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 These features render RTP materials highly attractive for a wide 
range of applications, including photoelectric devices, biological imaging, information encryption, 
and sensitive sensing.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Since the tripletinvolved transitions in organic molecules are 
forbidden and triplet exciton tend to undergo rapid nonradiative decay, the challenge lies in
