The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, Eq. 1) is one of the most studied electrochemical processes, both experimentally and

theoretically. 6

During the ORR, four electrons per oxygen molecule must be transferred. At the same time, several chemical bonds rearrange,

making it comparatively slow even on the most catalytically active surfaces, such as platinum and its alloys. Thus, understanding 
0 
the mechanism of the ORR to improve and develop catalysts has been the focus of many studies for many decades.
