Description:
Remote substituents that influence stereoselective glycosylations.

Text:
The use of substituents remote from a reaction centre to influ
ence the stereochemical outcome of reactions is widespread in 
chemistry.17 In the case of reactions proposed to proceed via 
oxacarbenium ions, this has been the subject of many studies.8
16 The role of esters as remote substituents in stereoselective 
glycosylations has been the topic of much controversy and de
bate, especially in relation to 4Oestermediated synthesis of 
biologically important 1,2cisgalactosides and fucosides 
(Figure 1).1728 Flowers first proposed that longrange partici
pation, whereby the axial 4Oester of a fucosyl donor forms a 
dioxolenium ion intermediate analogous to 1 with an inaccessi
ble face, could explain the high 1,2cisselectivity observed 
in fucosylations when benzoates were placed at the 4posi
tion.17,18 Many studies have since invoked this intermediate to 
rationalize 
stereoselective 
1,2cisgalactosylations 
and 
fucosylations.19,2123,2628 Computational studies have been used 
to support this hypothesis and, indeed, dioxolenium ions have 
been detected experimentally using infrared ion spectroscopy 
and cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy.22,23,29,30 However, these 
conditions are not representative of experimental conditions in 
the solution phase.
