Description:
An industrystandard material for low and high-temperature applications with ZT around 1 from 350-450 K.

Text:
The current industrystandard materials for
low and hightemperature applications are based on Bi2Te3 (ZT
1 from 350450 K,2 ZT up to 1.9 reported for nanostructured
(Bi1xSbx)Te3 alloys10,11) and PbTe (ZT up to 2.2 at 915 K with
endotaxial nanostructuring12). However, the low abundance of
Te precludes widespread adoption, and thus alternatives com
posed of more abundant elements are critical.2
The discovery of high ZT in orthorhombic SnSe (up to 2.6 in
single crystals13 and 3.1 in polycrystalline samples14) has led to
considerable interest in the group IVVI sulphides and selenides.

Description:
Cannot be replaced by SnSe for applications requiring the recovery of low-grade waste heat.

Text:
The favourable electrical properties of these materials are well
established from the use of SnS as a photovoltaic (PV) absorber
material,15 and SnS and SnSe also show unusually low latt as
sociated with the hightemperature Pnma Cmcm phase transi
tion.1619 However, the headline ZT in orthorhombic SnSe is
only achieved at high temperature, whereas many potential ap
plications of TEs require the recovery of lowgrade waste heat,2
and so SnSe cannot replace Bi2Te3.
