Description:
Cyclized to urazole under strong basic conditions.

Text:
Semicarbazide was cyclized to urazole on the 
material in a solid state step under strong basic conditions . The 
resulting urazolecontaining gel was a hydrogel, with 87 
swelling ratio and 0.91 mPa elastic modulus. Interestingly, the 
polymer backbone of the material is highly hydrophobic, with 
the ionic salt character of urazole conferring hydrophilicity. We 
also demonstrated that a urazolesalt ionic pair can be exploited 
as an ion exchanger. When the hydrogel was placed in tap 
water, it successfully removed Ca2 and Mg2 from the water.
