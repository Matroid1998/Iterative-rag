Description:
A functional group used to enable secondary crosslinking in biopolymers.

Text:
Physical hydrogelation in biopolymer (gelatin, collagen, etc.) solutions, induced upon cooling 
biopolymer solutions below their gelation temperatures26, has emerged as an avenue to enhance 
printability while retaining ECMmimicking microstructures, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Functionalization of biopolymers (e.g., methacrylation26b, 27, norbornene28 or thiol modification29) 
to enable secondary crosslinking has further improved ink printability and enhanced shape fidelity 
by locking the printed microstructures. However, these strategies suffer from reduced cell 
survival in the cooled cartridges30, require secondary crosslinking soon after deposition of a layer 
and yield poor interlayer bonding. Moreover, printing tall structures results in loss of shape fidelity 
owing to worsening heat transfer from the cold substrates31.
