The field of nanomedicine, utilizing nanoparticles for medical intervention, has captivated 
chemists and chemists alike over the past decades.14 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) 
have thrived into a leading contender in nanomedicine since their initial synthesis in the 1990s.5
7 This potential was further solidified in 2001 by ValletRegi et al.s groundbreaking 
demonstration of their application in drug delivery.8 These nanoparticles possess unique 
properties, including a confined space ideal for encapsulating therapeutic compounds, which has 
spurred numerous research groups to develop MSNbased drug delivery systems.911 MSNs 
own exceptional properties like high surface area, finely tunable pore structures, and abundant 
silanol groups, enabling versatile functionalization inside and out.1214 The breakthrough 
discovery of gated MSNs in the 2000s, particularly those functional in water, opened doors for 
developing sophisticated materials with stimuliresponsive molecular gates.15, 16 Attached to
