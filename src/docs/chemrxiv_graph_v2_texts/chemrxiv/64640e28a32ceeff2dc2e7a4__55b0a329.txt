Experimental Methods
a. Synthesis of AspirinCysteine
The
synthesis
of
the
aspirincysteine
conjugate
was
performed
using
N(3dimethylaminopropyl)Nethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride
(EDC)
and
Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as coupling agents. First, cysteine and aspirin were activated
in separate reactions by reacting it with EDC and NHS in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
room temperature for 2 hours. The activated cysteine and aspirin were then combined in
DMSO and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours under nitrogen atmosphere. The EDC
method creates a thioester bond between the carboxyl group of the aspirin and the thiol group
