Description:
Catalysts known to exhibit complex microkinetics in CO2 reduction reactions.

Text:
Computational 
74 
models for CO2RR on Cu catalysts known to exhibit complex microkinetics from experimental 
75 
literature still rely on simple and empirically defined electrochemical parameters such as Butler
76 
Volmer Equation (BVe).5 However, the kinetic parameters in BVe do not (and cannot) capture the 
77 
entire reaction network.6 In this work, we develop a new methodology for incorporating a complex 
78 
reaction network observed on Cu electrodes, using a 0D microkinetic model coupled with a mass 
79 
transport model. This paper centres on the method development and shows some preliminary results 
80 
obtained with the combined model. 81
