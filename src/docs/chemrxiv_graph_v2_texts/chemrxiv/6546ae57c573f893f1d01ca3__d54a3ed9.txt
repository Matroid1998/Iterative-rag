Description:
Act as the Lewis base in Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs).

Text:
Over the past two decades, Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) have 
successfully been employed in a variety of stoichiometric and catalytic 
transformations involving the heterolytic activation of bonds in small 
molecules.15 This reactivity is driven by the effective quenching of the 
frustration in the Lewis acidbase pair, which is caused by ring strain 
andor steric hindrance preventing the formation of the classical Lewis 
adducts in an intra6 or intermolecular7 manner (Figure 1, a). Seminal 
work mostly involved combinations of phosphines as the Lewis base 
and boranes as the Lewis acid. As the field evolved, a variety of FLP 
combinations have been developed based on combinations of different 
elements, such as ansaaminoboranes8 and geminal PAl FLPs.9 The 
scope of stoichiometric reactivity of FLPs with small molecules is vast.

Dual-function ligands that demonstrate pendulumlike hemilability.

Herein, we detail its synthesis, electronic structure and 
demonstrate the heterolytic activation of chemical bonds along the FLT 
vector. Finally, we show how this system displays pendulumlike 
hemilability between the dualfunction phosphines, demonstrating the 
promise the FLT motif holds for the heterolytic activation of chemical 
bonds. a) FLP Reactivity
