Description:
Used to grow external shells on quantum dots to increase particle size.

Furthermore, external silica shells 
can be grown on coreshell QDs to increase the particle size to near 100 nm.17,27 Although silica shells 
provide a path for deterministic positioning of emissive QDs, the singleparticle PL of silicashelled QDs 
suffers a high degree of blinking due to additional charged states induced by the CdSSiO2 interface.17,28 
The largest emissive QDs without silica shells reported in the literature up to now are the traditional 
quasitype II giant coreshell CdSeCdS QDs, with 1520 CdS monolayers (MLs) and total diameters 
ranging from 20 to 50 nm.2932 The giant CdS shells not only increase the size of the emissive QDs but 
also reduce blinking through Auger recombination suppression and isolate the exciton from surface 
interaction.29,33,34 In these quasitype II coreshell systems, the electron wavefunction is delocalized into 
the CdS shell, while the hole wavefunction is effectively confined within the CdSe core.
