are required813 to address the challenges 
and outperform existing energy density measurements in the metal ion batteries. As promising 
alternatives, lowcost, highly abundant divalent Mg2 (2.15)14 and Ca(4.86)15 facilitate 
improved energy density than Liion batteries due to possessing two transferable electrons.16 Mg 
exhibits a low electrode potential of 2.37 V (vs. SHE)17, including high specific capacitance (2205 
mAh g1) and high volumetric capacity (3833 mA h cm3). In contrast, Ca 18 has a volumetric 
capacity of 2052.6 mA h cm3 and a redox potential of 2.87 V (vs SHE) close to Li. Another 
challenge conventional monovalent batteries (Li, Na, and K) encounter is the formation of the 
detrimental needlelike dendrite on the metal anode interface19 during electrochemical 
platingstripping processes.
