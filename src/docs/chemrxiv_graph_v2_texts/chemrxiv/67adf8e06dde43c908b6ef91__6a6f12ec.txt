A cheap, relatively low toxicity and low viscosity chemical used as the source of reducing agents.

20 v. ethanol as the source of reducing agents,26,27 i.e. a cheap, relatively low toxicity and low viscosity chemical. The method is largely 
detailed elsewhere16,28 and leads to size controlled NPs in the range 530 nm. Despite 
the absence of common additives, the method leads to colloidal dispersions of NPs 
stable for months and even years.23,29 
The use of different alcohols leads to relative pros and cons summarized in Table 1.

Description:
Used in the room temperature synthesis of surfactant-free Au NPs.

Text:
Our recent investigation of the effect(s) of using different alcohols for the room 
temperature synthesis of the surfactantfree Au NPs showed that different formation 
pathways are followed for different alcohols used, namely methanol, ethanol, ethylene 
glycol, glycerol.29 The synthesis is faster in glycerol and lead to relatively small size 
NPs in the range 510 nm over a wide range of conditions (e.g. different concentrations 
of base andor alcohol contents). The synthesis using glycerol is also less sensitive to 
the light environment. The glycerolmediated synthesis is therefore overall more 
robust. However, a major drawback of the glycerolmediated synthesis is the use of a 
relatively viscous solvent.
