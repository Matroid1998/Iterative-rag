Description:
Characterized by a positively charged atom bonded with a benzyl group and an alkyl chain (C6-C18).

Particularly, the ban of triclosan and triclocarban in antibacterial soaps by the 
38 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 and the global pandemic of COVID19 beginning in 
39 
2020 have further promoted the use of BACs.46 BACs are one of the most common groups of cationic 
40 
surfactants, characterized by a positively charged quaternary ammonium nitrogen atom bonded with a 
41 
benzyl group and an alkyl chain (C6C18). Their amphiphilic properties enable them to adhere to solid 
42 
phases that are predominantly negatively charged such as sediment, soil, sewage sludge, and laboratory 
43 
glassware.7, 8 Literature studies have extensively reported the detection of BACs in the aquatic environment, 
44 
which are primarily composed of BAC homologs with alkyl chain lengths of 1218 carbons.
