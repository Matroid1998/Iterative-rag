Description:
Used in combination with polyols as solvents in synthesis.

Text:
In the last decade, much effort has been devoted to synthesize IONFs with optimized heating efficiency via 
synthetic routes that can offer a better control on their size, shape and crystallinity, while being compatible with 
scaleup for further industrial development.15 For this aim, the literature has shown many synthetic parameters 
worth investigating, including solvents of varying boiling temperatures (polyols, pure or mixed with poly(hydroxy) 
amines),16 iron oxide precursors (chlorides, nitrates, acetylacetonate),17 concentration of added salts such as 
sodium acetate,18 or polymers like poly(acrylic acid),19,20 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)21 or dicarboxyPEG,22 hydro 
or solvothermal pressure (i.e. use of an autoclave),23,24 or multistep (seedgrowth) method to prepare coreshell 
IONPs.25 Instead of polyols, Spizzo et al.
