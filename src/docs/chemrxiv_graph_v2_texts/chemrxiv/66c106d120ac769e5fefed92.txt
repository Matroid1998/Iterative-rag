Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which are crucial for the efficiency of zinc-air batteries.

The 
development 
of 
costeffective, 
sustainable 
and 
environmentalfriendly energy conversion and storage devices is 
a key path towards carbon neutrality.13 Rechargeable zincair 
batteries (ZABs) are amongst the most promising battery 
technologies as they combine high energy density (theoretical 
limit 1086 Wh kg1), economic viability and feasible scaleup.46 
However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction 
(ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result in high 
overpotentials and unsatisfactory efficiency, thereby causing 
major roadblocks in the development of ZABs.7,8 While noble 
metalbased catalysts might address some of these issues, their 
scarcity and high cost prohibit largescale commercialization.9,10 
Thus, the development of highly efficient and robust bifunctional 
ORROER electrocatalysts based on earthabundant elements is 
a grand challenge in sustainable energy research.11 
Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as 
promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts.12,13 In SACs, 
transition metal atoms (especially Fe, Co, Ni and Mn) are 
anchored on electroactive matrices, e.g.
