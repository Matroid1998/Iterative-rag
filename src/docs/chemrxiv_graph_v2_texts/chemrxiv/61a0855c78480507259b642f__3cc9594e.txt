Description:
A metal oxide used as a cocatalyst for water oxidation in photoanodes.

Text:
Such photoanodes are capable of visible lightdriven oxygen evolution upon deposition of a 
suitable cocatalyst for water oxidation, typically in form of metal oxide (IrOx, CoOx, NiOx) 
nanoparticles.24,3239 Notably, we found out that one of the crucial problems of the metal oxide 
nanoparticles as cocatalysts is their parasitic absorption of visible light, blocking thus the light 
absorption by the light absorber.
