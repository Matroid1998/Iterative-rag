Description:
Membranes that allow ultrafast water transport through subnanometre graphene-based channels.

Text:
Ultrafast water transport through graphene oxide membranes (GOMs) is considered to 
originate from the frictionfree movement of water molecules through subnanometre 
graphenebased channels1,2. In detail, GOM nanochannels consist of patches of graphitic and 
functionalized areas. Along the graphitic parts the water transport is considered frictionless 
and along the functionalized areas the water transport is partially hindered3,4. The assumption 
that the water transport is frictionless along graphitic domains originates from the use of the 
HagenPoiseuille (HP) equation to describe the water transport in graphenebased 
nanochannels. The HP equation allows calculating water flux through a channel if water 
molecules have zero velocity at the liquidchannel wall interface5. This condition is called a 
nonslip condition.
