Description:
Efficient polymer vector with excellent delivery properties and biocompatibility.

Alternatively, the nonviral vectors based on synthetic 
polymers such as poly(Llysines) (PLL),5 polyethylenimine (PEI),6 poly(aminecoesters) (PACE),7 
polyamidoamine (PAMAM),8 poly(lacticcoglycolic acid) (PLGA),9 poly(glycoamidoamine) (PGAA),10 
and poly(amino ester) (PBAE)11 have received increasing interests due to their safety features and lower 
manufacturing costs.12 However, the polymerbased vectors still require refinement and optimization.13 For 
examples, PEIbased vectors have relatively high genedelivery efficiency but exhibit high toxicity due to 
their poor degradability;14 PAMAM dendrimers are capable of DNA encapsulation and transfection, but can 
cause cell damages due to the strong electrostatic interactions between the dendrimers and the cell 
membranes.15 PBAEs and PBAEbased composite nanoparticles have shown promise as efficient polymer 
vectors with excellent delivery properties and biocompatibility, yet their targeting capability,16 delivery 
efficiency,17 and stability18, 19 still require improvement.
