Description:
Used in hydrogen storage systems for energy storage.

Text:
To effectively gather and store the energy produced by renewable 
sources is difficult in moving away from fossil fuels. Unfortunately, renewable energy sources 
are sporadic in nature and not entirely exploitable at the time of production. Therefore, there is a 
critical need for effective energy storage systems to utilise green energy in the future. There are 
many different types of effective energy conversion and storage devices on the market right now, 
including batteries, conventional capacitors, electrochemical capacitors, fuel cells and hydrogen 
storage systems 1, 2, 3. Fuel cells including solid oxide fuel cells because of their superior 
efficiency and fuel flexibility too are being investigated heavily by the scientific community 4, 
5, 6.
