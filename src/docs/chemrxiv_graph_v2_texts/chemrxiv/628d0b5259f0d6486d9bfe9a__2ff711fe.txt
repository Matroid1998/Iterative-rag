Description:
Used as ligands in complex compounds SnL2Cl2.

Text:
4Chloro3fluoro ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in 
asymmetric synthesis of pquinone diimide via organocatalyzed Michael addition of 
cyanoacetates 1, and in preparation of cyclopentadpyrimidine derivatives as Akt protein 
kinase inhibitors 2. 5Chloro2nitro ethyl PCA is mentioned in synthesis of 2
aminoquinoline derivatives reduced by ZnAcOH 3, and in synthesis of substituted 
quinoline1oxides and the complex compounds SnL2Cl2 (L  2aminoquinoline1oxides) 
with the aid of stannous chloride 4. 5Iodo2methoxyphenyl isopropyl PCA was prepared 
and copolymerized with styrene 5. 2,4,6Trimethylphenyl ethyl PCA is reported in 
analysis of the mass spectra of ethyl cyano(2 or 4substituted phenyl)acrylates 6; in 
catalyst study of the Knoevenagel condensation 7, and in synthesis and styrene 
copolymerization 8.
