Description:
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause damage to DNA.

Text:
DNA holds all of the genetic information required for development and survival for every liv
ing species and therefore is crucially important to protect from damage. Unfortunately, DNA
is constantly exposed to harmful sources such as radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS),
and other chemical agents. In response, our cells have developed ecient mechanisms for
recognizing and repairing various DNA defects. These mechanisms are of prime signicance
as damage to the genome can lead to the development of diseases such as neurodegenerative
disorders and cancer. A substantial fraction of these lesions are defect bases originating from the interaction of
DNA with ROS and ionizing radiation 13 and the majority among these concern oxidative
derivatives of guanine (G).
