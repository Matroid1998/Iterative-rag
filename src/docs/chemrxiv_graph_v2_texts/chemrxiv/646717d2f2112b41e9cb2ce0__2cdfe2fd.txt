Description:
The best catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with moderate adsorption energy for oxygenated species.

Text:
Pt is the best catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).13 It can be explained by the well
known Sabatier Principle for catalysis the binding energy between the reactant and the catalyst 
should be neither too strong nor too weak. It should be strong enough so that the bonds in the 
reactant are activated, but not too strong to block the subsequent desorption of products.45 For 
ORR, this principle can be expressed as a volcano curve, obtained by plotting the ORR catalytic 
activity against the adsorption energy of oxygenated species calculated by density functional 
theory (DFT).6 Among metal catalysts, Pt indeed occupies the central position, with moderate 
adsorption energy for oxygenated species and the highest catalytic activity, which is consistent 
with the Sabatier Principle.

Description:
A catalyst for ORR with optimal performance in fuel cells.

Text:
Much of the current search for a better catalyst for ORR, which is one 
of the key challenges in fuel cell technology, relies on this principle, with efforts directed at either 
lowering the content of the expensive Pt or finding materials with binding energy of oxygenated 
species close to the center of the ORR volcano curve.2, 5, 7 
In contrast, Au has been cited as an example of unfavorable catalytic activity for ORR, as the 
adsorption energies of oxygenated species are weak, putting Au near the volcanos foothill.6 It 
explains the experimental observations that ORR on Au electrodes generally goes through the 2e 
pathway, leading to the formation of H2O2 or OOH depending on the pH, which is less efficient 
for producing current than the 4e pathway on Pt catalysts.815 However, when the electrode 
potential is above 0.7 V (RHE) in alkaline solution, the ORR on Au(100) becomes a 4e process, 
and in fact the current is slightly better than that on Pt(111).89, 16 While this has been observed 
only on Au(100) within a narrow potential window (0.71.0 V RHE), it does fall into an important 
range for the optimal performance of fuel cells and pose a challenge to the Sabatier Principle and 
the ORR volcano plot.17 
A number of factors have been suggested, such as the presence of either OH or OOH,1213 
the promotion effects of H2O solvent,1718 or the disproportionation of HOO.19 The formation of 
OOH in the presence of H2O18 and the stability of OOH in the presence of OH20 have been 
examined by DFT calculations.
