Description:
A cis-protected dinuclear Rh(II) complex involved in the selective formation of molecular squares.

Text:
In such a case, the square complex should be 
selectively produced by pathway selection, inhibiting the triangular 
formation under kinetic control. Such a kinetic approach is rare in 
molecular selfassembly except unexpected observation of kinetic 
traps.4452 As far as we know, there is no report on the selective 
formation of a triangular or square complex under kinetic control. Cotton and his coworkers and others reported that molecular 
squares composed of cisprotected dinuclear Rh(II) complexes (Rh2 
Rh2(DAniF)22 
53 
and 
Rh2(O2CRCO2)2 
54) 
and 
linear 
dicarboxylates (L2) were selectively obtained in crystalline states.53,54 
As Rh(II)carboxylate coordination bonds in dinuclear Rh(II) 
complexes are relatively strong, the reversibility of the coordination 
bond is not high,55 which would let the selfassembly of the Rh4L4 
squares proceed under kinetic control.
