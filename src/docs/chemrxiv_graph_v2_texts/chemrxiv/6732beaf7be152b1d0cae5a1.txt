Description:
Typically found in rotator phases with rotational dynamics and disordering that enhances their plasticity.

Such behaviors have implications
for various applications, such as in lubricants,4 selfshaping droplets,5 lipid biomembranes,6
fuels,7 and phasechange energystorage materials.8 Rotator phases and liquidcrystalline
phases share similarities,9,10 such as hexagonal inplane order seen in both the RII rotator
phase of nalkanes and smecticB phases.11 In fact, rotator phases could be considered a
subset of smectic B phases but with rotational dynamics and disordering that enhances their
plasticity.9 Whereas smecticB phases are found in mesogens with rigid core structures,12,13
rotator phases are typically found in alkanes and oligomers, possibly polydisperse. Therefore,
understanding the presence and characteristics of rotator phases is of both fundamental and
potential technological interest.
