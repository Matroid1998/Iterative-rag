Description:
Simple, prebiotically relevant lipids that spontaneously assemble into vesicles.

Text:
Compartmentalization is critical for extant life as it allows for the protection of biochemical 
reaction networks and prevents dilution and the invasion of parasites. In even the simplest 
forms of life, compartmentalization is achieved through phospholipids that spontaneously 
assemble into vesicles. Phospholipidbased vesicles have been studied extensively as a 
model for the cell membrane or as the building blocks for synthetic cells.12 Moreover, lipids 
are used as a protocell model for how life could have originated in a compartmentfirst 
hypothesis.34 Excitingly, even simple, prebiotically relevant lipids, like fatty acids, also 
spontaneously assemble into vesicles.

Description:
Can assemble into compartments and show lifelike behavior.

Text:
Moreover, such vesicles can grow and 
spontaneously divide when supplied with building blocks.58 While fatty acids can assemble 
into compartments and show exciting lifelike behavior, there is a critical difference between 
such systems and life as we know it. Life maintains itself outside of equilibrium by converting
