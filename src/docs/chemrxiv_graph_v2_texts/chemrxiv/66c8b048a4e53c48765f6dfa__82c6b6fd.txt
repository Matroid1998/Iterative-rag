Description:
Undergoes CN cross-coupling to reveal glutarimide after high-pressure hydrogenation.

The exploration of novel glutarimidecontain
ing CBMs can alter the activity, depth of degradation, pharma
cokineticpharmacodynamic properties, and offtarget ne
osubstrate selectivity, which can impact the overall success of 
a potential degrader in the clinic.7 
One emerging class of CBMs is the N(hetero)aryl glu
tarimide, which has begun to find applications in a range of 
disease targets.8, 9 Despite the promise of this CBM in degrader 
drug discovery, efforts to rigorously explore structureactivity 
relationships (SAR) have been limited by the inefficient and be
spoke synthetic strategies currently employed (Figure 1B). Such strategies fall into two categories 1) alkylation of anilines 
with an halo glutarimide and 2) CN crosscoupling of a 
dibenzoyl pyridine which reveals the glutarimide after high
pressure hydrogenation.
