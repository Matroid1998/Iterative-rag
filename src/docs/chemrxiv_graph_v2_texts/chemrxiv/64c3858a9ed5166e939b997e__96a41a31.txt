Description:
A component of birnessite known for its abundance and low cost.

Text:
Pseudocapacitive materials operating in aqueous electrolytes offer the advantages of fast 
charging and high safety during their charge and discharge cycles, which are two crucial 
characteristics desired for electrochemical energy storage devices.1,2 Among the most 
promising pseudocapacitive materials, the birnessite MnO2 stands out due to its abundance, 
low cost, high theoretical capacity and stable cycling performance in aqueous electrolyte.310 
Moreover, its reaction mechanisms upon cycling in aqueous electrolytes (1M K2SO4), subject 
of debate, was recently elucidated by Augustyn et al.11 They demonstrated that birnessite 2D 
structure, with a large interlayer spacing resulting from the presence of nanoconfined structural 
water molecules, enables extremely fast and efficient intercalation of partially hydrated alkaline 
ions, leading to capacitive like electrochemical signature.

Description:
Phases with low electronic conductivity that negatively impacts capacity at high rates.

Text:
Nonetheless, the practical application of MnO2 phases is strongly hindered by their low 
electronic conductivity that negatively impacts the capacity at high rates.1215 To address this 
issue, various strategies have been explored in the literature.

Description:
Used in hybrid compounds to enhance electronic conductivity when combined with conductive materials.

Text:
One of the most common 
approaches involves synthetizing hybrid compounds by combining MnO2 with electronically 
conductive carbon material such as carbon nanotube,16,17 carbon fiber,18,19 graphene20,21 or 
conductive polymer.22,23 Another interesting approach to boost the electronic conductivity is 
the elaboration of compositesnanocomposites MnO2conductive metal24 or MnO2transition 
metal oxides.25,26 Although these approaches improve overall conductivity, the intrinsic 
electronic conductivity of the birnessite phase remains unchanged and the performance of 
composite electrode materials heavily relies on achieving a homogeneous distribution between 
the electronic conductive phase and MnO2.26 To overcome this issue, it is possible to 
incorporate heteroatom into birnessite to change its electronic structure and reduce its electronic 
band gap.2730 For instance, Liu et al.

Description:
A metal oxide with an electronic band gap of 1.03 eV.

Text:
have demonstrated through first principle calculations that 
a partial substitution of Mn34 by Fe3 in the metal oxide layer reduces the electronic band gap 
from 1.03 eV to 0.62 eV (for 33 mol of substitution) and enhances the specific capacity when 
compared to MnO2 at equivalent chargingdischarging rates.31 However, some aspects related 
to Fe incorporation into MnO2 (FeMnO2) still require clarification. The commonly used low
temperature synthesis, aiming at achieving nanostructuration, results in birnessite phases with 
poor crystallinity, limiting detailed structural investigations of the localization of Fe and its 
impact on the interlayer site (prismatic or octahedral). Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms 
in FeMnO2 during cycling remain unknown due to the potential redox activity of both Fe and 
Mn elements 31,32.
