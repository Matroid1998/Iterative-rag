Description:
A vinyl-based monomer used in radical polymerization.

Text:
So far, most of PEObased graft polymers are prepared with vinylbased 
monomers via radical polymerization, e.g., poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether 
methacrylate, PEGMA,3334 or with norbornenebased monomers through ringopening
