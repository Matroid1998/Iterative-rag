Description:
Compounds with zincblende structures characterized by sp3-like cornersharing tetrahedra.

Text:
The structures of the currently known zincblende boron pnictides (BN, BP and BAs), have dia 
topology (as cubic diamond) 18, which is characterized by the spatial arrangement of BN4, BP4 or 
BAs4 perfect (angle 109.47) sp3like cornersharing tetrahedra in threedimensional 3D nets (cf. Fig. 1a). Recently, we discovered a significant structural densification of zincblende BN and BP by 
adopting a quartzderived structure (qtz topology) characterized by distorted cornersharing BN4 
and BP4 tetrahedra 19,20. In this context, the present work extends our investigation to boron pnictides with heavier elements 
(As, Sb, and Bi). As in previous works 19,20, the studies are based on quantum mechanics 
calculations of the groundstate energy structures and derived properties in the framework of the 
density functional theory (DFT) 21,22.
