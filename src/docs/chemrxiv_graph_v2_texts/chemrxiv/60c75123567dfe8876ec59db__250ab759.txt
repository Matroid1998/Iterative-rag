Description:
Have higher oxidative stability and biostability, making them suitable for biomedical applications.

Text:
Furthermore, recent reports in comparison of the biocompatibility of polyether urethanes and 
34 
polycarbonate urethanes showed that polycarbonate based urethanes have higher oxidative stability and biostability, 
35 
which makes them good alternative to replace with polyether urethanes for biomedical applications 34, 37. 36
