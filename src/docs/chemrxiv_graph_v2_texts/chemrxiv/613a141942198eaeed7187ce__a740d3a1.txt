Description:
Planar indiene shows metallic behavior, while buckled indiene has a semiconducting nature.

Twodimensional (2D) crystals are the blazing lights on
the horizon of materials research due to their unique charac
teristics and intriguing applications 1, 2. The stability and
physical and chemical properties of these materials mainly
depend on the lattice structure and atomic arrangement. For
instance, the puckered, buckled, and planar arsenene show
signicantly different stability factors and electronic behav
ior from each other 3. In addition, the planar indiene shows
a metallic behavior contrasting with the semiconducting
nature of buckled indiene 4. In recent years a new class of 2D materials with pentag
onal structure is drawing considerable attention due to their
novel chemical and physical properties5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
