Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is the most plasticized of all polymers, giving it new properties and applications 
in e.g., packaging, construction materials, toys, healthcare... Over 80  of plasticizers produced are 
used for PVC (Rahman and Brazel, 2004). Phthalates, which are esters of phthalic acids, represent the 
most common PVC external plasticizers, such as bis(2propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP) or diisodecyl 
phthalate (DIDP), whose structures are shown in Figure 1 (Wypych, 2004). These phthalates have many 
advantages, such as excellent compatibility, low volatility and low cost (Bocqu et al., 2016). The 
carbonyl groups are able to form weak bonds with PVC on the CCl dipole and thus increase their 
compatibility and miscibility, forming a network based on weak interactions.
