Description:
Formed as a competing side reaction in the hydrogen evolution reaction under CO2RR conditions.

Text:
Interestingly, CO2 conversion via the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a 
very interesting process as it is carried out under mild operating conditions, usually at room 
temperature and moderate pressures. In addition, renewable energy resources can provide the 
required electricity for electrolysis, making the electrochemical pathway also environmentally 
attractive. The electrochemical CO2RR is mainly limited by its selectivity challenge. On the one hand, 
the formation of H2(g) from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (i.e., equation 1) is observed for 
cathodic polarization, which is a competing side reaction under CO2RR conditions 24. On the 
other hand, there is the possibility of forming multiple C1 products (i.e., equations 2  5) or 
multicarbon products (i.e., C2) 25.
