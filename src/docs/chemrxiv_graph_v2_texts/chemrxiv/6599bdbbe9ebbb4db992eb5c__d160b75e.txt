Description:
A solvent where the syn conformation of Nacylhydrazones is prevalent.

This unique combination of 
structures holds considerable potential for diverse applications, encompassing both bioactive 
functionalities and within the realm of optoelectronic conduction.9 
The electronic conjugation intrinsic to these molecules can significantly influence 
charge transport properties, offering opportunities for exploitation in the development of 
optoelectronic devices such as organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs),10 and organic field
effect transistors (OFETs).11 
Building upon our prior studies,12,13 which consistently established the stable (E) 
conformation of Nacylhydrazones in various solvents, particularly the prevalence of the syn 
conformation in solvents like DMSOd6, we identified conditions favoring the anti 
conformation, including less polar solvents (e.g., CDCl3), intramolecular hydrogen bonding, 
or steric hindrance. The persistent dominance of the syn conformation, where crucial
