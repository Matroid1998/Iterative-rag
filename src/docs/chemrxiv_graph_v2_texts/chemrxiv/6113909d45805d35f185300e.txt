Description:
The dominant isotope 16O has no nuclear spin.

Since the dominant oxygen
isotope 16O has no nuclear spin, the 13C pair of 1,2
13C2squarate is magnetically isolated, eliminating all in
tramolecular dipoledipole contributions to singlet relax
ation. Furthermore, it is technically feasible to intro
duce nonmagnetic 18O nuclei into the squarate dianion,
as has been achieved previously for oxalate76. The in
creased mass of the 18O nuclei modies the vibrational
wavefunctions, inducing small secondary isotope shifts of
the 13C resonances77. These shifts may break the exact
magnetic equivalence of the 13C nuclei, providing access
to longlived 13C2 singlet order. Large values of the sin
glet relaxation time constant TS are therefore anticipated
for the 13C pair in 18Oenriched 1,213C2squarate, es
pecially at low magnetic eld, when the chemical shift
