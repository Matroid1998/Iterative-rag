Description:
Atoms that significantly populate secondary metabolites and small molecule probes.

Text:
Natures secondary metabolites as well as de novo designed small molecule probes are 
significantly populated with nitrogen atoms. HIV inhibitors1, ion channel modulators2, 
opioids3,4 and endogenous neurotransmitters5 (Figure 1a) are representative examples of 
relevant bioactive compounds showcasing Ncontaining motifs, many of which feature amines 
substituted with an aromatic group in position. Access to these prominent chemical blueprints 
in enantiomerically pure form is crucial, not only for accurate target engagement studies, but 
also for the optimization of their pharmacological profiles. A representative example is R()
dinapsoline, a selective and efficient D1 dopamine agonist5, which was found to be 161fold 
more potent than its S()enantiomer. The asymmetric synthesis of arylethylamines has typically relied on additions610 or 
hydrogenations of alkenes11,12 as well as on ring opening1315 and condensation reactions16.
