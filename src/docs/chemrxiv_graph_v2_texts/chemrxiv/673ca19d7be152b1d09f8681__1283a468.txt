Description:
A structural component added to vertices and ends of reactive cages and two-dimensional sheet models.

Theory suggests that the bulk of this 
fluxional mixture consists of relatively unreactive, large cages or 
other structures built up of tetrahedral O3AlMe and trigonal O 
groups in sixmembered, or larger (MeAlO)n rings.6,7 Reactive 
structures consist of strained cages, analogous to those 
adopted by the tbutylaluminoxanes,8 especially those with 
vicinal (MeAlO)2 rings,9 extended cages10 or nanotubes11 with 
reactive groups formed via the addition of structural Me3Al to 
the vertices and ends of these structures,12 and two
dimensional sheet models with reactive sites incorporating 
structural Me3Al along their edges.13 Recently, a component of 
this complex mixture was finally isolated and characterized by 
Xray crystallography.14 It has a formula of (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 
(hereinafter 26,9) and a molecular weight of 2156 g mol1, with 
a sheet structure and was used to activate metallocenes.

A component of the sample with a total content of 75%.

75 of total Me3Al content for the sample in question).20 The 
same study suggested a roughly spherical shape for bulk MAO 
based upon rg  9.3 and rH 11.7  as measured by SANS and 
PGSE NMR, respectively. Both estimates were in good 
agreement with earlier studies of T1 relaxation (rg  9.7 )21 and 
metallocene ionpair size (rH  1212.5 ) by PGSE NMR.22 
However, interpretation of the PGSE NMR data in terms of 
aluminoxane molar mass (5060 Al atoms for MAO20 vs. 150
200 Al atoms for the ionpair22) differed significantly between 
the two studies.
