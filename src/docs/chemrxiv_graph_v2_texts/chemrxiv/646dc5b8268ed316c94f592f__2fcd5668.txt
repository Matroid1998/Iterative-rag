Description:
A piezoelectric material with a positive longitudinal strain piezo coefficient, d33, that expands along the polar axis under an applied electric field.

Many modern devices such as resonators for radio fre
quency filtering, medical ultrasound, fuel injectors, sonar,
and vibrationpowered electronics rely on the piezoelec
tric property of materials that can convert mechanical
to electrical energy and vice versa. The piezoelectric
coefficients dij and eij, quantify the strength of the
piezoresponse. Usually the longitudinal strain piezo
coefficient, d33 of common piezoelectrics, e.g. PbTiO3,
is positive as the material expands along the polar axis
under an applied electric field in the same direction.
