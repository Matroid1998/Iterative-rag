Description:
Used in Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling for C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond construction.

Text:
C(sp2)C(sp3) crosscoupling reactions are highly valuable for efficiently building complex 
saturated sp3hybridized carbon atoms with key molecular functional groups for pharmaceuticals.1
3 Nicatalyzed crosselectrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a 
streamlined and practical approach for C(sp2)C(sp3) bond construction as it avoids strong 
organometallic nucleophiles and sensitive Ni0 precatalysts48 that are commonly used in traditional 
Nicatalyzed crosscoupling reactions, such as Negishi, Kumada, Suzuki, and Stille couplings.9, 4, 
10 Over the past several years, significant advances have been achieved in Nicatalyzed 
C(sp2)C(sp3) XEC of aryl halides and alkyl halides using chemical reduction,45, 8 photoredox 
mediation,1113 and electrochemical reduction1416, 12, 17 approaches.

Compounds that participate in Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions.

Text:
Electrochemical reduction is an ideal platform for XEC because it avoids metal powder 
reductants, offers controllable reduction potential and reaction rate, and can be easily integrated 
with flow synthesis.18, 14, 16, 19, 12, 20 Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions between aryl 
halides and activated alkyl halides, such as chloroesters and chloroketones, were reported as 
early as the 1990s,2123 but never emerged as a general synthetic strategy.

Description:
Aryl halides are involved in Nicatalyzed electrochemical C(sp2)C(sp3) XEC reactions and can undergo homocoupling to form biaryl products.

Text:
However, recently this 
methodology has received significant attention following the successful expansion of the reaction 
scope to unactivated alkyl halides through Nicatalyzed chemical C(sp2)C(sp3) XEC.2427 Under 
mild conditions, Nicatalyzed electrochemical C(sp2)C(sp3) XEC reactions are highly efficient 
for couplings between aryl halides and primary alkyl halides, while low yields and side reactions 
are often observed in the reactions between aryl halides and sterically hindered secondarytertiary 
alkyl halides.2829 One of the major side reactions is the homocoupling of aryl halides where biaryl 
products are formed through symmetrical coupling.28, 30, 29 Several strategies have been developed 
to overcome this problematic homocoupling issue and improve the selectivity of crosscoupling.

For example, Sevov and coworkers reported an overcharge protection method using redoxactive 
shuttles and a dynamic ligand exchange method using a mixture of Nligand and Pligand to 
control the Ni redox states in the XEC reactions between aryl halides and secondarytertiary alkyl 
halides.3133 Recently, Weix and coworkers reported a dualligand strategy to optimize the 
selectivity of Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions at high temperatures.3435 Some Ni
catalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions using conventional catalysts and under mild conditions 
were also reported, but these methods require activated alkyl halide substrates, such as
