Currently, the area of photovoltaics become revolutionized by newly emerging solar cells, 
organometal halide hybrid perovskites solar cell with its most recent efficiency jumps 
from 231 into 29.15.2 Remarkably, CH3NH3PbI3based perovskites have very long 
electron and hole carrier diffusion lengths, high optical absorption, unique defect 
properties.34 Furthermore, recent theoretical and experimental results have shown that 
CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits ambipolar selfdoping properties both good ptype and ntype 
conductivities can be realized by manipulating the growth conditions.5 Beside the 
exceptional high efficiency and VOC, lead halide perovskites are also capable of bandgap 
tuning from about 1.5 eV (CH3NH3PbI3) to 2.2 eV (CH3NH3PbBr3) by changing the 
compositions of perovskites.6 This capability makes lead halide perovskites as ideal 
candidates for all perovskites thinfilm tandem cell and other optoelectronic device 
applications.
