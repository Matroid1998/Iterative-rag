Moldable plastics are marketed as nontoxic; however, evidence shows that everyday consumer 
9 
plastic products leach and expose us to bioactive compounds (e.g., phthalates).16 Concerned 
10 
consumers query online forums, such as Physics Forum, and product pages for answers, asking 
11 
whether these materials are toxic and receive little definitive guidance from other users and 
12 
vendors.7

Due to their white color, moldable plastics have also been patented8 and marketed to consumers 
15 
for fashioning or securing false or prosthetic teeth (e.g., Instant Smile9). As such, this implies 
16 
short and potentially longterm oral exposure from something purchased for a positive outcome.
