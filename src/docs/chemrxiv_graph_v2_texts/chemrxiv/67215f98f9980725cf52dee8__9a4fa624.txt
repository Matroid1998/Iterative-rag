Description:
SiO2 polymorphs used in various classical force fields for molecular dynamics simulations.

While DFT calculations are feasible on 
relatively small zeolitic systems, their high CPU cost makes them unsuitable for applications at large 
time or length scales, or in highthroughput computational workflows (for example, identifying 
materials with a specific property by screening a database). In the specific case of pure silica zeolites, i.e. SiO2 polymorphs, a large number of classical force 
fields have been used in the literature, with different functional forms or parameterization. Combariza 
et al. reviewed various existing interatomic potentials1, and highlighted that accurate atomistic 
molecular dynamics simulations have to account for a delicate balance of interactions.
