Description:
Involved in many bonds vibrations where anharmonicity is significant.

Text:
NQEs often include zeropoint effects and tunneling effects, both
of which are related to the quantum delocalized nature of nuclei. NQEs are closely related
to many anomalous properties of water systems11,12 and some other hydrogenbonded sys
tems.8,13 For instance, the quantum delocalization of protons in the active site of the enzyme
ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) significantly stabilizes the deprotonated form of an activesite ty
rosine residue, resulting in its anomalous acidity.14 Additionally, NQEs can be manifested in
vibrational spectra, where a good description of NQEs will naturally describe anharmonicity,
which is significant in many bonds vibrations involving hydrogen atoms.1518
There have been many methods developed to incorporate NQEs and anharmonicities in
theoretical calculations.
