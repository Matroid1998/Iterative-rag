Description:
Minerals that contain physisorbed RE cations.

1113 Moreover, from previous studies it is evident that RE cations are present as physisorbed 
ions in aluminosillicate minerals such as kaolinite, halloysite, and muscovite. 1114 The recovery of 
these REEs using different extraction techniques has attracted increased attention. Over the decades, ionic liquids (ILs) have been used as potential solvents to extract various metal ions via 
solvent extraction. 1525 ILs have unique physicochemical properties, such as low vapor pressure, low 
melting point, nonflammability, and high recyclability, and thus are considered green solvents. 16, 17 
They can dissolve solutes that are weakly polar to polar and can act as a good alternative to organic 
solvents.
