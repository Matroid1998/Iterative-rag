Description:
Exhibit nonpolar surface and low selectivity towards CO2.

Text:
The main challenges of wellestablished industrial 
adsorbents such as zeolites and silica gels are quite high adsorption enthalpy and coadsorption of water, which is 
in most cases present in the gas mixture. On the other hand, activated carbons tend to exhibit nonpolar surface 
and therefore low selectivity towards CO2.
