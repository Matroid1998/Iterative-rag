For 
this, optical spectroscopy offers an exciting tool that allows us to build structureproperty 
relationships in solution.9, 10 Studies of the lanthanide(III) ions that luminesce in the near infrared 
(NIR) region, such as neodymium(III), erbium(III), and ytterbium(III), is, however, still limited 
by low emission intensities and poor detection capabilities.11 
Another important use of the optical properties of lanthanide(III) ions are as coordination 
complexes in solution. In the life science, they offer an advantageous alternative to traditional
