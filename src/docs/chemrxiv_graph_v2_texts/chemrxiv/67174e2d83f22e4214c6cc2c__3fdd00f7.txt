Description:
Involved in the reaction with glucosyl trichloroacetimidate as described in glycosylation studies.

Text:
Selfpromoted glycosylations with trichloroacetimi
dates have been described previously in the literature,17
and the first example was reported in 1980 by Schmidt
and Michel namely the reaction between acetic acid and
glucosyl trichloroacetimidate (Scheme 1).18
Carboxylic
acids and phosphorus acid derivatives that can react as
selfpromoters are called ABCH systems, named af
ter the reactions presumed eightmembered (pseudosix
membered) transition state as illustrated in Scheme 1.19
Most of the selfpromoted reactions described in the lit
erature involve imidate or imidatelike donors, and a self
