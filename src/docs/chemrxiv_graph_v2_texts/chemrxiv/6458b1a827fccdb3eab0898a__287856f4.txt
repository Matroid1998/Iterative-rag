Description:
Generated alongside hydrogen during water electrolysis.

Text:
Water dissociation into H2 and O2 through electrolysis, offers an alternative 
for hydrogen production, particularly when using electricity from renewable sources. An important 
amount of external electrical energy input is mandatory to overcome the water redox potential of 1.23 
V (1.6 V if we consider overpotentials at the electrodes). As an example, an industrial electrolyser 
producing 750 Nm3h consumes an electrical energy of approx. 5 kWh for each Nm3 of H2 produced 
7.
