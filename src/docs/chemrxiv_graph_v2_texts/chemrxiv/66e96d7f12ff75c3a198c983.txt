Description:
A component of the CAG trinucleotide repeat associated with Huntington's disease.

Text:
Huntingtons disease is the name of a hereditary cognitive disorder with motor, cognitive,
and psychiatric symptoms, affecting roughly 10 to 12 of every 100 000 people of European
ancestry.1 First thoroughly described in 1878 by George Huntington,2,3 the disease is today
known to be caused by a dominant autosomal mutation on chromosome four.4 The mutation
appears as an extraordinarily large amount of CAGtrinucleotide (Cytosine, Adenine, Gua
nine) repeats in the subsequently named Huntingtin gene.5 Since CAG codes for glutamine,
this results in an extended polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence in the Huntingtin protein (Htt),
which is intrinsically connected to disease pathogenesis.6
Htt is a comparatively large protein composed of 3144 amino acids (assuming a polyQ
length of 23 amino acids) that has remained highly conserved in vertebrates.7 Due to a
large number of known effector proteins, interactors and post transcriptional modifications,
the Htt protein is deemed to most likely be a pleitropic protein, suggested to be involved
in several biological processes.8,9 Htt is further known to be essential and is ubiquitously
expressed in the human body, but is primarily detected in the central nervous system and
