Furthermore, 
boron compounds show low toxicity and easy to separate boron from the reaction mixtures. Phenanthridine (3.1) is a nitrogen heterocycle that is the basis of DNAbinding fluorescent 
dyes through intercalation. Ethidium bromide and propidium iodide are the examples of such 
intercalating dyes. Phenanthridine is an isomeric compound of acridine (3.2) (Fig. 3.1). Fig. 3.1 Phenanthridine and acridine 
Phenanthridine was first discovered by Ame Pictet and H. J. Ankersmit in 1891 by pyrolysis 
of the condensed product of benzaldehyde and aniline. Earlier, phenanathridine and related
