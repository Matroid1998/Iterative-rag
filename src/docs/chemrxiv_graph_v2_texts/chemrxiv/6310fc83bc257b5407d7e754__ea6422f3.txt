Description:
Used in ammoniacal mixtures for Cu extraction with higher selectivity.

Text:
Of these leaching agents, sulfuric acid is the favoured solvent 
predominantly because its market price is lower than the other acids and it has been proven to 
be an efficient solvent, especially for the recovery of Cu 16. Ammoniacal mixtures and NaOH 
are examples of basic leaching agents for Cu recovery. The ammoniacal lixiviant is generally 
comprised of ammonia in combination with ammonium salts such as carbonates 17, chlorides 
18, or sulfates 19. The ammonia leaching process is more suitable for Cu extraction than 
acidic systems as these lixiviants show higher selectivity for Cu, leaving metals such as iron 
(Fe) and aluminium (Al) undissolved. However, it has been shown that nickel (Ni) and zinc 
(Zn) are also dissolved in the ammoniabased lixiviant. Most metals present in PCBs are
