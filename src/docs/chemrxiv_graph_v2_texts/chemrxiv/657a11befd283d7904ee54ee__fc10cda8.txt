4 ( 1  107 M1s1).10 Density functional 
theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics computational analysis, however, suggest that S2O83 
fragmentation occurs on time scales of  1012 s.10 Similarly, the free energy change for the 
homogeneous reduction of SO4 by Ru(NH3)62, based on E0 values of eqs. 1 and 5, DG  2.4
