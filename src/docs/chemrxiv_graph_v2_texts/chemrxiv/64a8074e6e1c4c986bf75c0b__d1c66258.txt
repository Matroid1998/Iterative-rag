Description:
A heavy atom used to enhance kp in conjunction with carbonyl functionalities.

Text:
kp can be 104105 s1 for 
heavymetal complexes,3 and only 10 s1 or less for conventional or
ganic compounds.1a Introducing heavy atoms, such as bromine, io
dine, selenium, and tellurium, in conjunction with carbonyl func
tionalities, is a classical approach to enhancing kp.4 Despite its long 
history, however, an organic kp over 100 s1 andor a p over 1 in 
solution are rarely observed (Figure 1a, blue filled circles; Figure S1 
and Table S1).5 The use of thiocarbonyls could provide a large kp in 
some cases (Fiugre 1a, blue open circles).6 However, they are asso
ciated with high (photo)chemical reactivities,7 thereby limiting their 
high p in perfluoroalkane solvents.6b The only practical way to im
prove p has been to suppress the nonradiative decay rate (knr).
