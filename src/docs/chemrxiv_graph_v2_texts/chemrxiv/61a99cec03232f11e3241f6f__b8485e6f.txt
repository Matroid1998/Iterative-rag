Description:
Involved in direct cyclopropanation of cyano aryl alkanes by light-mediated single electron transfer.

Text:
Methoxyphenylcyanoacrylates (MPCA) were reported in a number of studies 13. Thus, 
methyl MPCA was involved in direct cyclopropanation of cyano aryl alkanes by light

2 

mediated single electron transfer between donoracceptor pairs 1. Protic ionic liquid 
methylimidazolium thiocyanate was used as reagent, catalyst, and solvent in synthesis of 
MPCA 2. The thiol addition to benzalcyanoacetatebased Michaelacceptors were utilized 
to access dynamic covalent network films 3. Ethyl MPCA was synthesized by the 
Knoevenagel condensation catalyzed by imidazoliumbased ionic liquids 4 and by 
ethylene glycol  urea  NH4Cl low melting mixtureassisted reactions 5. Novel synthesis 
of furancarboxylate derivatives was reported via cyclization reactions of ethyl MPCA and 
ethyl glycinate hydrochloride 6. Propyl MPCA was prepared via cyanuric chloride
mediated threecomponent reactions involving Knoevenagel condensationcyano hydration
esterification 7.
