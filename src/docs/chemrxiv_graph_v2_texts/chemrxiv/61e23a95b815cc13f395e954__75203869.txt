Description:
Volatile compounds that can increase in levels as end-products of polyphenol oxidation.

Text:
Undesirable sulfurcontaining volatiles such as 2furanmethanthiol and 
42 
hydrogen sulfide may similarly react with quinones and form odorless quinonevolatile adducts, although with 
43 
slowers reaction rates.10 Also, Ferreira et al. tentatively identified the increased levels of some volatile phenols 
44 
as the endproducts of polyphenol oxidation using SPEGCMS.8 These studies illustrate how oxidation in wines 
45 
occurs rapidly following contact with oxygen, which is accompanied by a series of sensory alterations involving 
46 
aroma loss and formation. 47 
However, it remains unclear whether other important wine aroma compounds, such as esters, are so readily 
48 
affected by oxidationrelated reactions in wines exposed to air for a short time.
