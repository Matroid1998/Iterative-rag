Description:
Used in photoinduced XAT for C(sp3)C(sp3) bond formation under near-UV or blue-light irradiation.

Moreover, succeeding in this challenge would provide a 
cheap, tunable and sustainable alternative for other XAT
based approaches17 using silyl18 and aminoalkyl radi
cals.19 To this end, we disclose our results regarding the de
velopment of a mild and broadly applicable protocol for 
C(sp3)C(sp3) bond formation using photoinduced XAT by 
NHCligated boryl radicals under both nearUV or bluelight 
irradiation (Figure 1D). The key role of the NHCligated 
boryl radicals in the operative reaction mechanism has been 
uncovered through a combination of experimental, spectro
scopic and computational studies.
