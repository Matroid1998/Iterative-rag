Description:
Compounds that allow direct CC bond formations or nucleophilic additions.

Thus, access to derivatives are typically carried out 
via a stepwise fashion usually requiring initial demethylations of 
trialkylamine NCH3 groups to via free NH for subsequent 
transformations.2228 That is until the renaissance of single 
electron transfer (SET) redox methods, partly driven by 
photoredox catalysis, which revolutionized the practice of organic 
chemistry29 allowing direct CC bond formations or nucleophilic 
additions to benzylic amines and a few examples on simple 
aliphatic amines.3036 Still, reports on strategies for LSF of complex 
substrates  especially trialkylamines  are rather scarce.37
