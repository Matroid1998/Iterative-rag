Description:
Derivatives annulated by the insertion of oxygen in their ortho position, exhibiting high planarity.

Text:
of heteroatoms 
into electronacceptor units enables their properties to be finetuned and new applications to emerge. In this study, we present the preparation 
of BisAzaCoroneneDiimide derivatives annulated by the insertion of oxygen in their ortho position. These compounds exhibit high planarity 
and their properties are sensitive to the extension of their system. Their performance in preliminary organic electronics studies is also 
reported.
