Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is among the most studied transition metal dichalcogenides, a 
family of materials characterized by their twodimensional character with individual layers 
stacked by van der Waals forces1. MoS2 has gained attention due to its applicability in a wide 
range of fields like electrochemical energy storage2, 3 and electrocatalysis4, 5. There are 
several polytypes of MoS2, with the naturally occurring, semiconducting 2HMoS2 and 3R
MoS2 polytypes, and the synthetically accessible, metallic 1TMoS26. The functional 
properties of MoS2 are highly dependent on the polytype, as well as on the morphology and 
crystallite size of the material, which is why synthesis strategies able to control these 
properties are required7, 8.

Description:
Its electrochemical charge storage and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance depend on its crystal structure and morphology.

Text:
For 2HMoS2, an irreversible transition to 1TMoS2 during the first electrochemical 
lithiation cycle at around 1.1 V vs. LiLi leads to an unfavorably low initial Coulombic 
efficiency17. The findings underline the significance of controlling MoS2 crystal structure, 
crystallite size, and morphology, to obtain desired functional properties. Not only electrochemical charge storage, but also the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution 
(HER) performance is dependent on MoS2 crystal structure and morphology18. This led to 
the exploration of various hydrothermal synthesis routes controlling MoS2 structure by choice 
of sulfurprecursor1922. Liu et al. found that thioacetamide (TAA) and Lcysteine (LC) 
possess lower decomposition temperatures than thiourea (TU), thereby releasing sulfur more 
readily, leading to smaller particle sizes and the tendency to form the 1Tpolytype, which in 
turn, leads to a favorable HER activity23.
