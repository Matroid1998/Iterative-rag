Description:
A biorenewable material used to synthesize green polymers.

Text:
Limonene oxide (LO, Figure 1a)12 is a biorenewable material 
that can be used to synthesize green polymers, which can then 
be naturally depolymerized and minimize the current white 
pollution.34 LO can be easily prepared from limonene, an 
abundant terpene extracted from citrus that has already gained 
wide application as a solvent and insecticide.5 LO is largely used 
as a monomer to be copolymerized with CO2 to form 
poly(limonene carbonate) (PLC, Figure 1b),613 or anhydrides to 
form polyesters.1418 However, few reports exist on the 
homopolymerization of LO. In 1985, poly(limonene oxide) (PLO) 
was prepared for the first time by a radiationinduced cationic 
polymerization,19 with a molar mass averaging 2.0 kDa.
