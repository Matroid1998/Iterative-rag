Description:
A classic covalent solid.

In this context, the development
of extensions such as SelfConsistent Charge (SCC) DFTB (also known as DFTB2)7 and DFTB389
have been highly influential. Recently, the development of hybrid functionals and machine learning
(ML) approaches in DFTB have further expanded its domain of applicability1011. However, being a
semiempirical method, the availability of general parameterizations remains a bottleneck towards more
widespread adoption. Historically, more or less systemspecific parameterizations have typically been used. Prominent ex
amples are the MIO7, 12, OB2,13 and 3OB8 parameters for organic and biomolecules, developed by
Elstner and coworkers. For solids and materials, the PBC14 and MATSCI15, 16 parameters can be
used for classic covalent solids like C and Si, as well as several important oxides and minerals.
