On one hand, introducing a heavy atom into a molecular
structure is like introducing a defect. Defects are wellknown
to cause a reduction in the thermal conductance. 1619 On
the other hand, one might expect that incorporating heav
ier atoms into single molecules would increase their thermal
conductance as the increased mass could shift more vibra
tional frequencies below the Debye frequency of the elec
trodes. This effect is related to the peak position in phonon
transmission, which depends on the force constant of the
bond, k, and the reduced mass between two atoms, 
p

This concept is applied to explain why alkanes have higher
thermal conductance compared to polyynes 20 polyynes
have stiffer bonds, meaning their bond force constants are
higher.

Description:
Have a wider separation between phonon energy levels, leading to fewer levels below the Debye frequency of the electrodes than in alkanes.

As a result, there is a wider separation between
phonon energy levels in polyynes, leading to fewer levels
falling below the Debye frequency of the electrodes than in
alkanes. In this paper, we will explore the role of heavy atoms and
their impact on phonon transport through single molecule
junctions. We will provide a detailed investigation into the
impact of atomic mass on phonon propagation, aiming to
shed new light on heat transfer at the single molecule level. By starting with a simple 1D forceconstant model and ex
tending to a variety of molecular classes, we show that heav
ier atoms can be used to reduce the thermal conductance of
single molecules. Theory
We evaluate the phonon thermal conductance, ph, using
the nonequilibrium Greens function (NEGF) formalism.
