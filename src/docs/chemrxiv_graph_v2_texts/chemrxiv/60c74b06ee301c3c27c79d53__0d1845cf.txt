Description:
Can be employed for crosslinking of polymers with advantages such as ability to crosslink saturated and unsaturated elastomers, high temperature resistance, good elastic behavior at higher temperature, low moisture uptake, and no staining or discoloration of the resulting products.

Inter alia, chemical crosslinking can be 
achieved by UV or reactive functional groups or enzymatic crosslinking 6, 8, 12, 15. However, 
photopolymerization requires a photosensitizerinitiator and relatively highenergy irradiation. Crosslinking with various commercially available crosslinkers can lead to cytotoxic effects 15, 16, 
alternatively specific biological triggers can be utilized 17. Alternative crosslinking methods remain 
to be sought after. It was previously reported that peroxides can be employed for crosslinking of polymers 18
22. Their main advantages as crosslinking agents are (1) ability to crosslink saturated and 
unsaturated elastomers; (2) high temperature resistance; (3) good elastic behavior at higher 
temperature; (4) low moisture uptake; and (5) no staining or discoloration of the resulting products.
