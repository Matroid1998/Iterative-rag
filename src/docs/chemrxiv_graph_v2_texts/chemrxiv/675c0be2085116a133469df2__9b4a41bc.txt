Description:
Compounds that can react with acyl radicals to form benzylic radical intermediates.

This light requirement 
comes with serious disadvantages, such as known photodegradation of the lightsensing 
chromophore,23,24 as well as lightpenetration during process scaleupintensification.25 
Remarkably, some EREDs do not require light to access single electron chemistries with 
bromoacetophenones, generating reactive acyl radicals that have been shown to react with styrenes.26 
In the case of prochiral styrenes, such as methyl styrene, the benzylic radical intermediate formed after 
radical addition to the double bond is terminated via a highly enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer 
(HAT) from the FMN cofactor; however, larger substituents than methyl or ethyl have been reported to 
give only traces of conversion.26 Inspired by this reaction, we envisaged that radical addition to prochiral 
vinyl sulfides followed by enantioselective HAT would generate chiral thioethers (Figure 1E).
