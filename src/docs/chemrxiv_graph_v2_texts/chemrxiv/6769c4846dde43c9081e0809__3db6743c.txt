Description:
A receptor kinase involved in glucose homeostasis and metabolism.

Text:
IR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in 
several biochemical processes in mammalian cells, including glucose homeostasis and protein, 
carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. The IR is a homodimeric () glycoprotein composed of 
extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular parts. The binding of insulin to the extracellular 
part (ectodomain) brings about conformational changes that are subsequently transduced to the 
intracellular kinasesignaling domain.11 The dysfunction of the IR in humans has been linked to 
an increased risk of diabetes mellitus or cancer.12 The IR ectodomain is composed of multiple 
domains; leucinerich repeat domain (L1), cysteinerich region (CR), a second leucinerich repeat 
domain (L2), followed by three fibronectin type III domains (FnIII1, FnIII2, FnIII3).
