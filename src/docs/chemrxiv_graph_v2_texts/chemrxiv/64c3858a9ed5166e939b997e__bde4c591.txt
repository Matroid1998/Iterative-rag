Description:
An electronically conductive carbon material used in hybrid compounds with MnO2.

One of the most common 
approaches involves synthetizing hybrid compounds by combining MnO2 with electronically 
conductive carbon material such as carbon nanotube,16,17 carbon fiber,18,19 graphene20,21 or 
conductive polymer.22,23 Another interesting approach to boost the electronic conductivity is 
the elaboration of compositesnanocomposites MnO2conductive metal24 or MnO2transition 
metal oxides.25,26 Although these approaches improve overall conductivity, the intrinsic 
electronic conductivity of the birnessite phase remains unchanged and the performance of 
composite electrode materials heavily relies on achieving a homogeneous distribution between 
the electronic conductive phase and MnO2.26 To overcome this issue, it is possible to 
incorporate heteroatom into birnessite to change its electronic structure and reduce its electronic 
band gap.2730 For instance, Liu et al.
