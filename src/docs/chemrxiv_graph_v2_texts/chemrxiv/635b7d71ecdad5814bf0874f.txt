Description:
A tetradymite with multiple valence and conduction band pockets due to strong band inversion.

Text:
Band inversion gives rise to unique physical phenomena in topo
logical insulators, such as the quantum spin Hall effect and the
emergence of gapless surface states. 1 In the bulk, band inversion
can lead to highly warped, nonparabolic bands near the kpoint
at which the inversion occurs, where the concept of valley degen
eracy (i.e. number of carrier pockets available for charge carrier
transport) becomes important. In tetradymite Bi2Te3 for example,
multiple valence and conduction band pockets form around the
point due to strong band inversion. 27 The valley degeneracy
can have a crucial impact on the electrical transport properties
of a material.

Description:
A tetradymite system where spin-orbit coupling strength is largely responsible for band inversion.

Text:
First, it is not clear
whether warping occurs due to band inversion in systems other
than rocksalt materials, given our previous analysis was based
on a k  p model specifically for this system. 18 Second, the pro
posed mechanisms behind band inversion is inconsistent. While it
is generally believed that the spinorbit coupling (SOC) strength
is largely responsible for the degree to which bands are inverted
in systems such as tetradymite Bi2Te3, 1922 atomic orbital interac
tions (e.g. sp coupling) have been suggested as a significant con
