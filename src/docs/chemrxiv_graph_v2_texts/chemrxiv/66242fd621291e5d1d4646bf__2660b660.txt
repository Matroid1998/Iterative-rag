Involved in transition metal-catalyzed intramolecular annulations to form pyridines.

Text:
Transition metalcatalyzed intra
molecular 222 annulations13 by coupling two alkynes with ni
triles, which take advantage of using tethered diynes (Scheme 1B) to 
reduce the entropic penalty have been proven as an effective route 
to pyridines.14 Since the pioneering work of Wakatsuki and Yama
zaki on CpCo(I)catalyzed reactions,15 this cycloaddition has been 
extensively explored with the aid of various transition metal cata
lysts, including cobalt,16 nickel,17 iron,18 ruthenium,19 rhodium,20 and 
iridium,21 in addition to stoichiometric variants using exogenous 
metal additives. Relevant to this work, the intramolecular cyclization 
of two different alkynes could be achieved as well by tethering either 
the two alkynes or one alkyne with the nitrile moiety17b,18,20,21a,22 (Fig
ure 1B), thus allowing to control chemoselectivity.

Description:
Undergo electrochemical homo cyclotrimerizations to form arenes.

Text:
Recently, electrochemical transformations have 
undergone a renaissance,27 and in the context of this study, 222 
electrochemical homo cyclotrimerizations of alkynes to arenes have 
been explored recently (Figure 1D).28 We demonstrate here an in
termolecular cyclization strategy of alkynes and nitriles providing 
2,3,6trisubstituted pyridines via constantcurrent electrolysis using 
the combination of a catalytic amount of triphenylamine (TPA) and 
benzoic acid as a redox shuttle which obliviates the use of metals and 
other external additives (Figure 1E). The crosscyclization of two 
different alkynes is especially possible, being to the best of our 
knowledge, unprecedented. Moreover, a competitive alkyne 
222 cyclotrimerization is not observed. TPA
