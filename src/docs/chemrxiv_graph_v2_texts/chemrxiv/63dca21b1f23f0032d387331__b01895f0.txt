A chemical feedstock for fertilizer synthesis produced from aerial N2.

The artificial fixation of nitrogen by 
Haber and Bosch had ushered in sustenance of the 
everincreasing population by facilitating production 
of NH3 as a chemical feedstock for fertilizer synthesis 
from aerial N2 1. Although it is hailed as one of the 
greatest discoveries of mankind, over the past few 
decades researchers had invested their efforts to 
unearth 
more 
benign 
routes 
through 
solar, 
electrochemical for N2 conversion to NH3 2 as the 
commercial production of NH3 is associated with 
significant carbon footprint3. The inertness of N2 
poses an unassailable challenge to its fixation 
regardless of the fact that N2 conversion to NH3 is a 
thermodynamically feasible process (Gof (298 K) of 
NH3 (from N2 and H2) is 16.4 kJmol).

The primary product of electrochemical N2 fixation under mild conditions.

The nitrogenase model of N2 fixation has been 
thoroughly investigated and had inspired the 
development 
of 
several 
catalysts 
914. Unfortunately, most of these catalysts use sacrificial 
reductants. Of late the focus has shifted to achieve this 
singularly important transformation electrochemically 
as electricity produced from carbon neutral sources 
such as wind, solar or hydro will render it sustainable 
in the long run 15. Electrochemical N2 fixation has 
emerged as an alternative which holds the promise of 
achieving transformation of N2 to NH3 under mild 
conditions 1618. Instances of Nitrogen fixation yielding N2H4 as the 
major product as opposed to NH3 are scarce. Many 
NRR (Nitrogen Reduction Reaction) molecular 
catalysts form N2H4 as a side product, out of which Fe
