Description:
Undergoes O2 dissociative adsorption at exposed basal plane edges and defects.

Text:
We recently reported studies of O2 etching of individual carbon nanoparticles (NPs) in the 
temperature (TNP) range from 1200 to 2400 K, with several unexpected results.1, 2 O2 reaction 
with graphite in this temperature range proceeds by O2 dissociative adsorption at under
coordinated carbon sites (C), at exposed basal plane edges and defects,39 creating oxidized 
surface sites (C(O)) that can decay by desorption of oxygen, resulting in no net reaction, or by 
COCO2 desorption, etching the surface.10 The mechanisms are not as well established for other 
forms of carbon, but almost certainly involve O2 dissociative adsorption at undercoordinated 
sites, followed by desorption of oxygen or COx.
