Description:
A precious metal demonstrating utility in catalytic synthesis.

Text:
As such, considerable efforts have been devoted to 
their catalytic synthesis with precious metals, where palladium, 
rhodium, and iridium demonstrate the greatest utility.4 
Modern variations of Kumada5 and Suzuki reactions,6 
including photoredoxmediated,7 reductive,8 and redoxactive 
estermediated crosscouplings9 have demonstrated success in
