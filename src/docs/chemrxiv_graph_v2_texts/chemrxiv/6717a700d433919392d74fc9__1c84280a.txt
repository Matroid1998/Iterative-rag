Description:
Forms polarity-matched radicals used to activate carbon acids.

Text:
The use of a strong 
base for activation limited the substrate scope to compounds 
capable of turnover by the opposite process, electron transfer 
followed by proton transfer, which precluded the use of a 
hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) cocatalyst. FunezArdoiz and 
Ye 
reported 
an 
ingenious 
photoredox 
catalyzed 
hydroalkylation method using polaritymatched boryl radicals 
to activate carbon acids.6f Recently, Kobayashi reported 
Scheme 1. Methods for direct activation of C(sp3)H carbon acids to radical 
intermediates
