Description:
A key element involved in carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) for decarbonisation.

Text:
Substantial growth in coal demand was driven by 
developments in the power sector and switching from natural gas to coal, due to a 
significant surge in gas prices, in India, China and the European Union, despite 
substantial reductions in the United States 2. Therefore, the decarbonisation of coal
fired power plants is more critical now than ever. Implementation of carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS) is expected to provide a substantial driving force for the 
decarbonisation of the power sector, accounting for about 15 of cumulative CO2 
emission reductions by 2070 3. Solventbased chemical scrubbing technology is currently the technology of choice in 
power CCUS projects 4, as it has been commercially demonstrated 5.
