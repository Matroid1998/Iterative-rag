With global warming becoming increasingly visible around the world, it is now crucial 
29 
for every industry to tackle the challenges of reducing CO2 emissions. Responsible for around 
30 
8  of global CO2 emissions, the cement industry needs to drastically reduces its carbon 
31 
footprint. One solution is to substitute the clinker of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with 
32 
oxides of lower calcium content. These oxides inevitably have a lower reactivity than clinker 
33 
but if they contain enough calcium, it can be activated by an external source of alkalinity that 
34 
can be either a residual part of clinker or an added alkali activator. This latter case corresponds 
35 
to alkaliactivated cements13 made from clays or various industrial byproducts such as 
36 
groundgranulated blast furnace slag.
