Description:
Led to the formation of complex intractable mixtures when used in place of zinchydride.

, but also as aluminum is 
distinct from zinc in multiple ways (particularly in valency and coordination number of the NacNacMR12 complexes). If the same approach of coupling endergonic CH metalation (using a AlNR3 cation in this case) with exergonic 
dehydrocoupling also was successful with Al it would indicate broad (in terms of metal) scope. Initial attempts using NacNacAlH2 (7) in place of the zinchydride led to the formation of complex intractable mixtures. Therefore, the use of NacNacAlMe2 (8) was explored in place of 7. While NacNacZnEt was not viable in CH metalation, 
we hypothesized that the greater polarization of AlCalkyl bonds, relative to ZnCalkyl (based on  between M and C)20 
could lead to a lower barrier in any Alalkyl protonolysis step.
