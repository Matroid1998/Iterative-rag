Among these reactions, Michael addition 
is a widely used strategy to conjugate small molecules contain

rapid kinetics of these reactions has attracted considerable at
tention,59 two major drawbacks including the low chemoselec
tivity (see the Supporting Information for detailed chemoselec
tivity experiments on peptide models with maleimide and iodo
acetamide, Figure S63S73) and poor stability of the conjugated 
products in the presence of external thiols (like glutathione) 
plagued their applications in chemical biology (Figure 1a)8, 6061. Even recent progresses employing innovative Michael accep
tors with electrondeficient alkynes, including phosphon
amidate62 and diethynyl phosphinates63 have been explored, 
challenges in the stereo and regioselectivities, and the stability
