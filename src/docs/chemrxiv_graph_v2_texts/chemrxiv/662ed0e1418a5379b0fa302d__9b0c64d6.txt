into functional materials and biologically active molecules. INTRODUCTION 
Metalcatalyzed insertion of carbenes into CH bonds is a 
powerful method for the construction of complex organic 
molecules (Scheme 1).1,2 It is widely employed for the syn
thesis of natural compounds and latestage functionaliza
tion of biologically active molecules. Due to the develop
ment of various catalysts (most notably rhodium carbox
ylates and copper bis(oxazoline) complexes), such inser
tion reactions can be carried out with high regio and en
antioselectivity to obtain valuable chiral products.
