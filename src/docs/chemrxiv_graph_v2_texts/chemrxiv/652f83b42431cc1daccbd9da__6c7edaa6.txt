Description:
Form membrane-bound compartments under prebiotically plausible conditions.

Text:
Mixtures of singlechain amphiphiles (e.g., fatty acids, alco
hols, and aldehydes) form membranebound compartments un
der prebiotically plausible conditions.57 However, their sensi
tivity to metal ions8 restricts their ability to host Mg2driven 
RNA polymerisation9 and Fedriven protometabolic pro
cesses,10,11 and suggests that complex phospholipids were likely 
needed for the emergence of robust primitive cells.3,4 Notably, 
phospholipids enhance the stability of fatty acidbased mem
branes to pH and divalent cations,1214 but such blended mem
branes do not host the compositional diversity of phospholipids 
nor mirror the functional capabilities exhibited by modern 
membranes.

Description:
Components that, when activated with glycerol phosphates, contribute to the formation of phospholipids.

Text:
Only a few routes have been described for the prebiotic syn
thesis of phospholipids.15 For instance, activation of mixtures of 
fatty acids and glycerol phosphates gives rise to selfassembling 
(lyso)phosphatidic acids, the simplest of phospholipids.3,6,1618 
However, pathways leading to more complex phospholipids 
(e.g., phosphatidylcholines) remain scarce.
