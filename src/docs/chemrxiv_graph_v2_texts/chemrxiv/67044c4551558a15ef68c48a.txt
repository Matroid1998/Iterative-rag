Description:
Atoms are more polarizable than oxygen atoms.

However, substituting a sulfur for an oxygen atom in an 
acyltRNA could impact translation positively or negatively at multiple steps during, before, or after 
the translation cycle. Although thioesters are more reactive towards amine nucleophiles than oxo
esters,1,4 CS bonds are longer than CO bonds, and Satoms more polarizable than Oatoms; 
thiols and thioethers donate and accept Hbonds differently than alcohols,57 making the overall 
effect of sulfur substitution on ribosomal protein synthesis challenging to predict.
