Description:
Used as a catalyst in carbene migratory insertion cross-coupling sequences.

Text:
This process has been successful for alkylation, arylation 
and alkynylation, but no report of alkenylation has 
appeared to the best of our knowledge.5 Recently, there 
was a strong interest in using cheaper copper catalysts 
to achieve carbene migratory insertioncrosscoupling 
sequences (Figure 1C).2b However, the final step is often 
protodemetallation, resulting in less substituted 
products. The coupling with alkynes gave C(sp)C(sp3) 
bonds.8,4b Arenes and especially heterocycles bearing 
acidic proton were also suitable coupling partners.9 All
