Description:
Formed from the reduction of lipid peroxides by GPX4.

Text:
In general, enzymes that are involved in 
H2O2 production, the oxidation of phospholipids andor 
accumulation of Fe2 in cells contribute to ferroptotic cell 
death, whereas enzymes that inhibit lipid oxidation, reduce 
lipid peroxides andor remove Fe2 protect cells from 
ferroptosis.3 A central node of the ferroptotic pathway is 
GPX4.4,5 This antioxidant enzyme reduces lipid peroxides 
to the corresponding alcohols through an interplay be
tween the activesite selenocysteine and the cofactor gluta
thione (GSH).6 The induced global deletion of Gpx4 in mice 
causes acute renal failure and associated death.5 Apart 
from renal failure, ferroptosis has been implicated in a 
variety of tissue7 and organ injuries810 as well as neuro
degenerative,11,12 cardiovascular,13 inflammatory14 and 
infectious diseases.15 A key connection was uncovered 
between the progression of ischemia reperfusion (IR)
inducedacute organ damage and ferroptotic cell death in 
the lungs, heart, liver and intestinal tract has been exten
sively studied and validated in animal models.5,8,9,13 Re
markably, the pharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis 
with radical trapping antioxidants (RTAs)16 protect against 
synchronizing kidney tubular cell death in both severe IR
induced injury as well as oxalate crystalinduced models 
of acute kidney injury.17 These ferroptosis inhibitors have 
also shown beneficial effects in models for brain injuries 
and neurodegenerative disorders,18 such Parkinsons dis
ease,19 Huntingtons disease7 and hemorrhagic stroke.20 
Several natural RTAs have been identified as anti
ferroptotic defense mechanisms, such as vitamin E (e.g.
