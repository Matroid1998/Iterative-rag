Description:
Organic compounds that can be oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase enzyme.

Moreover, it is proved by several researches that the 
enzymelike activity of the nanozymes can be inhibited by some inhibitors as same as the 
native enzymes. It is inhibitory effect can be used for several aims especially for sensing 
and detection toward developing both clinical and analytical protocols 2630. It is well 
known that among different identified enzymes, peroxidase enzymes, especially 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP), are attractive enzymes from both industrial and clinical 
points of view 28. Regarding the peroxidase enzymes, hydrogen peroxide is the initiator 
of the peroxidasemediated reactions and the oxidation of a wide range of organic 
compounds (substrates) including aromatic amines, phenols, and their mixtures can be 
initiated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase enzyme 28.
