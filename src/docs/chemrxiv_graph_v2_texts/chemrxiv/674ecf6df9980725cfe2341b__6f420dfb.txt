Description:
A product of CO2 reduction in microdroplet-catalyzed transformations.

Text:
The physicochemical environment of aqueous microdroplets is distinct from bulk water, which can be exploited to accelerate
reactions or even enable otherwise unfeasible transformations.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 Recent examples of microdropletcatalyzed transforma
tions include the acceleration of the Menshutkin,8,9 DielsAlder,10,11,12, and AzaMichael reactions,13 as well as CO2 reduction
to formic acid.14,15
Deciphering the factors that are responsible for the intriguing catalytic effect observed is a nontrivial task, in part due to the
transient nature of microdroplets and because of their fairly small reaction volumes. At the same time, the size of microdroplets
