Description:
An antifungal drug used to manage infections, though resistance is increasing.

Text:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has lived in the background of public health for many years; however, 
resistant infections are now on track to become the leading cause of death within the next few decades. 2019 
saw an estimated 4.95 million AMRassociated deaths,1 and this number is expected to rise rapidly in the 
coming years fueled also by the indiscriminate overprescription of antibiotics during the COVID19 
pandemic.2 Furthermore, treatment of COVID19 and HIVAIDS often leave patients immunocompromised 
and therefore highly susceptible to fungal infections.3 This is of particular concern in SubSaharan Africa 
where cryptococcal meningitis accounted for 19  of AIDSrelated deaths in 2020.4 While most infections 
can be managed with current antifungal drugs  polyenes, flucytosine, azoles and echinocandins  resistance 
is increasing and the development of new antifungal therapies has stalled.
