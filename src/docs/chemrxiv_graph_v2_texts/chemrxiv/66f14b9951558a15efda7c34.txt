A solvent used in the incorporation of ligands into crystals.

of a bidentate ligand into PNCcH2OCovTPP. This was readily achieved by adding 
4,4bipyridyl into the methanol solvent in contact with the crystals with 100 incorporation of the 
walltie ligands into the cavity to give PNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP as confirmed by scXRD. Removal of included solvent from these crystals to give did not result in loss of order and only a slight 
reduction in unit cell volume (0.4). Nitrogen adsorption analysis at 77K of PUNCvTPPCocbipy
CovTPP showed significant uptake at low relative pressure to give a typical Type 1 isotherm shape 
consistent with a microporous material (Fig. 5a). This data was used to calculate a BrunauerEmmett
Teller surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g1.

Description:
A solvent used for the incorporation of metal cations into porous structures.

Text:
Notably, the CO2 uptake for PUNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP is significantly 
higher than that of PUNCCocbipyCo, which is consistent with the increase in ultramicroporosity 
due to the included TPP increasing the length of the narrow interconnecting channels from 9  to 
15 , as measured from the scXRD structure. The resulting permanently porous PUNCvTPPCo
cbipyCovTPP possesses metalfree porphyrins suitable for metal cation incorporation via post
synthetic modification. Hence the crystals were exposed to a methanol solution of CuCl2 and the 
successful insitu incorporation of Cu2 to give PNCvTPPCuCocbipyCovTPPCu was confirmed 
by scXRD, which showed that the resulting CuCo distance is only 3.51 . Similarly, Co2 could be 
introduced into the TPP by exposure to a solution of CoCl2 to produce PNCvH2OCoTPPCocbipy
CovTPPCoOH2 with a CoCo distance of 3.52 .
