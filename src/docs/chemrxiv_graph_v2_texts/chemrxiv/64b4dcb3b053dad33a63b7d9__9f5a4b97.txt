Description:
Products of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 using copper as a catalyst.

Text:
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals using renewable 
electricity offers a promising approach to sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. In 
1985, Hori et al. discovered Cus unique catalytic activity in electrochemically reducing CO2 
to hydrocarbons.1 Later, in 2012, Kuhl et al. found that copper under CO2 reduction 
conditions could produce at least 16 different products including CO, C1, C2, and C3 
products.2 However, the nature of the formation of this extensive range of products has been a 
subject of intense debate. Unraveling this mystery is critical to the designing of a reaction 
system with superior efficiency and selectivity towards desired products.
