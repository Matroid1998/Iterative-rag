Description:
The gatekeeper to the PMIs class, not commercially available and somewhat difficult to make, especially on a large scale.

They lack the directional charge transfer excitation and
high Stokes shifts required for example in photocatalysis, solar technologies and bioimaging. Perylenemonoimides (PMIs)  the nonsymmetric equivalent of PDIs  combine the typical
features of PDIs with the additional characteristics of DonorAcceptor compounds.5 Despite
the somewhat complementary nature of PDIs and PMIs, literature reports 5800 distinct
PDIs derivatives described in over 10000 papers and only 293 PMIs dyes in 334 papers. Such striking overrepresentation of PDIs does not exclusively stem from performances but is
also the consequence of a more synthetically challenging preparation. Perylenedicarboxylic
monoahydride PDCMA is the gatekeeper to the PMIs class. Unlike PTCDA, it is not com
mercially available and somewhat difficult to make, especially on a large scale.
