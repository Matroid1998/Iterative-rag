Description:
A non-Noyori type pyridine-based catalyst involved in metalligand cooperativity.

Text:
The cismotif was accessed through an atypical mode 
of metalligand cooperative H2 activation by the key intermedi
ate (2) that has unusual coordination chemistry that adds to the 
developing story of aromatizationdearomatization metallig
and cooperativity (MLC) in catalytic cycles (Figure 1).7,8,9 Fur
thermore, the reversible photochemistry from 3 enabled pho
toswitchable H2 production from various alcohols using very 
mild reagents and conditions (r.t., l  345 nm). The mechanism 
and catalysis is a unique example of a photoswitchable H2 gen
eration strategy with demonstrated application in the important 
area of acceptorless MLC alcohol dehydrogenation.1013
