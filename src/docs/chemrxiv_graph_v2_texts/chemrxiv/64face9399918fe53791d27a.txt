Description:
A metallic material used to prepare catalytic MNMs.

Text:
Moreover, the motility of MNMs in the presence of different chemicals can be used as a gauge 
to estimate relative levels of contamination.5,6 A chemical modification of the outer surface 
of MNMs with a selfassembled monolayer of a hydrophobic compound allows capture, 
transport and removal of oil droplets from contaminated water.7,8 Several different 
materials have been investigated to prepare catalytic MNMs, most of which are metallic, such 
as platinum, silver, magnesium, iridium etc.913 Examples of metal oxides for the 
preparation of MNMs are rather rare. Wang et al.
