Description:
Molecules generated by substituting hydrogen atoms in benzene with halogen atoms.

Text:
The example shown in Figure 1 is a template for the generation of halo
substituted benzenes. The six halogen atom substitution sites are labelled as a, b, c, d, e and f. This 
template can be manually constructed by hand from scratch or by editing a Zmatrix from a molecular 
60 
graphic software such as IQmol. For complicated molecules, it would be easier to draw or import the 
structure in such a program before manual manipulation. IQmol can help us visually identify the 
atom numbers corresponding to desired substitution sites by using Display  Atom Labels  Index.
