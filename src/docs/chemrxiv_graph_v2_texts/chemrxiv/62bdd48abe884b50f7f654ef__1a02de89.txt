Description:
Studied for its decomposition at lithium surfaces using ab initio molecular dynamics.

Text:
To the best of our
knowledge there is no systematic study so far on the decom
position and the formation of different possible products for
varying LiIL ratios employing electronic structure methods. Previous computational studies mainly used ab initio molec
ular dynamics to study the decomposition of (BMP)TFSI at
lithium surfaces.1922 In theses studies different decomposi
tion products were found, including large fragments, such as
NSO2CF3,19,20,22 but also solely atomic constituents,21 de
pending on the length of the simulation. In the present study
we use both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and
xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate possible
products of the reaction
