Description:
Compounds with a distinctive advantage in chemical synthesis.

Text:
Additionally, we envisaged that iterative defluorination of these 
phosphinates could provide monofluoromethyl ketones and me
thyl ketones, enabling stepwise access to less fluorinated deriv
atives. A distinctive advantage of difluoroenol phosphinates is
