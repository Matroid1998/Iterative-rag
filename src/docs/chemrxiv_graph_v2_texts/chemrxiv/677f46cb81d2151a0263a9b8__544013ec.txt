Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.

Text:
In addition, methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas with a 
potential to contribute to global warming approximately 25 times greater than carbon dioxide 
(CO2) over the next one hundred year.11 Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover lowcarbon 
footprint methods to selectively convert methane to transportable highenergydensity liquid fuels 
and valueadded chemical feedstocks. Although methane conversion pathways are desirable, the technologies are not yet 
competitive to petroleumbased production of chemicals and fuels. Industrially, methane 
conversion could be realized in large scale through steam methane reforming to produce syngas,12 
a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H2), which was then used as feedstocks in 
the FischerTropsch synthesis process13, 14 to generate liquid hydrocarbons.
