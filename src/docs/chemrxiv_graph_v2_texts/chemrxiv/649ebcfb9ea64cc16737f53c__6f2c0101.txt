Description:
A compound whose protonation and N-alkylation allow control of charge transfer, emission energy, and photoluminescence quantum yield.

Charge transfer in organic fluorophores is a fundamental photophysical process that can be either 
beneficial, e.g., facilitating thermally activated delayed fluorescence,1, 2 or detrimental, e.g., mediating 
emission quenching.3 It has been previously shown that both protonation4 and Nalkylation5, 6 of 
quinoline containing compounds allows straightforward synthetic control of the charge transfer, 
emission energy and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (Scheme 1a), with the effect of 
alkylation mirroring those of protonation while being necessarily more permanent.5 Control of 
photoluminescence and photophysical properties in organic molecules has significant appeal for a 
range of applications from organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) to biological imaging and sensing.

Description:
Compounds whose protonation and N-alkylation significantly affect charge transfer states.

Text:
Given the importance of the charge transfer (CT) process in influencing key photophysical parameters 
developing structureactivity relationships (SARs) to describe CT formation will be of interest to a wide 
range of stakeholders. In medicinal chemistry the development of SARs is standard practice, but a 
similarly detailed understanding of the structural properties controlling charge transfer has yet to be 
fully developed. Since protonation and Nalkylation have a significant and predictable effect on CT 
states in quinolinecontaining compounds these provide a good starting point for exploring these vital 
fundamental processes and developing effective SARs. One prominent set of quinoline containing compounds are the cinchona alkaloids, in particular the 
historically important antimalarial quinine.
