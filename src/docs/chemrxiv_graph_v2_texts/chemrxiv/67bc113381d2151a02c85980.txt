Description:
Ions that move and are stored in electrodes within lithium-ion batteries.

Also, LIBs serve as the main energy source for an increasing number 
of electric cars and portable electronics.1 While research in LIBs have progressed to a great 
extent, the basic idea for the research remains the same decrease in the size of the battery, 
making the battery affordable and safe to use, and to increase the cyclic durability.2 Typically, 
an anode, a cathode, a porous separating membrane and an electrolyte form the constituents of 
an LIB. The electrodes (cathode and anode) facilitate the movement and storage of the lithium 
ions through the conducting electrolyte. The porous separating membrane acts as a physical 
barrier to avoid contact between the cathode and anode while allowing movement of ions to 
prevent thermal runway.
