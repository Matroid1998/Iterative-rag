Description:
Participates in the catalytic mechanism of class B lactamases.

Text:
One particular case is the Ala294Pro295 deletion found in the R2 
loop of E. cloacaes AmpC Ent385 lactamase, which increases the efficiency in 
hydrolyzing ceftazidime over 1,000 fold, compared to AmpC without this deletion, as 
found in AmpC P99.6 

lactamases can be classified into four classes, A, B, C, and D (Ambler 
classification), according to their sequence similarity and catalytic mechanism of action.7,8 
Classes A, C and D function by a serine ester hydrolysis mechanism, whereas class B 
lactamases have zinc ions participating in catalysis.8 Compared to the class A and D 
serine lactamases, the detailed hydrolysis mechanism of class C lactamases, also
