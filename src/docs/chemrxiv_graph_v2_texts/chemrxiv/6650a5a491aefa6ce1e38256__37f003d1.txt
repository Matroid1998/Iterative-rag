Description:
Complex lipids that are abundant in human blood products.

Text:
However, direct application of RPC in the analysis of human blood 
products is challenging in practice due to the abundance of protein and complex lipids such as 
glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols. Proteins are removed by organic solvent precipitation13,14 
allowing their separation by centrifugation or filtering from the small moleculecontaining 
supernatant. Lipids are strongly retained under RPC conditions and highly ionizable in electrospray 
ionization (ESI). Consequently, complex and neutral lipid species can accumulate in the LC system 
during analyses of lowmolecularweight metabolites (LMWMs) in blood products, eluting 
unpredictably from the column and exhibiting suppressive effects on the ionization of other 
metabolites1519.
