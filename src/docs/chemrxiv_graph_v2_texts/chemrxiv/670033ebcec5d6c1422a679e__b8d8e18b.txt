An irreducible lithium binary phase.

not further reducible. Examples of irreducible phases are lithium binaries (e.g. Li2S, LiCl, LiBr, 
43 
Li2O, Li3N), lithiumrich antiperovskites (e.g. Li3OCl, Li3OBr; see refs. 14,15), Li5NCl2 (refs. 16,17 ) and 
44 
the recently discovered Li2xS1xPx (0x0.75) solid solution. 18 An issue with irreducible phases 
45 
thus far has been that their ambienttemperature conductivities do not typically reach values 
46 
above 0.05 mS cm1 Li3N and Li2.75S0.25P0.75 are exceptions with RT conductivities of 0.5 mS cm1 
47 
(ref. 19) and 0.25 mS cm1 (ref. 18), respectively. The latter Li2xS1xPx (0x0.75) solid solution 18 
48 
is characterized by a disordered anion lattice, yet the effect of the structural disorder on ion 
49 
conductivity has not yet been clarified.
