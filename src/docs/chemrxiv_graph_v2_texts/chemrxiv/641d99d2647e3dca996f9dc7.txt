Description:
In rocksalt ZnO, oxygen is in an octahedral environment, allowing for the introduction of a variety of cations.

Text:
At ambient conditions ZnO has hexagonal wurtzite (w) structure (space group P63mc) which 
transforms into cubic rocksalt (rs) structure (space group Fm3m) at pressures above 6 GPa 1. 
rsZnO and ZnObased cubic solid solutions with different ions seem to be promising for 
optoelectronic and spintronics applications due to ability to incorporate much higher dopants 
concentrations as compared with the wurtzite phase. The octahedral oxygen environment in rock
salt ZnO removes the crystallochemical limitations for the introduction of a variety of cations. Hence, the properties of the solid solution can be tuned over a wide range of dopant concentrations 
while remaining within the field of its phase stability.
