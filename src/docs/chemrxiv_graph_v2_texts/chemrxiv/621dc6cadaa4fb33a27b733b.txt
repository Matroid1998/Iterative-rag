Description:
A one-carbon compound used as a raw material in C1 chemistry.

Text:
C1 chemistry is a field of industrial organic chemistry that applies oneC compounds such as CO, CO2, 
CH4, and CH3OH as the raw materials for transformation reactions, which involve the interconversions 
of C1 compounds andor CC bond formation reactions, to produce compounds with two or more Cs.1 
Among the oneC compounds, halogenated compounds play essential roles in C1 chemistry because 
of their high reactivities.
