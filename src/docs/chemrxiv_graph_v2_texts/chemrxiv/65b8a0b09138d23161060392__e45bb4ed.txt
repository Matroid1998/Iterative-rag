Description:
Forms the skeleton of graphene oxide.

Text:
Graphene oxide (GO) is a promising twodimensional (2D) material with high specific 
surface area. As a graphene derivate, its carbon skeleton is decorated with oxygen 
functionalities, which largely limits its electrical conductivity and application in 
electrochemical energy storage, especially in supercapacitors.
