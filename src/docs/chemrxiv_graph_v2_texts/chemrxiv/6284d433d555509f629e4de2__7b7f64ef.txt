Description:
Catalyzes Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions.

Despite this,
there are very few publicly available and easily operable datasets of chemical reactions with
associated yields (Table S1). One of those few public datasets is the United State Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO) dataset,8 that covers a wide range of chemical reactions
extracted from patents. USPTO data is extremely diverse and suffers from a selection bias
as only successful reactions tend to be reported in patents. ML has shown poor performance
predicting yields on this dataset (R2  0.2)7. In addition, two sets of High Throughput
Experimentation (HTE) data, one of a SuzukiMiyaura coupling,9 and one of a palladium
catalyzed BuchwaldHartwig crosscoupling,10 are available in the literature.
