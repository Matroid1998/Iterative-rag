Description:
A component in lead-free perovskite structures with high power conversion efficiency.

Text:
Within the perovskitestructured subclass of these materials, ionic substitution is employed as a design 
principle, replacing Pb with a combination of chemicallysimilar cations.7 Among these novel leadfree 
perovskites developed over the last decade, titaniumbased vacancyordered double perovskites 
(VODPs)(Cs2TiX6; X  I, Br, Cl) have attracted particular attention following the recent demonstration of high 
performance in solar cell devices, with 3.38 power conversion efficiency  the current best performance for a 
Sn and Pbfree perovskite structure. The elemental abundance of Ti9 and its low toxicity10 make it a viable 
replacement for Pb. Beyond photovoltaic applications, the A2BX6 structural family exhibit features associated with both zero
dimensional and threedimensional materials (such as low thermal conductivity,11 high compressibility and
