Description:
Has a molar mass corresponding to 5060 Al atoms for MAO.

75 of total Me3Al content for the sample in question).20 The 
same study suggested a roughly spherical shape for bulk MAO 
based upon rg  9.3 and rH 11.7  as measured by SANS and 
PGSE NMR, respectively. Both estimates were in good 
agreement with earlier studies of T1 relaxation (rg  9.7 )21 and 
metallocene ionpair size (rH  1212.5 ) by PGSE NMR.22 
However, interpretation of the PGSE NMR data in terms of 
aluminoxane molar mass (5060 Al atoms for MAO20 vs. 150
200 Al atoms for the ionpair22) differed significantly between 
the two studies.
