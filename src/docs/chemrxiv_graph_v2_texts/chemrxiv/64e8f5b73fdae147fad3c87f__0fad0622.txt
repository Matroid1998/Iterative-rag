Description:
Thought to substitute for the M2 sites with the extra charge balanced by intercalated anions.

Highactivity perovskite

oxides also involve active Fe sites14. La1xSrxCoO3 perovskites form CoOxHy layers in 
56 
alkaline electrolyte with enhanced activity in the presence of tracelevel Fe electrolyte 
57 
species15. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 undergoes surface reconstruction and transforms to OER
58 
active CoFe oxyhydroxides16. In fact, Fecontaining (oxy)hydroxides are ubiquitous for 
59 
OERactive materials including transitionmetal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and 
60 
phosphides1719. 61 
Typically NiFe and CoFe hydroxides adopt structures analogous to phase 
62 
Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2, which consist of layers of M(OH)6 octahedra with rotational 
63 
disorder and waterions intercalated into the interlayer space2023. The Fe3 is thought to 
64 
substitute for the M2 sites with the extra charge balanced by intercalated anions24.

Description:
Found under OER conditions in codeposited NiFe or CoFe (oxy)hydroxides.

Prior to 
65 
OER, Fedoped M(OH)2 is oxidized to (nominally) MOOH, accompanied by a 
66 
contraction of the MO bond length and interlayer distance, consistent with stronger MO 
67 
bonds upon formal cation oxidation25. Fe substitution induces a positive shift of the 
68 
apparent M2M3 redox potential, indicative of electronic interactions between Fe and host 
69 
Ni or Co cations. The oxidation state of Fe during OER at the active site remains a point 
70 
of discussion. Both Fe3 and Fe4 were found under OER conditions for codeposited Ni
71 
Fe or CoFe (oxy)hydroxides, while in nonaqueous electrolyte Fe6 was identified and 
72 
invoked as the active intermediate2629.
