Description:
Has a dia topology and is closely related to the novel allotrope BCTC20.

Text:
The structure was found with srs topology (SACADA 
No.5 9) representing trigonal carbon in a 3D crystal build, i.e., versus G planar trigonal 
carbon in G2D approach, as discussed above. Consequently, the interconnections of the two 
trigonallike carbon substructures lead to the tetrahedral structure as shown in this example. Based on these observations aiming to extend the approach trigonal 2D carbon  
tetrahedral 3D carbon to trigonal 3D carbon  tetrahedral 3D carbon transformations, a 
novel allotrope BCTC20 is proposed herein with dia topology, close to diamond in all its
