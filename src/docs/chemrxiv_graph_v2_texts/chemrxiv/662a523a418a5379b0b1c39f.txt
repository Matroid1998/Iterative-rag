Description:
Involved in the selectivity and conductance of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs).

Text:
The heterogenous enzyme en
vironment, including protein residues and solvent molecules,
generate a nonuniform electric field in active sites that facil
itates catalysis.1822 Simulations also showed that structural
dynamics cause wide fluctuations of the electric field in en
zymatic active sites, which further accelerate reactions rates,
thereby directly linking electrostatics and conformational mo
tion effects.2325 Finally, theoretical studies demonstrate that
electric fields could be used as a design principle to improve
the catalytic performance of synthetic enzymes and explain
the mutations selected by directed evolution.2629

electric fields can also explain drug
receptor binding and selectivity15,3133, unidirectional elec
tron transfer15,34, protonation states35 and metal ion chelation
in polymeric systems.36 In this paper, we propose a new ap
plication and calculate electric fields to unveil the molecular
mechanisms at the origin of the selectivity and conductance of
voltagegated sodium channel (Navs).

Description:
Ions permeate with water through the pore domain of Nav channels.

Text:
We use these electric
field calculations to investigate electrostatic preorganization
in Navs. Navs are responsible for the generation and propagation of
electrical signals in excitable cells such as neurons and mus
cle cells.3739 Navs comprise four domains, each consisting of
six helices, aligned across the cell membrane (Figure 1).40,41
Helices S1 through S4 of each domain further arrange into
the voltage sensing domain (VSD). S4 and its gating charge
residues can slide in and out of the membrane upon external
stimulation, triggering channel gating. Helices S5 and S6 of
each domain make the pore domain (PD), where sodium ions
permeate with water. S5 is connected to S6 by two additional
loops as well as the selectivity filter.
