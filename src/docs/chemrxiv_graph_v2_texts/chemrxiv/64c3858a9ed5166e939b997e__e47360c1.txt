Description:
A compound formed by incorporating Fe into MnO2, with a reduced electronic band gap of 0.62 eV and enhanced specific capacity.

have demonstrated through first principle calculations that 
a partial substitution of Mn34 by Fe3 in the metal oxide layer reduces the electronic band gap 
from 1.03 eV to 0.62 eV (for 33 mol of substitution) and enhances the specific capacity when 
compared to MnO2 at equivalent chargingdischarging rates.31 However, some aspects related 
to Fe incorporation into MnO2 (FeMnO2) still require clarification. The commonly used low
temperature synthesis, aiming at achieving nanostructuration, results in birnessite phases with 
poor crystallinity, limiting detailed structural investigations of the localization of Fe and its 
impact on the interlayer site (prismatic or octahedral). Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms 
in FeMnO2 during cycling remain unknown due to the potential redox activity of both Fe and 
Mn elements 31,32.
