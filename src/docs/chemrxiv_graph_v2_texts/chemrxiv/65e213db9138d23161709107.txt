Description:
Forms a metastable liquid crystalline mesophase which hinders the crystallization process.

Text:
Recently, Abdelsamie et al.12 studied 
the role of donor crystallization pathways and dynamics. They proposed that pDTS(FBTTh2)2 
forms a metastable liquid crystalline mesophase which hinders the crystallization process, and the 
ease of crystallization is linked with the solvent additives. Additionally the Tg of pDTS(FBTTh2)2 
has been estimated to be between 35 and 50 C using rapid heatcool (RHC) differential scanning
