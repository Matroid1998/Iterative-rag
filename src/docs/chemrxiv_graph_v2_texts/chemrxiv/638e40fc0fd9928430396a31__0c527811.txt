Description:
Used as a plasma source for depositing InN and as a thermal source for growing AlN and GaN.

Text:
Plasma ALD has successfully been used to deposit InN with both N2 57 and NH3 8 
plasma together with TMI at temperatures below the thermal decomposition of InN. Precursors with chelating ligands forming NIn bonds have also been used successfully to 
deposit InN with NH3 plasma.9,10 However, a thermal ALD process has not been shown 
experimentally. This is in contrast to the other group 13N semiconductors AlN and GaN 
which both has been grown using thermal NH3 and trimethyl aluminum (TMA, Al(CH3)3) 
11,12 and trimethyl gallium (TMG, Ga(CH3) 3) 13,14 respectively.

Description:
A molecule that is stable during ALD processes due to slow decomposition kinetics.

Text:
Since plasma ALD of InN gives films with TMI, and since the plasma discharge is 
not activated when TMI is exposed to the NHx covered InN surface, it is reasonable to 
assume that the limitation to a thermal ALD process for InN is found in the interaction 
between NH3 and the In(CH3)x covered InN surface. Although it is thermodynamically 
favorable for NH3 to decompose into N2 and H2 at the temperatures in the ALD processes, 
the decomposition is limited by very slow kinetics at these temperatures, making NH3 
stable during the residence time in ALD.15 The majority of the NH3 molecules are therefore
