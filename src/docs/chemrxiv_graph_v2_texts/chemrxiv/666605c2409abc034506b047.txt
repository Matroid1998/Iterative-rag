Description:
Aglycones originating from a benzaanthracene framework synthesized through the polyketide pathway.

Text:
Their aglycones, referred to as 
angucyclinones, originate from a benzaanthracene framework synthesized through the polyketide pathway 8,10. They collectively constitute the most extensive category of natural products derived from a type II polyketide 
synthase (PKS), boasting over 400 identified members, approximately 45 of which exhibit biological activity11. Many of the compounds acts have antimicrobial andor anticancer activity; however, many other bioactivities 
have been described, such as vasodilator, glutamate receptor agonist, platelet aggregation inhibitor or 
antidiabetic 8 A major reason for the strong interest in the angucyclines is the occurrence of highly diverse 
chemical scaffolds, whereby over a hundred different compounds may be produced by the same Streptomyces 
strain7,12.
