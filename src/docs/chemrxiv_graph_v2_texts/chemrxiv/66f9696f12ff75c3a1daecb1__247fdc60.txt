Description:
A high-pressure corundum-type metastable rhombohedral polymorph of In2O3.

Text:
Recently, a subgroup  of the  polymorph was discovered.14,15
This dierentiation was accompanied by the reinterpretation of the originally identied or
thorhombic structure16 to be a hexagonal structure,17 while the  subgroup has orthorhom
bic symmetry. Similarly, pronounced polymorphism is also reported for indium oxide. It
is possible to grow highquality singlecrystalline In2O3 in the stable bodycentered cubic
(bcc) bixbyite phase, named bccIn2O3 or In2O3.18,19 The existence of a highpressure
corundumtype metastable rhombohedral (rh) polymorph known as rhIn2O3 or In2O3 is
also documented.20 Moreover, the orthorhombic phases 1, 2, and 3In2O3 have also been
discussed in literature.2,2123
