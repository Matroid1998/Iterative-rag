Description:
A gas that is chemically stable and can withstand corrosive environments.

Text:
It also demonstrates a high chemical 
stability11 to withstand corrosive gases such as hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3), 
triethylboron (TEB, B(C2H5)3) or silane (SiH4) typically applied as precursors in 
CVD. The low electrical resistivity 7.0  106 .cm12 of ZrB2 as well as high 
reflectivity and low absorption between 5 and 6 eV 13 makes it promising as electrical 
contact for UVdevices. A further benefit is that epitaxial ZrB2 films can be deposited 
by direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS) on the substrates typically applied in 

3 
CVD of sp2BN films, i.e. Al2O3(0001)14 and 4HSiC(0001)15,16.
