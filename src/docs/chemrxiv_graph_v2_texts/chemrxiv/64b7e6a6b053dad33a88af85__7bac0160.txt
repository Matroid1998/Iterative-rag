Description:
A binary mixture from which C2H4 can be purified using imide-linked COFs.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class 
of organic porous crystalline materials based on light elements 
interconnected through covalent bonds.2125 Attributed to their 
predictable structures, high porosity, tunable pore sizes and 
high chemical stability, COFs have shown unique properties 
and great potential in gas storage and separation applica
tions.2630 Many experiments have been devoted to purity 
C2H4 from C2gases mixtures. In 2018, Zhu and coworkers 
used imidelinked COFs (PAF110) to purity C2H4 from bina
ry C2H2C2H4 mixtures.31 Recently, our group reported that 
threedimensional (3D) COFs with bcu topology could effi
ciently remove C2H6 from binary C2H2C2H4 mixtures to pro
duce polymergrade C2H4.
