Description:
Substrates for dehalogenation reactions catalyzed by haloalkane dehalogenases.

Text:
In this work, we studied the fate of selected bromo and bromochloroalkanes in the active 
site of two haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs), LinB and DhaA. The dehalogenation reaction 
that these two enzymes catalyze is of prime importance from the environmental perspective as 
it leads to less toxic compounds, products of the halogen substitutions (Scheme 1). The 
dehalogenation by these two HLDs comprises two consecutive steps. The first one is a SN2 
reaction where a carboxylate group of the enzyme acts as a nucleophile and attacks a halogen
bearing carbon atom, yielding a halide and a reactantenzyme intermediate. This ester 
intermediate is then subsequently hydrolyzed by a neighboring water molecule, restoring the 
enzyme and yielding the product alcohol.1
