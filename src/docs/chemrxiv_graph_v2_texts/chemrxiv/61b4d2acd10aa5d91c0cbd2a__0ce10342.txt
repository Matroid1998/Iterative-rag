Description:
A form of vitamin D whose deficiency can lead to a weakened immune system, rickets, and osteomalacia.

Text:
Vitamin D (1, VitD) was identified in the early 20th century as one of the essential molecules of 
the diet to support human life. A deficiency of VitD3 (4, Figure 1A) can result in a range of 
maladies such as a weakened immune system, rickets and osteomalacia.1 The structure of VitD3 
was first elucidated by Windaus and Thiele in 1936 building on the findings of Askew et al. who 
demonstrated that VitD2 (5) could be derived from irradiation of ergosterol.2 Radiolabeling studies 
established the most active form of VitD in the body to be calcitriol (6). From 19651975, 
foundational pharmacological studies established the basic role that VitD plays in regulating serum 
calcium and phosphorus and bone homeostasis.
