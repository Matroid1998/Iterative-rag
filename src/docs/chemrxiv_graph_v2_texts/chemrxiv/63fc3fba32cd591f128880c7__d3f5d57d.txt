Description:
The anatase type is more stable in nanoparticles smaller than approximately 14 nm due to lower surface energy.

TiO2, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or Titania, is a transition metal oxide material commonly used 
as a catalyst in various industrial applications due to its abundance and low cost 17. Over the past fifty years, 
the catalytic activity of TiO2 has been extensively studied. TiO2 has two main crystal structures, the rutile type 
(RTiO2) and the anatase type (ATiO2). While bulk rutile is the most thermodynamically stable crystalline 
phase of TiO2 8, the difference in free energy between RTiO2 and ATiO2 is relatively small 9. TiO2 
nanoparticles with a size smaller than approximately 14 nm are more stable in the anatase form due to the lower 
surface energy of the anatase planes 1014.
