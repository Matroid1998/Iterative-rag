Description:
A concentrated, strongly basic solution used at room temperature.

Text:
Many of the modified 
nucleotides are sensitive to such conditions, and thus ONs containing them cannot be synthesized using 
known synthesis methods. Some existing methods could be considered for the synthesis of ONs containing sensitive nucleotides. However, all of them have limitations. For example, using the phenoxyacetyl based groups for amino 
protection, ON deprotection can be achieved under milder conditions than using typical acyl groups. However, the conditions such as dilute sodium methoxide in methanol and concentrated ammonium 
hydroxide at room temperature are still strongly basic and nucleophilic.9 Using cleavable linkers based on 
nitro benzyl groups, ON cleavage can be achieved under nonnucleophilic and nonbasic photolytic 
conditions.
