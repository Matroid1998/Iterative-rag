Description:
Forms allotropes with mechanical properties similar to diamond, including extreme hardness.

Text:
Carbon allotropes that exhibit mechanical properties similar to those of diamond, in particular, 
extreme hardness, continue to be a subject of significant interest within the scientific community. Both the predominant cubic diamond and the less common hexagonal form (lonsdaleite) 
exhibit ultrahardness due to the threedimensional arrangement of C4 tetrahedra with purely 
sp3hybridization of the carbon atoms. In terms of topology, cubic and hexagonal diamonds are 
the aristotypes, designated as dia and lon, respectively 1. This nomenclature is also applicable 
to other families of carbon allotropes. The introduction of additional carbon atoms results in 
alterations to the C(sp3) lattice of diamond, giving rise to novel C(sp3)C(sp2) hybrid allotropes 
that retain the original physical properties, including electronic ones, which can lead to induced 
metallicity 2.

Description:
A fundamental element known for forming a wide variety of compounds.

Text:
In the case of the nearest neighbors of carbon, boron and nitrogen, equiatomic 
cubic boron nitride (cBN) has been synthesized, which is half as hard as diamond but exhibits 
much higher thermal and chemical stability 3. Research efforts to identify new superhard phases of compounds of light elements require the 
use of structure prediction programs such as USPEX 4 and CALYPSO 5. However, novel 
structures can also be identified through the application of crystal engineering rationale as 
presented here. In all cases, such predictions must be validated by the quantitative study of 
energies and the derived physical properties using firstprinciples calculations. Over the years, 
the wellestablished quantum mechanics framework of the density functional theory (DFT) 6,7 
has proven to be the most efficient.
