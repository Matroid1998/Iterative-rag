Description:
Elements that can form multiple bonds with bond orders ranging from single to sextuple.

Text:
The concept of multiple bonding between metals dates back to the late 1920s with the rst struc
tural conrmation in 1964.1 Over the last 60 years, multiple bonds between a wide variety of
transition metals have been assigned bond orders ranging from single to sextuple.24 Nowadays,
synthetic chemists seek out new metalmetal bonds for as catalysts, building blocks in metal
organic frameworks, photosensitizers, and molecular conductors.3,58 Group 6 metalmetal bonds
have been broadly studied for their interesting bonding and unique photophysical properties.9,10
Of these, CrCr multiple bonds are notable because of their rich electronic structure and unique
spectroscopic properties.
