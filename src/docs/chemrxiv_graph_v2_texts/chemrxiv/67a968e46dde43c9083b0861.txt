Bismuth 
nanoparticles 
(Bi 
NPs) 
and 
nanostructures are being investigated for 
their potential technological applications, 
resulting in an everincreasing number of 
publications on their fabrication and optical 
properties6,7,8,9. Pharmaceutical 
and 
metallurgical applications of bismuth have 
gained 
significant 
attention 
in 
recent 
years10,11,12. Apart from its thin conduction
