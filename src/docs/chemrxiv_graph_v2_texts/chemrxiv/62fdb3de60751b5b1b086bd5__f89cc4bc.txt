Description:
Identified as a major decomposition product.

Text:
N2O, NO2, CH2O, NO, HCN, CO2,
CO, and H2O were identified as the major decomposition products. The combustion characteristics of RDX crystal
were studied by Yan et al. 7 with optical diagnosis methods. The reactions of NO and HCN (the products from
RDX decomposition) dominate the heat release in the flame, which are further converted to N2, H2O, and CO in
the downstream flame. Although many efforts are made to understand the thermal decomposition of RDX, the
overall chemical mechanism during thermolysis remains obscure due to the ultrafast and complex reactions
involved, which can hardly be captured in experiments. The quantum mechanics (QM) approach is employed in the investigations of the thermal decomposition of
RDX molecules, especially for the initial decomposition reaction of single RDX molecule.

Description:
A gas produced during the decomposition of RDX.

Text:
In this mechanism, RDX gradually decomposes into N2O, NO2, NO, HCN, CH2O, CO, CO2, H2O, and other
small gasphase products. Recently, Zhang et al.11 proposed a kinetic model for RDX decomposition. They
claimed that the NNO2 homolysis to form RDR radical is the dominant decomposition pathway of RDX, which
subsequently undergoes CH scission and ringopening reaction. Although the accurate DFT calculations reveal
