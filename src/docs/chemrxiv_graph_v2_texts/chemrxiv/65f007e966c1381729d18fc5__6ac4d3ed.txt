Description:
A surface contaminant formed from LiH exchange in the presence of protic solvents.

Text:
It is well known
that LLZO undergoes LiH exchange in the presence of protic solvents, such as water vapour
in air1123. Neutron diffraction19 and transmission electron microscopy15 studies have shown that
protons insert into the Li sites of LLZO without modifying the cubic crystal structure. In air,
LiH exchange results in the formation of surface contaminants, such as LiOH and Li2CO3, as
