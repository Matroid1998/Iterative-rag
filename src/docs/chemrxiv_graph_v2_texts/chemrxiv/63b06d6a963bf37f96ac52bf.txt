Description:
A compound that causes a strong fluorescence increase in sensors.

Text:
All sensors showed a strong 

7
fluorescence increase upon dopamine addition. Fluorescence of pristine SWCNTs increased by 
113  whereas fluorescence of GdSWCNTs with a high defect density (GdhighSWCNTs) 
increased by 72  (Figure 1 d).
