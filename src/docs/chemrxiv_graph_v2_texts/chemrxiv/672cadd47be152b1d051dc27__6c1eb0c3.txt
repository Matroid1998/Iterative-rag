Description:
A ligand whose properties can be analyzed using 1JCSe coupling constants.

Text:
It is particularly 
attractive for estimating the donation of divalent carbon ligand, as it only requires 
the 13C or 1H NMR spectrum of the readily available NHC precursor azolium salt.23 On 
the other hand, the 1JCSe coupling constant has been shown to provide valuable 
information on NHC ligands; however, its measurement is hindered by the low natural
