Description:
In some cases, the rate of the coupled reaction is higher outside of the reaction network.

hough it is true that these species mediate the coupled reaction 
without being consumed, this does not necessarily mean that 
they correspond to what most chemists would consider a cata
lyst.41 Chemists usually understand catalysis to mean that the 
overall energy barrier of a transformation has been lowered rel
ative to the uncatalyzed pathway. In some cases (e.g., catenane 
6), the rate of the coupled reaction is higher outside of the reac
tion network. Thus, we prefer mediates to catalyzes as it 
covers all eventualities. That said, catalyze is obviously correct 
in analogous biological systems, which are highly optimized.28 
But my reaction is irreversible Throughout we have 
treated all reactions as fully reversible.
