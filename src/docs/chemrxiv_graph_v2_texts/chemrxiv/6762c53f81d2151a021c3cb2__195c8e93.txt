propenylidenemalononitrile (DCTB)  98  and sodium 
trifluoroacetic acid (NaTFA) 98  were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich. THF 99.6  stabilized with BHT was 
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Methanol LCMS 
grade  99.9  was purchased from Honeywell. All the 
chemicals were used as recieved without any further 
purification. PBPAC methanolysis 
The protocol used in the study is similar to the one proposed 
by Bhogle et al.5 For complete depolymerization, in 8 mL 
glass vials, 30 mg of PBPAC is added (for a final
