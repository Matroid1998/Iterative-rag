Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and is targeted for capture and removal from the atmosphere.

Text:
Carbondioxide (CO2) emissions account for 76 of total greenhousegas emissions and are 
currently 50 higher than preindustrial levels. As a result, temperatures are expected to rise at 
least 2C unless CO2 is captured and removed from the atmosphere.13 Traditional directair
capture technologies (DAC),4 use alkaline aqueous sorbents (e.g., KOH(aq)) to capture ambient CO2 
as mixtures of (bi)carbonates, which are thermallydecomposed into a pure CO2 gas stream for 
permanent removal (Figure 1a).

Description:
A gas that is captured and requires significant thermal energy for sorbent regeneration.

Text:
Unfortunately, this technology is energy intensive and 
expensive, largely because of the significant thermal energy penalty (150 kJ mol1) required to 
regenerate the sorbent after it has captured CO2 (Figure 1a, Step 4).5 This thermal energy is often 
provided by burning natural gas, which results in CO2 emissions that reduce the net amount of 
CO2 removed from the atmosphere by DAC. chemrxiv
