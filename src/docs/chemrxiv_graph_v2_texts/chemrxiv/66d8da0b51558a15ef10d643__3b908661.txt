Description:
Produced with high selectivity from syngas fermentation using C. autoethanogenum and C. kluyveri.

Text:
For instance, a carbonnegative fer
mentation process using engineered and closely related Clostridium autoethanogenum to convert waste gas feed
stocks into acetone and isopropanol with high efficiency.10 A Agcatalyst based gas diffusion electrolyzer for CO
tosyngas conversion was coupled with syngasfermenting C. autoethanogenum and C. kluyveri, producing butanol 
and hexanol with high selectivity and therefore offers a sustainable pathway for industrial chemical production from 
CO and water using renewable energy.11
To further harness and optimize the metabolic capabilities of these microorganisms, adaptive laboratory evolution 
(ALE) emerges as a powerful tool to select and enhance beneficial traits without the need for genetic engineering.
