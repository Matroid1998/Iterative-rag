Description:
Produced as a result of fatty acid oxidation and involved in various physiological pathways.

Text:
Fatty acid oxidation 
43 
disorders (FAOD) occur due to the deficient activity of the enzymes or transporter proteins 
44 
involved in the pathway, which results in the accumulation of acylCoA esters3. The acyl
45 
CoA accumulation profile provides information on the type of fatty acid oxidation disorder 
46 
(FAOD). Intracellular acylCoA levels are important reporters of metabolic health and their 
47 
accumulation in case of FAOD makes them interesting biomarkers7. Apart from FAOD, 
48 
these compounds are also involved in progression of cancer810, diabetes1114, precursors 
49 
for lipid synthesis and ketone bodies. Since acylCoA are involved in numerous physiological 
50 
and pathophysiological pathways, it is important to develop analytical methods for their 
51 
identification and quantification.
