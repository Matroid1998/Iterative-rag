Compounds with extremely high halide over oxyanion transport selectivity, enabling pH-switchable chloride-nitrate exchange.

1a). For a better understanding of anion transport and pH 
switching mechanism of this class of transporters, we decided to study an expanded library of PTSCs 
and here report our serendipitous discovery of their extremely high halide over oxyanion transport 
selectivity leading to the pHswitchable chloridenitrate exchange being regulated by the ratelimiting 
nitrate transport process. Fig. 1. (a) Mechanism for pHswitchable anion binding by phenylthiosemicarbazones (PTSCs). (b)
