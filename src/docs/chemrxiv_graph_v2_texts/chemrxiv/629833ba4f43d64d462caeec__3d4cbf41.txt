Description:
Used as C(sp3) coupling partners in C(sp3)C(sp3) bond formation.

Alternatively, redoxneutral metallaphotoredox catalysis9 can 
provide a platform for the development of chemoselective 
C(sp3)C(sp3) cross coupling in part by relying on orthogonal 
redoxdependent activation mechanisms of the two alkyl cou
pling partners. This approach offers the opportunity to use non
traditional reaction partners beyond alkyl (pseudo)halides while 
retaining many of the positive attributes of crosselectrophile 
coupling. For example, researchers have recently found success 
coupling two C(sp3) fragments arising from carboxylic acids, 
activated alcohols, alkyl halides, and CH bonds.10 These ex
amples highlight how the identification of strategies that engage 
distinct classes of C(sp3) coupling partners in C(sp3)C(sp3) 
bond formation can be of broad value from a synthetic and 
mechanistic perspective.
