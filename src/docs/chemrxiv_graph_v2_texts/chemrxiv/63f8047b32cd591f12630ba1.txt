Ions that benefit from enhanced interchain hopping in graft polymers with PEO sidechains, improving transportation.

Owing to their high intrinsic ion conductivity, PEObased electrolytes has 
been studied extensively in the past decades.7 
Nevertheless, PEObased SPEs suffer from poor ionic conductivity below 60 C, 
due to the low chain mobility induced by crystallization, rendering them inadequate for 
practical applications.8 In order to improve the performance of PEObased electrolytes 
in terms of ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, various approaches have been 
developed, such as blending or copolymerization with other polymers,916 adding 
plasticizers or inorganic particles,1725 and crosslinking polymer matrix.26 Among these 
strategies, graft copolymers (or brush polymers) containing PEO sidechains used for 
electrolytes have been studied widely.2729 Compared with linear PEO chains, the 
densely grafted PEO chains in graft polymers can enhance the interchain hopping of 
Li ions, and also avoid crystallization and chain entanglement of PEO.3032 Therefore, 
copolymers with grafted PEO sidechains are expected to be an effective approach to 
improve the transportation of Li ions.
