Description:
Undergoes oxidative addition to an organic halide as the first elementary step in coupling reactions.

Text:
The SuzukiMiyaura coupling reaction, the BuchwaldHartwig coupling reaction, and the 
Sonogoshira coupling reaction are among the most frequently used synthetic reactions in 
drug discovery according to recent statistical analysis13, arguably because of 
retrosynthetic simplicity4. Pd catalysis is currently dominant for coupling reactions in 
both academia and industry, but with increasing interest in sustainable reactions at very 
low catalytic loading under aqueous solution along with an organic cosolvent or even in 
the absence of any organic solvent.57 In most of the coupling reactions, Pd(0) oxidative 
addition (OA) to an organic halide is the first elementary step (Scheme 1)8,9 and often is 
also the ratedetermining step1015 orand the stereodetermining step1416 in the overall 
Pd catalysis of coupling reactions involved with organic halides.

Description:
Involved in oxidative addition to organic halides, determining chemoselectivity in catalysis.

Text:
In addition, selective Pd(0) 
OA in the presence of two or more organic halides will usually determine the chemo
selectivity in many Pd catalyzed dominoonepot reactions1724 resulting into complex 
functional molecules in an efficient manner. Scheme 1. Pd(0) Oxidative addition to organic halides. Pd(0)
