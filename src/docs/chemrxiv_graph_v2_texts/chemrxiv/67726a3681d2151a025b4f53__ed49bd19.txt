Description:
Selectively produced by Cu NCs at lower overpotentials.

Text:
The pioneering work in this 
field, initiated by Tang et al., demonstrated that Cu NCs exhibit formic acid (HCOOH) selectively at 
lower overpotentials.10 However, as the applied potential increases, the selectivity shifts towards 
the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). They further identified that the presence of lattice hydrides 
in Cu NCs plays a crucial role in promoting product selectivity. However, Li et al. identified another 
Cu NC containing the highest metaltohydride ratio that predominately produces HCOOH.11 On the 
other side, Liu et al. synthesized three distinct hydrides free Cu8 NCs by systematically varying the 
surfaceprotecting ligands.12 These variations in ligands altered the arrangement of the metal ions, 
resulting in two distinct geometric structures. They discovered that twistedcubic Cu8 NCs favored 
the HER, whereas ditetrahedronshaped Cu8 NCs predominantly produced HCOOH.
