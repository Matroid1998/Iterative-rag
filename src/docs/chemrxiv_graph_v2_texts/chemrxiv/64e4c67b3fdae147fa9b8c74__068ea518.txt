Description:
A compound used as a dopant in DNP juice to enhance polarization transfers.

Text:
We present a comprehensive theory of polarization transfers by FIRE. We then 
demonstrate polarizations up to 17 in the liquid state after only 10 min of DNP for 13Cformate and 313C
pyruvate in DNP juice doped with 50 mM TEMPOL. Finally, we propose routes to extend the applicability of 
the method to molecules with weak J couplings such as 113Cpyruvate, which is highly relevant to in vivo 
imaging. Theory 
FIRE makes use of an adiabatic magnetic field inversion to transfer Zeeman order between heteronuclear spins 
via their J coupling. A quantum adiabatic process is a transformation that is slow enough to allow the system to 
remain in its eigenstates.
