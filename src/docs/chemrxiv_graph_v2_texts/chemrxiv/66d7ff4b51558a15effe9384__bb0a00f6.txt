pinging photons is captured and stored as chemical energy in or
ganic substances, thereby CO2 is used as a carbon source. As a
side product, O2 is generated.1
Cyanobacteria are subject to many fundamental research stud
ies and are of biotechnological relevance. They were identified
as potential producers of biofuels1, high value chemicals like pig
ments, proteins, and vitamins. Furthermore, they can be used for
waste water treatment and the degradation of oil components. Cyanobacterial biomass can also be used as food supplement for
humans or as a feed additive in aqua culture2,3. Labscale cultivation devices for cyanobacteria commonly in
clude microtiterplates, shake flasks, bubble columns, flatpanel
reactors, stirred tank reactors and tubular reactors. Of these, only
microtiterplates are applicable for automated highthroughput
screening4.
