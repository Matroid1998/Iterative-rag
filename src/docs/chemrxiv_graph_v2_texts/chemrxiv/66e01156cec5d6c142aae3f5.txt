Description:
The largest terrestrial repository of organic carbon, storing more than three times the amount found in vegetation and approximately twice as much as the atmosphere.

Soil plays a key role in sustaining both human societies and terrestrial ecosystems. As a 
biogeochemical engine of the Earths life support system, soil fulfils many crucial functions.1, 
2. Soil anchors plant roots and serves as a reservoir of essential nutrients. Furthermore, it 
acts as a natural filtration system for rainwater, safeguarding underground water sources by 
buffering against waste and pollutants.2, 3 Besides these practical functions, soil is the 
largest terrestrial repository of organic carbon4, storing more than three times the amount of 
organic carbon found in vegetation and approximately twice as much as the atmosphere.5 
This has contributed to a recent upsurge in interest in agricultural management strategies 
that aim to improve carbon storage as well as preserving or improving soil resources for 
future generations.
