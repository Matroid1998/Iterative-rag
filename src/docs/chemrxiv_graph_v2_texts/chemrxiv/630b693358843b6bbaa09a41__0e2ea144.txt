Description:
A typical oxo cluster used in material science.

Text:
Atomically precise clusters are valuable building blocks for material science.1,2 They span
a broad range; from oxo clusters, over metal clusters to semiconducting clusters, e.g.,
Zr6O4(OH)4(OOCMe)12 (Zr6), Hf6O4(OH)4(OOCMe)12 (Hf6), Ti8O8(OOCPh)12 (Ti8), Au55
(PPh3)12Cl6, Cd84Se56(O2CPh)56(RNH2)56, or In37P20(O2CCH2Ph)51.37 Clusters are used to
build stimuliresponsive materials,8 or hierarchical (porous) structures.9,10 Clusters can be
precursors or intermediates in nanocrystal synthesis.11,12 Composites with improved strength
are produced by incorporating zirconium oxo clusters in polymers.13 Zirconium and hafnium
oxo clusters are used as catalysts to make or break amide bonds,14,15 and they are are suitable
as inorganic extremeultraviolet photoresists.16,17 Subtle differences in cluster chemistry be
tween Zr and Hf are exploited in the industrial separation of Zr from Hf.18 The whole field of
group 4 MOFs is based on group 4 metal oxo clusters that act as secondary building units (or
nodes) in the MOF framework.7,1921 Apart from the typical Ti8, Zr6, and Hf6 oxo clusters
