Description:
Formed from the conversion of CO2 using bifunctional organoboron catalysts.

Text:
In a seminal study by Wu and colleagues, they 
introduced a bifunctional organoboron catalyst that combines a boron center with a quaternary 
ammonium salt, showcasing remarkable reactivity in ROP.28 These catalysts have proven to be easily 
accessible and highly versatile, useful for a variety of chemical transformations, including the 
copolymerization of epoxides with anhydrides and the conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates.2931 The 
approach of covalently linking Lewis acids and Lewis bases not only preserves their individual chemical 
properties but also allows tuning the linker to enhance the synergistic catalytic activity of both 
components. This design strategy has been extended to various molecular structures incorporating other 
onium salts and boranes.
