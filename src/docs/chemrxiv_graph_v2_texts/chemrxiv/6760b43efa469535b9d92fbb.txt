Description:
Studied at water-conductor and water-insulator interfaces to understand interfacial changes in ion pairing thermodynamics.

Text:
The structure and composition of electrolytes at aqueous interfaces plays a crucial role in
electrochemistry,17 and atmospheric chemistry.8,9 At these interfaces, the electrolyte ions
encounter a sharp dielectric discontinuity, rapid fluctuations in water density,1013 and a
molecularly heterogeneous environment where ionwater interactions give way to interactions
with atoms in the interface.14,15 The interplay of these effects creates a complex interfacial
environment that controls the approach of individual ions to the interface, and modifies their
interactions and correlations relative to the bulk. In this study, we apply insights gained
from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of NaCl at waterconductor and waterinsulator
interfaces to construct a simple dielectric continuum theory for predicting the interfacial
changes in ion pairing thermodynamics using readily available properties of the electrolyte
and interface.
