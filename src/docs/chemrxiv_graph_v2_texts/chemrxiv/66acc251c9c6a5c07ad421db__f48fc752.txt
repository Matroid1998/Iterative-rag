Description:
A metal whose nanoparticles' morphology and catalytic activity can be altered by thermal treatments.

Text:
At such 
elevated temperatures, enhanced particle mobility may result in sintering, which has been observed 
for thermal treatments under both oxidative1518 and H2containing1920 environment. These 
effects may alter the morphology of the Pt nanoparticles and hence the specific catalytic activity in 
structure sensitive dehydrogenation reactions. Contrary, direct chemical reduction to metallic Pt 
can circumvent thermal treatment prior to catalytic application.
