Description:
A component of a dodecanuclear cluster with an S 10 ground state, exhibiting sizable zero-field splitting and slow relaxation at low temperatures.

Several decades ago, the idea arose that paramagnetic molecules could replace the magnetic parti
cles used in hard disk storage devices, which could allow data densities that were orders of magni
tude higher than the state of the art at the time. These investigations started with a dodecanuclear
manganese cluster with an S  10 ground state.1 This ground state possesses a sizable zerofield
splitting (ZFS), resulting in an energy barrier towards inversion of the magnetic moment, and
concurrent slow relaxation at low temperatures.1 Molecules that possess this property have been
named singlemolecule magnets (SMMs).
