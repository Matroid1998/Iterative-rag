Description:
Binds to the nucleotide binding domain (nbd) and participates in phosphate hydrolysis.

Text:
According to crystallographic, mutational and other studies 
2, 3 , FtsZ 
contains two main bindingcavities for known ligands, the interdomain cleft (idc) 
and the nucleotide binding domain (nbd). The nbd binds GTPGDP, and 
participates in FtsZ folding and GTP phosphate hydrolysis
4 . FtsZ switches from 
a closedrelaxed conformation in monomers to an opentense conformation in 
filaments 
5 . Suggested by crystallographic observations
6 ,7 , the FtsZ transitions 
were confirmed by several studies
3, 79 . At each dimerization step, a new interface 
is generated including the cocatalytic loop from one of the monomers and the 
complementary GTPcontaining nbd from other monomer.
