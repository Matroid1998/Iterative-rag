Description:
Coordination with a chiral Lewis acid complex significantly lowers their triplet energy, allowing for selective excitation and enantioselective control.

Text:
While this strategy 
relies on direct excitation of the substrate, the work of Yoon introduced the use of a chiral Lewis 
acid for enantioselective triplet energytransfer catalysis that proceeds with a discrete photocatalyst 
separate from the Lewis acid (Scheme 1B).5c In this case, the coordination of the chiral Lewis acid 
complex to 2hydroxychalcones causes a significant lowering of the triplet energy of the substrate, 
allowing for selective excitation and subsequent enantioselective control.
