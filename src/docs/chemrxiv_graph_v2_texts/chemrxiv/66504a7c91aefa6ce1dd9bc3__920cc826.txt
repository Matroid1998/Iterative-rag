Description:
A compound that suffers from oxidation on the carbon in position 9, degrading to fluorenone.

As acceptor 
groups, choices are more divers ranging from cyanobased groups to hetero atom containing or 
linked aromatic systems.1,3,18 Though popular, this molecular design often results in reduced 
quantum yields in solid state caused by  assembly inducing aggregation caused quenching 
phenomenon.19,20 A strategy to counteract this issue is to insert bulky spiro9,9bifluorene 
(SBF) either as system or as sidegroup.18,2125 The perpendicular arrangement of the aro
matic core results in a high steric demand with a rigid structure that limits  assembly, char
acteristics allowing the use of SBF in different applications.2631 The crossshape configuration 
also leads to better thermal stability and higher glass transition temperatures compared to anal
ogous fluorene derivatives,32,33 which are suffering from oxidation on the carbon in position 9 
degrading to fluorenone.

Description:
Often used in TADF emitters designed to display through space ICT.

Text:
For this reason, most TADF emitters based on fluorene are designed 
to display through space ICT,34,35 whereas DA 2,7substituted fluorene derivatives rarely dis
play TADF behavior. Noteworthy, examples employing nitrile as acceptor in position 7 and 
phenoxazine36 or triphenylamine37 in position 2 as donor are not showing TADF emission, 
but emission from hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) states.38
