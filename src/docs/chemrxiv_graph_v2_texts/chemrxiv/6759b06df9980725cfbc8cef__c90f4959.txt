Description:
A gas molecule that interacts with MOF frameworks.

Text:
screened the CoRE MOF database to evaluate 
whether MOFs are suitable for DAC application.16 While these methods are timeefficient, they struggle 
to accurately describe the interaction between the MOF frameworks and the gas molecules such as CO2 
and H2O, due to the diversity of chemical environments and the complexity of the shortrange potential
