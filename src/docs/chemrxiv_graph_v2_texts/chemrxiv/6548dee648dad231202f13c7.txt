Description:
Used in polymerization catalyzed by rare-earth anthracenide complexes.

Text:
Additionally, these compounds are expected to display 
distinct reactivity that is comparable to that of frustrated 
Lewis pairs, such as the activation of CH, HH, and multiple 
CC bonds. Moreover, the mentioned FLPlike rareearth 
naphtalenide15, 3134 and anthracenide3436 compounds have 
been found to perform twoelectron reduction of organic 
and inorganic substrates. There is only one known case of 
using rareearth anthracenide complexes of a conjectural 
formula Ln(C14H10)(DME)n (Ln  Sm, Yb) to catalyze the 
ethylene polymerization,37 but the used complexes have not 
been isolated as individual compounds; their structures and 
properties remain unidentified. Although the anthracene dianion was introduced to 
organolanthanide chemistry three decades ago,3, 9, 25, 38 its 
rareearth complexes are still poorly studied.
