Description:
An interlocked molecular structure formed using a metal ion template.

Text:
In 1983, Sauvage and coworkers reported the use of a metal ion to template the formation of a catenane 
in high yield1. Their seminal Cuphenanthroline motif inspired the development of a great many other metal 
directed syntheses of catenanes, rotaxanes and knots2 which, alongside passive templates based on other 
noncovalent interactions3, have revolutionized the synthesis of interlocked molecules. A biproduct of this 
progress has been that a great many mechanically chelating ligands  molecules in which two or more of 
the covalent subcomponents provide donor atoms  have been described with denticities varying from 24 
to 95,6. However, the interlocked metal complexes themselves are typically intermediates in the synthesis
