Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and can be captured from air using direct air capture technologies.

Text:
The growing anthropogenic CO2 emission to the atmosphere over the past decades has raised
a series of concerns over its environmental impacts,1 such as global warming2 and food
security.3 Among the existing technologies to attack this problem, direct air capture (DAC)
can effectively reduce the current amount of CO2 already present in air and is specially
suitable to remove distributed emission of CO2 (from transportation vehicles, for example).4
DAC employs highly efficient sorbents to extract CO2 from ultradilute sources (such as
ambient air), and the extracted CO2 can be further coupled with geological sequestration5
or conversion into valueadded products.6
An increasingly popular class of DAC sorbents consists of amines supported into solid
matrices.

Description:
A gas that can be efficiently captured from air by supported amine composites at ambient conditions.

Text:
Supported amines composites can efficiently capture CO2 from air at ambient con
ditions, are not adversely affected by water vapor and can be regenerated by relatively mild
temperature swings.7,8 Since the amine chemical structure is known to influence both the
CO2 absorption capacity and the degradation of the supported amines,912 the development
of new methods to understand CO2 adsorption under experimentallyrelevant condition is
desirable. However, uptodate, the mechanism of CO2 binding in condensed phase amines
at ambient conditions is still lacking. The main contribution to the mechanistic studies of CO2 binding in amines comes from
electronic structure calculations of isolated clusters.
