Description:
A material with unique optical and photoredox properties, including bandgap and intragap states, and quasi-Fermi levels of electrons and holes.

Heptazinebased polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials1 stand out from a range of 
other typical, mostly metal oxidebased photocatalysts mainly by their unique optical (i.e., 
bandgap and intragap states)2 and photoredox (i.e., quasiFermi levels of electrons and 
holes) properties.3 Nevertheless, the typical absorption onset of PCN is around 430450 
nm, which is far from making it an ideal absorber of solar radiation. This motivated 
significant research efforts directed towards shifting the optical absorption and the 
corresponding photocatalytic activity to the red. In general, one can distinguish two basic 
strategies for achieving this goal.
