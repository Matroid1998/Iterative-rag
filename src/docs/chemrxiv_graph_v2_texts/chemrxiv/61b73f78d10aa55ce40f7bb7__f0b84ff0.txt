Description:
Substituted compounds used in pentacyano (L) ferrates (II) complexes.

Text:
It was found that there was a linear correlation between the halfwave oxidation potentials E12 
of the pentacyano (L) ferrates (II) complexes, where L refers to various substituted pyrazoles 
and indazoles, and pKaH of pyrazolium and indazolium cations respectively 1. In the present 
article the pKaH data of pyrazolium and indazolium cations is used to make Taft and Hammett 
plots and using the Taft  and Hammett  values the ReactivitySelectivity Principle is 
explained in a simple and lucid way. Methods 
All correlations were done using KaleidaGraph software, Reading, PA, USA. All the chemical 
structures were drawn using chemdraw. The pKaH data is from reference 1. Reaction constants 
(Hammett  and Taft ) are to be understood as positive values.
