Description:
A subfamily of sesquiterpene lactones identified in chicory.

sativum) typically contain around 3  of secondary 
metabolites by weight.11 Such compounds are mainly phenolic and 
polyphenolic compounds, sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) and 
flavonoids (to a lesser extent).11 
For the purposes of this work, we focused on the sesquiterpene 
lactones found in the root of industrial chicory. Around fifteen STLs 
belonging to the guaianolide subfamily have been identified, with 
lactucin (Lc) and its ester analog lactucopicrin (Lp) being the most 
wellknown, as they were previously identified in wild lettuce 
(Lactuca virosa).12,13 Within the root of industrial chicory, these STLs 
predominantly exist as conjugated oxalate and glucoside derivatives. 14 The previous STLs, along with their respective saturated analogs, 
11,13dihydrolactucin and 11,13dihydrolactucopicrin, can also be 
found in the root.
