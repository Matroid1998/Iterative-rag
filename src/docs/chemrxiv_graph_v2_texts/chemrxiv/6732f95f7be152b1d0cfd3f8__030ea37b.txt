Description:
Produced as a solar fuel through artificial photosynthesis.

Text:
Artificial photosynthesis has emerged as an 
important strategy to utilize sustainable energy in 
the form of solar energy as a clean energy source. 1
7 The end products of artificial photosynthesis6 are 
known as solar fuels8 (hydrogen,911 hydrogen 
peroxide,11, 12 methanol,2 HCOOH,13 methane,14 
ammonia15 etc.) which can be produced in a 
cleaner way through water splitting,16, 17 CO2 
reduction18, 
19 and N2 reduction.20 Although 
hydrogen is considered as possible alternative to 
carbonbased fuels,6 recently H2O2 has emerged as 
suitable alternative to both carbon fuel and 
hydrogen.7, 21 H2O2 is a liquid chemical and thus 
easy to transport and utilize compared to hydrogen 
which requires energyintensive process for its 
transport and storage.
