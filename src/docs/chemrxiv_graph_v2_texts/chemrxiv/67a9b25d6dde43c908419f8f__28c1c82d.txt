Description:
A biosourced and biodegradable material used in FDM 3D printing filaments.

Text:
The most common types of 3D printers are FDM (Fusion Deposition Modelling) and SLA (Stereolithography) or (m)SLA (masked 
Stereolithography). FDM printers melt a plastic filament and deposit it layer by layer, forming the final 3D structure. Stereolithography printers, instead, use a laser (SLA) or UVLED ((m)SLA) to photo crosslink a liquid resin to solid objects layer 
by layer (1). Arguably, in a time when the world is trying to reduce the use of plastic materials, 3D printing seems counterintuitive 
in terms of green materials. More sustainable and biodegradable materials are available nowadays (4), but mostly regarding 
FDM and filaments consisting of recycled PETG and biosourced PLA (5).
