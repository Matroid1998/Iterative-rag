Description:
Exhibit higher basicity compared to sultams.

Text:
Unlike 
azetidines, 
pyrrolidines, 
piperidines, 
etc., 
sultams 
demonstrate lower basicity, increased aqueous solubility, 
easy modification via Nalkylation, nonplanar three
dimensional structure, as well as resistance to protease
catalyzed cleavage. Notably, sultams closely resemble 
pyrrolidines in conformation, rather than their direct 
isosteric analogs  lactams (pyrrolidones) with a flat amide 
moiety, therefore providing higher threedimensionality. Theoretical studies4750 and experimental data5155 have 
demonstrated distinct conformational properties between 
amide and sulfonamide groups. Amide fragments typically 
adopt a planar configuration (torsion angle of the amide 
bond at 0 or 180), while sulfonamides mainly exist in 
synclinal or anticlinal conformations (with corresponding 
torsion angles of 60 and 100). Furthermore, the 
sulfonamide 
nitrogen 
atom 
exhibits 
nonplanarity, 
characterized by significant pyramidization.
