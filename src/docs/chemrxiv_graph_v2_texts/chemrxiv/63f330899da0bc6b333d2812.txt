Description:
A molecule that can be part of a noninteracting supersystem with water, affecting ionization energy predictions.

Text:
An average pooling model
will correctly predict that the IE remains constant for a
noninteracting supersystem consisting of two separated
water molecules. However, for a noninteracting super
system consisting of one water and one CO2 molecule,
this model would predict that the IE is the average of the
corresponding water and CO2 values, which is clearly in
correct. The problem here is that the model fails to take
into account that an ionization of this supersystem is lo
calized on the water molecule, since it has the lower IE. While this is a somewhat artificial example, many real
chemical systems also display ionizations, excitations or
orbitals that are spatially localized.
