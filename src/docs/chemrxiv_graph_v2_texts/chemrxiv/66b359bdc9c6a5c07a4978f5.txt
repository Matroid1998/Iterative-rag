Abstract
Accurate prediction of toluenewater partition coefficients of neutral species is crucial in drug discovery
and separation processes; however, datadriven modeling of these coefficients remains challenging due to
limited available experimental data.

Description:
Used in partition coefficient models for predicting solubility of neutral species in water.

Toluenewater partition coefficients offer better physiological relevance com
pared to wateroctanol (Caron and Ermondi, 2005; David et al., 2021). Consequently, models that predict
toluenewater partition coefficients for a wide spectrum of neutral species are highly desired. Existing computational methods, such as the COnductor like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents
(COSMORS) (Klamt, 1995; Klamt et al., 1998), Group Contribution (GC), and Molecular Dynamics
(MD) have been employed to predict toluenewater log P of neutral species (Platts et al., 1999; Lin
and Sandler, 2000; Buggert et al., 2009; Loschen and Klamt, 2014; Ince et al., 2015; Bannan et al.,
2016; Mller et al., 2024).
