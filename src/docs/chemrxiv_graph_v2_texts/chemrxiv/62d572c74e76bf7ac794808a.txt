The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) leads to difficultto
treat nosocomial infections and is thus a threat for health care 
systems globally.1,2 Particularly some multidrugresistant (MDR) 
Gramnegative pathogens belonging to the bacterial order of 
Enterobacterales, such as E. coli, have been ranked as critical 
priority by the World Health Organization (WHO).1 In some cases, 
those strains develop resistance towards almost all antibiotics 
currently used in the clinic, leaving no remaining treatment 
options.3 Most of the antibacterial drugs recently approved by the 
FDA derive from known antibiotic classes such as the 
aminoglycoside 
Plazomicin,4 
the 
tetracycline 
derivative 
Eravacycline,5 
and 
the 
lactamlactamase 
inhibitor 
combinations 
MeropenemVaborbactam,6 
CeftolozaneTazobactam and CeftazidimeAvibactam.7 However, 
development of resistance to these drugs is highly probable since
