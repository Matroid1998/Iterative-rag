Description:
An emerging photovoltaic material with an antibonding Sb s and Se p lone pair interaction at the valence band maximum.

Text:
tSe has
deeper valence band maximum (VBM) than the emerging PV ma
terial Sb2Se3
73 as expected due to the antibonding Sb s  Se p
lonepair interaction at the VBM in Sb2Se3, contrasted with the
nonbonding  weak interchain bonding Se p interactions at the
tSe upper valence band. The combination of low carrier effective masses along the Se
chain direction (k)18 and high band degeneracies at both band
edges for tSe results in highfrequency dielectric constants of
e,? 6.71,e,k  10.28, which are large for a semiconductor
with a band gap just under 2 eV, given the typical e

constant are extremely small due to the covalent bonding, giving
an overall dielectric constant of e?

Description:
Used in solar cells with benign grain boundaries that enhance photovoltaic efficiencies.

Text:
In combination with the fact that tSe lms oriented along the c
axis (chain direction) are expected to favour benign grain bound
aries103105  similar to the case of Sb2Se3 solar cells,73,106, this
indicates that tSe lms primarily oriented along the c axis should
exhibit greater photovoltaic efciencies due to increases in both
Jsc and Voc.107
For the optical band gap, values in the range of 1.8  2 eV
 Here ? refers to the direction perpendicular to the helical Se chains in tSe, equiv
alent to the a,b lattice directions, while k is parallel to the Se chains, equivalent to
the c direction. 4
