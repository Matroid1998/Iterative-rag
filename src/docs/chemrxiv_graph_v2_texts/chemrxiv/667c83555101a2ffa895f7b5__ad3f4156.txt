Description:
Electron-deficient aromatics used in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules.

Text:
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots have 
long been considered challenging synthetic targets.1 Most synthetic routes towards MIMs rely on non
covalent interactions to preorganize the individual components before establishing the mechanical 
bond. However, this introduces extraneous functional groups such as ligands for metals 
(phenanthrolines, bipyridines), or electrondeficient aromatics (naphthalene diimides, viologens) which 
 depending on the aim for which they are synthesized  add potentially undesired functionality to the 
final MIMs.1a As an alternative, covalent templates have also been used for constructing MIMs and 
typically display higher robustness and directionality than noncovalent interactions.2 This means 
mechanical bonds can be formed under more challenging conditions, and broader scope and synthetic 
versatility is often observed with covalent templates as compared to noncovalent.
