There are only four major classes of antifungal drugs available on the market for treating 
56 
systemic fungal infections, namely azoles (e.g., fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and 
57 
posaconazole), polyenes (typically amphotericin B), echinocandins (e.g. micafungin and 
58 
caspofungin), and pyrimidine analogues (mainly flucytosine or its salt form).25, 26 Azoles 
59 
(imidazoles and triazoles, containing two and three nitrogens on the azole ring, respectively) 
60 
are a class of antifungal drugs widely used to treat fungal infections in humans.27 They work 
61 
by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes.
