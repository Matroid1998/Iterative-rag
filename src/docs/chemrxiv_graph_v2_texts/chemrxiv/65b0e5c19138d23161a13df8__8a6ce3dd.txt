Description:
Investigated in Li-based cells.

Pillar5quinone 
(P5Q), for instance, features a cavity radius of 4.128  and therefore has low steric hindrance 
as well as high molecular symmetry.14 Both P5Q and calixquinones (calixnquinone, n  4, 6, 
and 8) have been investigated in Libased cells,1520 and recently, P5Q and C4Q were also 
investigated as positive electrodes in SIBs and other battery chemistries.2125 As these 
macrocyclic quinones in their neutral or reduced state are usually soluble in aprotic liquid 
battery electrolytes, which severely reduces their cycling stability, a mitigation strategy has to 
be applied. These strategies generally include carbon encapsulation, salt formation of the active
