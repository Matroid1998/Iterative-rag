Description:
A ubiquitous chemical motif used as a cereblon binding motif (CBM) in targeted protein degradation.

Text:
Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) has emerged as 
a powerful new mechanism to leverage against previously 
undruggable disease targets.1, 2 Key to this approach is the 
recognition of the putative small molecule degrader by Cere
blon. In this space, two such modalities have emerged; Ligand 
Directed Degraders (LDDs)3 wherein a target recognition mol
ecule is linked to a cereblon binding motif (CBM) and molecular 
glues or CELMoDs (Cereblon E3 Ligase Modulatory Drugs)4 
that create a suitable proteinprotein interaction between 
Cereblon and the target protein. In both cases, Cereblon helps 
mediate ubiquitin transfer and subsequent proteasomal degra
dation (Figure 1A). Many chemical motifs have emerged as 
competent CBM, but none is more ubiquitous than glutarimide.

Description:
Revealed after high-pressure hydrogenation of dibenzoyl pyridine.

The exploration of novel glutarimidecontain
ing CBMs can alter the activity, depth of degradation, pharma
cokineticpharmacodynamic properties, and offtarget ne
osubstrate selectivity, which can impact the overall success of 
a potential degrader in the clinic.7 
One emerging class of CBMs is the N(hetero)aryl glu
tarimide, which has begun to find applications in a range of 
disease targets.8, 9 Despite the promise of this CBM in degrader 
drug discovery, efforts to rigorously explore structureactivity 
relationships (SAR) have been limited by the inefficient and be
spoke synthetic strategies currently employed (Figure 1B). Such strategies fall into two categories 1) alkylation of anilines 
with an halo glutarimide and 2) CN crosscoupling of a 
dibenzoyl pyridine which reveals the glutarimide after high
pressure hydrogenation.
