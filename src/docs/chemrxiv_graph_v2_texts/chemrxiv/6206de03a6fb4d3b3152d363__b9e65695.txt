Description:
Analogues designed for anticancer activity.

Text:
Cyanophenylacrylates continue to attract attention as components and products of organic 
synthesis. Thus, methoxy ringsubstituted methyl cyanophenylacrylates, MCPA was used in 
synthesis of pyridotriazines and triazolopyridines 1. There are a number of applications 
of ethyl cyanophenylacrylates (ECPA), which include studies of catalysis 2 and as 
potential antimicrobial and antioxidant agents 3. 2,4Dimethoxyphenyl ECPA was used 
in design, synthesis and study of anticancer activity of novel benzothiazole analogues 4, 
in synthesis of thiazacridine derivatives as anticancer agents against breast and 
hematopoietic neoplastic cells 5 and in DABCOcatalyzed Knoevenagel condensation, 
using hydroxy ionic liquid as a promoter 6.
