Description:
A major component of the atmosphere in an anoxic environment.

8  Assuming an 
atmosphere that mainly consisted of N2 and CO2 with traces of 
CO, H2 and reduced sulfur gases, i.e., an anoxic environment,9 
makes the coexistence of iron(III) minerals and reduced iron 
compounds plausible.8a, 10  A weakly reducing atmosphere 
stabilizes elemental iron derived from meteorite impact or 
serpentinization of mafic rocks and iron(II) minerals stemming 
from weathering of the basalt and komatiiterich earth crust in the 
Hadean eon.8a, 11 Previous studies focused mainly on iron(III)
mediated peptide formation. 12
 With the environmental 
constraints of an anoxic environment in mind we propose that 
reduced iron species might be superior mediators for prebiotic 
peptide syntheses. However, to our knowledge, neither metallic 
iron as starting material nor active iron(II) intermediates have yet 
been considered for prebiotic amino acid coupling.
