Description:
A derivative of fluorescein used as a fluorophore in fluorescence imaging.

Text:
Labelfree detection methods like NIR spectroscopy can identify spectral fingerprints of 
molecules4 and can even penetrate the skull for brainfunctional NIR spectroscopy.5 However, this technique still 
faces challenges in being established in clinical practice.6 Fluorescence imaging and sensing, on the other hand, 
have been used for a long time, employing fluorophores such as fluorescein7 (fluorescein isothiocyanate  FITC) 
and DAPI8 to visualize cells and proteins.
