Description:
An ideal chiral fragment that can be introduced to donor or acceptor systems through a one-step reaction.

Text:
RS1,1bi2naphthol (BINOL), is considered as an ideal 
chiral fragment since it can be introduced to the donor or 
acceptor system through a onestep reaction without further 
chiral resolution 2122. Researchers have utilized binaphthyl
based CPTADF materials as emitter layers of circularly
