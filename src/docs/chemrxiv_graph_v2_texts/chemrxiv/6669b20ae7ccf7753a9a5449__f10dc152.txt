Description:
Oxidized to the 4 species in the presence of molecular oxygen from air.

In 2023, Can Jins research group accomplished the decarboxy
lative halogenation of aliphatic carboxylic acids via cerium 
LMCT in an aqueous medium.17 In the presence of molecular 
oxygen from air, Ce(III) is oxidised to the 4 species, which 
forms complexes with the carboxylic acid starting material, and 
the cleavage of the OCe bond is achieved upon excitation with 
100 W blue LEDs (Scheme 1, a). The resulting electronrich 
radicals are trapped with electrophilic bromine or chlorine 
radicals.17 In a similar project, Li et al.
