reported a pair of Mn(III)Schiff base complexes with the general formula
Mn(R sal2323) (Figure 1).7 The spin crossover property of this class of complexes was
characterized by Morgan et al. in 2006.3 The roles of substituents, counter ion, and solvent
on spin crossover and other physical phenomena were also investigated.813
Figure 1 The molecular structures of Mn(R sal2323). Ligand structure is denoted
R sal2323, where R represents the substituents at the aromatic ring and 323 denotes the
8carbon alkyl connectivity in the ligand. Only amine hydrogen atoms are shown for clarity. Computational methods can predict spin crossover, provided that both the molecular
