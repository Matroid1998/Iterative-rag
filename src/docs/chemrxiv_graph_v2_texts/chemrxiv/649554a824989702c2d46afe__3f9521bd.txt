Description:
A molecule that can be converted to ammonia by transition metal complexes and nitrogenase enzymes.

Nitrogen fixation, a critical process for sustaining life on Earth, plays an essential role in the
global nitrogen cycle, and provides bioavailable nitrogen for the growth and development
of all living organisms. Although the atmosphere is composed of approximately 78
nitrogen, its inert nature renders it inaccessible to most life forms. Nature has evolved an
intricate mechanism to overcome this barrier, primarily through the activity of nitrogen
fixing microorganisms capable of reducing dinitrogen (N2) into bioavailable forms such
as ammonia (NH3). Nitrogen fixation driven by transition metal complexes offers a
less energy intensive alternative to the conventional HaberBosch process 1. These
complexes can effectively catalyze the conversion of N2 to NH3 under similar conditions
as the nitrogenase enzymes in nature.
