Description:
Participate in the oligomerisation reaction catalyzed by HisHis.

However, peptides on the early 
Earth are considered to be plausible prebiotic organocatalysts.14, 
15 Histidylbased peptides have shown promise as prebiotic or
ganocatalysts. HisHis can catalyse the oligomerisation of pep
tides, the dephosphorylation of nucleotides, the hydrolysis of 
oligonucleotides and the oligomerisation reaction with c2,3nu
cleotides.1619 HisHis is proposed to derive its catalytic activity 
from a general acidbase catalysis by proton relay mechanism. SerHis is another prebiotic organocatalyst that catalyses a wide 
range of reactions e.g.

Can form oligonucleotides starting from imidazole-activated nucleotides.

peptide bond formation between an 
amino acid ester and an amino acid.2022 This was exploited to 
drive vesicle growth via SerHis localising inside the membrane 
of vesicles and catalysing the formation of a hydrophobic di
peptide.23 SerHis can catalyse the formation of oligonucleo
tides starting from imidazoleactivated nucleotides.24 Histidyl 
containing cyclic peptides catalyse also the hydrolysis of pyro
phosphate.25 Histidine may also ligate metals e.g. Zn2 to form 
complexes that catalyse depsipeptide oligomerisation.26 In our 
aforementioned physicochemical orthophosphate cycle, we hy
pothesized that a histidyl peptide could serve as a catalyst for
