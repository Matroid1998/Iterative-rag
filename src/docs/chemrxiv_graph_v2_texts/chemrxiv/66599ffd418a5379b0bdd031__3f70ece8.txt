Description:
A candidate for PEC water splitting and solar cells with excellent optoelectronic and electrochemical properties.

Text:
Sb2Se3 has recently gained significant attention as a 
candidate for PEC water splitting and solar cells, benefiting from its excellent optoelectronic 
and electro(chemical) properties, such as high absorption coefficient (  105 cm1 in the near
infrared and visible region),2 suitable band gap (1.11.3 eV),3 good carrier mobility (10 cm2 
V1 s1),4 low cost, and photocorrosion resistance.5 For PEC water splitting, the photocurrent 
density (Jph) of Sb2Se3 photocathodes has been extensively improved from 2 mA cm2 to 35.7 
mA cm2 at 0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE), nearly approaching the 
maximum theoretical value of 40.9 mA cm2.6 However, the photovoltage of Sb2Se3 
photocathodes is still far behind the theoretical maximum value, attributed to a rich defect 
chemistry stemming from the two nonequivalent Sb and three nonequivalent Se atomic sites.

Description:
A compound with a low free carrier density, posing challenges for photovoltage improvement.

Text:
The free carrier density of undoped Sb2Se3 determined from experimental data is only 1013 cm
3, considerably below the optimal doping density (1016 cm3).7,8 These inherent properties pose 
a substantial challenge towards further improvement of the photovoltage.
