Description:
Simple aromatic compounds with absorption overlap at approximately 3 Âµm wavelength.

Optical spectrometers are often more
compact and more readily develop into field
capable instruments and autonomous onsite
detectors for continuous monitoring.9 Some
chemical sensors, such as metal oxide sensors,
photoionization detectors and electrochemi
cal sensors, are starting to reach high sensi
tivities for benzene,10 but spectroscopic de
tectors offer better selectivity and longterm
stability. Various spectroscopic benzene detectors have
achieved detection limits down to ppblevels. However, many use the strong absorption band
at the wavelength of approximately 3 m for
detection,1114 which has significant overlap
with many other organic compounds, most
notably other simple aromatic combounds,
e.g. toluene and xylenes.
