Description:
A layered MOF studied for its electrochemical interface in supercapacitors.

The welldefined structures of MOFs would also help to test 
general design principles for supercapacitors more widely. Design principles for improved supercapacitors should be underpinned by a fundamental 
understanding of charging mechanisms. Such understanding provides deeper insights into why certain 
electrode and electrolyte combinations perform better than others, and could inspire new routes to 
increased performance. To date, only a few computationallyfocussed studies have examined the 
charging mechanisms of MOFbased supercapacitors, with the first such study modelling the double
layer structure and charging process of Nibased layered MOFs with a variety of pore sizes using 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.29 More recently, Walsh et al. expanded on this by studying the 
electrochemical interface of the layered MOF
