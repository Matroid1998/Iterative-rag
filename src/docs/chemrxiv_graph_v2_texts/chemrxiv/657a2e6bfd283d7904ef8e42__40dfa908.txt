Description:
A group that can be hydrogenated following an asymmetric Henry reaction.

Text:
Thus, 
asymmetric epoxidation, asymmetric ketone 
reduction followed by SN2 with a nitrogen
based nucleophile, and asymmetric Henry 
reaction followed by hydrogenation of the nitro 
group are the goto transformations to access 
such 
structures. Although 
Sharpless 
asymmetric 
aminohydroxylation 
enables 
singlestep 
construction 
of 
chiral 
aminoalcohols from a styrene,10,11 it can be 
complicated by regioisomeric impurities12 and 
requires expensive and toxic osmium catalysts. The aforementioned reliance on polar bond 
disconnections (2e logic), necessitate precise 
choreography of protectingfunctional group 
manipulations.
