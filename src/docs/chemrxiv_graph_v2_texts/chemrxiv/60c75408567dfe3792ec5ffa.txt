Description:
Essential for CO2 electrolysis, requiring a plentiful supply and facile diffusion pathway to enhance GDE performance.

Text:
The CO2 electrolysis field has grown 
considerably in the past years, and by using the GDE 
architecture has been able to increase operational current 
densities above 1 A cm2.25 
The high performance of GDE devices has emphasized the 
importance of a plentiful supply of CO2 via a facile diffusion 
pathway. This has encouraged a CO2centric perspective on 
assessing and improving CO2R GDE performance. Here, we give 
an indepth explanation of the role of water in a CO2R GDE, in 
particular how water and solute activities likely regulate CO2R 
activity and equilibrium potentials in the CL, and what further 
computational and experimental work is needed to understand 
and further optimize the activity of this important chemical 
reaction.
