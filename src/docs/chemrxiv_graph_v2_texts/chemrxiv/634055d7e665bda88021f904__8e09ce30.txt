Description:
Recognized as one of the most recyclable plastics due to the vast presence of mechanical recycling industries.

Text:
The inexpensive manufacturing, longterm durability, and high resistance to degradation of 
plastics has led to its concerning accumulation as waste in landfills and oceans at rates that 
parallel its annual production.1 The primary sources of plastic waste are singleuse or short
lifetime consumer plastics, mainly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and 
polypropylene (PP), with PET being the predominant polymer in postconsumer domestic 
plastic waste collected in countries such as the UK (40 abundance).2 
Although PET is recognized as one of the most recyclable plastics due to the vast presence 
of mechanical recycling industries, it can only endure a limited number of cycles before its 
properties are compromised.
