Description:
Recovered from polystyrene waste through thermal or thermocatalytic decomposition for recycling.

Text:
Plastic waste has become a global environmental concern, 
with more than 300 million tons of petroleumbased syn
thetic plastics industrially produced worldwide every year. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the major sources of plastic prod
ucts in the world. Due to its high durability, easy processa
bility and hydrolytic stability, PS is widely used in packag
ing, insulation, building and food processing industries 
and thus has become a major pollutant of soils, rivers, 
lakes, and oceans.1 
The most common chemical approach to recycle polysty
rene waste is thermal or thermocatalytic decomposition 
that leads either to fuellike products2 or to closeloop re
cycling through the recovery of styrene monomer3.
