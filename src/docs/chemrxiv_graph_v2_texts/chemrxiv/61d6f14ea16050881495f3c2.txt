Description:
Forms strong solvates with trivalent lanthanides.

Text:
The metalligand interactions in trivalent lanthanide com
plexes are often regarded purely as electrostatic. In spite of this, 
the trivalent lanthanides form strong solvates in e.g. water, 
DMSO, and methanol.16 It is not uncommon that these un
charged solvent ligands outcompete negatively charged anions, 
forming outersphere complexes with an inner coordination 
sphere composed purely of coordinating solvent. More strongly 
coordinating ligands can outcompete the solvent and coordinate 
directly to the metal ion. As no bonding occurs, these types of 
interactions would typically be described in terms of ion pairs.7 
In order to understand the solution chemistry of the Ln3 ions 
we must consider these ion pairing effects. Marcus  Hefter7 categorize three different ion pair types 
solvent separated, solvent shared, and close contact ion pairs.
