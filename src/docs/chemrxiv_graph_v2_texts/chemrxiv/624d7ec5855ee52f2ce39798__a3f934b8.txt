Description:
A molecule that can bind to enzymes but may not convert substrates.

Text:
If GtPyNP could bind but not convert 1a, we 
reasoned that the position of the equilibrium between 1a and 
1a would determine the ratio of potentially active enzyme (1a 
bound to GtPyNP) versus inactive enzyme (1a bound to 
GtPyNP), assuming that catalysis is a ratelimiting step. Given 
the highly solventexposed active site of pyrimidine nucleoside 
phosphorylases in the open state, we expected that GtPyNP 
should be able to accommodate the slightly twisted and 
sterically more demanding borate ester 1a and allow its 
equilibration with the free nucleoside substrate 1a while bound 
to the enzyme. Phenomenologically, such a process would 
resemble a classical noncompetitive inhibition, consistent 
with our kinetic data.

Description:
A compound studied in complex with uridine using MD simulations based on a crystal structure.

Text:
Indeed, MD simulations (using 
GROMACS59,60 with the CHARMM3661 force field) based on 
our recently disclosed crystal structure of GtPyNP in complex 
with uridine (PDB ID 7m7k,4 see the SI for details) yielded 
several insights in support of the proposed model. First, an 
analysis of the clustered states over 50 ns simulation time
