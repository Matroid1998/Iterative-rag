tion photoactivated water splitting on small Ru clusters8
and O2 dissociation on small Au particles9. In both stud
ies, the small clusters have been supported on a solvated
oxide surfaces. Other studies investigate directly the
nanoparticlewater interface structure with heavy sim
ulations but are limited to structure optimisation,10 im
plicit solvation,11 or short sampling duration.12 Molec
ular mechanics (MM) simulations could be employed to
lower the cost of the sampling. However, adapted force
elds that deliver relevant structures and surface solva
tion for nanoparticles hardly exist.
