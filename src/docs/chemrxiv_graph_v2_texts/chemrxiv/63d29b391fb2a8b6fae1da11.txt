Description:
A kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA for applications in oncology.

Text:
In the two decades since the FDAapproved imatinib more than 70 kinase inhibitors, mostly
for applications in oncology, have been approved and many more inhibitors are in (pre)clinical
pipelines.6,7 Despite the success, there is still a need for more selective compounds, for socalled
polypharmacological compounds, which modulate multiple targets, and for compounds, which
can inhibit mutant kinases to address resistance. However, the development of a new drug from
earlystage drug discovery to clinical development is a challenging and expensive process that
takes on average more than ten years and costs more than two billion dollars.8
Computeraided drug design (CADD) can reduce these costs by decreasing the number of
compounds to be synthesised and the number of experiments needed, especially when applied
in earlystage drug discovery.
