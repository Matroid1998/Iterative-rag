Description:
A stabilizing ligand that strongly inhibits the catalytic activity of Au NPs.

Text:
The supported catalysts often exhibit decreased 
activity as compared to colloidal NPs,31 and suffer from nanoparticle migration and aggregation, 
irregular distribution and regrowth, and weak affinity of metal NPs to supports, resulting in increased 
leaching.2 The applicability of MOFembedded metal NP in catalysis is often limited due to MOF 
stability issues under catalytic conditions.32 Finally, the surface capping agents can not only inhibit 
aggregation but also block the active sites on the NP surface, leading to reduced catalytic 
activities.23,24,33 A typical example would be the strongly inhibiting effect of lowweight thiolated 
polyethylene glycol (HSPEG) as stabilizing ligand on the catalytic activity of Au NPs towards the 
reduction of 4nitrophenol.23 Considering the aforementioned aspects, the development of new 
stabilizers that can effectively stabilize metal NPs without blocking the active sites and the diffusion 
of the reactants and products to and from the metal surface is of paramount importance in catalysis.
