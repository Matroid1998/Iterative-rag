Description:
A feedstock in the Haber-Bosch process, typically sourced from fossil fuels.

Text:
Ammonia is critical to our food production ecosystem1,2 and the 
single most produced polluting chemical (170 million tons per 
year)35, while also holding the potential to become one of the most 
promising carbonfree and lowcost long term energy carrier6,7. The 
industrial HaberBosch (HB) process employs a Febased catalyst, 
fossilfuel sourced H2, and requires harsh operating conditions 
(typically 673723 K and 100300 bar of pressure). The largescale 
and centralized HB process accounts for nearly 2 of the worlds 
consumption of fossil fuels8, and consequently over 1.44 of the 
global anthropogenic CO2 emissions5. The development of small
scale processes that rely on renewable electricity as an energy source 
to sustainably produce the H2 feedstock would thus be 
transformative in several ways.

Description:
Oversaturation is avoided in the production of NH3 by ternary ruthenium complex hydrides.

Text:
In this paper, we present the reaction mechanism facilitating ternary 
ruthenium complex hydrides to successfully produce NH3 at low 
temperature (448 K  T  573 K) by selective N2 activation and 
escaping H2 oversaturation. This work shows the unique ability of 
the RuH64 catalytic center in the ternary ruthenium hydride to shift 
its ratedetermining intermediate states and transition states of the 
N2H2 to NH3 reaction path in response to the lowering of the 
reaction temperature, which brings a significant change in reaction 
order of hydrogen and ammonia. This variation in the kinetics as a 
function of operating conditions (temperature, reactant partial 
pressures, etc.) is not a common phenomenon in catalysis but is 
observed in some cases 1923.
