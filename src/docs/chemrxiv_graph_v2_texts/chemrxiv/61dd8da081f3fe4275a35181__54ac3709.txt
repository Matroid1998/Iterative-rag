Description:
A precursor composite whose Rutile core and Anatase shell thickness can be tuned by adjusting calcination temperature.

Another aspect of the studies on TiO2 deals with doping with hetero atoms like C, N, S and others, in these studies it has been reported 
that the reason for doping with these elements is to shift the photon absorption to visible region. This aspect has been examined recently 
30 
in a review8. These studies must be considered in the light of the observations recorded that the coexistence of Rutile and Anatase 
phases and the depth of Rutile core and Anatase shell can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of TiOxCy (x  y) and TiOxCy (x  y) in 
the precursor composite by a change of the calcinations temperature1.
