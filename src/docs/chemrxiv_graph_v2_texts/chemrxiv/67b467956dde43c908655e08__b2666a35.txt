Description:
Used for ultrasensitive radioimaging and radiotherapy.

Complexes of the highly 
paramagnetic Gd(III) cation are wellestablished in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 177Lu(III) is well
established for ultrasensitive radioimaging as well as 
radiotherapy.5c,6d 
However, a major challenge with applications of 
lanthanide luminescence is the darkness of the 4f4f 
transition that gives rise to the emissive excited state. Since 
the transition is Laporte forbidden, it can only be 
significantly populated via intersystem crossing from a 
separate chromophore  an antenna.7 This wellknown 
antenna effect can at the same time be viewed as a limitation 
and an opportunity; while the strict distance dependence is 
a limiting factor in probe emitter design, it can also be used 
to construct dynamic and switchable sensors.
