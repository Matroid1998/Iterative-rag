Description:
A valuable hydrogenation product of vanillin.

Text:
The hydrogenation 
of vanillin as a lignin model has been a hot topic of research in the catalysis 
community.6 Vanillin has the potential to be upgraded to valueadded compounds by 
catalytic hydrogenation and its valuable hydrogenation products are typically vanillyl 
alcohol (VA) and 4methyl guaiacol (MMP). During the subsequent processing of bio
oils, thermally unstable compounds such as aldehydes, acids and sugars tend to cause 
catalyst coking and need to be converted to stable compounds (e.g.

alcohols and 
diols).7.These alcohols are more conducive to the subsequent processing of biooils 
with increased hydrogen content 8.Vanillyl alcohol is also more costly and expensive to 
produce than vanillin and can be used directly as a flavouring 9.MMMP can be used as 
a fuel additive or food flavouring agent10,and is also widely used as an intermediate for 
flavours or drugs and fragrances11.The difficulty in this reaction is the selectivity 
control of the hydrogenation products. The catalysts typically used for the reduction of 
vanillin are divided into two main categories, noble metals and transition metals. The 
usual noble metal catalystsAu12, Ru13, Pd14due to their excellent catalytic reduction 
ability, will strip off O in one step during the reaction to produce 4methyl guaiacol 
(MMP).
