Description:
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, known for their multiple fused aromatic rings and environmental persistence.

Text:
Helicenes are an interesting class of adsorbates due to their molecular chirality, the formation of 
 selfassembled monolayers upon adsorption on metallic substrates, the chiral polymorphism of 
 the assembled patterns, and their intriguing optical properties. 1,1315 Structurally, they are 
 highlyconjugated, orthofused, chiral, aromatic hydrocarbons. 13,16 The chirality of helicenes, 
 despite the lack of a chiral center, arises from the fusion of benzene rings in the ortho position, 
 such that they adopt a chiral helical topology when the backbone is large enough to encounter 
 steric repulsion of the two ends. 1,16 As chiral PAHs, helicenes can facilitate asymmetric and
