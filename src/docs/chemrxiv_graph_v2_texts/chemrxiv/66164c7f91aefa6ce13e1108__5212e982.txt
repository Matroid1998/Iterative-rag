Description:
The main component of belite cements, also known as belite or C2S in cement chemistry notation.

But there is a third alternative that
33
researchers have long pursued the socalled belite cements.4
34
Belite cements (BCs) are, as the name indicates, cements in which the main component
35
is dicalcium silicate (also known as belite or C2S in cement chemistry notation), in contrast
36
to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in which tricalcium silicate or alite predominates. Due
37
to its lower Ca content, BCs require less limestone, reducing by up to 13 the OPC CO2
38
emissions upon calcination. Furthermore, the sintering temperature is lower, also reducing
39
fuel consumption.
