surface interactions 28, making the electronic properties of TMDs
highly sensitive to surface interactions and expanding their potential
for diverse applications 415. Although 2D TMD surfaces are chemically inert, they can still
be effectively utilized in electrocatalysis due to the presence of active
sites located at the coordinatively unsaturated metal centers along the
edges or introduced through defects such as chalcogen vacancies 29
36. As a result, MoX2 sheets serve as electrocatalysts in a variety of
crucial chemical processes.
