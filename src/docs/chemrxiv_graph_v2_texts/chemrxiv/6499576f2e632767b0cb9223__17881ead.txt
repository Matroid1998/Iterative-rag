Description:
Used as the heteroatom source in visible-light-mediated dual copper catalysis.

One of 
the classical methods is the Meerwein arylation that involves a re
ductive generation of aryl radicals from highly reactive precursors 
(aryldiazonium or diaryliodonium salts), followed by radicalpolar 
crossover and trapping of the resulting carbocation with excess nu
cleophiles.9 In 2021, the Gaunt group reported an excellent study 
on the vicinal azidoarylation of alkenes using diaryliodonium salts 
as aryl radical sources and NaN3 as the heteroatom source, via a 
visiblelightmediated dual copper catalysis, to access aryl az
idoalkanes.10 However, the use of these reactive radical precursors 
presents challenges for the latestage modification of complex bio
active molecules due to difficulties in accessing them. Conversely, 
readily available (hetero)arenes, which are prevalent in pharmaceu
tically relevant molecules, represent ideal aryl radical precursors 
(Figure 1C).
