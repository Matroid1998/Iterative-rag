Description:
Coating additives that improve specific capacity and capacity retention in thiophosphate-based SSBs.

Text:
Highvoltage cathodes coated with metal oxides and phosphates show 
improved specific capacity, and capacity retention compared with uncoated counterparts in 
thiophosphatebased SSBs. However, these coating additives exhibit either limited Liion 
conductivity (104 Scm), or insufficient stability against highvoltage cathode. Halides, in particular chlorides, such as Li3InCl6 (LIC)13, Li3YCl14, Li3TiCl615 and 
Li3xM1xZrxCl6 (M  Y, Er)16, have gained considerable attention by combining both, 
high Liion conductivities (0.1 mScm) and highvoltage stability (4.2 V vs LiLi). Nevertheless, their instability when paired with Li anode17 and relatively high production 
costs limit their application as bulk solid electrolytes. This is, when used as catholyte or in 
particular coating additive, however, less relevant, which makes them a promising 
alternative.
