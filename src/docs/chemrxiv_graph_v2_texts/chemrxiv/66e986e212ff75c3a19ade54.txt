Description:
Reduction potential becomes more negative as the number of fluorine atoms decreases, making monofluorinated compounds challenging for single-electron transfer methods.

However, these photoredoxcatalyzed methods have pre
dominantly focused on trifluoromethylsubstituted arenes 
and trifluoroacetic acid derivatives, utilizing potent reduct
ants, such as excitedstate transition metal complexes,1521 
CO2 radical anions, or photoexcited organic catalysts.2243 
(Figure 1A). This focus is understandable, as the relatively positive re
duction potentials of trifluoromethyl arenes (1.8 V vs 
SCE)34 and trifluoroacetic acid derivatives (2.0 V vs SCE)38 
make them more accessible to singleelectron transfer 
(SET)based strategies (Figure 1B). However, as the num
ber of fluorine decreases, the reduction potential similarly 
becomes more negative, rendering monofluorinated com
pounds particularly challenging substrates for SETbased 
methods.
