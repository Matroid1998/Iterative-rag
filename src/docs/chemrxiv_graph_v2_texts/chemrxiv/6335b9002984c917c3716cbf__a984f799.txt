Description:
Atoms that modulate physicochemical properties when introduced near heteroatoms.

Text:
Fluorinated functional groups are typically used by the medicinal and agricultural 
chemistry 
communities 
to 
influence 
the 
physicochemical, 
pharmacokinetic, 
and 
pharmacodynamic properties of small molecules.13 Thus, catalytic methods for preparing 
medicinally relevant fluorinated substructures have received substantial attention from the 
synthetic community.46 Since many of a molecules physicochemical properties are affected by 
heteroatomcontaining functional groups, the introduction of one or more fluorine atoms in the 
vicinity of a heteroatom readily modulates these properties.7 For example, the introduction of two 
fluorine atoms alpha to the sulfur atom of a thioether reduces sulfurs nucleophilicity and increases 
its oxidative stability relative to the nonfluorinated counterpart.8 Such changes in the 
physicochemical properties of sensitive thioethers encourages the development of a general and 
convergent catalytic strategy for accessing a,adifluoroalkylthioethers. Figure 1 Hydrothiolation of gemDifluoroalkenes
