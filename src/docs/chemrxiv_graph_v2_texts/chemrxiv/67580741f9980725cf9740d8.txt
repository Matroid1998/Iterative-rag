Description:
Exhibits fractal aggregation and increased interfacial area per nanoparticle at lower temperatures, with anisotropic and fully closed conformation at higher temperatures.

Text:
Extended PNIPAM at lower 
temperatures caused fractal aggregation and increased the interfacial area per nanoparticle in 
Langmuir layers. The results indicated nanoparticles Januslike conformation as the most 
probable, with polymeric ligands being open below and closed above the water surface. On 
the contrary, the conformation remained more anisotropic and fully closed at higher 
temperatures. No interdigitation and no internanoparticulate bonds between PNIPAM ligands 
were observed. The most exciting observation was that the films were more compact and 
ordered at a higher temperature. The surface pressure decreased at a higher temperature, i.e., 
behaved oppositely to classical systems.14
