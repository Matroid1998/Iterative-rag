Description:
An abbreviation for triclosan, used as a disinfectant and preservative in various products.

Text:
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have attracted considerable attention 
as emerging environmental contaminants.13 Within this very diverse group of species with 
varying physico and biochemical properties, the chlorinated biphenyl ether triclosan 
(C12H7Cl3O2, 5chloro2(2,4dichlorophenoxy)phenol, abbreviated TCS or, less frequently, 
TCL) is often named as one species of particular concern.47 Due to its antimicrobial and 
antifungal properties, TCS is not only used as a disinfectant in health care settings, but also in 
a large variety of personal care products, such as soaps, deodorants, or toothpastes, and as 
a preservative in household items.79 Since potential risks to human health, including 
reproductive problems and enhanced risk of asthma and allergies, have been identified, the 
use of TCS in consumer products has been restricted in several countries.7,9 Given the 
persistence of TCS, which is stable to hydrolysis at nearneutral pH values.

Description:
An antimicrobial that may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and has potential environmental impact.

Text:
These 
include acute toxicity to aquatic organisms (however, at concentrations that are typically not 
reached in realworld scenarios15), chronic toxicity, and endocrinedisrupting effects.5 
Moreover, the antimicrobial TCS may contribute to selection processes that are responsible 
for the development of antibioticresistant bacteria.5,8,16 Due to the frequent presence of 
relatively low levels of antibiotics and disinfectants in wastewaters and wastewater treatment 
plants (WTTPs), these have been identified as hot spots for the development of microbial 
resistance.17 Hence, the frequent presence of TCS in such environments should be a cause 
for concern, not only due to its potential environmental impact, but also with regard to possible, 
more indirect consequences for human health. Nonnegligible amounts of TCS can also be 
found in soils amended with biosolids from wastewater treatment plants.
