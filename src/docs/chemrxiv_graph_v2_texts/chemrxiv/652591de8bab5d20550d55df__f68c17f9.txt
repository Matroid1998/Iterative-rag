Catalysts with metal centers coordinated by pyrrolic nitrogen atoms, used in fuel cells and water electrolysis.

The Hydrogen Economy scheme is based on the idea that surplus energy from intermittent sustainable 
sources could be used to generate hydrogen as a green energy carrier which could be used for a wide 
variety of applications. At the heart of this scheme are electrolyzer technologies which electrocatalytically 
produce hydrogen from water for later use in power to X1,2 and power to metal3 applications, or in fuel 
cell electric vehicles4,5. A group of catalysts that holds great promise for fuel cells611 and water 
electrolysis1214 are MetalNitrogenCarbon (MNC; M  Co, Fe, Ni, Mo, Mn) catalysts. Structural 
characterization led to the conclusion that metal centers coordinated by four pyrrolic nitrogen atoms act 
as catalytically active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).1517 However, MNC catalysts often 
contain multiple metal speciation.
