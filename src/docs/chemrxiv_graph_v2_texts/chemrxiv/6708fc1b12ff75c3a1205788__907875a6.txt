Description:
Inorganic solids where the PAl ratio controls the formation of different phases.

Text:
In the realm of inorganic sol
ids, it has been shown that the PAl ratio controls the 
formation of A and C aluminophosphates with the 
former dominating at ratios less than 1.0.6 Interesting 
cases in the domain of molecular solids are the pro
motion of the A phase in 1,3,6substituted fulvene 
molecular glasses by the bulky substituents on the 
fulvene ring,7 and the molecular conformation influ
encing the crystallinity and luminescence of persul
furated benzenes.8 The extent of crystallinity in poly
mers is controlled by several molecular features and 
intermacromolecular interactions.
