Description:
A substrate for dehalogenation by thermostabilized HheC enzyme.

Text:
on the thermostabilization 
of HheC by combinatorial directed evolution, mutation F12Y was found to increase the enzymes thermostability 
and yielded a 1.5fold gain in specific activity in the dehalogenation of 1,3dichloropropanol.24 Similarly, mutations 
at the structurally equivalent position Y15 in AbHheG from Acidimicrobiia bacterium yielded variants with improved 
enantioselectivity in the ring opening of styrene oxide with cyanate quite recently.14 Both examples directly hint at 
the hitherto underexplored possibility to steer the catalytic properties of HHDHs via targeted mutagenesis of 
sequence motif 1. Building on these precedents, we therefore set out to systematically engineer the conserved motif 1 
residues in two representative HHDHs, HheC from A. radiobacter as well as HheG from Ilumatobacter coccineus.
