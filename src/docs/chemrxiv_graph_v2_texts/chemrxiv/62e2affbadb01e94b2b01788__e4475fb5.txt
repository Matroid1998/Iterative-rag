Description:
Coreshell nanoparticles used in CO2 electroreduction with selectivity dependent on Sn shell thickness.

Text:
23 investigated CO2ER on 
CuSnO2 coreshell nanoparticles with various Sn shell thickness, finding the selectivity to strongly depend on 
said thickness, with thicker Sn shells showing Snlike activity with high HCOO selectivity (FE 90), while 
thinner shell exhibited a high CO selectivity (FE 93). Moreover, our recently published work17 reported a 
similar behavior for Cu nanowires coated with ultrathin SnOx layers grown using atomic layer deposition, and 
detailed Xray spectroscopic investigation revealed differing Sn speciation (i.e. oxidation state) between the CO 
and HCOOselective catalysts. In those previous studies, the general trend is that CuIn and CuSn catalysts with low In and Sn contents (Cu
rich catalysts) are COselective, while those with high Sn and In contents (Cupoor catalysts) showed a higher 
tendency toward HCOO.
