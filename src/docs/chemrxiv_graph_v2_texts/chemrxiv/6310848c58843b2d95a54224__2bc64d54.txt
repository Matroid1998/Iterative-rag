Description:
A known angular structure that serves as a basis for the heteroatom variation in triquinazine.

Text:
We compared MFs of GDB13s molecules with those derived from 885 
million commercially available screening compounds from the ZINC database,10 from 100 million 
molecules up to 50 nonhydrogen atoms (heavy atom count HAC  50) in the public database 
PubChem,11 and from 400 thousand natural products and natural productlike molecules in the 
COCONUT database.12 
MFs define molecular series by their constitutive ring systems and linker bonds compatible 
with any number of variations in substituents and heteroatoms, and lead to a more demanding definition 
of novelty.13,14 For example, our recently reported triquinazine scaffold 1, inspired from the ring system 
database GDB4c,15 represents a new heteroatom variation of the MF of the known angular triquinane 2, 
but is not a new MF per se, however the derived Janus kinase inhibitor 3 features an unprecedented MF 
4 occurring only in 7 molecules recorded in PubChem which correspond to the record of 3 and related
