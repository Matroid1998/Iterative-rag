Description:
Used in combination with pretomanid and linezolid for treatment of pulmonary extensively drug resistant tuberculosis.

Text:
Tuberculosis is one of the leading global causes of mortality, 
and it is believed that one third of the population has a latent 
case of the disease.1 Pretomanid is a therapy for treatment of 
tuberculosis, and was recently approved by the US FDA 
under the Limited Population Pathway (LPAD Pathway) for 
treatment of pulmonary extensively drug resistant (XDR) 
tuberculosis in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid. It works as a respiratory poison against bacteria by releasing 
nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions. Given the large quantities of drug substance that could be 
required, costeffective syntheses are needed. A key feature 
of pretomanid is the dihydro1,3oxazine, containing an 
oxygensubstituted asymmetric center on the C3 unit (Figure 
1).
