Description:
Organically modified silica used to entrap silver nanoparticles.

Text:
Introduced in 2020, SilverSil is a broad scope antibacterial solgel material whose 
antibacterial activity so far has been demonstrated in vitro 1. Consisting of 
organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) entrapping silver nanoparticles (NPs) originally 
derived from methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) 1. Colloidal silver (i.e., silver NPs) is a powerful antimicrobial of broad scope and low 
toxicity whose mechanism of action minimizes antimicrobial resistance 2. Accordingly, it comprises the active pharmaceutical ingredient of numerous 
antimicrobial commercial products widely used across the world since more than a 
century. Along with Albo and Trebelsi, we have suggested elsewhere that 
antimicrobial formulations based on microencapsulated Ag NPs will be amid next
generation antimicrobials 3.

Description:
Materials with a tunable hydrophilic-lipophilic balance, ideally suited for drug release.

Text:
This is particularly relevant in sight of practical applications of these coatings, 
because the hydrophiliclipophilic balance of ORMOSIL can be widely tuned thanks 
to the unique versatility of silicon alkoxide chemistry 6, making these materials 
ideally suited for drug release 7. In this study, we report the outcomes of solgel 
material chemistry research applied to the SilverSil class of materials in view of 
practical applications aimed at developing practically useful SilverSil coatings for a 
wide variety of applications. Along with that of MTES, we investigate the use of 3
(aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) to prepare new SilverSil coatings. In 2011, 
indeed, Chen and coworkers reported the excellent antibacterial performance of an 
ORMOSIL derived from TEOS and 3(2aminoethylaminopropyl)trimethoxysilane 
subsequently impregnated with Ag NPs 8.
