Description:
A chiral complex used to catalyze intramolecular aziridination of alkenes with sulfonamides and carbamates.

Text:
In 2003, Che developed a chiral dirhodium complex to catalyze intramolecular aziridination of 
alkenes with sulfonamides and carbamates in up to 76 ee.25 Dauban later used a copperBOX complex to afford 
the intramolecular aziridination of sulfamates in up to 84 ee, although substrates bearing unconjugated or terminal 
olefins gave less satisfactory results.26 In 2017, Zhang used an alternative strategy to iminoiodinanebased nitrene 
formation, reporting enantioselective aziridinations with allyl azidoformates via a radical pathway catalyzed by a 
cobaltporphyrin complex.27 This catalyst gave excellent enantioselectivity when substrates containing (E)olefins
