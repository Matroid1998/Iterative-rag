Description:
Sublimation rates for graphitic nanoparticles at 1700 K are substantially faster than for bulk graphite.

Text:
To enable 
study of these effects, we have developed an approach to measuring 
surface reaction kinetics for individual NPs, held in an 
electrodynamic trap.45 
For example, we previously found that sublimation of graphitic 
NPs at temperatures (TNP)  1700 K was substantially faster than 
the rates for bulk graphite,68 varied by up to an order of magnitude 
from NPtoNP, and slowed significantly over time, correlated with 
increases in optical emissivity.

Description:
A form of carbon involved in oxidation processes.

Text:
Surprisingly, it was also found that graphitic NPs eventually 
evolved to be essentially inert to O2 in the 1200 to 1900 K range, 
implying that the number of exposed reactive sites dropped to near 
zero. It was speculated that his evolution to O2 inertness resulted 
from a transformation of at least the surface layer, to nanoonion 
(multiwall fullerene) structure. This interpretation of the previous results, as well as results 
presented below, relies on extensive literature on oxidation of 
various forms of carbon, particularly graphite, some of which is 
discussed in the SI.

Description:
Perfect basal planes have near-zero reactivity towards O2, but etching occurs at defects and prismatic surfaces.

Text:
Briefly, etching is O2 dissociative adsorption, 
followed by COCO2 desorption, and the decrease at higher TNP has 
been attributed to competition from Oatom desorption.910 Surface 
chemistry studies have shown that perfect graphite basal planes 
have nearzero reactivity towards O2 in this temperature range,1112 
but etching is observed at sputterinduced basal plane defects1317 
and at prismatic surfaces,18 which expose basal plane edges. For 
example, Olander et al.11 observed etching at sputtered basal plane 
defects from 1400  1500 K at O2 fluxes of 100 O2 
collisionsecnm2, about 30 lower than our flux.

Description:
Undergoes etching with O2, with rates peaking at high temperatures.

Text:
Etching at 
defects tends to expand the defects laterally, leading to 2D etch pit 
formation.1317 For example, Edel et al.17 studied pit formation 
during HOPG etching to peak at 1200  1400 K, using O2 fluxes of 
0.1 O2 collisionssecnm2. It is interesting to note that the TNP 
range where we observe the maximum etching rates is similar to 
the range seen in the surface chemistry experiments, but also in 
experiments with bulk graphite at much higher pressures. For 
example, Wall et al.19 observed the steady state etching rates for 
bulk graphite to peak between 1700  1900 K, and Rosner et al.20 
observed peaks in the 1500 to 1750 K range, with O2 partial
