They are considered 
37 
interesting alternatives to biological thioesters for prebiotic peptide ligation, and can be ligated into 
38 
peptide with the aid of an oxidizing catalyst, such as ferricyanide.710 However, high concentrations 
39 
of reactants and catalysts are typically required for these oxidative peptide ligations, which may 
40 
not have been easy to reach. Recent work has demonstrated that some microcompartments and 
41 
protocell systems could compartmentalize (bio)chemical reactions, and act as catalytic 
42 
microreactors or reaction localization centers with potential for prebiotic peptide ligation.1116 
43 
In particular, membraneless compartments based on complex coacervates have been 
44 
considered as versatile protocell models in the origins of life research.5,1619 Coacervate droplets
