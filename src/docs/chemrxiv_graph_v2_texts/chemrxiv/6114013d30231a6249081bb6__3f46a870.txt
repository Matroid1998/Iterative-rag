Description:
Used as a reductive condition in chemical processes.

While the two approaches have somewhat similar effects on the 
materials optical properties if carried out under inert or reductive (NH3, H2) conditions7, 
13 or under vacuum,14 the reports on the performance of the resulting photocatalysts in 
terms of activity or visiblelight response are contradictory and show little consensus 
regarding the optimal thermal treatment conditions. For example, Wang et al. reported a 
continuous increase of the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate with increasing temperature 
of PCN condensation up to 700 C.12 In accord with this result, P. Niu et al.
