Description:
A fluorescent molecular rotor used for DNA sensing with low intrinsic fluorescence in the unbound state and increased emission upon DNA binding.

Fluorescent probes are critical tools for detecting and 
sensing 
the 
structure, 
dynamics, 
and 
binding 
interactions of nucleic acids.13 Fluorescent molecular 
rotors (FMRs), such as thioflavinT (ThT),4 and cyanine 
dye types,5 are extensively utilized for DNA sensing 68 
because they possess segmental mobility, with low 
intrinsic fluorescence in the unbound state, with large 
emission intensity upon DNA binding due to enhanced 
dye rigidity.9,10 They are commercially available, or 
readily synthesized, making them simple to employ.11 
However, because they are free in solution, they can 
suffer from false readouts, slow response times, and 
do not provide sitespecific information. Internal FMRs remediate labelfree drawbacks due to 
sitespecific attachment to nucleic acids.
