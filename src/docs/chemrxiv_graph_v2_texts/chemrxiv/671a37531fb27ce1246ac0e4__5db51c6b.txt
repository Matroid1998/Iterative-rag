Description:
In monolayer form, it has a direct bandgap, whereas in bulk form, it has an indirect bandgap.

These materials have a wide range of optical 811,
electrical 12, 13, and mechanical properties 1416. Properties of monolayer TMDs tend to differ from
those of their layered bulk structures 17, 18. For
example, bulk WS2 has a indirect bandgap, whereas
monolayer WS2 has a direct bandgap 19. Furthermore,
the properties of TMD monolayers can differ dramati
cally depending on both the metal, chalcogenide, crystal
phase, and stacking pattern that is present 20. For
example, 1TTiS2 is metallic whereas 1TTiSe2 is a
semimetal 21, 22. This breadth of material properties
leads to a diversity of possible applications.

Description:
A tungsten dichalcogenide important for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, spintronics, gas sensors, and antibacterial activity.

Tungsten
TMDs
(WS2,
WSe2,
WTe2;
henceforth
collectively denoted as WX2) are important for appli
cations in catalysis 2325, optoelectronics 26, 27,
spintronics 28, 29, gas sensors 3032, antibacterial
activity 33, 34, etc. Moreover, there are a wide range
of methods available to synthesise these materials such
as chemical vapour deposition 3537, atomic layer
deposition 38, 39, and exfoliation 40.This makes
tungsten TMDs useful as engineering materials, rather
than just as simple model systems. Many technologies, including energy conversion and
electronics, are dependent on metals deposited onto
substrates. The resulting morphology of the metal on
the substrate determines the possible application of
metalsubstrate combinations 41.
