Description:
Involved in a test suggesting exchange via a SNAr pathway.

Text:
Despite the recent achievements of their CH functionalizations,7 only rare cases of direct 
deuteration of nitroaromatics have been reported.8 For instance, apart from the first direct deuteration of 
nitroaromatics catalyzed by electronrich Iridium complex (Scheme 1A),9 a recent mechanistic study indicated the 
potential of higher deuteration activity of AgO than Pd(OAc)2.8b The subsequent test with K2CO3 suggested that the 
exchange may happen via a SNAr pathway. This interesting finding encouraged us to hypothesize the electronrich 
silvercomplex could facilitate the HIE of electrodeficient nitroaromatics. Noticeably, similar strategy of silver
