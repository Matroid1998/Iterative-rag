Description:
Currently one of the best organic catholyte candidates due to its persistence and ability to undergo reversible one-electron oxidation.

However, due partly to 
their unique and complex chemistry, relatively few stable 
radicalcontaining materials have been explored.7,8 As a re
sult, most studies have focused on chemical modifications 
of a handful of wellknown stable radical scaffolds,9,10 pri
marily via mechanismbased approaches that identify opti
mal sidechains to improve performance such as increasing 
solubility or limiting possible decomposition reactions.1118 
The scarcity of radical scaffolds complicates the tuning of 
their physical and electrochemical properties to meet the 
strict demands of highperformance, lowcost RFBs.2,3 For 
example, TEMPO (2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidineNoxyl) is 
currently one of the best organic catholyte candidates due 
to its persistence and ability to undergo reversible oneelec
tion oxidation (Fig. 1).
