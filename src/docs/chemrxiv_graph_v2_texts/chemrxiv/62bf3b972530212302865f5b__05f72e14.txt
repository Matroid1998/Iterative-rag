Description:
A compound whose surface structures are systematically searched for stability, considering hydrogen presence.

Text:
Since hydrogen is present in
MOVPE and CBE, it can be expected to be present at
the AlInP surface as well 9, 10. Therefore, we here extend the previous study 8 to ac
count for the possibility of surface adsorbed hydrogen. A systematic search for stable Al0.5In0.5P(001) surface
structures is performed, where the existence of hydrogen
is considered as an additional degree of freedom. The
initial geometries for structure optimization are gener
ated by systematically varying the surface stoichiometry
of both CuPtA and CuPtB type ordered Al0.5In0.5P
crystals. Altogether, more than 80 surfaces are probed
computationally. The computational predictions for typ
ical MOVPE growth conditions are compared with low
energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Xray photoelec
tron spectroscopy (XPS) data measured on epitaxially
grown Al0.52In0.48P(001) samples.
