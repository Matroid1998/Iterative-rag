Description:
A material with a crystal structure that can incorporate fluoride ions.

Text:
The first observation 
of such a building unit in the crystal structure of an assynthesized allsilica zeolite was reported 
in 1995 for nonasil (NON framework type code10),11 followed by analogous findings for various 
other zeolites.1221,22 The body of crystal structure data shows a preference of fluoride to bond to 
Si atoms that are part of small rings, most typically fourmembered rings (4MRs) or, if these are 
not present in the structure, 5MRs. To complement crystallographic investigations, a few authors have employed computational 
methods to compare different possible fluoride locations within a given zeolite In particular, 
Pulido et al.
