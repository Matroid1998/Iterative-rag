Description:
Organic molecules used to modify metallic surfaces, forming monolayers important for applications in biosensing, catalysis, and interfacial charge transport.

Text:
Controlling the structural physical and chemical properties of the interface can be readily 
achieved by modifying the metallic surface with organic molecules among which thiol 
monolayers are of special importance13 with a wide range of applications extending from 
biosensing46, catalysis7, to interfacial charge transport811. Such monolayers allowed for 
pivotal advancements in drug delivery12, protein adsorption onto surfaces13,14, as well as basic 
research of surfaces and interfaces15, and solar cells16. Despite immense efforts to understand 
the physics behind the selfassembly of such monolayers, both theoretically17,18 and 
experimentally (including the energetic and kinetic aspects of adsorption1921, exchange2224 
and desorption25,26, locations of the exchange27,28 and its mechanism29,30), various aspects of 
the monolayer dynamics remain obscure.
