Description:
A toxic and depleted heavy metal used in organometallic homogeneous catalysts for synthesizing chiral amines.

Text:
Chemical processes dedicated to the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) 
are known to generate significant amount of waste per unit mass of product (high efactor)1. The specific case of the synthesis of chiral amines, which are essential building blocks for the 
pharmaceutical industry 24, is a prominent illustration of this issue. Industrially, the synthesis 
of chiral amines is operated via multistep batch processes which usually feature low overall 
yield, produce large amounts of waste, and are energyintensive. They are typically catalysed 
by organometallic homogeneous catalysts based on toxic and depleted heavy metals (Ru, Rh, 
Pd) which usually operate at relatively high temperature, are not 100 enantioselective, and 
are difficult to recover 5,6.
