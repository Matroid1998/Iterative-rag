Description:
A class of bioactive compounds with a conjugated amine core, used as synthetic intermediates and ligands for metal complexes.

Text:
Amidines 
are a prominent class of bioactive compounds found in a 
wide variety of natural products (scheme 1.a).810 Due to 
their common structural core decorated with three substit
uents, amidines are perfect candidates for multicomponent 
synthesis.11 Their unique structural features, stemming 
from a conjugated amine core, are at the root of numerous 
applications.10,11 In addition to their broad use as bioactive 
pharmacophores, amidines are synthetic intermediates for 
heterocyclic compounds and useful ligands for metal com
plexes.11 Nevertheless, none of the existing synthetic meth
odologies afford amidines with three aromatic substituents.

Thus, the design of a multicomponent , singlestep reaction 
to afford a diverse array of amidines, especially those with 
three aromatic substituents decorating the conjugated 
amine core, is both synthetically challenging and appealing 
as a gateway to numerous untapped applications. Scheme 1. (a) examples of bioactive compounds bearing an 
amidine core (b) selected approaches for the preparation of 
amidines and the methodology presented in this work
