Description:
Incorporation into the PMMA matrix is generally limited, irrespective of the processing temperature.

Text:
Variation of sorption, diffusion and reaction of 
TMA into this specific polymer as a function of processing parameters have been well studied.2630 
In particular, upon increasing the processing temperature, a progressive enhancement of TMA 
diffusivity is determined, but a concomitant reduction of TMA solubility and reactivity is induced, 
significantly decreasing the amount of TMA trapped into the polymer matrix. As a consequence, the 
effective incorporation of Al2O3 into the PMMA matrix is generally limited, irrespective of the 
processing temperature. Recent results have highlighted that several polymers, like poly(ethylene
