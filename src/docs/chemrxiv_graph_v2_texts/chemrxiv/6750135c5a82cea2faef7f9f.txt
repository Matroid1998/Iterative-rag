The industry is even older than the oilbased 
petrochemical industry (created suddenly between the 
1880s and the late 1920s, simultaneously in Europe, the 
USA and in Japan)3 having started in the mid 1800s using 
as raw materials numerous different natural products. According to Pollak,4 its emergence as a distinct entity 
dates back to the second half of the 1970s when a large 
pharmaceutical company was forced by insufficient internal 
production capacity to outsource the procurement of the 
precursors of highly successful active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) cimetidine to a fine chemical company 
based in Switzerland.
