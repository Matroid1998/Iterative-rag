Description:
A bulky aromatic group serving as a hydrophobic tail in Triton X100.

Whereas
surfactants
with
a
simple
hydrophobichydrophilic linear molecular structure have
generally found to form coreshell organizations, less is
known about the assemblies of surfactant molecules with
more complex molecular geometry. An example is Triton
X100
(TX100)
which
contains
a
bulky
aromatic
tetramethylbutylphenyl
group
as
a
hydrophobic
tail
connected to a hydrophilic oligoethylene oxide (EO) of 9 or
10 units in length (Figure 2b, inset). This amphiphilicity
causes the molecules to form micellar structures above a
relatively low critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.2
to 0.3 mm at 20 C. TX100 is one of the most widely used
