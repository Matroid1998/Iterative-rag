Description:
A compound for which synthesis of pure rsZnO remains a major challenge.

Text:
This problem has been solved in 
the case of nanocrystalline diamond,5 boron nitride,6 and stishovite,7 i.e., in the cases where the phases 
can be easily recovered at ambient conditions, one only need to optimize the tpT conditions of direct 
solidstate phase transformations in order to ensure nanostructuring of a highpressure phase. However, 
in the case of zinc oxide, this approach has not worked so far, and synthesis of pure rsZnO remains a 
major challenge, as does understanding of the properties of rsZnObased materials (nanocomposites, 
solid solutions with transition metals, etc.

Zinc oxide is one of the most studied wide bandgap ionic semiconductors.11 At ambient conditions, 
ZnO has a wurtzite structure (P63mc) that transforms into rocksalt one (Fm3m) at pressures above 
5 GPa (the transition pressure ptr is strongly dependent on temperature, grain size, etc., while 
equilibrium transition pressure peq is only weakly dependent on T).8,1219 Upon pressure release, as
synthesized rsZnO usually reverts back to wurtzite phase,12 with significant hysteresis at temperatures 
below 1000 K. Occasionally, rsZnO can be recovered in the nanocrystalline state either in a mixture 
with wZnO or even in a pure form  in some special cases.4,13 Recently, the recovery of the rsZnO 
has been intensively studied.8,1119 It was found that macroscopic ( 100 mm3) nanocrystalline (grain 
size of 2880 nm) samples of singlephase rsZnO can be recovered at ambient conditions from 
7.7 GPa and 770820 K when wZnO nanopowders with average grain size below 45 nm and narrow 
particle size distribution are used as precursors.4,1314 The recovery of rsZnO synthesized from ball
milled wZnO (grain size  12 nm) at 15 GPa and 550 K in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) has also been 
reported.8 However, the attempts to release pressure down to 0.1 GPa in a DAC indicated that rsZnO 
could be retained as a single phase for only 10 min.15 It was assumed that only wellcrystallized
