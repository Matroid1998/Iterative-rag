Description:
Smaller cations that are coordinated with 6 oxygen anions to form BO6 corner-sharing octahedra in the perovskite structure.

Perovskites1 are a promising materials class2 for energyrelated 
applications and key to future catalysis technologies.2b 
Applications 
of 
perovskite 
oxides 
include 
environmental 
catalysis3 and electrocatalysis.2b Due to the high flexibility of the 
perovskite structure in terms of composition, an immense number 
of compounds can be obtained by combining different elements 
in ABO3 materials and by varying the stoichiometry, e.g., in AB(1
x)BxO3 or A(1x)AxBO3 systems. In the perovskite structure, 
relatively large A cations (e.g., lanthanides) occupy sites that are 
coordinated with 12 oxygen anions (O2) and smaller B cations 
(e.g., transition metals) are coordinated with 6 oxygen anions to 
form BO6 cornersharing octahedra.
