Description:
Induces decomposition of surface carbonate species.

Text:
A subsequent O2 multipulse sequence 
led to the formation of CO2, which was assigned to an O2induced decomposition of surface 
carbonate species. Similar experiments performed with CO2 or CO2containing gas mixtures 
such as COCO2 or H2CO2 revealed that also these gases lead to the deposition of Oact species 
on the Ru surface, with the amount the amount of Oact deposition (after 1000 pulses) increasing 
in the order COCO2  CO2  H2CO2  O2. To further test the interaction between CO2 and the 
catalyst surface, we also performed preliminary isotope labelling experiments, sending marked 
C18O2 pulses over the reduced catalyst surface. These measurements revealed significant 
formation of C16O18O and C16O2 species, indicative of oxygen exchange between C18O2 and 
the catalyst surface. Details about mechanistic aspects etc. remained, however, unresolved.
