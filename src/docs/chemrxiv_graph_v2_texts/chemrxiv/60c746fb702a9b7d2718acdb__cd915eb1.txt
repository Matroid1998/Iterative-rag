Description:
Poor leaving groups that require harsh conditions to equilibrate to the corresponding cyclopropanones.

A 
more common and practical approach popularized by Wasserman 
in the 1960s involves the use of alcohol adducts of cyclopropanone 
derivatives, such as cyclopropanone hemiketal 1, that can be trans
formed in situ to the corresponding strained ketone via base or 
acidinduced elimination (Scheme 1b).4d,7 Due in part to the poor 
leaving group ability of alkoxides, these unstable precursors require 
harsh conditions to equilibrate to the corresponding cyclopro
panones, which is problematic considering the kinetic instability of 
these highly strained species.
