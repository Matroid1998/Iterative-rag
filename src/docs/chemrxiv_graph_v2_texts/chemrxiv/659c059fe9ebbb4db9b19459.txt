Description:
Involved in hydrogen atom transfer reactions in proteins.

Text:
This leads to a vir
tually infinite number of possible reaction scenarios, in which re
actants represent instances within a vast chemical and conforma
tional space. As a consequence, directly computing this amount
of radical reactions by ab initio calculations is computationally
not feasible. Instead, machine learning can leverage quantum
chemical calculations by predicting reactivity based on an initial
quantum chemical data set. We here set out to predict the en
ergy barriers of hydrogen atom transfer reactions in proteins us
ing Graph Neural Networks that are trained on computed energy
barriers.
