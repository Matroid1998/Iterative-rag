Description:
A widely used metal-based chemotherapeutic active against many types of cancers.

Cancer is among the leading causes of early death in most 
countries.1 Because of the persistence, the number of types, and 
the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, there is an unwavering 
need for effective anticancer agents.2 
Currently, cisdiamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) is 
one of the most widely used metalbased chemotherapeutics, as 
it is active against many types of cancers.3,4,5,6 The efficiency of 
cisplatin continuously drives interest in selective, effective, and 
lowcost organometallic or metallodrugs.7 
To this end, polyoxometalates (POMs) are attractive 
candidates for anticancer agents.
