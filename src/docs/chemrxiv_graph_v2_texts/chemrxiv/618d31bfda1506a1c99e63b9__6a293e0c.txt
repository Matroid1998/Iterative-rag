Description:
Amide reduction can be used in the synthesis of aminomethylstrained cycloalkanes.

Text:
While the synthesis of simple unfunctionalized variants 
of aminomethylstrained cycloalkanes can be achieved via Nalkyla
tion, reductive amination or amide reduction with readily available 
strained cycloalkanecontaining starting materials, the synthesis of 
more complex, densely functionalized variants frequently requires 
multiple steps as a result of the problematic amine functionality that 
precludes the effective use many of the wellestablished ring for
mation protocols.3 
Metalcatalyzed C(sp3)H functionalization of simple mono
functionalized strained cycloalkane frameworks has emerged as a 
powerful alternative strategy (to de novo methods3) for the synthesis 
of higher order variants, in particular, on cyclopropane scaffolds 
(Fig. 1B).
