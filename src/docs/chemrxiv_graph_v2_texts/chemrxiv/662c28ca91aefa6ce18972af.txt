Description:
Used in chemical hydrogen storage and heterogeneous catalysis.

Text:
Many industrial processes are based on adsorption in these
nanoporous frameworks and are particular key to addressing contemporary challenges in the
areas such as energy production, conversion and storage, fluid separation, environmental
sciences, medicine, etc.58
In some cases, the adsorbed molecules form chemical bonds with the host material, and
some applications rely on this chemisorption, such as gas sensing, chemical hydrogen storage,
and probably most commonly, heterogeneous catalysis. On the other hand, many industrial
applications are based on the phenomenon of physisorption, where no chemical bonds are
formed and relatively weak interactions are involved (van der Waals attraction, Coulombic
interactions, etc).
