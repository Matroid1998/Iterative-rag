Description:
Used as a propellant with a broad working temperature range, though less effective than some derivatives.

In addition, these fuels possess a broader working 
temperature range than hydrazine propellants, rendering a safe use in harsh environments such as low 
temperature and heat. Despite these excellent properties, boronbased HILs holistic propellant performance 
is still inferior to hydrazine derivatives, restricting their widespread applications as rocket propellants. To 
boost the propellant performance of boronbased HILs, constantly engineering their chemical structures is 
highly necessary. Along this direction, the conventional approaches modify the anions and cations of the 
ionic liquids based on experiences and heuristics,9 and then experimentally verify the physicochemical 
properties of the synthesized compounds. However, such a trialanderror design cycle is biased by 
practitioners preferences and the variations of experimental conditions. Meanwhile, it is expensive and
