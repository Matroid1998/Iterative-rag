Description:
Hydrolyzed by ambient air humidity to form photoactive TiOH bonds.

Most artificial photosynthesis (AP) systems, including those at the forefront of research, focus on
water splitting for hydrogen production or reducing CO to basic hydrocarbons (C1C3). The ability
to synthesize longchain compounds (up to C17) offers a transformative opportunity to produce
highervalue chemicals, advancing AP technology scalability. The newly developed TiCl2phenylindole (PI) photocatalytic system uses visible light to convert
atmospheric CO and HO into multicarbon oxygenated hydrocarbons1. This breakthrough
integrates Direct Air Capture (DAC) of CO2 with conversion, addressing critical challenges in
climate change, energy sustainability, and resource efficiency. The mechanism involves forming photoactive TiOH bonds through the hydrolysis of TiCl
bonds by ambient air humidity. Upon exposure to light and air, these TiOH bonds release
hydroxyl radicals, facilitating the reduction of the titanium center (Ti TiTi).
