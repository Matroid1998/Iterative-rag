Description:
Promotes the initial corrosion of elemental iron.

Text:
Up to date the 
role of iron(II) in peptide syntheses is limited to an additive and 
surface material in COS or CO and H2S activated amino acid 
coupling by Ghadiri and Wchtershuser.2b,13 Thus, we intended 
to exploit the potential of reduced iron and iron compounds as 
coupling agents in an effective peptide synthesis starting from 
prebiotically plausible reactants (Figure 1a), 14  because the 
corrosion of iron supports the necessary dehydration in the 
peptide coupling and brings the amino acids into close proximity 
through coordination. Results and Discussion 
Initial corrosion of elemental iron is promoted by acetic acid 
(AcOH).
