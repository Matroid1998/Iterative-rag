Description:
An element used to dope valleriite in stability studies.

Text:
Few previous studies mentioned temperature effects in the formation 
and stability of valleriite 3233 have been performed with the samples contained less than 50 
of the target substance. The goal of the current research was to elucidate stability ranges and 
reactions of valleriite, including doped with Al and Li, at temperatures up to 1000 oC by 
thermogravimetry (TG, DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under inert and 
oxidizing conditions. We have also employed XPS, XRD, SEM, and TEM to characterize the 
initial materials and the final products. The results were compared with the DTA data available in 
the literature for bulk brucite, chalcopyrite, and layered double hydroxides to gain insights into 
mechanisms behind specific behavior and mutual influence of the 2D sulfide and hydroxide layers.
