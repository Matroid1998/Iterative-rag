Description:
Exhibits biological activities such as antiarrhythmic, anticancer, antiviral, antioxidative, and antibacterial.

Text:
The Piperazines or cyclizines is a cyclicorganic compound that consists of a six membered ring 
containing two opposing nitrogen atoms. Piperazine exists as small alkaline deliquescent crystals 
and was introduced as a solvent for uric acid. Inside the body the drug is partly oxidized and 
partly eliminated unchanged. Outside the body, piperazine has an ability to dissolve uric acid and 
producing a soluble urate 1,2. Piperazine derivatives used as nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors for the treatment of HIV Virus 3. Aryl piperazine derivatives exhibit a wide class of 
biological activities such as antiarrhythmic 4,5, anticancer 6,7, antiviral 8,9, antioxidative 
10, and antibacterial 11. Compounds of this type show high affinity for dopaminergic 12, 
1adrenergic 13, and serotoninergic receptors 14,15.

Description:
Derivatives evaluated in vitro against various virus classes.

Text:
A large class of aryl piperazine 
derivatives of 1,7,8,9Tetrachloro10,10dimethoxy4azatricyclo 5.2.1.02,6 dec8ene3,5
dione were evaluated in vitro against agents of different virus classes, such as the singlestranded 
RNA viruses, Yellow Fever virus and Bovine viral diarrhoea virus, both belonging to the 
Flaviviridae, a HIV1 (Retrovirus), and HBV (Hepadnavirus) 16. Complexes of 
diarylpiperidin4one were found as the new variety of antimicrobial agents with activity against 
pathogenic bacterial species and fungal strains 17. In order to analyse the effect of halogen 
substitution, in the parent molecule, the position of four chlorine atoms are replaced by bromine, 
and fluorine atoms respectively and which are designated as TCDBPAD, TCDBPAD Br and 
TCDBPAD F. The title compound was spectroscopically characterized by employing FTIR and 
FTRaman studies.
