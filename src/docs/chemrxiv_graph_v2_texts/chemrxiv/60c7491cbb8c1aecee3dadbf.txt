Given the wide occurrence of pyrrolo2,1aisoquinoline in many natural 
products and bioactive synthetic molecules of great importance as core structure 
(Figure 1), the construction of pyrroloisoquinoline derivatives has attracted 
much attention in the field of synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry.1 A 
large range of elegant methodologies has been developed, including multistep 
synthesis2, 1,3dipolar cycloaddition3, multicomponent reaction4, photoredox 
catalysisbased 
reactions5, 
electrocyclization6, 
and 
other 
protocols.7 
Apparently, construction of pyrroloisoquinolines in a direct way could avoid the 
multistep manipulation, cost of time, chemical waste and labor waste. Thus, from 
the standpoint of green chemistry and sustainable chemistry, direct synthesis of 
pyrroloisoquinoline derivatives using readily accessible starting material 
through onepot or domino reaction pathway is much desirable.
