surfactants that can control bubbling mechanics through modification of the surface tension of 
the gasliquid interface.20 In principle, the effects that bubble evolution have on the surface 
morphology during Cu electrodeposition can be tailored by increasing the pH of the solution. The reduction potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) exhibits a Nernstian shift to
