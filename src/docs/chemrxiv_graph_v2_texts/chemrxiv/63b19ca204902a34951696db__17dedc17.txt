Poor solubility of therapeutically valuable drugs as well as new potential drug candidates represents 
54 
an increasing challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. One way to tackle this problem is to make 
55 
use of sophisticated drug delivery systems (DDS) that achieve efficient transportation of the 
56 
(potentially toxic) compound to its biological target.1,2 Besides widely established vehicles like 
57 
liposomes, amphiphilic polymer micelles consisting of ABAtriblock copolymers of poly(2oxazoline)s 
58 
(pOx) and  or poly(2oxazine)s (pOzi) resemble an interesting alternative and have been shown to 
59 
provide maximum loading capacities (LC) of up to and more than 50 wt for a variety of 
60 
therapeutically valuable drugs, e.g.
