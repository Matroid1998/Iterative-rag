Description:
Used in the peroxide shunt pathway to generate Cpd I.

Text:
This is 
hampered by the need for external electron transfer part
ners and nicotinamide cofactors (NAD(P)H) to initiate reac
tions.13 Others have attempted to overcome this by reducing 
a crystal of substratebound P450s with electrons from the 
Xray beam and in certain instances this can result in oxida
tion.1416 This approach has also led to the proposed for
mation of electron density consistent with an oxyferryl (Cpd 
I), the main oxidant of the P450 catalytic cycle.17 18 
An alternate strategy to initiating enzymatic reactions in 
protein crystals of P450 enzymes is the use of the peroxide 
shunt pathway.19 The peroxide shunt pathway is able to 
generate Cpd I (Scheme 1) directly using hydrogen perox
ide.

Description:
Used to initiate reactions in P450 peroxygenases.

Text:
A small number of P450s are able to use this pathway 
for catalysis to act as peroxygenases.2026 As this shunt path
ways and these P450 peroxygenases only requires hydro
gen peroxide (H2O2) to initiate reactions, it may be possible 
to trigger in crystallo P450 reactions by simply soaking the 
crystal with peroxide. This could then potentially be used to 
trap and study the reactive intermediates involved in these 
enzyme reactions.
