Description:
Planar molecules that can tilt to form a ruffled perimeter.

Text:
The nanoring seems to have two 
ways to contract around the template (a) tilting planar 
porphyrins to the side, resulting in a ruffled perimeter, 
displacing of butadiyne linkers out of plane, as in P6I, or (b) 
bending the porphyrin skeleton to move the Zn ion away from 
the porphyrin mean plane, as in the gasphase structure. This 
difference can be seen more clearly by plotting the distance of 
the linking butadiyne carbon atoms from the mean plane of the 
zinc centers (clink, defined in Figure 3a) against the Zn to 
porphyrin plane distance, as shown in Fig. 3b (gray circles for 
P6I; cross for the gasphase structure).

Description:
Molecules that align parallel to the graphite surface in ordered arrays.

Text:
These parameters and the behavior of the crystals during 
diffraction experiments suggested formation of flat layers of 
nanorings with hexagonal symmetry, separated by disordered 
solvent and poorly ordered with respect to each other along the 
unique axis. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has shown that 
templatefree nanorings (cPNs) with N  8 form highly ordered 
arrays, on a graphite surface, with the porphyrins parallel to the 
surface. The larger nanorings (N  2440) also form stacked 
aggregates on a gold surface, if deposited in the absence of 
pyridine.16 However, STM images of these species only provide 
information in two dimensions, and lack atomic resolution. a. Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory,
