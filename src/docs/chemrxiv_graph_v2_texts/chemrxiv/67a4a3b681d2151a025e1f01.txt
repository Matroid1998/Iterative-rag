Description:
Drives the self-assembly process through hydrogen bonding.

Text:
Since the pioneering work by Gazit and coworkers, diphenylalanine (FF) and its derivatives have been 
extensively used as minimalistic peptide building blocks capable of selfassembling into larger functional 
structures. 16 The selfassembly process is primarily driven by hydrogen bonding and  interactions, 
the latter referring to the attractive interactions between electrons in the aromatic fluorenyl rings. Imaging techniques such as TEM, SEM, and AFM have revealed that FF dipeptides selfassemble into
