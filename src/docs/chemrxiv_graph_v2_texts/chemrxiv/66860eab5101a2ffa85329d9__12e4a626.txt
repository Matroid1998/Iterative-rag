Description:
Unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds that can be transformed into value-added molecules using rare-earth organometallic complexes.

Text:
Arising from the unique properties of rareearth metal 
ions, such as strong Lewis acidity, variable ionic radius, 
stable 3 oxidation state, CH activation reactions 
promoted by rareearth metals display distinct reaction 
pathways, substrate scopes as well as chem, regio or 
stereoselectivities with latetransition metal catalysis.5 
Taking use of strong heteroatomaffinity of rareearth metal 
ions and high reactivity of REC bond towards unsaturated 
carboncarbon bonds, rareearth organometallic complex 
enables to transform heteroatomcontaining substrates and 
alkene or alkynes into valueadded molecules in a highly
