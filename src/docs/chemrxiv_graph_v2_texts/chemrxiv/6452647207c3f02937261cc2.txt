Introduction 
The development of reactions and strategies enabling the chemo, regio andor stereoselective 
modification of polyfunctional compounds is an important field of research in organic 
chemistry.1 Chemo and regioselectivity issues are most often overcome by using a 
protectiondeprotection sequence for one or more of the substrates functional groups.
