Description:
Undergo biodegradation where microorganisms convert them into CO2 and microbial biomass.

The 
latter may also receive indirect inputs when fertilized with PEGcontaining sludge.5 
Despite these release pathways into natural and engineered systems, the environmental 
chemistry and fate of PEGs  as well as of WSPs in general  remains poorly studied and 
understood.6,7 Besides transport and mobility considerations,8,9 transformation processes, such 
as extracellular chainscission reactions, are of particular relevance. Biodegradation, a process 
in which microorganisms take up and metabolically convert PEGs into CO2 and microbial bi
omass, can be considered the ultimate transformation endpoint.
