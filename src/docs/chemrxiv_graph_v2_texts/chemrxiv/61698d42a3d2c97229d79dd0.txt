Description:
The most widely studied photoswitch with significant chemical and structural changes resulting from isomerization.

Text:
Photoswitches are molecules that are reversibly and chemically interconverted between two 
states with light. Azobenzene is the most widely studied photoswitch and has a welldocumented 
synthesis via diazonium coupling reactions.1 The relatively small size of azobenzene, along with 
the significant chemical and structural changes resulting from isomerization, has enabled its use 
for the spatiotemporal control of proteins, lipids, neurotransmitters, neurons, and carbohydrates.2
14 Phenyl functionalization can improve photophysical properties for applications in chemical 
biology1516 and materials science.1721 Scheme 1 shows the photochemical E  Z conversion of 
azobenzene and the subsequent Z  E thermal reversion.

Description:
Requires ultraviolet light (320 nm) to promote E-Z isomerization and has a metastable Z-isomer that thermally reverts to the E isomer with a half-life of 2 days at room temperature.

Text:
Azobenzene requires ultraviolet light 
(320 nm) to promote the E  Z isomerization, limiting its utility in vivo due to undesired light
promoted dimerizations, destruction of living tissue from UVlight, and low light penetrability in 
living tissue.11, 2223 Further, the metastable Zisomer thermally reverts to the E isomer and has a 
halflife (t12) of 2 days at room temperature in acetonitrile. This relatively short halflife results in 
an unstable photostationary state (PSS), thus limiting photoswitch efficacy where bistability is 
neded.8 As such, an ideal photoswitch features a longlived t12 (e.g., weeks to months), an Eisomer 

1 
max in the visible range, and wellseparated max values for the E and Z isomers to prevent bimodal 
isomerization. Scheme 1. The azobenzene photoswitch reaction.
