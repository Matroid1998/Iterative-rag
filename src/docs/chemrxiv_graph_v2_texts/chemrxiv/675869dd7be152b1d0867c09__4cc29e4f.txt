A potent greenhouse gas contributing significantly to global warming.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, currently responsible for more than 13 of global
53
warming since preindustrial times (IPCC, 2021), and it is atmospheric burden contin
54
ues to increase with a new record set in 2022 (Lan et al., 2024). The pathways assessed
55
by the IPCC that stay below 1.5 C of global warming by 2050 require substantial re
56
ductions of methane emissions (IPCC, 2021; Rogelj  Lamboll, 2024). The main way
57
to achieve this is to reduce methane emissions from especially agriculture, fossil fuels and
58
waste. According to HoglundIsaksson et al. (2020), the maximum potential for reduc
59
tion in emissions is limited to 3045  by 2030 and 50  by 2050.

A greenhouse gas whose biological emissions are increasing due to global temperature rise.

This leaves a large amount

of methane that cannot be mitigated unless new currently unknown mitigation technolo

gies are discovered, or if a technology is developed to remove methane from the atmo

sphere, similar to carbon dioxide removal technologies. 63
While the Global Methane Pledge signed by many countries may contribute to re
64
ducing emissions (European Commission, 2023 November 2021, Brussels), it is not suf
65
ficient to prevent 1.5 C of global warming by 2050 (Rogelj  Lamboll, 2024). In addi
66
tion, due to global temperature rise the biological emissions of methane are increasing
67
substantially (Kleinen et al., 2021; Nisbet et al., 2023), which can not be addressed through
