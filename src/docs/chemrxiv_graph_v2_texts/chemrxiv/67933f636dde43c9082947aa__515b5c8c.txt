Description:
A family of natural products that pose structural challenges due to the stereoselective construction of adjacent quaternary centres.

Text:
This stems from the sterically 
encumbered environment around these centres and the limited 
number of synthetic methodologies for the stereoselective 
construction of adjacent allcarbon quaternary centres.14 
Despite the structural challenges posed by the ginkgolide family 
of natural products, several of their members have been the 
successful target of total synthesis. In 1988, Corey reported the 
first total syntheses of ()ginkgolides A and B, which overcame 
the challenging stereoselective construction of the adjacent 
quaternary centres through an elegant 22 ketene 
cycloaddition and subsequent ring expansion (Figure 1B).15, 16
