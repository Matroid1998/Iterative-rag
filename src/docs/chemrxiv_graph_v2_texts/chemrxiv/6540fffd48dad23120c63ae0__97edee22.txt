Description:
An organic dye whose reaction pathways can be controlled using photobases with different excitation wavelengths and photoreaction timescales.

The most notable example of a reversible Arrhenius photobase is malachite green 
carbinol base (MGCB) and its watersoluble methylated derivative.2831 Brnsted photobases 
have been used to control chemical reactions in various functional systems, including catalysis 
photoactivation, lightinduced droplet selfpropulsion, photocurrent generation, dynamic self
assembly, and lightmodulated ionic transport.3235 The use of MGCB in functional systems 
involves lightdriven DNA conformational switches, photoresponsive hydrogels, dynamic self
assembly, and photoresponsive photonic crystals.3639 
In this work, we control the reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S (ARS) using 
the unique interaction between two photobases of Arrhenius and Brnsted types, having 
different excitation wavelengths and photoreaction timescales. We show that by a sophisticated 
interplay between them, we can use the advantages and compensate for the disadvantages of 
each of them.
