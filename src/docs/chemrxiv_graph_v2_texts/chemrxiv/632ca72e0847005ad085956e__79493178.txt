Description:
An argyrodite solid electrolyte that decomposes at the interface with Li-metal anode.

SSBs require mate
rials that meet several performance metrics,7 and remain lim
ited by the thermodynamic instability of electrodeelectrolyte in
terfaces.8,9 For instance, wellknown solid electrolytes such as
Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl (argyrodite), and Li7La3Zr2O12 decompose
at the interface with Limetal anode forming solidelectrolyte in
terphases that are difficult to control and cause performance
degradation.10,11 Therefore, further improvements to SSB design
require searching for new materials that are stable at suitable re
duction and oxidation potentials. A central problem in using machine learning (ML) methods to
accelerate the search for novel crystal structures is finding struc
tures that are thermodynamically stable, i.e., stable against de
composition into competing phases. Compositional models are
not sufficiently accurate to reliably predict thermodynamic sta
