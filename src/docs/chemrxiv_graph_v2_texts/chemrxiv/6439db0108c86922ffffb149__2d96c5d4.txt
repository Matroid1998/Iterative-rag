5 Traditionally, microfluidic devices made of silicon and glass have provided 
geometrical precision and reusability, but they are expensive to scale. Polymer 
substrates like thermoplastics and PDMS are moderate in cost and enable middle
tohighthroughput fabrication. However, recent trends in microfluidic pointofcare 
diagnostics have sought to use inexpensive disposable materials such as paper and 
thread to improve scalability and ease of use. 38 Paperbased analytical substrates 
have been used since the 1940s for chromatography and electrophoresis. Nitrocellulose membrane emerged as a platform for the home pregnancy test in the 
1980s and has since remained the gold standard for lateral flow assays and 
commercial diagnostics. 912 Since then, there has been a surge of interest in paper
based diagnostics research.
