Description:
A molecule with 17100 degrees of freedom when treated explicitly in simulations.

Text:
Explicit simulation6 of the solvent environment
provides a highly detailed description of solvation, however, this type of calculation is very
expensive and often requires extensive sampling to determine equilibrium properties. For
example, if 100 molecules of a solvent are treated explicitly, 900 degrees of freedom for wa
ter, 7200 degrees of freedom for 1heptanol, and 17100 degrees of freedom for 1Octadecanol
will be added respectively. Analyzing observable properties of a solute requires averaging
over these degrees of freedom, often through Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics techniques,
which are limited by computer resources and computing performance.
