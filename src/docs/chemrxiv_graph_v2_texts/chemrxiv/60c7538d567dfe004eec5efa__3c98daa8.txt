Description:
A radiolabeled nonnatural amino acid used for PET imaging of system xC.

Text:
The use of positron emission tomography (PET) for the detection and staging of cancer using
18F2fluoro2deoxyDglucose (18FFDG) demonstrates the power molecular imaging holds
for targeting metabolic abnormalities in cancer 1. The overexpression of amino acid
transporters in transformed cells is well recognized as a biomarker that can be targeted for
diagnostic purposes, for example using radiolabeled nonnatural amino acids. Such radiotracers
offer advantages over 18FFDG when imaging tumors located adjacent to healthy tissues with
naturally high glycolytic rates (e.g. the brain) or in cases where the cancer does not exhibit
aberrant glucose uptake (e.g. prostate cancer) 26. (S)4(318FFluoropropyl)LGlutamic Acid
(18FFSPG) is a radiolabeled nonnatural amino acid used for PET imaging of system xC
 715.
