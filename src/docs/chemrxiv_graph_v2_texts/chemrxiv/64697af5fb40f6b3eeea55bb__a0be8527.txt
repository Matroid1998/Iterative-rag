Description:
Commonly alloyed with GaN and InN to tailor optoelectronic properties for light-emitting diodes.

Text:
Alloying of ultrawide band gap aluminum nitride (AlN) with
other IIInitrides has unlocked attractive optoelectronic and elec
tromechanical properties that have been utilized for developing
ultraviolet lightemitting diodes,1 resonators2,3 etc. For exam
ple, AlN is commonly alloyed with isostructural GaN and InN
to tailor its optoelectronic properties for lightemitting diodes.4
More recently, AlN has been alloyed with heterostructural ScN
(rocksalt) and BN (hexagonal) to tune its piezo and ferroelectric
properties.510 AlNbased wurtzite alloys have also drawn atten
tion for direct, monolithic integration with semiconductor devices
based on tetrahedrallybonded Si and GaN. Heterostructural AlN
based alloys (Figure 1a) are particularly interesting because they
exhibit unique thermodynamics of mixing (Figure 1b), and elec
tromechanical and optical properties.
