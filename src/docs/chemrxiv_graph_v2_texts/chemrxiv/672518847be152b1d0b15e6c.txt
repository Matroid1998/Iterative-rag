Description:
A greenhouse gas responsible for approximately 50% of global warming.

Limiting global temperature rise to the 1.5C Paris target is becoming increasingly unlikely (IPCC, 2023). 40 
Global mean temperatures have risen by 1.1C relative to 18501900, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
41 
methane (CH4)  the two most abundant greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the earths atmosphere  are 
42 
responsible for approximately 50 and 30 of this warming, respectively (IPCC, 2023). Anthropogenic 
43 
CH4  mainly from agriculture, fossil fuel production, and waste decomposition (Saunois et al., 2020)  
44 
has become an attractive target to mitigate nearterm global temperature rise because of its potency and 
45 
short atmospheric lifetime relative to CO2. Ocko et al.
