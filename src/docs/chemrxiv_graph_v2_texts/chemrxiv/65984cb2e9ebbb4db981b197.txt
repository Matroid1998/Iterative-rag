Description:
Chiral chromophores that influence the aggregation of constituent units, leading to chiral supramolecular assemblies.

Text:
The chi
rality in the material may be an intrinsic property of the chromophore, like in helicenes,1218
or be imprinted by attaching a chiral substituent on an achiral chromophore.6,8,19 This
molecularscale chirality then influences the aggregation of the constituent units, leading to
a chiral supramolecular assembly. However, the supramolecular structure is also influenced
by the preparation method, which often leads to polymorphism within the same sample.6
Because of the nature of the technological applications of these materials, their char
acterization often relies on spectroscopic techniques based on the interaction with chi
ral light, i.e., circularly polarized light.
