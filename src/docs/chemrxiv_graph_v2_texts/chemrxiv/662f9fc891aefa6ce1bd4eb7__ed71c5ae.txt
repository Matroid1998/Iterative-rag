Description:
A key element in nitrogen fixation, converted into ammonia.

Text:
Nitrogen fixation is a cornerstone of modern agriculture and industrial chemistry and
revolves around the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen N2 into ammonia NH3. Plants
perform nitrogen fixation to produce nitrides for their own sustained survival through the
intricate and complex mechanisms of nitrogenases. These enzyme catalysts are based on
variations of an iron based cofactor combined with molybdenum or vanadium and we are
yet to understand these mechanisms and replicate them into grandscale ammonia synthesis
1, 2. The current industrial standard for nitrogen fixation, the HaberBosch process, while
effective, demands high energy inputs and operates under extreme conditions. In light of
this, substantial effort has been made to search for more sustainable methods.
