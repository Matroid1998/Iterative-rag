Description:
An inorganic semiconductor used in strong light-matter coupling studies.

Text:
Polariton condensates are at the forefront of emergent classical and quantum 
technologies, acting as lowthreshold lasers 6, optical logical gates7,8 and quantum bits for quantum 
information technology9. Most studies of strong lightmatter coupling have been performed in cavities containing traditional 
inorganic semiconductors such as GaAs10, CdTe11, ZnO12 and GaN13. Most of these group IIIV 
semiconductors, experience low exciton binding energies in their bulk form and hence require the 
formation of sophisticated quantum well structures and cryogenic temperatures to sustain excitons 
and undergo stronglight matter coupling 1416 . As an alternative to these materials, recent interest 
has turned to twodimensional (2D) hybrid organicinorganic metal halide phases, which form 
selfassembled quantum well structures hosting confined excitons.
