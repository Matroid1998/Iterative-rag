Description:
Stored using materials-based systems like porous adsorbents for safer and more efficient storage under milder conditions.

Text:
Hydrogen is currently stored via compression or 
liquefaction, but extreme storage conditions (350 bar for compression or 20 K for liquefication) 
incur safety concerns as well as high capital and operation costs.3 Instead, materialsbased storage 
systems, such as porous adsorbents,4 metal hydrides,5 and organic H2 carriers,6 are expected to 
enable H2 storage under milder conditions to realize safer and more efficient systems.7 The non
dissociative H2 storage mechanism associated with porous adsorbents makes them particularly 
promising for pointofuse applications, because such storage systems necessitate high cyclability 
and facile H2 chargedischarge kinetics with minimum energetic inputs.
