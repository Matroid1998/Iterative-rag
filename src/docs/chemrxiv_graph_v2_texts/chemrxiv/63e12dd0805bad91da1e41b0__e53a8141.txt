Description:
Part of a closed carbon cycle when CO2 is converted using renewable energy sources.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) has attracted a wide amount of attention 
as a potential means to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by converting CO2 into fuels and societally 
important chemicals.1,2 In particular, this technology has the potential to contribute to a closed 
carbon cycle when powered by lowcarbon renewable energy sources.3,4 Amongst key challenges 
in advancing CO2R systems towards practical use is the development of nonprecious metal 
catalysts that can selectively reduce CO2 into a single desired fuel and integrating them into a 
functional device.5,6 
Molecular catalysts have long been studied as model systems for extracting important 
structureactivity relationships in CO2R because binding site, functional ligands and reaction 
environment can all be precisely defined.7,8 This offers particular advantages over heterogeneous 
catalysts which often have a diversity of possible active sites in generating fundamental insights 
that can later be translated to functional systems.

Description:
Surfaces that facilitate adsorption of metal complexes with extended conjugated systems in GDEs.

In contrast, hydrophobicity is advantageous for catalysts applied in gas diffusion 
electrodes, which feed CO2 to the catalyst directly from the gas phase and the reaction largely 
occurs at a gasliquidsolid interphase.11 In this context, rationally incorporated hydrophobic 
elements have greatly boosted the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in GDEbased 
reactors.12,13 However, these efforts to date have only been limited to heterogeneous catalysts. Molecular CO2R catalysts have indeed been integrated with gasfed flow cells and initial results 
have demonstrated that phthalocyaninesporphyrins,1417 Co quaterpyridine18 and Ni cyclam19 
catalysts can also function in this geometry. However, most of these molecular systems have been 
metal complexes that possess an extended conjugated system that facilitates their ease of 
adsorption onto the carbon surfaces in a GDE.
