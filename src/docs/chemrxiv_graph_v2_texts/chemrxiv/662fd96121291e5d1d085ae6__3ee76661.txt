Description:
A major source of organic material for corals, translocated from photosynthetic microalgae to host cells.

Albeit overlooked for many years, ocean deoxygenation is now also recognized as a substantial 
threat to coral reefs (5,6), but how corals are able to regulate their internal O2 levels in response to 
changes in external O2 remains poorly understood (7). A key limitation is our ability to link the O2 
concentration in the surrounding water to the tissuelevel O2 concentration, which is affected by 
coral morphology and metabolism but also O2 transfer across the tissuewater and tissueskeleton 
interface. Colonies of tropical reefbuilding corals are composed of hundreds to thousands of simple, calci
fying polyp animals that harbor photosynthetic microalgae in their tissues, and the photosynthates 
translocated from the microalgal symbionts to the surrounding host cells are the major source of 
organic carbon for the animal.
