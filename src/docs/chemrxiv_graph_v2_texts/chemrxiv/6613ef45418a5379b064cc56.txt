Description:
A compound synthesized using electride catalysts.

Text:
Electrides are materials in which the electrons detach from 
the valence shell of ions and reside in the crystal structure, 
acting as anions.1,2 Because these anionic electrons are not 
bound to a nucleus, they are easier to migrate and extract 
compared to electrons in conventional materials, leading to 
relatively low work functions and high conductivities.1 These 
properties are desirable for several important technological 
applications to which it is expected that electrides can be 
successfully applied. For example electron emitters,3 light 
emitting diodes (LED) devices.4 nonlinear optical switchers,5 
superconductors,6 and catalysts,7,8 for e.g. the synthesis of 
ammonia,9 are all areas of active investigation for electrides.
