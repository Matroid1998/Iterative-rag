Description:
An inorganic material that can transition to a glass phase through heat or mechanical force-induced cleavage and rearrangement of bonds.

Text:
The transition of MOFs from crystal to 
liquid or glass phase was achieved by the heat or mechanical forceinduced cleavage and 
rearrangement of their coordination bonds, similar to the phase transition of inorganic 
materials like silica glasses.11,12 For the sake of processability, the synthesis of MOF liquids 
or glasses is beneficial for their integration with various industrial applications. From the 
perspective of porosity, however, the amorphization of MOFs with bond breakages often 
leads to the collapse of their porous networks and the uncontrollable densification of 
materials.13,14 Consequently, most of the MOFderived liquids or glasses are less porous or 
even nonporous, compared to their initial crystalline structures.15
