Description:
Catalysts used for catalytic oxidation, known for high thermal stability and variable oxidation states.

3,4 For this purpose, distinct variety of catalysts such as 
precious metals and transition metals oxides (TMOs) are largely applied for catalytic oxidation. Supported precious metals ccatalysts including Au, Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir have demonstrated excellent 
performances in CH4 oxidation reactions. 57 As an example, Pd supported catalyst in particular 
has demonstrated outstanding activity in the CH4 total oxidation at low above 400C. 810 
However, this type of catalyst presents major drawbacks such as the availability, poisoning tendency 
as well as sintering at high temperatures that leads to a loss of their performance. 11,12 In contrast, 
TMOs although slightly less active than precious metals catalysts, are available and less expensive, 
more resistant to poisoning (chlorine, sulfur, etc. ), exhibits high thermal stability, variable oxidation 
states.
