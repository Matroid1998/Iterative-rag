Description:
A polymer with a CC backbone structure that is challenging to chemically recycle due to the need for selective activation of CH or CC bonds.

Text:
Most consumed polymers, such 
as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE), however, contain CC backbone structures which 
are much more challenging to chemically recycle as selective activation of CH or CC bonds is required. Aside from achieving selective chemical transformations, several other factors of the recycling process i.e. collection, sorting, and purification pose significant challenges but are not the focus of this review.
