Description:
A greenhouse gas with significant anthropogenic emissions, particularly from the oil and gas sector.

Text:
Mitigating anthropogenic methane emissions is pivotal for achieving the goal of limiting
increase in the global average temperature to below 1.5C above preindustrial levels set
by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.1,2 Oil and gas emerges as a key sector for reducing
emissions, contributing 22 of the global anthropogenic methane emissions3,4 and 32 in
the United States.5 In June 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced 850 million in federal funding aimed at
reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.6 Methane emissions from this sector
are characterized by significant temporal fluctuations,7,8 with sporadic, shortlived events of
high emissionsknown as super emitter eventsaccounting for a substantial portion of the
total emissions.9,10 In this context, Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS), comprising mul
tiple pointinspace sensors that continuously measure methane concentrations, are becoming
increasingly vital for emission monitoring.

Description:
A gas whose emissions are detected and quantified using CMS sensor placement strategies on oil and gas sites.

Text:
They offer near realtime tracking capabilities es
sential for identifying both highly fluctuating emissions and transient super emitters.1113
CMS plays a crucial role in detecting, localizing, and quantifying site emissions.1416
CMS sensor placement, the strategy of positioning multiple fixed point sensors on an oil
and gas site, significantly affects the efficiency of methane emissions detection, especially
when considering a limited sensor budget.17 Sensor placement optimization has been exten
sively studied in environmental monitoring applications such as air pollutant monitoring,18,19
