Description:
Regenerated regioselectively in aqueous media by CpRh(bipy)Cl using high concentrations of formate as hydride source.

Text:
TH reactions in aqueous media were not reported until the mid 1980s1, and the presence of water 
seemed to increase catalytic rates, thus, allowing the use of more environmentally friendly solvents. In 1991, 
Steckhan et al. developed the first series of TH metal catalysts  with CpRh(bipy)Cl (bipy  2,2bipyridyl, 
Figure 1)  being the most active derivative  capable of regenerating regioselectively 1,4NADH in aqueous 
media (pH 7, 37 C) using high concentrations of formate as hydride source2. In 2001, Fish et al. obtained 
structureactivity relationships on CpRh(bipy)Cl and derivatives and obtained initial insights into the 
mechanisms of NADH cofactor regeneration3. In 2006, Sadler et al. proposed to exploit the TH properties of 
Ru(II)arene complexes of general formula (6 arene)Ru(X,Y)ClPF6 (X,Y  ethylendiamine, bipy, or 
acetylacetone, Figure 1) to regenerate NADH4.
