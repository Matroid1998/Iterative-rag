Description:
Removed from water using activated carbon produced from avocado seeds.

The emissions of anthropogenic CO2 have caused a big impact on the global climate 
(Zhang et al. 2019). The CO2 is mainly produced by fossil fuels combustion but also 
accompanies cement production, petrochemical, and other chemical processes (Huang et al. 2022). Activated carbons produced from waste biomass are very promising and lowcost 
materials for CO2 adsorption (Creamer et al. 2014). Some methods of activated carbons production from avocado seeds have been 
described in the literature. Avocado seeds were applied for activated carbon production for 
phenol removal from water (Rodrigues et al. 2011). The carbonization was performed in an 
oven at 800oC and then activated with CO2 at 900oC. Carbon material with a low specific
