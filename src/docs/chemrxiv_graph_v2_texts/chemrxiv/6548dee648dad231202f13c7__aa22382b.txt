Description:
Compounds with unique electronic and geometrical structures and unusual reactivity.

Text:
Exploring rareearth complexes bearing dianions of 
aromatic hydrocarbons, vinylarenes and their heterocyclic 
analogues (L2) has been going over 20 years.110 Such 
complexes remain poorly studied and still attract the 
attention of organometallic chemists by their unique 
electronic and geometrical structures, as well as by their 
unusual reactivity. The nonclassical dianions L2 are easily 
polarizable electronrich formally 4nelectronic ligands 
occupying a large volume in the Ln3 coordination sphere 
but fewer coordination sites, compared to classical 4n2 
electron aromatic ligands (Cp, its various derivatives, COT2
, etc.).
