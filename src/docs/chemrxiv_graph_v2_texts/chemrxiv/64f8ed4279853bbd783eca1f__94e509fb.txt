Description:
A compound used in the polymerization of PEG macrocrosslinkers to prepare hydrogel microcapsules.

Text:
Indeed, hydrogel microcapsules could be prepared by polymerization of 
PEG macrocrosslinkers, such as , dimethacrylateterminated PEG.9, 11 However, when dried, PEG 
hydrogels lose their elasticity and, therefore, it is difficult to dry such hydrogel microcapsules without 
damaging the capsules. Other approaches to create double emulsion microcapsules that allow for 
transport of hydrophilic compounds across their shell have been proposed. For example, capsules with 
a permeable selfhealing shell have been prepared using a dynamicallycrosslinked polymer network 
that can seal holes formed upon capsule cracking.12 In other instances, permeable capsules have been 
made through phase separation of polymers during UVinduced polymerization of the middle oil fluid,13
