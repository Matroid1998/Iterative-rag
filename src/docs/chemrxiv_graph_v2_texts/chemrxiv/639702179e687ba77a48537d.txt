Description:
A molecular photoswitch of trans cis type that shifts between isomers with light.

Text:
Azobenzene is a molecular photoswitch of trans cis type. Shifting between the isomers
with light enables various transformations and control over numerous properties of sys
tems ranging from macromolecules13 through interfaces4,5 to solids.68 In (soft) condensed
matter systems, such as azobenzenecontaining selfassembled monolayers (SAMs),9,10 mi
celles,1113, liquid crystals14 or crystals,15 azobenzene units are, in general, coupled to
each other. This coupling manifests itself in spectral changes with respect to the corre
sponding monomer case, e.g. dissolved azobenzenecontaining molecules in solution.12,16
