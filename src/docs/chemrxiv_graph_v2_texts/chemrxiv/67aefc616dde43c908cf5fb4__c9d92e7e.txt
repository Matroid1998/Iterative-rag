Description:
Has two nonequivalent sites in the crystal structure of FAp, with Ca1 being 9-fold coordinated with oxygen and Ca2 being 7-fold coordinated with six oxygen atoms and one fluorine atom.

Text:
The crystal structure of FAp has two nonequivalent calcium sites.11 The Ca1 site is 9fold 
coordinated with oxygen atoms (d(Ca1O)  2.554 ), and exhibits C3v symmetry. The smaller Ca2 site 
is 7fold coordinated with six oxygen atoms (d(Ca2O)  2.462 ) and one fluorine atom (d(Ca2F)  
2.311 , average  2.440 ), and exhibits Cs symmetry. The Ca1 polyhedra are linked to each other 
through faces and to Ca2 polyhedra through corners. In contrast, the Ca2 polyhedra are linked to each 
other through corners, not faces. In this way, the Ca1 polyhedra form rigid chains and the Ca2 polyhedra 
flexible spirals along the caxis.
