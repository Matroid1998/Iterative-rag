Description:
An element investigated for its role in strong field ionization in HCCX.

Text:
In a previous study, we investigated the angular dependence of strong field ionization in HCCX (X  
F, Cl, Br, I).27 In recent work we simulated charge migration and decoherence in HCCI with time
dependent configuration interaction (TDCI) using geometries and vibrational frequencies for the X and A 
states of HCCI cation available in the literature.1516 In the present work we have calculated the structures, 
ionization potentials and vibrational frequencies of HCCX cations in the X and A states with CCSD and 
EOMCCSDIP using a ccpVTZ basis set. The calculated data will be used in future simulations of charge 
migration and decoherence in these systems.
