Description:
A greenhouse gas.

Text:
The Coulomb matrix is a square and symmetric matrix with size equal to the number of atoms in the 
molecule, squared. It represents electronic interactions of the atoms of a molecule with themselves and 
each other. Diagonal elements represent a polynomial fit of atomic energies to nuclear charge, hence, 
they represent the fitted atomic energies of the atoms. Offdiagonal elements represent Coulomb 
repulsion between atoms. Figure 1 displays a CM representation of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. 2
