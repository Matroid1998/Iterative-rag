Despite the remarkable progress made in the coordination chem
istry and photophysics of Fecarbene complexes, consistent mech
anistic understanding of the undergoing excitedstate dynamics
is often still lacking; this profound knowledge could in fact also
be the key for reallife applications for solar cells and photocata
lysts. Inconsistencies may typically be rooted in discrepancies in
interpretations, stemming from the complexity of data acquired
by timeresolved (pumpprobe) experiments andor approxima
tions made in theoretical models for excitedstate simulations. For
FeNHCs, the scenario is best illustrated by the case of the very
first discovered FeNHC photosensitiser, Fe(bmip)22 (bmip 
2,6bis(3methylimidazole1ylidine)pyridine), shown in Figure
1, right.
