Description:
Chemically modified from soybean oil for use in resin formulation.

The same does not apply to SLA printers for which 
the final crosslinked object cannot be recycled and the main components of the resins still derive from petroleumsourced 
products. It is, therefore, necessary for SLA 3D printing to go one step further and detach as much as possible from fossil sources 
and shift to using biobased components. Recently, more and more 3D printing resin brands have started offering biobased resin alternatives for SLA to creators. Various 
plant oil sources have been used commercially (6) and in research (7, 8), with most resin alternatives being based on soybean 
oil. This latter is chemically modified to acrylates (9) that are used in the resin formulation. However, cultivating soy is associated 
with specific challenges.
