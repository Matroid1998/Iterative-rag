Description:
A class of antifungal drugs.

Text:
C. auris is causing 
considerable concerns because it generally displays resistance against at least one class 
of antifungal drugs, and in some cases resistance against all three major antifungal drug 
classes (polyenes, azoles and echinocandins).7 Indeed, the 2019 Centres for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) report on Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United 
States already lists C. auris as an Urgent Threat, with 90 of isolates resistant to at 
least one antifungal, and 30 resistant to at least two antifungals. Reported cases 
increased 318 in 2018 when compared to the average number of cases reported in 
2015 to 2017.8 
Despite their growing threat to global health, the current development pipeline for 
antifungal agents is even sparser than the already meager antibacterial drug landscape,
