A greenhouse gas contributing to climate change and environmental pollution.

The climate crisis and the pollution of the environment are some of the greatest threats to the 
livelihoods of current and future generations.1,2 Increase of water shortages, even droughts, and 
subsequent famines, as well as other weather extremes and biodiversity loss, must be fought by 
drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, achieving climate neutrality, and limiting global 
warming to 1.5 C.3 Even though scientific research drives innovation and helps to understand both 
climate change and planetary boundaries, research itself is very resourceintensive. If science were a 
country, it would be number 40 in CO2 emissions.4 Lab spaces consume five to ten times more 
energy and three to five times more water5 than office buildings.

t of plastic waste annually, which is almost 2  of the worlds 
total plastic waste.10 Over their life cycle, plastics contribute 3.5  to the total global CO2 
emissions.11 
Fortunately, funding agencies such as the German Research Foundation (DFG), the Science 
Foundation Ireland (SFI), the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Marie SkodowskaCurie Actions, 
the Wellcome Trust, and Cancer Research UK1217 have started to demand that the implementation 
of sustainable lab practices has to be addressed in research proposals and that these measures are 
then implemented in the projects funded by them.
