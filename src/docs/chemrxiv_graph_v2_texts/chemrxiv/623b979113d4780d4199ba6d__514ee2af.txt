Description:
Synthesized via palladium-catalyzed tandem C-C activation-cyclization.

3Bromo4hydroxy5methoxy ringsubstituted isopropyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) was 
reported in biochemical evaluation of virtual screening methods that revealed a cellactive 
inhibitor of the cancerpromoting phosphatases of regenerating liver 1. 2,3,5Trichloro 
ringsubstituted PCA was involved in preparation of isoxazoline derivatives as antiparasitic 
agents for use in animals 2. 1Ethenyl3,4,5trifluorobenzene was involved in preparation 
of isoxazoline derivatives as antiparasitic agents for use in animals 3; in Palladium
catalyzed tandem CC activationcyclization induced by carbopalladation of functionalized 
nitriles synthesis of benzo dipyrromethenes 4; in synthesis of cyclic hydroxyamidines 
leading to oxadiazolines and oxadiazines as potent and highly efficacious secretase 
modulators in vivo 5.
