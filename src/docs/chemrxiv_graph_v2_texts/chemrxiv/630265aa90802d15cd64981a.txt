of PBAT to the 
blends did not affect their melting temperatures. PBSbased blends were miscible at the 
molecular level based on single Tg value calculated from Fox equation and uniform 
fracture surface morphology from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Importantly, the 
oxygen permeability of PBSDLSPBAT blend was comparable to nonbiodegradable 
highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) Tyvek used for medical devices packaging. Key words polyester blends, biodegradable polymers, polybutylene succinate, oxygen

1. Introduction 
Serious economic and environmental problems are the result of ineffective waste 
management and the use of petroleumbased plastics such as polyolefins (polyethylene, 
polypropylene). Economic growth in the 21st century has contributed to an increase in 
plastic consumption and thus pollution 1. In addition, the SARSCoV2 virus pandemic
