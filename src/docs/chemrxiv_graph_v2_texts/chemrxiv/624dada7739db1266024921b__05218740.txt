Description:
Used for myocardial imaging due to its radioactive properties and similarity in size to K(I).

Thallium is most commonly known for its detrimental properties such as its former use in rat 
poison or as a popular means to murder in both fiction and nonfiction.1 However in academic 
and medical settings, thallium, and in particular its radioactive isotopes have been recognised 
for their potential utility in healthcare. In 1975 Lebowitz et al. discussed the possible application 
of thallium201 for myocardial imaging due to the similarities in size between Tl(I) and K(I).2 
Thallium201 (201Tl) has a halflife of 73 hours and emits photons at 72 keV (Xray, 94 
abundance), 135 keV (3 abundance) and 167 keV (10 abundance) making it suitable for 
application in single photo emission computed tomography (SPECT).
