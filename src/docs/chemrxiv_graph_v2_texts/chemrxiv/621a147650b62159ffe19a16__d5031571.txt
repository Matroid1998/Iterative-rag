Description:
Subject to oxidative cleavage in a flow process.

Text:
As we experienced 
scaleup problems on a scale larger than 10 mg, we con
templated the application of flowchemistry.26 Re
cently, we developed a modular, and argondriven flow 
platform especially designed for the robustification of 
latestage transformations in natural product synthe
sis.27 In particular, gas reactions and photoreactions can 
be significantly accelerated and upscaled in flow.28 
Therefore, we translated the oxidative cleavage of 
methoxyallene 15 to ester 16 into a flow process. After 
optimizing reaction parameters, the desired ester 16 
was obtained in a slightly higher yield of 64 and a re
markably shorter reaction time of 60 minutes com
pared with 26 hours in batch (Scheme 4).
