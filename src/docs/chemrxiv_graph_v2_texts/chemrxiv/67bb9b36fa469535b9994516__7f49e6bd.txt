Description:
An epitranscriptomic modification of cytidine found in RNAs.

Text:
Acetylation of the nucleoside cytidine, which gives the N4acetylcytidine (ac4C, Figure 1) 
epitranscriptomic modification, has been observed in RNAs including tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs and various 
regulatory RNAs. It plays a wide range of roles in biological systems. Errors related to the modification 
have been found to be associated with many human diseases 1, 2. More recently, acetylation of 
deoxycytidine, which gives the N4acetyldeoxycytidine (4acC, Figure 1) epigenetic modification, has also 
been discovered in the DNA of Arabidopsis, rice, maize, mouse, and human. It is mainly located around 
transcription start sites and positively correlates with gene expression levels 3. Several studies using 
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) have shown that acetylation of 
cytosine can increase the UV melting temperature of duplex oligonucleotides (ONs) by 1  8 C 46.

Description:
Plays roles such as enhancing protein synthesis efficiency in biological systems.

Text:
The 
knowledge sheds a light on the mechanisms by which ac4C plays roles such as enhancing protein synthesis 
efficiency in the biological system 7. This shows the significance of the synthesis of ONs containing 
sensitive modifications such as ac4C and 4acC as well as numerous others 8. However, standard ON 
synthesis methods requires deprotection and cleavage under strongly basic and nucleophilic conditions, 
under which ac4C, 4acC and other sensitive groups are unstable. Although several reported methods may 
be used for the purpose, they have various limitations as discussed earlier 912. For example, some 
methods can only synthesize ONs that contain thymidine or uridine only and thus do not need nucleobase 
protection 4, 6. Some require UV irradiation for cleavage, which can damage ON 5.
