Description:
Involved in glycan binding in carbohydrate recognition domains of C-type lectin receptors.

Text:
Multivalency is commonly used by Nature to achieve high avidities of larger carbohydrates towards their 
oligomeric lectin receptors. We study this phenomenon in Ctype lectin receptors (CLRs) in which glycan 
binding occurs via Ca2 in the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs).
