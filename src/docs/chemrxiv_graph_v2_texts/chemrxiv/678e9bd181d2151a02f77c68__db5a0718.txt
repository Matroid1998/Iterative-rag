Description:
Reducing redox mediators used in cathodic reductions.

Text:
Despite significant progress in the field of electrosynthesis, advances in anodic oxidations 
far outpace advances in cathodic reductions.13 In part, this disparity can be attributed to the wide 
array of oxidizing redox mediators (i.e., cyclopropeniums,4 Noxyl radicals,5 triarylamines,6 
halogenide salts,7 and metal salts8) that are available compared to reducing redox mediators, which 
are generally limited to Nisalen,9 Cosalen,10 fullerenes,11 and aromatic hydrocarbons.12 Anodic 
oxidations are also conveniently paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as the 
supporting half reaction, while cathodic reductions typically make use of a sacrificial anode, a 
component that is susceptible to passivation or results in the introduction of unwanted chemical 
species.3, 13, 14 In addition, cathodic reductions often require electrode potentials far beyond the 
formal potential for proton and water reduction, requiring dry organic solvents and maintaining a 
moisturefree environment.3, 15 This report offers a simple electroorganic synthesis strategy to 
address all of these concerns.
