Text:
Thiol groups, are functional groups found in many proteins, that play key roles in various 
physiological processes13 and are closely related to a multitude of diseases.45 Amongst these protein thiols, some 
protein thiols are sufficiently proximal to form a disulfide bond under an oxidative environment, and exhibit bond 
cleavage in a reductive environment.6 These spatially adjacent thiol groups are called vicinal dithiols. And vicinal 
dithiolcontaining proteins (VDPs) are thiolcontaining proteins that possess at least one pair of vicinal thiols.
