Description:
A solution used in experiments involving Pt wire electrodes.

The authors de
noted the observed plasma as microarc dis
charges.30,31 A longer Pt wire electrode (10 mm
long, 0.5 mm diameter, and protected tip) was
investigated in NaOH solutions by Saito et al.,
using highspeed camera imaging, revealing in
dividual sparks for low voltages and continu
ous plasma for higher voltages.32 For a wire
without tip protection, a different type of dis
charge was observed at the unprotected side.
