Description:
Used in dynamic nuclear polarization at liquid helium temperatures.

This wellknown phenomenon, improperly termed radiation damping (RD), has been studied
decades ago9, 37 and has motivated a wealth of methodological work aiming at its suppression
or control in solution NMR.29, 13, 7 Such a magnetization behavior can also be generated in the
solid state, when the spins are brought to a high level of polarization, as has been demonstrated
using dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at liquid helium temperatures. Even less common is
the observation of multiple, selfsustained, maser pulses in the solid state. A few such examples
have been observed in the context of DNP at Helium11, 40 or liquid Nitrogen23 temperatures.
