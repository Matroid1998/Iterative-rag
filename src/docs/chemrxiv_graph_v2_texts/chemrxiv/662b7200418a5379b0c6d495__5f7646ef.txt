Characterized by ultrahigh hardness.

In recent years, significant efforts in the search for novel phases with advanced properties have 
benefited from structure prediction programs such as USPEX 1 and CALYPSO 2, and more 
recently from the crystallographic machine learning platform CrystalMELA 3. The topic of 
carbon research, especially regarding periodic structures, shows a sustained interest in the search 
for new allotropes, especially those characterized by ultrahigh hardness close to that of diamond. In view of the large number of carbon structures claimed as novel, a database SACADA 4 has 
been created to group all known carbon allotropes, thus helping researchers in their endeavors on 
the one hand, and avoiding claims of known phases as novel allotropes on the other.

Description:
An insulating material with potential for metallic-like behavior in electronics.

However, such pentacarbon should be unstable because it has 
some negative elastic constants. Later, in 2020, cubic pentadiamond was reported as a novel 
allotrope with mechanical properties close to diamond, but the paper was retracted due to serious 
errors in the optimized structure of pentadiamond under mechanical deformation admitted by 
the authors themselves 9. Such interest in 5 allotropes with mixed carbon hybridization arises 
from the possible change of the electronic structure of insulating diamond, leading to metallic
like behavior with potential applications in electronics 10. In the present work, starting from tetC4 5, we construct novel tetragonal carbon allotrope C5 
by crystal chemistry modifications followed by full geometry relaxations using calculations 
based on the quantum mechanics density functional theory DFT 11,12.
