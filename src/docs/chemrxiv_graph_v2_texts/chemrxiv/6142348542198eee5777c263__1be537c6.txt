Description:
Targeted for efficient catalysis to NH3 under mild conditions.

Text:
For industrial ammonia synthesis, it is 
widely recognized that Rubased catalysts work better than Febased 
catalysts under milder reaction conditions 11,12. However, the high 
activation energy for direct N2 dissociation and the severe poisoning 
effect of hydrogen on conventional Ru metal catalyst renders 
efficient NH3 synthesis under lower temperatures ( 623 K) and lower 
pressures ( 50 bar) unattainable13. Therefore, many attempts to 
develop new catalysts for efficiently catalyzing N2H2 to NH3 under 
mild conditions1417. Recently discovered, a new class of ammonia 
catalysts  the ternary ruthenium complex hydrides18 is a 
breakthrough in this endeavor.
