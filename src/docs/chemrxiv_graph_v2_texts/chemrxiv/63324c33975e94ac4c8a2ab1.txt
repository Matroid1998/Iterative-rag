Description:
An HIV drug affected by polymorphism, where a low solubility polymorph led to a drug recall.

Crystal packing plays an important but dicultto
predict role in controlling physical properties of organic
molecular crystals, including solubility, shelf stability,
and bioavailability.13 Polymorphism,14 or the poten
tial to form multiple distinct crystal packing motifs, is
critically important to the pharmaceutical industry,3,5
as highlighted by the case of the HIV drug ritonavir,
where the appearance of a previouslyunknown and low
solubility polymorph made it impossible to produce the
original polymorph and forced a drug recall.6 Other phar
maceutical examples of such disappearing polymorphs
are known,79 and more recently it has been suggested
that the thermodynamically stable crystal form has not
been found experimentally for 1545 smallmolecule
drugs currently available on the market.10
Over the past decade, ab initio crystal structure
prediction has moved from the category of impos
sible,

it
was

years
ago,11,12 to merely extremely challenging.1323 Suc
cessful crystal structure prediction, including quantita
tive ranking of lowenergy polymorphs, is most feasible
for smallmolecule species with limited conformational
exibility.2426 Quantitative prediction of thermodynam
ically stable polymorphs comes with stringent accuracy
requirements, as an estimated 50 of polymorph pairs
dier by less than 2 kJmol and around 95 of the con
formers dier by less than 8 kJmol.4,27,28
