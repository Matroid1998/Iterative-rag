Description:
A noble metal used as a catalyst in reactions like Sonogashira coupling, Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, Heck reaction, and Stille coupling, providing good yields under various conditions.

In 1987, the United Nations (UN) released the report, Our Common Future, which defined the 
concept of sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.1 Sustainability 
consists of three aspects economy, society, and environment.2 In turn, sustainable chemistry 
can be evaluated by three metrics renewable percentage, optimum efficiency, and waste 
percentage.3 Catalysts are one of the tools that accommodate these parameters to achieve 
sustainability. Noble metals such as platinum, palladium, iridium, and ruthenium feature desired catalytic 
properties, such as high temperature tolerance and good catalytic activity. For instance, 
Sonogashira coupling,4, 5 SuzukiMiyaura coupling,6, 7 Heck reaction,8, 9 and Stille coupling10, 11 
need palladium as catalysts that result in good yields under various conditions.
