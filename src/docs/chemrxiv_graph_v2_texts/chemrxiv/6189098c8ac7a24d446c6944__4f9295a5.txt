Description:
Recovered and reused economically from spent nuclear fuel.

Text:
The production of electricity from nuclear energy has been developed in several countries. Some countries including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom chose to
reprocess the spent nuclear fuel for an economic reuse of uranium and plutonium and a
reduction of the radioactivity and volume of the wastes.1 The recovery of uranium and
plutonium and the eective separation from ssion products and minor actinides has been
achieved at both laboratory and industrial scales by solvent extraction techniques using an
aqueous phase and an immiscible organic phase.
