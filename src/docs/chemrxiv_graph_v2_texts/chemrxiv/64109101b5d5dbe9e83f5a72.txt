Indeed, some of the highest performance thermoelectric
materials utilize toxic elements, such as PbTe, making them
unfit for many uses. New highefficiency and lowcost thermo
electric materials will need to be discovered to enable broader
device applications. Unfortunately, discovering new highefficiency materials
has proven challenging. Device efficiency scales with zT,
which can be calculated using the relation
zT  S2
 T
(1)
where S is the Seebeck coefficient,  is electrical conductivity,
 is thermal conductivity, and T is temperature. From this we
can see that the ideal thermoelectric is electrically conductive
but thermally resistive. The challenge is that these properties
are interrelated, making the maximization of zT nontrivial.
