for high activities1923 and are thus favored as catalytically active sites 
in the most recent ex situ characterization and in situ Xray absorp
tion spectroscopy (XAS) studies.2, 22, 2428 Although this group of 
catalysts has been known since the 1970s,29 the understanding of 
the active site in terms of the iron coordination environment, the 
nature of the carbon matrix, and coordination of intermediates to 
the active site(s) remains incomplete.

Description:
Exhibits characteristic spectral variations in 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy due to its coordination environment and oxidation and spin states.

Text:
57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy is a powerful technique for catalyst 
characterization since the coordination environment and the oxida
tion and spin states of iron ions lead to characteristic spectral varia
tions.30 In room temperature (RT) spectra, FeNC catalysts feature 
dominant or exclusive doublet signatures that are typically associat
ed with iron nitrogen sites (FeNx).19, 23, 27, 3132 When low tempera
