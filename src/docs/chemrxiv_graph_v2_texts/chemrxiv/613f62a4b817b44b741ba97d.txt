Description:
Crystallises in a face-centred cubic structure as part of an ideal garnet.

These materials, however, form a poorly conductive tetragonal phase at high Li 
content (as outlined below) and suffer from atmospheric HLi exchange (which ultimately forms 
insulating Li2CO3 passivating layers due to instability of the Li dopant in high concentrations)4144. This 
is in addition to the common SSE problems of high interfacial resistance and timeconsuming 
synthesis. An ideal garnet has the formula; A3B2X3O12, where A, B and X are eight, six and four coordinated cation 
sites, respectively, which crystallise in a facecentred cubic structure (e.g. A  Mg, Fe, B  Al, Cr, Fe, and
