Description:
Cheaper and more abundant, but its layered structural analogues are not stable over many intercalation cycles.

This is in contrast to
for examplemanganese and iron which are cheaper and
more abundant, but their layered structural analogues
are not stable over many intercalation cycles 1315. Embracing cation disorder enables the use of novel
cathode chemistries that do not need to maintain a lay
ered ordering on cycling 7, 1623. The performance
of any intercalation cathode is limited by the ability of
lithium to reversibly intercalate into the host frame
work which is dependent on atomistic diffusion pro
cesses. Figure 1 illustrates a cubic closepacked oxy
gen lattice. In both the layered and disordered sys
tems lithium diffusion occurs from an octahedral hole
in the O2framework via an octahedral face, into an in
terstitial tetrahedron.
