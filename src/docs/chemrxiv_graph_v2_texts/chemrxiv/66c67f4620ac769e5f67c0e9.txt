Description:
A reaction used for its specificity, selectivity, and fast kinetics in bioconjugation and polymer synthesis.

Text:
Thiolmaleimide conjugation is a highly popular reaction due to its specificity, selectivity and 
fast kinetics.1 In recent decades, this reaction has been used in various fields, including 
biomolecule labelling2 and synthesis of novel polymeric materials.3 One of the most important 
applications of the thiolmaleimide reaction is the bioconjugation between linkerpayload and 
antibody backbone, to generate antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs).4, 5 Comparing to well
developed small molecule drugs, ADC shows promise as a new class of therapeutics, with the 
first ADC approved in 2001. As of October 2023, there are 15 different ADCs approved, and 10 
of them utilize thiolmaleimide reaction during their syntheses.6 
There are mainly two competitive biotransformation processes occurring at the thiosuccinimide 
site from linker.
