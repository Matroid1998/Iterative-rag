Description:
Forms an interconnected network of hydrogen bonds leading to supramolecular aggregates.

Text:
Hydrogen bonds (HBs) have received a lot of attention from experimental and theoretical researchers due to their 
importance in many chemical and biological processes. It plays a key role to understand the structure and 
properties of many organic compounds, as well as the supramolecular assemblies and biomolecular reactivity.18 
The interconnected network of HBs formed by the molecules such as water, ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, 
alcohols, etc. leads to the formation of supramolecular aggregatesclusters.913 Despite a large number of 
investigations conducted on this topic, the nature of the HBs and their energetics estimations are the very active 
subjects of research. There are many studies reported on water clusters.1325 Although, in comparison of the water 
clusters relatively less studies reported on the hydrogen sulphide (H2S)n and mixed (H2O)m(H2S)n clusters.
