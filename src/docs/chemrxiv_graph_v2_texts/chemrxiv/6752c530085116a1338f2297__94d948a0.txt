Description:
Used primarily in the degreasing of metal parts and as an intermediate in the production of hydrofluorocarbons.

Text:
In contrast, trichloroethene is rather widely used, primarily in the 
degreasing of metal parts and as intermediate in the production of hydrofluorocarbons and 
other chemicals, with additional applications including industrial dry cleaning and the 
production of inks and paints. Finally, tetrachloroethene is applied in similar fields, notably in 
dry cleaning, as degreasing agent, and as feedstock in industrial syntheses. IUPAC names, 
frequently used synonyms and abbreviations as well as selected thermophysical properties of 
CEs are compiled in Table 1.
