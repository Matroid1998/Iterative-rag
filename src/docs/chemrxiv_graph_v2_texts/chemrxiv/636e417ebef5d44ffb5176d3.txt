Analyzing the reactivity of transitional metal nitrides, researchers concluded 13 that nitrides can be produced 
21

by the direct action of Nitrogen (N) on the metal when the small N atoms, which satisfy the empirical Hagg rule of 
22

0.59 ratio between nonmetalmetal atom radii 3, will occupy the octahedral spaces in the bodycentered cubic 
23

(BCC) Chromium (Cr) lattice and that the formed interstitial compound is influenced by the electrons in the metals 
24

outer shell 1,2. As such, having five electrons in the threedimensional shell, Cr will form two nitrides Chromium 
25

nitride (CrN) and Dichromium nitride (Cr2N). The resulting alloy inherits most of the base metal properties.
