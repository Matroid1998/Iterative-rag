Description:
Complexes of actinides with significant spin density on the Cptt ligands.

Text:
More recently, some of us reported pulsed EPR 
studies of two An complexes, An(Cptt)3 (1An; An  
Th, U; Cptt  C5H3tBu21,3), again showing significant 
spin density on the Cptt ligands for both the U3 and 
Th3 analogues.16 
 Here we report pulsed EPR studies on a family of 
early Ln3 complexes Ln(Cptt)3 (1Ln, Ln  La, Ce, 
Nd, Sm). This allows (i) investigation of any trends 
across the series, from the parent diamagnetic, f0 
complex through the paramagnetic f1,3,5 analogues.
