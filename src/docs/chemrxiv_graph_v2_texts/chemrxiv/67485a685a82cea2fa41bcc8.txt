Description:
Known to form carbides and have an affinity for carbon.

However, the eCVD of iron, cobalt, and nickel films were heavily contaminated by 
carbon,5 most likely emanating from the cyclopentadienyl (C5H5, Cp) ligands. While these 
metals are known to form carbides and have an affinity for carbon,6 preventing carbon 
containing species from the metallocene decomposition to interact with the film surface is likely 
the key to reduce the carbon contamination when using metallocenes as the precursor. We 
envision that the carbon contamination originates from incomplete FeCp2 decomposition on the 
film surface, redeposition of byproducts andor from plasma volume decomposition.
