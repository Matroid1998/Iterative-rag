Description:
A molecular system used to study dipole self energy in quantum electrodynamics.

Text:
While scQED utilizes the exact form of the
dipole self energy operator in a given orbital basis, the
projected dipole self energy that arises in pQED is inex
act except for in a complete orbital and manyelectron
basis. We present numerical results highlighting this dis
parity and its resolution in a particularly simple molecu
lar system of helium hydride cation, where it is possible
to approach these two complete basis limits simultane
ously. In this same helium hydride system, we examine
and compare the practical issue of computational cost re
quired to converge each approach towards the complete
