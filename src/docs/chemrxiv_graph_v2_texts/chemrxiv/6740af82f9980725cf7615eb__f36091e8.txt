Description:
Referenced as Ni(100) in the context of surface reactions.

Text:
This 
reaction has been shown on Ni(100)14, GaAs(100)15 and Si(100)16. For ALD of GaN, TEG 
adsorption and subsequent reactions are dependent on the surface termination after the NH3 
pulse. We have previously investigated equilibrium surface terminations after the NH3 pulse 
on GaN(0001) and shown that NH2 was the main surface structure up to about 600K.17 
In a previous study on ALD of GaN using TEG and NH3 with and without plasma activation 
of ammonia,18 we explored how the surface chemistry can enhance the elimination of the ethyl 
ligands by introducing a reactive B pulse of H2, Ar plasma, or H2Ar plasma, between the TEG
