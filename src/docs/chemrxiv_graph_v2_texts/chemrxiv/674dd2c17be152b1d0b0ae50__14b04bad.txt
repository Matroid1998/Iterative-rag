Description:
Used as monoamino derivatives in the synthesis of CD(CMG)4DOPE constructs.

Text:
Coreshell micelles were formed by selfassembly of 
conjugates consisting of DOPE lipids, carboxymethylglycine(CMG)4 spacer and  or CDs (Figure 1). CD(CMG)4DOPE constructs 
were synthesized (Scheme 1) from monoamino derivatives of alpha and betacyclodextrins and H(MCMG)4OH amino acid, which 
after hydrolysis of methyl ester groups forms a hydrophilic spacer (CMG)4.
