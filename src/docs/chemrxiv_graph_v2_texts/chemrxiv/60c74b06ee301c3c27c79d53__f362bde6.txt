Description:
Compounds with high hydrogen abstraction ability, making them effective crosslinking agents for organic polymers.

Text:
It was shown that the crosslinking was dependent on the reaction temperature, peroxide 
concentration, and crosslinking time18, 23. The effect of type and amount of peroxide and its 
decomposition rate on the crosslinking of several hydrophobic polymers was also investigated. Commercially available peroxides show relatively high hydrogen abstraction ability, which makes 
them good crosslinking agents for many organic polymers. Nevertheless, there are also a number of 
disadvantages. The decomposition products of peroxides can be volatile, exhibit a distinct smell and 
can lead to blooming effects. They may be extracted from the crosslinked compound by solvent, but 
this is clearly not a preferred approach 22. Finally, the safety demands during the handling and 
storage of peroxides are considerable.

Description:
Undergoes thermal decomposition to form primary radicals.

In this, their ability to react simultaneously or 
sequentially by radical and condensation polymerization mechanism is of particular interest 24, 25. The common crosslinking mechanism of polymers with peroxide has three main steps 1) the 
primary radical formation from the thermal decomposition of peroxide; 2) hydrogen abstraction 
from the polymer by free radicals generated in step 1; and 3) the bimolecular radical recombination 
of polymer radicals from step 2 to generate covalent crosslinks 26. Here, we report on the thermal crosslinking of a hydrophilic polymer in its melt and the 
swelling properties of the obtained hydrophilic covalent networks. A commercially available high
