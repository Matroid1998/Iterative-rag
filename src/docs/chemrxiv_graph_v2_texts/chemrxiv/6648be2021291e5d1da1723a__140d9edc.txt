Description:
Has a lower theoretical volumetric capacity compared to Mg and is surpassed by Mg in terms of dendrite formation during battery cycling.

Among the emerging 
alternatives, the Mgion battery has received significant attention due to the abundance of Mg, the 
high theoretical volumetric capacity of Mg compared to Li (3833 vs. 2046 mAhcm3), low cost, 
and environmental friendliness7,8. In addition, Mg metal demonstrates reduced dendrite formation 
during battery cycling, surpassing that of both Li and Zn, due to its low diffusion barrier and unique 
planar hexagonal growth during electrochemical deposition8. Hence, Mgion batteries hold the 
promise as a viable and sustainable energy storage technology, capable of meeting the escalating 
energy demands while mitigating environmental impacts. Recent advancements in Mgion batteries have been primarily centered on solidstate 
rechargeable batteries7,9.
