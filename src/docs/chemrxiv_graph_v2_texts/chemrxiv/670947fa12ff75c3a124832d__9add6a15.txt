Description:
A disordered phase resulting from the oxidation of Ni(OH)2 and Ni2(OH)2.

Nibased electrodes are a group of promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) 
catalysts in alkaline media, owing both to the high catalytic activity and lower 
productions costs15. Although the research on Nibearing electrodes spans five 
decades, the exact OER mechanism remains debatable in the literature. The 
generally accepted picture is that upon immersion of the Ni electrode in an alkaline 
medium, a layer of a disordered Ni2(OH)2 is spontaneously forming on its 
surface. Aging of the electrode in an alkaline solution will result in the gradual 
phase change of Ni(OH)2 to the more ordered Ni2(OH)2 variant6. Increasing 
the potential will result in the oxidation of the Ni(OH)2 surface species towards 
the (also disordered) Ni3OOH phase; oxidation of the Ni2(OH)2 leads to the 
appearance of the more ordered Ni3OOH modification.
