Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a longrange 
dipoledipole interaction that occurs between one or more excited 
fluorophore (donor) and a proximal ground state fluorophore 
(acceptor).14 In the distancedependent photophysical process, 
energy is transferred between donor and acceptor in a non
radiative pathway, resulting in fluorescence quenching of the 
donor and fluorescence enhancement of the acceptor.5,6 In 
general, various fluorescent materials constructed based on 
FRET mechanism should have the following prerequisites 1) an 
adjacent distance between donor and acceptor (110 nm); 2) an 
efficient overlap between the donor emission and acceptor 
absorption; 3) a favorable mutual orientation between donor 
emission moment, acceptor absorption moment and their 
separation vector.7 Based on the FRET strategy, many types of 
materials including organic molecules, polymers, metalorganic 
frameworks (MOFs), metal nanoparticles (NPs), transition metal 
complexes, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and carbon dots (CDs) 
have been rationally designed over the past decade,813 which 
are widely utilized for photocatalysis, anticounterfeiting, 
encryption, bioimaging, and fluorescence sensing.1418 In various 
applications, it has been an interesting and promising research 
field to construct artificial lightharvesting systems (LHSs) based 
on FRET,19,20 which not only helps people to gain deeper insights 
into the photosynthesis process in nature, but also plays a guiding 
role to mimic the natural lightharvesting systems.
