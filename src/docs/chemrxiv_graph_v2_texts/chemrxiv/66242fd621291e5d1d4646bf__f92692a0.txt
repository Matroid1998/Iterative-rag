Description:
Used by Sato and coworkers for the stepwise coupling of two different alkynes and a nitrile.

Text:
Intermolecular transition metalcatalyzed cycloadditions between ni
triles and alkynes also represent a straightforward but less explored 
atomeconomical approach for synthesizing multisubstituted pyri
dines (Figure 1B).23 However, following this strategy, only the cou
pling of two identical alkynes is possible. To the best of our 
knowledge, the intermolecular coupling between two different al
kynes and a nitrile was only accomplished in a stepwise fashion using 
stoichiometric amounts of Cp2ZrEt2 and NiCl2(PPh3)2 by Takahasi 
and coworkers24a or using titanium alkoxide by Sato and cowork
ers.24b 
Thus, a catalytic strategy to realize a threecomponent crossannula
tion of two different alkynes with nitriles would consist of a valuable 
expansion of the current state of the art, allowing the synthesis of di
verse pyridine scaffolds.
