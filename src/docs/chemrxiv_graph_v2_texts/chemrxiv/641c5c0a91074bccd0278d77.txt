Description:
Exhibits helical molecular orbitals when its symmetry is reduced from D2d to D2.

Text:
Helical topology in the frontier orbitals has been sug
gested as an avenue for designing optically active molecules.36
This orbital effect has been coined electrohelicity.7 However, its
experimental relevance is limited by the simultaneous presence
of both helicities in the electronic structure.8 Nonetheless, rela
tions to singlemolecule conductance,9,10 reaction selectivity,11
and optical properties1215 have recently been suggested. Is the
electrohelicity effect a fundamental cause for a strong chiroptical
response? Electrohelicity appears as helical molecular orbitals (MOs) in
allene and spiropentadiene when their symmetry is reduced from
D2d to D2 (or C2).7,1519 In allene both the degenerate sets
of highest occupied MOs (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied
MOs (LUMOs) are helical (Figure 1 left).
