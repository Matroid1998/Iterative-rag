Description:
Forms the excited-state enol upon absorbance of light.

In particular, a photoreaction known as 
excitedstate intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) has attracted considerable attention because 
the ESIPT process affords the potential for two different wavelengths of light from the same 
molecule depending on local environmental conditions (Fig. 1).58 We sought to design a protein 
binding pocket that could predictably and selectively distinguish between different excitedstate 
pathways of the ESIPT process. The result of this work is a fluorescent probe and that exhibits a 
change fluorescence signal by detecting subtle changes in a proteinprotein interface. Consider the emission of 2(2hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (1, Fig. 1). Upon absorbance of 
light, 1 forms the excitedstate enol 1E.
