Description:
Forms vacancy centers in diamond that are used in quantum computing due to their optical addressability and spin coherence.

Color centers are single photon emitting unpaired electrons localized in crystal lattice defects induced by 
impurities, substitutions and vacancies in a material. Interest in the application of color centers in fields such as 
quantum computing, communication and sensing is due to optical spin coupling that can be isolated and 
measured in these defects via techniques such as optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR) that operates 
by examining spin dependency in optically excited states. Recent research has focused on finding color centers 
in wide band gap semiconductors due to reduced phononlattice interactions as well as defined excitation levels 
inducing room temperature spin coherence with optical addressability in materials such as diamond nitrogen
vacancy and silicon carbide divacancy centers1,2,3.
