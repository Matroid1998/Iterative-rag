Description:
Reactants that, when combined with fatty acids, lead to the formation of phospholipids.

Text:
Only a few routes have been described for the prebiotic syn
thesis of phospholipids.15 For instance, activation of mixtures of 
fatty acids and glycerol phosphates gives rise to selfassembling 
(lyso)phosphatidic acids, the simplest of phospholipids.3,6,1618 
However, pathways leading to more complex phospholipids 
(e.g., phosphatidylcholines) remain scarce.
