Description:
A 2D material with a flexoelectric coefficient of 10 pC m1.

Text:
However, the 
flexoelectric coefficients of available 2D materials are modest, with the highest reported value 
being 10 pC m1 for MoS2 monolayers.10, 11 In contrast to 2D materials, flexoelectric coefficients 
as high as 1111  17.33 C m1 have been observed in bulk ceramics such as barium titanate12 
that have limited flexibility. Hence, the performance of flexoelectric generators have been low. In this Article, we present a flexible nanogenerator (FNG) that incorporates enhanced 
flexoelectricity in few atomic layersthick membranes of an inexpensive mineral, Hausmannite 
(Mn3O4), to produce up to 7.99 mW m2 power density (active surface area 2.5 cm2). We
