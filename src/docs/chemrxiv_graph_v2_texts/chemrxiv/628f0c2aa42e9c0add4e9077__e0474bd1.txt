Used for neutralization and gypsum precipitation in pretreatment processes.

20,21 suggested that membrane filtration processes are the only treatment methods 
that are able to meet regulatory requirements, despite their complex multistage structure, operational 
problems (due to scaling), and high costs. In examining pretreatment methods, they concluded that the 
optimal pretreatment step involves the use of Ca(OH)2 for neutralization and gypsum precipitation; in 
testing with additional nanofiltration and RO filtration steps in a pilot facility, the process achieved a 
limited quantity of permeate with increased treatment cost. Similarly, AlHarahsheh et al.4,22 applied 
selective neutralizationprecipitation pretreatement involving the addition of Ca(OH)2 (as also 
reported by Gouider et al.23). Nevertheless, there remains a lack of highly circular processes that 
maximize resource recovery while minimizing environmental risk. Innovative integration and
