Description:
Hybrid organic-inorganic compounds of the form AB2X3, with only a subset considered stable for further calculations.

Common constraints on materials do
mains include synthesizability, unwanted phase behavior, instabil
ity, and toxicity. For example, when surveying a polymer library for
enzymestabilizing candidates, Tamasi et al. encountered phase
separating or aggregating polymers unsuitable for physical assays
with the target enzyme9. Likewise, Krbel et al. surveyed 1,276
hybrid organicinorganic halide perovskites of the form AB2X
3 ,
from which only 203 compounds were considered stable for fur
ther density functional theory calculations16. An et al. sought to
find peptide sequences that would form condensed phases and
disparate dynamical properties7, yet no phaseseparating systems
were identified in an initial survey of 1,266 peptides listed in the
DisProt database17.
