Description:
Used in nanoparticle-based fluorescent probes for detecting heavy metal ions.

Text:
Likewise, recent progress in nanoparticlebased 
fluorescent probes such as those based on gold13 and silver nanoparticles14 as well as systems based 
on semiconductor quantum dots15 have proved as effective heavy metal ion detectors. Unfortunately, they also suffer from complexity of synthesis andor water solubility.
