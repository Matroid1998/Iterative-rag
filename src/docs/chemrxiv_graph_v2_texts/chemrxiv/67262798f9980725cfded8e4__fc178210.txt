Description:
A product generated during CO2RR.

Text:
Our results indicated that hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and formic acid (HCOOH) were the products 
generated during the CO2RR (Figure 4d and Figure S11). To 
verify that these products originated from the flowing CO2, 
a control experiment was carried out using constant
potential electrolysis in an argon (Ar) atmosphere instead 
of CO2. The absence of CO2RR products at all tested 
potentials in the Ar atmosphere confirmed that the detected 
products were indeed derived from CO2 and not from any 
other source (Figure S12). The Faradaic efficiency (FE) data 
demonstrated a significant increase in total efficiency with 
increasing potential, rising from 8 at 0.6 V to 74 at 1.4 
V (Figure 4d). Initially, at 0.6 V, no CO2RR products were 
obtained.
