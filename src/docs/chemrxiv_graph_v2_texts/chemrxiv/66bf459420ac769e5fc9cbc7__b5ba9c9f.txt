Description:
An anion transporter used to study the transport of carboxylates.

Text:
These 
factors make each carboxylate unique, hampering the direct comparison in transmembrane transport 
experiments. Furthermore, the limited number of carboxylates studied so far limits the understanding 
of the role of the organic moiety in this process. Herein, we conducted a systematic study into the role of the organic moiety in various carboxylates 
during their internalization into liposomes. We have examined the size, shape, number of RCOO 
groups, and presence of hydroxyl groups in the carboxylate anions (Figure 1). We have used various 
methods to study the spontaneous diffusion of carboxylates, as well as their transport by a reported 
bisureabased anion transporter (T1).23
