Description:
A mineral phase that is part of the structure of molecular iron oxides.

The large library of complexes produced therefrom allowed chemists to understand 
the processes by which larger clusters selfassemble, allowing some control over the resultant 
magnetic properties, targeting, for example, slow relaxation of the magnetisation,5 spin frustration,6 
or an enhanced magnetocaloric effect.7 
One interesting subset of species in this family are molecular iron oxides, an emerging class of 
materials whose structures, in the main, contain no bridging organic ligands and conform to mineral 
phases such as ferrihydrite and magnetite.8 As well as displaying fascinating magnetic behaviours, such 
species potentially have applications in a breadth of areas ranging from catalysis9 and battery 
technologies10 to biomedical imaging.11 
The striking structural similarties between the molecular iron oxides FeIII13,12 FeIII17,8,13 FeIII30,14 and 
FeIII3415 which all possess alternating layers or tetrahedral and octahedral FeIII ions has prompted 
us to speculate, and examine, whether very large molecular iron oxides, perhaps even rivalling the 
size and complexity of the polyoxometalates,15 can be isolated.
