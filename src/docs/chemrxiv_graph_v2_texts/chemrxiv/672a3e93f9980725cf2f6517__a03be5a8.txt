Description:
Dissolves upon contact with water, followed by a dormant period due to a superficially hydrated layer on its surface.

These methods are frequently combined with pore solution analysis and
30
thermodynamic calculations 1826 to shed light on the ongoing dissolution and precipitation processes. 31
Upon contact of CAC with water, a small amount of monocalcium monoaluminate (CA) dissolves,
32
which is followed by a dormant period 2729. Several models were proposed to explain the occurrence
33
of a dormant phase. All models propose a change in the surface chemistry of the cement particles
34
10, 30, 31. According to Fujii et al. 30, a superficially hydrated layer grows on the CA particle
35
surface and prevents further dissolution. After a critical thickness has been reached, the stress of
36
intruding water molecules destroys the layer.
