Description:
Exhibits catalytic abilities in metal-oxo compounds for CH bond activation.

Text:
Terminal highvalent metal oxo species have long been 
identified as key intermediates involved in the operation of 
the ubiquitous Cytochrome P4501 and Photosystem II2,3 
metalloenzyme families. Over the past decades, a plethora of 
synthetic analogs of these systems have been developed, some 
of them demonstrating impressive efficiency in CH bond 
activation and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions.4 
Perhaps the most studied metaloxo compounds are those of 
iron  exhibiting catalytic abilities unrivaled by other metal
oxos.
