A greenhouse gas contributing to global temperature rise.

Global anthropogenic CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions continue to rise year on year, resulting in a predicted global surface

temperature rise of 3.2oC (2.2  3.5oC) by 2100 if all implemented climate policy targets are reached 1, the Sixth Assessment

Report by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 
42 
1.5C (50) with no or limited overshoot, and those that limit warming to 2C (67), involve rapid and deep and, in most

cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade.
