Description:
Derivatives are primarily p-type with charge transfer mediated by a hole transfer process.

Polythiophenes are a class of conjugated con
ductive and semiconductive organic materials
which can be used in many electronic devices,
such as eldeect transistors1,2, organic so
lar cells35, chemical sensors610, and more11. The electronic properties of polythiophenes can
be tuned across a wide range by various syn
thetic substitutions of the parent thiophene
ring, which has enabled both fundamental stud
ies and many applications. The vast majority of polythiophene derivatives
are ptype, with the charge transfer mediated
by a hole transfer process1214. MarcusHush
charge transfer theory shows that the inter

the energy change required to distort geometry
upon a charge transfer, is one important factor
in the charge transfer rate and resulting charge
mobility1216.
