Description:
Exhibits high photocatalysis compared to ZIF8.

However, it is hard to find effective materials that can be used as adsorbents 
and photocatalysts simultaneously. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) such as zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are porous 
materials with the potential for various applications, including energy production and drug delivery 
10,1629. ZIFsbased materials such as ZIF8 (zincbased ZIFs) were reported as an effective 
adsorbent for organic dyes and carbon dioxide (CO2) 22,30,31. They can be classified to 1) pure ZIF
8; 2) nanoparticles modified ZIF8 such as ZnOZIF8 32,33; and 3) ZIF8derived ZnO loaded 
carbon (ZnONdoped C) 34. Despite ZIF8 exhibiting high performance as an adsorbent, it shows 
low photocatalytic performance due to its large bandgap (5.0 eV)35. ZnO exhibited high 
photocatalysis compared to ZIF83638.

Description:
Exhibits high adsorption and photocatalytic performance on methylene blue degradation under sunlight irradiation.

Text:
Also, MOFderived ZnOdoped C exhibited high 
adsorption and photocatalytic performance on methylene blue (MB) degradation under sunlight 
irradiation, as the presence of carbon would enhance the light absorption, reduce the recombination 
of photogenerated electronhole, and increase the MB around the photocatalytic active sites in
