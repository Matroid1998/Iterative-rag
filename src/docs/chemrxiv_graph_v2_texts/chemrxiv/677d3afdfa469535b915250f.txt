Description:
A metal whose residual presence poses challenges in industrial applications due to its costly and environmentally taxing removal.

Despite its efficacy and versatility, this reac
tion presents significant challenges for largescale produc
tion.21 Issues like batchtobatch variability, problematic 
byproducts, and the costly and environmentally taxing re
moval of residual palladium and toxic22 stannylated com
pounds hinder its practicality for industrial applications 
and the massproduction of reproducible and stable de
vices. Moreover, hardtoremove residual ligand or metallic 
impurities lower the material performances and stability 
over time.2325 Many precautions and parameters need to be 
taken into account to obtain a high quality material.26 Re
cent advances in CH arylation reactions have offered ele
gant and promising alternatives, eliminating the need for 
toxic stannylated reagents.18,27,28 That being said, these re
actions still suffers from similar pitfalls regarding sidereac
tions.
