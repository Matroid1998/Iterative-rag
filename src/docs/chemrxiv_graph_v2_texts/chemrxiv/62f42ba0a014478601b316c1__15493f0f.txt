Description:
A coating generated on the Zn anode in phosphate buffered solution.

Text:
When the batteries operate in phosphate
buffered solution, commonly employed to study physiological environments, the exposed Zn anode is 
shown to generate a zinc phosphate overcoating. This coating, however, does not impede the realization 
of high energy densities. We show that the batteries are able to switch on memristors and power actuators 
of similar sizes, demonstrating potential applicability to cellsized autonomous robots. With linear 
dimensions ranging from 10 to 100 m, they represent the first class of fullcell batteries capable of 
providing electricity to picolitersized machines.
