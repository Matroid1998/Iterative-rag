Description:
Tetrameric natural products characterized by the complex linkage of four naturally occurring tryptophans into a macrocyclic molecule with neuroprotective activity.

Cyctetryptomycin A and B (12) (Figure 1) are tetrameric nat
ural products that were isolated in 2021.1 These intriguing com
pounds are characterized by the complex linkage of four natu
rally occurring tryptophans into an unprecedentedly complex 
macrocyclic molecule. These natural products possess neuropro
tective activity and are expected to be effective in treating neu
rodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral scle
rosis), Alzheimers, and Parkinsons diseases.1 However, the to
tal synthesis of cyctetryptomycin A and B (12) has not yet been 
reported. In the present study, we developed a Zrcatalyzed scal
able C3C3 dimerization of tryptophan derivative and CttpC
catalyzed oxidative coupling of tryptophan and successfully pre
pared cyctetryptomycin A and B (12) in 8 steps.
