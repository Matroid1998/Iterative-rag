Description:
Produced alongside dinitrogen from ammonia conversion.

While 
the reduction of N2 to NH3 has been studied extensively, the development of molecular ammonia oxidation catalysts 
has only recently started gaining attention.4,5 Several molecular electrocatalysts have been developed to convert 
ammonia to dinitrogen and hydrogen, the reverse of the HaberBosch process. In particular, rutheniumbased mo
lecular catalysts were investigated by several groups, including the ones of Llobet and Bullock.68 Very recently, 
the application of nonnoble metalbased catalysts, such as iron, nickel and copper, has been explored, opening the 
possibilities for catalysis with more sustainable systems.915 Along with the discovery of nonnoble metal based 
catalysts for AO, the replacement of organic solvents with water was investigated.
