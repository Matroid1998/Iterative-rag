Description:
An anionic PFAS of high concern.

Text:
PFAS are a diverse group of chemicals with perfluorocarbon 
atoms13 and include a number of ionic compounds. For example, 
PFAS of highest concern to date, such as perfluorooctane 
sulfonate (PFOS) and carboxylate (PFOA) and many of their 
industrial substitutes, are anionic. Capturing sorption and 
partition properties for legacy, emerging, and premarket anionic 
PFAS is a prerequisite for their environmental fate assessment14 
but is not possible by using Kow for the reasons stated above. Recently, de Voogt et al.15,16 proposed isocratic reversed
phase liquid chromatography (LC) retention (or capacity) factors 
(k) measured with an octadecyl group bonded silica (C18) column 
as a hydrophobicity indicator for fluorinated and nonfluorinated 
anionic surfactants.
