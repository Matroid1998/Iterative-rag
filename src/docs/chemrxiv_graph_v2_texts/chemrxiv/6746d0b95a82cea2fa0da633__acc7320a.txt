Description:
Used in sodium ion batteries as a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries.

Text:
Sodium ion batteries are promising alternatives to complement lithium ion batteries in the modern energy storage 
market.1,2 The similarities between the intercalation chemistries of Na and Li have accelerated the quest for 
energydense Naion battery electrode materials during the last decade.3 Among sodiumbased cathodes, layered 
oxides (NaxTMO2, TM  transition metal) are one of the most attractive candidates. These materials tend to form 
into two main polytype structures, as distinguished by the Na environments Ptype structures accommodate Na 
within prismatic sites between neighboring TMO2 layers, whereas Otype ones exhibit octahedrally coordinated Na.
