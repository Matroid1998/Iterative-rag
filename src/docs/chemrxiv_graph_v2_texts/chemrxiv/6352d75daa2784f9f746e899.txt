Description:
Exhibits population transfer to triplet states on the timescale of 3.5 ps in its photodynamics.

Text:
The interest in intersystem crossings (ISC) or spin crossovers has been intensified by the advent of
femtosecond timeresolved spectroscopic studies showing that ISC may occur at the picosecond
timescale. In the case of xanthone,1 the 1n3ISC takes place within 2.0 ps right
after an ultrafast 11ninternal conversion (IC). Wolf et al. 2 have also obtained a
circumstantial experimental evidence of the population transfer to triplet states on the timescale
of 3.50.3 ps in the photodynamics of thymine. ElSayeds rule forbids ISC between singlet
and triplet (doublet and quartet, triplet and quintet, etc.) states with the same occupation scheme. For instance, the 13and 1n3nconversions are forbidden due to the lack of
orientational changes of spatial orbitals.
