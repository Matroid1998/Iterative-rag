Description:
Macrocyclic compounds known for their ability to complex with cations.

Text:
Due to their straightforward syntheses and promising hostguest 
properties, organic macrocycles received lots of scientific atten
tion, especially in supramolecular, medicinal and material com
munities.1 Ever since the seminal discovery of crown ethers in 
the mid1960s,2 there is a steady increase in research interest 
towards new types of macrocycles, and the quest for new appli
cations from these host molecules,311 including more classical 
ones, such as cyclodextrin,4 calixnarene,6 etc. and more re
cent ones, such as Stoddarts bluebox,7 Floods cyanostar,8 
Ogoshis pillarnarene,9 cycloparaphenylenes10 from a col
lective effort from Bertozzi, Jasti and Itami, etc, (Scheme 1a).
