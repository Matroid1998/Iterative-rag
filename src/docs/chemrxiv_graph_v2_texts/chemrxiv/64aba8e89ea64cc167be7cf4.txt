Description:
A metal with nine confirmed oxidation states.

Text:
Multiple oxidation states are typical for metals but quite rare for purely organic molecules. For instance, one of the most common metals  iron  has nine confirmed oxidation states, 19 while 
the best performing redoxactive organic molecules, 10 such as 2,3,5,6tetra(2pyridyl)pyrazine (tppz), 
11 tetrapyridophenazine (tphz), 12 hexakis(guanidino)benzene 13 or bipyridine and phenanthroline
based carbene architectures, 14 are characterized structurally in only up to four oxidation states. Despite the possibility of isolating various metalbased compounds in multitude of different oxidation 
states, true multivalency is rare among them because the redox reaction is usually associated with the 
exchange of the ligands resulting in a complete change of the chemical nature of the compound.
