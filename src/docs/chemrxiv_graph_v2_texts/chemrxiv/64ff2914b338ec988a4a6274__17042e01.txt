Description:
A highly mutagenic lesion and a product of oxidative damage to guanine.

Text:
In fact, amongst the four native DNA bases, G has the lowest
vertical ionization energy (VIE) in gas phase4 and in aqueous solution,5,6 and is thus consid
ered the most readily oxidizable5,79 and the most common target in this kind of attack. The
highly mutagenic 8oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesion, a product of oxidative damage to G, is indeed
the most common of all DNA defects.
