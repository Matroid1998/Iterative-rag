Description:
Complicated organic molecules that can be sourced from methanol.

Text:
Both hydroxyl radicals (OH) and methanol (CH3OH) are widely present in many chemistry related 
scenes, like atmosphere,1 combustion,24 and interstellar space.5 Methanol, the simplest alcohol, is a green, 
clean, renewable and pivotal energy source, which is well recognized not only as a fuel to reduce CO2 
emissions, but also as a source for a variety of complicated organic molecules, such as olefins, carbonyl 
compounds, peptides and polypeptides, and even RNA.6 Similar to the FClH  CH3OH reactions,710 
the reaction between OH and CH3OH has several product channels. The major channels are the hydrogen 
abstractions, 
OH  CH3OH  H2O  CH2OH, (R1) 
OH  CH3OH  H2O  CH3O.
