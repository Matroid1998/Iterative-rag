Description:
Provide evidence for direct transmission of electron conjugation across a delectron ferrocene and ruthenocene.

Text:
The reported 
ferroceno and ruthenocenoporphyrinoids provide evidence for 
direct transmission of electron conjugation across a delectron 
ferrocene and ruthenocene, respectively (1, 2; Figure 1).2,3 In the 
case of ruthenocenothiaporphyrin and ruthenocenoporphyrin, the 
corresponding macrocyclic antiaromaticity and aromaticity 
observed for the same number of  electrons were controlled by 
the mutual orientation of the cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings.3 
Recently, the effective conjugation through dorbitals of the 
metal center, resulting in the antiaromatic character of the 
platinacorrole complex, has also been documented (3, Figure 
1).4 
The metallocene unit can be incorporated into the 
macrocyclic platform in three different modes 1,1; 1,2 and 1,3, 
as shown in Figure 2. To date, several bridged 1,1metallocene 
macrocycles have been reported.
