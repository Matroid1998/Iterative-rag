Description:
A material used as a sacrificial layer that can be etched by HCl-based wet chemical treatment.

Text:
In contrast, employing lanthanum strontium manganite (LSMO,
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3) as sacrificial layer, which can be etched by a HClbased wetchemical treatment,
enables the growth of allperovskite epitaxial heterostructures, offering additional potential for
high crystallinity and structural integrity of the desired freestanding thin film2325. Besides these
