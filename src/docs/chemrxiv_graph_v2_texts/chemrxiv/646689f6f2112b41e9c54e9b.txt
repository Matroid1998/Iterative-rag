Description:
Photolesions formed in nucleic acids upon exposure to ultraviolet light, which can impede function and cause mutations.

Text:
The integrity of genetic information is vital for all organ
isms on Earth. When exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, nu
cleic acids can form photolesions, such as cyclobutane py
rimidine dimers (CPDs),14 which can impede their function, 
cause mutations, or  in severe cases  lead to cell death.5,6 In 
modern organisms, enzymes,79 such as photolyases, repair 
such damage, e.g. via charge transfer (CT) of a photoelec
tron to the lesion. On the early Earth, an intramolecular pro
cess, UVinduced selfrepair (Fig.
