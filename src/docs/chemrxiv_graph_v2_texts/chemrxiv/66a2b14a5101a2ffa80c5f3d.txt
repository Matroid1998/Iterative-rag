The valorization of CO2 to formic acid, which is discussed as a liquid hydrogen carrier, nontoxic 
29 
source of carbon monoxide and represents an important industrial chemical with a growing 
30 
demand, has challenged chemists for several decades.14 Since the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to 
31 
formic 
acid 
is 
entropically 
unfavorable 
and 
thermodynamically 
restrained 
32 
(rG298 K  32.9 kJ mol1), the integration of deprotonating bases, solvating solvents or 
33 
esterification agents is often employed, turning the reaction exergonic.2,5 However, the resulting 
34 
isolation of the interacting formate causes a high energy demand for downstream processing and 
35 
sets prerequisites for the design of the crucial catalytic system.
