Asymmetric Catalysis. The field of asymmetric catalysis has revolutionized organic synthesis in the last 
24 
50 years. Catalysts have been developed to introduce stereogenic centers into molecules primarily through 
25 
the formation of new CC bonds and reduction of unsaturated bonds (e.g., carbonyls, alkenes). These chiral 
26 
catalysts can take many forms, including transition metal complexes, organocatalysts, and biocatalysts 
27 
(Figure 1). With transition metal complexes, the reaction is often catalyzed by the metal itself while 
28 
stereochemistry is introduced in the form of metal ligands (e.g., chiral phosphines). In organocatalysis and 
29 
biocatalysis, small organic molecules and enzymes function as both catalysts and chiral directing groups.
