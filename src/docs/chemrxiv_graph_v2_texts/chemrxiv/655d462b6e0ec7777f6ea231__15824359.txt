Description:
A greenhouse gas whose anthropogenic rise is the primary driver of climate change.

Text:
Among all greenhouse gas emissions, the anthropogenic rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide 
(CO2) since the beginning of the industrial age stands widely acknowledged as the primary driver 
of climate change, necessitating effective action to combat its impact on the environment 14. In 
response to this urgency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has put forth 
scenarios aimed at limiting the average temperature increase to below 2C by the end of this 
century, primarily through the reduction of CO2 emissions 1. To achieve this goal, two primary 
strategies have been proposed complete reliance on renewables (decarbonization) and the 
utilization of fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS), either independently or in 
combination 5.
