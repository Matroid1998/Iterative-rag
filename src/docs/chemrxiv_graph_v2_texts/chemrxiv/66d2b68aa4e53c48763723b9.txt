Description:
Formed upon calcination of organic precursors or complexing agents and influences the equilibrium conditions of LLZO formation.

Text:
As a consequence, excess Li is normally added to
compensate the Li loss1924 and the excess amount is expected to affect the phase evolution of
LLZO. The importance of the atmosphere during the synthesis has been reported in several
studies17,20,25. Solgel synthesis may involve organic precursors or complexing agents which
will form CO2 upon calcination and the partial pressure of CO2 at the surface of the resulting
powder has been shown to influence the equilibrium conditions of LLZO formation25. The formation of cubic and tetragonal polymorphs of LLZO compete during hightemperature
calcination and subsequent cooling26. Li vacancies are believed to stabilize the cubic phase
