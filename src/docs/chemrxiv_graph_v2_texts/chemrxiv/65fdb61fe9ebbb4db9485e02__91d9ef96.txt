Description:
Subject to computed excitation energies and oscillator strengths of vertical electronic transitions.

Text:
Computed excitation energies and oscillator strengths of vertical electronic tran
sitions of Ada 17, 2628 and AdaCN 16 were reported in the literature. Be
sides vertical excitations, vibrationally resolved absorption 28, 29 and photoelec
tron 12,29,30 spectra of Ada and Ada, respectively, were also calculated. For Ada
CN, Crandall et al. 16 calculated a vibrationallyresolved spectrum for a selected
band (D0 D11). We note that the absence of vibrationally resolved spectra for
other bands is caused by unsuccessful excitedstate optimizations of cationic diamon
doinds when using timedependent density functional theory 16,17,28,29. Recently,
