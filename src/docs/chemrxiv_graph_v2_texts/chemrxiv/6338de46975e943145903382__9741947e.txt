Description:
Sites in sodium gallate that can be occupied by Zr or Ti to enhance sodium ion conductivity.

Sodiumion storage devices have been considered the most promising candidate for large
scale energy storage systems owing to sodium abundancy in nature and the low price of the 
resources compared to other candidates such as lithium 20. Hence, the development of high
performance sodiumion devices for applications in energy storage devices, including sodiumion 
batteries (SIBs) 21, sodiumsulfur batteries 22, sodiumair batteries 23, or sodiumion hybrid 
capacitors 24 is of great importance to improve synthesis and electrochemical properties for 
highly efficient utilization of renewable energies. High onedimensional sodium ion conductivity 
has been observed when a tetravalent ion like Zr! or Ti! occupied some of Ga! sites in sodium 
gallate, to form Na(.Zr(.Ga.O (hereafter NZGO) or Na(.Ti(.Ga.O (hereafter NTGO) 
16,25,26.
