Description:
Mentioned in review of methods to prepare enol ethers and alkyl aryl ethers.

Text:
3Chloro4methylphenyl propyl 1, and butyl 2 phenylcyanoacrylates (PCA) are 
synthesized and copolymerized with ethynyl benzene. 4Fluoro2methylphenyl 1
methylethyl 3, and 2methylpropyl 4 PCAs are prepared and copolymerized with 
styrene. 4Fluoro3phenoxyphenyl methyl 5, ethyl 6, propyl 7, and 1methylethyl 
8, similarly to 4chlorophenoxy)phenyl 1,1dimethylethyl 9, 4(4fluorophenoxy)
phenyl butyl 10, and 3phenoxyphenyl 1,1dimethylethyl 11 PCAs are used as 
comonomers in radical copolymerization. 14(1,1Dimethylethyl)1cyclohexen1yl
oxy2fluorobenzene was mentioned in review of methods to prepare enol ethers 12; 
in review of methods to prepare alkyl aryl ethers by substitution 13, and in palladium
catalyzed aryl enol ether synthesis from vinyl triflates 14.
