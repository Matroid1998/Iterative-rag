Description:
Undergoes electrochemical reduction to produce glyoxylic acid.

Text:
Glyoxylic acid (GA) is an important organic acid in the chemical, cosmetic, 
pharmaceutical, and food industries. It is found in plants and involved in the 
metabolic cycle of animals. Glyoxylic acid is produced in several ways; by nitric 
acid oxidation of glyoxal, by catalytic oxidation of ethylene or acetaldehyde, and by 
electrochemical reduction of oxalic acid 1. The determination of glyoxylic acid in its electrochemical synthesis reaction mixture 
is a difficult process because this mixture contains carboxylic acids with convergent 
acidic dissociation constants and other compounds carrying organic groups that can 
undergo oxidation or reduction such as ethylene glycol, glyoxal and glycolic acid.
