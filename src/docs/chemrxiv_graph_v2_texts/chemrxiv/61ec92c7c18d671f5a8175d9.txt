Description:
A dye used to measure the aggregation of peptides.

Text:
Peptides, especially 
in solution during storage or manufacture, can undergo conformational change from  helical 
structure to  sheets, then aggregate or form fibrils. These pathways of physical instability are 
undesirable due to their potential risk of immunogenic responses and impacting bioavailability.7,8 
Thus, aggregation is a key physical stability parameter of formulated peptide product and need 
to be evaluated. One method for measuring the aggregation of peptides is through the use of 
Thioflavin T (ThioT). The knowledge gained from stability studies will be used to guide the design 
of formulation, establishment of shelf life and determination of proper storage and packaging 
conditions. Depending on the stage of drug development, the duration of stability study ranges
