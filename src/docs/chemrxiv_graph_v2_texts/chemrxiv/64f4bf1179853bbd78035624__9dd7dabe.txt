Description:
A compound with signals in the 11B NMR spectrum that are 64.7 ppm apart, with B2 resonating at the highest field and B1 at the lowest field.

Text:
For example, the signals from B1 and B2 
in the 11B NMR spectrum of nB9H15 are  64.7 ppm apart, such that B2 resonates at the highest field and B1 at 
the lowest field in the aforementioned 11B NMR spectrum,6 in spite of both B1 and B2 in nB9H15 exhibiting 
identical connectivity, hybridisation and even immediate bonding environment (Fig. 1).
