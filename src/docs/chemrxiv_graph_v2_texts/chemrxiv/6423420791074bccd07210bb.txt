Homoallylic 
amines 
are 
important 
precursors 
in 
biologically active compounds of both natural and 
synthetic origin.1,2 Access to heterocycles of various ring 
sizes ranging from azetidines (four) and pyrrolidines (five) 
to piperidine and quinoline analogues (six) demonstrates 
the versatile utility of this particular scaffold.37 Homoallylic 
amines are typically prepared via the allylation of imine 
substrates in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Examples 
of allyl nucleophiles include allylstannanes and allylic or
ganometallics,8 however these reagents can suffer from air 
and moisture sensitivity.9,10 Allylsilanes can be used in a Sa
kuraiHosomi reaction of imines,11 and have become in
creasingly popular for environmental and stability reasons. Their reactivity can be modulated by fluoride sources that 
serve as activators to generate pentavalent silicates.

Description:
Products of reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones.

Text:
In previous work with 1hydrosilatrane, we developed 
metal and fluoridefree onepot procedures for the direct 
reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones to 2 and 3 
amines.17,18 We envisioned it might be possible to intercept 
the imine intermediate instead with 1allylsilatrane to form 
new CC bonds during the course of reductive amination 
and produce valuable building blocks that are amenable to 
further modifications. While not yet commercially available, 
1allylsilatrane can be synthesized from readily available 
starting materials on a multigram scale in high yields.1922 
Herein, we report a metal and fluoridefree procedure to 
access benzaldehyde and anilinederived homoallylic 
amines using 1allylsilatrane. Scheme 1 Three component reactions to access 
homoallylic amines using allylsilanes.
