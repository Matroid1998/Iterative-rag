Description:
Al-substituted forms facilitate oxidation reactions and redox cycles with copper ions.

Text:
Copper ions exchanged onto Alsubstituted zeolites facil
itate various oxidation reactions and redox cycles, including 
NO decomposition,12 CO oxidation,34 NOx (x  1,2) selective 
catalytic reduction using NH3,59 and the partial oxidation of 
CH4 to form CH3OH in stoichiometric1017 and catalytic1819 
cycles.

Description:
Cu-exchanged zeolites are treated with O2 to form CuxOy species.

The dependence of methanol yields (per Cu) on re
action conditions (e.g., reactant pressure, temperature, 
time) has been well studied;11, 14, 17, 2324 however, compara
tively few investigations describe the series of steps respon
sible for the activation of O2 molecules or the kinetics and 
formation of active CuxOy complexes.11, 22, 24 
Nearly two decades of research have sought to identify 
the CuxOy species that form upon O2 activation treatments 
of Cuexchanged zeolites and produced numerous pro
posals (e.g., bis(oxo)dicopper,1, 10 mono(oxo)dicop
per,11, 13, 16, 2224 (22)peroxo dicopper,25 trans1,2
peroxo dicopper,13, 22 bis(hydroxyl)dicopper26, mono(
oxo)tricopper2729). Initial reports from Groothaert et al. combined in situ extended Xray absorption fine structure
