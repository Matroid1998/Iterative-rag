Description:
A scaffold used in chemical libraries for developing PD1-PDL1 small molecule inhibitors.

Text:
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) is an immune checkpoint receptor implicated for 
the creation of new cancer therapeutics.1 The prolonged interaction between the Tcell receptor 
and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) leads to upregulation of PD1 on the activated 
Tcell surface.2 Activated T cells produce cytokines, such as Interferon, which in turn cause 
tumor cells to express programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) on the their cell surface.2 Tumors 
escape the action of immune system by utilizing the interaction between PD1 and ligand PDL1 
resulting in lower effector Tcell function and survival, as such resulting in a suppressive immune 
response in the tumor microenvironment.2 The inhibition of the PD1PDL1 interaction can 
enhance antitumor immunity and a large amount of work has been done to develop monoclonal 
antibodies as inhibitors of PD1PDL1 interaction inhibitors.3,4 For example, pembrolizumab, 
cemiplimab, and nivolumab are three FDA approved antiPD1 monoclonal antibodies.4 The 
discovery of smallmolecule inhibitors would be an advantageous over monoclonal antibodies, 
such as being fastacting, simple for in vivo administration, ability to penetrate through cell 
membranes and interact with the cytoplasmic domains of cell surface receptors.5 Since a few 
years, there has been significant development in designing PD1PDL1 inhibitors.6,7 Specifically, 
BristolMyers Squibb (BMS) discovered a set of potent PD1PDL1 small molecule inhibitors 
based on the peptidomimetic molecules and nonpeptidic small molecules.6,7 In particular, BMS 
revealed a 2methyl3biphenylmethanol scaffold containing chemical libraries.
