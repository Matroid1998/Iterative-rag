Description:
Captured by physical solvents like Selexol through nonbonded interactions.

Text:
Furthermore, the required scale for deploying these solutions 
(7.6 Gtyr) is 190x times larger than the current global 
capacity for CCS (0.04 Gtyr).16 This significant gap leaves a 
narrow window for both technological development and the 
implementation of such a substantial increase in capacity.17 
The 
most 
scalable 
capture 
technology 
employed 
commercially today are liquid solvents. Physical solvents like 
Selexol (a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol) 
work by dissolving CO2 through nonbonded electrostatic and 
van der Waals interactions. Selexol is primarily effective in 
precombustion highpressure environments, limiting its 
application to specific industries like hydrogen production.18 
In contrast, chemical solvents, primarily amines, have a 
broader scope due to their reversible reaction with CO2.

Description:
A compound that requires 3.67 GJ/ton for capture using monoethanolamine, depending on plant configuration.

Since 
1930, aminebased systems have achieved multimegaton per 
year worldwide capacity, primarily used for natural gas 
scrubbing.3 Reaching Gtyear capacity necessitates extending 
to other CO2emitting industries. However, amines have 
struggled to gain traction in these sectors due to their cost, 
which arises from their high process energy consumption, 
need for steam as an energy transfer medium, and high 
degradation rates. The most commonly used amine, 
monoethanolamine (MEA), which was developed in the early 
1900s, requires 3.67 GJton CO2 depending on plant 
configuration,2 and degrades rapidly,19,20 in addition to being 
volatile and corrosive.

Description:
A gas that is captured using amine blends in carbon capture processes.

Text:
Research efforts in solventbased carbon capture have 
focused on addressing such problems through the 
development of new amines,10,20,21 additives,20,22 and 
corresponding 
process 
and 
capital 
equipment23,24 
optimizations to lower energy requirements20,2427 and 
degradation rates.2833 For instance, amine blends such as KS
1, Shells Cansolv solvent, have lowered the regenerated heat 
requirement to 2.32.4 GJton CO2.26 However, even these 
improved solvents demand considerable energy, highlighting 
the need for more efficient alternatives. To understand why it 
remains difficult to decrease the regeneration energy penalty, 
we consider the mechanisms of carbon capture in amines
