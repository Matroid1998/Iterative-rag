Description:
Involved in ion transport through channel proteins such as the potassium channel.

In an eort to solve this compli
cated optimization problem, molecular simulations have
proven indispensable, providing valuable insights about
nanoporous membranes based on graphene,1620 metal
organic frameworks (MOFs),21 and polymers.22,23
A second example is biological channel proteins, which
modulate the transport of ions through cellular and or
ganellar membranes. They generally possess extraordi
nary levels of ionwater and ionion selectivity, yet there
are signicant gaps in our understanding of the molec
ular origins of such selectivity. Similar to water de
salination, various techniques in molecular simulations
have been used to investigate dierent aspects of water
and ion transport through channel proteins,24 such as
aquaporins2527 and the potassium channel.28,29
Despite their potential, the accuracy of molecular sim
ulations depends on a multitude of implementation de
tails.
