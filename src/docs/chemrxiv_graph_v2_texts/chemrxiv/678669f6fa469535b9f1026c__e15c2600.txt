Magnesium alloys possess optimal weighttostrength ratio, high thermal conductivity, and 
55 
weigh around 25 less than Al alloys with comparable properties. It makes them promising 
56 
materials for aerospace and automotive industries, where reduction of weight while keeping high 
57 
exploitation properties is an urgent task 14. 58 
Among Mg alloys, MgAlZnMn alloys (AZ series), are one of the most widely used Mg 
59 
alloys. Alloying with Al improves the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of the alloys 
60 
with little impact on their density 4. At the same time, alloying with Zn improves physical 
61 
characteristics, while alloying with Mn slightly improves the corrosion resistance of these alloys 
62 
by hindering the cathodic activity of Ferich intermetallic particles (IMPs) AlMnFe 5,6.

Despite numerous advantages, the high reactivity and low corrosion resistance of 
72 
magnesium alloys limit their practical applications 15,16. The main factors affecting the 
73 
corrosion susceptibility of Mg alloys are local galvanic corrosion due to galvanic coupling between 
74 
the alloys matrix and IMPs and the low protective ability of a surface oxide film (the Pilling
75 
Bedworth ratio is 0.81) formed of the surface 4,17. 76 
For Licontaining Mg alloys of the AZseries, several types of IMPs were reported in the 
77 
literature Mg17Al12, MgxMey, and AlzMew ( are Li, Mn, Zn) 18.
