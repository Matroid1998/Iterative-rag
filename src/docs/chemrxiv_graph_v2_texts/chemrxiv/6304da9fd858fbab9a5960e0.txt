Description:
An antioxidant involved in free radical scavenging, with disputed mechanisms in polar media.

Text:
By and large, there is a consensus
that free radical scavenging by biorelevant antioxidants (e.g., dietary vitamins and drugs
against lipoprotein oxidation) proceeds as a singlestep process (HAT) in nonpolar solvents
and as a twostep process in polar solvents. The most popular disputes (for vitamin E
see, e.g., 1820) on the antioxidant activity are on whether SETPT or SPLET prevails in
polar media. The most frequent challenge related to this dilemma is that differentiating
between SETPT and SPLET is a difcult issue that cannot be merely couched in terms of
the antioxidants thermodynamical descriptors. An adequate analysis of the preferred radical scavenging mechanism should not only
consider the properties of the antioxidant but also the properties of the radical 19,21,22.
