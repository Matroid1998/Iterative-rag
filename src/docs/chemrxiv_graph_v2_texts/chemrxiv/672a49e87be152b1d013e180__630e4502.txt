Description:
Compounds for which transition metal-catalyzed N-arylation remains relatively underdeveloped.

Text:
Narylsulfonamides represent an important class of or
ganosulfur compounds, as exemplified by their presence 
among various FDAapproved drugs spanning multiple dis
ease indications.1 This motif is prevalent in drug discovery 
due to its polarity, geometry, hydrogen bonding properties, 
and tunable NH pKa (Figure 1A).2 Classically, Narylsulfona
mides can be synthesized via addition of anilines to sulfonyl 
chlorides; however, this approach is not always conducive 
to synthesis of druglike molecules due to the water sensi
tivity of sulfonyl chloride reagents and attenuated nucleo
philicity of electronpoor anilines. Furthermore, the poten
tial genotoxicity of both anilines and sulfonyl chlorides has 
inspired the development of alternate approaches.3,4 
Despite the recent emergence of numerous catalysts and 
synthetic methods for CN coupling, transition metalcata
lyzed Narylation of primary sulfonamides remains rela
tively underdeveloped.

Description:
Compounds with attenuated nucleophilicity, making them recalcitrant in cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
To the best of our knowledge, fewer 
than 40 reports have studied the direct Narylation of pri
mary sulfonamides, most of which feature high catalyst 
loadings andor high temperatures, with relatively limited 
scope examples.530 This may be, in part, due to the attenu
ated nucleophilicity of sulfonamides, which renders them 
recalcitrant in crosscoupling reactions. Selectivity poses 
an additional challenge for the coupling of primary sulfon
amides, given the possibility that the desired Narylated 
product can undergo further reaction to generate the unde
sired N, Ndiarylated product. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202422jrq ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000266410833 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
