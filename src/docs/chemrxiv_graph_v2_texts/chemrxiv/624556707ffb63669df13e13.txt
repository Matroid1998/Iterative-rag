Description:
Compounds that can be accessed through regio and stereoselective strategies involving transition metal-catalyzed cross coupling, CH activation, or metathesis.

Many regio and stereoselective strategies to access 
alkenes have been developed over the past decades and gener
ally involve transition metalcatalyzed cross coupling, CH ac
tivation or metathesis.15 With the increased focus on sustainable 
chemistry,6 the development of transition metalfree, regio and 
stereoselective alkenylations that proceed under mild conditions 
is highly important.7 
Vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) have recently been reported as 
novel hypervalent iodine(III) reagents sharing the same benzio
doxolone core as the popular ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBX) 
and Togni reagents.89 VBX compounds have already been em
ployed as electrophilic vinylation reagents under transition 
metalcatalyzed, photocatalytic and metalfree conditions with 
a variety of nucleophiles (Scheme 1a).1011 VBX shows interest
ing reactivity under mild conditions without need for excess re
agents, and tolerates a variety of functional groups.
