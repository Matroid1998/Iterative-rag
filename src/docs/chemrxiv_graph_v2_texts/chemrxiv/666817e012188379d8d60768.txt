Description:
A transition metal used as a catalyst in enantioselective cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
In contrast, the twocomponent enantioselective crosscoupling of sp3hybridized electrophiles with various arylation reagents, 
which is catalyzed by transition metals such as nickel, cobalt, and iron, has emerged as a powerful alternative, particularly for the 
construction of challenging C(sp3)C(sp2) bonds.
