Description:
A common host lattice for upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs).

Text:
There are many possible host lattices for UCNPs, 1013 with NaYF4 
being most common.14 The longlived excited states of the lanthanide ions (typically 100 s to 10 ms)15 
enables multiphoton absorption and subsequent upconversion process, where multiple lowenergy photons 
are absorbed and converted into a higher energy photon.16 UCNPs can absorb and emit light at various 
wavelengths, primarily dependent on the choice of photoactive dopants hosted within the UCNP lattice 
structure. Sensitizers include Yb3 (976 nm), Nd3 (808 nm) and Er3 (1532 nm).17,18 Er3 and Tm3 are 
common emissive activator ions, enabling emission from UV to visible at discrete linelike wavebands.1921
