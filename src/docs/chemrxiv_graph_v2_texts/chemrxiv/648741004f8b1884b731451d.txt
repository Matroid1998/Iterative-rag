The increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the single most important anthro
25
pogenic cause of global warming. Decreasing the release of CO2 into the atmosphere requires
26
efficient CO2 capture and separation technologies. Decades of research have been devoted to
27
improving existing gas separation technologies, but there is still an imminent need to find new
28
methodologies given the current course of climate change (1). Traditional unit operations have
29
the ability to isolate highpurity products, but they have a high carbon footprint due to the high
30
energy requirements. Membranebased technologies are an attractive alternative because they
31
provide savings in capital and energyrelated operating costs, and offer advantages related to the
32
ease of operation and compact environmental footprint (24).
