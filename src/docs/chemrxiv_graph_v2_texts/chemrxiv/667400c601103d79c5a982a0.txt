denote the mineral CaTiO3. It was named after Lew Alexejewitsch Perowski, a russian 
politician and mineralogist. Meanwhile, the term perovskite is more widely used for the 
structure type family with the general sum formula ABX3. Perovskites are renowned for their 
structural and compositional flexibility which exhibits variations on both the cation A 13 and B 
cation 4, 5, as well as on the anion sublattice 2, 611.
