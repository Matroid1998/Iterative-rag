Description:
A gas with high storage capacity in porous organic crystals.

The assessment of ESF maps of candidate molecules for a targeted function can help rule
out molecules with no (or only high energy) predicted structures with the required properties and
prioritize the synthesis of molecules with promising predicted structures. The approach has suc
cessfully led to the discovery, crystallization and characterization of a porous organic crystal with
exceptionally high porosity and methane storage capacity.14
ESF maps can be produced for any functional material where the relevant property is calcula
ble from the crystal structure.
