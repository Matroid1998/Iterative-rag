Glyphosate is used to control many weeds.1 Due to its extensive use in agriculture, 
45 
horticulture, forestry, and urban environments, glyphosate is frequently detected in soils, water 
46 
bodies, food, and human fluids.211 Additionally, transformation of laundry additives in 
47 
wastewater (e.g., aminopolyphosphonates used as antiscalants) have been identified as a new 
48 
source of glyphosate in European rivers.12 Detection of glyphosate and its byproducts, 
49 
specifically aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), occurs despite their immobilization by 
50 
microorganisms, abiotic degradation, or retention on metal oxides in soils.1319 Increased public 
51 
concern regarding its potential toxicity and presence in the environment underscores the 
52 
importance of research into its persistence and interactions within ecosystems.

Description:
Undergoes degradation through microbial activity and abiotic mechanisms, forming AMPA and other products.

Text:
53 
Glyphosate primarily undergoes degradation through microbial activity, with additional 
54 
contributions from abiotic mechanisms, which remain poorly understood.20 Whether via biotic or 
55 
abiotic mechanisms (Scheme S1), the degradation of glyphosate may occur through C(2)N bond 
56 
cleavage, which forms AMPA (AMPA pathway), a more toxic and resistant metabolite than 
57 
glyphosate;2123 andor through C(3)P bond cleavage (sarcosine pathway), which yields 
58 
innocuous products (i.e., sarcosine and then glycine).16 A third degradation pathway (glycine 
59 
pathway; C(3)N bond cleavage) has also been proposed due to the inability to detect 
60 
sarcosine.2426 The abiotic transformation and persistence of glyphosate and its byproducts vary 
61 
significantly depending on environmental conditions.

Description:
Its halflife ranges widely across soils and is influenced by adsorption potential.

Text:
For example, the halflife (t12) of 
62 
glyphosate ranges widely across soils (t12  2174 days).19, 25, 27, 28 This variation is strongly 
63 
influenced by adsorption potential.2, 27 Clayrich soils with high organic matter content and low 
64 
pH typically exhibit lower halflives due to greater glyphosate adsorption. In a model waterMn 
65 
oxide catalytic system, which is the most commonly used system in studies of glyphosate
