Description:
Ligands of choice for many C-C and C-N bond-forming transformations in Pd-catalyzed cross-couplings.

Text:
Transition metalcatalyzed crosscouplings are among the most 
practical and widely used bondforming reactions in the 
construction of small molecules.1,2 The modernday success of 
these methodologies is due in large part to ancillary ligand and 
precatalyst development, aided by thorough mechanistic 
investigations.1,3 For Pdcatalyzed crosscouplings, the dialkyl
orthobiaryl phosphines developed by Buchwald, Beller, and 
others has emerged as the ligand class of choice for many CC 
and 
CN 
bondforming 
transformations.48 
Extensive 
mechanistic studies have been carried out to elucidate the 
structurereactivity relationships (SRRs) of these phosphines 
with Pd (Figure 1A).6,913 In brief, Buchwaldtype ligands can 
promote the formation of highly reactive monoligated (L1) Pd 
through increased steric pressure from the Bring positioned 
within the metals first coordination sphere.
