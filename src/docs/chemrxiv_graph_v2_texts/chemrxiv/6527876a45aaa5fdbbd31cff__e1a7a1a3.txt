Description:
Radical derivatives that can stably luminesce at room temperature.

Text:
Only a few free radicals 
that can stably luminesce at room temperature, e.g., triarylme
thyl radical derivatives1519 and Nheterocyclic carbenebased 
radicals have been reported so far.20 However, the design, syn
thesis, and purification of these radicals is relatively compli
cated given their high reactivity.21 This complexity has so far 
hampered progress in the design and development of fluores
cent radicals. Hence, developing new strategies to generate and 
analyze fluorescent radicals remains highly desirable. In this context, we focused on the mechanochemical genera
tion of diarylacetonitrile (DAAN) radicals in a polymer matrix. Although DAAN radicals are known to be fluorescent,2224 their 
luminescence properties have not yet been adequately studied.
