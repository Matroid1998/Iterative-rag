Description:
A light element used in lithium-ion batteries for energy storage.

Among them, organic electrodes have garnered significant 
attention due to their many advantages, including abundant sources (often derived from biomass), 
tunable structures, low cost, environmental friendliness, and their composition of light elements (C, 
H, O, N, S).1315 Small organic molecules, a subset of organic electrodes, have demonstrated poor 
performance due to their tendency to dissolve in aprotic electrolytes, which leads to poor cycling 
stability.16 However, organic polymers, synthesized via the condensation of small molecules, can 
reduce dissolution due to their high molecular weight.17 The structural diversity of polymers 
suggests that the wide variety of organic materials with different functional lithium storage groups 
provides ample opportunities for innovation in this field.18 Consequently, organic polymerbased 
electrode design is considered a promising solution for the development of future highenergy
density LIBs.18, 19 
COFs, as a new class of crystalline porous organic polymers, possess some unique properties 
that make them promising candidates for LIBs.20, 21 Notably, their stable frameworks, large surface
