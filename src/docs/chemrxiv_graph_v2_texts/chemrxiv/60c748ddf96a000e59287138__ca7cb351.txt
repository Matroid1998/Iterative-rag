Description:
Positively charged components of PEDOTPSS.

Text:
While the number of organic semiconductors  both small molecules and polymers  is
large and growing,17 there are only very few examples of highly conductive organic
materials, one of them being poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate
(PEDOTPSS).813 PEDOTPSS is a mixture of two ionomers, negatively charged PSS
with deprotonated sulfonate groups and positively charged PEDOT oligomers. PEDOTPSS is mostly used as a conductive, transparent thin film in organic electronics
