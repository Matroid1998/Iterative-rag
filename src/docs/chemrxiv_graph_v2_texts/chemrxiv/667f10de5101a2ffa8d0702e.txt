Description:
A primary electrolyte involved in maintaining cellular osmotic balance.

Text:
Examples of abiotic stress eliciting callose formation are the contact
with toxic heavy metals,18 the scarcity or loss of water, high temperature, or the imbalance in
the concentration of primary electrolytes such as Na, K and Ca2.19 Biotic stress includes
pathogenic infections by bacteria, viruses and fungi,20 but may also result from the feeding
of parasitic species, such as insects, worms, etc.
