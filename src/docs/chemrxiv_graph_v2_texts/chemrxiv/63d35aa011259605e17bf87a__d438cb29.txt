Description:
A type of fatty acid that can be methylated to form cyclopropane fatty acids.

Text:
Another less common strategy for some specific microorganisms is cyclopropanation 
of the lipid acyl chains that protect the membrane from adverse effects of freezing during 
drastic cooling2934. Lipids with cyclopropane ring containing fatty acids (LCFA) are widely 
distributed in a variety of organisms, particularly in bacteria, e.g., Escherichia coli, 
Lactobacillus, Rhizobium,32 etc. They are generated in situ via methylation of the cis
unsaturated fatty acid double bond in presence of cyclopropane fatty acid synthase and the 
concentration of LCFAs rises as the cell is exposed to a hostile condition29, 3137. LCFAs are 
known to disrupt the ordering of the lipid acyl chains and thereby keep the membrane fluid at 
lower temperatures38,1, 31. Similar effect of LUFA is already known719 .
