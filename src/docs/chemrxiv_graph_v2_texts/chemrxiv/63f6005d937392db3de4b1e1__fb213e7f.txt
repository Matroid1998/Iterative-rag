Description:
An unsaturated compound that can coordinate with nickel(0) in catalytic processes.

Text:
Mechanistically, the underlying nickelcatalyzed C(sp2)H bond activation process operates 
via a ligandtoligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT)29 instead of the typical oxidative addition 
process30. The C(sp2)C(sp3)reductive elimination is considered as the rate determining step 
(Figure 1b). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that an extension of this concept could 
help to address the C(sp3)H bond of ketones under comparable conditions and open new 
catalysis manifold for ketone functionalizations (Fig. 1c). This pivotal step could be either 
envisaged by coordination of the ketone and acceptor olefin to the nickel(0) triggering a LLHT 
of the carbonyl C(sp3)H. The LLHT would involve a 7membered transition state and lead 
to a favorable oxaallyl nickel(II) species. Alternatively, one could formulate a C(sp3)H 
oxidative addition forming oxaallyl nickel(II) hydride.

Description:
A compound that can insert into alkyl nickel intermediates.

Text:
Subsequent insertion of the olefin 
would lead to the same alkyl nickel intermediate. The energy barrier of a straight C(sp3)C(sp3) 
reductive elimination leading to direct 1,2hydroalkylation product is higher than a 
corresponding C(sp2)C(sp3) reductive elimination31. We thus hypothesized that the enhanced 
lifetime of the alkyl nickel intermediate would allow to trigger complexitygenerating 
downstream reactions. For instance, alkyl Ni(II) species can engage in chainwalking processes 
32,33,34,35,36,37. In the present context such increased molecular complexity comes together with 
challenges of controlling regio, diastereo, and ultimately enantioselectivity. Capitalizing on 
our longstanding experience in the design and application of chiral NHC ligands for Ni(0)
catalyzed CH functionalizations,38,39,40,41,42 we initiated the development of a competent 
catalyst system to address these challenges and channel.
