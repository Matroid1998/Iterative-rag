Description:
A prototypical compound studied for its excited state landscape using transient optical absorption spectroscopy and transient X-ray emission spectroscopy.

Such hot CT chromophores have been demonstrated
with highZ (Cotic2024) and to a lesser extent, with lowZ TMC (Sinha2022, Zhang2023),
for bimolecular chemical reactions and shortrange CT to surfaces. However, both design
and optimization remain highly challenging due to the complexities associated with the
experimental and theoretical mapping of competing pathways in multidimensional energy
landscapes. Elucidating the mechanisms of deactivation in benchmark systems lays a solid
ground for devising innovative strategies capable of harnessing the underlying processes in
rationally tailored systems. In this work, multitechnique probing with transient optical absorption spectroscopy (trOAS)
and transient Xray emission spectroscopy (trXES) are combined with Fulldimensional
Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH) dynamics simulations to establish a clear correlation
between CT and bifurcation in the excited state landscape of a prototypical Ni(II) porphyrin
(NiP).
