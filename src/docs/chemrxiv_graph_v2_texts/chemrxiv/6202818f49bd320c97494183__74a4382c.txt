Description:
Salts involved in synthesis and catalysis.

Text:
Our group is interested in the synthesis and reactivity of novel cyclic iodonium salts as 
well as their use in catalysis. We developed two onepot procedures for the synthesis 
of carbonbridged cyclic iodonium salts.9 Based on these recent findings, we now want 
to report a unique onepot synthesis of O and Nbridged iodonium triflates 1 and 2 by 
treating substituted phenols and anilines with in situ generated arynes (Scheme 1, b).
