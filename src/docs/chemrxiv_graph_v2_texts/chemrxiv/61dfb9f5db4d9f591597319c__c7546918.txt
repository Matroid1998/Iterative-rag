Description:
Catalyst used in the formation of CC and Cheteroatom bonds.

Text:
Nickel catalysis has seen tremendous advances in recent 
years, resulting in the development of diverse methodologies 
for the formation of CC and Cheteroatom bonds (Figure 
1A).17 These catalytic reactions span fields such as Niphoto
redox, Nielectrocatalysis and crosselectrophile coupling, and 
are enabled by the facile accessibility of numerous Ni oxidation 
states.8 Crucially, this includes not only the common Ni(0) and 
Ni(II) oxidation states, but also the oddelectron Ni(I) and 
Ni(III) oxidation states. Consequently, 1 and 2electron pro
cesses can be combined in many ways to execute distinct trans
formations.8,9 
An important and widely proposed mechanistic event is the 
oxidative addition of aryl halides to Ni(I), generating a Ni(III) 
aryl complex (Figure 1A).
