Highly selective membranes are the key ma
terials needed to perform ecient separations
of the components of complex aqueous streams
in applications ranging from chemical process
ing to water purication to environmental re
mediation.1 Several materials have been pro
posed as candidates for the next generation de
salination and nanoltration membranes, such
as graphene,2 graphene oxide,3 carbon nan
otubes,4 among others.5 While individual chan
nels in these materials show excellent trans
port properties, fabricating and aligning them
in large scale is a daunting challenge.6
Biomimetic lipidlike amphiphilic monomers
oer a promising way to overcome the fab
rication challenge as they can self assemble
and be crosslinked into highly selective, nanos
tructured lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) mem
branes.7 Such selfassembly can be exploited
in experiments to synthesize membranes with
nanostructured channels.810 These LLC poly
mer membranes can be customized by changing
monomer components, counterions, solvent, ad
ditives, and their composition, allowing them
to organize in a variety of ways with dierent
structure and permeability to solutes.1113
In contact with polar andor nonpolar sol
vent, hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads of
these amphiphilic monomers can selforganize
into distinct regions in a wide range of packing
symmetry, depending on the relative compo
sition, temperature, and pressure.14 The most
common phases of LLC membranes are lamel
lar, hexagonal, and bicontinuous cubic (Q).
