Description:
An amide resistant to deprotonation even by nBuLiKOtBu superbase mixtures.

The use of sterically demanding ligands to enforce lowcoordination geometries upon d and fblock 
metal centres remains an area of interest for inorganic chemists.15 Such complexes are typically highly 
reactive and thus capable of acting as a catalyst or activating small molecules.3,615 These complexes 
can also display unusual physical properties, such as single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour.1625 
The use of amides as sterically demanding ligands dates to the 1960s, with the use of the N(SiMe3)2 
ligand to isolate twocoordinate dblock complexes.2628 Since then, a wide array of bulky silylamide 
ligands have been developed and utilized, such as N(Dipp)(SiMe3).14,2935 More recently, the 
exceedingly bulky KN(SiiPr3)2 has been applied to the synthesis of linear fblock species, which display 
large magnetic anisotropy and have the potential for extremely high Ueff values (Ueff  barrier to 
magnetization,3638 as well as group 2 Lewis acidic cations.39 Most recently, investigations of (tBu3Si)2NH 
showed the amide to be resistant to deprotonation even by nBuLiKOtBu superbase mixtures.
