Description:
Supports the formation of covalent bonding networks.

Text:
In these structures, the light boron atoms
support the formation of covalent bonding networks, while the heavy TM s are intrinsically
incompressible due to their high valence electron density, properties well understood to
promote hardness.1,3,12
Incorporating TM s into superhard materials discovery eorts unearths a vast, underex
plored compositional space and provides an excellent opportunity to investigate new ma
terials compositions with optimized mechanical properties. Although superhard materials
of this type are often impractical as candidates for industrial use as the TM s employed
can be expensive and scarce, sustainability concerns can be addressed through elemental
substitution of the expensive, rareearth TM s with more earthabundant metals.2 TM sub
stitution can also modify valence electron concentration (VEC) and atomic size eects to
tailor mechanical properties.
