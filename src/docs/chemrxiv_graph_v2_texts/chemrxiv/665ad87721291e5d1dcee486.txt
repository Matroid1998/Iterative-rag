Description:
Radicals with extremely long lifetimes suitable for applications in spectroscopy, particularly in structural biology.

Nitroxides (aminoxyl radicals) are a class of stable organic 
radicals where the unpaired electron is stabilized by steric 
shielding and delocalisation over the NO bond. 1 The extremely 
long lifetimes of nitroxide radicals render them suitable for various 
applications in spectroscopy, in particular for investigations in 
structural biology. Nitroxides have gained a unique place within 
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy as spin 
labels that can reveal dynamic and structural information in 
biomolecules. 2 Through a process known as sitedirected spin 
labelling (SDSL), nitroxides can be covalently attached to the 
biomolecule of interest, which is then analysed by EPR 
spectroscopy.
