Coresubsti
tuted Me2VBX was reported to give improved results in some 
cases.12 In parallel, the chemistry of bheteroatomsubstituted 
VBX reagents and their benziodoxole counterparts has also been 
developed.1315 
Methodology for transition metalfree vinylations from our lab 
highlights the intriguing reactivity of VBX reagents 1. The effi
cient, room temperature Svinylation of thiols 2 resulted in for
mation of internal alkenes 3 with retention of the VBX alkene 
configuration (Scheme 1b).1213, 1617 To the contrary, metalfree 
Pvinylation of phosphine oxides 4 or Hphosphinates delivered 
terminal alkenes 5 with complete regioselectivity (Scheme 
1b).18 The latter regiochemistry has only been observed under 
transition metalfree conditions with VBX.8, 18 
Literature reports of reactions with vinyl(aryl)iodonium salts, 
which are related iodine(III) reagents, indicate that various 
mechanisms can be operative under metalfree conditions.
