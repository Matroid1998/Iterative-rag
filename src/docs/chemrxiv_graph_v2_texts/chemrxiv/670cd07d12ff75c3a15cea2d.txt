Description:
Used as an oxidant in aerobic catalysts for alcohol oxidation.

Hence, the 
imperative is to develop green, selective, and efficient aerobic catalysts for alcohol oxidation, utilizing air 
or molecular oxygen as oxidants.4 Several homogeneous catalysts have been developed in the past decades 
based on transition metals;5 on the other hand, heterogeneous catalysis offers important advantages over 
homogeneous processes in terms of product isolation, catalyst separation, and recycling, and it has a higher 
potential for the development of sustainable chemical processes. The main application of alcohol oxidation in the industry is, by far, the oxidation of methanol to 
formaldehyde.6 Two are the main processes the PerstorpReichhold Formox process and the BASF process. The former is an oxidative dehydrogenation over a mixed Fe and Mo oxide; the reaction is exothermic, and 
relatively mild conditions (300 C).
