Description:
A dihydrate (CaSO4Â·2H2O) used in plasterboard and stucco manufacturing, construction, and fireproofing.

Text:
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO40.5H2O), also known as bassanite,
has been used as a precursor to produce gypsum (dihydrate, CaSO42H2O) for
various
construction
and
decorative
purposes
since
prehistoric
times1. Nowadays, it is widely used for plasterboard and stucco manufacturing,
construction, fireproofing, biomedical applications, and even some forms of 3D
printing. It is estimated that 100200 million tonnes are used each year25,
making it one of the most widely consumed mineral resources. However, as
there are
no significant natural deposits of bassanite existing on the Earths
surface, it has to be synthesized. The main route to obtain hemihydrate is a
thermal treatment of gypsum at temperatures typically between 150 C and 200
C to remove some of the structural water6.

Description:
Formed from hemihydrates when they come into contact with water, through an exothermic hydration process.

Depending on the method used, 
or hemihydrates are obtained either in humidwet conditions or in dry air. Both
types of hemihydrate will revert to gypsum when in contact with water,
undergoing an exothermic hydration process that leads to the setting and
