Description:
Includes entities like trifluoromethyl alkanes and gem difluoroalkenes, commonly found in bioactive molecules.

Text:
The introduction of fluorine into target molecules significantly alters their physichemical and 
biochemical properties, including dipole moment, hydrogen bonding, lipophilicity, and metabolic 
stability16. Currently, approximately 20 of pharmaceuticals and 3040 of pesticides on the market 
contain fluorine. Among the various organofluorine entities, trifluoromethyl alkanes and gem
difluoroalkenes are particularly important and commonly found in bioactive molecules (Figure 1) 717. Consequently, the development of broadly applicable reactions that can efficiently produce both types of 
molecules from the same substrate by modulating reaction conditions has gained considerable attention 
owing to the merits of distinguished efficiency and rapid buildup of molecular diversity. Figure 1. Representative examples of bioactive trifluoromethyl alkanes and gemdifluoroalkenes.
