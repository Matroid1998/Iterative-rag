Text:
Lanthanide ions (Ln) possess unique photophysical and 
magnetic properties, finding application in magnetic1620 
and optical technologies, both at bulk and molecular 
scales.2124 While bulk systems offer scalability and high 
stability, molecular systems allow exquisite structural and 
electronic control, leading to extraordinarily effective 
molecules. Molecular design has produced record breaking 
molecular magnets and highly emissive complexes.1921 
Combining multiple, different Ln in a molecular species is 
desirable to design multimetallic systems for sensing, 
optics, and quantum information science.111, 25 However, 
the ionic bonding of Ln and their resultant chemical 
similarity makes selective synthesis of heteromultimetallic 
molecules challenging. Strategies that have been used to overcome the 
challenges of Ln heterobimetallic synthesis can be grouped 
into two broad categories thermodynamic and kinetic 
control.

Description:
Elements that form heterometallic complexes with selective coordination based on ionic radius differences.

Text:
Thermodynamic control involves ligands which 
use variation in ionic radius across the period to 
statistically assemble selective heterometallic complexes. Ln with large differences in ionic radius therefore 
selectively coordinate at different ligand sites. Early 
studies using this approach achieved high selectivity,26, 27 
and 
complete 
selectivity 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
paddlewheellike multimetallic systems (Figure 1a).9, 10 
Kinetic control uses ligands which form kinetically inert 
complexes under reaction conditions, with high binding 
constants (typically K  1012) so that redistribution is 
inaccessible.28 Individual kinetically inert complexes are 
then linked to construct multimetallic architectures (Figure

or (c) combined thermodynamic selectivity of kinetically inert 
moieties to an asymmetric bridging ligand (this work).
