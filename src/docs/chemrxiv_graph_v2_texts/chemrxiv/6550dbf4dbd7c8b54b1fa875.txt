Description:
Reacts with free radicals on polymer chains, initiating oxidative degradation.

Text:
This is because the long carbon chains of TPO or the long 
polyol part of TPU are sensitive to thermooxidative degradation, particularly when subjected 
to thermomechanical treatment with oxygen, light or heat, mainly during processing, but also 
during their lifetime (Goldberg and Zaikov, 1987). Oxidative degradation of polymers is 
initiated by the formation of free radicals on the polymer chain due to the breaking of carbon 
bonds. These free radicals then react with oxygen present in the air, initiating an autocatalyzed 
reaction that will ultimately generate chain breakdowns, resulting in a loss of polymer 
properties (Moss and Zweifel, 1989). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202391xf7 ORCID httpsorcid.org000000022797226X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
