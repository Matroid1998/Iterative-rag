Description:
A 1-hydroxy compound that can be activated for glycosylation.

Text:
of a latent 
leaving group at the anomeric position, which can be activated in 
the presence of a nucleophile acceptor to undergo the coupling 
step.4 A less explored strategy for glycosidic bond formation is the 
dehydrative coupling in which a 1hydroxy carbohydrate or 
hemiacetal can be activated directly to generate a highly reactive 
species to undergoe glycosylation in situ, thus potentially leading 
to a more efficient process.5 However, lack of control over the 
reversibility of the reaction, which in the absence of an excess of 
nucleophile can lead to incomplete reactions or hemiacetal donor 
dimerization via selfcoupling,6 has limited its broad utility.
