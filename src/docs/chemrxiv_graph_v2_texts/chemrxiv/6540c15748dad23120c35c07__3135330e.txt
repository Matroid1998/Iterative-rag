Description:
Can be oxidized with water vapor or used in flame synthesis to produce tungsten oxides.

Text:
The most frequently used 
method is based on the solvothermal reaction of WCl626,27 or W(CO)628,29 with aliphatic 
alcohols in an autoclave or just at elevated temperature in high boiling point solvents. This route 
results in uniform nanowhiskers of various lengths and thicknesses. Other possible preparation 
procedures involve controlled oxidation of metallic tungsten with water vapor23,30 or flame 
synthesis based on the deposition of tungsten oxides on various surfaces by heating a tungsten 
mesh with a hightemperature heater.31 Tungsten disulfide WS2 could also be used as a tungsten 
source for these nanofibers using the hightemperature, lowpressure reactor in the presence of 
water vapor.32 This study was conducted in a chamber of an electron microscope with a heating 
extension serving as a sample holder.

A similar study33 has been done based on the oxidation 
of tungsten filament to substoichiometric tungsten oxide whiskers with characterization and 
material properties testing performed entirely insitu in the electron microscope chamber. Electrospinning3436 is a versatile and accessible method for the production of submicron 
and nanoscopic fibers from organic polymers and inorganic compounds with a valuable 
extension to the industrial production of many highend materials and products. There are
