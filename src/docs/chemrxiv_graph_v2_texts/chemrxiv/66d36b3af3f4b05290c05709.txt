Albeit glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors, 
its treatment continues to challenge the medical community today.1,2 Each year, more than 250,000 
new cases occur worldwide, while 200,000 patients die from this cancer with an annual growth 
rate of 1.5.3 According to recent studies, the incidence has increased from 0.73 to 4.49 per 
100,000 people in the last 10 years worldwide.4 Despite having a lower incidence compared to 
other cancers such as lung, breast or prostate cancer, GBM has a survival rate of 1416 months and 
the fiveyear overall survival rate of less than 10.5 Novel therapeutically modalities are urgently 
needed. Figure 1. A) Schematic overview of the challenges in GBM treatment. B) Principle of ruthenium
based photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT).
