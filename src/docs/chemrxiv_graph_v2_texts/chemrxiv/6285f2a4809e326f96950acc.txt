Description:
Consumed by microbes during metabolism, affecting the pH of the environment.

On the other hand, some microbes are 
considered beneficial to inhibit corrosion in natural environments due to the barrier characteristics 
of the biofilms and their tendency to avoid cathodic depolarization 79. Mostly, due to the 
corrosion process, the dissolved ionic species could disturb the barrier characteristics of the EPS 
and the MIC is accelerated in the presence of microbial biofilms 1013. Microbiologically 
influenced corrosion inhibition (MICI) is important and is promoted by two types of mechanisms. In the first mechanism, corrosion inhibiting microbes can inactivate the corrosion causing 
microbes through metabolic activities. During their metabolism, they can either consume oxygen 
from the surrounding environment by varying the pH of the EPS, which can affect the biological
