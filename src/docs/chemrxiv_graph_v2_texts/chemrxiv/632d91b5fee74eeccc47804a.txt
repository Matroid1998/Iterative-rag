Description:
A strong oxidizer used in chemical oxidation processes.

Text:
PEDOTs and many other 
CPs are conventionally synthesized in large scale by either polycondensation reactions1923 that 
require high temperature stirring of the monomer (EDOT) in toxic solvents catalyzed by 
expensive transition metal catalysts (Ni (0), Pd (0)) under inert atmosphere or by chemical 
oxidation which is accomplished using excess amount of strong oxidizers like FeCl3, 
Fe(OT24s)3 and Na2S2O825, 26. This is in conflict with the concept of sustainable chemistry2729. In order to match the requirements of green chemistry and mitigate global warming, new 
straightforward methods that do not use additional input energy (thermalelectrical) or inert 
atmosphere and that can be performed in less toxic solvents are needed.
