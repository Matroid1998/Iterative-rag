Description:
A product of CO or CO2 hydrogenation using Cu-based catalysts.

Text:
This process can yield various products, ranging from CO, via the so
3 
called Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction,1, 2 to methane by the Sabatier reaction.3 It can also 
4 
yield intermediate compounds like methanol or even higher hydrocarbon or alcohol products via the 
5 
FischerTropsch process.47 However, the hydrogenation of CO2 towards valueadded chemicals like 
6 
methanol is notoriously more challenging when compared to the hydrogenation of CO, despite both 
7 
processes sharing common catalytically active materials, reaction conditions and similar reaction 
8 
mechanisms.8, 9 The most prominent example is the hydrogenation of CO or CO2 using Cubased 
9 
catalysts, which favor methanol synthesis via formate and methoxy intermediates, while hardly 
10 
producing methane under a wide range of conditions.10 Aiming at improving the catalytic performance, 
11 
large research efforts have been directed at identifying socalled promoters to improve product 
12 
selectivity.

Description:
Selectivity is enhanced by Zn and Ga in Cu-based catalysts.

Text:
In Cubased materials, Zn is wellknown to greatly enhance methanol selectivity.10, 11 Other 
13 
reducible elements, in particular Ga, have also been shown to enhance methanol selectivity of Cu
14 
based catalysts.1214 Additionally, Ga is able to switch the general reaction outcome.

Description:
Produced at low pressure in the presence of Ga and formed with exceptional activity by Pd and Pt with Ga.

Text:
For instance, Ni
15 
catalysts, which under CO2 hydrogenation conditions are very wellknown for their selectivity towards 
16 
methane, produce methanol at low pressure in the presence of Ga.1517 More recently, Ga was reported 
17 
to even switch the RWGS activity of noble metals like Pd and Pt to methanol formation with exceptional 
18 
activity.1821 Detailed investigations for the PdGa and PtGasystems using Surface Organometallic 
19 
Chemistry (SOMC) have shown that redox dynamics involving MGaGaOx (M  Pd or Pt) interfaces 
20 
are responsible for promoting methanol formation with high activity.20, 21 
21 
Considering the wellknown methanation activity of group 89 transition metals (Ru, Os, Rh, and 
22 
Ir), 2225 we thus reasoned, that it was worth exploring how Ga would affect the reactivity patterns and 
23 
the structure of these metals.
