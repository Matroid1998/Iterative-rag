Description:
Formed by the reaction of aldehydes, leading to limited control over composition and variability.

Text:
While some examples of synthetic telechelic systems can be 
found,22,2527 there remain remarkably few examples of watersoluble, biocompatible, synthetic 
polymers with pendent aldehyde groups.28,29 On the other hand, the facile chemical modification 
of natural biopolymers with aldehydes via oxidation makes them popular candidates for 
DCvC.9,10,23,24,30,31 However, their inherent heterogeneity, dispersity, and propensity to tieup 
aldehydes as hemiacetals,32 ultimately lead to limited control over composition and batchto
batch variability. In contrast, synthetic polymers can circumvent some of these drawbacks due to 
their welldefined chemical composition, molecular weight, and structural simplicity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024n9p8hv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000252893491 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
