Description:
A derivative of 8aminoquinoline used in the synthesis of potential therapeutic agents.

Text:
8Aminoquinoline (8AQ) and 8Hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) and their derivatives have found a 
great variety of applications in chemistry, from dyes to pharmaceuticals.1,2 8AQ has also found 
application as a precursor for the synthesis of new potential therapeutic agents such as N4
tetradentate copper ligands named TDMQ or bis8aminoquinoline derivatives38 
Drug discovery and development is a very complex process demanding the implementation of 
multiple tools to test biological activity and safety of use. For example, to predict the 
transformations of drugs in the human body, it is important to investigate the redox activity of 
these drugs and to find a correlation between oxidation and reduction processes and pH. Typically, 
voltammetric techniques can be used to track such changes in vitro (e.g.
