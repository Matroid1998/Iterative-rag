Description:
Molecules with relatively small size and reduced flexibility, studied for their ECD spectra.

Here 44,11, 33 linkages are
involved in the connection, and their ECD spectra have been ex
tensively investigated by the many experimental works.31,3335
Because of the relatively small molecular size and the reduced
flexibility, bisphenanthrenes have been the subject of many theo
retical works aimed at reproducing and interpreting experimental
ECD spectra.3337 In the previous calculations, single molecules
or the exciton coupling mode have been adopted. For example,
Harada et.al. have investigated biphenanthryl compounds and
suggested that the exciton model may yield ambiguous conclu
sions in certain chiral biphenanthryl systems, and simple qualita
tive predictions based on the exciton method may not be suitable
for 1,1biphenanthryl compounds.34 Jurinovich et.al.
