Description:
Used in photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes, with noble metal decoration enhancing light absorption and inhibiting electron-hole recombination.

Text:
Meeting both needs is nontrivial, and so far this challenge has 
limited the realworld implementation of TiO2based photocatalytic AOPs.5 
Partially decorating TiO2 particles with noble metals has been widely studied recently10
19 and is thought to aid in both increasing light absorption and inhibiting electronhole 
recombination to differing extents, depending on experimental conditions. The mechanism by 
which the metal coatings enhance photocatalysis is incompletely understood, but is known to be
