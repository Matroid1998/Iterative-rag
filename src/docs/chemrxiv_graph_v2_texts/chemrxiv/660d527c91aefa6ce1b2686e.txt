Description:
Readily available starting materials used in cycloaddition reactions with bicyclo1.1.0butanes.

Text:
Alternatively, an intermolecular cy
cloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs) and alkenes is 
highly desirable since it allows the efficient construction of 
bicyclic ring through the fusion of two readily available 
starting materials. Pioneering studies were disclosed by 
Blanchard5a in 1966 and De Meijere5b in 1986. Subsequently, 
Wipf group5c reported an intramolecular variant of this cy
cloaddition under thermal condition in 2006. More recently, by taking advantage of the ready availabil
ity and inherent ring strain of BCBs,6b,9 the exploration of 
new strategies to the cycloaddition between BCBs and al
kenes in the generation of various BCHs has attracted inten
sive attentions.68 According to the reported reaction pro
cesses, most methods could be categorized into two modes 
1) radical pathway; and 2) twoelectron pathway (Scheme 
1b).

Description:
Undergo cycloaddition with BCBs to form bicyclo2.1.1hexanes.

Text:
By utilizing the photoinduced energy transfer course, 
Glorius6a and Brown6b groups respectively described ele
gant cycloaddition of BCBs and alkenes toward bicy
clo2.1.1hexanes. The reaction was initiated by the excita
tion of either alkene or BCB to generate a diradical interme
diate. Li7a and Wang7c groups developed a borylpyridine 
catalytic system to activate BCB as a cyclobutyl radical in
termediate.
