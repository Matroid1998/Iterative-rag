Description:
Molecules with particularly strong and directional hydrogen bonding.

Text:
We proposed that such features might be used 
to predict the formation of other porous HOFs in the fu
ture. HOFs3034 are a subclass of porous solids whose structures 
are driven by hydrogen bonding, which is typically weaker 
than the directional coordination bonding in MOFs.35 
Hence, assumptions about crystal packing based on intui
tive rules are more prone to fail.3638 For example, even 
though the hydrogen bonding in the benzimidazalone 
molecules that we studied28 is particularly strong and di
rectional, there are at least four competing porous poly
morphs that are all defined by 1dimensional hydrogen
