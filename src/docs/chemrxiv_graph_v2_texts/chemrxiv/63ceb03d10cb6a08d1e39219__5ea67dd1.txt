Description:
Substrates used in the retroFavorskii reaction to obtain terminal alkynes.

Text:
The retroFavorskii reaction finds limited use in organic synthesis being performed in most cases 
to obtain terminal alkynes from propargyl alcohols.24 The reaction requires the use of a strong base, 
high temperature (usually reflux temperature of toluene or nbutanol), and usually needs several 
hours, thus limiting its scope and often resulting in side reactions and degradation of the 
substrates.5,6 
While most interest in the retroFavorskii is focused on the alkyne, in our group we are currently 
investigating the possibility of employing this approach to synthesize suitable precursors for the 
preparation of conjugated compounds bearing carbonyl and quinone functionalities.
