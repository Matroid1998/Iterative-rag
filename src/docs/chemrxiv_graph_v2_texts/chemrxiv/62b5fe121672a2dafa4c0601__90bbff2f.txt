Description:
Synthesized via Knoevenagel condensation and transesterification.

Text:
4Chloro ringsubstituted 1,1dimethylethyl PCA is mentioned in 
mechanistic studies of coppercatalyzed 1,4addition of organoboronates to alkylidene 
cyanoacetates 7, and in synthesis of (arylmethylene)cyano2alkenoic acid ethyl 
ester derivatives via Knoevenagel condensation of aryl aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid 
methyl ester and subsequent transesterification 8. 4Chloro ringsubstituted ethyl PCA 
is involved in synthesis of cycloheptabthiophene derivative incorporating pyrimidine, 
pyridine, and chromene moiety as potential antimicrobial agents targeting DNA gyrase 
9; in synthesis of new pyridine, chromene and thiazole containing compounds as 
antimicrobial and antioxidant agents 10; in synthesis, molecular docking and 
anticancer activity of some 5aryl5,10dihydropyrido2,3d6,5ddipyrimidine2,4,6,8
tetraone derivatives and pyrido2,3dpyrimidines 11; in antibacterial and anticancer 
profiling of new benzocaine derivatives 12; in design, synthesis, cytotoxic screening
