Description:
A reactant in hydrogenation processes to produce olefin intermediates and aromatics.

Text:
of toluene, the olefin intermediates generated in situ from CO2 hydrogenation over iron
23 
based catalysts were preferentially converted to aromatics of jet fuel by alkylation with toluene. Furthermore, 
24 
low carbon number olefins were more readily alkylated with toluene at the acidic site of the Z5 zeolite. More 
25 
significantly, the appropriate proximity of the two components of the tandem catalyst played a crucial role in 
26 
the continuous and synergistic catalytic conversion of CO2 into aromatics of jet fuel. This study provides a 
27 
viable technique for the highly selective synthesis of ecofriendly and carbonneutral aromatics of jet fuel from 
28 
CO2. 29
