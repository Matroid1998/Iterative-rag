Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which competes with CO2 reduction reactions.

The transformation of CO2 into valuable carbonbased fuels 
through reduction presents a sustainable approach to 
addressing 
global 
energy 
demands 
and 
reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.15 Efficient catalysts are 
necessary that can selectively perform CO2 reduction 
reactions 
(CO2RR) 
over 
the 
kinetically 
and 
thermodynamically 
competitive 
hydrogen 
evolution 
reaction (HER). Furthermore, selectivity is also desirable as 
CO2 reduction can lead to a variety of products in a fairly 
narrow range of potential (Scheme 1).67 Toward these 
goals, design and detailed study of homogeneous molecular 
catalysts is of particular relevance, as it may present us with 
an opportunity to understand the individual electron and 
proton transfer steps involved in the complex multielectron 
redox transformations required to convert CO2 to value 
added products.
