Description:
Have solute descriptors determined by Goss et al.

Text:
The lowercase letters are referred to 
as system parameters, are calibrated by leastsquares multiple 
linear regression (MLR) with typically 50 or more calibration data, 
and reflect the complementary interaction properties of the two 
phases. The terms with S, A, and B describe the polar 
interactions, while those with V and L describe the nonspecific 
cavity formation and nonpolar interactions. The PPLFERs can conveniently predict a variety of partition 
coefficients for a given compound. While solute descriptors are 
available for several thousand compounds,10 they are rarely 
available for PFAS. In the past, Goss et al.11 determined solute 
descriptors for four fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and four 
fluorotelomer olefins (FTOs).
