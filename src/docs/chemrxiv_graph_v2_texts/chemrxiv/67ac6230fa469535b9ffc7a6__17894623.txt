Description:
Can react with reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of a potent oxidant species.

Text:
These species react rapidly and unselectively with organic compounds to form 
reactive intermediates, which is difficult to measure.14 Elementary reactionbased 
mathematical models that integrate the kinetics of each chemical reaction with reaction 
pathways, and the numerical solutions of their related ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs), can predict the timedependent distribution of starting materials and reactive 
intermediates.15 However, to precisely predict the yield of each species at a given time, the 
reaction rate of each elementary reaction should be known before calculating the numerical 
solution. In the previous work16, we showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by 
radiolysis of water can react with dissolved organochlorides, leading to the formation of a 
potent oxidant species.
