Description:
Functional group involved in arylation protocols with arynes.

Text:
However, no exclusive arynebased O
arylation has ever been described in the synthesis of 
organophosphorous compounds. More generally, there are 
limited examples of Oarylation transformations6 using arynes 
(scheme 1, B), overall restricted to few hydroxyl and carboxyl
group arylation protocols since 2004.3032 
Despite the many studies scrutinizing the reactivity of diverse 
arynophiles, the ability of phosphates to engage in reactions with 
arynes is absent from the literature. This is remarkable, as the 
urgent need to access probes for interrogation of phosphate 
functions, e.g. in analytical biochemistry, has driven innovative 
synthesis strategy development in the past years. 3337
