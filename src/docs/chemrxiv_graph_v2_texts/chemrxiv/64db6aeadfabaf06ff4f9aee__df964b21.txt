Description:
A high-pressure polymorph of SiO2.

Extreme pressuretemperature conditions are a powerful tool for creating nanostructured materials.17 
Such materials are not only interesting for the fundamental understanding of microscopic phenomena 
due to nanostructuring (mechanical and transport properties, etc. ), but also have great potential for 
advanced applications as wide bandgap semiconductors. In traditional experimental approaches, the 
recovery of highpressure phases (diamond, stishovite, rsZnO, etc.) is linked to the timepressure
temperature (tpT) synthesis protocol (e.g. rate of decompressioncooling from pT synthesis 
conditions, decompression temperature, etc.) and the initial state of the precursors (e.g. grain size, 
impurities). For example, nanocrystalline stishovite (highpressure polymorph of SiO2) and rsZnO can 
be quenched down to ambient conditions starting from periodic mesoporous silica3 and nanopowders 
of wurtzite ZnO,4 respectively.
