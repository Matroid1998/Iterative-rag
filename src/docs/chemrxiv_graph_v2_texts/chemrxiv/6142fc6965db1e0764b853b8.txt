Description:
Can be sp2 hybridized and form cyclic structures in chemical reactions.

Text:
For example, a reaction is discarded if there is not an exact
onetoone mapping between the heavy atoms of the reactant and the product excluding
the reacting bromine(s), or if a reacting bromine forms a bond to something other than a
cyclic sp2 hybridized carbon atom (accounting for 5,314 reactions). Furthermore, reactions
with unique reactions IDs in Reaxys but identical reactants are merged (accounting for 3,158
reactions). Quantum chemical calculations
Recently, we published the RegioSQM20 method,6 which predicts the regioselectivities of
EAS reactions from semiempirical calculations of proton anities. The singletautomer
