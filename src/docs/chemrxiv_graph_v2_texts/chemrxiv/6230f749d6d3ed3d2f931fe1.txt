Description:
Derived from fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, most commonly via the steam reforming process.

Text:
Processes which utilize watersplitting derived hydrogen and traditional HaberBosch 
reactors report ammonia costs of 0.81.2 kg NH3,1821 though there are reports of ammonia costs 
in the 0.40.6 kg NH3 as well.22 However, there are several drawbacks to these processes that 
could make a fully electrical ammonia production approach attractive. HaberBosch ammonia is synthesized by reacting nitrogen and hydrogen at high 
temperature and pressure in large, centralized plants.4 Typically, the hydrogen is derived from 
fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, most commonly via the steam reforming process.

Description:
Used in ammonia production, contributing to significant carbon dioxide emissions when derived from fossil fuels.

Text:
Utilizing 
fossil fuels for hydrogen production as well as thermal energy results in significant carbon dioxide 
emissions, ranging from a theoretical minimum of 1.8 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for natural gas23, to 
around 3.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for coal;21,24 the global average CO2 emissions are approximately 
2.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3.23 As a result of tremendous worldwide demand driven primarily by the 
fertilizer and chemicals industry, HaberBosch ammonia produced from fossilfuel derived 
hydrogen accounts for approximately 1.5 of worldwide CO2 emissions.23 If transportation fuels 
are to comprise another source of demand for ammonia, it is critical to mitigate the carbon footprint 
associated with current methods of ammonia production.

Description:
Produced from water electrolysis using renewable energy for decarbonization.

Text:
The most conceptually straightforward 
route for decarbonization is to use hydrogen produced from water electrolysis using renewable 
energy as a feedstock to the HaberBosch process. This approach is appealing due to the declining 
costs of water electrolyzer technology,25 and has seen growing interest in the academic
