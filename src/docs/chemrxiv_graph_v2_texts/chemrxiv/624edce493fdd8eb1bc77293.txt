Description:
Used as a catalysing moiety in the amination of saturated hydrocarbons.

Text:
Electrons can be added to electrondeficient functional groups to convert them into 
nucleophiles, or removed from electronrich functional groups to convert them into 
electrophiles. Thus, these reactions are interesting because their availability creates the 
potential to develop entirely new synthetic strategies for the construction of more complex 
molecules, being able to be framed in the green chemistry. The HofmannLffler reaction is an example of C(sp3)H bonds functionalization that 
proceeds via generation of remote intramolecular free radical intermediate. In this reaction, 
cyclic amine is formed via decomposition of Nhalogenated amine under strongly acidic, 
thermal and photochemical conditions.13 In 2015, Martnez et al14 reported amination of 
saturated hydrocarbons using Hypervalent iodine as a catalysing moiety.

Description:
Catalyzes radical chain reactions within various oxidation states.

Text:
During the iodine 
catalysis, radical chain is formed that works within the various oxidation states of iodine (IIII). This method is an efficient and provide alternative to the conventional metalcatalyzed 
transformations. However, OBroin et al in 2016,15 presented an efficient method for the 
intramolecular C(sp3)H bonds amination of aliphatic compounds in the presence of N
Iodosuccinimide (NIS) as a promoter. Light was used as source for activation of promotor. This
