Description:
Cubic boron nitride (cBN) has a Vickers hardness of 55 GPa.

The automotive, aerospace, defense, and health care industries, among others, depend on
materials with enhanced hardness.1 Eorts to discover superhard materials, with a Vickers
hardness (HV ) 40GPa, have largely relied upon simple design rules and trialanderror
approaches.2 Accordingly, attempts to mimic the structural and mechanical properties of
diamond (HV 90 100GPa), the prototypical superhard material, have manipulated
light, main group elements to achieve the desired strong, dense 3D network of short covalent
bonds.36 Cubic boron nitride (cBN, HV  55 GPa) and BC2N (HV  65 GPa) are examples
of this type.79 However, the synthesis of diamond and other hard materials in its class
is often costprohibitive, requiring extreme temperatures and pressures.2 To combat the
exorbitant synthetic costs, researchers have directed focus towards another class of hard
materials transition metal (TM ) borides such as ReB2 (HV  45 GPa) and WB4 (HV 
43 GPa).10,11 Integration of the TM s simplies material synthesis because conventional arc
melting processes can yield the desired structures.
