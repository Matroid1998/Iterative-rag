Description:
Links to nitrogen to form cyctryptomycin A and B.

Text:
The key re
actions in this synthetic pathway are the linking of C22 and C18 
by macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A (3) and the linking of 
the nitrogen on the indole to C18 to form cyctryptomycin A and 
B (12). We first attempted to synthesize cyctryptomycin A and 
B (12) by oxidative cyclization of tetratryptomycin A (3) as an 
initial screening (Figure 1B).11 More than 100 oxidation condi
tions were applied, including NCS, NBS, NIS, PhI(OAc)2, 
PhI(OCOCF3)2, FeCl3, V2O5, Mn(OAc)3, anodic oxidation,
