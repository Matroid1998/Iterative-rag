Description:
A furanic derivative identified as a biomass molecule suitable for use as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals.

Additionally, aqueous reforming methods for nongaseous biomass feedstock products 
often require costly separation methods to achieve high purity products.612 
Electrochemistry is another possible approach, as it is amenable to aqueous, acidic 
conditions and offers some other potential advantages over traditional thermal catalysis; 
these include the ability to generate oxidative and reducing equivalents in situ, not 
needing to alkalize or otherwise treat the aqueous feedstock to adjust pH, as well as 
operating at ambient pressures and temperatures.1316 
Furanic derivatives, such as furfural and 5hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), have 
been identified as biomass molecules suitable to be used as a feedstock for a variety of 
fuels and chemicals.
