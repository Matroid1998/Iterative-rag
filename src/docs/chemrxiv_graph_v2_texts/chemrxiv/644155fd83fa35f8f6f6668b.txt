Description:
Inhibits the bioreduction of hypoxia-activated prodrugs in cells, preventing the release of the effector compound.

Text:
Hypoxia (insufficient oxygen) is a common feature of the tumor microenvironment resulting from 
uncontrolled cell proliferation and aberrant vasculature. Clinically, hypoxia is associated with therapy 
resistance, metastasis, and poor patient prognosis.1 Therefore, there is an unmet need to reverse 
tumor hypoxia andor develop strategies to target chemotherapies to hypoxic tumor regions.2,3 One 
such strategy is hypoxiaactivated prodrugs (HAPs), which are selectively activated in hypoxia and 
target drug release to hypoxic regions of tumors while sparing healthy oxygenated tissues.4 When 
present in cells, oxygen inhibits the bioreduction of HAPs that is mediated by endogenous 
oxidoreductases, and prevents the fragmentation and release of the effector compound. When 
oxygen is sparse, HAPs undergo enzymaticallycatalyzed bioreduction, which is enhanced by 
endogenous reductases being upregulated in response to hypoxia in cells.5,6
