Description:
A class of transition metal complexes with a large 5d ion encapsulated by a sterically constrained, macrocyclic corrole ligand.

The last decade has witnessed the emergence of a unique class of transition metal complexes 
 the 5d metallocorroles.1 Their uniqueness derives from their sizemismatched nature, which 
involves a large 5d ion encapsulated by a sterically constrained, macrocyclic corrole 
ligand.2,3,4 In spite of the steric strain inherent in their structures, the middle and late 5d 
transition metal (Re,5,6,7,8,9 Os,10,11,12 Ir,13 Pt,14,15 and Au16,17,1819,20,21,22,23) corroles have proved 
thermally and photochemically rugged.
