Description:
A membrane material used in sample slide preparation for experiments.

Text:
b) Stepbystep visualization of sample slide preparation, from adding the doublesided 
tape to the glass slide (slide 2), affixing the nylon membrane (slide 3), scoring the nylon to make 
sample wells (slide 4) and spotting the nylon with sample (slide 5). c) Image of the Prosolia

sprayer head over the nylon membrane as an experiment was being recorded. Relative 
positioning of the sprayer head (70o angle) and ion inlet (1mm from slide surface) can be used as 
a starting point for stage parameters when a new user is establishing their setup. d) Schematic 
of the protonation event that occurs on the sample slide, in positive ion mode.
