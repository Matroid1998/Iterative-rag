Zmatrix templatebased substitution approach 
Three dimensional molecular structures are often represented by a Zmatrix or Cartesian 
40 
coordinates. The two representations can easily be interconverted by freely available software. We 
use Zmatrix for convenience as bond lengths, bond angles and torsional angles, which are natural 
quantities for chemists, can be explicitly laid out. (Cartesian coordinates would be very difficult to 
manipulate using this templatebased substitution method.) As mentioned earlier, templates and 
substitution sites must be identified manually by human. For simplicity, in this article, we use 
45 
hydrogen and halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) as substitutions. The substitution approach can help 
us explore structures of different chemical compositions and structures of identical chemical formula 
(constitutional, configurational and conformational isomers) at the same time.

Description:
An element that can substitute hydrogen atoms in benzene to form halo substituted benzenes.

Text:
The example shown in Figure 1 is a template for the generation of halo
substituted benzenes. The six halogen atom substitution sites are labelled as a, b, c, d, e and f. This 
template can be manually constructed by hand from scratch or by editing a Zmatrix from a molecular 
60 
graphic software such as IQmol. For complicated molecules, it would be easier to draw or import the 
structure in such a program before manual manipulation. IQmol can help us visually identify the 
atom numbers corresponding to desired substitution sites by using Display  Atom Labels  Index.
