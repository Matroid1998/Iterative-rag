Description:
A unit that composes the biopolymer chitin, extracted from biomass waste streams.

Text:
Chitin is a biopolymer composed of Nacetylglucosamine units, which can 
be extracted from various biomass waste streams including crustaceans, cephalopods, insects, 
and fungus in large scale annually.1 It is the second most abundant biopolymer after cellulose 
and as such, constitutes the core component of the shellbiorefinery,2 as a part of blue
biorefinery. Chitosan, as the deacetylated version of chitin, is a linear polysaccharide with amine 
functionality.3 Chitosan features unique and attractive properties such as antimicrobial ability,4, 5 
biocompatibility,6 and biodegradability,7 applicable to many fields including biomedicine,8 
food,9 agriculture,10 cosmetics,11 and water treatment.12 Chitosan properties are largely 
dependent upon two features its degree of deacetylation (DDA) and Mw.1315 Control over Mw 
is desirable as it can have considerable influence on the performance of the material in different 
applications.
