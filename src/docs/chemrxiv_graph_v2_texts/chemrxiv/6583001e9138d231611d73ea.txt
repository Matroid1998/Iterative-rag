Description:
Nonheme iron halogenases selectively halogenate the substrate.

Text:
For example, nonheme iron 
halogenases selectively halogenate the substrate even though they also have the potential to carry 
out hydroxylation.42 Prior experimental studies supported with computations suggested that 
substrate positioning43 and reactivity of the rebound intermediate44,45 could explain the observed 
selectivity. Furthermore, computational studies have rationalized the selectivity of these enzymes 
through various hypotheses including substrate positioning46,47 using spectroscopic indicators 
derived from hyperfine sublevel correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy,4850 isomerization of 
metaloxohydroxo intermediates,51,52 interactions with the second coordination sphere,53 frontier 
molecular orbital energetics,54 and OH trapping either through protonation of hydroxo55 or 
bicarbonate formation.56 A recent computational study57 further demonstrated that the selectivity 
of halogenases depends on the nature of the substrate radical, with halogen transfer favored for 
secondary carbon radicals and hydroxo transfer preferred for tertiary carbon radicals.
