Description:
The openshell occupation of Pu in PuO2 remains nopen 4, which is critical to understand the multiplet structures in spectroscopic measurements.

Text:
Donation of electrons by the ligands creates an effective 5f occupation nf  4 when
the openshell occupation of Pu in PuO2 remains nopen  4. The distinction between the
integer openshell occupation nopen and the effective total 5f occupation nf is important,
because both are associated with different physical and chemical properties. The openshell occupation nopen is critical to understand the multiplet structures
that arise in spectroscopic measurements. For instance, the symmetries of the ground
