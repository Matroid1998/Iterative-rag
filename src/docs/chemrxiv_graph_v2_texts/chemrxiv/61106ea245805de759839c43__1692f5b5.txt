Description:
Widely used as ligands for organometallic complexes, notably in Brookhart-type catalysts for olefin polymerization.

Diimines (1,4diaza1,3dienes) are widely used as 
ligands for organometallic complexes,12 perhaps most 
notably 
in 
Brookharttype 
catalysts 
for 
olefin 
polymerization.35 The diimine ligand scaffold has proven 
to be remarkably versatile due to its facile stereoelectronic 
tunability.69 For example, modifications to the backbone and 
Naryl substituents of diimines can exert control over the 
molecular weight and microstructure of olefin polymers by 
attenuation of chain walking processes.1, 10 Diimine ligands 
are also often redox noninnocent, which allows for richer 
and more complex redox processes.1114 Diimines are also 
precursors 
to 
valuable 
chiral 
1,2diamines 
through 
asymmetric hydrogenation,1516 or to Nheterocyclic carbene 
(NHC) ligands through cyclization with paraformaldehyde 
and subsequent deprotonation.1720 
Typically, 
diimines 
are 
synthesized 
through 
condensation of diketones and amines.

Description:
Compounds that are synthetically challenging to access unsymmetrically due to poor chemoselectivity.

Text:
Despite the 
apparent 
simplicity 
of 
this 
approach, 
accessing 
unsymmetrical diimines through stepwise condensations is 
synthetically challenging due to poor chemoselectivity.21 
Furthermore, since imine formation is reversible, attempts at 
sequential selective condensations can result in complex 
mixtures (for example, see Figure 1A, Figures S93S96). Imines are also notoriously difficult to isolate because they 
are prone to hydrolysis, making methods that generate 
product mixtures impractical. Highlighting this problem, 
although amine condensation with glyoxal to afford 
diimines is a common route to symmetric NHCs there remain 
no examples of unsymmetric NHCs synthesized via 
condensation with glyoxal.22

diimine synthesis.
