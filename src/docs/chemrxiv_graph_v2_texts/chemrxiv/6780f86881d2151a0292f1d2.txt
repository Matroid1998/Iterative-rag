Description:
A chemotherapeutic drug known to induce oxidative stress, especially in cardiac tissues, and is limited by dose-dependent and cumulative cardiotoxicity.

Text:
In the context of cardiovascular conditions, oxidative stress plays a central role in the 
development of numerous conditions, such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and heart 
failure 6. The accumulation of ROS not only damages cardiac cells directly but also triggers a 
cascade of inflammatory responses 7. In cardiovascular disease conditions, ROS can be 
induced by various external and internal factors such as environmental toxins, radiation, 
inflammation, and certain medications like chemotherapeutic drugs 8. Among these, 
chemotherapy agents like doxorubicin (DOX) are wellknown inducers of oxidative stress, 
especially in cardiac tissues 9. Although, DOX is a highly effective antitumor agent used for 
treating various malignancies; however, its clinical application is limited by its dosedependent 
and cumulative cardiotoxicity, often called the Red Demon 10.
