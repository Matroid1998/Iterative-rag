A group of indole alkaloids recently isolated from Rauvolfia vomitoria.

Text:
The rauvomines (17) are a group of indole alkaloids recently isolated from Rauvolfia vomitoria, a small tree used 
in various traditional medicines which has proven to be a rich source of monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs).1,2 
Structurally, rauvomines AG fall into the sarpagine class of MIAs (exemplified by 8) but contain certain features that 
render them unique among this family.3 For instance, while all rauvomines incorporate an additional C19 methylbearing 
stereocenter found in a smaller subset of the class,4 rauvomines A (1) and C (3) contain an alkyl chloride, an uncommon 
motif for terrestrial indole alkaloids.5 Rauvomine B (2) is more unique still, with its proposed structure featuring a 
cyclopropane ring bridging its indoloquinolizidine unit, formed via an additional CC bond between C16 and C20 in the 
typical sarpagine scaffold.
