Description:
Natural compounds investigated as potential inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2.

Additionally, an in silico attempt has been reported to find inhibitors of main protease (MPro) by taking 
only six alkaloids from Vasaka tree (16). In this study, we have done a detailed computational investigation on natural quinazoline 
alkaloids by constructing an adequate library of 41 samples from two natural product databases in the 
search for potential inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARSCoV2. After two rounds of 
screenings based on rigid docking, flexible docking and ADMET profiling, we identified three 
quinazoline alkaloids as promising hit compounds. Furthermore, the stereoelectronic features of hit 
alkaloids were further investigated through additional structurebased Epharmacophore mapping and 
DFT based calculations.
