Common intermediates employed in the syntheses of complex molecules.

Text:
Onium ylides15, including sulfur6ad, oxonium7 and ammonium,8a,b are common 
intermediates employed in the syntheses of complex molecules. They are typically generated from 
the reaction of a heteroatom with a metalsupported carbene to furnish reactive zwitterionic 
intermediates that engage in a diverse set of reaction pathways, including 1,2Stevens 
rearrangements,8b 2,3sigmatropic rearrangements,9 and NH insertion reactions (Scheme 1A).3 
The aziridinium ylides10 represent a unique subclass of ammonium ylides whose reactivity is both 
poorly understood and underexplored, despite the potential for these reactive species to serve as 
key intermediates in the transformation of simple precursors to densely functionalized, 
stereochemically rich Nheterocycles.
