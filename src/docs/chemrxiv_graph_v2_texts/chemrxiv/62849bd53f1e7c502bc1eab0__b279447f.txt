Description:
A system where (111) and (220) planes exhibit the lowest surface energies, influencing crystal growth directions.

As in other anisotropic polycrystalline materials, the physical and chemical properties of SiC 
coatings are dependent on the growth orientation of the crystals, which is the result of 
competition between different growth planes. In the 3CSiC system, (111) and (220) planes 
were reported to exhibit the lowest surface energies24, meaning that under regular 
circumstances the SiC crystals would growth favorably in both 111 and 110 directions. Several studies have been performed to deposit highly oriented 3CSiC by tuning the 
deposition conditions or by utilizing different CVD techniques. Tu et al. have reported the 
growth of primarily 110oriented SiC at T  1450  and Ptot  10 kPa by thermal CVD25, 
whereas both primarily 110 and 111oriented SiC coatings were prepared at various 
conditions by Zhang et al. via laser CVD8.
