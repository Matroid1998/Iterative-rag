Description:
Characterized by different stacking modes using 13C ssNMR.

In 2017, Fan et al.17 confirmed
that SIOCCOF8 and SIOCCOF9 stack in an inclined ar
rangement using a combination of powder XRD, poresize
distribution analysis, and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis. In 2022, Kang et al.11 used 13C solidstate
nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) to study the chemical
environment of atoms in adjacent layers of 2D COFs and
reported that different stacking modes can be quantitatively
characterized by the split signals of the methoxymethyl side
groups. In the same year, Natraj et al.10 employed continu
ous rotation electron diffraction and XRD to demonstrate that
TAPPyPDA and TAPBDMPDA COFs are disordered along
the stacking c direction while remaining ordered within the ab
plane.
