Description:
Transferred from amino acids to ketoacids in a transamination reaction.

Text:
Over myriads of years of evolution, nature has developed intricate enzyme catalysts, 
accomplishing the transfer of aminonitrogen from amino acids to ketoacids to produce their 
corresponding aminoacids. This double displacement reaction may also be called a 
transamination metathesis reaction, whereby two compound reactants AB and CD result in 
products of AC and BD. In an attempt to follow natures efficient examples, chemists have 
developed few biomimetic methods for transamination metathesis of C(sp2)N bonds in the 
laboratory. The ever increasing practical importance of carbonheteroatom bond metathesis 
reactions is underlined also by recent exciting examples of C(sp2)S and C(sp2)P bond metathesis 
processes (1) (Fig. 1A). Existing rare examples of C(sp2)N bond metathesis include secondary amide transamidation 
reactions (2, 3) catalytic transamination of guanidines (4) and transamination of 
dimethylaminomethyleneoxindoles (5).
