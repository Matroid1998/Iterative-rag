Description:
Involved in the activation of the CO bond in noncyclic ethers.

Text:
Remarkably, 
this motif extended the scope of FLPtype reactivity to the activation of 
the CO bond in noncyclic ethers and even the activation of CF and C
Cl bonds in aryl halides.17 Since these initial reports, a variety of cationic 
group 4 TMFLPs have been reported by the groups of Erker, Le Gendre, 
Stephan, Beckhaus and others.1828 Most of these TMFLPs share a 
common element solidstate structures that display long bond 
distances between P and a cationic metal centre, which is supported by 
electrondonating auxiliary ligands (often Cpderived).
