Description:
A molecule whose intracellular levels are tracked using fluorescent probes.

Text:
Molecular imaging based on fluorescent probes is assumed to be a sensitive technique providing 
online fluorescence sensing of GSH. Although these probes have made great progress, there are 
still a number of challenges, including water solubility and aggregationcaused quenching (ACQ), 
which limits the longterm tracking of the intracellular GSH levels8,9. Due to the limitations of 
fluorescent probes, most of the reported works related to the recognition of intraocular GSH 
concentration are based on qualitative evaluation, and longterm tracking of intracellular GSH 
level has not been considered in these studies.
