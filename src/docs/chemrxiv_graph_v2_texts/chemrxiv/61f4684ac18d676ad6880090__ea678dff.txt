Description:
Cations used as catalysts in hydroboration of alkynes.

Text:
Hydroboration of terminal and internal alkynes has been also successful using transition metalfree, 
boroncontaining 
catalysts 
(e.g. B(C6F5)3, 
borenium 
cations, 
HB(C6F5)2, 
tris3,5
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylborane, tris(2,4,6trifluorophenyl)borane, H3BTHF) 5,6,7,8,9,10
