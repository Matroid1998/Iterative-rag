Description:
A parasitic product of the hydrogen evolution reaction in electrochemical processes.

Text:
Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2R) is such 
65 
a technology, offering a means to store energy from intermittent renewable sources in the form of 
66 
chemical bonds and to produce carbonneutral fuels and chemicals.1,2 Despite significant research 
67 
efforts aimed at increasing the activity of (electro)catalysts for forming valuable products such as 
68 
carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethylene, and ethanol while limiting selectivity to the parasitic hydrogen 
69 
evolution reaction (HER), further advances are needed.3,4

Beyond modifying the composition and structure of catalytic active sites, it is now clear that changes 
72 
to the environment in which the reaction occurs including the local pH, selection of electrolyte ions, 
73 
and solvent  result in significant differences in measured (electro)catalytic activity.511 For CO2R, the 
74 
magnitude of rate enhancements observed by changing electrolyte composition is as large as those 
75 
achieved through active site modification.12 Significant work has been done to describe the physical 
76 
phenomena behind these electrolyte effects in aqueous media.
