Description:
A cationic adjuvant formulation containing MMG, DDA, and the TLR3 agonist poly(IC).

Moreover, using a
synthetic MMG analog as an alternative to the naturally occurring MMG in vaccines has
several benefits, including more simple and scalable synthesis, higher purity, and, in many
cases, lower toxicity.3 Various MMGanalogcontaining vaccine adjuvant formulations have
been studied, including MMGdimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) liposomes2,3 combined
with Tolllike receptor (TLR) agonists,4 phytantriolMMG hexosomes,5 and an oilinwater
nanoemulsion.6 The most recent studies have focused on the further development of cationic
adjuvant formulation 09 (CAF09), which contains MMG, DDA, and the TLR3 agonist
poly(IC).79 The CAF09 formulation contains a specific C32 MMG analog, MMG1, which
displays a lipid acid stereochemistry that deviates from the native structure.
