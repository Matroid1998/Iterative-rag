Description:
A hydrolytically stable metal-organic framework used in drug delivery.

Text:
Over the preceding two decades, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed 
for a number of industrial applications in catalysis,12 and separations35 and have more recently 
emerged as promising materials for biological sensing6 and drug delivery.79 The applications for 
drug delivery have run from proposed systematic delivery of small molecules to the slow release 
of proteins in vivo.1011 A significant number of these MOFs in drug delivery have focused on two 
hydrolytically stable systems based on either zeolitic imidazole framework8 (ZIF8),89, 12 a
