Although 
photocatalytic H2O2 peroxide production from pure water and oxygen has been 
reported, the reaction rates were usually too low to accumulate high concentrations of 
the product,48 making the presence of additional electron donors like aliphatic or 
aromatic alcohols practically indispensable to achieve reasonable reaction rates.911 
Notably, this approach appears even more attractive if also the oxidation product of 
this reaction has a higher value than the substrate, as it is the case for the conversion 
of biomassderived feedstock.1113 
Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) whose photocatalytic activity was first reported by 
Wang et al.14 are known for their excellent performance in lightdriven H2O2 production 
from oxygen.15 The ionic form of this material comprising stacks of 2D heptazinebased 
networks and alkali metal cations andor protons, poly(heptazine imide) (PHI),13, 1626 
otherwise known as CNxNCN, KSCN or alkali metal modified carbon nitride, typically 
outperforms the conventional, nonionic, melon polymer in this reaction.10, 27 The 
superior activity of PHI can be explained, among other factors, by partial substitution 
of the terminal NH2groups for NCN species in PHI, resulting in fewer hydrogen 
bond interactions and better dispersibility of the material in polar solvents.28 A major 
challenge in carrying out such reactions in suspension is the effective separation of the 
dissolved reduction and oxidation products for their subsequent use, in order to avoid 
the decomposition of H2O2 on the surface of the photocatalyst by photoredox 
decomposition or by its disproportionation in the dark.
