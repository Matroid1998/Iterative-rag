Description:
Nanosheets synthesized through colloidal methods, with challenges in achieving well-dispersed and size-controlled forms.

Colloidal synthesis of TMDCs could be a 
promising strategy to produce a scalable amount of nanosheets by modifying the experimental parameters.19 It 
has been almost one decade since the first colloidal synthesis of WS2 nanosheets was developed, yet this field 
suffers from the lack of a direct colloidal protocols to produce both welldispersed and size controlled WS2 
nanosheets. Previous work from our group reported a protocol to produce 1TWS2 nanosheets, and by a 
modification, 2HWS2 nanoflowers were also synthesized.20 However, these 1TWS2 nanosheets were severely 
defected. Zhou et al. developed another hot injection protocol to synthesize WS2 nanosheets. Although they 
managed to control the number of layers by reinjection of the precursors, the nanosheets were not welldispersed
