Description:
A compound that can be reduced electrochemically into fuels and important chemicals.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R) has attracted a wide amount of attention 
as a potential means to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by converting CO2 into fuels and societally 
important chemicals.1,2 In particular, this technology has the potential to contribute to a closed 
carbon cycle when powered by lowcarbon renewable energy sources.3,4 Amongst key challenges 
in advancing CO2R systems towards practical use is the development of nonprecious metal 
catalysts that can selectively reduce CO2 into a single desired fuel and integrating them into a 
functional device.5,6 
Molecular catalysts have long been studied as model systems for extracting important 
structureactivity relationships in CO2R because binding site, functional ligands and reaction 
environment can all be precisely defined.7,8 This offers particular advantages over heterogeneous 
catalysts which often have a diversity of possible active sites in generating fundamental insights 
that can later be translated to functional systems.
