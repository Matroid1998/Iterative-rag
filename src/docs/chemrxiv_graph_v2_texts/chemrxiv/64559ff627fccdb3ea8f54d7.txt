Description:
A stable isotope of hydrogen used in isotope-labeled compounds for various applications in biomedical and material fields.

Text:
Deuteriumlabelled compounds consist of an important class of stable isotopelabelled chemicals, which have 
received a bunch of attention from both academic and industrial communities. Due to deuteriums 
interchangeability with protium (1H) and doubled mass, the labelled compounds have found multiple applications 
in biomedical and material fields,1 such as monitoring the metabolism of bioactive compounds,2 adjusting the 
pharmacokinetics of drugs,3 elucidating the mechanism of chemical transformations,4 and improving the lifetime 
of OLED devices.5 
Among the deuteration strategy developed,6 hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is a unique route for labelling,7 in 
which the protium at its original position was replaced by deuterium directly. This translation of hydrogens is
