Description:
Compounds with a hydroxyl functional group directly attached to an sp2 hybridized carbon atom of a phenyl group.

Text:
Phenols are compounds with a hydroxyl functional group directly attached to a 
sp2hybridized carbon atom of a phenyl group. Namely, they are compounds containing 
one or more hydroxyl groups attached to benzene or another arene ring 1. Many manufactured products such as dyes and oils, among others, have in their 
composition phenolic compounds that are of natural origin 2. They are present in 
vegetables in free form or linked to sugars (glycosides) and proteins 3. These 
compounds also lead to the polymerization of natural polyphenols such as lignin and 
melanin, besides forming an important class of antioxidants, which inhibit the oxidative 
degradation of organic or bioorganic molecules 2,4,5.

Description:
Compounds that react with radicals more quickly than other organic substrates.

Text:
The antioxidant activity of 
phenols against free radicals comes from their elimination role, which is related to their 
ability to react with radicals much more quickly than other organic substrates. For 
example, tocopherol (vitamin E) is mentioned as an efficient capture agent that can 
eliminate harmful peroxide radicals in the blood plasma 5,6. Protonation and deprotonation processes in aromatic molecules such as phenols 
are important in organic chemistry and biochemistry 7. Through the deprotonation of 
phenol, the phenoxide or phenolate ion is formed, stabilized by resonance. In comparison 
with phenol, the phenoxide ion is more stable because of the high displacement of the
