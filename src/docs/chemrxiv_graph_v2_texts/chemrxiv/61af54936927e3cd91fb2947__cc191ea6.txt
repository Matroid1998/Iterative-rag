Description:
A cheap reagent used without further preparation as an environmentally friendly alternative.

Text:
Compared with traditional nucleophilic substitutions by using HCN or 
metal cyanides811 as well as recent popular oximationdehydration strategy12 with the prepared reagents13 or 
additional alkali1415 we designed an environmentally friendly alternative using triphosgene. This reagent is cheap 
and used without further preparation. In a recent report,16 the reaction site of oxime was used in the chemical detection of phosgene. Since then many 
researchers reported the synthesis of nitriles or amides from various oximes with phosgene or its substitutes 
(triphosgene and diphosgene). But most of these applications suffer from the effect of toxic phosgene overflow at 
alkaline conditions (such as adding TEA in the reaction system) and narrow substrate scope.

Description:
A nonvolatile substitute for phosgene widely used in chemical synthesis.

Text:
Phosgene and its 
substitutes are important industrial feedstocks used in the productions of polyurethanes, polycarbonates, 
pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and aniline dyes.1718 On the other hand, phosgene, and diphosgene are highly toxic 
lung irritation effects even at low conversions, for which have been used as chemical warfare agents (CWAs) during 
World War I and World War II.19 As a substitute for phosgene, triphosgene is nonvolatile, and widely used in 
chemical synthesis.
