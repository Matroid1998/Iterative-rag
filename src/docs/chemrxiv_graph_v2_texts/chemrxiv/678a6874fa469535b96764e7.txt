Description:
A relatively new class of pesticides that have become the most widely used insecticides worldwide.

Pesticides are substances extensively applied in agriculture to control pests, diseases, and weeds. By 
safeguarding crops, these compounds enhance production yields and profitability for farmers. However, 
the various methods of pesticide application result in both direct and indirect exposure, leading to 
adverse effects on human health and the environment. Neonicotinoids, a relatively new class of 
pesticides on the market, have become the most widely used insecticides worldwide (SimonDelso et 
al., 2015). Their prevalence highlights the critical need for regulatory oversight. They were rapidly the 
target of authorities for one major environmental issue, as the origin of the colony collapse disorder 
(CCD) in honeybees, first reported in 2006 (van Engelsdorp, Hayes, Underwood,  Pettis, 2008) and 
invertebrate aquatic species (Josephus F. Borsuah 2020).
