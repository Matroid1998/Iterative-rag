Within this area, the Ritter re
action offers a straightforward approach for synthetic chemists, 
harnessing alkene or alcoholderived carbocations and ni
triles.24 Since its inception in 1948,5,6 the Ritter reaction has 
undergone continuous development towards greener conditions 
and to broaden its precursor pool.7,8 Notably, the advent of oxi
dative radicalpolar crossover (RPC),9 which sequentially ex
ploits the reactivity of radicals and cations, has enabled the in
tegration of the Rittertype process into atom and stepeconom
ical multicomponent reactions (MCRs).10 In this regard, three
component alkene difunctionalizations11,12 represent a hot topic 
nowadays as (i) olefins are inexpensive and readily available 
organic feedstocks,13 and (ii) the introduction of two new, or
thogonal functionalities into the CC bond results in a rapid in
crease in molecular complexity, enhancing sp character and 
thereby contributing to the Escape from Flatland strategy in 
drug discovery.14,15 In recent years, various alkene difunction
alization protocols have incorporated the Rittertype amidation 
as the final step to trap the carbocation, generated via Giese
type addition and RPC of the radical intermediate, starting from 
both heteroatomic (N,16 O,17,18 P19 and S)20 and carboncentered 
radical precursors.

Description:
Involved in carboamidations where alkyl radicals are generated.

Text:
In the realm 
of alkene carboamidations, alkyl radicals can be generated via 
thermal processes (5080 C) from diacyl peroxide reactants in 
the presence of an iron catalyst or by activating the C(sp3)H 
bond of alkane reactants using benzoyl peroxide and radical ini
tiators (Figure 1A).2528 Building on these findings, the groups 
of Chen and Maity reported photoredoxcatalyzed carboami
dation protocols using bromo nitriles, ketones and esters as 
radical precursors (Figure 1B).29,30 Noteworthy in these reports 
are the use of costeffective starting materials along with addi
tives (KF or Zn(OAc)2) that completely suppress alkylbromin
ation byproducts resulting from atom transfer radical addition 
(ATRA).31 However, these conditions depend on electrophilic 
cyano and ketoester primary radicals, thus limiting the gen
erality of the approach.
