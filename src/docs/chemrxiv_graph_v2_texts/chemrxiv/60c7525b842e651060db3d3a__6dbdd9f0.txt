Description:
A cofactor in PSI and PSII, coordinated by magnesium ions.

Text:
In PSI, the inner pair of cofactors is formed by Chl a
and its C132epimer (Chl a), which are called PB and PA, respectively. Similar to the
case of PSII, the pair of accessory PSI pigments is composed of Chl a molecules (denoted
as A1A and A1B), whereas pheophytins and plastoquinones are replaced by Chl a co
factors (A0A and A0B) and phylloquinones (A1A and A1B), respectively. In both PSI and
PSII, magnesium ions of innerpair Chls are coordinated by histidine (His) aminoacid
residues, whereas those of accessory pigments are coordinated by water molecules.

Description:
A monomeric accessory chlorophyll involved in the primary electron donor P680 in photosystem II.

Text:
Despite these structural similarities, the redox potentials of the primary electron donors
P700 in PSI and P680 in PSII (the numbers within their names refer to the absorption
maxima) dier by about 0.7 V and are equal to 0.5 V and 1.2 V, respectively 3. This
makes the donors P700 and P680 the strongest reducing and oxidation agents, respectively,
known in living matter. These electron donors are composed of dierent cofactors 4
P700 consist of the inner pair Chls, while P680 is a monomeric accessory Chl a. Addi
tionally, it is known that after photoexcitation PSII performs onesided electron transfer
(ET) along the protein subunit D1 57, while a twosided ET is observed in PSI 8,9.
