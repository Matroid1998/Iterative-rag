Description:
A nitrogen-containing compound investigated for its importance as a building block in various applications.

Text:
Efficient syntheses of nitrogencontaining compounds, such as 
alkylamines and pyridine derivatives, have been continuously 
investigated 
with 
numerous 
stoichiometric 
and 
catalytic 
approaches, owing to their importance as building blocks for 
pharmaceuticals, 
agrochemicals, 
and 
natural 
product 
analogues.1 One of the most potent catalytic reactions to prepare 
selectively substituted alkylamines from readily available 
substrates is the hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes, which involves 
CH bond activation at the position to the amine nitrogen atom 
with early and late transition metal complexes (Fig. 1, top).27 The 
catalysts for the olefin hydroaminoalkylation have been 
conventionally developed based on d0 early transition metal 
catalysts (Figure 1A). The first hydroaminoalkylation of 1alkenes 
with dimethylamine was reported by Clerici et al.
