Description:
Reduced to form spherical gold seeds in nanoparticle synthesis.

Text:
Furthermore, it is important to note
that achieving reproducibility in nanoparticle synthesis can be challenging, given the sensi
tivity of the process to numerous experimental variables including human factors,7 reagent
impurities21 and stock solution age, that are often missing or poorly described in the recipes. Among a number of AuNP synthesis protocols, seedmediated growth of gold nanoparti
cles has been a popular method to produce AuNPs with anisotropic shapes.12,22 This method
separates nucleation and growth processes in separate flasks leading to more controlled
growth stages. Briefly, spherical gold seeds are formed through the reduction of Au(III)
