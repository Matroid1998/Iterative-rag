Description:
Formed through oxime formation reactions.

These include hydrazone and oxime formation and the 
inverse electron demand DielsAlder reaction.3134 However, this does not solve the aforementioned problem because the 
rate of these processes is fast enough that much of the coupling occurs outside the cell to create a large PROTAC. Instead, we are interested in exploring the use of rapidly reversible covalent reactions for the construction of PROTACs. As mentioned above, potent PROTACs mediate the formation of a ternary complex in which there are significant neoPPIs. Therefore, if TP and E3 Ub ligase ligands were equipped with the appropriate reversibly reactive moieties, the coupled 
equilibria shown in Figure 1 might funnel the molecules into the thermodynamic sink of the ternary complex.
