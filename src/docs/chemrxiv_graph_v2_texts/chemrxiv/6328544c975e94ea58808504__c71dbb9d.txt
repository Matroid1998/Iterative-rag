Description:
A polymer inserted into the pores of a flexible microporous MOF.

To date, the introduction of polymers into MOF pores has been shown 
to improve the chemical and mechanical stability of MOFs.1113 For instance, we previously 
demonstrated that the addition of a nonnative polymer inside the pores of a mesoporous MOF 
inhibits interligand  stacking, a phenomenon that restricts linker rotation that otherwise 
puts stress on the metalligand bond causing structural collapse.12 In another study, Uemura et 
al. selected a flexible microporous MOF and inserted polystyrene.
