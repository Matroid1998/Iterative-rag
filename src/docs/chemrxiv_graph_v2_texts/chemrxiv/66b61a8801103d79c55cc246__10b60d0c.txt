Description:
Considered one of the most important fuels in any future net zero carbon society.

Text:
Hydrogen (H2) has a high massbased energy density1 and 
produces only water (H2O) as a combustion byproduct in a fuel 
cell engine. On this basis, H2 is considered one of the most im
portant fuels in any future net zero carbon society. At present, 
natural gas reforminggasification is widely used to produce H2 
because it is the most efficient and least expensive approach. However, this process is neither cost effective nor environmen
tally friendly.2,3 As an alternative, pure H2 (also referred to as 
green H2) can be obtained from H2O via electrocatalytic tech
niques.

Description:
An affordable fuel whose widespread adoption is hindered by the cost of platinum-based catalysts.

Text:
However, the most efficient and durable electrocatalysts 
currently available for promoting the hydrogen evolution reac
tion (HER) are nanoparticles (NPs) made from expensive rare 
metals, such as platinum (Pt),4,5 which prevents the widespread 
adoption of H2 as an affordable fuel. To shift to a net zero car
bon society, it is indispensable to produce more appropriate 
catalysts with a higher activity than Pt NPbased catalysts. Recently, Lee et al.
