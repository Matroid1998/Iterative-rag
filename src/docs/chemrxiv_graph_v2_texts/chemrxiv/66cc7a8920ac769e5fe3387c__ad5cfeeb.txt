Description:
A complex with tridentate ligands used for ligand engineering.

The
theoretical predictions were conrmed by transient optical
absorption spectroscopy. The central theme of the present
paper is to extend this study to a larger set of substituents
to achieve the netuning of the quintet lifetime. N

to as Nax in the text, are in green. As opposed to complexes with simpler mono or biden
tate ligands, complexes with tridentate ligands seem more
promising candidates for ligand engineering. The reason for
this is that the behaviour of complexes with the simpler
ligands at a spin state transition depends almost exclusively
