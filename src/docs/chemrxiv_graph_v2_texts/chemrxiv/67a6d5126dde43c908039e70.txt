Since it was first prepared and characterized in condensed phase in 2019, 
cyclo18carbon (C18) has attracted great attention of materials scientists.1 Currently, 
reams of theoretical research have been conducted on multiple fronts of C18 and related 
systems, including aromaticity,28 vibrational spectra,9,10 optical properties,1114 
intermolecular interactions,1520 tunneling effect,21 electron transfer,2225 reaction 
characteristics,18,25,26 and so on.2731 Our research on the optical properties of C18 
demonstrated that C18 exhibits strong ultraviolet absorption and significant thirdorder 
optical nonlinearity,11,12 which makes it a promising material for ultraviolet filters and 
nonlinear optical (NLO) applications. Boron (B) and nitrogen (N) are elements adjacent to the carbon (C) on the periodic 
table, with smaller and larger electronegativity than the C element, respectively.
