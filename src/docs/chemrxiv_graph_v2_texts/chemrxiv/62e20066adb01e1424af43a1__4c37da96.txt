Description:
Used for biointerfacing due to its favorable conductivity, electrochemical stability, and biocompatibility.

Text:
Such strict and specific requirements have given way to a large body of work focused on 
synthetically tailoring CPs for particular bioelectronic applications. Derivativescomposites of 
poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have been thoroughly utilized, in particular, for 
biointerfacing 
due 
to 
their 
favorable 
conductivity, 
electrochemical 
stability, 
and 
biocompatibility.11, 16 Functional derivatives of PEDOT have been synthetically designed with side 
chains to enable aqueous processability,1718 enhanced surface adhesion,19 or postpolymerization
