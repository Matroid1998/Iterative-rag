Description:
Garnet type solid electrolytes with high conductivity and electrochemical stability against Li metal electrodes.

Text:
Garnet type (A3B2(XO4)3) SEs possess high conductivity and electrochemical stability against
Limetal electrode30 and are one of the most promising SE material system. These ceramics
have a Youngs modulus of 50 GPa and shear modulus 60 GPa, which is signicantly
larger than the modulus of Li metal, suggesting a resilience against lament growth accord
ing to Monroe and Newmans model. A large series of garnet oxides have been developed as
SE of which one notable composition is Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)31. This material exhibits two
