dihydrolactucin (DHLc) and lactucopicrin (DHLp) effectively inhibited 
the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DHLp was also effective 
against Staphylococcus aureus, while DHLc showed good results 
against different strains of Candida.23 Antiparasitic properties were 
reported for STLs from chicory such as lactucin and lactucopicrin, 
notably against Plasmodium falciparum strain Honduras1.24,25 
Moreover, lactucin has also been linked to both in vivo and in vitro 
antiadipogenesis effects and anticancer activities.26,27
