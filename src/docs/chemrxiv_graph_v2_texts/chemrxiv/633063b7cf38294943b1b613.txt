Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical processes.

Text:
Electrocatalytic reactions play an increasingly important role. They are the central pro
cesses occurring in electrochemical energy conversion and storage 1 which are critical for
the energy transition towards a more sustainable future of our society. For example, hy
drogen and oxygen evolution are the basic reactions underlying water splitting, whereas the
reverse processes, hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction, are crucial in proton exchange
membrane fuel cells. In spite of the importance of these reactions and intensive research,
in particular the oxygen reduction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are
still hindered by substantial overpotentials which limit the eciency of fuel cells and water
electrolysis, respectively.
