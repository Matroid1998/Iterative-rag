Description:
A valuable metal recovered from end-of-life LIBs.

Text:
Recent efforts to 
reduce Co content in NMC batteries, due to its high cost and 
ethical concerns, have led to the development of high Ni 
variants such as NMC622 (LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O). It is estimated 
that, by 2050, the production of NMCbased LIBs from primary 
resources to fulfill the future demand will lead to the emission 
of greenhouse gases totaling 8.2 GtCO2eq.3 Thus, sustainable 
recycling of NMCbased endoflife LIBs by recovering valuable 
metals such as Li, Ni, Mn, and Co will not only reduce the burden 
on primary resources but also minimize the environmental 
impacts.

Description:
A valuable component found in black mass from end-of-life LIBs.

Text:
Another valuable component of endoflife LIBs is 
graphite (anode) which has been classified as a critical raw 
material.4 It accounts for 40  of LIBs by weight and recycling 
graphite has also gained traction recently.5 Recycling endoflife 
LIBs usually begins with the preparation of black mass, which is 
produced by safely discharging, shredding, grinding, and then 
milling the endoflife LIBs.6 Black mass (BM), a fine powder, 
contains valuables such as Li, Ni, Mn, Co, graphite, and small 
amounts of Al and Cu current collectors. Material characterization 
techniques are significant 
in 
developing sustainable and efficient pretreatment and 
recycling processes for endoflife LIBs.
