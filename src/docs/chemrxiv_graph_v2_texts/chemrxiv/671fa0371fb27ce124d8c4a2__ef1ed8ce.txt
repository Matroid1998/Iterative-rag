Description:
Networks containing reversible dynamic covalent bonds with a glass transition temperature below room temperature.

Silicone vitrimers constitute a unique class of polymers that can combine the high extensibility of 
elastomers with the selfhealing and reprocessability properties of covalent adaptive networks. 16 These 
combined features arise from highly mobile poly(siloxane) networks that contain reversible dynamic 
covalent bonds in their molecular structure. Because the glass transition temperature of poly(siloxanes) 
lies well below room temperature, silicones display the characteristic high extensibility of polymers in 
the rubbery state. 3, 4 Dynamic covalent bonds that rely on associative interactions allows the covalent 
network to adapt its topology while maintaining a constant density of crosslinks. Several types of 
dynamic covalent bonds have been exploited to synthesize silicone vitrimers.
