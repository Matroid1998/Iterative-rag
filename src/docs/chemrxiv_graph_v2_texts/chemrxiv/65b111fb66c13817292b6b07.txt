Description:
A component of small molecules and radicals that are highly reactive.

12 The 
handling of such small molecules, radicals and ions is usually difficult, if not impossible, in bulk solutions 
due to their notorious reactivity, which often results in uncontrolled follow up reactions.13 
Small nitrogen and oxygen containing carbon compounds are of particular interest for the evolution or 
prebiotic systems since they are assumed to be precursors to the molecules of life such as amino acids 
or nucleobases.14 One of these molecules is cyanoketene (1), which may add water to form amino 
acids. While several N and Ocontaining organic molecules have been observed in the ISM (Fig.
