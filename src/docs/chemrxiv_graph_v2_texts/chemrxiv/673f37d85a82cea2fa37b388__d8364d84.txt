Description:
Involved in elimination reactions under mechanochemical conditions.

However, 
the need for environmentally friendly synthetic processes has spurred exploration into alternative methods. In this context, 
mechanochemistry is a green and sustainable technique that not only minimizes waste generation but also offers unique reaction 
pathways and selectivity profiles, inaccessible through conventional solutionbased methods.4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 In 2003, the first reports 
of aldol elimination reactions under mechanochemical conditions appeared. Those reactions used minerals (calcite or fluorite),14 CaO,15 
or triethylbenzylammonium chloride16 as catalysts and bases, or even proceeded without any catalysts.17,18,19 
Mechanochemistry has demonstrated remarkable promise in the synthesis of azobenzenes,20 aurones,21 merocyanine 
photoswitches and their modifications;22,23,24,25 as well as in the synthesis of macrocycles.26 However, to our knowledge, the 
mechanochemical synthesis of indigoid photoswitches has not been reported.
