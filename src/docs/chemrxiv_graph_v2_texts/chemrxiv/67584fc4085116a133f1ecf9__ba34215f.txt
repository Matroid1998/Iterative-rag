Description:
Sultams act as androgen receptor antagonists.

Fused heterocycles (both aromatic and saturated) are common 
structures present in a significant number of natural compounds 
and marketed drugs.13 Cycloaddition reactions are powerful tools 
to access such ring systems and generate complex molecular 
architectures in an efficient, atomeconomic, regio and stereo
selective manner.4 While numerous examples illustrating this fact 
exist in various subfields of heterocyclic chemistry,510 the 
cycloaddition approach was rarely used for the construction of 
bicyclic sulfonamides (sultams). Meanwhile, sultams gained much 
attention in medicinal chemistry as threedimensional isosteres of 
lactams and nonbasic analogs of saturated heterocyclic 
amines.1114 Fused bicyclic sultams have been identified as highly 
potent secretase inhibitors,15 casein kinase II inhibitors,16 
protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) antagonists,17 or androgen 
receptor (AR) antagonists18 (Figure 1).
