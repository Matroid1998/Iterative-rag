Description:
Used as cathode matrices in metalCO2 batteries due to high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and adjustable surface area.

Text:
There have been several advances in the cathode materials to reduce chargedischarge overpotential 
and improve roundtrip energy efficiency of alkali metalCO2 batteries since the commencement of metal
CO2 battery research over a decade ago.16,18,20,22 Carbonaceous materials, including ketjen black (KB), are 
widely employed as cathode matrices in metalCO2 batteries due to their favorable attributes such as high 
electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and adjustable surface area.2426 However, the catalytic 
performance of nonpolar carbon materials is limited. To address this, recent research has focused on
