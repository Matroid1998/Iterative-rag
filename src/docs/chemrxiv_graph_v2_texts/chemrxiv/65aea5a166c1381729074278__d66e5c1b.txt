Description:
Partially metabolised in a demethylation step as a protective mechanism against toxic effects.

Text:
Ingested MeHg is partially metabolised in a demethylation step as a protective mechanism 
29 
to shield organs from potentially severe toxic effects associated with high MeHg levels. Following demethylation, 
30 
Hg was suggested to bind Lewis soft Se bases present in larger selenoenzymes6 to form inert HgSe (tiemannite) 
31 
nanostructures 79. Nano and microsized HgSe crystals have been identified by several different analytical 
32 
techniques and in a wide range of organs and tissues of cetaceans including brain, liver, kidney, muscle, and 
33 
spleen 4,1013. Mapping with synchrotronXRF showed the colocation of Hg with Se and determined a median 
34 
molar ratio (0.71) of mercury to selenium.
