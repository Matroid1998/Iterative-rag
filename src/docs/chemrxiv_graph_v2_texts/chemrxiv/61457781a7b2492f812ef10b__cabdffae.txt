Description:
Has vanishing first hyperpolarizability due to its octupolar character.

of carbonyl (CO) groups on molecular optical 
properties. The analysis results show that the successive introduction of CO groups 
leads to redshift of the absorption spectrum, but maximum absorption of all 
molecules is mainly due to the charge redistribution caused by electron transition 
within C18 ring. Except for the vanishing first hyperpolarizability of C18(CO)6 results 
from its octupolar character, the (hyper)polarizabilities of the precursors present an 
ascending trend with the increase of CO groups in the molecule, and the higherorder 
response properties are more sensitive to the number of CO groups. By means of 
(hyper)polarizability 
density 
analysis 
and 
(hyper)polarizability 
contribution 
decomposition, the fundamental reasons for the difference of (hyper)polarizability of 
different molecules were systematically discussed from the perspectives of physical 
and structural origins, respectively.
