Description:
A cofactor involved in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

Text:
Very recently, by leveraging the synergy between 
photoredox catalysts and biocatalysts, our group and other research
ers repurposed enzymes lacking a photoredox cofactor,4354 including 
pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP)4851 and thiamine pyrophosphate 
(TPP)53, 54dependent enzymes, to achieve stereoselective intermo
lecular asymmetric radical reactions with radicals generated outside 
the enzymes active site.
