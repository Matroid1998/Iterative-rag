Description:
Identified as one of the most perilous dioxins and classified as a human carcinogen by IARC.

Text:
The widespread environmental issue of organic pollutants toxicity has garnered signicant atten
tion and concern within both the scientic community and the general public. Dioxins, such as
polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), represent a
subset of these harmful organic pollutants. They originate from various sources like waste inciner
ation, cigarette smoke, car exhaust, and natural combustion processes 1, 2, 3. These substances,
known for their chemical stability, readily accumulate in fatty tissues and persist for approximately
11 years, posing a threat to both humans and animals. In particular, 2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin (TCDD), illustrated in Fig. 1, is identied as
one of the most perilous dioxins. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
classied TCDD as a human carcinogen 4.

Numerous studies have focused on addressing this
problem by exploring diverse chemical and physical processes for dioxin degradation. These ap
proaches encompass photocatalysis 5, 6, 7, hydrothermal degradation 8, burning 9, catalytic
degradation 10, radiolysis 11, 12, electrochemical oxidation 13, 14, and biodegradation 15. Figure 1 Schematic chemical structure of 2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin (TCDD). Recent studies have investigated various advanced sorbents, such as zeolites, metalorganic
frameworks (MOFs), and activated carbons, for the capture and removal of dioxins, particularly
TCDD. Zeolites, especially those doped with metals like silver, copper, and iron, have demonstrated
adsorption capabilities due to their high surface area and the ability to form strong interactions
