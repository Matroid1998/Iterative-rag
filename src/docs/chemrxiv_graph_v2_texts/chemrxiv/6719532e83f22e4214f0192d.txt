Description:
A residue used to create tritopic ligands for Pd3L4 cage self-assembly.

Creating functional, and particularly chiral, 
cage cavities remains challenging.22,23 
Figure 1. a. Oligoproline ligand used to assemble a Pd2L4 metal
peptidic cage in our previous work. Residues on the n and n3 are 
aligned on the same face of the helix, allowing installation of metal 
binding groups at the 1st and 10th residue.27,28 b. Additional modi
fication at the 4th or 7th residues with 4RS hydroxyproline creates 
tritopic ligands for Pd3L4 cage selfassembly. One way to functionalize the interior of metalorganic cages 
is to use tritopic, linear, ligands to create differentiated cavities 
in a single assembly in peanut cages.24, 25 However, the assem
bly of peanut cages from low symmetry ligands is rare, limit
ing their anisotropy.
