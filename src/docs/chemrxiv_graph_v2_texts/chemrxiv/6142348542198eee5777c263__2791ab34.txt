Description:
An electron-rich complex aiding in the nondissociative hydrogenolysis of N2.

Text:
The ternary ruthenium hydrides 
ability to efficiently synthesize NH3 at 10 bar and  573 K conditions 
lies in the unique chemistry of the coordination complex and the 
alkali (alkaline earth) metal framework, facilitating a catalytic 
mechanism bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous concepts, 
which are clearly distinct from the Ru metal catalyst. For ternary Ru 
complex hydride catalysts, Ru is in an ionic state, and N2 undergoes 
nondissociative hydrogenolysis over the hydride(H)rich and 
electronrich RuH64 complex with the aid of the surrounding Li or 
Ba cations. The dynamic and synergistic engagement of all the 
components of the ternary hydrides creates a reaction path with a 
narrow energy span and leads to ammonia production with superior 
activities.

Description:
A catalytic center in ternary ruthenium hydride that shifts intermediate and transition states in the N2H2 to NH3 reaction path.

Text:
In this paper, we present the reaction mechanism facilitating ternary 
ruthenium complex hydrides to successfully produce NH3 at low 
temperature (448 K  T  573 K) by selective N2 activation and 
escaping H2 oversaturation. This work shows the unique ability of 
the RuH64 catalytic center in the ternary ruthenium hydride to shift 
its ratedetermining intermediate states and transition states of the 
N2H2 to NH3 reaction path in response to the lowering of the 
reaction temperature, which brings a significant change in reaction 
order of hydrogen and ammonia. This variation in the kinetics as a 
function of operating conditions (temperature, reactant partial 
pressures, etc.) is not a common phenomenon in catalysis but is 
observed in some cases 1923.
