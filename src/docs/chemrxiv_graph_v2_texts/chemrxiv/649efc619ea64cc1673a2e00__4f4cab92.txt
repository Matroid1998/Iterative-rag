Description:
A rectangular-shaped hcp lattice surface consisting of three layers of gold atoms.

Text:
The potential energy of the system is written as
V  Vgold Vform Vint
(1)
where Vgold, Vform, and Vint represent the potential energies
of the gold surface, formaldehyde, and the interaction be
tween gold surface and formaldehyde respectively. We used a
rectangularshaped hcp lattice of Au(111) surface which con
sisted of three layers of gold atoms, with a total (ng) of 1045
atoms. The manybody semiempirical SuttonChen (SC) in
teraction potential17 was used to represent the bulk of gold
