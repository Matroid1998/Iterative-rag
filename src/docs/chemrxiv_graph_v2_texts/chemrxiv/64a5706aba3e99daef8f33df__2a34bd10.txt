Description:
A support material for bimetallic Ni4Cu1 catalyst in ethanol oxidation reactions.

So, which means that bimetallic alloys in diverse forms can be applied in many fields of chemical
engineering reactions. Hence, more recently, it is reported the application of bimetallic Ni4Cu1 supported over
polyphenylenediamine (Ni4Cu1PpPD) as potential candidate catalyst for efficient conversion of alcohol
especially ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline media as shown in Chemchoubs research article 28. (Ni4Cu1PpPD) catalytic features were anodic current density and the onset potential which was as high as 70.5
mAcm2 and 0.39 V respectively. In 2013, Wu, H et al 29 reviewed the advances on bimetallic Nibased
catalysts NPs synthesis, design and characterization for the steam reforming. Alloying Ni with both noble and
non noble metals are discussed.
