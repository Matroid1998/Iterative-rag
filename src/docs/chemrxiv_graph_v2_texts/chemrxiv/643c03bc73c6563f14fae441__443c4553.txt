Description:
Used in annealing hematite to generate oxygen vacancies and increase carrier density.

Text:
Zhao et al.24 have shown that by annealing pristine and Tidoped hematite photoanodes in Nitrogen 
gas at 600C the photocurrent is increased by 200  and 67  respectively. They assigned this enhancement 
to oxygen vacancies generated by nitrogen treatment, leading to carrier density increase. Opposite 
behaviors were found for the charge transfer processes, comparing pristine hematite and Tidoped 
hematite, suggesting increased transfer resistance for the later one. To the contrary, Wang et al.26 
demonstrated strong electrocatalytic surface contribution of the induced oxygen vacancies along to the 
expected improvement of the bulk conductivity. Such divergences arise from the variety of the employed 
sample preparation methods, leading to different sensitivities to subtle surface effects. These conclusions 
are obtained from PEC macroscopic measurements only, nanoscale information being absent.
