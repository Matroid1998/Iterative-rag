Description:
Used for synthesis of self-healing polymers and modular block copolymers.

Text:
Secondly, maleimides, 
particularly the bismaleimides are used for synthesis of selfhealing polymers1617, self
assembled functional telechelics and modular block copolymers18, reactive and functional 
polymers19 such as click chemistry2022. Maleimide derivatives are also used in chemicals 
applications such as dienophiles in cycloaddition reactions23, Thia Paterno Buchi Reaction24 
CH activation25 and functionalized basic maleimides26 are few of them.
