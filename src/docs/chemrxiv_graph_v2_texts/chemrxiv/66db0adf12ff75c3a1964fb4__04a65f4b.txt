Description:
Forms a cluster that coordinates with terephthalic acid to form UiO66.

2D MOFs are synthesized in lamellar sheets, where it has been shown that these layers can be exfoliated into monolayers which are 
attractive as a building block of thin films.13, 18, 19 
UiO66, named after the University of Oslo,20 is one of the most studied MOFs thanks to its exceptional chemical and thermal 
stability attributed to a strong ZrO bond and a high coordination number of Zr.21, 22 UiO66 is formed by the coordination of zirco
niumoxo cluster with terephthalic acid where an octahedral cage shares its eight triangular faces with eight tetrahedral cages (Figure 
S1), each featuring a scale triangular aperture. The pore size of UiO66 is attractive to differentiate molecules and ions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
UiO66NH2, formed by the coordination of hexanuclear zirconiumoxo cluster and 2aminoterephthalate (BDCNH2), possesses a 
cubic structure with a composition of Zr6O6(BDCNH2)6.20, 34 It has been reported that crystallinity can be enhanced with modulators 
such as hydrochloric acid,35 benzoic acid,36 formic acid,37 and acetic acid.38 Achieving 2D films of UiO66NH2 is particularly chal
lenging due to the isotropic bond strength, which makes it difficult to synthesize anisotropic UiO66NH2 directly. To address this, 
synthesis conditions were modulated by screening different amounts of acetic acid as modulator to improve crystallinity, various 
metal and ligand concentrations, metaltoligand ratio, and the pH. Importantly, water was used as a solvent, keeping sustainability 
in mind. Atomically smooth graphitic substrates were used to promote inplane growth.
