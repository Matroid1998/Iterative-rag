Description:
An anionic lipid that affects the structural properties of membranes.

Text:
Here we interrogate the effect of the anionic lipid 1palmitoyl
2oleoylsnglycero3phosphoglycerol (POPG) on OmpLA activity
with a specific focus on the role of the Ca2 cofactor. Cofactor ions
are generally important for protein folding, regulation and stabil
ity9,10. In the case of OmpLA, Ca2 ions are considered to sta
bilize active dimers by mutually aligning the active sites located
on the outer protein surface7. On the other hand, Ca2 ions are
also known to strongly bind and affect the structural properties
of membranes containing anionic lipids11,12. We thus hypothe
sized that asymmetrically distributed charged lipids might lead to
distinct behavior of OmpLA upon activation with Ca2 through a
mechanical coupling to collective membrane properties.
