Description:
Also known as white graphene when referring to boron nitride nanosheets.

Yet, a major setback of applying free laccase is the fast 
48 
loss of enzymatic catalytic performance and stability when encountering environmental factors 
49 
such as varied pH and fluctuating temperatures.4 To address that, the enzyme immobilization 
50 
technique has been employed, which entails attaching, crosslinking, or entrapping enzymes onto 
51 
a solid substrate or within a porous support matrix.2 Undergoing immobilization is expected to 
52 
render several advantages over free laccases (1) improved tolerance to harsh environmental 
53 
conditions, including extreme temperatures and pH levels;5 (2) easy recovery of enzymes from 
54 
treated wastewater or contaminated sites;6 (3) retained and augmented catalytic ability for 
55 
targeted compound degradation.7 To successfully synthesize powerful immobilized laccases, 
56 
selecting the appropriate supporting materials is a crucial aspect.8 
57 
We envision that boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), also known as white graphene, are 
58 
promising for laccase immobilization.
