can also play an important role in climate change and the
development of capture strategies is interesting not just for
environmental concerns but also for the possibility of reusing
them in other industrial chemical processes. 17
Hofmannlike clathrates with general formula Fe(pz)M(CN)4
(pz  pyrazine, M  Ni, Pd, Pt) 18 are a versatile class of
MOFs with octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) centers con
nected by cyanide ligands, CN, to a squareplanar open
metal site, M(II). The resulting FeMII(CN)4layers are
pillared by bidentated aromatic ligands resulting in three
dimensional networks. These materials are interesting for
gas capture applications due to the combination of open
metal M(II) sites and bistable Fe(II) spincrossover centers.

Description:
A member of the Hofmann-like clathrates series with significant CO2 and CO uptake capacities.

These can undergo a spinstate switch under the influence
of external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, light or
incorporation of guest molecules. The presence of unsatu
rated metal centers can, potentially, enhance the adsorption
capacity, 19 whereas their bistability can be used for sensing
applications. Several studies of gas adsorption have been
published 2026 since their discovery in 2001, 18 including
the interplay between spincrossover and guest molecules. Recently, the member of the series Fe(pz)M(CN)4 with
M  Pt(II) has shown a significant higher CO2 and CO
uptake capacities compared to other MOFs with larger sur
face areas. 27 In this work, we focus our interest in these
Hofmannlike clathrates upon CO2 and CO loading.
