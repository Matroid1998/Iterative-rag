Description:
Undergoes two-electron oxidation catalyzed by VCPO.

attacking.3 In order to begin the study of the catalytic mechanism 4 of this enzyme, one first 
has to decide what is its resting state. In many cases, the investigation of the mechanism of 
catalysis of enzymes requires a determination of the resting state.5 

Scheme 1. VCPO catalyzes the twoelectron oxidation of halide.
