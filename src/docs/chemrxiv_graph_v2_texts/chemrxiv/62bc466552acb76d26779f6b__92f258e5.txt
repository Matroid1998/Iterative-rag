Description:
Bioactive compounds that can be prepared under forcing conditions.

3 Examples of bioactive C(sp2)sulfonates include D) suramin, an approved medication for 
treating river blindness and African sleeping sickness; 4 E) an inhibitor against coenzyme A binding site 
of choline acetyltransferase 5 and F) an indole derivative possessing PGD2 receptor antagonist activity. 6 
Furthermore, the mechanism by which sulfur trioxide (SO3) is transferred in a SEAr reaction to afford these 
type of aryl C(sp2)sulfonate has been of perennial interest and reinvestigated by several groups. 719 
In turn, methods to prepare these N(sp2)sulfamated precursors are limited 2024 and C(sp2)sulfonated 
compounds are often only achievable under more forcing conditions (Chart 1). 2529 An orthoselective 
aminative rearrangement of (arenesulfonyl)hydroxylamines has recently been revealed. 30
