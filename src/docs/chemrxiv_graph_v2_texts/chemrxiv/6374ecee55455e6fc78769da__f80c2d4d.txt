Description:
An additive used in the reaction, which can be lowered to 1.5 eq. without significant loss to yield or selectivity.

Interestingly, the reaction showed a significant concentration 
dependence (entry 8, for details see ESI) and running the reaction at c  0.066 M was found to be 
ideal to furnish ()1 in e.r. 973 and 84 isolated yield. The loading of the nBu4Cl additive could 
also be lowered to 1.5 eq. without any significant loss to the yield or selectivity (entry 9). Under 
these optimized conditions, rapid deracemization of rac1, with depletion of ()1, was observed 
by reaction monitoring and completion was reached after 100 min (Fig. 2D). An assessment of the 
effect of temperature on the enantioselectivity revealed a classical temperature dependence in the 
form of ln(e.r.) 1T (Fig. 2E). Having established optimized conditions, the scope and limitations of this method were 
investigated (Fig.
