Description:
Adsorption on magnesium can lead to the corrosion of Mg metals.

Text:
Typically, one
would expect that the adsorption of negatively charged
species such as anions on a surface would lead to a dipole
moment at the surface that would increase the work
function of the metal surface. Results of firstprinciples
electronic structure calculations using density functional
theory have demonstrated that this anomalous behavior
can be attributed to a strong polarization of the halogen
atoms upon adsorption 1517. To the best of our knowledge, the adsorption of chlo
rine on magnesium has not been intensively studied yet
from a computational point of view. The existing studies
were motivated by the fact that chlorine adsorption could
lead to the corrosion of Mg metals 1820.

Description:
Adsorbs on metal anodes as the first step in anode conversion upon discharge in Cl-ion batteries.

Text:
These com
putational studies found that Cl preferentially adsorbs
in the threefold hollow positions on Mg(0001) associ
ated with a slight increase in the workfunction. Upon
the operation of a Clion batteries, the metal anode will
be converted to a chloride salt which provides the ther
modynamical driving force for the discharge of a Clion
battery. The energy gain upon this conversion does in
fact represent the driving force in the Clion battery op
eration 5, 6. This means that the adsorption of chlorine
on the metal anode does only correspond to the first step
in the anode conversion upon discharge.
