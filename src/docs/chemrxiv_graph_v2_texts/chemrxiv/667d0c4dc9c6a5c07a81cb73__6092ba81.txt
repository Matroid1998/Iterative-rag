Description:
A quasihexagonal-phase 2D carbon material with a semiconducting bandgap.

The allure of metalfree semiconductors with narrow bandgaps
has captured significant attention in recent decades, proving
exceptionally versatile for various electronic applications such
as infrared devices, lightemitting diodes, electrocatalysts, and
thermophotovoltaics. This interest has been further fueled by
the emergence of twodimensional nanomaterials in material sci
ence and engineering following the groundbreaking discovery of
graphene by a collaborative effort in the past decade14. Recently, a breakthrough occurred with the experimental realiza
tion of a singlecrystal 2D carbon material, termed monolayer
quasihexagonalphase fullerene (C60), boasting a semiconduct
ing bandgap of approximately 1.6 eV5. This achievement ad
dresses the issue of null bandgaps observed in other 2D carbon
based materials. Using an organic cation slicing strategy, re
searchers exfoliated quasihexagonal bulk single crystals to ob
tain monolayer polymeric C60.
