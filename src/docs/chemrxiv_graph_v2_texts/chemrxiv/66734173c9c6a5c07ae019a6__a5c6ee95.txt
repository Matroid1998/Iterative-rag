Description:
A compound whose wettability is improved to enhance stability and efficacy.

Text:
In addition, excessive production of 
related substances in the body not only impairs the stability and efficacy of the drug, but 
also increases the risk to patient health. In this study, we have tried to improve wettability of S309309 and suppress the amount 
of the degradation product (4R)3amino5,7difluoro2(5methylpyridin2yl)
2,2,3,7tetrahydrospiro1benzopyran4,6pyrazolo4,3c
3 
yridine4(5H)one 
(compound 8) that forms under acidic conditions by simple methods.
