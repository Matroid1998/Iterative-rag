Description:
A compound used in electrochemical reduction to produce organic chemicals.

Text:
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (eCO2R) is an emerging tech
nology that is capable of producing various organic chemical compounds out
of CO2. Being integrated with renewable energy systems, eCO2R has been
known as a promising alternative to conventional fossilbased chemical produc
tion. Recent research on eCO2R has focused on synthesis of novel catalysts for
the production of, e.g., carbon monoxide, formic acid, ethylene, and ethanol 9. In addition, electrode and reactor design 25, conceptual process design 7, and
technoeconomic and sustainability analysis 20 are of interest as well. The electricity cost is one of the major cost drivers of eCO2R technologies
14. A straightforward solution to the electricity cost reduction is to lower the
overpotential of, particularly, the anode oxygen evolution reaction 24.
