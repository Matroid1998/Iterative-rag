Description:
A molecule whose loading is underestimated by UFF in MOFs with open metal sites and overestimated in fully coordinated AlMOFs.

Text:
However, MOFs have a much richer local chemical environment than those used to
fit the UFF force field. Open metal sites are a wellknown example where the UFF
fails to capture the chemical environment accurately, typically leading to a significant
underestimation of the CO2 loading.9,10 Also, for CO2 adsorption in fully coordinated
AlMOFs, UFF substantially overestimates the isotherms.7
To improve the predictions of the adsorption properties for those systems where
UFF fails, researchers have refitted the force field parameters against experimental
isotherms or quantum mechanical (QM) calculations for specific MOFs.1014 For ex
ample, PerezPellitero et al.
