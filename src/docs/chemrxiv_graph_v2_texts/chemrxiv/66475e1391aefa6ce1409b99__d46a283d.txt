Description:
Participates in metal-hydride hydrogen atom transfer reactions with Fe(acac)3.

Text:
The few enantioselective semipinacol rearrangement protocols 
that involve aryl migration involve enantiospecific nucleophilic 
displacement of an enantioenriched halonium,14,15 or hypervalent 
iodine species16 and create keto functionalised products.10 
Related polar rearrangements involving 1,2aryl shifts have 
employed chiral Brnsted acids, which instead involve 
noncovalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst.17
19 In the context of hydrosemipinacol rearrangements with allylic 
alcohols, the addition of a proton or hydrogen atom to the CC 
bond can be used to instigate reactivity (Figure 1B). The latter has 
been demonstrated via metalhydride hydrogen atom transfer 
(MHAT) using a superstoichiometric quantity of Fe(acac)3 with a 
silane,20 or photocatalytically using a cobalt catalyst.21 The 
carboncentered radical generated after the HAT step undergoes 
a neophyltype rearrangement to afford racemic ketones with 
electrondeficient aryl rings migrating preferentially.
