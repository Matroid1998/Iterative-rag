Description:
Used in polymers that exhibit UCST and physical gelation behavior in ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures.

Text:
The clear liquid turned into a 
turbid gel upon cooling.10 Theato and coworkers described polymers based on 
vinylcyclopropane and investigated their UCST and physical gelation behavior in ethanol and 
ethanolwater mixtures at different concentrations.11 The transition temperature hysteresis 
between the heating and the cooling phase was very large (about 45 K). Another class of 
thermoreversible physically crosslinked hydrogels formed from ABA linear triblock 
copolymers was reported recently.12 The polymers feature a hydrophilic poly(poly(ethylene 
glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PPEGMMA) middle block B and flanking UCSTtype
