Description:
An intermediate in the Friedel-Crafts type alkylation of diarylethanol.

Text:
Lis group reported a deoxygenative dimerization from 
diaryl ketones, inspired by a classical WolffKishner type of diaryl
methane synthesis.13 This is an excellent method that can synthe
size diaryl ketones in two steps (2 pots) through the formation of 
hydrazine as an intermediate. Morans group then developed a one
pot synthesis of triarylethanes from aryl epoxides.14 A ringopening 
reaction of the epoxide by an electronrich arene was followed by a 
FriedelCrafts type alkylation of the resulting diarylethanol with 
another electronrich arene via a phenonium intermediate. Alt
hough this method appears to be a classical synthetic method, a 
variety of electronrich triarylethanes can be prepared.
