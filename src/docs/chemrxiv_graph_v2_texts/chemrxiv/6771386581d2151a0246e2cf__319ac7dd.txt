Description:
A compound studied for its interfacial behavior in ionic liquids.

LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl as has been 
experimentally demonstrated by Gaddam et al.20 and Smith et al.21 
Most of the earlier models fall short in capturing the intricate interfacial behavior observed in 
ionic liquids (ILs) due to the interplay of van der Waals, Coulombic, dipolar, and solvophobic 
interactions.22,23 To this end, Kornyshev and coworkers in 2007 used the PoissonFermi 
equation to model concentrated ionic liquid interfaces employing a meanfield latticegas model 
to derive an analytical expression for the differential capacitance.24 Around the same time,
