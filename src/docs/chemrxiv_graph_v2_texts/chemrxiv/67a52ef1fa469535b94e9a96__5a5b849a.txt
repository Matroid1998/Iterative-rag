Description:
Produced from the conversion of methane through photocatalytic coupling using solar energy.

It is important to design green reactions that pro
vide sustainable energy, cleaner environment and lesser 
emission of greenhouse gases in the coming future. The 
global reliance on nonrenewable sources of energy has 
contributed to the growing environmental and climate 
challenges. Solardriven energy generation through 
heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a sustainable 
solution to these challenges.15 Photocatalytic coupling 
of methane to ethane by using solar energy at room 
temperature is a promising approach for conversion of 
methane (CH4) to ethane (C2H6). The thermo catalytic degradation of sp3 hybridized 
highly 
symmetric 
CH4 
with 
strong 
CH 
bonds 
(434 kJ mol1) requires very high temperature and also 
low selectivity in products and CO2 emission.
