Description:
A material used in microfluidics known for its physical and chemical versatility.

Since their inception three decades ago, microfluidic platforms have repeatedly redefined stateof
theart approaches to fluidic automation, biochemical assays, highthroughput clinical screening, 
and a plethora of other areas 16. Glass and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have represented two 
key materials of choice in the microfluidics space, due to their physical and chemical versatility. The use of both these materials in microfluidics has been comprehensively discussed in our recent 
reviews 7,8. However, the widespread implementation of devices composed of glass and PDMS 
has been severely limited by their costly and laboursome fabrication process, poor scalability, and 
high variability between devices. From a materials perspective, PDMS microfluidic platforms have 
demonstrated poor surface treatment stability and high susceptibility towards biomolecule 
adsorption, making them impractical for most biomedical applications 9.
