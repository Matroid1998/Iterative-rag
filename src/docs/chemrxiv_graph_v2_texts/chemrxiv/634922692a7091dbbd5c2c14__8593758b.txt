Description:
A gas used in NMR experiments to study CO2 adsorption.

Text:
However, different CO2 adsorption products often give rise to very 
similar signals in the NMR spectrum and assigning these signals to specific CO2 binding 
modes remains very challenging.8,1720 
The most common experiment with the NMR approach is to dose the candidate adsorbent 
with 13CO2 gas and perform 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments. These 
experiments are relatively straightforward to perform, but often lead to ambiguous 
identification of the adsorption products.
