Description:
A gas emitted in smaller amounts by geothermal power plants compared to coal or natural gas power plants.

Text:
Geothermal energy is the thermal energy contained within the crust of the earth and can be used 
to generate electricity. Geothermal power plants are comprised of similar components as coal or 
naturalgas power plants (e.g. turbines, compressors, heatexchangers), but are driven from 
energy derived from the subsurface instead of burning fossilfuels. This subsurface energy is 
accessed by producing geothermallyheated fluids from a well. As a result, geothermal power 
plants emit substantially less carbon dioxide (CO2) compared to coal or natural gas power plants, 
but can still provide ondemand, or dispatchable, electricity, unlike other renewable energy 
technologies (e.g. solar photovoltaics).

Description:
Extracts heat more efficiently than water in enhanced permeability systems.

Text:
In contrast, accessing the heat within hot dry rock 
resources requires artificially increasing permeability by hydraulic stimulation and then pumping 
an external fluid through the enhancedpermeability system.10 Water is typically considered as 
the external fluid, but CO2 has been shown to extract heat more efficiently due to its advantageous
