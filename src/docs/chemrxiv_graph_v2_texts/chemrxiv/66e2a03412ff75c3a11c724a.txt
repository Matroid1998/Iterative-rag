Description:
A small molecule involved in activation processes for production.

While virtual highthroughput screening (VHTS) with density functional theory (DFT) and 
machine learning (ML) has greatly accelerated the in silico design of molecules1216 and 
materials,1621 discovery of molecular catalysts remains an open area of research,11,22,23 including 
for smallmolecule activation, such as in the production of hydrogen,2426 ammonia,2730 and 
methanol.3133 Researchers have carried out extensive computational investigations into ligand 
effects on catalytic TMCs in various reactions.3440 Indeed, both computational4143 and 
experimental4446 studies aim to build libraries of ligands10,47 and understand how they influence 
the properties of derived TMCs.4850 While a number of automated methods exist for ligand 
design,43,5155 and ML can help target design objectives for the derived TMCs,5457 it is still 
intractable to perform explicit calculations for the entirety of the TMC design space.
