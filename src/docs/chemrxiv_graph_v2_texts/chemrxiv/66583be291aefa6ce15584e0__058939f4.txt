Description:
Involved in prebiotic acylation reactions.

Text:
First, it is not clear if prebiotic synthesis and hydrolysis pro
cesses could have led to the selection of natural over non
natural diacyl phospholipids. Prebiotic acylation reactions of 
individual glycerol phosphates have been reported,16,17 but no 
direct comparison has been made of the reactivity of G1P and 
G2P with activated fatty acids, nor of the hydrolytic stability 
of the corresponding phospholipids. Second, it is not clear if 
differences in membrane properties could have led to the se
lection of natural phospholipids from heterogeneous mixtures 
containing both natural and nonnatural forms. Hybrid lipo
somes often behave differently from those made of individual 
lipids and so their behavior is difficult to predict.
