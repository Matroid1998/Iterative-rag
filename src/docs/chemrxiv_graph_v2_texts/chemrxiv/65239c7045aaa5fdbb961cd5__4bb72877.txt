Description:
Inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria by coordinating to lipid I, lipid II, and undecaprenyl pyrophosphate.

Text:
A detailed study of one rhenium 
complex suggests that part of its mode of action involves inhibition of peptidoglycan 
synthesis in Grampositive bacteria by coordinating to lipid I, lipid II and undecaprenyl
pyrophosphate C55PP.17 The group of Schatzschneider has first reported the 
antimicrobial activity of a manganese based lightactivated CORM (photoCORM) in 
2014.18 This complex and related ones have been extensively studied for their 
antimicrobial properties in the last decade.1922 The same group also described
