Aidu Qi and his team found that 
process intensification technologies such as onsite heat productionremoval can allow precise control of 
reaction and heat and mass transfer rates, and, consequently, improve overall efficiency and mitigate the 
requirement for materials and capital investment 2. Therefore, understanding the basic thermodynamic 
parameters of reaction is essential for optimizing alkane combustion reactions, which are fundamental to 
modern energy production. The enthalpy change represents the heat released during combustion, directly 
correlating with the energy output of fuels. Precise knowledge of H enables engineers to select appropriate 
alkanes for specific applications, ensuring efficient energy utilization. For instance, the heat of combustion 
for alkanes increases with molecular weight, influencing their suitability for various energy needs 3.
