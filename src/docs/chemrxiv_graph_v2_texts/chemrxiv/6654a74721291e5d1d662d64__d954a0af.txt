Description:
A solvent used in the reaction at 100Â°C.

Text:
in dioxane at 100 C for 12 
hours, the target compound 11 was not obtained, and the 
byproduct oxindole 12 was observed instead (entry 1). In contrast, 
when L1 was used as the ligand, the desired compound 11 was 
obtained with an isolated yield of 13, while the major byproduct 
was the dehalogenated compound 13 (entry 2). Similarly, using 
L2 as the ligand resulted in a 9 isolated yield of the target 
compound 11, but the dehalogenated compound 13 was still 
produced as a byproduct (entry 3). When L3 or L4 were used as 
ligands, the desired compound 11 was not obtained, and only the 
cyclization precursor 10 was recovered or the dehalogenated 
compound 13 was observed (entries 4 and 5).
