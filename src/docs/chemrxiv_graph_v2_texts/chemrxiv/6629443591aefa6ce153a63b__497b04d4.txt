Description:
A high surface area, mesoporous semiconductor used in photoanodes.

Text:
At the photoanodes of both WSDSPECs and DSSCs, light ab
sorbing dye molecules (and water oxidation catalysts in the 
former case) are anchored to a high surfacearea, mesopo
rous semiconductor, which is typically TiO2. WSDSPECs are 
operated in buffered aqueous solutions.
