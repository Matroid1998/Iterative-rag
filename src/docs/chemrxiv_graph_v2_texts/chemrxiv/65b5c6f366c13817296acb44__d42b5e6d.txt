Description:
Involved in native chemical ligation to produce noncanonical phospholipids.

Text:
While several 
studies have observed stabilizing effects using mixed membranes (1621 , an intriguing alternative is that chemical 
reactions between simple and abundant molecules could have led to the generation of more complex amphiphilic 
species. In this scenario, a nonenzymatic protometabolism would be required to generate lipid species that would then 
spontaneously assemble to form a closed membranebound protocell. However, to date there are no robust examples 
of chemistries that can lead to well characterized celllike membranes from shortchain precursors. Previously, we had reported that a cysteine (Cys functionalized lysophosphatidylcholine lipid undergoes native 
chemical ligation (NCL with sodium 2mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA thioesters to produce noncanonical 
phospholipids (22, 23 .
