Description:
An electron-cation transporting OMIEC active for oxygen reduction with pH-dependent selectivity for the 4-electron versus the 2-electron product.

Recently, organic mixed ionicelectronic conducting polymers (OMIECs) have been 
reported to exhibit catalytic behavior for electrochemical reactions.1115 OMIECs are 
semiconducting conjugated polymers with synthetically tunable structures and transport 
properties enabled by electrochemical ioninsertion redox reactions.16 These electrochemical 
doping reactions drive the insertion of mobile ions and electrons (or holes), providing 
functionality for a range of electrochemical devices.1621 For electrocatalysis, holeanion 
transporting OMIECs (ptype), including PEDOT (poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)) variations, 
have been studied for oxygen reduction and display selectivity for the 2electron reaction.13,14,22 
BBL (poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)), an electroncation transporting (ntype) OMIEC, 
has also been shown to be active for the ORR, with pHdependent selectivity for the 4electron 
versus the 2electron product.15 These studies highlight the potential of OMIECs as electrodes 
for oxygen reduction, but the fundamental design principles that control their activities and 
selectivity are still being developed.
