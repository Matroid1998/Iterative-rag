Heavy metals are highly important for several industrial applications and technologies including nano
technology120. However, the imbalance concentration of heavy metals in water exhibit a negative impact on 
the environment. The high concentration of heavy metal exhibit toxicity. Thus, there are several methods to 
detect the concentration of heavy metals in water prior to adjusting the concentration of these species in water 
via several methods such as adsorption2125. Bipolymers such as cellulose and chitin are promising for several applications24,2634. Chitosan (CTS, with 
a chemical name of (1,4)2amino2deoxydglucan) is a natural and abundant biopolymer 3540. It is the 
deacetylated form of chitin that can be isolated from crustacean shells. It exhibits several properties such as 
high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mucoadhesive properties.
