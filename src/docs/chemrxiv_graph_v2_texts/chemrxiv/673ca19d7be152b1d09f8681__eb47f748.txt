Description:
Low molecular weight species known to be ineffective in catalyst activation.

Text:
The average molecular weight and presumably the molecular 
weight distribution of hydrolytic MAO (hMAO)15 is known to be 
important in metallocene catalyst activation. Low MW species 
such as (Me2AlOAlMe2)n (n  3 to 4)16 are known to be 
ineffective,17 while early synthetic methods emphasize the 
formation of higher MW material as confirmed through 
cryoscopic measurements.18 Cryoscopic measurements of 
commercial hMAO (W. R. Grace)19 suggest a (number) average 
MW () of ca. 1100 g mol1 while small angle neutron 
scattering (SANS) studies of hMAO (ChemturaLanxess) 
suggest a higher (weight) average MW () of 1803  55 g mol
1 with a spread in values of between 1400  2800 g mol1 
depending on free Me3Al content ( 1803 corresponds to ca.
