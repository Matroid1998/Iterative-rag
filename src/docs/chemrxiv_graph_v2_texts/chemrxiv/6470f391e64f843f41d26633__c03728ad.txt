Description:
The hydrolysis product of bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate and bis(2 ethylhexyl) adipate.

Text:
Hydrolysis has been identified as a potentially important indoor chemistry process, responsible 
for secondary emissions of several notable indoor pollutants.1 In the context of indoor 
environment, it was first speculated as a source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in studies 
observing the effect of relative humidity on VOC emission from building products in the 1990s.2,3 
Since then, the discussion on hydrolysis in indoor air has gained attention due to its association 
with 2ethylhexanol, the hydrolysis product of bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and bis(2
ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA).

Description:
A compound believed to be generated via hydrolysis of DEHP and DEHA.

Text:
Incidents of asthmalike symptoms, referred to as sick building 
syndrome (SBS), have been reported following occupant exposure to 2ethylhexanol, believed to 
be generated via hydrolysis of DEHP and DEHA found in polyvinylchloride (PVC) flooring.47 
While hydrolysis of synthetic esters (SEs)such as DEHP and DEHAis relatively slow even 
under alkaline conditions which may be present on concrete,810 the ubiquitous nature of SEs in 
the indoor environment raises concerns about the possible contribution of these pathways to poor 
indoor air quality during both acute SBS episodes and more ordinary conditions.
