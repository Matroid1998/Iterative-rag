Nevertheless, as environmental protection is increasingly aware, the high volatility and 
toxicity of hydrazinebased fuels are more and more concerned by practitioners and the public.5 In response 
to these concerns, developing environmentally friendly propellants with desirable characteristics such as high 
energy density has nowadays become an active research topic.6 
In 2008, a groundbreaking discovery showed that imidazolium dicyandiamide ionic liquids 
spontaneously combust with white fuming nitric acid (WFNA), soon stimulating numerous studies on 
hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs).7 Boronbased HILs are a class of green liquid propellants, which consist of 
boron, borane, and boron cluster compounds or other ion designs based on the unique structure of boron 
atoms combined with energetic ionic liquids.8 This family of ionic liquids as fuels has a high specific impulse, 
high stability, low toxicity, and low vapor pressure.
