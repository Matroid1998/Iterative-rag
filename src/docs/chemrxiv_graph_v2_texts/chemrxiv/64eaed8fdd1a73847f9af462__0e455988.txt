Description:
A strong acid used to break down robust polyaromatic structures.

Text:
Lignin is made of different polymerised aromatic units, and its utilisation remains 
challenging due to the robustness of its polyaromatic structure, which requires harsh 
conditions to break down the polymer (e.g., strong acids such as H2SO4).6, 7 Unlike cellulose, 
lignintochemical conversion technologies remain scarce.4, 5, 7, 8 An important linkage in lignin, 
often found between its aromatic polymeric backbone, is the bO4 bond between two phenyl 
rings, which serves as an ideal target to depolymerise lignin into smaller fragments.911 Thus, 
the selective depolymerisation of all lignocellulose components and their subsequent chemical 
transformation would enable largescale access to aliphatic and aromatic renewable feedstock 
chemicals.
