Description:
An antiplasmodial alkaloid.

A heterocyclic system of 1Hpyrrolo2,3cpyridine, which is also named 6azaindole, is a 
valuable object for medicinal chemistry. This core is not represented in nature as is. Still, its 
benzofused analogue carboline is a wellknown scaffold for the plenty of natural compounds 
(787 structures are presented in the Reaxys database). Recently representatives of another 
benzofused system, 3Hpyrrolo2,3cquinoline have been found in natural objects, e.g. antiplasmodial alkaloid Aplidiopsamine A 1 and antifungal Pyonitrin family 2 (Figure 1, A). However, 6azaindole heterocyclic system has brought an FDA approved HIV entry inhibitor 
Fostemsavir 3.
