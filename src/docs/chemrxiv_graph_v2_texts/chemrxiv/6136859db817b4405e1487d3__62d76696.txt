Description:
Displays inverted bands at the Lpoint of the Brillouin zone in the rocksalt phase.

Text:
The partial contributions of atomic orbitals
to each band suggest that SnTe, SnSe, SnS, GeSe, and GeS in the
rocksalt phase have inverted bands at the Lpoint of the Brillouin
zone, while PbTe, PbSe, PbS, and GeTe do not, in agreement with
previous studies.26,27
All compounds with normal band ordering exhibit a single car
rier pocket at the Lpoint for both the conduction and valence
bands, whereas the shapes of the band edges are more diverse
for compounds with inverted bands. For example, while SnTe ex
hibits a single carrier pocket for the conduction and valence bands
centered at each Lpoint (Figure 1a), each halfpocket breaks into
three full carrier pockets that are offset from the Lplane (i.e.

in an overall 6 increase in the valley degeneracy from NV  4
to NV  24. Additionally, rocksalt GeSe and GeS both exhibit a
toroidal conduction band Fermi surface (Figures 1c and S1e) as
opposed to a single conduction band pocket. It is interesting that similar compounds with inverted bands ex
hibit diverse Fermi surface geometries, some with a single pocket
centered at each Lpoint and others with multiple carrier pockets
