Description:
An active site in hydrogenases for reversible electrocatalysis.

Enzymatic electrochemistry has rapidly expanded into research fields that encompass 
applications across disciplines from fundamental understanding of enzymology to biosensors, 
biofuel cells and semiartificial photosynthesis.1,2 Hydrogenases (H2ases) combine protons 
and electrons to reversibly produce H2 at the thermodynamic potential using Fe or NiFe active 
sites and have therefore been extensively studied as a model system for reversible 
electrocatalysis.3,4 Formate dehydrogenases (FDH) have similarly garnered attention due to 
their ability to reversibly reduce CO2 to formate, with high selectivity when immobilised on an 
electrode.58 Bioelectrochemistry on thinfilm electrodes has long provided mechanistic and 
analytical insight into enzyme function, as well as establishing bioelectrolysis as a potential 
method of product synthesis.1,3,9 Porous electrodes enable higher enzyme loading, and hence 
higher current densities, improving the overall performance by increasing the consumption or 
production of desired chemicals.1015 
Solution assays provide insight into the influence of bulk pH and ionic strength on enzyme 
activity and the conclusions have informed the choice of electrolyte in electrochemical 
studies.16,17 However, the high current densities achievable using the latest generation of high 
surface area electrode scaffolds, usually used as stationary electrodes, presents a 
significantly different local chemical environment during turnover to that of bulk solution 
assays.
