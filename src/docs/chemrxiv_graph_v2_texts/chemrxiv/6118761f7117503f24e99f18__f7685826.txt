Prevalent and valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis.

Text:
Alkenes are among the most prevalent and valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Direct and selective 
difunctionalization of alkenes, which simultaneously adds two synthetically valuable functionalities across a 
double bond, is a straightforward and economical approach to construct functionalized targets with high

molecular complexities.13 Specifically, the direct incorporation of sulfur4,5 and fluorine6 into alkenes has 
attracted intensive research interest of synthetic chemists due to the important roles of both elements in organic 
synthesis, life science, and materials science. For instance, organic molecules containing both sulfur and 
fluorine are present in many wellreceived pharmaceuticals, such as Flovent, Faslodex, and Glecaprevir 
(Scheme 1A).

Targeted molecules for the direct incorporation of sulfur and fluorine elements.

Additionally, the spatial vicinity of these two elements further renders these types of compounds 
as ideal research targets of the fundamentally intriguing sulfurfluorine gauche effect.7 It was found that the 
oxidation states of sulfur in these compounds are strongly correlated with their functions. Therefore, it is 
highly desirable to develop synthesis protocols to simultaneously introduce sulfur and fluorine elements into 
targeted molecules with precise control of the oxidation states of the sulfur moieties.810
