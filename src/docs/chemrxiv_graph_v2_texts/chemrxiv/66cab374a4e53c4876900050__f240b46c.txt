The shortage of fossil fuel forces the development of novel sustainable energies 
31 
(Shang et al., 2023; Ahmad et al., 2023). Lignocellulosic biomass materials are 
32 
attractive alternative energy resources because of their high accessibility and 
33 
renewability (Tyagi et al., 2022; Tilman et al., 2006). In recent years, hydrogen 
34 
production technology from the gasification reaction between biomass and steam has 
35 
attracted the attention of academia and industry because of the efficient utilization of 
36 
energy from agricultural feedstocks (Lanjekar et al., 2023). However, direct utilization 
37 
of biomass faces difficulties in the collection, transportation, as well as spoilage during 
38 
storage (Rosenfeld et al., 2020; UNDP India, 2013).

Description:
Generated through the pyrolysis and gasification of biomass.

To solve these problems mentioned 
39 
above, biomass is usually converted into biomassderived biochar through pyrolysis 
40 
(commonly at 300400 oC), and these pyrolyzed feedstocks further react with steam to 
41 
generate hydrogen (Srivastava et al., 2014; Narnaware et al., 2017; Hamelinck and Faaij, 
42 
2002). 43 
However, the pyrolysisgasification method for hydrogen production from biomass 
44 
materials has some demerits. Firstly, higher temperature during pyrolysis inhibits the 
45 
production of biomass char, converting more carbon into tar and carbonaceous gas 
46 
(Zhang et al., 2024), which may lead to a diminution in hydrogen production during the 
47 
subsequent gasification.

Moreover, incomplete conversion of biochar during 
48 
gasification reduces hydrogen yield and concomitantly increases the formation of toxic 
49 
gas CO, which poses another problem of this type of hydrogen production technology 
50 
(Yokoyama et al., 1983; Wang et al., 2008). To sustainably obtain hydrogen energy from 
51 
agricultural feedstocks, this study investigated the generation pattern of hydrogen and 
52 
other byproduct gases from biomass material (with or without pyrolysis pretreatment) 
53 
during gasification and subsequently found out the optimum conditions for hydrogen 
54 
production. 55 
Zea mays stalk (ZMS) is a widely distributed biomass in the rural areas of North 
56 
China, which has high biochar productivity during pyrolysis.
