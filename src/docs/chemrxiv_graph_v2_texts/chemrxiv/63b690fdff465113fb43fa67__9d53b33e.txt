Description:
Materials with a crystal structure used in photovoltaics for their stability.

In the last few years there has been a growing interest around layered or socalled two
dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites (MHPs) for their superior moisture and air stability, 
thanks to which they found application in photovoltaics to design 2D3D solar cells 
architectures.1 The most investigated families of 2D perovskites are the RuddlesdenPopper 
(RP) and DionJacobson (DJ) phases of general formula A2An1MnX3n1 and AAn1MnX3n1, 
respectively, where A and A are organic cations, and n represents the number of staggered 
inorganic layers made of metal M and halide X atoms.2 Leadbased members with n1 of the 
RP family, i.e.

Description:
Contain linear monoammonium cations and have been explored for their crystal structure and phase transitions.

A2PbX4, have been thoroughly studied thanks to the extremely rich variety of 
organic spacers which can be incorporated into the layered structure giving origin to an 
impressive modulation of their optical, structural and moistureresistance properties.2,3 2D RP 
perovskites containing linear monoammonium cations of general formula (CnH2n1NH3)2PbX4, 
have been among the first to be explored, even before the advent of MHPs photovoltaics.49 
These early studies mostly focused on the elucidation of the crystal structure as a function of 
the number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain as well as on the understanding of the phase 
transitions commonly found in these compounds.
