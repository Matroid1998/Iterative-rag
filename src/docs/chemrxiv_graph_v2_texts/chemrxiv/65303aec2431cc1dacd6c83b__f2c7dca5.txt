Description:
Produced from water using electrolysis and used to power proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, our generations are witnessing the energy revolution, in 
which fossil fuels are gradually being replaced by renewable energy sources.13 In that sense, 
proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) accompanied by batteries, play a key role in 
establishing fully electrified transportation and replacing conventional internal combustion 
engine vehicles.35 To complete the water cycle, PEMFCs will also have to be powered by 
using green hydrogen produced from water using electrolysis where the electrical energy is 
sourced using emissionsfree sources such as wind and solar energy.6 However, while 
establishing supply, storage and transportation is a grand challenge by itself,7 PEMFCs as a 
downstream technology for hydrogen use also have to solve many major bottlenecks to keep 
up with the massive scalability of hydrogen technologies in the next decade.810 Namely, one 
of the largest such bottlenecks can be found in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA)  the 
Ptbased electrocatalyst.

Description:
Involved in the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in electrocatalysis.

Text:
Although the electrocatalyst is essential for both the anodic hydrogen 
oxidation reaction (HOR) and the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),9 the cathode 
requires many times higher amount of the Ptbased electrocatalyst than the anode resulting 
from significantly slower kinetics of the ORR.11 On the other hand, although there are various 
very important studies about nonprecious group metal (nonPGM) electrocatalysts,1215 in 
reality the only electrocatalyst applied at the production level for PEMFCs used for transport 
applications is still the Ptbased electrocatalyst.16,17 Due to a very high price of deficient Pt, it 
represents almost half of the total costs of the PEMFC system manufacturing,18 even when 
considering the economies of scale.19 One of the most promising approaches to reduce both the 
quantity of Pt per vehicle as well as the costs related to platinum per PEMFC system is to alloy 
Pt with a less noble and at the same time less expensive metal (M  Co, Cu, Fe or Ni),16,2024 
which enables better Pt utilization, i.e.
