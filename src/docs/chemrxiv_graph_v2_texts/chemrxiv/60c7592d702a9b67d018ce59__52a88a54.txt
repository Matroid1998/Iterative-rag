Description:
Studied as prospective solid electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Bismuth and indiumbased complex oxides, i.e., oxides containing multiple metal
cations, are important functional inorganic materials with a central role in many
optoelectronic and energyrelated applications. Tindoped bixbyite indium oxide (In2O3) is an
ntype transparent conducting oxide13 used in display technology,4,5 electrochromic smart
windows,68 and photovoltaics911. Complex indiumcontaining oxides are being developed for
the next generation of electronic materials.1216 Lithium indium oxides have been studied as
prospective solid electrolytes for allsolidstate lithiumion batteries.1719 Substituted versions
of fluorite bismuth oxide (Bi2O3)2023 and Aurivilliustype mixedmetal bismuth oxides
20,24,25 host some of the highest known high oxygenion conductivities.
