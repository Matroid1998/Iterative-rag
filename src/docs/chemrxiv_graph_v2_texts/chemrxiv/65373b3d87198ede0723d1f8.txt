Description:
An industrial polymer with nonpolar characteristics.

Text:
Natural fiberreinforced composite materials are of particular interest to researchers because they 
combine high mechanical properties with low density. These compounds have a number of advantages, 
including low cost, access to renewable natural resources, and biodegradability 56. The fundamental disadvantage of using natural fibers as reinforcement is the lack of compatibility 
between the fibers and the matrix. The polar and hydrophilic properties of natural fibers are incompatible 
with the nonpolar characteristics of most industrial polymers, such as unsaturated polyester. When exposed
