Description:
A pathway that generates ribulose 5 phosphate from D-glucose.

Text:
In the de novo pathway, Kdo is produced from ribulose 5
phosphate, which is a product generated from Dglucose through the pentose phosphate pathway, by 
the action of several enzymes.1012 In the Kdo salvage pathway, exogenous Kdo is imported by the sialic 
acid transporter NanT, which was recently found to be involved in the uptake of Kdo and a derivative 
of Kdo in E. coli cells.13 The Kdo from either pathway is subsequently activated to its CMP derivative 
(CMPKdo) by CMPKdo synthase, and transferred to lipid A by CMPKdo transferase (Figure S1).13 
8Azido3,8dideoxymannooct2ulosonic acid (Kdo8N3) is a synthetic derivative of the 
natural compound Kdo that contains an azide moiety on the primary carbon.
