Description:
Reactive species revealed by the excitation of diazirine groups, capable of undergoing CH, OH, or NH insertion.

Text:
Diazirine groupsstrained threemembered rings containing 
two doubly bound nitrogen atomsrelease nitrogen gas upon 
thermal or photochemical excitation, revealing reactive 
carbenes that can undergo CH, OH, or NH insertion to 
nearby substrates (Fig. 1A). First popularized by Brunner for use 
in biological target identification,1 trifluoromethyl aryl diazirines 
have been used extensively to search for proteinbinding 
partners for bioactive small molecules (Fig. 1B).24 Thanks to 
their small size (relative to alternative photoactivatable groups 
like benzophenones), excellent stability (in the absence of 
bright light), lack of toxicity,5 and desirable activation 
wavelength (ca. 365 nm; considerably longer than that required 
for activation of benzophenones or aryl azides), trifluoromethyl 
aryl diazirines have emerged as the gold standard for target 
identification experiments.

Overview of diazirine reactivity and utility in chemical biology. A 
Photochemical or thermal activation of diazirine reagents reveals reactive 
carbenes that can engage in XH insertions to nearby substrate molecules. B 
Photoaffinity labelling of target proteins with diazirineenabled small molecules 
allows for identification of macromolecular binding partners.
