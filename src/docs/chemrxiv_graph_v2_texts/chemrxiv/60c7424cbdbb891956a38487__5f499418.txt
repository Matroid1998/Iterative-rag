Description:
Passes through a pore formed by transmembrane helices in voltage-sensitive channels.

Text:
Here we will be 
38 
concerned with the way a K channel senses voltage. Each VSD of a Na or K channel has four 
39 
transmembrane (TM) helical segments, linked by extra or intracellular loops that extend beyond the 
40 
membrane. The fourth TM helix (labeled S4) is connected via a linker of several amino acids to a 
41 
domain with 8 TM helices, 2 extending from each VSD, that together form the pore through which the 
42 
ion passes. Channels of the type we are discussing are closed when there is a voltage of approximately 
43 
70 mV, (minus meaning intracellular side negative with respect to the extracellular side), that holds 
44 
the channel closed; with 0 mV across the channel, it is open. Fig.
