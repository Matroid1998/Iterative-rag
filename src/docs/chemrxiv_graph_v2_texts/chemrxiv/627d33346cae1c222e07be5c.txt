Description:
Constructed through 22 cycloadditions, which are photochemical reactions.

Text:
Perhaps the most prominent class of photochemical reactions are 22
cycloadditions, which construct cyclobutanes, oxetanes and azetidines.911 In contrast to the analogous 
DielsAlder 42cycloadditions, 22cycloadditions are thermally forbidden due to incompatible 
ground state orbital symmetries (Figure 1A). The key stages of EnT photocatalysis are shown in Figure 
1B. Light energy is used to promote a triplet sensitiser from the ground state (S0) to a singlet excited 
state (S1), which then undergoes intersystem crossing to a triplet state (T1). Since relaxation from T1 to 
S0 is spinforbidden, triplet intermediates are relatively longlived compared with singlet excited states. Commonly employed triplet photosensitisers include conjugated aromatic ketones such as 
benzophenone, xanthone, and thioxanthone, which display high quantum efficiencies for population of
