Description:
Enhances drug effectivity and selectivity by improving solubility, lipophilicity, membrane permeability, metabolic stability, and receptor binding when exchanged with hydrogen.

Text:
Aniline is a prominent aromatic amine compound broadly used as a versatile chemical precursor for the 
synthesis of bioactive compounds,1 polymers,2 and azo dyes3 (Figures 1ac). There is also a growing 
number of fluorinated anilinebased drugs ranging from antiinflammatory, antidepressant, antibiotic, 
antiviral, and anticancer derivatives (selected examples are shown in Figure 1d).4 Fluorinated drug 
effectivity and selectivity are enhanced, leading to increased biological activity. This is due to the 
improvement of many chemical and biological properties (e.g., solubility, lipophilicity, membrane 
permeability, metabolic stability, and receptor binding) when exchanging hydrogen with fluorine in the 
parental compound.4b, 5
