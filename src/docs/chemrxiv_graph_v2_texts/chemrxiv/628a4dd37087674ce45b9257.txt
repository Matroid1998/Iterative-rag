Description:
A material used in perovskite solar cells with two phases: a photoinactive hexagonal phase and a photoactive black phase.

Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)1,2 based perovskite solar cell (PSC)38 have emerged
as the most promising cheaper photovoltaic technology with certified solar to power con
version efficiencies for singlejunction 25911 and perovskitesilicon tandem solar cells
reaching 30.8,1214 There are two commonly known phases of this material black phase
and hexagonal yellow phase. Among these, thermodynamically stable hexagonalFAPbI3 is
a photoinactive material and consists of facesharing PbI octahedral chains surrounded by
1

FA cations. Alternatively, the metastable blackFAPbI3 is made of cornersharing PbI
octahedra and a champion photoactive material commonly used to make highly efficient
and stable PSCs.
