Description:
Forms metal anodes that can achieve theoretical maximum energy density in batteries but face challenges like dendritic growth.

Text:
Owing to their high energy density, large voltage window, and versatility,14 lithium (Li) ion
batteries (LIBs) have, over the last two decades, taken over a signicant share of the bat
tery market. The substitution of standard graphitebased anodes by Li metal would enable
such technology to achieve its theoretical maximum energy density.35 However, successful
widespread use of Li metal anodes has not been feasible, partially due to phenomena hap
pening at the surface of the anode, such as growth of dendritic structures, and formation of
voids and pits.611
Moreover, the low safety, high costs, and sustainability concerns related to LIBs have
limited their use to emerging markets, namely, portable electronics, automotive transporta
tion, and electric aviation,1216 all of which require energy densities matched only by LIBs.
