Description:
A commonly used fluorophore.

Text:
Despite decades of endeavors by experimental chemists, only a few uorophores are
commonly used, such as uorescein,8 BODIPY,9 cyanine,10 and SeoulFluor.7,11 For exam
ple, various BODIPY derivatives are discovered by modifying the sindacene core structure.9
SeoulFluor is developed based on the indolizine core.7,11 These molecules are designed to
have distinct emission frequencies by attaching diverse functional groups to their core struc
ture.7,9,11 With traditional approaches, nding a novel molecular scaold takes considerable
time and resources to synthesize and verify candidate compounds.12
Theoretical approaches such as quantum mechanical (QM) calculation or machine learn
ing (ML) may solve this problem more eciently than conventional approaches. Diverse QM
approaches have been developed to predict the photophysical properties of molecules.1318
Most previous studies focused on predicting the photophysical properties of inorganic solids.
