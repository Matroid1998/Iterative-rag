Titania nanocrystals have applications in medicine, photocatalysis, and photovoltaics.15
Zirconia nanocrystals are components for (in)organic composites.1 Hafnia nanocrystals have
found use as resistive switching elements,6,7 as scintillators,8 as computed tomography con
trast agents,1,9,10 and as sensitizers in radiation therapy.1,11 All three oxides (but zirconia
and hafnia especially) have high thermal and chemical stability making them attractive for
a wide range of applications from nanoelectronics to medicine.1214
Highly monodisperse and colloidally stable oxide nanocrystals can be obtained via non
aqueous surfactantassisted syntheses.1 A particularly successful strategy is the reaction of
metal alkoxide with metal halide in trinoctylphosphine oxide (TOPO).1,1517 Anatase tita
nia is thus produced at 300 C, while tetragonal zirconia is formed at 340 C, and monoclinic
hafnia is formed at 340360 C. The surface of the obtained nanocrystals is covered by a
mixture of protonated TOPO, dioctyl phosphinate, and dioctyl pyrophosphonate.18 Control
over the final properties of the nanocrystals is highly sought after shape,19,20 size,2123 dop
ing,24 and crystal structure.24 However, so far, achieving such synthetic control remains a
challenge.
