In light of the evergrowing consequences of fossil fuel consumption, the development of green, 
lowemitting technologies like electrosynthesis is becoming increasingly important. The last 
decades of work in this field have focused on water electrolysis1 to produce H2 as an energy 
vector and chemical feedstock as well as CO2 reduction2,3 to generate carbonbased fuels and 
commodity chemicals. However, these two classes of products do not fully meet the needs of 
society and the chemical industry. Against this backdrop, a recent push in the field of 
electrocatalysis has been to expand the scope of products that can be generated from abundant 
building blocks (e.g.
