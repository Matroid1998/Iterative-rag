Description:
A pervasive and persistent environmental pollutant due to its structural stability.

Text:
It is due to their 
structural stability, and to their longterm unregulated industrial production and disposal, that 
PFAS have become pervasive and persistent environmental pollutants2. This in turn has motivated 
a rapid rise in efforts to understand PFAS toxicology, decontamination, and destruction. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and their anions are 
especially widespread and have therefore received relatively high scrutiny from the scientific and 
regulatory communities. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is empowered to 
develop nonenforceable, nonregulatory national Health Advisories to identify the drinking 
water concentration level of a specific contaminant at or below which exposure for a specific 
duration is not anticipated to lead to adverse human health effects.
