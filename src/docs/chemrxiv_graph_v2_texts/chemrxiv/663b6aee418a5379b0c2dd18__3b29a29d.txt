Description:
Participates in decarbonylative Suzuki-Miyaura coupling with aromatic boronic acid esters.

Text:
Dong and coworkers used 2aminopyridine 
as a transient directing group to achieve a decarbonylative 
SuzukiMiyaura coupling between indanone and aromatic 
boronic acid esters, as well as ring expansion reactions in
volving the insertion of ethylene and alkynes.2931 This 
method represents an excellent technique for catalytically 
transforming ketones without directing groups; however, it 
is restricted to cyclic ketones, and only ethylene and alkynes 
can form bonds with aromatic compounds after deacylation. Dai and colleagues reported a sequential transformation 
method. This technique involves the conversion of aromatic 
ketones into oxime esters, followed by a coupling with nu
cleophiles using a Pd catalyst.
