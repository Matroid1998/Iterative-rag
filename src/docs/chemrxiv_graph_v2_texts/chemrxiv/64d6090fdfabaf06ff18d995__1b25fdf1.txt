Description:
A group that can undergo ring opening side reactions.

Text:
of a cyclopropyl group at the amide acarbon position was well tolerated, with 
114 
the blactam product isolated in good yield and with excellent d.r. (2g, 66, 201 d.r.). We were unable to observe 
115 
the glactam byproduct in the reaction of this substrate, presumably due to a cyclopropyl ring opening side reaction. 116 
The introduction of heteroatoms ato the amide carbonyl was achieved without issue, with thioether (2h, 69 201, 
117 
101 d.r.) and ethercontaining substrates (2i, 72, 101 d.r., 201 r.r.) cyclizing in good yield. The electronrich 
118 
methyl ether derivative 2i was the only example where the antidiastereoisomer of the blactam was observed in 101 
119 
d.r..
