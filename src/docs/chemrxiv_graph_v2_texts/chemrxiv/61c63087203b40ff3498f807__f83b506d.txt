Description:
Cofactors that coordinate with Mo or W centers in the active site.

Text:
The highly conserved active site of MoW containing FDH3133 consists of the Mo or W
center coordinated by one or two dithiolene cofactors, known as molybdopterin guanine 
dinucleotides (MGDs) (Figure 1). In addition to these MGDs, the metal is coordinated by a 
selenocysteine (Sec), cysteine (Cys), or serine (Ser) residue and a terminal sulfido (MS) or oxo 
(MO) ligand in a distorted hexacoordinated trigonal prismatic geometry.34,35 Several 
mononuclear MoW complexes have been synthesized and characterized in an attempt to 
replicate this FDH active site.3640 Generally, Wdependent FDH enzymes carry out the 
conversion of the CO2HCOO with a higher turnover frequency than the Modependent 
counterparts.41 Similarly, enzymes containing selenocysteine are faster than their cysteine 
mutant.41 The relation between type of the chalcogen ligand and reactivity is not well
