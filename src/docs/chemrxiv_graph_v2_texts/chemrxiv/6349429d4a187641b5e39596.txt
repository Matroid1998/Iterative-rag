Description:
Compound class whose intrinsic properties can be affected by charge carrying species.

Text:
Here, structural information is provided in the 
form of collisional cross sections (CCS), which correspond to the size and shape of a given ion 
and can be compared to values computed from candidate geometries. For MS and IMMS experiments, neutral sample molecules require added chargecarrying 
species, AA, in order to be studied. The occurrence of different adduct ions M  A and 
M  A can be tuned by using AA containing solutions andor by changing ion source 
conditions.1 These charge carrying species can also affect intrinsic properties of the sample 
molecules, as previously reported for a range of compound classes such as carbohydrates,2 
steroids,3 fullerenes,4 and macrocycles.4,5 For example, Kellner et al.
