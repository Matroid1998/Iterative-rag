Description:
A mixture with small amounts of water that decreases the melting point compared to the pure hydroxide melt.

Text:
Synthesis pathways to Mn(V) compounds have traditionally relied on solidstate reactions 
at temperatures about 1000 C,12,13,15 but for the last decade, syntheses down to 250 C have been 
made possible by using aqueous precipitation in highly alkaline solutions,9 and by developing 
hydroflux approaches.10,14 In its common occurrence, a hydroflux is a mixture of alkali hydroxide 
with small amounts of water that enables a dramatic decrease of the melting point compared to the 
pure hydroxide melt.10,14 The hygroscopic salt retains water even at elevated temperatures, so that 
the water vapor pressure is also well below that achieved in hydrothermal conditions. Therefore,
