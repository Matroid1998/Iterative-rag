Description:
Present in open sites within zeolites and MOFs, facilitating redox-mediated reactions.

Text:
Porous materials, such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), are an attractive target for 
bioinspired heterogeneous catalyst design.2629 The welldefined metal sites contained in the 
secondary building unit (SBU) of the reticular MOF structure30, 31 have structural and electronic 
features that are analogous to the metal cofactors in metalloenzymes,32 including weakerfield 
ligands that favor highspin electron configurations that are needed for redoxmediated 
reactions,32, 33 as well as pore architectures that resemble an enzymes binding pocket.21, 34 Inspired 
by sMMO, zeolites containing open Fe sites in the square planar geometry3537 and subsequently, 
MOFs with SBUs containing open Fe sites in the square pyramidal geometry3840 have
