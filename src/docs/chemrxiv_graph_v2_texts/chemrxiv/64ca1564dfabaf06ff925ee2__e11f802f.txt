Description:
A six-coordinate analogue of FeP(NO) where ImH is imidazole.

Text:
Two FeNO7 systems were examined (see relevant experimental 
papers25,26,27,28,29,30,31) FeP(NO), i.e., a fivecoordinate nitrosylheme, and its sixcoordinate 
analogue FeP(NO)(ImH), where P is unsubstituted porphyrin and ImH is imidazole, a model 
for the amino acid histidine. Four oxidized FeNO6 systems, socalled metheme nitrosyl 
derivatives, were examined (see relevant experimental papers32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39) (iii) 
FeP(NO), (iv) FeP(NO)(ImH), FeP(NO)(NO2), and FeP(NO)(SMe). Finally, one 
reduced FeNO8 system, a hemenitroxide derivative, was examined (see relevant
