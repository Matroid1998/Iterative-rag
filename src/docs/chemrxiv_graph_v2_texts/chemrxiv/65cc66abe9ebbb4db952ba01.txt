In this instance, semiconductor nanoparticles of particular interest are zinc 
oxide nanoparticles (Subhan et al., 2022). ZnO nanoparticles have gained prominence 
due to their exceptional photocatalytic activity, wide bandgap, and biocompatibility. These nanoparticles are noteworthy as semiconductor materials, playing a pivotal role 
in a diverse array of applications. Their multifunctionality and versatility make ZnO 
nanoparticles indispensable in various fields (Hossain et al., 2023). The process of synthesis of nanoparticles is a significant factor that influences their 
properties and applications. While several methods exist for nanoparticle synthesis, 
green synthesis is gaining increasing popularity owing to its lower environmental 
impact (Patel, 2022). This ecofriendly approach involves the use of plant extracts, 
microorganisms, or other sustainable sources as reducing or stabilizing agents in the 
synthesis process.
