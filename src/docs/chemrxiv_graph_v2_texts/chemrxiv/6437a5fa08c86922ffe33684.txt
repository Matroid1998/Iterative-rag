Description:
A monocyclic terpene abundant in the essential oils of Citrus fruits.

Text:
Limonene (1methyl4isopropenylcyclohex1ene), namely the 
monocyclic terpene abundant in the essential oils isolated from 
the peel of nearly all Citrus fruits as the dextrorotatory isomer d
limonene (or ()limonene), is a key bioproduct of the emerging 
bioeconomy.1 The history of its identification, and ongoing 
misconceptions of the odourstructure relationship, is instructive 
also for todays chemistry educators and researchers.

Description:
A terpene with a boiling point between 175 and 177 degrees Celsius.

In 1884, 
Wallach and Brass reported that boiling cineol with hydrogen 
chloride gave a hydrocarbon, C10H16, of lemonlike odour.2 
Continuing his researches on terpenes, for which he was 
eventually awarded the 1910 Nobel Prize in chemistry, Wallach 
identified both limonene isomers, dextrolimonene from Citrus 
fruits and laevolimonene from Pinus (pine needle oils), and their 
racemate, which he called dipentene having identified a rule 
for which terpenes had the general formula (C5H8)n. In his 
monumental book Terpenes und Campher (1914), the chapter 
about limonene reads 

Under the name limonene and dipentene In 1884 I 
distinguished components of essential oils by the following 
properties 

Limonene. The boiling point is between 175 and 177.
