Description:
An alkali atom used in atomic magnetometers for sensing small magnetic fields.

Text:
Atomic magnetometers are used for sensing very small magnetic fields (down to 1
femto Tesla), where applications include biological imaging, geology, global positioning and
fundamental experiments.1,2 An alloptical atomic magnetometer operates as follows1 i) A
vapour of alkali atoms (K, Rb or Cs) within a glass vapour cell have randomly orientated
atomic spins; ii) Circularly polarised pump light aligns the spins with the pump beam and
when a small magnetic field is applied the spins precess in the magnetic field; iii) The
orientated spins rotate the polarization of linearly polarised probe light (Faraday rotation);
and iv) The intensity or polarization of the transmitted probe light measures the magnetic
field strength. An antirelaxation coat on the cell walls preserves the spin polarization
(lifetime) of the alkali atoms.
