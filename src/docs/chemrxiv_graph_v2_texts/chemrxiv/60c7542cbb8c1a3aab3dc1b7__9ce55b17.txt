A rhodium-based metal-organic polyhedron containing hydroxyl groups on its periphery.

of porosity into supramolecular gels endows 
soft materials with functionalities for molecular encapsulation, release, 
separation and conversion. Metalorganic polyhedra (MOPs), discrete 
coordination cages containing an internal cavity, have recently been 
employed as building blocks to construct polymeric gel networks with 
potential porosity. However, most of the materials can only be 
synthesized in organic solvents, and the examples of porous, MOP
based hydrogels are scarce. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of 
porous hydrogels based on Rh2(OHbdc)212, a rhodiumbased MOP 
containing hydroxyl groups on its periphery (OHbdc  5hydroxy1,3
benzenedicarboxylate). By simply deprotonating Rh2(OHbdc)212 
with the base NaOH, the supramolecular polymerization between 
MOPs and organic linkers can be induced in the aqueous solution, 
leading to the kinetically controllable formation of hydrogels with 
hierarchical colloidal networks.
