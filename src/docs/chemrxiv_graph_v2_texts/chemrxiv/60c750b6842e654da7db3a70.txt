Description:
A gas that can be dissolved in electrolytes and is involved in electrochemical reduction processes.

Text:
In a system design where the electrolyte is saturated with dissolved CO2,
mass transport limits the achievable CO2 reduction current density to below 50 mAcm2
irrespective of the nature of the catalyst employed.111 For the process to be economically
feasible, current densities in the order of 200 mAcm2 and greater are estimated to be
required in addition to the selectivity, overpotential and stability targets.1214 Gas diusion
electrodes (GDE) based cell designs have been demonstrated to successfully overcome this
mass transfer limitation in CO2 electrochemical reduction (eCO2R) systems.1521
The classical GDEbased eCO2R systems studied in literature are owcells or microuidic
cells following a general setup as shown in Figure 1a for the cathode half of the reactor.2231
The GDE cathode itself is typically composed of 3 layers 1) the gas diusion layer (GDL)
which acts as a gas distribution network for the incoming CO2 and outgoing gaseous prod
ucts to and from the catalyst, 2) a thin microporous layer (MPL) of carbon nanoparticles
deposited on the GDL which acts as the current collector and 3) the electrocatalyst layer
