Description:
A compound studied for its role in electrocyclic photochemical reactions.

Text:
by Robert Woodward and Roald Hoffmann in 1965. Recent advancements and the 
integration of timeresolved experiments and nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics 
simulations have transformed the traditional understanding of electrocyclic reactions beyond the 
WoodwardHoffmann rules. In this review, we focus on recent studies on 1,3cyclohexadiene and 
two of its derivatives, phellandrene and terpinene, to shed light on the underlying mechanisms 
of electrocyclic photochemical reactions. We highlight recent progress in ultrafast electron 
diffraction techniques and the simulation approach of ab initio multiple spawning (AIMS). Together, these approaches can elucidate molecular structure dynamics from femtosecond to 
picosecond timescales and nuclear and electronic response at conical intersections. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024jw2x3 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000206411279 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
