The merger of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) with transition 
metalcatalyzed oxidative radical relay (ORR) or oxidative rad
ical polar crossover (ORPC) has recently emerged as a promis
ing strategy to enable mild C(sp3)H functionalization reactions 
with nucleophilic coupling partners.1 Due to the prevalence of 
nitrogen functionality in bioactive compounds, this strategy is 
of particular interest as an approach to C(sp3)H amination for 
feedstock chemical conversion and latestage derivatization.2 
C(sp3)H amidations proceeding via HATORPC (Rittertype 
reactions) have been reported under a variety of oxidative con
ditions using solvent quantities of nitrile as the nucleophile.3 Of 
note, Lambert and coworkers have reported a mild method for 
Rittertype CH amidation via electrophotocatalysis, the only 
example to date that does not require stoichiometric oxidant.4 
Whereas most Ritter reactions target secondary and tertiary 
benzylic or unactivated tertiary C(sp3)H bonds, recently Knig 
and coworkers have disclosed a unique strategy for Ritter ami
dation, utilizing visible light excitation of in situgenerated io
dine(III)BF3 complexes to amidate primary benzylic CH 
bonds.5 
Despite these important advances, expansion of Nnucleo
phile identity beyond nitriles in solvent quantity is compara
tively less explored.
