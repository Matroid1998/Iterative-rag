Description:
Enhances the structural stability and reversibility of BiFO phases in a dual-ion battery.

Text:
Yamanakas group observed different reactivity and 
defluorination mechanisms of different BiF3 modifications (orthorhombic structure (oBiF3) and 
cubic structure (cBiF3)) in FIBs with liquid electrolytes by insitu Raman microscopy23, 24. They 
proposed that the defluorination of oBiF3 occurred via a direct defluorination mechanism while 
the defluorination of cBiF3 was most likely controlled by the competition between a direct 
mechanism and a dissolutiondeposition mechanism. Li and his group25 presented an aqueous 
dualion battery in which the preaddition of Bi7F11O5 to the BiF3 electrode composite can 
enhance the structural stability and reversibility of BiFO phases by formation of intermediate
