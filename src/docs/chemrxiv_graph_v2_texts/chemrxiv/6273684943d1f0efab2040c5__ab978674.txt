Description:
A clean energy source that can serve as a future reservoir of energy.

Text:
A myriad of problems and imminent threats are the repercussions of fossil fuel consumption; in recent 
decades, the methods of rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions have been a point of discussion. Also, in longterm decisions, humans should be conscious of the rapid depletion of the limited reservoir 
of fossil fuels. There are clean sources like hydrogen which can be our future reservoir of energy, and 
reliable technologies, for instance, fuel cells, especially Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells 
(PEMFCs). PEMFCs, directly convert the chemical energy of fuel and oxidant to electrical energy 1. They have suitable efficiency, high power density, and approximately zero emissions. Moreover, they 
can operate at low temperatures and pressures. However, some technical problems have constrained the 
complete commercialization of PEMFCs.

Description:
Studied in the context of hydrogen economy in PEMFCs.

Text:
Several studies have been conducted to solve the challenges of commercializing PEMFCs. Thermal 
management 2, water management 3, and oxygen transport resistance 4 account for the majority 
of investigations. The operating conditions of PEMFC 5, its flow field 6, and the optimization of 
properties of cells 5 have all been investigated. Modified catalysts 7, the properties of the Gas 
Diffusion Layer (GDL) 8, the clamping pressure of cells 9, degradation 10, hydrogen economy 
11 were also studied. The investigations unveiled the behaviour of PEMFC at different conditions. In high current densities, PEMFCs suffer from concentration loss or, in other words, oxygen starvation 
12. Some studies focused on the transport of oxygen 4,1218.
