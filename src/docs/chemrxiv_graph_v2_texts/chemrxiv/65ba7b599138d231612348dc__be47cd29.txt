Description:
Lanthanide ion with magnetic anisotropy originating from crystal field splitting, resulting in energy barriers up to ca. 2000 K.

Hence, attention turned to increasing the magnetic anisotropy. One solution was found in employ
ing lanthanide ions, especially dysprosium(III). Here, the magnetic anisotropy originates from the
crystal field splitting of the ground multiplet,4 resulting in energy barriers up to ca. 2000 K.58
An alternative approach is the usage of lowcoordinate transition metal ions,9 where spectroscopi
cally certified energy barriers of up to 650 K have been reported.10 In this respect, fourcoordinate
cobalt(II) complexes deserve special attention.
