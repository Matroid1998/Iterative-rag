Description:
A heavy atom that enhances spin-orbit coupling in fluorophores, improving phosphorescence efficiency.

Text:
However, studies on organic fluorescent dyes have shown that introducing heavy atoms, such as 
iodine (I), into the fluorophore enhances spinorbit coupling (the internal heavyatom effect), which 
increases the rate constant for intersystem crossing (ISC) from Sn to Tm, thereby improving the 
efficiency of phosphorescence.13 Similarly, encapsulating a heavy atom into AgS clusters may 
enhance the phosphorescence quantum yield. However, to date, there are limited reports on the 
internal heavyatom effect of ligandprotected metal clusters.14 
In this study, we successfully synthesized ligandprotected AgS clusters with central cavities 
encapsulating anions Xz, where Xz  S2 (sulfide) or I (iodide), which significantly differ in atomic 
number each other (Scheme 1).
