Description:
Involved in electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at cathodes.

Text:
The 
43 
former still needs breakthroughs in the issue of reaction products block subsequent 
44 
reactions 7; the latter is regarded as the safer and more reliable system, whose 
45 
electrochemical reaction rate largely relies on the electrocatalytic processes of oxygen 
46 
reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at cathodes 8, 9. 47 
Previous studies 10, 11 have symbolized Ptbased catalysts are the most efficient for 
48 
the ORR process, while the Ir or Rubased catalysts, for the OER, show promising 
49 
catalytic activity. However, the mentioned catalysts before contains the noble metals 
50 
so that the expensive cost is a fundamental obstacle for their largescale practical 
51 
application 12.
