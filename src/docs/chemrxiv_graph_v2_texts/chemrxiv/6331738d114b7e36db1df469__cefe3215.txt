Description:
A metal oxide used in solar cells, electrochemical capacitors, photocatalysis, and organic LEDs.

Text:
NiO is metal oxide which has applications in solar cells, electrochemical capacitors, 
photocatalysis, organic LEDs etc. Doping with cation like Cu and Li is done in NiO to 
overcome its high resistivity 13. Pure NiO is an insulator having band gap around 3.6
4 eV which gets converted into a ptype semiconductor by creating Ni2 vacancies by 
doping with cations. The band gap also gets reduced by this process. Room temperature 
ferromagnetism has been observed in Mn doped NiO nanoparticles synthesized by 
hydrothermal methods. Transition metal (Mn) doped NiO are Dilute Magnetic 
Semiconductors (DMS) which are used in spintronics devices increasing the processing 
speed and integration densities. An interaction between the host sp and Mn d levels take 
place in these cases.
