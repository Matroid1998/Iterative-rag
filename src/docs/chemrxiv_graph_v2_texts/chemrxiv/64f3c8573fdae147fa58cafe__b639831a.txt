Description:
An abundant and nontoxic metallic element used as a communal coating substance.

Text:
Additionally, the coating can maintain the electrical path and good 
physical contact between the electrode material and conductive carbon upon volume expansion and 
contraction. Metal oxides, such as TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, MoO3, and so forth, are some of the most common 
NMC coating materials.13 
Among a diverse range of oxides, Al2O3 stands out as a communal coating substance because it is an 
abundant and nontoxic metallic element. Through the interaction of LiPF6Al2O3, LiPO2F2 electrolyte 
additive is produced. The fluorine atoms in the LiPO2F2 form strong bonds with the lithium ions, which
