Description:
Used as a backbone for coupling growth factors and cytokines.

Text:
Hence, selfassembled monolayers, hydrogels and 
polyelectrolyte multilayers can capture or allow the coupling of BMP2 and other growth factors 
and cytokines, for example using hyaluronic acid backbones or histidine tags, to regulate cell 
adhesion and motility, neural stem cell maintenance, as well as osteoblast differentiation and bone 
regeneration 1619. Whilst these approaches are not directly aiming at mimicking the binding of 
growth factors by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), they were found to be effective and allow the
