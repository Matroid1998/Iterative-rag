Description:
A compound with a CC distance of 2.6 and is much more lipophilic.

Text:
Bicyclo2.2.2octane has a similar CC 
distance (2.6 ), but is much more lipophilic.14 Cubane, in turn, 
was recently shown to be unstable in the presence of transition 
metals,15 mechanochemistry, or heating.16 
In this work, we have rationally designed, synthesized, and 
characterized the ideal bioisoster of the parasubstituted phenyl 
ring  2oxabicyclo2.2.2octane (Figure 1).
