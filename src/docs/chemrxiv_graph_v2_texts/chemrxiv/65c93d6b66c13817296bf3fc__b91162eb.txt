Description:
Involves oxygen which reacts with the electrolyte or dimerizes during cycling.

Text:
Additionally, the O2 term also includes either oxygen which reacts with the 
electrolyte or which dimerizes during cycling610 and is unable to return to its original O2 state. Regardless of the exact identity of the O2 term, the irreversible loss of oxygen from the lattice 
will modify the electrochemicallyactive redox couples1116, lower the cell voltage11, and 
contribute to cation disordering within the crystalline lattice through vacancy (Schottky) defect 
pairs11,12,17. We note that Eq. (1) considers the fully lithiated (i.e. discharged) material, and thus a 
fully lithiated material which has experienced oxygen loss over cycling will exhibit a reduced 
TM oxidation state compared to that of the pristine material. At intermediate points within the 
chargedischarge cycle, the charge compensation for lost oxygen will vary.
