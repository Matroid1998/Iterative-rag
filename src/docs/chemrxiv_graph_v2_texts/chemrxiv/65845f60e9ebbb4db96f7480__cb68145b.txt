Description:
An intermediate whose nucleophilicity is increased by the addition of a Lewis acid.

in 2008 (Scheme 1C).5 Although this latter example is 
chemoselective, the substrates are not readily available, require 
additional steps for the introduction of two different leaving 
groups7 and suffer from a lack of diversity. Herein, we propose to 
solve the question of regio and chemoselective double allylic 
substitutions from readily available alkenyl vicdiols using a 
sequential dual catalysis approach, in which each catalytic 
system will allow the introduction of a different nucleophile at 
will.8 
Taking inspiration from the work of Borhans group on diol 
activation,9 we imagined that alkenyl vicdiols could be activated 
by trimethyl orthoacetate to form a cyclic orthoester intermediate 
(Scheme 1D). The addition of a Lewis acid would exacerbate the 
nucleophilicity of the orthoester intermediate, facilitating the first 
allylic substitution.
