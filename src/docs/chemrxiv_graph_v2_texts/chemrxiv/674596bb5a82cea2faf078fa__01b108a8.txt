Description:
A novel hybrid inorganic-organic ionic plastic crystal with barocaloric and structural properties.

Text:
Ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) have thus
far been explored mostly as solidstate electrolytes due to the large ionic conductivity
of the plastic crystalline phase 12. In this work, we seek to understand the barocaloric
and structural properties of the novel hybrid inorganicorganic IPCs, choline2CoCl4
and choline2ZnCl4. Choline, besides being a essential nutrient and basis for neuro
transmitter production 13, is a quaternary ammonium ion which readily forms plastic
crystalline salts with a variety of counter ions 14 as a result of its approximate glob
ular shape. Thus far, several choline metal halides compounds such as cholineFeCl4
14, choline3CuCl4Cl 15, choline4Cu4Cl10O 15 and cholineSnCl3 16 have
been reported.
