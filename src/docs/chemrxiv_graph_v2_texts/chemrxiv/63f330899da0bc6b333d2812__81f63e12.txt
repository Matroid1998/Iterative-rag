Description:
Has an ionization energy of 13.8 eV.

In this case summing
over atomic contributions therefore yields unphysical re
sults, in particular when extrapolating to systems that
are larger than the ones contained in the training set. From an ML perspective, the summation of atomic
contributions is simply one of many possible pooling
functions.2123 For example, when taking the average in
stead of the sum, predictions remain constant as the sys
tem size is scaled.24 Average pooling is therefore often
used as the default pooling function for intensive prop
erties. Unfortunately, average pooling can still yield un
physical results, particularly when the target property is
localized and the system has low symmetry. To illustrate this, consider a model trained on the
ionization energies (IEs) of isolated monomers of water
(12.6 eV) and CO2 (13.8 eV).
