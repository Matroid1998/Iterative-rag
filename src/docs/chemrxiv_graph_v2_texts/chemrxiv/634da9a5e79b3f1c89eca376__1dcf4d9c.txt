Description:
Complex synthesis, especially for releasing ones, hinders the rollout of versatile technology.

This socalled clicktorelease approach was applied to enable site
specific and traceless drug release upon TCOtetrazine ligation.20, 21 The fast reaction kinetics 
and click and release capability of the TCOtetrazine adduct opens up countless possibilities 
for novel applications in drug release and beyond. However, the complex synthesis of TCOs 
especially of the releasing ones  prevents the rollout of this versatile technology towards novel 
applications. In 2016 Rossin et al.
