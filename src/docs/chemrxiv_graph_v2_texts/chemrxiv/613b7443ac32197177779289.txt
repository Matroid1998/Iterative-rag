Description:
A component of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that allows lithium transport while protecting the electrolyte from degradation.

Understanding and controlling the chemical
degradation of liquid electrolytes is key to en
hancing the durability of lithiumion batteries
(LIBs). Even inside its electrochemical stabil
ity window, the electrolyte can reduce near the
anode during charging. This initiates a cas
cade of reactions and culminates in the irre
versible growth of a passivation layer, the solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI).1 This layer is com
posed of various inorganic and organic species2
that contain lithium. The resulting capacity
loss can be 10 in the rst chargedischarge cy
cle and increases throughout the batterys life
time.3
The SEI is electronically insulating but ion
ically conducting and protects the electrolyte
from further degradation while allowing lithium
transport.
