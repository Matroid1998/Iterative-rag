Description:
Organically modified silicas (ORMOSILs) doped with different chemical species, used in biocatalysis and advanced functional coatings.

Furthermore, as shown in the 
subsequent sections, organosilicaentrapped catalytic materials 
actually enable new reactions that are not possible with other 
catalytic materials. The term organosilica above refers to 
organically modified silicas (ORMOSILs)10 doped with different 
chemical species, a truly versatile class of functional materials 
whose commercial applications today span from biocatalysis11 
through advanced functional coatings.12
