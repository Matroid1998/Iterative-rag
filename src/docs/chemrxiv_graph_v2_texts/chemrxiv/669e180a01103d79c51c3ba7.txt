Solidstate batteries (SSBs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing energy storage due to their 
potential for high theoretical energy densities. 1 This technology offers significant advantages over 
traditional lithiumion batteries, including enhanced current density, faster charging rates, a wider 
operational voltage window, and improved safety  characteristics that are particularly attractive for 
electric vehicles and other demanding applications. 2 
However, a key challenge in developing highperformance SSBs lies in achieving a balance between 
maximizing energy density and enabling fast charging rates within composite electrodes. High energy 
density is achieved by incorporating a highvolume fraction of energydense active materials (AM) in 
the composite electrode. This creates impeded electronic conductive pathways, so carbon additives 
are incorporated to enhance the electronic conductivity.
