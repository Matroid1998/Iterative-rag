Description:
A versatile reagent containing cyano, active methylene, carbonyl, amido, and hydrazino groups, capable of acting as a nucleophile or electrophile.

Text:
Cyanoacetohydrazide is a versatile reagent as it contains five different 
functional groups ( cyano, active methylene, carbonyl, amido and hydrazino 
groups ) . Some of them could act as a nucleophile or as an electrophile. Also they 
could act in pairs as a bidentate reagent affording several probabilities . the 
predominance of which depends on the reaction conditions and the other reactants. 2 
Moreover, the versatility of this reagent could be extended to form condensed 
heterocycles via the involvement of more than two centers in the reaction course . 1

 In addition, cyanoacetohydrazide could be easily self  cyclized to afford a new 
versatile reagent namely 3amino5pyrazolone, which has extensive use in the 
synthesis of condensed pyrazoles1.

 This beside the simplicity of its preparation from cheap chemicals and in good 
yield renders it a good precursor in heterocyclic synthesis from both the theoretical

 These facts made us interested to review this subject here, however, the 
behavior of cyanoacetohydrazide which doesnt lead to heterocycles will be 
dropped. The reviewed reactions were classified according to the active centers of 
cyanoacetohydrazide involved. Accordingly, they are divided into the following 
classes 
a  Heterocycles obtained via the utility of functional groups No. 1, 2 ( The cyano 
and methylene groups . )
