Description:
A chemical element used in the design of moleculesized objects with magnetic memory effects.

MNMs are 
moleculesized objects with magnetic memory effects governed by quantum mechanics.610 They are 
strongly believed to revolutionize magnetic information storage, but at the moment do not have any real
world applications, as their performance is limited by low blocking temperatures and quantum tunneling 
of magnetization (QTM).11 Current trends in the design of MNMs12, 13 were ignited by the discovery of 
terbium doubledecker TbPc2 (Pc  phthalocyanine dianion)14 and were fueled by the seminal 
perspective of Rinehart and Long.15 Design principles focus on the precise control of the coordination 
sphere of a single lanthanide center in order to maximize the easyaxis magnetic anisotropy of the complex 
and to limit the spinlattice relaxation rates.1619 While this approach led to several breakthroughs, 
including the observation of the magnetic hysteresis loop of molecular origin above the liquid nitrogen 
barrier for dysprosocenium6, 7 and magnetic field control of the magnetization blocking barrier,20 it appears 
to be reaching its limit as the proposed modifications were not as successful as expected.21, 22 
The original approach to MNMs was based on designing multinuclear systems with strong 
magnetic superexchange, where several paramagnetic centers are glued together by bridging ligands to 
form a highspin molecule.
