Description:
Influences the optical properties of photocatalytic materials.

Text:
Nitrogen, with its 
higher electronegativity compared to carbon, introduces electronrich sites in the structure of the 
material, which can alter its electronic properties 4. Nitrogen doping has been shown to enhance 
the light absorption capabilities of semiconductors, particularly in the visible light range 5. This 
is achieved through the creation of new energy levels within the material, which lowers the band 
gap, allowing for more efficient photon absorption. Additionally, nitrogen doping can modify the 
charge carrier dynamics, promoting charge separation and reducing recombination rates, which 
are crucial for improving the efficiency of photocatalysts in HER 6. These modifications 
ultimately contribute to a materials increased photocatalytic activity under visible light. Similarly, the incorporation of oxygen into organic molecules can also influence the optical 
properties of photocatalytic materials 7.

Description:
Has strong electronegativity and can donate electron density to surrounding conjugated systems, enhancing absorption properties and solubility in nonpolar solvents.

Text:
The oxygen atom in the organic material has a strong 
electronegativity, which can donate electron density to the surrounding conjugated systems 8. This electrondonating ability can lower the materials band gap, enhancing its absorption 
properties and allowing for the absorption of light in the visible or nearinfrared regions. In 
addition to improving absorption, such functional groups can enhance the solubility of the material 
in nonpolar solvents, facilitating better dispersion and interaction with reactants in photocatalytic 
processes. By modulating the electron density and altering the molecular orbitals, the oxygen can 
significantly tune the optical and electronic properties of materials, making them more suitable for 
photocatalytic HER 9. The importance of photocatalysts in the context of clean energy and environmental sustainability 
cannot be overstated.
