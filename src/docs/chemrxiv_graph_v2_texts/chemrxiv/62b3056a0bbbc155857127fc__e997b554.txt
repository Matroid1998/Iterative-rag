Description:
Exhibits high stability under physiological conditions when caged.

Text:
Depending on the structure of the 
Tz and the cleavable TCO we observed up to 96 release after 
2 hours, while achieving high stability of the caged phenol under 
physiological conditions, as demonstrated by the design of a 
bioorthogonal prodrug with 700fold reduced cytotoxicity.
