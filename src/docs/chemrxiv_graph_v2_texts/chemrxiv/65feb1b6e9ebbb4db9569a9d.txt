Description:
A van der Waals material exhibiting single layer ferromagnetism.

Text:
The first reports of single layer ferromagnetism
in the van der Waals (vdW) materials CrI3
1
and Cr2Ge2Te6
2 have sparked intensive efforts
to realise the potential offered by two dimen
sional magnetic materials for both the explo
ration of fundamental physics and the creation
of new modalities for information technology.3
The most widely studied families of vdW mag
nets are highly symmetric and as such typi
cally possess collinear orderings.1,4 The ability
of more complex noncollinear magnetic order to
generate new functional properties5 is demon
strated by one of the few exceptions to this,
NiI2, for which there is evidence of spintexture
induced electrical polarisation6 and predictions
of skyrmion phases7. Rational
design
of
these
complex,
non
collinear spin textures in vdW magnets remains
an open challenge.
