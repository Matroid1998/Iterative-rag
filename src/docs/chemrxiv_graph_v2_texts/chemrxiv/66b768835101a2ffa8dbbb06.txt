Systems with rich structural chemistry and geometrical possibilities.

Text:
Polyiodides have long1,2 been a classic among scientifically challenging systems for chemists 
and physicists alike. Structural chemistry and geometrical possibilities displayed by 
polyiodides are particularly rich.3,4 To such a richness subtends complexity even the simplest 
of polyiodides, I3, was immediately recognized as an anion defying the octet rule. The apparent 
violation of octet rule has led to a mainstream explanation of polyiodides as hypervalent species 
and has played a pivotal role in the understanding of, andor constitutes a prime example of, 
threecenterfourelectron (3c4e) bonds.57 

On the other hand, polyiodides with a larger number of atoms in the chain than I3 also possess 
interesting alternation in terms of bond lengths, with many II bonds(?) contacts(?) interactions(?

)8 that fall in an intermediate region between single covalent (2c2e bonds, like in 
I2) bonds and supramolecular interactions, which are, nevertheless, strongly directional.3,4 For 
this very reason, polyiodides have been a prime crucible for the elaboration of novel concepts, 
in general, in inorganic, physical, and also supramolecular chemistry. In the latter realm, 
namely, secondary bonds9,10 and halogen bonds11 (and actually further models in between)1214 
are here of special relevance. To that end, polyiodides have been generally approached with a 
reductionist approach, dismantling superior species in terms of complexes of the I2, I, and I3 
reassuring basic building blocks, often via an II experimental distancebased approach to 
differentiate them in covalently, secondaryhalogen, and nonbonded fragments.3,1517
