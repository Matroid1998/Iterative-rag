Ligand charge density and degree of hydrophilicity have
a major impact on the fate of MPC within the cellular enviroment..815 The surface charge
and hydrophilicity of the protecting layer of MPCs influence their solubility and circulation
time in the bloodstream.16
In recent years, MPCs have emerged as potential drug carriers for the treatment of various
tumors.17,18 The major concern in short peptide or proteinbased therapeutics is they often
get degraded or proteolyzed in the physiological environment. MPCs prevent the degradation
of loaded drugs and improve therapeutic efficiency.1921 Arora et al. fabricated recombinant
protein PTEN and PEGylated silver nanoclusters as tracking agents of therapeutic protein
delivery agents for tumor cell lines.22 Xia and coworkers developed polypeptidemodified
