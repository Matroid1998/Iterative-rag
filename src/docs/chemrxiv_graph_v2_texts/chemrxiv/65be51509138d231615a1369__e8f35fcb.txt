Description:
A phenolic VOC emitted during biomass burning that produces SOA upon oxidation by O3.

Thermal desorption (TD) techniques are widely used to determine both of 
79 
these properties. TD techniques coupled with particle sizing instruments are often used to 
80 
determine the volatility of SOA, and TD techniques coupled with mass spectrometers are often 
81 
used to determine both volatility and chemical composition.1120 To interpret TD measurements, 
82 
information on the thermal stability of SOA components is needed.18 Several previous studies have 
83 
investigated the thermal stability of SOA components.18,19,2128 However, no studies have 
84 
investigated the thermal stability of catechol  O3 SOA. Catechol (Fig. S1) is a phenolic VOC 
85 
emitted during biomass burning,1,2 and it produces SOA upon oxidation by O3.6,7 
86 
To interpret results from TD measurements, information is also needed on the viscosity of 
87 
SOA when heated.

Description:
A compound involved in the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) through ozonolysis.

Text:
This method worked as 
101 
expected for farnesene SOA.41 However, when attempting to measure the temperaturedependent 
102 
viscosity of SOA generated by the ozonolysis of catechol, surprisingly, the volume of the SOA 
103 
increased when heated to mild temperatures (3652 C). 104 
Here, we focus on the unique physical and chemical properties of catechol  O3 SOA when 
105 
heated to mild temperatures (3652 C). We used an optical microscope to monitor the change in 
106 
size and morphology during heating of the SOA to mild temperatures (3652 C). To better 
107 
understand the optical microscope results and the thermal stability of the components, we used 
108 
three different mass spectrometry techniques to measure the composition of the gas and particle 
109 
phase before, during, and after heating.
