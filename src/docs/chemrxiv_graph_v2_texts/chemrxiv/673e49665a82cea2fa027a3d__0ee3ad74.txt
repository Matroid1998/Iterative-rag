Description:
A two-particle system with electron interactions in the ground and first excited states.

This approach still serves
as the foundation for a more comprehensive de
scription, incorporating the mixing of virtually
excited states of the constituent electrons.2,3
Practically, exact numerical solution for the
ground state has been obtained first by Koos
and Wolniewicz.4,5
Recently, we have solved exactly the ex
tended HeitlerLondon model, accounting for
allelectron interactions in the ground and first
excited states of the H2 twoparticle system
with the concomitant inclusion of contraction
of the 1sorbitals in the total wave function.69
The crucial feature of this exact solution is the
derivation of a simple and analytic form of the
twoparticle wave function.
