Description:
Introduced into organic structures to improve electronic properties and stability of photocatalysts.

The charge 
carrier dynamics, such as efficient charge separation and transfer, are optimized through the careful 
design of organic materials, allowing for better hydrogen production rates 10. Furthermore, 
heteroatom doping, such as introducing nitrogen or sulfur into the organic structure, has been 
shown to significantly improve the electronic properties and the stability of the photocatalysts, 
enabling longterm hydrogen evolution without significant degradation 11. Despite their promising properties, organic photocatalysts face several challenges that hinder their 
efficiency in HER 1215. One major issue is the low stability of many organic materials under 
harsh photocatalytic conditions, particularly in aqueous environments 16. These materials are 
susceptible to photocorrosion, which can reduce their lifetime and effectiveness over time.
