Description:
Oxidized platinum catalysts slow down the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Text:
Notably, the presence of siteblocking species3,12,13 and parasitic reactions leading
to mixed potentials.14 It has been shown that the ORR indeed proceeds more slowly on
oxidized platinum catalysts.15,16 Similarly, it has been shown that specific intermediates can
participate in nonelectrochemical reactions17 such as the hydrolysis of Ofurther reducing
the efficiency of the system. It is increasingly evident that the general solution to the ORR
