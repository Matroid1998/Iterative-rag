Description:
Can perform oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in strongly acidic electrolytes at low current densities.

Text:
showed that Co3O4 can perform OER over several days in 
strongly acidic electrolytes, albeit at low current densities, using 
a threeelectrode cell.3 In terms of practical applicability, 
MnO2 was used to operate a PEM setup for 400 h at 
10 mA cm2.4 When 100 mA cm2 was applied, the system shut 
down after 8 h, which was attributed to extensive Mn leaching 
and calls for the need to stabilize the noble metalfree OER 
catalyst further. One strategy to achieve higher stabilization is the expansion to 
multinary compositions.

Description:
A spinel lattice that can incorporate Mn to extend catalyst lifetime during acidic OER.

Text:
This method forms thermodynamically 
more stable alloys or bonds by adding elements that can alter 
electronic structures and act as stabilizing additives.5 The 
incorporation of Mn into the spinel lattice of Co3O4 can extend 
the catalyst lifetime by two orders of magnitude without 
compromising any activity during acidic OER. This effect was 
attributed to the formation of a stable MnO bond, suppressing 
dissolution.6 Chong et al. even demonstrated a La and Mn
doped cobalt spinel OER catalyst that was able to operate at 
current densities of 200 mA cm2 within a PEM setup for 100 h.7
