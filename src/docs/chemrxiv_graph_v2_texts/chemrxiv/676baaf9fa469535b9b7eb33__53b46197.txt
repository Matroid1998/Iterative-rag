man intuition, and a lack of quantitative and systematic
procedures to do so has hampered progress in this field. In this work, an approach based on the least abso
lute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 9, 10
is proposed for quantitative CALPHAD model selection. LASSO is a regression technique that performs both vari
able selection and regularization in order to enhance the
prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting
model. The LASSO method assumes that the coefficients
of the linear model are sparse, meaning that few of them
are nonzero, which is consistent with the criteria for
CALPHAD model selection. We specifically demonstrate its utility for thermody
namic modeling of metal oxides for thermochemical hy
drogen (TCH) production.
