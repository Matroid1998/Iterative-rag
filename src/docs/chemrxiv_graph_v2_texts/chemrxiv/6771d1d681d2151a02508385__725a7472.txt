Description:
Reacts with Rh(II) to form Rh(III)H and a silyl radical.

trial chemical transformations thus generally proceed via 
successive uni and bimolecular reaction steps.4, 5 In the 
case of catalytic radical hydrosilylation reaction, an initial 
encounter between catalyst and silane leads to the for
mation of a free silyl radical, which then reacts with an ole
fin in a separate reaction step (Figure 1B). For Rh(II) por
phyrin catalysis, the difference in Gibbs free energy be
tween the reagents (silane and Rh(II)) and the products 
(Rh(III)H and silyl radical) is calculated to be 25.5 
kcalmol1 (Figure S69).

Description:
Can be assembled with an olefin into a transition state for direct radical transfer.

Text:
However, for hydrogen atom trans
fer (HAT) to take place, two molecules need to associate into 
a transition structure which results in energy penalty due to 
the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom 
that corresponds to approximately 10 kcalmol1.68 A cata
lyst that is able to assemble a silane and an olefin into a tran
sition state for direct radical transfer with an energy input 
of less than 25.5  10  35.5 kcalmol1 would thus permit a 
more energyefficient transformation. Such a transition 
state would need to be assembled in a stepwise fashion to 
limit the entropic penalty.
