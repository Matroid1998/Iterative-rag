Description:
Participates in electrochemical reactions like the hydrogen evolution or oxidation reaction.

Electrochemical reactions that involve the transfer of multiple electrons, such as the oxygen evolution or reduction reaction 
27 
(OERORR), and the hydrogen evolution or oxidation reaction (HERHOR) are essential for a wide range of energy conversion and 
28 
storage applications, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, and batteries, as well as in the electroplating, water treatment, and 
29 
chemical synthesis industries e.g., the chloralkali process. Since the transfer of multiple electrons in one elementary step is very 
30 
unlikely, as discussed by Guidelli et. al. 1, the transfer of multiple electrons implies that multiple electrochemically active 
31 
elementary steps take place sequentially.
