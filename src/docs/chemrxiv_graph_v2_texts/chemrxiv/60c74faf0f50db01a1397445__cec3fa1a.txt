Description:
Has high scattering power and forms solid I2 in microporous carbon.

Text:
In situ small and wideangle Xray scattering (SAXSWAXS) is 
23 
sensitive to concentration changes and structural arrangements of molecules and ions in the nanoporous 
24 
system2831. Given the high scattering power of all iodine species (I, I3, I5, I2), in situ SAXSWAXS data 
25 
should provide rich kinetic and structural information. However, the complexity induced by the multiphase 
26 
character of these systems makes the SAXS data analysis highly challenging28. 27 
Here, we show that I oxidation in microporous carbon (pore size  2 nm) produces solid I2, which can reach 
28 
pore fillings of at least 30  and which in the iodide electrolyte partly dissolves into I3 and I5. The latter are 
29 
responsible for selfdischarge via shuttling.

Description:
Forms solid deposits and undergoes structural evolution in carbon nanopores.

Text:
In situ Raman and ex situ ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectroscopy 
30 
confirm I2, I3 and I5 during positive polarization and their reduction into I during negative polarization. In 
31 
situ SAXSWAXS data show that a majority of these species is confined to the carbon nanopores. Combined 
32 
with stochastic modeling, in situ SAXS quantifies the amount of solid iodine deposit and visualizes its 
33 
structural evolution in the pores. Based on the derived reaction mechanism, we show that high capacity with 
34 
low selfdischarge requires a small concentration of mobile polyiodides and a large fraction of immobile iodine 
35 
deposits. 36
