Description:
Tetrahedra in zeolites that can be replaced by AlO4.

Aluminosilicates are industrially indispensable materials with a farreaching global 
commercial importance. Besides their more mundane use in construction materials and 
ceramics, their porous forms, most notably zeolites,1 represent the backbone of industrial 
heterogeneous acid catalysis. Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate 
networks where some of the SiO4 tetrahedra are replaced by AlO4, necessitating 
charge compensation by a loosely bound cation in the pore space. Protonation gives rise 
to wellunderstood intraframework Brnsted acid sites of the Si(2OH)Al type,2 which 
were in the past believed to be responsible for all the catalytic properties of these 
materials.
