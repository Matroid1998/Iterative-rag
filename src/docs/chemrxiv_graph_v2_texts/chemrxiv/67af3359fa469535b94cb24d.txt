Description:
A class of nitrogen-rich heterocycles known for their high electron deficiency.

Text:
Heptazines (see Scheme 1) are a unique family of nitrogenrich aromatic fused tricyclic aza
arenes. They are of interest because of their remarkable photocatalytic properties,17 but also 
because they have been shown to be efficient emitters for organic light emitting diodes 
(OLEDs).810 Their high electron deficiency situates them between triazines11 and tetrazines,12
14 the two most investigated classes of nitrogenrich heterocycles.
