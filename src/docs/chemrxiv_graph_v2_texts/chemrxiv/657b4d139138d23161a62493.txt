The exploration of eunicellane diterpenoids began in 1968 when the group of Prof. 
45 
Carl Djerassithe Father of the pill, isolated a diterpenoid named eunicellin from 
46 
the Mediterranean gorgonian Eunicella stricta1 (Supplementary Figure S1). 47 
Eunicellinbased compounds are characterized by a distinctive 6,10bicyclic carbon 
48 
skeleton and exhibit a range of intriguing bioactivities, including cytotoxicity, anti
49 
inflammation, antibacterial, or antifouling properties24. Take a notable example 
50 
eleutherobin5,12,13, discovered from marine corals, demonstrated significant potency 
51 
comparable to paclitaxel in inducing tubulin polymerization and has been subjected to 
52 
clinical research (Supplementary Figure S1).
