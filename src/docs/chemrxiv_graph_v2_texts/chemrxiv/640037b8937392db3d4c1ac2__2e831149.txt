TEMPO radical10 (T) or some of its derivatives,11 which have
shown to be relevant in many fields of molecular science such as
controlled radical polymerisation,12 spin labeling,13 and redox
reactions.14 T can accept an OHO hydrogen bond from its asso
ciated hydroxylamine TEMPOH (TH). This complex THT (Fig. 1,
top) undergoes hydrogen atom transfer to the formally equivalent
THT structure through a barrier which is expected to be rather
high15 due to the steric hindrance of T and TH. The sterically hindered hydroxylamine TH is known as an anhy
drous crystalline solid16 and as a crystal containing one water for
every three TH units17.
