Description:
Formed through the oxidation of cyclic amine followed by hemiaminal formation.

Text:
One approach is nucleophilic substitution of quaternary 
ammonium salts, von Braun type reactions (Figure 1C).28,29 
This protocol was recently improved by using chlorofor
mates,30 or difluorocarbene3132 as more competent reagents. This transformation even facilitates the total synthesis of com
plex alkaloids33,34. Additionally, BAr3catalyzed ring opening 
has recently emerged as another approach exploiting ammoni
um intermediates.3536 Another traditional example is the a
oxidation of cyclic amine followed by hemiaminal(ether) for
mation, where the resulting aldehyde further undergoes func
tionalization 
via 
oxidation 
and 
decarboxylative 
processes.8,11,3744 These oxidative approaches have recently 
been highlighted by a series of elegant works from the Sar
pong group.8,1113,45
