Description:
Crystalline nanoporous materials widely produced in the chemical industry.

Text:
Zeolites are a family of natural and artificial porous aluminosilicates that rank among the most 
widelyproduced crystalline nanoporous materials in the chemical industry, where they are used in 
particular for their active role in catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Computational modelling 
plays a key role in understanding their fundamental properties, linking their physical and chemical 
behaviour at the macroscopic scale to their structure and dynamics at the atomic scale. With this goal, 
different levels of chemical description have been used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 
zeolites, ranging from classical interatomic potentials  with low accuracy but high transferability  
to firstprinciples or ab initio schemes based on Density Functional Theory (DFT)  which feature 
high accuracy along with high computational expense.
