Allsolidstate fluorideion batteries (ASSFIBs) are a promising candidate for postlithiumion 
battery technologies. Many possible combinations of conversionbased anode and cathode 
materials could outperform current lithiumion batteries in terms of gravimetric capacity and 
volumetric energy density 1. However, conversionbased materials suffer from rapid capacity 
fading and bad rate capability due to high volume change and large overpotentials associated 
with the reorganization of the crystal structure upon conversion 2. Therefore, intercalation
based materials as they are also employed in current stateoftheart lithiumion batteries 
appear to be the way forward to achieve high cyclic stability for ASSFIBs. Earlier publications on intercalation cathode materials for fluoride ion batteries have highlighted 
fluorination of the conductive carbon additive as a parasitic side reaction leading to rapid 
deterioration of the cell performance 3.
