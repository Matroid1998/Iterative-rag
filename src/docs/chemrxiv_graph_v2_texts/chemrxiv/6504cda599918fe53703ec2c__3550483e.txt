Text:
Although anomeric amide chlorinat
ing reagent 6 and Palauchlor have the same NCl bond length (both 
1.73 , longer than 1.66  for TCCA49 and 1.69  for NCS50), the con
version of 14 to 14Cl is calculated to be more energetically favorable by 
a factor of 102.7 (G  3.75 kcalmol) using 6 (Figure 3A), which 
is in accord with experimental findings. To gain deeper insight into this 
higher reactivity, DFT calculations of the NCl bond breaking energy 
(from the ground state to the corresponding anion and Cl) for both re
agents was performed.

Description:
Requires more energy for bond breaking compared to reagent 6.

Text:
Calculations indicate that this bond breaking 
event is significantly uphill for both reagents, but reagent 6 requires 25 
kcalmol less energy for bond breaking than Palauchlor, which means 6 
has a more active NCl bond (Figure 3B).
