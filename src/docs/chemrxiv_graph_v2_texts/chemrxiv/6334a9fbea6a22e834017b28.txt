Manganese oxides are a uniquely diverse class of materials both structurally and chemically. Over 30 Mn (oxy)(hydr)oxide minerals are known to form via natural processes with a wide range 
of possible crystal structures, Mn oxidation states, and intercalated ions.1 An even greater variety 
can be synthesized with simple laboratory methods.29 In nature, this rich assortment of structure 
and ion insertion chemistry plays a vital role in regulating biological1,10 as well as geochemical
