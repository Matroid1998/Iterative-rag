Description:
A piezoelectric material used in nanogenerators.

Text:
Nanogenerators (NGs) can directly harness local energy sources, such as from motion or 
mechanical stress, to power portable and wearable devices. They are therefore attractive 
alternatives to batteries. Applications of NGs include sensors, actuators and electromechanical 
convertors.1 NGs use a dielectric layer for charge accumulation, which is typically a piezoelectric 
material.2, 3 For NGs to be used in wearable electronics, flexibility is a key design parameter; 
however, existing piezoelectricbased NGs  that produce current ranging from nanoamperes to 
microamperes  are often made up of bulk ceramics like lead zirconate titanate (PZT) with limited 
flexibility.
