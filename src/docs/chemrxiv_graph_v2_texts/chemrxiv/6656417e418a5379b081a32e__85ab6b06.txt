Description:
Natural alkynes are often derived from fatty acids.

However, CuAAC is generally applicable only to terminal alkynes or to
specially designed, highlystrained internal alkynes.12 Many naturally derived alkynes are
internal alkynes with no ring strain, and are thus not amenable to CuAAC. According to
the Human Metabolome Database,13 at least 173 unique internal alkyne structures are, or
have the potential to be, a component of human metabolomes. These 173 internal alkynes
account for 80 of the 216 alkynecontaining structures in the HMDB. More than 70 of
the 173 are derived from plants or fungi. A large fraction of these come from a structurally
related family of 1,3diynes (Figure 1). Natural alkynes, especially the structural clade
highlighted in Figure 1b, are often derived from fatty acids, and frequently lack moieties
(amines, amides, carboxylic acids, etc.)
