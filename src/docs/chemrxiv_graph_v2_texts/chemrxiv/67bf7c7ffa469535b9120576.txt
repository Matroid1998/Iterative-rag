Zeolites are microporous, crystalline materials that are used in industrial separations1 and 
35 
catalysis2. While some occur naturally as minerals, the majority are synthesized using 
36 
hydrothermal processes, often requiring the presence of a highly specific organic structure 
37 
directing agent (OSDA) molecule to facilitate the crystallization of specific zeolite 
38 
frameworks3,4. OSDAs are crucial for selectively driving the synthesis of a particular 
39 
framework against other polymorphs, and also for influencing the density and distribution of 
40 
heteroatoms in the framework, such as the density and placement of aluminum in 
41 
aluminosilicate zeolites5,6, which act as Brnsted acid catalytic sites. The heteroatom 
42 
distribution then impacts the reactivity, selectivity and stability of zeolites in industrial and 
43 
environment applications5,7.

After decades of experimental efforts, about 1000 molecules have been reported in the 
46 
synthesis of under 270 known frameworks.8,9 Finding new OSDAs is key to both synthesizing 
47 
new zeolites and tuning the properties of known ones such as modulating the concentration or 
48 
positions of heteroatoms like aluminum.4,5 In particular, increasing SiAl ratios generally 
49 
improves the hydrothermal stability of zeolites for catalytic applications10, while lowering 
50 
SiAl ratios (i.e. below 5) increases their cationic exchange capacity, which is useful in 
51 
adsorption and catalytic processes requiring metalexchanged catalysts5.
