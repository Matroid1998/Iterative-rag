Undergo direct and selective conversion into fine chemicals.

In recent years, the direct and selective conversion of alkanes into fine chemicals has garnered 
significant attention within the scientific community.1,2 This surge in interest stems from a 
growing desire to introduce sp3character into organic molecules, which matches more with the 
3Dnature of protein targets, thereby enhancing their efficacy and reducing attrition rates.3,4 
Moreover, direct activation of aliphatic CH bonds allows practitioners to bypass the use of 
functionalized molecules, such as haloalkanes or organometallic reagents, enabling the direct 
use of feedstock materials into the latestage modification of drugs, agrochemicals, and 
materials.5,6 Notably, gaseous hydrocarbons stand out as the most abundant, atomefficient, 
and economically viable carbonbased feedstocks.
