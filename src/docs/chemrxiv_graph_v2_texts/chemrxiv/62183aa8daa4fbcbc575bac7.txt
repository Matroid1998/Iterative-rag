Description:
Mononuclear Fe active sites in enzymes can perform selective partial oxidation of substrates with strong CH bonds.

Direct methanetomethanol conversion with high selectivity remains a challenge1 in 
unlocking natural gas as a feedstock.2 Catalysts that can readily convert methane into methanol 
must be potent enough to activate the strong CH bonds of methane but also release methanol to 
facilitate catalyst turnover and avoid catalyst poisoning or methanol overoxidation.3, 4 Thus, the 
design of the optimal catalysts for methanetomethanol or similarly challenging reactions 
requires balancing inherent tradeoffs between activity, selectivity, and stability, motivating an 
exhaustive search over chemical space.5 Enzymes with mononuclear Fe active sites (e.g. TauD68 
or P4509, 10) have demonstrated the capability to perform selective partial oxidation of substrates 
with strong CH bonds, including methane. These enzymes have thus motivated the design of 
ligands1114 for synthetic systems, including both homogeneous1518 and heterogeneous1922 
catalysts.
