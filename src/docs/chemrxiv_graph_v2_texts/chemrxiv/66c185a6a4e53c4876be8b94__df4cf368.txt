Description:
A cubic system used to demonstrate PCT behavior in high-pressure, multielement interstitial hydrides.

Text:
However, PCT prediction becomes even
more difficult if a metal or alloy is open to multiple
species that can populate its interstitials (i.e., H and N)
or if the pressure range to be modeled is sufficiently high
that the pressure contribution to the enthalpy is non
negligible. Our goal is therefore to generally address both chal
lenges in a unified computational workflow so that PCT
behavior of highpressure, multielement interstitial hy
drides can be more rapidly predicted. We will demon
strate this for the cubic Lu(H, N, Va)3 system, but ex
pect its applicability to translate to other materials sci
ence domains relying on (highpressure) interstitial in
corporation in intermetallic alloy lattices. Modern ma
