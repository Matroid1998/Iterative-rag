Description:
Its catalytic activity is affected by weaker than expected binding energy.

Text:
Consider the example of platinum For a constant
EC, EO is about 2 eV weaker than what linear scaling
would predict. This weaker than expected binding affects
the catalytic activity of Pt, where it is considered weak
