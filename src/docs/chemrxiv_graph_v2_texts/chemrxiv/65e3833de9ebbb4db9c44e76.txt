The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates that nutrients impair 1541 of 
47 
assessed surface water area (including lakes, rivers, estuaries, etc.) in the United States.1 
48 
Phosphorus, specifically, is the limiting nutrient for harmful algal growth and eutrophication in 
49 
many freshwater ecosystems.2 To protect or restore US waters, states are adopting numeric water 
50 
quality criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus by identifying impaired water bodies and adjusting 
51 
effluent permits for water resource recovery facility (WRRF) to meet waterbodyspecific loadings.3 
52 
As of 2021, eight states had gained statewide phosphorus criteria for at least one waterbody 
53 
type, while another sixteen states had added numeric criteria for select waterbodies (headwaters, 
54 
wadeable streams, reservoirs requiring algicide, etc.

Description:
A nutrient whose removal or recovery is essential in wastewater treatment to protect natural waterbodies.

).4 To meet increasingly prevalent and 
55 
increasingly stringent effluent phosphorus limits to protect natural waterbodies, wastewater 
56 
treatment plants are in need of effective and costefficient technologies that reliably achieve 
57 
phosphorus removal or recovery. 58 
To date, commercialized tertiary wastewater treatment technologies for phosphorus 
59 
management have been limited to enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), chemical 
60 
polishing, and membranes.5 EBPR can be a lower cost among these options but cannot reliably 
61 
treat below 0.3 mgL1 total phosphorus.6 Though chemical polishing with coagulants (typically
