Description:
A pollutant that can increase the risk of respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and stroke.

Ambient air pollution is recognized by the World Health Organi
zation (WHO) as a major environmental risk to health 1. Exposure to
pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and
sulfur dioxide (SO2) can increase the risk of respiratory diseases, lung
cancer, and stroke. Despite this, in 2019, 99 of the worlds population
lived in areas where the WHO air quality guidelines were not met 2. However, the main cause of air pollutants is the combustion of fuels in
the transportation and industrial sectors, which makes emissions preva
lent and difficult to eliminate. This, combined with industrialization
and new environmental policies, drives the demand for sensor integra
tion in embedded systems and networks such as the Internet of Things
(IoT).
