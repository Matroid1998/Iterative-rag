have been made within homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis as well as photo and
electrocatalytic catalysis to address this challenge 3. Within efforts made towards finding
homogeneous catalysts, transition metal complexes (TMCs) have shown significant promise
due to their unique electronic properties and ability to coordinate with nitrogen molecules,
and they offer a promising avenue for catalyzing nitrogen fixation under milder conditions. Particularly complexes involving molybdenum, iron, cobalt, and vanadium, have been
