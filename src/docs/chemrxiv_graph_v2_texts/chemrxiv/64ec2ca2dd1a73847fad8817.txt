Description:
Groups that are effective at delocalizing electron density away from metal ions.

Text:
As silylsubstituted CpR ligands are more effective at delocalizing electron density away from 
metal ions over their alkylsubstituted counterparts,27,29,37 nonclassical Ln(II) Ln(CpR)3 anions are 
dominated by examples containing SiMe3 groups, though these still tend to readily decompose above
