TMDs
(WS2,
WSe2,
WTe2;
henceforth
collectively denoted as WX2) are important for appli
cations in catalysis 2325, optoelectronics 26, 27,
spintronics 28, 29, gas sensors 3032, antibacterial
activity 33, 34, etc. Moreover, there are a wide range
of methods available to synthesise these materials such
as chemical vapour deposition 3537, atomic layer
deposition 38, 39, and exfoliation 40.This makes
tungsten TMDs useful as engineering materials, rather
than just as simple model systems. Many technologies, including energy conversion and
electronics, are dependent on metals deposited onto
substrates. The resulting morphology of the metal on
the substrate determines the possible application of
metalsubstrate combinations 41.
