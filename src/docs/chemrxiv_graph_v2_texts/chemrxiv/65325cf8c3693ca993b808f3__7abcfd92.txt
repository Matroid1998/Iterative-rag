Description:
A copolymer that shows enhanced doping efficiency with superbase compounds compared to NDMBI.

Text:
There the polymer is
attacked by the trityl cation instead of a proton, followed by sub
sequent CT with a neighbouring polymer chain.17 Both Lewis
acid doping and electrophilic attack show remarkable efficiencies
of ptype doping, and avoid typical issues caused by molecular
dopants such as deterioration of film morphology. Very recently, a new ntype doping method using superbase
compounds was reported and shown to significantly enhance ef
ficiency in doping the molecular OSCs PCBM and N2200 copoly
mer, compared to molecular ntype doping with NDMBI.21 In
analogy to the protonation in Lewis acid doping, a deprotonation
of PCBM brought about by the superbase compound is believed
to occur, with subsequent CT between deprotonated PCBM and
intact PCBM entities.
