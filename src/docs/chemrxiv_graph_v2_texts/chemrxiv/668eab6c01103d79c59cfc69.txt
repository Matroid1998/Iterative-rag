Description:
A nucleic acid base involved in the formation of G-quadruplex structures.

Text:
Gquadruplexes (G4) are a class of nucleic acid secondary structure formed from
guanine rich nucleic acid sequences1 that have elicited much interest in recent years across 
many scientific disciplines due to their structural polymorphism,2 biological relevance,3
potential as therapeutic targets,4 catalysts5 and as the basis of functional nanodevices.6 G
