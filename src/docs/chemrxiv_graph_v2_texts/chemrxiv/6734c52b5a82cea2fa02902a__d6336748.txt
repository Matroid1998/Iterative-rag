Description:
Atoms transfer electrons to interstitial quasi atoms in a simplistic model.

Indeed, 
the calculated bandgap for this new phase of sodium, named NahP4, is 1.3 eV; therefore, sodium 
becomes a semiconductor under extreme compression (Ma et al., 2009). In fact, sodium becomes a high
pressure electride (HPE), as consequence of the reordering of the valence orbitals, which form 3(s)pd 
hybrid orbitals, whose overlap results in the formation of a multicentered bond and concomitant 
localization of electron density in interstitial sites (Racioppi, Storm et al., 2023). A more simplistic model 
has viewed the electrons as being transferred from the Na atom to socalled interstitial quasi atoms (ISQ) 
(Miao  Hoffmann, 2014). Though conceptually appealing, this model is not fully supported by detailed 
analysis of the electronic structure(Racioppi  Zurek, 2024). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024xwcv5 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000241741732 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
