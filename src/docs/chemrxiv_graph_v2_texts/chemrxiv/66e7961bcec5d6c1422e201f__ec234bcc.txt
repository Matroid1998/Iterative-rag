In 
41 
contrast, functionalised carbon in humid or aqueous environments are ubiquitous and thus 
42 
relevant in many systems. For example, the hydrophilic groups in lipid bilayers or DNA 
43 
strands11,12 as well as in hydrophilic polymer membranes13,14, graphene oxide (GO)based 
44 
membranes1519 or single atom catalysts20,21 all obtain carbonoxygen interfaces with water. 45 
All these examples exist in aqueous environments that contain cations. However, there is lack 
46 
of studies looking at the carbonoxygen interface with water in the presence of cations 
47 
despite its enormous fundamental and technological relevance. Hence, conceiving an AWC 
48 
study that can investigate the interfacial hydrogen network in functionalised carbon under 
49 
the presence of cations is highly desirable.
