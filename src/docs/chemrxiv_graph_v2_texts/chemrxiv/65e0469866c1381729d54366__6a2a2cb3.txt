Description:
An element used in alloying with magnesium to enhance corrosion resistance.

Corrosion susceptibility of biodegradable Magnesium (Mg) alloys in physiological Chlorine 
environment is a major limitation for its clinical applicability1. Magnesium as biomedical 
implant has numerous advantages due to its density, mechanical strength, and elastic 
modulus close to the natural bone properties 1. Mg is one of the most important bivalent ions 
associated with the formation of the biological apatite and shows direct influence on bone 
metabolism2. Alloying with elements like Al, Li, or Co has been reported to enhance the 
corrosion resistance of the Mg alloys. However, introducing these elements in the implant 
system could lead to chronic cytotoxic responses in the host system3,4. For example, the 
presence of aluminium exerts neurotoxic effects due to the generation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and free radicals5.
