Description:
Involved in stacking sequences categorized into P2, O3, P3, etc., indicating different layer stacking sequences.

Text:
According to the oxygen stacking sequence, they are further categorized into P2, O3, P3, etc., where the number 
indicates a two or threelayer stacking sequence of oxygen.4,5 

In the NaxTMO2 system, P2 and O3 are two of the most studied structures.
