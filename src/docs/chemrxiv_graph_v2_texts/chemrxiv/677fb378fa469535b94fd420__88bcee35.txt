Description:
Has the second optimal binding energy for the COOH intermediate in CO2 reduction.

Text:
For example, it can be used as an intermediate product for the further reduction to 
ethylene7,8 However, due to the high stability of CO2 and the requirement of electron and proton
transfers for its transformation, catalysts need to overcome the slow kinetics, yielding low 
overpotential and high product selectivity. Silver (Ag) has been the metal of choice as catalyst for the CO2RR to CO due to its high activity, 
selectivity,5 and drastically lower cost compared to gold (Au). Having the second optimal binding 
energy for the key intermediate of COOH, which is essential in the CO2RR process to CO, Ag is slightly 
less efficient than Au for CO2RR to CO.9 Even though Ag is not a CRM (critical raw material), its 
considerable cost is a burden for upscaling.

Description:
Used in Ag-based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR).

Text:
To facilitate the industrial application of the 
electrochemical CO2RR over Agbased catalysts, research efforts need to be directed towards the 
minimization of the amount of Ag in the catalytic system, while maintaining the overall activity and 
selectivity (i.e., increasing the mass activity), while ensuring industryrelevant manufacturing routes. Many studies focused on the effects of the catalyst particle size,10 morphology,11 nanostructuring,12
14support, alloying and porosity,15 on the CO2RR efficiency. However, synthetic processes to prepare 
the catalytic materials are often challenging and costly to scale up. Furthermore, materials were often 
tested in simple Hcells that are limited by the slow mass transfer of CO2 in the liquid electrolyte and 
are not relevant for future commercialization.
