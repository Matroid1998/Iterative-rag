Description:
A key element in the DAC carbon footprint and cost of CO2 capture.

Text:
Our prior analysis of a 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
process revealed that incorporating a sorbents capacity 
fade into the economic model significantly increases the 
predicted process cost and alters the recommended 
sorbent replacement times.29 These findings indicate that 
the details of a sorbents degradation, specifically the rate 
and form of capacity fade over time, are crucial to include 
when evaluating competing properties and comparing 
process costs for different sorbents. These gaps lead to the first two questions addressed in 
this work (1) How does sorbent degradation affect the 
DAC carbon footprint and cost of CO2 capture? (2) Do the 
capacity fade (loss) rate and form (e.g., linear, exponential) 
affect the optimal replacement time? To answer these, we 
developed a capacity fade economic model for DAC.
