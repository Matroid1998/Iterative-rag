Description:
Can be introduced between the chains of ZEO2, resulting in Interchain Expanded Zeolites.

Text:
ILEZ materials 
are interrupted frameworks rather than true zeolites because dangling SiR or SiOH groups remain in 
the final asmade and calcined materials, respectively.12,13 Very recently, we have reported the first 
case of a 1Dto3D topotactic condensation of a complex chain silicate zeolite precursor (ZEO2) into 
the extralarge pore ZEO3 zeolite, which was at that time the silica polymorph of lowest density ever 
reported.2 ZEO3 has a 3D system of pores open through rings containing 16, 14, and 14 tetrahedra 
(161414 membered ring, MR). Here we report that it is possible to introduce silicon between the 
chains of ZEO2, resulting in what we call Interchain Expanded Zeolites (IChEZ).
