Description:
Exhibits a larger distribution of distinct environments in unannealed materials with ill-defined metal-organic crosslinks.

Text:
of polymer linkers to the exterior of the MOCs does not significantly perturb the catalyst 
environment, which should facilitate predictable and direct translation of these formerly homogeneous 
catalysts to polyCATs.28 Additionally, this result provides strong evidence for the existence of well
formed MOC junctions within TEMPOpolyCAT, as the EPR spectrum for an unannealed material with 
illdefined metalorganic crosslinks clearly showed a larger distribution of distinct nitroxide environments 
(see Supporting Information section EPR Studies for details). Fig. 2. Analysis of the structure and reactivity of the TEMPOpolyCAT gel. a, Scheme and image showing the synthesis of the polyCAT
