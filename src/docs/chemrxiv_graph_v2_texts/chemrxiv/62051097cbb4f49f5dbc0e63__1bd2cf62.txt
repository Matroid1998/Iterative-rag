Description:
A promising semiconductor for solar cell up and downconverters.

Text:
Zinc oxide is one of the most promising semiconductors for solar cell up and downconverters 
because its cheap and appropriate host for lanthanides 1,2. The lanthanides atoms on ZnO 
surface can effectively convert UV and visible light into nearinfrared range where the cSi solar 
cells strongly absorb light 36. The light conversion can occur through nonradiative energy 
transfer from excited state of ZnO to the excited states of lanthanide ions with subsequent light 
emission in the infrared range 79. The energy transfer is quite an effective process resulting in 
the efficiency of up to 200 when quantum cutting takes place 10. A number of lanthanidedoped ZnO materials, such as composites, films, nanoparticles etc., has 
already been reported in literature 79,1113.
