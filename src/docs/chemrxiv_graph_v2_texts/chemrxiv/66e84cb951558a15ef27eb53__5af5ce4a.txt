Description:
A ligand used in thermal protocols for C(sp)O cross coupling reactions.

Text:
For example, Stradiotto and coworkers developed the first thermal protocol for C(sp)O cross
coupling reactions using organic bases in combination with the PAd2DalPhos as a ligand.22 The interplay between ligand and 
base is underscored by the success of coupling aliphatic alcohols with DBU, whereas BTPP is required for reactions with 
phenols.
