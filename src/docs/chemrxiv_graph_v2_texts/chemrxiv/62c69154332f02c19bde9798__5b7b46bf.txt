Description:
A perovskite material considered state-of-the-art in the design of new ferroelectric materials due to its desirable properties and tunability.

Discovery and development of new ferroelectric materials is 
important for the realisation of new memory storage 
technology, such as FERAM in flexible devices, soft robotics and 
wearable electronics. Perovskites, such as BaTiO3, have long 
been considered stateoftheart in design of new FE materials 
owing to desirable properties and tunability of their 
composition.1 Perovskites adopt the general formula ABX3, 
where a larger Asite cation occupies the cavities within a 
pseudocubic cornersharing network of BX6 octahedra. Substitutions on any of the three sites has been shown to result 
in remarkable changes in FE properties.
