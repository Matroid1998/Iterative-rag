Description:
Used as a catalyst in the reductive coupling of aryl (pseudo)halides.

Text:
The electrophilic nature of sterically hindered aryl halide has also been explored in the 
Catellani reaction by the groups of Zhou,16 Gu,10k Shi,17 and Cheng.18. Besides these redox
neutral synthesis of biaryls or related olefins, the groups of Yang19 and Watson20 succeeded in 
reductive coupling of two aryl (pseudo)halides under cobalt or nickel catalysis, respectively.
