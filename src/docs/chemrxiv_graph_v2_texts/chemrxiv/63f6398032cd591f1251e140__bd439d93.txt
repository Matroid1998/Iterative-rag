Description:
React with CO2 or COS in ROCOP to form polycarbonates or poly(monothiocarbonates).

Having 
gained 
prominence 
for 
the 
selective 
copolymerisation of CO2 with epoxides or 
oxetanes to polycarbonates, ROCOP cannot only 
make use of underutilized monomer feedstocks 
but also produce previously inaccessible polymer 
structures.1822 Taking this methodology to the 
arena of sulfurated polymers, ROCOP of carbonyl 
sulfide COS with epoxides or oxetane represents 
a wellestablished route to selectively yield 
poly(monothiocarbonates) (Figure 1(a)).2329 Yet 
this ROCOP requires specialised steel reactor set
ups to safely handle highly toxic, flammable and 
gaseous carbonyl sulfide as well as commercial 
access to high purity COS (which is for example 
currently not the case in Europe) limiting the utility 
of this ROCOP in standard research laboratories. Figure 1 Comparison of products formed during (a) (CO2 
or COS)(epoxide or oxetane) and (b) CS2(epoxide or 
oxetane) ROCOP.
