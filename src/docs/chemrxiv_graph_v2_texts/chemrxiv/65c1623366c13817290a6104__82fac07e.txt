Description:
Reactive groups that are prevented from crosslinking by PEG shielding until compression brings them together.

Text:
Both
systems begin as a crosslinked network and respond to
compression, strengthening several hundreds of kPa in
elastic
modulus
over
repeated
cycles. The
mechanosensitivity results from long PEG molecular
shielding groups grafted to the polymer backbone, which
prevent the reactive thiol groups from crosslinking until
compression brings them together. To date, the most successful method of creating synthetic
mechanosensitive polymers that undergo liquidtosolid
transition is by inserting weak bonds, mechanophores,
within polymer chains that are converted to an active
intermediate
in
response
to
force,
capable
of
strengthening the material1214. This work , in contrast,
uses
the
shielding
group
concept,
starting
with
uncrosslinked, shielded polymers that can undergo a
rapid liquidtosolid transition upon application of force.
