Description:
An antibiotic introduced in the 1940s that led to penicillinase-based resistance.

Text:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged in Staphylococcus aureus stepwise.1 
The introduction of penicillins such as penicillin G in the 1940s led to penicillinasebased 
resistance due to the blaZ and related genes. blaZ encodes penicillinase. Upon the 
introduction of penicillins that are resistant to penicillinases  such as methicillin and 
oxacillin  methicillinsusceptible strains (MSSA) gave way to MRSA when the bacterium 
acquired mecA. MRSA express both, penicillinbinding protein 2a (PBP2a) as well as 
penicillinases.1, 2 MRSA are, consequently, resistant to most lactams. Vancomycin  
once considered a drug of last resort  became the frontline therapy against MRSA,3 
giving rise to vancomycinintermediate resistant (VISA) strains.4 VISA isolates are often 
also resistant to lactams,5 making antimicrobials such as oxazolidinones (e.g., 
linezolid), and streptogramins (e.g., quinupristindalfopristin) frontline treatments.
