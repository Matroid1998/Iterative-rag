Description:
A nonnucleoside inhibitor identified for DNMT1.

Text:
Despite their high efficacy, nucleoside drugs suffer from undesirable 
pharmacokinetic profiles, chemical instability, and toxic side effects 11. Due to DNA methylation being a 
fundamental mechanism for gene regulation, the design and development of nonnucleoside DNMT 
modulators is a promising strategy for developing novel epigeneticbased therapies. Among the earliest non
nucleoside inhibitors identified for DNMT1 is ()epigallocatechin3gallate (EGCG) (ref) (Figure 1). This 
compound and other DNMT1 inhibitors sourced from natural origins have been subject to extensive review 
12,13. In epigenetic drug discovery, including DNMT1, efforts are increasing to design and analyze focused 
libraries of DNMT inhibitors. Our research group recently reported a comprehensive analysis of the chemical 
content, diversity, and chemical space coverage of eleven commercial epigeneticfocused libraries with over 
50,000 molecules.
