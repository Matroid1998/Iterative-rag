Description:
Critical for materials used in telecommunications, solar energy upconverters, high power lasers, lighting, LEDs, and permanent magnets.

The lanthanides are critical for many materials used in society. These are used in 
telecommunications,1 upconverters for solar energy2, high power lasers3, lighting (phosphors),4 
light emitting diodes,5 and permanent magnets.6 The rapidly increasing consumption of the 
lanthanides puts pressure on improving the extraction and recycling processes.7 While the 
lanthanide containing materials are solids, the preparation of the raw materials requires solution 
phase processes where our chemical understanding is poor.8 To improve our understanding of the 
solution chemistry of these elements, new tools are required to study them in this medium.
