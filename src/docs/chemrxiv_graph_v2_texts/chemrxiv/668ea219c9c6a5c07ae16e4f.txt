Description:
Present in nanozymes as iron-ion-based ligands that serve as active sites.

However, the advent of nano hydrogel nanozyme (8) and OC (Organiccompoundbased, mostly 
40 
for agricultural and ecofriendly) nanozyme (9,10) partially resolve these limitations These 
41 
nanozymes do not rely on inorganic nanostructures or catalysts but contain ironionbased ligands 
42 
as active sites generated simultaneously with nanoparticle formation. And the portion of iron ions 
43 
in these nanozymes is within an acceptable atomic ratio. Particularly, previous OC nanozymes 
44 
offer a complete onepot, partially cofactormimetic, homogenous nanozyme without any
