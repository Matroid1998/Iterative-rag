Description:
An ionic liquid with a melting point lower than 100Â°C, known for enhanced electrochemical stability.

Owing
to the complexity of battery systems and because many ana
lytical methods are not applicable for (in situ) studies of elec
trochemical systems, there is a demand for studies on well
dened model systems in order to understand the interactions
and reactions at different interfaces. In recent years, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as elec
trolytes has attracted increasing attention.24 Ionic liquids,
which are dened as salts with a melting point lower than
100C, offer a variety of advantages, including an en
hanced electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, there are
reports that ILs decompose at low electrode potentials.57
One of the most studied ILs is N,Nbutylmethylpyrrolidinum
bis(triuoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPTFSI).

Description:
A compound studied for its interaction with metallic Li on a HOPG substrate.

Text:
We rst present and discuss the results of systematic XPS
measurements on the interaction of a multilayer lm of molec
ularly adsorbed BMPTFSI lm a HOPG substrate with in
creasing amounts of metallic Li evaporated on top of it (sec
tion II A). Next we apply DFT calculations to explore the
thermodynamic stability of possible decomposition products
and kinetic barriers for their formation (section II B and sec
tion II C). Subsequently, we compute core level binding en
ergies of probable reaction products and compare these with
the experimental ndings in the XPS experiments to unam
biguously identify the products and longliving intermediates
