Description:
A heptamethine dye reported to degrade in the presence of physiological nucleophiles or in simple aqueous solutions.

Text:
In particular, the planar conjugated sys
tems in heptamethine dyes result in strong tendency to
wards nonemissive aggregation with little solubility in 
water, which requires the modification with hydrophilic 
groups andor steric bulk to allow their imaging in aque
ous conditions.912 Additionally, the stability of heptame
thine dyes can introduce complexity in their imaging ap
plications. For example, heptamethine dyes are photo
bleached relatively fast under illumination compared to 
other family of fluorophores,13,14 and many, including ICG, 
have been reported to degrade in the presence of physio
logical nucleophiles or even in simple aqueous solu
tions.1012,15,16 While these limitations can be partially over
come by using formulation methods, the heterogeneous 
nature of formulation brings about batchtobatch varia
tions as well as potential in vivo instability.
