Required in stoichiometric amounts to activate C(sp3)H bonds in aliphatic systems.

1a). Recently, our group3234 and others35,36 have developed photocatalytic procedures for the activation of 
C(sp3)H bonds to carbanion (equivalents) without the need of stoichiometric organometallic reagents. However, only C(sp3)H bonds in benzylic32,34 and allylic position35,36 or in position to two sulfur 
atoms could so far be activated,33 while C(sp3)H bonds in aliphatic systems require a stoichiometric 
amount of chromium.37 In spite of recent advances in this field, the regioselective generation of a 
carbanion intermediate in the presence of more than one potentially reactive site, using either this 
photocatalytic approach or a classical deprotonation, remains underdeveloped. The latestage transformation of pharmaceutically active compounds is of prime importance and 
continues to be in demand for novel organic transformations.
