Description:
A motif that contributes to affinity and interacts with proteins through oxygen contacts.

Text:
In line with the prevalence of sulfonamides, over 1,000 
cocrystal structures are available in the PDB harboring sul
fonamidecontaining ligands.2 However, the contribution of 
the sulfonamide motif to affinity is usually poorly defined 
and little is known regarding the interaction energies re
sulting from the sulfonamide oxygenprotein contacts. SMILES; Match Type Substructure (including Stereoiso
