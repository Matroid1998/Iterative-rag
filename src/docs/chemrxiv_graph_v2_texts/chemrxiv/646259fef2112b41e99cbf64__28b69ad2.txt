Description:
Forms lamellar phases driven by the crystallization of long alkyl segments.

For example, Winey and coworkers have 
suggested that decoupled ion transport occurs in SICs derived from carboxylate or sulfonateterminated 
alkanes that form lamellar and hexagonal phases (Figure 1A, 1 and 2), respectively, driven by the 
crystallization of their long alkyl segments.15,16 Sidechainfunctionalized polymers with percolated ionic 
aggregates (3),17 mesogenic sidechains that promoted nanoscale ordering (4),18 or precisely placed 
dissociative ions (5)19 have also been proposed to leverage decoupled ion conduction.17,19,20 Nevertheless, 
the ion conductivities in the dry state for these materials are either much lower than traditional SPEs or 
not reported; new design strategies are needed to facilitate cation mobility in crystalline, polyanionbased 
materials.
