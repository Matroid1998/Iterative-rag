Yields peptide conjugates.

of 3CzIPN occurred in 6788 yield with exclusive 
formation of the desired products 6aa6ea. Cys within a cationic cell penetrating peptide TAT40 
can also be selectively modified, affording 6fa. Additionally, 3CzIPN was successfully 
introduced onto a mitochondria localization sequence (MLS) 41 and a nucleus localization 
sequence (NLS)42 to give 6ga and 6ha. In the case of cyclic peptide 5l, a potent v3 integrin 
binder, Cys at the Cterminus was selectively modified leading to 6ia in 65 yield. Furthermore, Substance P yielded peptide conjugate 6ka. Two helical peptides binding to 
the protein catenin43 and MDM244 gave conjugates 6na and 6ma, respectively. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20244jms8 ORCID httpsorcid.org000000024570914X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
