Description:
A transition metal that coordinates with histidine to influence mechanical properties.

Marine worms also 
incorporate metalcoordination crosslinks in their hard, condensed mandibular structure.911 

One example of biological metal coordination is the coordination interaction between histidine 
and common transition metals such as Ni2, Zn2, and Cu2, which has been implicated to facilitate 
diverse mechanical behavior ranging from hardness in the jaws of the Glycera and Nereis to 
dissipation in the byssal threads of the Mytilus (Fig. 1A).9,10,1216 Accordingly, there has been 
growing interest17 in utilizing the interactions between common biogenic transition metals and 
histidine (or imidazole, the functional group in histidine) as crosslinkers in synthetic materials, 
such as in polymer materials1823 and histidinerich proteinbased materials.2426
