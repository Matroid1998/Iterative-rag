Description:
A catalyst used in bioorthogonal profluorophore activation in living cells.

Text:
In this context, our group described the application of encapsulin as a nanoreactor scaffold for 
52 
bioorthogonal profluorophore activation in living cells catalyzed by a Meggerstype ruthenium catalyst (RuH), 
53 
covalently bound to HaloTag localized in encapsulin.17 Since the emergence of sequential bimetallic 
54 
transformations as useful approaches to build complex molecules in one pot without the need to isolate 
55 
intermediates, we now followed the idea to transform our construct into a novel nanoreactor capable of performing 
56 
a twostep bimetallic reaction sequence in aqueous systems and biorelevant media.
