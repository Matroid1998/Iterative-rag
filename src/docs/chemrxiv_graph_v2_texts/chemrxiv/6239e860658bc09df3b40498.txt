Emerging examples of direct plasmonic sensors are plasmonic hydrogen sensors based on 
53 
palladium (Pd) nanoparticles and their alloys.2,18,19 These devices feature sparkfree and room
54 
temperature operation, efficient remote readout with small footprints, subsecond response time 
55 
with excellent resistance to crosscontaminating and deactivating gases, and longterm
