Description:
A carbide material for which few ALD processes have been reported.

Text:
The premier film deposition technique for conformal films is atomic 
layer deposition (ALD) which is based on selflimiting surface reactions of gas phase 
precursors separated by inert gas, which enables conformal coverage of high surface area 
features.13 However, only a few ALD processes have been reported for carbide materials, 
mainly due to the lack of a suitable carbon precursor; the few examples are TaCx14, 
TiCx15, WCx16 and FeCx17. Since BxC films can easily be deposited by thermal chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) with a continuous gas flow,18,19,20,21 it is of great interest to 
develop conformal CVD processes for BxC films.
