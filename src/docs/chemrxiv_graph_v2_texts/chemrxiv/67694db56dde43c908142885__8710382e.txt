Description:
A cation used in highly water soluble probes with long fluorescence lifetime, high photostability, and cell permeability for live cell imaging.

Text:
Consequently, still there is a lack 
of fluorescent probes for livecell imaging of cellcycle progression,5 and most of them are 
frequently limited for their applicability due to UVexcitation, photo bleaching, poor aqueous 
solubility and sensitivity to subcellular environments. Thus, it is critical to develop new cell
permeable freely water soluble molecular probes for nucleus staining to enable realtime 
visualization of biological events during cellcycle progression in live cells. 5a 
Here, we introduce a diazaoxatriangulenium cation (DAOTA) based highly water soluble 
probe, NucDAOTA endowed with long fluorescence lifetime, high photostability, and cell
permeability for the direct visualization of cycle cell in live cells.

Description:
Based DAOTAM2 showed better nucleus targeting with significant enhancement of fluorescence lifetime after binding with G-quadruplexes.

Text:
NucDAOTA exhibits an 
increase in fluorescence intensity and lifetime upon specifically binding with DNA but not with 
RNA (ribonucleic acid) or water soluble protein BSA (bovine serum albumin), that is also a key 
feature of this probe. Vilar et al. 6 has previously investigated some triangulenium dyes as optical 
probes for nucleic acids of different topologies mainly G4 secondary structures, dsDNA (double 
stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) and ssDNA (single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) by using 
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. They found that the diazaoxatriangulenium based 
DAOTAM2 showed better nucleus targeting with a significant enhancement of the fluorescence 
lifetime after binding with Gquadruplexes, in comparison to other forms of nucleic acids. Furthermore, Lacour et al.
