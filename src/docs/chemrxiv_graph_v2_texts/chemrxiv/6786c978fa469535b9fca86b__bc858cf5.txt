Description:
A key precursor material for the synthesis of cathode materials, requiring a calcination temperature of around 900 C.

Text:
Currently, the 
methods used in the purification process require large amounts of hazardous chemicals as well as long
duration and energyintensive steps to produce the final material. Mainstream cathode materials such 
as LiCoO2, LiNixMnyCozO2 or LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 employ lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium 
hydroxide (LiOH) as key precursor materials for their synthesis, with LiOH being preferred due to the 
lower calcination temperature of around 650 C required to obtain the oxide cathode materials from 
LiOH as opposed to around 900 C for lithium carbonate.3,4 In the case of LiOH production from hard
rock minerals, acidroasting of the spodumene mineral with sulphuric acid produces a lithium 
sulphate (Li2SO4) leachate. The subsequently purified leachate would then be converted into the 
desired LiOH by reacting with caustic soda.

Description:
A high-purity product used as a precursor in LiOH battery production.

It also generates a 
significant chemical byproductwaste which undermines the sustainability of the overall battery 
manufacturing process.5 
Electrodialysis has recently been proposed as an alternative green technology to convert leachate 
produced from ores, Lirich brines, or even existing highpurity Li2CO3 products into LiOH battery 
precursors.6 Electrodialysis uses ion exchange membranes that enable the selective transport of ions 
based on their charge and size, and is a wellestablished method used in water desalination for the 
separation of metallic cations and their accompanying anions.7 In the specific case of Li salts, selective 
separation in a costeffective and environmentally sustainable manner has been reported.6,810 
Furthermore, electrodialysis can produce green hydrogen as a result of the watersplitting reaction 
that occurs during LiOH production.
