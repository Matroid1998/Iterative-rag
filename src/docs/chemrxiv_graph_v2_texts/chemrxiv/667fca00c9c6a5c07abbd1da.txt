Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MRTADF) compounds hold great potential 
as emitters in organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) as devices with these materials can achieve 
simultaneously high efficiencies and saturated colors.1, 2, 3, 4 Distinct from traditional donoracceptor (D
A) TADF emitters, MRTADF emitters typically are p and ndoped nanographenes.5, 6, 7 Their rigid 
molecular structures suppress vibronic modes and result in small geometric reorganization in the excited 
states, resulting in narrow full width at half maxima (FWHMs, typically 50 nm) and small Stokes 
shifts of less than 30 nm.8, 9 The origin of the TADF in MRTADF emitters results from their distinct 
frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distributions, leading to an alternating pattern of increasing and 
decreasing electron density in the excited states compared to the ground state that is responsible for the 
suitably small singlettriplet energy gap, DEST.4, 10, 11, 12 This distribution pattern leads to these materials 
emitting from a shortrange chargetransfer (SRCT) excited state.1, 13 Moreover, as the electron density 
globally resides across the same atoms, the oscillator strength for the SRCT transitions is high, resulting 
in fast radiative decay rate constants (kr), manifested in high photoluminescence quantum yields (FPL).14, 
15 However, in most MRTADF systems, the RISC rate constants (kRISC) typically struggle to reach even 
104 s1,16, 17 which are much slower than those of most advanced DA TADF emitters.18, 19, 20, 21 Such 
slow kRISC values are disadvantageous for efficient triplet harvesting, and the accumulation of longlived
