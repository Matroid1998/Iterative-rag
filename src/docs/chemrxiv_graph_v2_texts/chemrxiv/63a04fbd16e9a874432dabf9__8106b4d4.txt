Description:
An electronegative group used in the synthesis of noble gas compounds.

Text:
Although noble gases were long considered inert, we now know that they may form
compounds which are interesting because of their octetrule breaking origin. Compared to
compounds formed by other elements, these compounds are not many, but the quest to nd
new ones continues since the seminal Neil Bartletts discovery of the rst xenon compound
1, 2. Since then, many successful syntheses, as well as theoretical and computational
developments have followed 36. Among them, syntheses conducted in lowtemperature
matrices using a method developed in Helsinki 710. The molecules synthesised in lowtemperature matrices in Helsinki have the general for
mula HNgY where Ng denotes a noblegas atom and Y is an electronegative group, e.g. F,
Cl, OH.
