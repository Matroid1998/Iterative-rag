Description:
Used in well-defined alkylidene complexes as catalysts due to stability towards air and moisture.

Text:
Olefin metathesis has become a device of prominent importance for CC double bond formation
thus earning an outstanding position in the organic synthesis toolbox.1 Especially welldefined
rutheniumbased alkylidene complexes are widely used as catalysts due to their stability towards
air and moisture. The discovery of Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)2 has made a great impact in
the field, giving birth to even more stable and efficient second generation catalysts (e.g. Ru1 and
Ru2, Figure 1).3
Despite the incredible progress made in the discipline, there are still many hurdles to overcome,
one of which is the ineffectiveness of these popular, generalpurpose ruthenium catalysts in the
formation of tetrasubstituted or crowded CC double bonds (Figure 1).4
