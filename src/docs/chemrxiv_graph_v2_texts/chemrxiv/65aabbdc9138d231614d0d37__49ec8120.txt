Description:
Monomers used for their fast propagation rates in ring-opening metathesis polymerization.

Text:
Rutheniuminitiated ringopening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an 
invaluable tool in the polymer chemists repertoire due to the commercial availability of fast
initiating ruthenium initiators and various strained olefin monomers, its wide functional group 
tolerance, and the ease in which complex polymers may be synthesized in a rapid and controlled 
manner. Grubbs 3rd generation pyridineligated precatalysts (G3) are most frequently used for

living ROMP due to their fast initiation rates.1 Moreover, exonorbornenes (NB) are often used 
as monomers due to their fast propagation rates, especially in comparison to their endo 
counterparts.2, 3 ExoNBs are, however, often more difficult to synthesize and more expensive 
than their endo isomers.
