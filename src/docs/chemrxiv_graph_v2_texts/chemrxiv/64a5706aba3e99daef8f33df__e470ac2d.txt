Description:
A clean fuel produced using nanosized materials.

In order to avoid or limit
the utilization of fossil fuels, recently, many researchers have proposed more strategies to produce clean fuels
such as hydrogen (H2), Ammonia (NH3), hydrous hydrazine, Metalion batteries from diverse sources using
nanosized materials. In this ways, more recently, Naseeb, W et al 22 have engineered RuCoO heterostructures
nanoparticles anchored over dual heteroatom (N,S) codoped graphene nanosheets named as (RuCoOSNG)
for high catalytic hydrogen production from water electrolysis by direct hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In
1.0 M KOH, RuCoOSNG displayed 90 mV and 10 mA as overpotential and current density under HER
process which was comparable to the stateoftheart (PtC (60 mV)) a long with stability.

Decomposes to release hydrogen with high selectivity.

Also, Singh,S et al
23 showed the generation of hydrogen via the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2 H2O)
over a bimetallic NickelIridium (NixIr1xB) catalysts. As resulted from the experimental studies, Ni0.95Ir0.05B
and Ni0.90Ir0.10B exhibited the highest selectivity for hydrogen release from hydrous hydrazine. Which was close
to 100 of hydrogen selectivity from H2NNH2 H2O decomposition. Moreover, Both (Ni1xPtx) and (Ni1xPdx)
have been considered as a good catalyst materials for the degradation of hydrous hydrazine as fully described in
24,25. Suitable selectivity (close to 100) was achieved with Pt content as low as 7 mol  and superior to
80 hydrogen selectivity with 40 of Palladium loading respectively.
