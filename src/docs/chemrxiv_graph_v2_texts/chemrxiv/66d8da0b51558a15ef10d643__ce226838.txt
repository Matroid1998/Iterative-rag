Description:
Involved in bioelectrochemical CO reduction and ALE processes to enhance growth rates.

Text:
The principles and applications of ALE have demonstrated its simplicity and efficacy in tailoring microbial pheno
types for improved industrial performance.12,13 Examples of successful ALE applications illustrate the transferability, 
flexibility and transformative potential of ALE in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.1419 For example, ALE 
of Sporomusa ovata integrated with lightharvesting silicon nanowires led to a 2.4fold increase in COreducing 
current density, enhancing bioelectrochemical CO reduction.16 Similarly, C. autoethanogenum strains developed 
through ALE showed superior growth and product profiles in continuous bioreactor cultures.19 ALE using CO and 
H, with other C. autoethanogenum lineages exposed to 2 CO, has also significantly enhanced growth rates and
