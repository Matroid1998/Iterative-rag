Description:
A bond formation frequently used in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Amide bond formation is one of the most frequently used reactions in medicinal chemistry.1 
The demand for greener approaches for amide bond formation has been growing over the last 
decade.2 Although amide bond formation via acid chloride or acid anhydride is particularly 
useful in the largescale synthesis,3 this approach usually requires organic bases (e.g. Et3N 
101 gmol) for trapping the generated acid. An alternative method, the SchottenBaumann 
reaction4, uses environmentally friendly solvents (e.g. water) and inorganic bases (e.g. NaOH 
40 gmol) which are less wasteful and inexpensive. Therefore, the SchottenBaumann reaction 
has a high potential to achieve greener amide bond formation. However, water that is necessary for dissolving inorganic bases often causes undesired 
hydrolysis of electrophile in the SchottenBaumann reaction.
