Involved in polar interactions such as hydrogen bonding.

Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of increasing 
concern due to potential adverse effects on human health and 
ecosystems. Despite their high concern, the equilibrium 
partition properties of PFAS remain to be elucidated. Even basic 
property data such as octanolwater partition coefficients (Kow) 
are scarce for PFAS.13 To my knowledge, only one scientific 
paper4 has reported measured Kow values for neutral PFAS with 
perfluoroalkyl chain lengths of 4 or more. Similarly, reliable 
airwater partition coefficients (Kaw) were available for only a few 
neutral PFAS with (CF2)4 until our group recently reported 
experimental values for 21 PFAS.5 
The equilibrium partition of organic compounds is 
determined by the intermolecular interactions of the organic 
compounds with the surrounding phases, including polar (e.g., 
hydrogen (H)bonding) and nonpolar (i.e., van der Waals) 
interactions.
