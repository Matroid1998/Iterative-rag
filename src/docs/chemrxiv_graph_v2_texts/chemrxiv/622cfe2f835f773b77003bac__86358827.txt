Description:
An organic polymer aerogel with low light transmittance or opacity.

Aerogels have fascinated researchers because of their characteristic properties derived from their 
lowdensity structures. They have been fabricated from various materials, among which silica 
aerogel is the most representative one because of its high light transmittance and thermal 
insulation properties.1 However, among porous materials with low bulk densities, not many 
skeletal compositions lead to high visible light transmittance. Organic polymer aerogels such as 
resorcinolformaldehyde (RF),2 polyimide3 and polyurethane4 have low light transmittance 
or are opaque, and carbon aerogels5, 6 are black. On the other hand, bionanofiber gels, e.g.
