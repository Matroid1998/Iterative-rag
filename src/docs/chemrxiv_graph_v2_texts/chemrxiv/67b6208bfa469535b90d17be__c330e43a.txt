Description:
Used in the industrial process of heterogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation.

Text:
Widely employed by industry as a precursor for dyes, agrochemicals, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and 
methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, an intermediate in polyurethane manufacture, aniline (benzenamine) is 
globally manufactured at 7 million ta rate. Demand is strong and production growing at 5.3 compound 
annual growth rate.1 The industrial process employs the heterogeneously catalyzed nitrobenzene (NB) hy
drogenation carried out either in vapor phase or in in liquid phase.

Description:
Suggested as a surface intermediate in a newly proposed reaction mechanism.

Text:
In the vapor phase process NB is fed 
with hydrogen into a tubular reactor containing a supported Cu catalyst at 270 290 C and 15 bar in the 
presence of a 91 (H2NB) excess of hydrogen.2 In the liquid phase process, the capability for utilization of 
reaction heat (more than 500 kJ mol1) is much higher due to higher heat transfer coefficient, and supported 
noble metals (palladium and platinum) are employed.3 
Given the industrial and economic relevance of the process, plentiful academic and industrial research is 
still conducted today to improve the existing processes.4 In 2005, Jackson in collaboration with catalysis 
industrys researchers demonstrated that the Habers threestep reaction mechanism (aniline converted to 
nitrosobenzene, the latter to phenylhydroxylamine, and phenylhydroxylamine to aniline) is wrong.5 The 
newly suggested reaction mechanism indicates formation of PhN(OH) (nitrobenzene) as surface interme
diate.
