Subject to reduction in electrocatalytic processes.

Text:
Recently, some doubleatom catalysts were reported to 
exhibit higher activity than singleatom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction 
(ORR),23 CO2 reduction,24 and cocatalyst for photoanode.25 However, double atom OER 
electrocatalysts composed of only earthabundant elements are hitherto unknown. Herein, we 
report such a CoFe doubleatom catalyst, which exhibits turnover frequencies (TOFs) 
comparable to stateoftheart OER catalysts. This doubleatom catalyst is generated from a 
singleatom Co precatalyst (CoNC) via an insitu electrochemical method. The work presents, 
to our knowledge, the first example of doubleatom electrocatalyst that is highly efficient for OER.
