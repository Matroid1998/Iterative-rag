Description:
Abbreviation for carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant used in epilepsy treatment.

Text:
Given the sheer number of distinct 
PPCPs and the vast variations in their potential environmental impact,2,3,7,8 it is clear that a 
prioritization based on the occurrence and hazard potential of individual compounds (also 
considering their metabolites,9 decomposition products, and PPCP mixtures10) has to be 
developed in order to tackle these problems.8,11 
One particularly relevant PPCP contaminant is carbamazepine (5Hdibenzob,fazepine5
carboxamide, C15H12N2O, abbreviated CBZ in the following), an anticonvulsant that is widely 
used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.12 The CBZ molecule, shown in Figure 
1, consists of a tricyclic dibenzazepine system that carries a carboxamide (carbamoyl) group 
at the nitrogen atom of the azepine ring.

Description:
Highly persistent in the environment and hardly degraded or adsorbed during conventional wastewater treatment processes.

Text:
It has been established that CBZ is highly persistent 
in the environment, and that it is hardly degraded or adsorbed during conventional wastewater 
treatment processes.2,3,5,13 As a consequence, CBZ can be present in treated wastewater, 
resulting in an accumulation in plants irrigated with such water.14 A risk assessment showed 
that concentrations of CBZ and its main metabolites that are typically observed in surface 
waters pose no direct risk to human health.15 On the other hand, its presence may have 
adverse effects on aquatic organisms.1619 For example, it was demonstrated that 
environmental levels of CBZ (low g L1 range) can disturb the growth and development of 
embryos and larvae of zebrafish, and alter their response to stimuli.18 Due to its persistence 
and hazard potential, CBZ is frequently listed among the highpriority PPCP contaminants 
that should receive particular attention in future studies addressing the monitoring and 
management of environmental risks.2,3,11,20 
Various wastewater treatment options have been considered to increase the removal efficiency 
for PPCP contaminants, including advanced oxidation processes (e.g., photolysis, ozonation), 
adsorption processes using different types of adsorbents, and membrane separations.5,21 Not 
all of these techniques are well suited for the removal of CBZ, which is a particularly recalcitrant 
contaminant.
