Description:
Used as a precursor to produce gypsum for construction and decorative purposes.

Text:
Calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO40.5H2O), also known as bassanite,
has been used as a precursor to produce gypsum (dihydrate, CaSO42H2O) for
various
construction
and
decorative
purposes
since
prehistoric
times1. Nowadays, it is widely used for plasterboard and stucco manufacturing,
construction, fireproofing, biomedical applications, and even some forms of 3D
printing. It is estimated that 100200 million tonnes are used each year25,
making it one of the most widely consumed mineral resources. However, as
there are
no significant natural deposits of bassanite existing on the Earths
surface, it has to be synthesized. The main route to obtain hemihydrate is a
thermal treatment of gypsum at temperatures typically between 150 C and 200
C to remove some of the structural water6.
