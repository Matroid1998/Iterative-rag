Description:
A chemical element that can modulate compounds' potency, physicochemical parameters, and metabolic stability.

It is widely recognized that fluorination has become a mainstream design approach in discovery of medicines, agrochemicals, 
and other biologically active compounds 110. Fluorinated motifs can modulate the compounds potency, physicochemical 
parameters, and metabolic stability. Among other properties affected by Fluorine, lipophilicity (typically measured through 1octanol  
water partition coefficient logarithm, LogP) is one of the most complex phenomena, and despite numerous studies in this area 
11,12,21,1320, we are still far from its comprehensive understanding. It is generally accepted that monofluorination of aromatic 
compounds results in a slight increase of their lipophilicity (HanschLeo lipophilicity parameter   0.14 22) (Figure 1, A), albeit 
there are exceptions to this rule 9. In the case of aliphatic counterparts, both decrease and increase of the LogP values upon the 
fluorination are common 14,23,24.
