Description:
Materials investigated for their real structure using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy.

The structure of materials produced under pressure is of great 
interest because it usually contains defects, which, in turn, affect the properties of the resulting 
material. The deformation that occurs during the pressure treatment introduces various defects into 
the material dislocations, stacking faults, twins, etc. Localized deformation in the form of shear 
bands and areas of strong local flow leads to structural heterogeneity. Due to the presence of 
defects, the shear strength of real crystals is significantly reduced compared to an ideal crystal. The 
defects affect the electrical, diffusion, optical, emission, photoelectric, magnetic and other 
properties of the material 6. The aim of the present work was to investigate the real structure of 
new boronrich chalcogenides, B6Se and B6S, using highresolution transmission electron 
microscopy. Experimental
