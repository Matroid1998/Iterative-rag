Description:
Used to synthesize bioconjugates such as conjugate vaccines and antibody drug conjugates.

Text:
The maleimidethiol chemistry 1 is widely used to synthesize bioconjugates, including 
conjugate vaccines and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) 2. The resultant 
thiosuccinimide linker in these bioconjugates, (Figure 1, structure III) is unstable in vivo 
due to the retroMichael reaction 3. Molecules with free thiols that are available in 
appreciable concentrations in vivo, react with the thiosuccinimide linker, releasing the 
antigen or the drug that is linked to the carrier protein. This process known as thiol 
exchange 4 could have a negative impact for the biological activity and cytotoxicity for 
the synthesized bioconjugate 5.
