Description:
A p-type oxide with low mobility and conductivity due to the polaronic nature of holes bound to Cu states at the valence band maximum.

High mobility ptype transparent conducting materials (TCMs) have eluded researchers for decades. The unlikely bedfellows of optical transparency, valence band dispersion and correct point defect
chemistry prove dicult to unite, with this strict requirement precluding the vast majority of mate
rials from ever displaying ptype transparent conducting properties. Early efforts focused on the
development of ptype oxides, such as CuAlO2, 1 attempting to mimic the wide optical band gap
of the ntype transparent conducting oxides. However, CuAlO2 and other delafossite materials are
plagued by low mobility and conductivity due to the polaronic nature of the holes generated in
these systems, which are bound to Cu states at the valence band maximum.
