Description:
A precursor chemical used in the synthesis of magnetic beads.

Text:
Their inhouse preparation, although low cost as shown in bioonthe
magnetic beads (BOMB) initiative or through minimal instrument intensive synthesis3,4, still require 
precursor chemicals (such as methacrylic acid, triethyl orthosilicate, chitosan, Fe (II) and Fe (III) salts, 
and alkaline solution), instruments (magnetic stirrerhot plate), and at least 7  24 h of preparation time. Although felicitous for fast and mostly instrumentfree nucleic acid extraction, such magnetic particle 
preparation is difficult to execute in limitedresource settings. The requirement of instrumentfree methods suitable for limitedresource settings has led to the 
development and innovation of alternative techniques of nucleic acid extraction.
