Description:
Metal anodes with a theoretical volumetric capacity around 3800 mAh cm3.

Text:
Rechargeable magnesium batteries have an appealing volumetric 
energy density, thanks to the theoretical volumetric capacity of Mg metal anodes  
around 3800 mAh cm3, which is higher by far compared to that of Li metal anodes  
around 2040 mAh cm3. Importantly, the main advantage of rechargeable Mg batteries 
is the possible use of thin Mg or Mg alloys (90 Mg) foils as anodes. Hence, Mg 
batteries has advantageous also in terms of costeffectiveness, thanks to the high 
abundance of Mg in earth crust. One of the major challenges on the way to develop 
practical 
Mg 
batteries 
is 
to 
exhibit 
electrolyte 
solutions 
in 
which 
Mg 
depositiondissolution processes are fully reversible (nearly 100) and yet possessing 
a wide enough electrochemical window, with an anodic stability  3V vs.
