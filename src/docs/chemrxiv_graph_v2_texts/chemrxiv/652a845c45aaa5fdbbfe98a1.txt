Description:
Forms intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds.

In that regard,
the sensitivity of the dye introduced by the intramolecular
chargetransfer (ICT) can be monitored by changes in ab
sorption, emission, Stokes shift, and fluorescence quantum
yield (FQY). The intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen
and halogen bonds 10,11 or stacking can lead to aggrega
tion, which affects the same set of photophysical properties,
providing the aggregationinduced emission (AIE) or aggre
gationcaused quenching (ACQ) mechanisms for FQY con
trol. The number of structural features of a molecule (rigid
ityflexibility, proton transfer, hydrophobichydrophilic na
ture of dye) deliver the technical tools to influence subtle
intermolecular interactions and thus achieve desired aggre
gationinduced emission change.
