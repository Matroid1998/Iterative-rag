Description:
Large conjugated compounds whose aromaticity cannot be reliably assessed using B3LYP due to delocalization errors.

In addition, we employ the GMTKN55 database to test the performance of BLYP35. These
new results conrm cP6b6  T66 is either weakly aromatic or nonaromatic and provide computational
evidence that only two of the molecules studied in Ref. 4 can be considered aromatic. Level of theory
The size of these molecules severely constraints the computational methods that can be used to study
molecular nanorings and, for this reason, we are limited to DFAs and singlepoint wavefunction calcu
lations. At this stage, we believe it is rmly established that B3LYP suers from large delocalization
errors and it cannot be used to assess the aromaticity of large conjugated porphyrins.3,4 The open ques
tion is which DFA is more reliable to study these compounds.
