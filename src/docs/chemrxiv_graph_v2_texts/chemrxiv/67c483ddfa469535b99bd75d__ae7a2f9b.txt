Malaria is a significant public health concern in several countries. However, more cases of 
malaria occur in subSaharan Africa1. Several approaches have been reported to battle this public health 
concern. These methods include vaccinations, vector control, and widespread medicine administration 
2. However, high parasite resistance to therapeutics treatments and insecticides a principal challenge 
when treating malaria 3. Therapeutic approaches such as propoxur sulfalene, primaquine, pyrimethamine, chloroquine, 
larviciding, and artemisinin target Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium falciparum, 
Anopheles gambiae s.l., and Plasmodium malariae1Artemisinin combined therapies (ACT) are first
line treatment for a middle case of malaria caused by P. falciparum. Due to their rapid action, 
unexplainable potency leads to a high patient recovery rate 4.
