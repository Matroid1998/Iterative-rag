Description:
Has a stable monolayer phase at low temperatures with a tilted-antiparallel orientation.

Experimentally it is known that, at a coverage of 1 ML (  1, one CO per surface Na),
a (11) parallelupright (PU) phase with C atoms pointing downward (to Na) is the
most stable phase above 35 K. Below this temperature a p(11) PU p(21) TA phase
transition occurs, with TA denoting a tiltedantiparallel orientation.1 Density functional
theory (DFT) confirmed that indeed, the most stable monolayer phase of CONaCl(100) at
low temperatures is TA.24 PU is favoured at higher T for   1, but also found at low,
submonolayer coverages, even at low T according to theory.
