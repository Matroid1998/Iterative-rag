Description:
Exhibits metallike characteristics in organoboron compounds.

Text:
Among them, organoboron compounds, where the electron
deficient boron exhibits metallike characteristics, are highly promising as metalfree catalysts.20,21 For 
example, trialkyl boranes, which form stable Lewis adducts when combined with Lewis bases, can 
facilitate a range of ROP reactions, such as the polymerization of epoxides and their copolymerization 
with carbon dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, isocyanates, and anhydrides.2227 
Although organoboron catalysts are generally known to have lower catalytic performance 
compared to many advanced metalbased catalysts and are known for their complex synthesis, recent 
developments suggest this perception is changing.

Description:
Part of a bifunctional organoboron catalyst that combines with a quaternary ammonium salt.

Text:
In a seminal study by Wu and colleagues, they 
introduced a bifunctional organoboron catalyst that combines a boron center with a quaternary 
ammonium salt, showcasing remarkable reactivity in ROP.28 These catalysts have proven to be easily 
accessible and highly versatile, useful for a variety of chemical transformations, including the 
copolymerization of epoxides with anhydrides and the conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates.2931 The 
approach of covalently linking Lewis acids and Lewis bases not only preserves their individual chemical 
properties but also allows tuning the linker to enhance the synergistic catalytic activity of both 
components. This design strategy has been extended to various molecular structures incorporating other 
onium salts and boranes.
