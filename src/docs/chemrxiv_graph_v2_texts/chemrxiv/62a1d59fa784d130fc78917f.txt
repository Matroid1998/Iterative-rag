Description:
Predominantly operated through numerous reversible insertion and extraction of lithium ions in lithium-ion batteries.

These days, spheres related to portable electronic 
equipment, electric vehicles, space technology, defense industry. Otherwise, items revolution 
which is similar with Environmentally Friendly Electric Vehicle.1 Demonstrate that high
performance rechargeable battery is becoming one of the trends. Among these conditions, the three significant components of a benchmark approximately 
batteries are durability, safety, and property.2 It resembles a lithiumion battery (LIB) initially 
invented by M. Stanley Whittingham in the 1970s. As time goes by, the most central event is the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2019, which is contemporary researches indicating that lithiumion 
batteries predominantly operated through numerous reversible insertion and extraction of lithium 
ions between the positive and negative active materials focused as metal oxides containing lithium
ions, and graphite.3
