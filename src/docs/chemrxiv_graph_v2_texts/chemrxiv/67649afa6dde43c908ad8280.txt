Description:
Contains negatively charged nitrogen vacancy defects.

Text:
Molecules and crystals are seldom electrically neutral. In crystals, excess or depletion of charge
compensates for the presence of defects, which are present in significant percentages even in the
purest samples of materials such as diamond (the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy). Charges
on molecular systems drive a number of mechanisms. The opposing charges on the components
of an ionic liquid result in their solubility and drive their electrostatic interactions.
