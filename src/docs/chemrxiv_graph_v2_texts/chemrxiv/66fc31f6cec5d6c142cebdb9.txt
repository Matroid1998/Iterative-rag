Description:
Involved in conversion processes within heterogeneous catalysis.

Text:
The signicance of heterogeneous catalysis extends across elds such as energy production,1
carbon dioxide conversion,2,3 and the synthesis of numerous chemicals,4,5 underlining its
indispensable role in advancing sustainable and economically viable chemical processes.6,7
Accurate chemical models are important, especially in the context of catalyst screening and
discovery, where having an accurate model prior to synthesizing a new catalyst could save
time, money, and resources.
