Description:
A fluorescent dye used to identify cancer cells by staining nucleic acid.

Text:
Fluorescence is the light emission by an atom or molecule due to electronic transition, which is 
stimulated by the absorption of electromagnetic energy from external radiation. This phenomenon 
was first formally reported in 1565, but the term fluorescence was first proposed by Sir George 
Gabriel Strokes who was a British physicist and mathematician, and was derived from fluorspar in a 
footnote of his famous paper entitled On the Change of Refrangibility of Light published in 18521. After that, fluorescence has been applied as an investigative tool in many different areas, from 
materials technology to life science. In 1953, fluorescent dyes were first applied in Medicine, using 
berberine sulfate, acid fuchsin and acridine to identify cancer cells in vaginal smears by staining the 
nucleic acid.
