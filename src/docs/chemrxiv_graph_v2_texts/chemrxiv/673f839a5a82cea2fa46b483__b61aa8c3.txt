Description:
One of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with a global warming potential 27 to 30 times higher than CO2 over a 100-year timespan.

Text:
The production of natural gas (NG) in the US increased by 4, 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), in 2023 
compared to the production in 2022 1. Natural gas consists of between 70 and 90  methane (CH4) 2, 
one of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although CH4 stays in the atmosphere for a 
shorter period than CO2 3, it has a global warming potential that is 27  30 times higher than CO2 in a 
100year timespan 4, 5, 6. Methane is emitted from natural sources, such as wetlands, and 
anthropogenic sources, such as energy production and agricultural activities 7. Globally, emissions from the energy sector accounted for approximately 130 million tonnes of CH4 in 
2023 8.

Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted from the oil and gas industry, both intentionally and unintentionally.

Text:
In the US, operations in the oil and gas (O  G) industry are the second largest industrial source 
of emissions 3. Federal and state regulations 9, 10 require operators to implement leak detection 
and repair (LDAR) programs to reduce intentional (vented) and unintentional (fugitive) methane 
emissions 11 from the OG industry in the US and Canada. Although current regulatoryapproved methods for LDAR programs, such as EPA method 21 and OGI 
camera surveys 12, can provide precise component or equipment unitlevel measurements, they can 
be expensive and laborintensive when scaled over thousands of OG facilities. Also, studies have shown 
that emissions exhibit spatial and temporal variability 13, 14, 15, 16 making it challenging to 
estimate the size of emissions in a facility accurately from surveys.
