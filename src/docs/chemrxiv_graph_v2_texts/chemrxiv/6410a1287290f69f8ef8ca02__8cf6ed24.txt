Plays a crucial role in electrochemical energy storage for lithium-ion cathodes.

Text:
The exploration and optimisation of novel chemistries
for lithiumion cathode materials remains a vast area of
research for the materials science community 15 ow
ing to the crucial role of electrochemical energy stor
age in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Dis
ordered rock salt lithiumion cathodes are an emerg
ing materials class in this area 69. These materi
als share the closepacked oxygen framework present
in most commercial lithiumion cathode materials such
as the layered rock salt cobalt and nickelrich struc
tures 10, 11 conferring an excellent masstocharge ra
tio and volumetric efficiency. While performant, layered
cobalt and nickel rich structures have poor longterm
technoeconomic prospects 12.

Description:
Reversibly intercalates into the host framework, dependent on atomistic diffusion processes.

Text:
This is in contrast to
for examplemanganese and iron which are cheaper and
more abundant, but their layered structural analogues
are not stable over many intercalation cycles 1315. Embracing cation disorder enables the use of novel
cathode chemistries that do not need to maintain a lay
ered ordering on cycling 7, 1623. The performance
of any intercalation cathode is limited by the ability of
lithium to reversibly intercalate into the host frame
work which is dependent on atomistic diffusion pro
cesses. Figure 1 illustrates a cubic closepacked oxy
gen lattice. In both the layered and disordered sys
tems lithium diffusion occurs from an octahedral hole
in the O2framework via an octahedral face, into an in
terstitial tetrahedron.

Description:
The energy barrier for lithium hopping is influenced by its stability in the tetrahedral hole.

Text:
The diffusing ion then occupies
a new octahedral site via another shared octahedral
tetrahedral face (an octtetoct hop)6. The energy
barrier for lithium hopping is then strongly influenced
by the stability of lithium in the tetrahedral hole 24. The stability of lithium in this tetrahedral transition
state depends on factors such as the identity of the face
sharing cations too many facesharing transition met
als destabilises the lithium in the tetrahedral transition
state increasing the energy barrier for lithium diffusion
6, 25. In disordered rock salt cathodes a percolating
network of lithium sites connected by tetrahedral holes
with no facesharing transition metals (referred to as
0TM sites) is generally found to be necessary for ef
fective longrange diffusion 6, 8, 25.

Description:
In disordered rock salts, lithium requires an excess to ensure long-range percolating network connectivity.

Text:
The pathway for
singleion lithium hopping and a range of potential tran
sition state local environments in disordered rock salts
are shown as a 2D schematic in Figure 2. In a fully random disordered rocksalt with the general
formula Li1xM 1xO2where M is used as a generic
symbol for any transition metala lithium excess of
x 0.09 is required to ensure a long range percolat
ing 0TM network 6, 26. It is found the connectiv
ity of the lithium diffusion network is poorer than ex
pected in a totally random system in almost all cases,
and substantial lithium excesses are required to give
good longrange connectivity of the 0TM network 25.

Description:
Substitutes for the redox-active transition metal, affecting capacity and anion redox activity in disordered rock salt cathodes.

Text:
Minimising the lithium excess is desirable, as the addi
tional lithium substitutes for the redoxactive transition
metal, reducing the capacity or increasing the anion
redox activity which can cause voltage hysteresis and
structural degradation in disordered rock salt cathodes
27. The cause of the reduced lithium percolation in dis
ordered rock salt materials relative to the random limit
is understood to be a consequence of the shortrange or
dering preferences of the cations, which are comprised
of contributions from bonding preferences and electro
statics 8, 25, 28, 29. Thus, finding ways to suppress
unfavourable shortrange ordering is crucial for improv
ing the capacity and overall performance of disordered
