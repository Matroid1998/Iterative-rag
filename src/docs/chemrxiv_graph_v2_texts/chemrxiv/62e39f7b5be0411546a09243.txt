Description:
Central carbon's p-orbitals mediate the mixing of systems with continuous overlap.

Text:
The two mirror plane elements and the two off
axis C2 rotation axes are shown in Figure 1a. The conventional
rectilinear MOs of allene are symmetryadapted to the mirror
operations. If we instead symmetryadapt the MOs to the two
rotation operations we get the two helical orbitals shown in Fig
ure 1a. The choice between these two pictures is arbitrary.2022
The mixing of the systems is mediated by the porbitals on the
central carbon, which forms a basis with continuous overlap be
