Description:
Involved in bonding interactions with implications on mechanical response in perovskites.

Text:
Conceptually, the 
use of molecular A and Xsite species enhances the structural and chemical diversity in these 
perovskites, leading to new opportunities for tuning macroscopic material behaviour.6 Examples 
are tiltandshift engineering to impart ferroelectric properties,7, 8 tunability of hydrogen bonding 
interactions9 between the Asite cation and the 3D BX3 network with ramifications on the 
mechanical response,10, 11 adjustable phase transition thermodynamics,12, 13 and varying 
structural complexities14 amongst others.
