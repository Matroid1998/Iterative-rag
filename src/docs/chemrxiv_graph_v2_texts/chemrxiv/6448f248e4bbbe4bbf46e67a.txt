Description:
In oxygen ion conductors, oxygen defects such as vacancies and interstitials determine ionic conductivity.

Text:
Mixed ionicelectronic conductivity has been identified as one of the important properties of 
materials to be used as electrodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolysers (SOECs), 
collectively termed Solid Oxide Cells (SOCs). As such ionic conductivity plays an important 
role in determining the performance of oxygen ion conductors as electrodes in SOCs. Ionic 
conductivity is the movement of an ion from one site to another through defects in the crystal. In oxygen ion conductors such as the RuddlesdenPopper (RP) phase materials where the 
composition is An1BnO3n1, A Ln and B  transition metals (n  13), it is the oxygen defects 
(vacancies andor interstitials) which determine the ionic conductivity because ionic 
conductivity of a material is directly proportional to the concentration of lattice defects.

In this 
context, the investigation of the oxygen defects in these materials assumes importance. It is here that neutron powder diffraction (NPD) plays a crucial role because the neutron 
scattering length of an oxygen atom is sizeable, 5.8050.004 fm1 and thus easily detectable by
