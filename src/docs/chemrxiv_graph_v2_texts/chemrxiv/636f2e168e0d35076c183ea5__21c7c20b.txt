Description:
Macrocyclic structures that act as a cage to metal atoms, modulating the properties of the complexes.

Text:
In the last decades, the interest in metalbearing macrocyclic porphyrins and phthalocyanines has
expanded beyond its wellknown biological activities1 (viz. oxygen transport, enzymatic activity,
redox catalysis). These biomacromolecules are meanwhile extensively investigated for use in sen
sor systems,2 molecular spintronics,35 and singlemolecule devices.6 The macrocyclic structures,
acting as a cage to the metal atoms, offer a flexible and diverse way to modulate the characteristic
properties of the complexes by accommodating different central metal ions.
