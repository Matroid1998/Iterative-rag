Description:
A two-dimensional planar crystal structure with remarkable thermal conductivity up to 5,000 W/mK.

Text:
For decades it was thought that twodimensional crystals were 
not possible,1,2 until the successful preparation of monolayer 
graphene with mechanical exfoliation3 proved that twodimensional 
planar crystal structures could be isolated.46 These layers are not 
only stable but also exhibit remarkable physical and chemical 
properties not found in their parent materials.7,8 For example, the 
thermal conductivity of suspended monolayer graphene is as high 
as 5,000 WmK as measured by Raman spectroscopy, a value much 
higher than that of bulk diamond or graphite.9 Similarly, at room 
temperature, the carrier mobility in graphene can also reach much 
higher values of up to 15,000 cm2V1s1 and is less dependent on 
temperature than in its bulk counterpart.10 Because of these 
outstanding properties, graphene can be used in highspeed 
electronics,11 optical devices,12 chemical sensors,10,13 energy 
production and storage,12,14,15 and DNA sequencing16,17 among 
many other fields.

Description:
A two-dimensional material with a thickness comparable to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.

Text:
The successful preparation of graphene led to a growing 
number of other twodimensional materials being reported.18 
Similar to graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have 
been studied for some time, with the structure of TMDs first 
reported by Linus and colleagues as early as 1923.19 By the 1960s, 
about 60 TMDs materials had been reported, of which at least 40 
exhibit layered structures,20 for example MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and 
WSe2, among others. These layered crystals not only have a 
thickness comparable to that of graphene, but additionally have an 
intrinsic band gap, which gives them the potential to be used in a 
new generation of small, low energyconsuming transistor 
materials.
