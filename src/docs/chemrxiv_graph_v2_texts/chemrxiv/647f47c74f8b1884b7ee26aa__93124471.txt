Description:
Complexes that produce H2 from protic solutions at modest overpotentials.

Text:
Extensive efforts are currently 
focused on designing efficient and environmentally friendly electrocatalysts that operate at low 
overpotentials. Notably, cobalt diglyoxime complexes have demonstrated the ability to produce 
H2 from protic solutions at relatively modest overpotentials.1
