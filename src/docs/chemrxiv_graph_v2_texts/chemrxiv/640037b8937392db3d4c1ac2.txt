Description:
An atom that can be shared between two acceptors in neutral radical complexes.

Text:
This offers a playground for dynamical and
kinetic studies.3,4
Neutral radical complexes which share a hydrogen atom be
tween two acceptors are less studied, with the exception of the
paradigmatic H3 system which is only (meta)stable in electron
ically excited states.5 The neutral FHF complex has remained
elusive,6 whereas in the ClHCl case, helium nanodroplet experi
ments have shown the absence of a hydrogen bond.7 For BrHBr,
isotope substitution controls the preferred structure in a particu
larly interesting way.8 It again appears desirable to extend the
study of such neutral XHX species to organic radicals X, where
conformational isomerism is expected to influence the energetics
and dynamics of the shared hydrogen atom.9
A natural choice for X is the persistent, sterically hindered
Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Goettingen, Tammannstr.

Description:
Involved in closed hydrogen bond networks in the structure.

Text:
In both cases, there are closed hydrogen
bond networks, involving three TH units for the anhydrous struc
ture and six for the trient or 0.33hydrate. In these structures,
the hydroxylamine adopts a conformation where the hydrogen
points to the open side (o) of the sterically hindered substituted
nitroxyl unit and prefers to bind to the oxygen of a neighbouring
hydroxylamine or water. To close the strained trimeric ring in the
anhydrous crystal, the last TH binds to the N atom (instead of O)
of the first unit. In the 0.33hydrate, the Nbinding is taken over
by water molecules. There is thus a clear numerical preference for
OHO coordination and closed ring structures among TH units
in the solid state.
