Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction, a challenging step in water splitting due to its high thermodynamic potential and kinetic sluggishness.

Text:
The water splitting reaction provides a promising method to store intermittent renewable energy 
resources in the form of hydrogen fuel.1,2 Currently the bottleneck of water splitting is its oxidative 
half reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which has a high thermodynamic potential 
and is kinetically sluggish due to the involvement of four consecutive electrons and protons 
transfer steps.35 Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop heterogeneous OER 
catalysts composed of earthabundant metals.47 However, the heterogeneous nature of these 
catalysts makes it difficult to probe the nature of their active sites.

Description:
Involved in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Text:
Recently, some doubleatom catalysts were reported to 
exhibit higher activity than singleatom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction 
(ORR),23 CO2 reduction,24 and cocatalyst for photoanode.25 However, double atom OER 
electrocatalysts composed of only earthabundant elements are hitherto unknown. Herein, we 
report such a CoFe doubleatom catalyst, which exhibits turnover frequencies (TOFs) 
comparable to stateoftheart OER catalysts. This doubleatom catalyst is generated from a 
singleatom Co precatalyst (CoNC) via an insitu electrochemical method. The work presents, 
to our knowledge, the first example of doubleatom electrocatalyst that is highly efficient for OER.
