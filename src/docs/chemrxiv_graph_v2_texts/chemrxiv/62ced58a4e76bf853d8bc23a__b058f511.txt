EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Homoepitaxial
InP
(001)
was
grown
on
ptype
InP (001) (Zn doped, 2 2.3  1018 cm3 with 2 miscut
toward  111  direction) in a horizontalflow metalor
ganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) reactor (Aixtron,
AIX200) modified to enable a contaminationfree trans
fer to UHV using H2 as carrier gas. Tertbutylphospine
(TBP) and trimethylindium (TMIn) were used as precur
sors. Diethylzinc (DEZn) was used as a pdopant source
for grown InP(001) epilayer. Molar flow of DEZn was ad
justed to ensure a carrier concentration of 2  1018 cm3
in the InP(001) epilayer, which was finally confirmed
by electrochemical capacitance voltage profiling. The
growth was monitored by reflection anisotropy spec
troscopy (RAS) which allows the specific preparation of
the Prich surface (see 9, 10 for details).
