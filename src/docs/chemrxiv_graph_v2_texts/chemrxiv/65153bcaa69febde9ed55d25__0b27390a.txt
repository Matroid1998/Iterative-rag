Description:
Forms sp3-hybridized atoms in diamond, contributing to its hardness and atomic density.

Text:
Diamond is the hardest known material with a Vickers hardness (HV) at the level of 100 GPa and 
density   3.635 gcm3 1. Its structure (space group Fm3m) is formed by cornersharing tetrahedra 
of sp3hybridized carbon atoms with CCC  109.47 and is characterized by the highest atomic 
density (i.e., the number of atoms per unit cell volume) and the highest density per valence electron 
2. A rare hexagonal form of diamond (lonsdaleite) (space group P63mmc) with virtually the same 
density has been claimed to be stronger and stiffer than diamond 3. The network topologies of diamond and lonsdaleite are dia and lon, respectively, and many 
theoretically predicted carbon allotropes have been identified with these topologies (see 4 and 
references therein).
