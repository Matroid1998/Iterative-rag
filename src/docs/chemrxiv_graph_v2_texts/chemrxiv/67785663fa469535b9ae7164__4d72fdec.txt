Description:
Bonds that provide PFAS with thermal and chemical stability.

Text:
Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are anthropogenic substances containing multiple
CarbonFluorine bonds with a hydrophobic polar headgroup and tail. PFAS are a diverse group of
synthetic chemicals that have been produced for over 90 years and can be grouped into 2 categories
shortchain and longchain
PFAS are highly nondegradable substances that serve in a variety of sectors
. 1
like pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, electronics, and even in environmental services for water
treatment because of their strong CF bonds which gives them thermal and chemical stability. 13
However, the same unique properties of PFAS also contribute to bioaccumulation and are toxic
to both humans and the environment
It has persistent global use because of its practical applications but
