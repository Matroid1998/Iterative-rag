Description:
An electron precise Zintl phase with 8 valence electrons per formula unit.

The equiatomic ternary phases represent one of the most populated 
intermetallic structural family, with the orthorhombic TiNiSi (ordered 
Co2Si) and the hexagonal ZrNiAl (ordered Fe2P) structure types as the 
most prolific structures, encompassing over 69 of all reported 
equiatomic phases regardless of the compositions.1 In particular, 
some representatives with the TiNiSi type structure can be described 
as electron precise Zintl phase like CaMgGe, EuMgGe and CaAgSb 
with 8 valence electron per formula unit (8 ve f.u). 24 In contrast, 
the electron poorer analogue CaMgGa (7 ve f.u) adopts rather the 
ZrNiAl type structure.

The pseudoelement concept is a common approach to rationally 
prepared 
isoelectronic 
structures 
with 
different 
chemical 
compositions. In its most general formulation, the pseudoelement 
concept states that isoelectronic atoms form equal numbers of 
bonds. Hence, Zintl phases are expected to retain their structure 
upon isoelectronic replacement of some or all atoms.11 For instance, 
in the ternary phase CaAgSb (8 vef.u), the Ag and Sb atoms could be 
simultaneously replaced by Mg and Ge atoms to form isostructural 
and isoelectronic phase CaMgGe.23 Alternatively, the divalent Mg 
atom in CaMgGe or EuMgGe phases may be replaced by a 
combination of monovalent Ag and trivalent Al, i.e., CaAg1xAlxGe or 
EuAg1xAlxGe systems, to generate isoelectronic pseudoternaries 
CaAg0.5Al0.5Ge or EuAg0.5Al0.5Ge. This is a more general approach to 
a.
