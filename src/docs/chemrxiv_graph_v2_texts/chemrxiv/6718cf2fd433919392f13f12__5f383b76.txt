Description:
A compound that reacts with hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere.

Text:
The theoretical study of the reaction between the hydroxyl (OH) radical and the 
methanethiol (CH3SH) presents some exciting points i) A fulldimensional potential 
energy surface is not available for this gasphase reaction; ii) Its interest in tropospheric 
chemistry, related with adverse effects, such as acid rain, climate changes or visibility 
reduction.13 Thus, the reaction with OH represents one of its important sinks in the 
atmosphere,

iii) It proceeds by two different paths, which are hydrogen abstraction reactions from the 
methyl group, R1, and from the sulphur atom, R2,
