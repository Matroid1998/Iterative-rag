Description:
A dye that binds to the minor grooves of double-stranded DNA and emits fluorescence in the bound state with an intensity 1000 times greater than its unbound state.

However, it involves a sophisticated sequence of thermal steps and 
precise temperature control.2,3 These requirements of PCR have spurred the advancement of 
various isothermal amplification techniques such as loopmediated isothermal amplification 
(LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and rolling circle amplification (RCA).4 
Currently, the quantification of NAATs is usually done using a fluorescent DNA binding dye or 
sequencespecific probe technique.5 7 The dye (e.g. SYBR green) binds to the minor grooves of 
doublestranded DNA only and emits fluorescence in the bound state with an intensity of  1000 
folds compared to its unbound states.8 The intensity of the fluorescence is proportional to the 
amplified product.5 In the probebased technique, an amplicon sequencecomplementary 
nucleic acid probe carrying 
is utilized.
