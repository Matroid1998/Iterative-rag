Description:
A compound used in metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions with 1,2,3triazole.

Text:
1Aryl1H1,2,3triazoles are an important structural motif in bioactive molecules and drugs11 that has led to a 
number of synthetic methods for their construction.12 These methods include the direct reaction of 1,2,3triazole 
with a suitable aryl halide (ArBr, ArI) promoted by metal catalyzed crosscoupling. However, these tend to give 
mixtures of 1 and 2aryl isomers through poor selectivity that limits its utility.13, 14 Methods are preferred where 
the specific creation of the 1aryl triazole of can be controlled by the appropriate choice of reagentssynthons with 
defined and predictable reactivity. Copper(I) catalyzed azidealkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) promotes a 32 
cyclisation where the three contiguous N atoms are provided by an aryl azide synthon (ArN1N2N3).
