Description:
Participates in the thiolene reaction by providing a hydrogen atom that can be abstracted by a peroxy radical.

Text:
The polymerization proceeds 
via a stepgrowth mechanism and the resulting networks show higher homogeneity than 
(meth)acrylate networks polymerized by radical polymerization (Figure 1C).1, 3, 4 The radical 
thiolene reaction is not sensitive to oxygen as the generated peroxy radical readily abstracts a 
hydrogen atom from a thiol which can then proceed in the thiolene reaction. Moreover, the kinetics
