Description:
Involved in photogeneration processes.

Text:
The mechanism 
of dual photoredoxcatalyzed processes implies the interaction between a photocatalyst (PC) and 
a metal complex via the electron or energy transfer (SET or EnT)12. Combining a sensitizer and a 
metal complex catalyst in one molecule often helps to optimize their interaction and to increase 
the activity of the catalytic system 1316. The advantages of the dinuclear photoactive complexes 
was thoroughly studied in such processes as hydrogen photogeneration1719, CO2 
photoreduction14, 20, 21 and photoaccelerated polymerization2225. In recent years IrPd26, 27, Ru
Pd28, 29, RuAu30, RuCu 31, 32 and IrNi 33 dinuclear complexes have been successfully 
employed for the oxydation reactions and carboncarbon and carbonelement bond formation 
reactions under visible light irradiation.
