Description:
Used in composite materials for catalysis with strong affinity for cobalt and copper.

Text:
Catalysis through Nickel designed composite materials has grown exponentially for considerable applications in
the past few decades. As it has a strong affinity for cobalt, copper, and many other transition metals. Thus,
present to it real sophisticated advantages in various technological fields. Research for discovering highly active,
selective and stable catalysts has been carefully regarded for material engineering for many energy fields and
other applications using both simulation and experimental methods 1,5. for exemple, these reactions, oxygen
reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and both Hydrogen oxidation (HOR)reduction (HRR) so well
studied in recent years through diverse form of materials as fully shown in this research articles 6,8.

Description:
Used in catalyst materials to increase reactivity and avoid deactivation.

Text:
It is noticed that the effect of the second metal will improved the performance
Nickel based catalyst materials, it will subsequently increase the reactivity and avoid the deactivation of the
designed Nibased catalyst under the studied catalytic reactions. therefore, the strong affinity of Ni to cobalt,
copper,zinc, and many other transition metals. Thus, award to it very sophisticated advantages in various
technological applications. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the recent advances on nickelbased multifunctional
