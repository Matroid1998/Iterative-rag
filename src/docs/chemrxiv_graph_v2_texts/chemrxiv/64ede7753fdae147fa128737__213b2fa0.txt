Description:
Mainly known for sp2-bonded polytypes characterized by different layer stacking sequences.

2s2, 2pn for the second period elements B, C, N (n  1, 2 and 3, respectively) 
and 3s2, 3p2 for the third period element Si. It should be noted that for boron nitride mainly sp2bonded polytypes are known, which are 
characterized by different layer stacking sequences (e.g. AAAA for hexagonal BN, ABCABC for 
rhombohedral BN, etc.) 5. In our work results on new hexagonal sp3bonded BN polytypes and 
BC2N with cfc topology are presented. The studies of the structures of the new phases based on 
crystallochemical engineering are supported by data on their stability, mechanical and dynamic 
properties, and structure of electronic bands, all calculated in the quantum mechanics framework of 
the Density Functional Theory (DFT) 6,7.
