Description:
Forms strong chemical bonds during the capture process.

Text:
However, the reverse process of CO2 release is energyintensive due to the strong chemical bonds 
(CN bonds) formed during the capture process.4 In addition, aqueous amine solutions are 
corrosive, volatile, toxic, and sensitive toward oxidation and SOxNOx contaminants in flue gas.5 
Pressure swing adsorption (PSA)6 and thermal swing adsorption (TSA)7 are intensively 
investigated as alternatives to liquid amine solutions. They use the changes in either pressure or 
temperature to adsorb and release CO2 from a solid sorbent.
