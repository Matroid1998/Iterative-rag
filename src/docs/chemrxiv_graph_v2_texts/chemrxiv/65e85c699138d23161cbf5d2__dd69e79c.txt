However, the sluggish gas crossover through the 
membrane and the need for highly efficient catalysts on the 
OER side limit the high H2 yield of AWE. It is also notewor
thy that both AWE and PEM require two separate electrodes 
that need to be operated under the same conditions for the 
generation of O2 (anode) and H2 (cathode) simultaneously. To further lower the costs, rational design of earthabun
dant catalysts that show excellent catalytic activities for 
overall water splitting is therefore crucial. Despite the challenges in commercializing largescale water 
electrolysis assembled with nonPGM materials, significant 
progress has been made over the past decade to exploit a 
number of nonPGM catalysts with remarkable water elec
trolysis performance, e.g.
