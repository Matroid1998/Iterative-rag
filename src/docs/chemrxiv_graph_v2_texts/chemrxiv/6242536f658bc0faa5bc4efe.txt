Description:
Functional groups that interact transiently and reversibly with iodine.

Text:
Transient, reversible 
41 
interactions between iodine and the alkene functional groups of squalene constitute one of the 
42 
likeliest candidates in the context of fingermark residues.5 
43 
Chemical fixing of iodine to overcome the drawbacks of transient development and poor contrast 
44 
provided by iodine alone has been achieved several ways, the most common being through its 
45 
encapsulation by starch,4,6 or by reaction with naphthoflavone (a.k.a. 7,8benzoflavone).7 The 
46 
chromophore from the latter fixing reaction has been previously reported as a gemiodo species 
47 
formed after substitution of the ketone group by iodine (vide infra),5b though this unpublished 
48 
report provided no supporting instrumental evidence for that assignment. 49 
Several studies have sought to optimise fingermark development methods based on combined 
50 
iodine and naphthoflavone sprays.
