Polar crystals have found widespread applications across various fields, including electronics,
optics, and pharmaceuticals.13 This broad utility stems from their unique directional properties,
where molecular arrangements create a net dipole moment along a defined axis, leading to valuable
characteristics such as piezoelectricity and nonlinear optical behaviour.4 Quartz exemplifies these

properties, demonstrating how polar symmetry enables precise electromechanical coupling and
optical phenomena essential for technological applications.5,6
Building upon these fundamental principles, polar organic cocrystals represent an emerging class
of materials that combine the advantages of polar symmetry with the versatility of organic chemistry.
