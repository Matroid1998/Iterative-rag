Description:
Present in AAP1 as a substituent in the para position of the phenyl ring.

The 
experimentally 
demonstrated 
superior 
photoswitching 
dynamics 
of 
the 
bridged 
AB 
dihydrodibenzodiazocine with its twisted Eisomer in combination with the theoretically predicted 
twisted groundstate geometry of the orthodimethylated AAP led us to the hypothesis that the latter 
should also exhibit a faster photoswitching dynamics than planar EAAP derivatives7. Therefore, we 
experimentally tested this hypothesis by using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy on four 
AAPs shown in Figure 1. The first AAP pair, comprising AAP1 with a hydrogen atom and AAP2 with an electrondonating 
methoxy group in the para position of the phenyl ring, has a planar Eisomer. The second AAP pair 
comprising AAP3 with a single and AAP4 with two methyl groups in ortho position of the phenyl ring 
has a twisted Eisomer.
