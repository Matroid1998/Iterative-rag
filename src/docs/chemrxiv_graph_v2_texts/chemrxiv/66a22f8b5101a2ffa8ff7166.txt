Glasses containing trivalent rare earths (REs) exhibit unique luminescence and mechanical
26
properties;18 however, compared to common silicate glass systems containing lightelement
27
alkalis and alkaline earths, there is a lack of understanding of their structures. In the 15
28
lanthanide elements (La through Lu), the seven 4f orbitals are lled sequentially by 14
29
electrons, and all have 5s25p6 electron congurations in their outermost shells. Because of
30
this common electron conguration, the chemical properties of each RE element are similar. 31
One example of glasses containing a RE is the lanthanum borate system, which exhibits
32
a high refractive index due to the presence of heavy RE ions.
