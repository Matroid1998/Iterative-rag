Description:
A five-membered aromatic ring containing two adjacent nitrogens.

Pyrazole is a fivemembered aromatic ring containing two adjacent nitrogens. The pyrroletype 
nitrogen with a lone pair of electrons involved in aromaticity of the pyrazole ring. The other 

pyridinetype sp2 hybridized nitrogen has its lone pair away and out of the plane from the ring 
structure 2. Hence the preferential protonation of pyrazole would be at N(2)nitrogen. The 
resonance structures of protonated pyrazole (pyrazolium cation) are shown in scheme 1. N
