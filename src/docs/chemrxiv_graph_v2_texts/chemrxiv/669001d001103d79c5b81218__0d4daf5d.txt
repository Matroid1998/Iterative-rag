Description:
A rare metal with higher cost compared to nickel, used in electrocatalysis.

Text:
Nickel (alone or alloyed with iron in stainless steel) is the catalyst employed at both 
the cathode and the anode of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers 6, for the 
electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) 7,8 and Oxygen Evolution 
Reaction (OER) 9,10. Its relatively high activity and far lower cost with respect to 
rare Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) make it the electrocatalyst of choice for the 
wider diffusion of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) 11,12. AWE is already used to 
manufacture around 1 of the global annual output of hydrogen. Using electricity 
from renewable energy sources, the technology will be widely deployed to produce 
solar (or green) hydrogen for electric mobility and other end energy uses 13.
