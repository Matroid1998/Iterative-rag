Description:
Known as sultams, they have applications in drug discovery, asymmetric synthesis, and food chemistry.

Text:
Cyclic sulfonamides, also known as sultams, have found diverse 
applications in drug discovery (e.g., the anticonvulsant sultiame or 
the antimicrobial taurolidine, as well as numerous leads and drug 
candidates), asymmetric synthesis (e.g., camphorsultam as a chiral 
auxiliary), agricultural and food chemistry (e.g., the artificial 
sweetener saccharin), and other areas.14 Taking into account the 
wellknown 
nonclassical 
isosterism 
of 
sulfonamide 
and 
carboxamide moieties,5,6 sultams can be considered as three
dimensional mimetics of lactams (Figure 1, A). On the other hand, 
sultams can be also regarded as isosteres of saturated heterocyclic 
amines, which lack basicity at the physiological conditions but still 
retain capability of chemical modification at the NH moiety through 
its increased acidity.
