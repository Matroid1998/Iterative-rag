Description:
Used to prepare very thin films in the Black Lipid Membrane (BLM) experimental setup.

Text:
The membrane on which 
45 
PAMPA methods are based is artificially made and chosen depending on the membrane the assay 
46 
mimics. To this date, many variants of PAMPA have been published. The examples include DS
47 
PAMPA6, which mimics gastrointestinal absorption, bloodbrain barrier PAMPA7, SkinPAMPA8, or 
48 
nasalPAMPA9. Another longtimeknown experimental method of permeability measurement is BLM 
49 
(Black Lipid membrane), first published by Mueller et al.10. In this experimental setup, membranes are 
50 
prepared in the form of very thin lipid films.
