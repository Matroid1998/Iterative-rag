Description:
Each rhenium ion binds to the ligand through four atoms in the equatorial position and one atom in the approximately axial position.

Thus, there is no information regarding the 
electronic structure of the two oxidized species (1 and 12), 
specifically, the nature of the ReRe bonding in those oxidized 
forms. Therefore, computationally exploring the 10, 1, and 12 
complexes would shed light on the nature of metalmetal bonding 
in those species. The structure of 10 shows that each rhenium ion bounds to the 
ligand through four atoms in the equatorial position and one atom 
in the approximately axial position. Noticeably, there is a 
remarkable similarity between the structure of 10 and the landmark 
Re2Cl82 molecule18,19, if we consider just the bonded ligand in 
the equatorial position.
