Description:
A known osmolyte that preserves the physiological functions of proteins.

Text:
Small organic solutes in cells have various effects on proteins. For example, 
trimethylamine Noxide (TMAO, Figure S1a), which consists of NO and methyl (CH3) groups, 
has been found in deepsea fishes and is a known osmolyte that preserves the physiological 
functions of proteins.1 However, the preservation mechanism of the osmotic pressure is still 
under debate; the proposed explanations include an attractive direct interaction between TMAO 
and proteins2 or indirect interactions via structural changes of an aqueous solution as a molecular 
aggregate.3, 4 If the mechanism by which TMAO allows physiological functional preservation in 
proteins is clarified, it would make fundamental scientific contributions to, for example, the next 
generation of medicine by accelerating the development of artificial chaperones and 
understanding the mechanism of atherosclerosis.
