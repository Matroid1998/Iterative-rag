Description:
A gas that can be selectively adsorbed by materials for capture applications.

For CO2 capture applications, an ideal MOF will exhibit
structural stability, be robust to thermal fluctuations and con
taminant molecules, and display high species selectivity for
CO2. In the directair capture (DAC) of CO2, where con
centrations are around 400ppm10, selectively adsorbing only

CO2 is critical for deployable systems. There are numerous
different mechanisms for tuning a material to be highly se
lective for CO211, including gating of the kinetic diameter12,
geometry gating13, and aminefunctionalization14. The latter
approach is the focus of this paper. In this situation, an envi
ronment exists that selectively allows the adsorption of CO2
via a chemical bond1518, socalled chemisorption. Amine functionalization refers to the attachment of amines
to the open metal sites of the MOF.
