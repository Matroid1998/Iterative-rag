Description:
Involved in the lithiation-delithiation process of silicon anodes in batteries.

Text:
Silicon (Si), owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity (3579 mAhg), is regarded as one 
of the most attractive anode materials for next generation lithium batteries.1,2 However, practical 
application of Si anode is severely hampered by its large volume expansionshrinkage during 
lithiationdelithiation (dischargingcharging). This expansionshrinkage may give rise to anode 
particle pulverization, breaking the electrical contact between particles, and resulting in rapid 
capacity attenuation and limited cycle life.15 For better development of Si anode, it is essential to 
understand the underlying mechanism of the lithiationdelithiation process and the corresponding 
microstructure evolution. However, the lithiationdelithiation of Si anode involves complex 
transitions between the crystalline and amorphous phases, making any comprehensive analysis a 
challenging task. In addition, the stress state of an anode particle depends strongly on the 
lithiationdelithiation mechanism.
