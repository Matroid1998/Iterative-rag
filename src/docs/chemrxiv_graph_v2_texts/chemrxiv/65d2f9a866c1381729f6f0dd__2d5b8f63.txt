Description:
A greenhouse gas for which emission factors are supplemented with direct measurements in petroleum and natural gas systems.

Recent proposed changes to Subpart W for petroleum
35
and natural gas systems in the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) contain im
36
provements to the existing calculation methodologies to supplement calculated CH4 emission
37
factors with direct measurements.6 Further, in December 2023 the US Environmental Protec
38
tion Agency (EPA) published the nal OOOOb New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)
39
and OOOOc Emission Guidelines (EG) for oil and gas sites which includes standards to
40
allow operators to use continuous monitoring solutions as an alternative means of emission
41
detection.7 In order for measurements to improve the accuracy of emission inventories, or for
42
continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMs) to provide a robust equivalent alternative
43
to prescribed leak detection methods, it is imperative that measurements from these systems
44
are repeatable, accurate, and unbiased.
