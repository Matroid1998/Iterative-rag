Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules, affecting friction in nanochannels.

Text:
Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations predict that defects in the 
graphitic plane will cause extra friction to the movement of water inside the nanochannels10. The effect on the friction is predicted to increase with the number of hydrogen bonds 
between the water molecules and the defects10. While simulation studies offer a great 
understanding of the underlying transport mechanism11, an experimental observation is still 
lacking. Experimental studies so far mainly focus on how the ionic transport occurs in these 
nanochannels3. However, a systematic study on the water transport in graphenebased 
nanochannels with water attraction impurities has remained elusive.
