Description:
A fluorinated proton permeable membrane used to isolate electrodes from the electrolyte.

Text:
In the cell containing the WE, the 
acidity is regulated by a voltage bias applied respect to the reference 
cell, which controls the release or adsorption of protons by 
molecules functionalized in the WE. The electrodes are isolated from 
the electrolyte using a fluorinated proton permeable membrane 
(Nafion)14. The diffusion barriers assure that the number of protons 
in each cell is stable for periods much longer than the dissociation 
dynamics, while the small dimensions of the cell assure a rapid 
feedback of the reactions in the cell. The electrochemically 
generated acid released protons, free of counter ions and free to 
interact with the elements of the electrolyte. Thanks to these 
characteristics, the acidity can be controlled and estimated by the 
faradaic currents.
