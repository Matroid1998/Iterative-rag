The polymer industry is constantly evolving, facing numerous challenges in the current 
transition to a more sustainable society. The tire and nylon sectors depend heavily on 1,3
butadiene (BD) as a monomer.1 BD is traditionally obtained through the steam cracking of 
naphtha as a byproduct of ethylene production; its market is currently under tension mainly 
due to the rising of shale gas.2 In fact, the weight ratio butadieneethylene sits at around 0.02 
for ethane cracking, the main component of shale gas, compared to 0.13 for naphtha cracking.1 
This difference could lead to a further unbalance in the BD market. Thus, alternative and more 
sustainable ways to produce BD are needed.
