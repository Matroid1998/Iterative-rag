Metal used in device interconnects, requiring a diffusion barrier to prevent atom diffusion into the surrounding dielectric.

Law, device interconnects will continue to provide stern challenges. Several layers of interconnect lines are needed to connect all the transistors in a device. The closer the intercon
nect is to the transistors the smaller it must be, resulting in extremely high aspect ratio structures at the lowest
device levels. Currently, interconnects are made with Cu metal. To create a functioning interconnect, a diffusion
barrier and a seed layer or liner (also referred to as adhesion promoter) need to be deposited in the interconnect via. As the name suggests, the role of the diffusion barrier is to prevent the diffusion of Cu atoms into the surrounding
dielectric, while the liner material promotes deposition of smooth, conductive Cu films.

Used in interconnects for electronic devices.

Text:
Current diffusion barriers,
such as TaN, are unable to promote the deposition of conductive Cu without the addition of the liner material. Common liner materials include Ta and Ru. The barrier and liner materials take up the limited available volume
in the interconnect via, to the point that even with modern deposition methods such as Atomic Layer Deposition
(ALD) they cannot be thinned further without compromising their efficiency and this means that insufficient volume
remains in the via to deposit the amount of Cu needed for a functioning interconnect. 8, 9 New developments in
interconnects are clearly needed in order to drive further advances in electronic devices.
