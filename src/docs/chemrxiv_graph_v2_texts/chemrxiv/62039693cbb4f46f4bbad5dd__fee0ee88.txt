In order to analyze the effect of 
halogen substitution, in the parent molecule, CIMPPC (26I), the position of iodine atom is 
replaced by bromine, chlorine and fluorine atoms respectively and which are designated as 26Br, 
26Cl, 26F. Similarly the positions of hydrogen atom in the parent molecule CIMPPC, 16H, 18H 
and 20H are replaced by iodine, bromine, chlorine and fluorine atoms respectively which are
