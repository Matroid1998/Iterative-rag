Description:
Suitable for hydroamidation reactions with phenylsubstituted alkynes.

Text:
To the 
best of our knowledge, there were only two hydroamidation 
reactions of internal alkyne which meet the requirements of 
atomic economic of ideal hydroamidation1819. Indisputably, 
make clear the mechanisms of these reactions are very 
important, for which can provide direct insights to broaden 
substrate scope and improve efficiency of such reaction. In 2016, Cui et al. reported first example of 
hydroamidation of phenylsubstituted alkyne with Ru(II) as 
catalyst19. The reaction proceed under relatively high 
temperature (90 ) and the substrates scope of amides is 
very 
limited, 
only 
the 
N1benzylN2,N2
diisopropyloxalamide and its analogs are suitable for this 
reaction. In 2006 Kozmin et al. reported the first example of 
hydroamidation of internal alkynes18.
