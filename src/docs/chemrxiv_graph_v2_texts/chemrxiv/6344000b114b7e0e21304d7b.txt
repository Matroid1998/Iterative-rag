Description:
A substrate in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isopropylmalate synthase where the rate-limiting step changes upon allosteric inhibition.

Text:
the alteration of reaction rate andor substrate 
affinity upon ligand binding to, mutation of, or posttranslational modification at a site 
remote from the active site, is a fundamental regulatory mechanism of biochemical 
reactions.11,12 It finds applications in drug discovery to facilitate drugtarget selectivity as 
allosteric sites tend to be less conserved than active sites across homologous proteins,13,14 and 
in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology, where allosteric control may need to be 
introduced or, more often, eliminated.15,16 While enzymes subject to allosteric regulation by 
ligand binding can be broadly classified as Ktype, those where substrate affinity is altered, 
and Vtype, those where the steadystate catalytic rate constant (kcat) is altered, the specific 
kinetic steps affected can vary depending on the enzyme.13,1719 For instance, in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis isopropylmalate synthase, the ratelimiting step changes from 
product release to chemistry upon allosteric inhibition by leucine.17 The role of protein
