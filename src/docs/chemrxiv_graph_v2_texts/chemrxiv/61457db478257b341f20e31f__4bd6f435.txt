The neutralization of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) continues to be a pressing area of
18
interest for the safe and eective removal of these hazardous compounds. Among the various
19
CWAs, the most nefarious are organophosphate nerve agents (such as sarin), which contain
20
PO, POC, and PC bonds that enable lethal phosphorylating mechanisms.1 Over the
21
past few decades, a variety of destruction and neutralization methods have been used to safely
22
eliminate these hazardous compounds.
