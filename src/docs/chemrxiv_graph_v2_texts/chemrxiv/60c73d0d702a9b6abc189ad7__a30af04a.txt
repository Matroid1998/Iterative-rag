Description:
Simple tetrahedral building blocks that connect by their edges to form zeolite topologies.

Text:
Metastable phases of SiO2, also known as siliceous zeolites, are typically formed by crys
tallisation in the presence of templating agents.1 This produces nanoporous structures that
have applications in adsorption, separation and gas storage.2 More than 200 unique zeolite
topologies have been observed from simple tetrahedral SiO4 building blocks connected by
their edges, though much less have been obtained as pure silica compounds. This structural diversity of zeolitic frameworks induces a wide variety of their properties,
including geometric characteristics (e.g. channel dimensionality, connectivity and pore space)
which are directly relevant for adsorptionrelated applications, but also in physical proper
ties such as mechanical behaviour.
