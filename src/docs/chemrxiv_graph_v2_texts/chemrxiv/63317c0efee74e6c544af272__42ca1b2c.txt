Description:
A compound with metal-metal bonding involving overlapping d orbitals forming eight molecular orbitals.

Therefore, a simple molecular orbital 
diagram of Re2Cl82 (illustrated systematically in Figure1b) can 
provide a basic understanding of the nature of metalmetal 
bonding of 10. The four dorbitals on each metal centre overlap to 
form eight molecular orbitals that are ! ,  , and  and their 
antibonding counterparts. Populating those orbitals with ten
