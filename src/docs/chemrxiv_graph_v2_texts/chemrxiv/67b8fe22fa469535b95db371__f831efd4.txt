Description:
Sacrificial antiozonants added to tire rubber to extend their use.

identified N(1,3dimethylbutyl)Nphenylpphenylenediamine quinone 
(6PPDQ) as the cause of rain driven mass dieoff events of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the 
Pacific Northwest  a phenomenon known as Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome (URMS).1 Para
phenylenediamine quinones (PPDQs) are derived from the ozonation of paraphenylenediamines (PPDs), 
sacrificial antiozonants added at 0.42 wt to tire rubber to extend their use.1 6PPDQ and structurally 
related PPDQ analogues have been observed to enter urban waterways and have been quantified in road 
dust, sediments, snowmelt, fish tissues, and other matrices.28 6PPDQ toxicity has been established for 
other salmonid species, including brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis),911 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus 
mykiss),9,10 and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush),12 but coho salmon appear to be the most susceptible 
with LC50 values ranging from 4195 ngL.13,14 6PPDQ appears to exhibit stereoselective toxicity, as the S 
enantiomer was recently reported to be 2.6 times more toxic to coho salmon than the R enantiomer.9,15 
The 2024 U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association Preliminary (Stage 1) Alternatives Analysis Report proposes 
several alternatives to 6PPD,16 including structural analogs where alkylaryl groups (R1 and R2) are varied 
(Figure 1 and Figure S1).
