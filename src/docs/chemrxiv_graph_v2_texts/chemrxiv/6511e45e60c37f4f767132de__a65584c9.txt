Synthetic strategies towards bbranched amino acids 
A breakthrough was reached upon recognition that the bbranched 
amino acid motifs for both 3 and 4 could, in principle, be derived 
from aziridine ring openings (Figure 1). While addition to aziridines 
has previously been demonstrated as a useful strategy for the 
synthesis of bbranched amino acids,21 very few examples exist for 
comparable additions to acarbonyl, baryl aziridines as was 
necessitated in the case of 2. In general, addition to aziridines 
requires the use of electronwithdrawing Nactivators (such as tosyl 
or nosyl protecting groups), which could potentially introduce 
further synthetic issues.
