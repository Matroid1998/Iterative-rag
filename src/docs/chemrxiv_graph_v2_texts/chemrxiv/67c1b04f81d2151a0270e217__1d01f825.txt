Description:
Serves as a catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells for electrochemical half-reactions.

With growing concerns about global warming being a major
challenge of our time, alternatives to fossil fuel are sought
across many branches of science. One approach is the im
provement of fuel cell technology.14 In hydrogen fuel cells, the
high demand for platinum catalysts for the two electrochemical
halfreactions limits both sustainability and rollout on a large
scale.1,3,5,6 Especially for the kinetically hindered oxygen re
duction reaction (ORR), where four electrons are transferred,
the platinum load is high.58 In the search for alternative cat
alysts, singleatom metalNC catalysts9,10 and among them
especially FeNC catalysts,57,1115 have been found promising
and hence became a highly active field of research.
