Description:
Reduced in the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction to produce ammonia.

Text:
The synthesis of ammonia as a precursor to fertilizer is estimated to support the nutritional needs 
of over 40 of the worlds population.1,2 Furthermore, ammonia is a promising carbonfree fuel and 
hydrogen carrier for applications in sustainable transportation and energy storage. Ammonia is most 
commonly synthesized by the HaberBosch process, using hydrogen produced from methane reforming 
and energy generated from hydrocarbon combustion, and accounts for nearly 2 of global carbon 
emissions.1 There are two primary approaches to decarbonize ammonia synthesis the Green Haber
Bosch process using hydrogen produced via water electrolysis3 or solar thermochemical water splitting,4 
and the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).5 NRR provides the advantages of distributed, 
loadmatching production to generate ammonia near its point of use, and can provide lower capital and
