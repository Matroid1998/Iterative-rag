Description:
Synthesized with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23) and studied for racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.

Tillys group synthesized expanded nhelicenes (B) 
with three different lengths (n  15, 19, 23), and compared 
the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.8) By 
contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported extended 
ncarbohelicenes (C) with three different lengths (n  5, 7, 
9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, 
and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.9) As another 
type of helicene analog, heterohelicenes, in which heteroa
toms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also 
attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence 
and redox properties.10,11) Generally, heterohelicenes are 
more electronrich compared with carbohelicenes, thus 
their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized 
with the extension.
