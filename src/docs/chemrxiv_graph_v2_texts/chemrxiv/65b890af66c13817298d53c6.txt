Description:
A unique class of cumulene molecules with the general formula RRCCO, serving as valuable reagents and intermediates in organic synthesis.

Ketenes comprise a unique class of cumulene molecules with the general formula 
RRCCO. Initially described by Wedekind as a reactive intermediate in 1901,1 Staudinger 
reported the first synthesis and characterization of a ketene molecule, diphenyl ketene 
(RRPh), in 1905.2 Since that time, despite their relative instability, ketenes have served as 
valuable reagents and intermediates in organic synthesis.3 4 Currently, however, the smallest 
homolog (RRH, ketene, ethenone) of the series is receiving attention as a potentially 
significant public health hazard,5 since it has been identified in aerosols generated by 
commercial vaping products.6 7 
The chemical and toxicological properties of ketene mirror those of phosgene 
(Cl2CO), a WWI chemical warfare agent, as a reactive acylating agent and respiratory 
poison.8 There is a lack of human toxicity data for ketene exposure.
