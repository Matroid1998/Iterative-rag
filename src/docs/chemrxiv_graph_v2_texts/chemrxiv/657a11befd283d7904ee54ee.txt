involving the generation of SO4 (eqs. 13) followed by its reaction either with Ru(NH3)62 (eq. 4) or by direct reduction at the electrode (eq. 5).10 Eqs. 4 and 5 represent quenching reactions, 
preventing SO4 from participating in the intended oxidation of the alcohol substrate. Cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) studies performed using glassy carbon macroelectrodes, along with finite
difference simulations, were employed to estimate the rate constants of eq. 2 as  2  105 M1s1 
and provided lower limits for eq. 3 ( 1  106 s1), and eq.
