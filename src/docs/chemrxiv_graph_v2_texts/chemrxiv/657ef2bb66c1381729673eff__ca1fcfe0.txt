Description:
Undergo substitution reactions to form alkyl chlorides.

Text:
The multifaceted reactivity of alkyl chlorides makes them important 
building blocks for the assembly of architecturally complex C(sp3)
rich molecules (Figure 1A)1. Despite their wellrecognized utilities, 
methods to access alkyl chlorides directly from readily available rea
gents remain rare2, beyond classical syntheses from Markovnikov ad
ditions to alkenes3 and substitution reactions of alcohols4. One area 
that has resulted in the evolution of new technologies for the synthe
sis of complex alkyl chlorides has been transformations based on the 
difunctionalization of alkenes. In the 1950s, Meerwein and cowork
ers developed a radicalbased approach to alkyl chloride synthesis 
through the arylchlorination of alkenes (Figure 1B)5a, b.
