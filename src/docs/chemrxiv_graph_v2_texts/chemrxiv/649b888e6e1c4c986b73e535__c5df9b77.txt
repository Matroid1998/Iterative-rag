Description:
Superconductors that are not traditional metals but doped oxides behaving like bad metals.

As explained in 5, the superconducting cuprates are
very different from conventional superconductors, in the fact
that they are not traditional metals, but instead doped oxides
that behave like bad metals. Often, the pairing for supercon
duction does not happen with electrons, but instead with the
doped holes  which act as quasiparticles that pair up and
behave like the Cooper pairs, but with opposite charge. It
is still not fully known what drives the pairing mechanism
to get superconductivity in these materials. Materials with
these properties are deemed in the category of a typeII
superconductor. Other types of superconductors have since
been discovered beyond the cuprate family such as heavy
fermionbased, buckminsterfullerinebased, carbonallotrope,
ironpnictogenbased, nickelbased, and strontiumruthenate
superconductors among others.
