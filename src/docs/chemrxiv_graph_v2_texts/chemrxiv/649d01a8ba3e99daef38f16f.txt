Description:
An anode material for Li batteries with the highest theoretical capacity at 3860 mAh g1 and the lowest possible electrochemical potential, 3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode.

Lithium metal has been the holy grail of anode materials for Li batteries, since the first usage in the 
1960s, boasting the highest theoretical capacity at 3860 mAh g1, the lowest possible electrochemical 
potential, 3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, and a low mass density.14 Despite its desirable 
parameters, safety issues stemming from dendritic growth of lithium, short circuiting and subsequent 
ignition of the liquid electrolyte, have led to its replacement by the graphite anode in commercial 
lithium ion batteries.14 Through the usage of nonflammable solid electrolytes which are compatible 
with lithium metal, such as the oxide garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), safety concerns can be remedied and 
a resurgence of the lithium metal anode is possible.5,6 
The problem of dendritic growth remains though, still present in solid electrolytes, which are prone 
to being cracked by lithium dendrites, even when the material is mechanically stronger than lithium 
metal.

Description:
Plating can lead to dendrite formation, causing mechanical stress and potential fracture in solid electrolytes.

Text:
This can happen at current densities as low as 0.1 mAcm at room temperature. 79 The precise 
mechanism of dendrite formation in solid electrolytes is far from fully explored but one explanation is 
that inhomogeneous current distribution, sometimes named current focusing, leads to preferential 
lithium plating, accelerating the buildup of mechanical stress in the ceramic until it is released in 
fracture of the material.1013 
Recently it was found that directed stresses in the material allow for guiding the growing crack in a 
certain direction. With increasing in plane compressive stress, the path of the growing crack aligns 
more and more with the stress direction, depending on the initial crack angle, as the path of least 
resistance from the mechanical perspective diverges from the electrochemical one.
