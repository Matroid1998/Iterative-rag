Characterization of zeoliteencapsulated subnanometre clusters is experimentally challenging, 
owing to the size resolution limitations of most imaging methods, the sensitivity of zeolites to beam 
damage in electron microscopes and the lack of sensitivity of spectroscopic methods towards the 
low loadings of metal (often  0.1 wt ). (1315) High resolution TEM imaging remains a preferred 
method for characterising metal atoms and clusters,2, 7 and has been successfully employed for 
detecting and determining cluster size, coordination environment and oxidation state, in 
cooperation with EXAFS and XPS.8 Nevertheless, ex situ characterization of asprepared or spent
