Description:
A greenhouse gas that needs to be removed to balance the atmospheric carbon footprint.

The 
primary objective of the net zero3 is to achieve carbon neutrality by 
significantly reducing carbon emissions to a level that can be 
absorbed and stored sustainably by natural mechanisms and 
additional carbon dioxide removal methods, thereby ensuring a 
balanced atmospheric carbon footprint of zero. Presently, the energy 
sector is accountable for approximately threequarters of 
greenhouse gas emissions, thus playing a pivotal role in mitigating 
the adverse impacts of climate change.
