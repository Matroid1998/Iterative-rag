Description:
Can be used as a dopant in synthetic valleriite and tochilinite.

Text:
Valleriite (Fe3,Cu)S2x(Mg,Fe,Al)(OH)2 
occurs in large amounts in the Norilsk CuNi ore provenance 2628, largely in socalled cuprous 
ores, which remain uninvolved in industrial processing because of, among other reasons, poor 
understanding its structure and properties. Recently, we developed a hydrothermal method for manufacturing almost impurityfree 
flakes of 10200 nm in lateral size and 1020 nm thick of synthetic valleriite 29 and tochilinite 
30, including doped with Al, Li, 3d metals, and examined some of their main characteristics 
using XRD, TEM, EDS, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflection electron energy loss 
spectroscopy, Mssbauer, Raman and UVvisNIR spectroscopies, together with magnetization, 
impedance, zeta potential and other measurements 3132.
