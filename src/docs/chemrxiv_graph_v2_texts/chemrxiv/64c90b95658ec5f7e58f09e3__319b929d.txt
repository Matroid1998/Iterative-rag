Zeolites, having the general formula (M2n OAl2O3xSiO2yH2O), ncation valence, 
109 
(Sherman 1999), are a group of natural or synthetic hydrated aluminasilicate minerals 
110 
with reactive pores of molecular dimensions that allow configurational diffusion and thus 
111 
entrapment of target anions or cations in the zeolite pores (Masuda, 2003; Widayat and 
112 
Annisa, 2017). The zeolite polyhedral (tetrahedral) structure consists of a framework of
