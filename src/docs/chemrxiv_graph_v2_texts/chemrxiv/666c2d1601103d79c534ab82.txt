Lithiumion batteries are an inevitable part of energy storage in our modern world. However, 
conventional lithiumion batteries are expected to run into performance limits.1 To push battery 
performance beyond these limitations, it is critical to investigate alternative battery 
technologies. One particularly promising technology is solidstate batteries (SSB). By replacing 
separators and liquid electrolytes of lithiumion batteries with solidstate ion conductors, the 
usage of Limetal anodes and thus higher energy densities can potentially be enabled.24 
Further advantages are increased mechanical stability, the absence of leakage and a 
potentially improved thermal safety.5 
Solidstate batteries utilize composite electrodes, consisting of the electrochemically active 
material, the solid electrolyte (SE) and, if necessary, additives such as binders or conductive 
carbons, e.g., vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF).

Description:
Responsible for electronic conduction in composite systems.

In these composite systems, a sufficiently 
high ionic (ion) and electronic (e) conductivity, as well as balancing of the two transport 
quantities is of paramount importance to enable high electrode utilizations and to avoid reaction 
fronts during charging and discharging.6,7 
On the one hand, charge carrier transport can be decisively influenced by varying the 
volumetric ratios of the electrode components given that the electrochemically active material 
and carbon additives are solely responsible for the electronic conduction, while the solid 
electrolyte exclusively conducts ions.8,9 With that, altering the SE content in composite anodes, 
such as Li4Ti5O12Li7P2S8IC10 or SiLi6PS5Cl (LPSCl)C11, can facilitate changes in the 
effective ionic conductivity over orders of magnitude.
