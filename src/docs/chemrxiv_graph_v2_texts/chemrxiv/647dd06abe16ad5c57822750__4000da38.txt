Description:
Present in higher plants, contrasting with chlorophyllc in diatom FCP complexes.

Text:
The large amount of fucoxanthin carotenoids contained in the FCP complexes en
ables the absorption of sunlight in the bluegreen region, which allows diatoms to perform
photosynthesis in a marine environment6. Furthermore, the presence of chlorophyllc (Chlc)
molecules in the diatom FCP complexes, as opposed to the Chlb present in higher plants,
adds towards this goal. The first crystallographic structure of an FCP complex belongs to the diatom Phaeodacty
lum tricornutum and shows a dimeric unit7 whereas later studies on the organism Chaetoceros
gracilis found different tetrameric as well as monomeric units near the PSII core of those
diatoms8,9. Although the polypeptide structures of these FCP complexes are quite similar,
they differ in the chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid content.
