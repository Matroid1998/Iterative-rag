Description:
The ligand of choice for many Ni-catalyzed cross-couplings that invoke open-shell intermediates.

Moreover, while 4,4ditertbutylbipyridine (tBubpy) is 
the ligand of choice for many Nicatalyzed crosscouplings 
that invoke openshell intermediates,3033 only two exam
ples of formal (tBubpy)NiI species have been structurally 
characterized Hazaris (tBubpy)NiICl2 and Noceras (t
Bubpy)Ni1.5(quinuclidine)Cl2Cl.18,34 
Importantly, 
these 
complexes do not replicate the behavior of (tBubpy)NiI spe
cies in catalysis due to irreversible dimerization of reactive 
(tBubpy)NiIX. While in situ generation of monomeric (t
Bubpy)NiI species has clarified the reactivity of important 
catalytic intermediates,35,36 these approaches are more 
challenging to apply to future catalyst design and mechanis
tic studies than stoichiometric synthesis. Strategies to enable the synthesis of previously unknown 
NiI complexes create downstream opportunities for more 
effective Ni catalysis.
