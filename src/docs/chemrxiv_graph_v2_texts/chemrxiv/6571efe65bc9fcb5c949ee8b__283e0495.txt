Involved in the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction during CO2 reduction.

Text:
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) using renewable 
electricity has emerged as a promising avenue to address anthropogenic CO2 
emissions and combat the global energy crisis.13 Considering the cost of electricity 
and separation, and the potential value in downstream synthesis through Fisher
Tropsch chemistry, carbon monoxide (CO) is regarded as an economically viable 
choice among the potential eCO2RR products.4,5 However, the formidable activation 
barrier of the CO bond in CO2, alongside the competitive hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER), hinder its practical application.5,6 Hence, the quest for a catalyst 
displaying both suitable activity and selectivity becomes pivotal for the practical 
realization of CO2toCO conversion.
