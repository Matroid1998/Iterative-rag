Description:
A commercially available compound used in the synthesis of NH()tetrahydro deoxycytisine.

Text:
We have recently developed a semisynthesis of an NH chiral diamine ()1 from naturally 
occurring product ()cytines. This chiral diamine 1 has proved to be a potential multifunctional chiral 
ligand for various mechanistically unrelated reactions.19 However, the access of the corresponding 
enantiomer NH()tetrahydro deoxycytisine was not possible in a similar fashion due to the availability 
of ()cytisine. Figure 1. Ligand properties and its compatible reaction. The total synthese of structurally similar sparteine,1013 cytisine,14 aloperine15 have been 
beautifully demonstrated by colleagues in the past. Herein, we report a modified practical synthetic 
approach for the access of NH()tetrahydro deoxycytisine from commercially available piperidine. Figure 2. Two enantiomers of NHdiamine with downwardfacing conformation ring.

Description:
A compound that undergoes N-chlorination with NCS.

Text:
NChlorination of piperidine 2 with NCS gave corresponding NCl adduct which was then treated 
with KOH without further purification to give the imine 7 was reacting with ester carboxylic acid 5 in
