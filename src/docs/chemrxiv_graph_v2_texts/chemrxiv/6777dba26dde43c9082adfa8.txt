Description:
A material that can be dissolved in water at room temperature and departs from the ideal perovskite structure.

This may imply for example an overall facilitated formation
of defects or enhanced ion dynamics in the confined systems as compared to the bulk1517. Over the last years, different delamination strategies were employed for such freestanding
oxides. Most popular are the chemical exfoliation routes involving the wetetching of a sacri
ficial layer. Here, strontium aluminate (SAO) is a widely applied material as it easily can be
dissolved in water at room temperature1820, same solubility applies to SrO21. However, SAO
departs from the ideal perovskite structure, lowering the epitaxial quality of possible perovskite
oxide films grown on top, even though it can offer a low lattice mismatch to the chosen thin film via
cation stoichiometry control10,22.
