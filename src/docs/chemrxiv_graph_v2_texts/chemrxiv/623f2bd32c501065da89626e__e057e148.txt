Description:
Used in catalysis for CC and C-heteroatom bond formation and dehydrogenative cross coupling.

Text:
Combinations of photoredox and nickel catalysis have been widely used in CC and C
heteroatoms bond formation,12 and a recent report by Murakami and coworkers demonstrated 
dehydrogenative cross coupling with nickel complexes.13 Inspired by the recent reports11b, 13, 14
