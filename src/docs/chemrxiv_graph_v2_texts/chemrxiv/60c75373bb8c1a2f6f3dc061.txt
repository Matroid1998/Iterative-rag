Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds with urea, contributing to the hydrogen bond network.

in an experimental and computational approach, showed an enhanced stability of 
Cytochromec (Cytc) in the presence of amino acidbased biodegradable choline IL.45 Reline is also found 
to protect Ckit GQuadruplex DNA from severely high temperature.46 Hydrogen bond mediated 
electrostatic interaction plays a pivotal role in stabilizing reline microstructure. ESPR, Neutron scattering, 
and molecular dynamics studies establish the position of the chloride ion at the closer proximity of urea and 
hydroxyl group of choline cation.19,47,48 The common outcome of all these studies is the hydrogen bond 
formation between the chloride ion and the urea molecule, which in turn accommodate the urea within the 
hydrogen bond network. Posada et al. confirmed an inhomogeneity in the structure of reline, despite the
