Description:
A greenhouse gas commonly captured from dilute sources such as flue gas.

The separation and purification of chemicals are highly important processes in the
chemical industry and account for 45  55  of their energy consumption 1, 2. The
capture of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, from dilute sources (e.g. flue gas which
generally contains 4  30  CO2 in a mixture with N2) 3 has generally been achieved at
an industrial scale using alkanoamines such as monoethanolamine (MEA) 4. However,
the chemical instability, their corrosiveness, and the cost of many alkanoamines limit
their widespread application. An estimated 60  80 of the total cost of the carbon
capture and sequestration (CCS) process is estimated to originate from procedures
pertaining to the utilization of the amine solutions 5.

Description:
A gas that can be captured and separated using adsorption-based processes with porous sorbents.

Text:
In contrast, adsorptionbased
processes for the capture and separation of CO2 using porous sorbents have been
proposed as a promising energy and costefficient alternative. Pressurevacuum and
temperatureswing (PSVA, and TSA) adsorption have been explored at both lab and
pilot scales to successfully drive the capture and regeneration of CO2 in sorbents such as
zeolites 69, porous carbons 3, 10, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) porous
coordination polymers (PCPs) 1113. Although the running costs of such processes
using porous sorbents offer significant benefits as compared to CO2 capture using amine
compounds, problems with these techniques still exist and are related to e.g. large energy
consumptions for CO2 capture in feed gas mixtures containing low concentrations of CO2
(i.e.
