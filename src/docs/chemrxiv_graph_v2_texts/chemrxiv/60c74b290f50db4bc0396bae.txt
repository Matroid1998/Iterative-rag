Description:
Used as micelles in NMR studies of a truncated SARSCoV channel.

Text:
The mutations are located far away 
from the targeted inhibitor binding site (Nterminus channel entrance and lumen), therefore they shall 
have no effect on the screening results. The only available deposition for the E protein in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the NMR set of 16 
structures of a truncated SARSCoV channel in lysomyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol micelles (PDB 
5X29 10, see also Table 1 and Fig. 1). While these NMR models are lacking precision of Xray 
structures, they offer several snapshots of the channel dynamics, which could be advantageous in the 
docking studies. It appears that the channel, and, specifically, its pore fluctuates wildly. Depicted on 
Fig. 2 are the lumen radii calculated with HOLE program 11. The narrowest part of the channel could
