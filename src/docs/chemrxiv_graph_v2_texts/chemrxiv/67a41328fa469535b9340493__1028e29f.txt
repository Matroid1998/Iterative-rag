Description:
Versatile building blocks for synthesizing gemdifluoroalkenes.

Text:
In recent decades, trifluoromethyl olefins have evolved as versatile building blocks for synthesizing 
gemdifluoroalkenes, either through SN2type nucleophilic attack with organometallic reagents or 
through the increasingly popular Giese reactions, facilitated by the fluoride elimination of the 
trifluoromethyl carbanion intermediates (Scheme 1a) 1828. Particularly, the advent of photoredox catalysis
