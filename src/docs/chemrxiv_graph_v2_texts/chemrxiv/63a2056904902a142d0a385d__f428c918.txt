Description:
Reagents used in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions to create biaryl compounds.

To address these limitations, our group has utilized 
DNAcompatible onstrand reactions with simple non
fluorescent building blocks to afford a modular 
approach to screen the performance of internal FMR 
nucleobase surrogates.30,31 Initial efforts utilized a 4
bromoaniline (4BrA) building block containing an (S)
glycol backbone for onstrand SuzukiMiyaura cross
coupling reactions32 with arylboronic acids to create a 
variety of pushpull biaryl probes.30 We also utilized an 
(S)glycol3formylindole (3FI) building block for on
strand Knoevenagel condensations with heterocyclic 
quaternary salts for insertion of cyanineindole 
hemicyanines.31 However, both methods placed 
rotatable probe bonds (RPBs) in close proximity to 
neighboring bases of the singlestranded DNA (SS), 
leading to a restricted environment with high 
background signal and minimal lightup fluorescence 
upon hybridization. Additionally, both linear dye types 
caused considerable duplex destabilization.
