Description:
Precursors for diarylketones via palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling.

Text:
Based on this mechanism, 
we envisioned that this reaction could be utilized as a unified syn
thesis of multiply arylated alkanes from diarylketones (Figure 1D). Diarylketones are inexpensive, readily available basic chemicals 
that can also be generated from aryl carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, 
and esters in a single step by palladiumcatalyzed crosscoupling.18 
In general, diarylketones have an electrondeficient carbonyl, and 
phosphine oxide is able to attack the carbonyl, which would then 
undergo a 1,2phosphaBrook rearrangement to produce dia
rylphosphinates.
