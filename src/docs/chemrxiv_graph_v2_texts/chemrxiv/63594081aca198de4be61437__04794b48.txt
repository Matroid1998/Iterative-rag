Description:
An antihypertensive tripeptide derived from milk casein.

Text:
In this work, to show the proof of concept, we have 
considered two antihypertensive tripeptides Isoleucine
ProlineProline (IPP) and LeucineLysineProline (LKP) 
derived from milk casein 30. The FET sensor is immersed 
in an electrolyte with SiO2 as the gate oxide. (3
Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) is deposited on SiO2 as 
a linker to facilitate the immobilization of the oligopeptides 
29, 31, 32. The presence of linker 1, 8, 11 and non
specific binding 13, 5, 10 can be extracted by 
calibrating the sensor. The variation in device behavior is 
captured by analyzing surface potential (o), 2nd gradient of o
