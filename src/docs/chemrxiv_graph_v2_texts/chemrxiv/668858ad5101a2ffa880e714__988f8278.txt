Description:
A component of poly(lactidecoglycolide) whose ratio with lactide can be varied to tailor drug release rates.

The first MP formulation, Lupron Depot, was approved by the FDA in 1989 for delivery of a 
synthetic peptide to palliatively treat prostate cancer and then subsequently to treat central 
precocious puberty and endometriosis in 1993 and 2012, respectively 10,11. Nowadays, there 
are a number of clinicallyapproved MPbased LAIs for treatment of a wide range of indications 
with many more in development 1214. To date, the vast majority of FDAapproved polymer 
MPs are composed of poly(lactidecoglycolide) (PLGA) due to its biocompatibility and good 
safety profile. The composition of PLGA including the lactide to glycolide ratio, molecular weight, 
and end group chemistry as well as manufacturing processing parameters can be varied to tailor 
the physicochemical properties of the drugloaded MPs and drug release rate 2.
