Description:
A smaller nucleophile that can be added to ketones.

of the remaining carbonyl functionality 
was addressed. Different d1reagents either as acyl an
ion equivalents or masked carbonyl equivalents were 
considered.19 While bulky reagents such as lithiated di
thianes20 gave no conversion, smaller nucleophiles such 
as methoxyallenyllithium21 or cyanide were added suc
cessfully to the ketone (Scheme 4). In all cases, the 1,3
diketone was disarmed by in situ deprotonation with 
NaHMDS. Unfortunately, Xray and NMR analysis re
vealed that addition of all nucelophiles proceeded with 
the undesired facial selectivity. As all our attempts to 
obtain the epimeric tertiary alcohol were unsuccessful, 
we redirected our synthetic efforts towards 3epihy
patulin B (17). Attempted conversion of cyanohydrine 14 to the cor
responding ester 16 resulted in the desilylation and cy
anide elimination leading to ketone 4.

Description:
An irreversible reagent used in chemical reactions.

In contrast, the 
addition of methoxyallenyllithium is irreversible and 
methoxyallene 15 was isolated in 72 yield (Scheme 4).
