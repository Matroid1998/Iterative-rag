Small organic molecules play a major role towards affordable, orally consumable and non
toxic drug discovery. These small molecules have essentially driven the healthcare for the vast 
majority of the human population eversince, aspirin was synthesized in 1899 by Bayer.1 A few 
famous small molecule drugs include ibuprofen, retrovir, xarelto, cyclophosphamide, lipitor 
and vitrakvi.23 The efficacy of these drugs are highly sensitive towards the solubility of the
