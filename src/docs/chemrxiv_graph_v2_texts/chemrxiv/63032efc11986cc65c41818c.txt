Description:
Used in batteries that provide higher voltages but pose safety hazards due to flammable organic electrolytes.

Electronic thermometer, portable blood glucose
meter, portable ultrasound equipment, wearable electrocardiograph, cardiac pacemaker and so on. All of these portable
devices require stable power supply and small battery volume. Compared with flow batteries or cylindrical dry batteries,
coin battery with small volume is suitable to be applied in small precision device. Coin batteries come in many sizes
and vary greatly in diameter and thickness. Among the commercial coin batteries, the largest market share is the lithium
battery. Although lithium batteries can provide higher voltages, nonaqueous organic electrolytes in lithium batteries
have always been a safety hazard. Due to the flammability of organic electrolytes, lithium batteries can cause explosions
or fires during production, transportation and use.
