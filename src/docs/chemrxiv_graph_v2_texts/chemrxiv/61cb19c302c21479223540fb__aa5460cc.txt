Description:
Molecularly chemisorbed on Pt(111) and dissociates at higher temperatures.

Text:
On Pt(111), molecular
chemisorbed O2 molecules dissociate at higher tempera
tures with the oxygen atoms being preferentially to lat
tice sites apart from each other 8 which has also been
explained by a hot atom mechanism and conrmed in
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations 16. However, the direct identication of hot atom dynam
ics in reactions on surfaces by a combination of experi
ment and theory is hard to achieve. From an experimen
tal point of view this is due to the fact that the lifetime
of dynamical hot atom events is typically so short that
these events can not be directly detected.

Description:
Molecules that interact with stepped Pt surfaces.

Text:
As far as simu
lations are concerned, in recent years signicant progress
has been made by performing dynamical simulations that
include the coupling either to a phonon bath 15, 1721
or to electronhole pairs 2224. Such simulations have
provided very valuable insights into hot atom dynamics
in reactions Gambardella2001 at surfaces. Still it is fair
to say that there is not yet a general understanding about
the factors promoting hot atom reactions at surfaces. In this study, I will demonstrate that hot atom dynam
ics plays a critical role in the interaction of O2 molecules
with stepped Pt surfaces.
