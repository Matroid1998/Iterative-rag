A metal whose ion transport and interfacial stability can be enhanced by ether-aided super concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes.

and coworkers investigated an etheraided super concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte 
that could effectively enhance ion transport and interfacial stability toward Li metal and high 
voltage materials.3133 With the everincreasing attempt to boost the performance of SPEs, the 
use of high concentrated saltIL mixtures is predicated to improve both electrochemical 
stability and ion transport of PEObased SPEs by altering the ion dynamics and creating more 
efficient Li transport pathways within the polymer matrix. Although properties of binary IL electrolytes (i.e., either saltIL or polymerIL) have been 
extensively studied, the complex properties of ternary systems composed of a polymer and a 
high concentration saltIL mixture (HCIL) have been less explored.
