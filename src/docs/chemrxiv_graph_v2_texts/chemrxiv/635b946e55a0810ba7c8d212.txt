Description:
An element with an insulating nature and electrical conductivity of 1 x 10^-30 S m^-1 at room temperature.

Text:
The primary challenges faced by LiS technology include the insulating nature of 
43 
elemental sulfur (electrical conductivity of 1  1030 S m1 at room temperature) which reduces the 
44 
practical sulfur loading and utilisation achievable due to the need for nonactive conductive 
45 
additives 2. While cathodes can be manufactured with an idealised morphology, the dissolution 
46 
of sulfur into the electrolyte and precipitation of Li2S 1,3, and the subsequent reversal of this 
47 
process, manifest in significant alterations of the cathode morphology of the electrode during 
48 
cycling 4.

Description:
Can form large particles or become isolated, impairing rate performance or capacity in batteries.

Text:
This dynamic process significantly effects the distribution of sulfur after just a single 
49 
operating cycle and can result in the formation of large sulfur particles or the isolation of sulfur 
50 
and consequent impairment of rate performance or capacity 5. During prolonged cycling, these 
51 
processes also increase the cells impedance by reducing the electrochemically active surface 
52 
area in the battery. 6To date, the vast majority of modelling work in the LiS field has focussed 
53 
on zero and onedimensional models which do not account for these large microstructural 
54 
changes.715However, to develop a more complete understanding of the behaviour of LiS 
55 
batteries, threedimensional numerical modelling is required.
