Description:
A commercially available biodegradable polyester.

Text:
Biodegradable polymers are defined as natural or synthetic polymers that can be broken down by biological 
processes, typically into harmless natural compounds, over time1. These polymers have a wide range of 
biomedical applications, including drug delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds, sutures, and various 
implantable devices. They are designed to degrade gradually within the body, which can be advantageous 
for controlled release of drugs or supporting tissue regeneration2. Aliphatic polyesters have emerged as 
leading candidates due to their high susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis and degradation by 
microorganisms3. Commercially available biodegradable polyesters such as poly(butylene succinate) 
(PBS), poly(butylene succinatecoadipate) (PBSA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), 
poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), and poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) have shown great potential4.

Description:
A polyester derived from biobased monomers with good biocompatibility and biodegradability.

Text:
Besides biodegradability, for successful medical applications, other material properties such as 
biocompatibility, bioactivity, carefully considered mechanical properties, and processability needs to be 
considered during the design and fabrication process. By addressing these properties diligently, it becomes 
possible to develop medical devices that not only exhibit sustainability and biodegradability but also fulfill 
the functional requirements for effective medical applications5, 6. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is a polyester derived from biobased monomers and is receiving 
an increasing attention for its potential biomedical applications due to its good biocompatibility and 
biodegradability7. These properties make it suitable for various biomedical applications, including drug 
delivery systems and medical devices8, 9. Tissue engineering is the most widely researched biomedical 
field for PBS application where different forms (films, scaffolds) are being developed8.
