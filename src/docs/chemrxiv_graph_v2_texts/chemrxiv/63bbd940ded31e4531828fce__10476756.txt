Description:
A cathode that transforms to a NaPBA cathode after Na replaces K.

Text:
It is empirically expected that K would be extracted from the PBA framework after initial 
deintercalation, and Na would gradually replace K in following intercalation processes, 
which essentially transforms a KPBA cathode to a NaPBA cathode. Such kind of NaK
