Description:
An anion that can be selectively bound by fluorinated tetraurea macrocycles.

Text:
Additionally, macrocyclic structures18 offer greater encapsulation and binding site preorganisation, harbouring a more 
favourable and sizeselective environment for anion binding, which may result in high transport efficiency and antiHofmeister 
selectivity.19 The potent combination was demonstrated in previously reported Cl selective fluorinated tetraurea macrocycle, 
which achieved Cl binding constants 105 M1 in 50 aqueous mixtures and could perform highly efficient HCl co
transport.10,19 A recent study on a series of fluorinated macrocyclic bambus6urils demonstrated very efficient and selective 
ClHCO3 antiport across cell membranes.20 
The increase in transport efficiency conveyed through scaffold fluorination also increases transporter lipophilicity. Both 
lipophilicity and solubility are important aspects of transporter design; anion transporters with an optimal lipophilic balance are 
capable of efficiently permeating and traversing the lipid bilayer.
