Description:
A chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of glioblastoma.

Text:
Gliomas represent 40 of all brain tumors, which makes them the
most common and deadly human primary brain tumors About half of all newly diagnosed
gliomas correspond to glioblastoma (GBM), which is the most malignant type of brain cancer
(grade IV) with a median overall survival of approximately 14 17 months in current clinical
trials2 3 and around 12 months in populationbased studies.1 3 4 Because of the heterogeneous
nature of GBM, its treatment includes maximally safe surgical resection with subsequently
parallel chemotherapy (Temozolomide) and fractionated radiotherapy.5 Consistently low tumor
oxygenation (1 O2), also known as chronic hypoxia, is the main concern for GBM patients
since it promotes cancer cells spreading into healthy brain tissues to evade the adverse hypoxic
microenvironment.6 Although resection can achieve a reduction of the primary tumor burden, the
observation that more than 80 of the recurrences are situated adjacent to the resection cavity
suggests some utility for therapeutic platforms targeting this region.7 Previously, it has been
shown that due to the weakly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes that do not release factors vital
for the brainblood barrier (BBB) function, leaky interendothelial tight junctions exist in human
glioma.
