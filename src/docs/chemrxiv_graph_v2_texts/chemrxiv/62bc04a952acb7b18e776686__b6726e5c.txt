Description:
Undergoes reduction on the electrode surface, facilitating SECM imaging.

Text:
When the probe was scanned over the location of biomarkers, the currents 
would increase due to the reduction of the FcMeOH on the electrode surface and thus, 
generating an SECM image according to the current recorded at different locations on 
the sample surface.28 Afterward, the electrochemical images were merged with optical 
microscopic images to enhance the quality of the SECM images. The merged images 
have clear tissue boundaries and provide information on the distribution of cancer 
biomarkers in oral cancer from different human body. However, by changing the parameters of the image fusion process, thousands of 
fused images were generated, which was confusing and annoying to the researchers.
