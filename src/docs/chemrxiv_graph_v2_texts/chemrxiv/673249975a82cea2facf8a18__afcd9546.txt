Description:
Salts that require a substantial time and material investment to synthesize.

Text:
For instance, cyclic dia
rylhalonium salts specifically deliver biarylderived arynes 
and therefore lack broad generality.9,10,19,23 Additionally, 
triaryloxonium salts require a substantial time and materi
al investment to synthesize similar to that of o
trimethylsilylaryl 
triflates.13 
Unsymmetrical 
ar
yl(Mes)iodonium and aryl thianthrenium salts are unique
ly positioned within this class of aryne precursors to effect 
both mild and efficient access to arynes (Scheme 1b). Simple arenes are unconventional aryne precursors be
cause they lack complimentary electrofugal and nucleo
fugal leaving groups for a redox neutral elimination event. Yet, the dehydrogenation of simple arenes represents an 
expansive source of latent aryne intermediates and even 
has the potential for latestage functionalization of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients and agrochemicals.
