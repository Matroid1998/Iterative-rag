Description:
Used in transparent conductive films produced by sputtering.

Text:
Most of the
research on ZnO materials done by sputtering concerns trans
parent conductive ZnObased films (8, 22). In this technique,
a substrate is positioned close to the deposition source, where
it catches the arriving particles and enables them to coalesce
into a layer. Because the procedure takes place in a vacuum
deposition chamber, the particles can move about freely. The
coatings produced this way are in most cases textured along
the substratesource line of sight, and are not conforming be
cause the particles have a tendency to travel in straight lines. Magnetron sputtering can be used to deposit metals, alloys,
and composites on a variety of materials with thickness in the
nanometer and micrometer range.

Description:
Nanostructures can be obtained through magnetron sputtering with postdeposition annealing.

Text:
Compared to other vacuum
coating processes, it has a number of significant advantages
shown in figure 1. These properties have led to the develop
ment of many commercial applications, from the production
of microelectronics to simple decorative coatings. (23, 24)
Several years ago, our group showed it was surprisingly pos
sible to obtain ZnO nanostructures through magnetron sput
tering with postdeposition annealing (21) which opened the
way for uniform nanostructural ZnO coatings on large sur
faces. Their applicability in surface reactionbased applica
tions will be shown here as electrodes for photocatalytic wa
ter purifying. Although ZnO can decompose in strongly ba
sic or acidic environments, its low toxicity and availability
