The electronic structure of lanthanides gives place to energy ladders featuring long lived excited 
states that originate sharp 4f4f emission bands spanning a large range of wavelengths (from the 
NIR to the UV and visible region).12 This engenders photoluminescence properties that find 
applications in a wide variety of fields. The latter include medical imaging and bioassays,3 solar 
energy harvesting,46 data transmission and telecommunications,7 or light emitting devices.8 These 
Laporte forbidden intraconfigurational 4f4f transitions exhibit long radiative emission lifetimes as 
well as reduced absorption coefficients, restricting the access to the emitting excited states via 
direct light absorption.
