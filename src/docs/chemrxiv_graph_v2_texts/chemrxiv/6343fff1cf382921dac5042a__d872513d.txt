Description:
A tetrapyrrolic macrocycle with a 3D architecture and exceptional anion receptor properties.

In contrast, 
the tetrapyrrolic macrocycle calix4pyrrole, which is characterized by a lack of global conjugation, exhibits 
a 3D architecture with several preferred conformations depending on the chemical environment. This 
macrocycle11, which was discovered over 100 years ago, has been reported to exhibit exceptional anion
receptor properties12,13, significantly expanding its potential applications in the context of hostguest 
chemistry1417. Additionally, a calixtype 3D N4 macrocycle that features four pyridyl nitrogen atoms, 
calix4pyridine, has been reported as a neutral ligand for metal cations18, and the chemistry of its aza
