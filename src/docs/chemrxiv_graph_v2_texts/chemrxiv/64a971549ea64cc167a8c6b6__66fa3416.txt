Description:
Emerging 3D structures reinforce minimal steric effects from OH to F replacement.

Text:
The nearest equivalent for carbohydrates is the controlled replacement of 
individual OHgroups with hydrogen or fluorine to reveal which OHgroups are important for binding.10, 11 
Whereas simple deoxygenation is almost always detrimental to binding, deoxyfluorination (OH to F) can 
potentially provide a more diverse range of effects (Figure 1b)12 as fluorine is a hydrogenbond acceptor 
surrogate.13, 14 Furthermore, fluorination enhances CHp interactions involving adjacent CH bonds,1517 
modifies lipophilicity,1820 and can facilitate attractive multipolar interactions.2123 OH to F replacement has 
a minimal steric effect and does not significantly alter monosaccharide conformation, reinforced by 
emerging glycan 3D structures.24, 25 Fluorination can also lead to unfavourable interaction effects, such as 
loss of hydrogen bonding, or mismatched dipoles or partial charges.

Description:
A component used in glycan microarray synthesis.

Text:
It is the trisaccharide capping sequence of developmentally regulated stage
specific embryonic antigen, SSEA1,27 and the L5 antigen involved in early neural development28 The Lewisx 
motif is also expressed on tumour cells29, 30 and present among human milk oligosaccharides31 and where 
it has been shown to protect against toxins and pathogens involved in childhood diseases.32 Lewisx is also 
expressed on the surface of pathogens such as gastric cancer causing Helicobacter pylori,33 and 
Schistosoma mansoni,34 the causative agent of the life threatening parasitic disease schistosomiasis, 
affecting over 200 million people worldwide
