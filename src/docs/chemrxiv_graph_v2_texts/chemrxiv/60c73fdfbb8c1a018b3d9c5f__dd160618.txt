ther, the optimal composition may vary with the size of
the nanoparticle. Therefore, the accurate description of
chemical ordering is important; where, for certain mo
tifs, the ordering is very complex.28 Focus is placed on
expediting a fast unbiased homotop search by reducing
the number of energy evaluations needed to explore the
PES and locate the putative global minimum (GM) for
a given template structure. II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The chemical ordering of atoms is optimized for a 147
atom Mackay icosahedral template structure.29 Searches
