Description:
Undergoes functionalization after CH cyanation of allyl amines.

Text:
One common thread in all 
these methods is that they rely on free radical intermedi
ates (Scheme 1AB), which inherently limits their func
tional group tolerance. In an interesting extension of this 
principle, allyl amines can undergo CH cyanation in the 
presence of tBuOOHFeCl2 (typical conditions that allow 
CH cyanation), but then subsequently undergo func
tionalization at the olefin.26
