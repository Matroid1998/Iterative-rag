Description:
Can be isolated on a large scale with ease.

Some of the larger homologues of H4TBC4 are highly desirable for exploring polynuclear cluster formation, 
an example being H9TBC9 which has been seen to adopt a triplecone conformation akin to a three leaf 
clover in the solid state upon complexation to lanthanide ions.4 This molecule would be very interesting for 
synthesising highly symmetric polyhedra of 3d  4f ions but, as is the case for many of the very large 
homologues, it is (to our knowledge) only accessible in relatively small amounts via laborious synthetic and 
purification protocols. This therefore hinders the potential utility of the larger HnTBCns in the synthesis of 
coordination clusters, with the exception of H8TBC8 which can be isolated on a large scale with ease.
