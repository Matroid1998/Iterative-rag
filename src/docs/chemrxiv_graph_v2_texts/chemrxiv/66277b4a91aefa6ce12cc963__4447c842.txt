Description:
A molecule involved in transformation by hydrogenase enzymes for biofuel production.

Text:
The
hydrogenase
family
of
enzymes
are
key
for H2 transformation in many
microorganisms and they have recently attracted attention due to their ability to act as efficient
catalysts to oxidize hydrogen and produce biofuel (H2 2 H  2 e) or even act as part of
lightdriven production pipelines of H2 through water splitting16. However, some of the
members of this family of enzymes are inhibited or irreversibly damaged and destroyed by gas
molecules present in the environment, such as O2 and CO710. Therefore, efforts have been made
to develop strategies to rectify this problem and achieve inhibitortolerant enzymes1122. One
possible strategy to achieve inhibitortolerant enzymes can be blocking the access of these
inhibitors to the catalytic site by designing mutant forms through tunnel engineering16,2330.

Description:
A gas molecule whose diffusion was quantified inside NiFe hydrogenase.

Text:
This is evidence that tunnel engineering is a feasible
strategy to achieve CO and O2 tolerant hydrogenases33. Leroux et al. introduced protein film voltammetry, an experimental method that enabled
the study of kinetics of binding and release of CO and other gas molecules from NiFe
hydrogenases in a quantitative manner29. Using this technique, they quantified the diffusion of
CO, H2 and O2 inside the NiFe hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (Figure 1A)34. In the work of Liebgott et al, point mutations in this NiFe hydrogenase were introduced with
the goal of understanding how changes in the structure of the tunnels can modulate the diffusion
of gas molecules14,34. They created 10 different mutants, with mutations at positions V74 andor
L122 of the large subunit (Figure 1B).
