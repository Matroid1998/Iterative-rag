Description:
Used as an iron precursor in CVD processes.

The chemical 
process from precursor to thin film always involves surface reactions and often also gas phase 
reactions.2 CVD processes of elemental electropositive metals, such as Al, Fe, and Ti, typically 
requires high deposition temperatures to overcome the thermodynamical barrier associated with 
reducing them from a positive valance in the precursor molecule to a zero valent state in the 
film.3 An alternative to high thermal energy is to supply the energy partly by a plasma discharge, 
utilizing free electrons, ions, photons, radicals and excited species to enable alternative 
reactions paths.4 
We have recently presented a CVD process where we used the metallocenes ferrocene, FeCp2, 
cobaltocene, CoCp2, and nickelocene, NiCp2, as iron, cobalt, and nickel precursors, 
respectively, and utilized the free electrons in an argon (Ar) plasma as reducing agents to deposit 
iron, cobalt, and nickel films without external heating.5 We refer to the process as electron CVD 
(eCVD).
