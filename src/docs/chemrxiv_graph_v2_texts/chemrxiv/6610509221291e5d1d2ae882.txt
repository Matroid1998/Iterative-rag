Text:
Sulfur has been recognised as one of the earliest known elements for its therapeutic properties 
by the ancient Greeks.1 It is one of the essential components for all living organisms, occurring in the 
amino acids, methionine and cysteine, and in the vitamins, thiamine and biotin, amongst others.12 
Approximately, 250 FDA drugs bearing sulfurcontaining functional groups were approved, including 
for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bacterial infections, migraine, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
neurological disorders, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Figure 1).1234

Description:
Exists in multiple oxidation forms, predominantly in the 6 valence state as sulfate in the earth's atmosphere.

Text:
Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in nature, accounting about 0.03 to 0.06 of the 
earths crust by weight.1 The sulfur atom exists in multiple oxidation forms, ranging from 2 to 6. Sulfur is present predominantly in the 6valance state as the sulfate form in the earth atmosphere. Sulfur trioxide (SO3) is a key precursor to sulfate and present in oleum, a solution of sulfur 
trioxide 2565  in sulfuric acid (H2SO4).5 Moreover, sulfur trioxide is a strong Lewis acid, engages in 
reactions with Lewis bases such as trimethylamine (Me3N), triethylamine (Et3N), dioxane, and pyridine 
(Py). These reactions result in the formation of sulfur trioxide adducts, which are be used in the 
sulfation process of various organic substrates, leading to the formation of organosulfate esters (Figure 
2).6
