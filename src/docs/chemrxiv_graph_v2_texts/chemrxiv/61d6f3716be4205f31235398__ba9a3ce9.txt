Description:
A rare earth intermetallic magnet known for its strong permanent magnetic properties.

Text:
Rareearth intermetallic magnets  samariumcobalt (SmCo)1 and neodymium (NdFeB)2, 3  are the 
strongest permanent magnets known to date with multiple applications in modern technology ranging 
from hard disk drives to electric vehicles and wind turbines.4 Their commercial success results from the 
combination of the strong magnetic anisotropy of rare earths and their direct magnetic coupling with 
transition metal ions. At the other far end of the current search for novel magnetic materials are magnetic 
molecules, called molecular nanomagnets5 (MNMs) or single molecule magnets (SMMs).
