Description:
A compound whose substituents can significantly affect potential energy surfaces.

1321 Strong substituent
eects for substituted pyridine have been demonstrated
by Halcrow and colleagues. 16 Carefully selected substituents
can be powerful aids for redesigning the potential energy
surfaces (PESs) and thereby optimizing functionality. We
capitalized on this in our previous study where we applied
substitution to the tridentate terpyridine ligand in the 4
position to systematically modify the quintet lifetime of
their homoleptic Fe(II) complexes by changing the relevant
energy barriers. 22 We theoretically examined how the po
tential energy surfaces, and in consequence the lifetime of
the excited quintet state of Fe(terpy)22(terpy  2,26,2
terpyridine) can be modied upon substitution with electron
donating (ED) or withdrawing (EW) groups on the central
pyridine (Py) ring in the 4 () position (Scheme 1).
