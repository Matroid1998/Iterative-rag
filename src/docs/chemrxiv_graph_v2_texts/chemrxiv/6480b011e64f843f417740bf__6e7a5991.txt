Description:
Redox-active molecules used in electrochemical systems for CO2 capture.

Text:
A range of electrochemical carbon dioxide capture 
systems have been reported, including those based on electrochemically driven pH swings,8 
capacitive systems,9,10 and systems that employ redoxactive molecules such as quinones, 
both in protic and aprotic electrolytes.1115 Using redoxactive quinone molecules is one of the 
largest areas of research for new technologies due to their highly reversible redoxactivity and 
stoichiometric capture of CO2 upon reduction.

Description:
Redox-active molecules involved in electrochemically driven carboxylation.

Text:
Electrochemically driven carboxylation of reduced quinones has been well documented.16,17 
While neutral anthraquinone does not show carbon dioxide binding, electrochemical reduction 
to form a radical anion (1 electron reduction) or dianion (2 electron reduction) activates this 
molecule to bind CO2 in either an EECC or ECEC (E  electron transfer, C  chemical reaction) 
mechanism (Scheme 1).18 While most early studies used analytical electrochemistry 
techniques to study the carbon dioxide capture of quinones and other redoxactive 
molecules,19,20 more recent work has begun to develop practical devices that can capture 
carbon dioxide in an electrochemically driven process.21
