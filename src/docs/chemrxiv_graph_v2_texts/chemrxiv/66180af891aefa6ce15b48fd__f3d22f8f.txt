Description:
Gold-containing salts used in the bottom-up synthesis of stable NHCAuNPs.

In this 
context, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), being biocompatible and featuring distinct (photo) physical properties, are one of the most 
common motifs.1 Stateoftheart AuNP systems decorated with selective targeting vectors allow highprecision detection of bio
molecules but often lack straightforward preparation and longterm stability in complex analytes.2 To improve stability in biological 
media and simplify target vector installation, robust and versatile postsynthetically modifiable AuNP platforms are desired.3 
Nitrogen (N) heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been found to be excellent persistent surface ligands for metallic NPs, forming strong 
and inert bonds to the NP surfaces.4 Furthermore, the synthetic versatility of NHC precursors facilitates the synthesis of highly stable 
and multifunctional NHCAuNPs.5 The synthesis of such stable NHCAuNPs can be achieved by two major pathways 1) bottom
up (BU) by the reduction of NHCAu complexes or goldcontaining imidazolium (IMZ) salts6 and 2) topdown (TD) via the exchange of 
weaklycoordinated ligands with activated NHCs or the deposition of NHCAu complexes.7 The bottomup approach benefits from a 
single reduction step but often lacks precise control over the final size of the resulting AuNPs.
