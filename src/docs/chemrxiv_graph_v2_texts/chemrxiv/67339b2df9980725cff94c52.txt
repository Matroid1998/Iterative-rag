In 
this work, we describe our contribution to solve automatic structure elucidation by proposing a flexible 
model that can translate spectroscopic data directly into molecules, while addressing several 
limitations of current ComputerAssisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) programs. CASE programs use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) andor Infrared (IR) data to elucidate 
molecular structures. H and 13C NMR are the most widely used spectroscopic techniques for 
characterizing molecules and provide detailed insights into hydrogen and carbon atoms. Furthermore, 
2D techniques such as COSY (Correlation Spectroscopy) and HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum 
Coherence) provide connectivity information.1 Mass spectrometry (MS) offers molecular weight and 
formula information, crucial for confirming molecular structures.1 IR spectroscopy is costeffective and 
nondestructive allowing for quick identification of functional groups.
