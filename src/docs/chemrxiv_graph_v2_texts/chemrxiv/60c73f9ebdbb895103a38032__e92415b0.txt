Description:
Referenced in the context of the GAFF force field.

Text:
32) force eld for the canonical amino acids and
the GAFF force eld for methane, ethane and propane. For the
remaining amino acids and for the uorinated small molecules,
we used a force eld developed by us (previous own work33
and SI sections 1 and 2) based on AMBER14 (amino acids) or
GAFF (small molecules). The main difference between our force
eld for uorinated molecules and GAFFAMBER14 lies in the
LennardJones (LJ) parameters of uorine, and of hydrogen (HF)
bonded to a uorinated carbon.
