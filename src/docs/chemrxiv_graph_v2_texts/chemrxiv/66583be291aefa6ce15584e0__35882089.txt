Description:
A nonnatural analogue of phospholipids lost through chemical evolution.

Text:
Phospholipids are major constituents of biological mem
branes.1 Their emergence on early Earth would thus have 
marked a pivotal step on the path towards primitive cells.2 
Prebiotic synthesis would have produced heterogeneous mix
tures of isomeric phospholipids. Yet, only natural phospholip
ids comprising glycerol1phosphate (G1P) and glycerol3
phosphate (G3P) were retained in biological membranes, 
while nonnatural analogues comprising glycerol2phosphate 
(G2P) were lost through chemical evolution. However, it is 
not clear how natural phospholipids were selected. Prebiotic chemists have sought to identify mechanisms by 
which the natural building blocks of life could have been se
lected. However, investigations have focused almost exclu
sively on nucleosides and peptides.
