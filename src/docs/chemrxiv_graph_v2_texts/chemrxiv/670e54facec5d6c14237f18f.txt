Description:
A SW-like moiety associated with nanographenes, influencing their spintronic and optoelectronic properties.

Text:
of StoneWales (SW) and SWlike (azulene) moieties, on their alternant isomers, 
we set here to examine the roots, and profound characteristics of such nanographenes (NGRs) to 
systematically optimize and functionalize their spintronic and optoelectronic properties. Setting 
aside for the moment (longitudinal) quantum confinement, which can be taken care by longer 
NGRs, we find that the deeper reason for these properties is either decreasing antiaromaticity or 
increasing aromaticity, the two not always been equivalent. Although decreasing antiaromaticity 
determines the spin state for a given geometry, increasing aromaticity is the decisive factor for 
selecting the ground state geometry. Yet, it is not necessarily associated with larger negative 
values of nucleusindependent chemical shifts (NICS). Actually, higher aromaticity maybe 
accompanied by highly antiaromatic rings with positive NICS numbers.
