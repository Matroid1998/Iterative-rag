Description:
A widely used dopant for Pt catalysts to improve selectivity.

Text:
The interaction between metal and coke influencing selectivity is reminiscent of dopants or
promoters; the selectivity improvement from adding Sn or Ge to the Pt catalyst comes at the
cost of activity, though not to the same extent as coking. Sn is the most widelyused dopant
for Pt, though Ge has been found to produce similar improvements in stability against cok
