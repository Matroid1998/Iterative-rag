Description:
A transition metal frequently used in chemical synthesis.

To comply with governments regulations (e.g., USP 232 in the United States),1 the pharmaceutical industry 
must ensure that heavy metals are below their toxic levels in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Among 
heavy metals, palladium is the most frequently used transition metal in chemical synthesis2 and must be below 10 
ppm in APIs, according to USP 232. Therefore, process chemists must develop a specific and highly efficient 
palladiumscavenging protocol for each API to meet the safety regulation. This is accomplished through screenings 
of dozens of potential workup protocols and scavengers, among other purification techniques.310 This process 
generates several dozens of samples in which to quantify palladium. Meanwhile, new scavengers continue to 
emerge,7, 11, 12 adding options to explore.

Description:
A trace metal analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).

Trace metal analysis has been performed using inductivelycoupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS).13
17 Unfortunately, ICPMS is a highly specialized, costly method for analyzing palladium. The instrument is large 
and expensive, requires highly skilled experimentalists, a long calibration time upon starting, and expensive 
materials to maintain operation. Additionally, ICPMS often becomes the bottle neck of the entire API purification 
process because scavenger screenings are high throughput while ICPMS is low throughput, thus slowing the 
process.
