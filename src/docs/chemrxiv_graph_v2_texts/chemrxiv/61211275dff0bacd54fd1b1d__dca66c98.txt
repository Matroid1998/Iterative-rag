Furthermore, the photocatalytic properties of GQDs are enhanced upon coordination of a metal 
catalyst, such as cobaloximes for hydrogen evolution chemistry.11 Unlike GQDs, application of 
GNRs remains relatively unexplored, yet these compounds show great potential in photocatalysis 
since their absorption profiles cover much of the visible light region, making them efficient solar 
light absorbers. In addition to their excellent light harvesting, GNRs exhibit high charge carrier 
mobilities12 which are expected to enable efficient delivery of charge carriers to the oxidation 
and reduction catalytic sites for photocatalysis. Recent developments in bottomup nanocarbon synthesis methods have enabled the preparation 
of welldefined nanocarbons with tunable size, shape, and functional groups.13,14 These methods 
often start with the synthesis of soluble polyphenylene precursors using DielsAlder 
additiondecarbonylation,15 SuzukiMiyaura16, or Yamamoto17 coupling reactions.
