Description:
Relatively abundant and used in batteries as an alternative to lithium.

Text:
One of the most promising alternatives to lithium batteries are sodium batteries 4
which, unlike lithium, do not suer from scarcity issues due to sodiums relative abundance. Based on sodiums chemically similar behavior to lithium, many concepts developed through
the study of lithium batteries can be applied to sodium batteries .5,6
One such aspect lies in understanding the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Although there are dierences due to dierent kinds of anode materials used between lithium
