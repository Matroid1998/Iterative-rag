Description:
Radicals used in radical trifluoromethylation for constructing alkylCF3 bonds.

Text:
While 
the construction of C(sp2)CF3 bonds has been extensively investigated, the introduction of 
alkyl trifluoromethyl groups has lagged by comparison.36 In the past few decades, with the 
advancement of fundamental radical chemistry and the development of diverse 
trifluoromethylation reagents, radical trifluoromethylation has injected new vitality into the 
efficient construction of alkylCF3 bonds.78 In general, two types of radicalmediated 
trifluoromethylation have been reported, including the welldeveloped addition of CF3 radicals
