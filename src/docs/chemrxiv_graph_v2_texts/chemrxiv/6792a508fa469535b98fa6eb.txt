Description:
Responsible for approximately 8% of anthropogenic emissions.

With an annual production exceeding 5000 Mt and a projected
demand that continues to rise steadily, cement stands out as the
most extensively manufactured material on the planet1. Cement
based materials alone represent over 30 of the global mate
rial production output and are responsible for emitting approx
imately 8 of anthropogenic CO2 emissions1. The pressing need
to develop cement with reduced carbon footprint is coupled with
the increasing utilization of supplementary cementitious materi
als (SCMs)2. However, the use of SCMs results in lower initial re
activity and therefore lower early age compressive strength. This
limitation serves as a compelling impetus for more foundational
research in the area of cement hydration.
