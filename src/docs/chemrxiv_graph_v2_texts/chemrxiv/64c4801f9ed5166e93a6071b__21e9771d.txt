Description:
High release is hypothesized to cause excitotoxicity leading to neurodegeneration.

Text:
High glutamate release, NMDA 
activation, and resulting excitotoxicity are hypothesized to be 
one of the significant causes of neurodegeneration in disorders 
such as Alzheimers disease (AD)2 (reviewed in Parameshwaran 
et al.3). One of the hallmarks of AD is the aggregation of amyloidb into 
senile plaques. Studies have indicated that Cu(II) is among the 
primary cations found inside senile plaques4. Interestingly, 
some studies suggest that Cu(II) binding to amyloidb makes it 
more prone to aggregation and increases the production of 
reactive oxygen species5, 6, thereby leading to cognitive decline 
and neurodegeneration. It has even been suggested that 
amyloidb is increased to combat toxic levels of metal ions such 
as Cu(II)710.
