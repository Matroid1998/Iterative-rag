Description:
Has exceptionally high OER activity proposed to originate through Sr2 leaching and surface amorphization.

Finally, the evolution of lattice oxygen 
modifies the ligand coordination of surface transition metal ions, becoming an additional factor in 
the degradation of a perovskite.2123 For clarity, we define leaching as an ion deinsertion process 
that preserves the structural motif of an oxide (i.e., a topochemical reaction involving vacancies), 
while dissolution is a complete structural disintegration of the surface layer through the solvation 
of the transition metal ions. Strontium iridate (SrIrO3) has recently attracted attention owing to its exceptionally high 
OER activity proposed to originate through Sr2 leaching and surface amorphization.3,7,8,10,2428 
Assuming that Sr2 leaching involves electrochemical deinsertion (Path 1 as opposed to Path 2 in 
Equations S1), electrochemical leaching of Sr2 from SrIrO3 involves two holes (h).
