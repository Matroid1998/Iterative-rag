Soft materials such as hydrogels and elastomers have become indispensable in diverse modern 
technologies, including stretchable electronics, biomedical devices, microfluidics, drug 
delivery, soft robotics and so on, owing to their exceptional properties like softness, 
stretchability, ease of handling, and biocompatibility 12. However, hydrogels and silicones 
exhibit contrasting characteristics, for example, hydrogel is hydrophilic, whereas silicone is 
hydrophobic and mechanically stronger, for which they are utilized separately in different 
applications. So, their integration into a single material allows the potential to synergistically 
combine their dissimilar features in one heterogeneous material with enhanced 
functionalities345. For example, polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel which is a tough, 
flexible and transparent hydrogel, is synthesized by crosslinking the acrylamide monomer in 
electrolyte solutions such as KCl, NaCl and LiCl to make ionic conductors6.
