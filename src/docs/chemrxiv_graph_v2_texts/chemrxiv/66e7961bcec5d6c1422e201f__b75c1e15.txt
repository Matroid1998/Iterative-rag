Under humid or aqueous conditions, interfacial water molecules are ubiquitous in nature and 
33 
technology. The solidliquid interface is vital in countless physical, chemical, or biological 
34 
processes and applications14. One important factor to understand the structural properties 
35 
of interfacial water is the hydrogen bond network at the interface, which is notoriously 
36 
difficult to probe1,3. Recent studies revealed an exciting way to study the interfacial hydrogen 
37 
network within MOFs5,6 and graphene capillaries7 via atmospheric water capture (AWC)810. 38 
It is now appealing to further broaden the use of this methodology. Firstly, extend AWC 
39 
beyond the specific case of MOFs or the perfect graphene plane as the solid adsorbent. These 
40 
materials consider special cases which have few technological and natural analogues.

Description:
A representative of functionalised carbon.

Text:
Here, we solve this issue by utilising functionalised 
50 
graphene (graphene oxide) as a representative of functionalised carbon. Graphene oxide (GO) 
51 
can be readily intercalated with cations which allows probing the interfacial hydrogen 
52 
network of functionalised carbon under the presence of cations via AWC. 53 
Graphene oxide is composed of a graphene plane along with various oxygen functionalities22
54 
26. The presence of functionalised areas gives rise to stable dipole sites and development of a 
55 
hydrogen bond network with water molecules15,16. Water transport via GO based materials 
56 
has been widely studied in experiments and simulations to better understand its surface 
57 
interaction with water molecules2734. Yet, direct experimental evidence is still limited for 
58 
progressive understanding of the hydrogenbond network on the GO surface.
