Description:
A compound whose Na vacancy concentration is affected by n and p-type aliovalent doping, influencing ion diffusion.

of smaller and
lighter V, and stiffer VS bonds. Softer SbS sublattice is more polarizable, which reduces the
interaction between the SbS framework and migrating Na ions and thereby, boosts ion.27
In summary, we use firstprinciples defect calculations to quantify the increasedecrease
in Na vacancy concentration due to n and ptype aliovalent doping of Na3SbS4. In addition
to changing the concentration of defects that mediate ion diffusion, doping also affects the ion
