United Utilities identified two major water treatment plants at the outset of the third Asset 
Management Plan (AMP3) investment period, these being Oswestry and Watchgate WTWs, that were 
in need of major investment to meet tightening water quality standards for trihalomethanes (THMs) 
and Cryptosporidium. The two works are at the head of extensive treated water aqueduct systems, 
namely the Haweswater and Vyrnwy Aqueduct systems. These aqueducts transport water to two large 
urban conurbations, Liverpool and Manchester, from treatment plants that are approximately 100 km 
from the start of the distribution network. As with most large cities the network system is both 
extensive and complex with a number of service reservoirs and points of secondary chlorination.
