Description:
Used as an effective drug delivery system in polymeric microspheres for controlled release.

Text:
Microencapsulation has been explored as a promising method for controlled drug re
lease.13 Polymeric microspheres, for example polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA)
and poly(D,Llactidecoglycolide) (PLGA), can be used as eective drug delivery systems
protecting the encapsulated active agent and controlling the release rate over periods of hours
to months.1,4 By applying the correct methodology when preparing microspheres, challenges
such as targeting the drug to a specic organ or tissue, and precisely controlling the rate of
drug delivery to the target site can be addressed.3,5 The technique of double waterinoil
inwater (wow) emulsion has been widely used for the encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs
as this preparative method minimises the loss of drug activity via contact with the organic
solvent.2,6 The basis of this methodology is to emulsify an aqueous solution of the active
compound in an organic solution of the hydrophobic coating polymer.
