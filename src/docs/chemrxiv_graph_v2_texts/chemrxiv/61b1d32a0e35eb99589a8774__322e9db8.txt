Description:
Molecules that target DNA gyrase by intercalating into DNA breaks and binding specific gyrA residues.

Text:
The fluoroquinolones target the DNA gyrase (DNAG), a tetrameric enzyme which unwinds DNA 
by forming and religating double stranded DNA breaks prior to transcription and replication (Fig. 1b). Specifically, two fluoroquinolone molecules intercalate into DNA breaks and bind specific 
gyrA residues via a coordinated Mg2 ion. This stabilizes DNADNA gyrase covalent linkages and 
prevents religation of DNA double stranded breaks.
