Description:
A form of diorganostannanes involved in transition metal catalyzed dehydropolymerization.

Text:
Polystannanes are main group polymers with a conjugated backbone of tin atoms prepared from the reductive coupling 
of dihalido or dihydrido diorganostannane monomers.1,2 Sodium (Wurtz)35 or electrochemical coupling6,7 of X2SnRR 
leads directly to the desired materials, while conversion of such materials to diorganostannanes, H2SnRR followed by 
transition metal catalyzed dehydropolymerization810 affords the target polystannanes. Key to both approaches is 
access to both homo and heterodiorganostannanes.
