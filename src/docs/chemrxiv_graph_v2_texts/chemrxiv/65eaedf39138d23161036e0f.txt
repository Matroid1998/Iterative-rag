Description:
A component of natural deep eutectic solvents used in biomass treatment.

Text:
Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are intricate mixtures
typically composed of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD)
and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), exhibiting a
notable reduction in melting temperature at specic
compositions compared to their individual constituents. DES are recognized for their ease of synthesis and envi
ronmentally friendly origins, as underscored by Hansen
et al. 1. This study is driven by the compelling applications
demonstrated by a specic DES, the combination of

cholinechloride (ChCl) and lactic acid (LA) (see Fig
ure 1), in biomass treatment. Belonging to the class
of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), ChClLA
oers promise as a green solvent due to its derivation
from readily available natural compounds 2.
