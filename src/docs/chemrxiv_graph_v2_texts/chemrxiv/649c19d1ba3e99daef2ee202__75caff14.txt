Description:
Used in lithium ion batteries, which have safety concerns related to their electrolytes based on organic carbonates.

Text:
The limited safety of the present day lithium ion battery (LIB) technology represents the 
major drawbacks of commercially available LIBs. Current commercial LIBs use electrolytes 
based on organic carbonates which pose serious safety concerns and strongly reduce the 
battery operative temperature range 1,2. For these reasons, there has been considerable 
research interest to either partially andor totally replace the organic solvents (in the 
electrolytes) with a new type of fluid materials, acting as poorly flammable andor flame 
retardant components, called ionic liquids (ILs) 3,4. ILs instead of organic carbonates, 
appear to be promising electrolytes for LIBs because they generally have negligible vapour 
pressure, high chemical and thermal stability 57.
