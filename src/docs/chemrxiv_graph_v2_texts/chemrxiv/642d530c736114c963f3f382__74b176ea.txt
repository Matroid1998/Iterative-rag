Description:
A chemical element involved in fixation processes such as photosynthesis and geochemical weathering.

Thus, this decade is a decisive period to test and develop CDR options
that will eventually deliver the negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions required for climate
stability. Broadly, CDR solutions can be grouped into three categories. There are varying naming
conventions for these three groups within the CDR community and a consensus has not yet
emerged on how to best label them. For the purposes of this paper, we refer to biogenic, geo
chemical and novel CDR. Biogenic CDR entails harnessing natural carbon fixation processes
through living organisms, such as photosynthesis. Geochemical CDR harnesses carbon fixa
tion processes that occur and are geochemical in nature, such as weathering, mineralization,
and the transfer of carbon between the air and ocean.
