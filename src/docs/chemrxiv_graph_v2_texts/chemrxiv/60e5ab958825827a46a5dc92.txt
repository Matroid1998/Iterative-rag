Description:
An atmospheric pollutant formed via the burning of fossil fuels and cigarette use.

In recent years, there has been signicant experimental research progress on substituted iso
cyanate molecules including substituents such as, CN,1 ClSO2,2 CCH,3,4 CH3,5,6 Ph,7,8
CH2CH2Cl,9 tBu,10 and many more1114 Isocyanic acid (HNCO) is the lowest energy iso
mer of the HNCO system and the simplest isocyanate,15,16 an important class of molecules for
many diverse chemical contexts. HNCO is an atmospheric pollutant formed via the burning
of fossil fuels, cigarette use, and other secondary sources.1721 Many combustion processes
are also related to the HNCO species and its derivatives.7,2224 Isocyanate molecules are also
important interstellar species46,25 that are implicated as critical intermediates for prebiotic
precursors such as formamide,2628 thyamine,29 and urea.30 One of the reasons isocyanates
are so ubiquitous is their diverse and facile reactivity with many organic molecules,11,17,3133,33
