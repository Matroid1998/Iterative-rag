Description:
Used as an alkaline electrolyte that hinders hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and facilitates ECH reactions.

(31) A notable example is the ECH of acetonitrile, where 
a FE of 8090 was achieved at 100500 mA cm2 in 1 M aqueous NaOH, in contrast to the 
dominant HER under acidic or neutral conditions. (18) 
While hindering HER to the advantage of ECH reactions, the use of alkaline electrolytes poses 
important requirements due to the change in the sourcing hydrogen under these conditions ECH 
sources H atoms from protons present in the acidic electrolyte, whereas H atoms are mainly 
sourced through water dissociation on the electrode surface in alkaline solution (Fig 1B). (32) In 
addition, the adsorbed H atoms must exhibit a moderate binding strength at the operating applied 
potential in order to facilitate the ECH of the organic substrate, according to the Sabatiers 
principle.
