Description:
Used in rechargeable metal-air battery systems.

Text:
Metalair (O2) batteries, owing to their high theoretical energy densities in comparison to metal ion 
batteries, are emerging as potential plausible energy storage solutions. (1, 2) Out of different 
metals (Li, Zn, Al, Fe etc.) based rechargeable metalair battery systems, Zn based energy
