Description:
Formed from barbituric acids and activated olefins in electrocatalysis.

The same PCA was involved in studies of role of anion and cation in the 1methyl3
butyl imidazolium ionic liquids in the Knoevenagel condensation 15; in synthesis, characterization 
and heterogeneous base catalysis of amino functionalized lanthanide metalorganic frameworks 
16; in stereoselective cascade assembling of benzylidenecyanoacetates and 1,3dimethylbarbituric 
acid into (1R,2S)1cyano5,7dialkyl4,6,8trioxo2aryl5,7diazaspiro2.5octane1
carboxylates 17; in studies of the molecular diversity of threecomponent reactions of 4
dimethylamino or 4methoxypyridine with acetylenedicarboxylates and arylidene cyanoacetates 
18; in electrocatalysis in MIRC reactions related to facile stereoselective approach to medicinally 
relevant spirocyclopropylbarbiturates from barbituric acids and activated olefins 19.
