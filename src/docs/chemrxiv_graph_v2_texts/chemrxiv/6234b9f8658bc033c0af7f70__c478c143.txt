Description:
Catalysts widely used for direct and selective CH functionalization.

Selective CH functionalization plays an important role3 in the 
synthesis of bioactive natural products414, drug metabolism1516, 
pharmaceutical industry1723, DNA repair2427, and transcription28
30. CH bonds can be functionalized in various ways, including but 
not limited to cyanation3138, oxidation39, hydroxylation40, 
epoxidation4142, and halogenation4345. Activation of unreactive 
CH bonds typically requires harsh conditions46 due to the high 
CH bond dissociation energy15 and its inert nature47. While CH 
halogenation is widely used, CH fluorination is a difficult 
process, oftentimes requiring special safety equipment and highly 
reactive reagents4854. Despite the difficulties, several studies were 
carried out to understand CH fluorination since it might play a 
crucial role in drug development23, 5559. Transition metal catalysts are widely used for direct and selective 
CH functionalization60.
