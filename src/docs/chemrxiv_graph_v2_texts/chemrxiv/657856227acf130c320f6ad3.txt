Description:
Used to induce the transient gelation of aryl esters.

Text:
A first example by van Esch and coworkers explored a methyl iodide
driven reaction cycle which was used to induce the transient gelation of aryl esters.7 More recent studies 
focussed on other fuels including agents for acylation,8, 9methylation,1012 and oxidation,1317 as well as 
triphosphates,1820 sugars,21, 
22 decarboxylating acids2326 and carbodiimides2732. Especially, 
carbodiimidedriven reaction cycles, which rely on the transient formation of carboxylic anhydrides and 
esters attained popularity in nonenzymatic systems chemistry (Figure 1A).33 Despite drawbacks related 
to Nacyl rearrangements and the problematic accumulation of urea waste products (H bond donor and 
acceptor), carbodiimides are excellent fuels, because they exhibit only minor background hydrolysis and 
therefore allow efficient and reliable control of reaction cycle steady states.34 On this basis, impressive
