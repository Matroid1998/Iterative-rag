Description:
Elements that primarily form coordination bonds through electrostatic effects rather than orbital overlaps and covalent bonding.

Text:
The lanthanide elements function as crucial components for a wide range of technologies, 
including the magnets of wind turbines, LED lights, electric vehicle batteries, and catalytic 
agents.16 When dissolved in solution, it is uniquely challenging to characterize the structures of 
the lanthanide ions, as they primarily form coordination bonds through electrostatic effects rather 
than orbital overlaps and covalent bonding. These features lead to lanthanide ions often having 
large coordination numbers whose complexes can assemble in multiple lowenergy, nonrigid 
geometries.7 For several decades, a variety of experimental techniques810 have been developed 
to help elucidate what these ion structures are within solution, including Xray absorption 
spectroscopy (XAS).
