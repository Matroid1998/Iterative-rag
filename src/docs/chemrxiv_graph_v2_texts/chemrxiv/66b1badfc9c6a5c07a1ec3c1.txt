Antibiotic resistant bacteria are of great concern, especially when they are resistant to 
multiple or last resort antibiotics. The 2016 published ONeill report warns, that antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) related deaths will exceed those caused by cancer until 2050, unless this 
trend is slowed decisively 1, 2. A crucial step in overcoming AMR is the restricted use of 
antibiotics. For evaluation and monitoring the use of antibiotics, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) therefore published the access, watch, reserve (AWaRe) classification for 
antibiotics whose latest version from 2023 includes 261 antibiotics. The reserve group 
contains 29 different drugs or drug combinations, such as the cyclic lipopeptide daptomycin 
(DAP), whose application is considered as last resort 3.
