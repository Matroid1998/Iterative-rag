Description:
Used in ultra hard commercial coatings with high elastic modulus.

Text:
To
accomplish this, graft polymers bearing reactive epoxide
15groups
are
mixed
with
small
molecule
aminethiol
crosslinkers. Ultrasonic irradiation is used to apply high
strain rates to the shielded polymers. Straining of the graft
polymers overcomes their steric barrier to interaction with
the small molecule crosslinkers, facilitating a reaction,
that
rapidly
strengthens
the
material. The
resultant
materials achieve elastic modulus values comparable to
ultra hard commercial epoxy coatings. We anticipate that
these shielded polymers will be useful as extremely hard
and solventresistant coatings and as adhesives that can
be cured by focusing ultrasound through the surfaces the
adhesive is bound to. Materials and Methods
