Used in packed bed form in tubular flow reactors to influence product distribution.

Text:
Consequently, residence time 
distributions (RTD) in tubular flow reactors equipped with a 
packed bed of magnesium turnings will have an impact on 
product distribution. To minimize the contact between the 
halide educt and the Grignard reagent, a plugflow like 
behaviour is favourable, ideally having a constant velocity 
across the crosssection of the tube and no backmixing, 
resulting in a narrow residence time distribution. The residence 
time distributions of chemical reactors depend on the flow and 
mixing conditions and is a longknown tool of reactor 
development to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics of a 
reactor.

Some literature reviews do exist, dealing with 
the concept of oscillatory flow reactors (OFR) and giving an 
overview of the broad potential and applications of this specific 
reactor type.2732 Investigated solidcontaining reaction systems 
operated under oscillating flow conditions consider on the one 
hand solid particles being suspended in the fluid2224,26 and on 
the other hand being placed in packed beds.18,19,25,3335 
In the case of the flow tube reactor used in this publication, it is 
not a COBR type reactor, but a tubular reactor fitted with a 
packed bed of magnesium turnings. The magnesium turnings in 
the reactor cartridge present obstacles to the flow through the 
reactor, influencing flow behaviour, so the fluid usually does not 
flow through the reactor in a uniform way.
