Description:
Shows significant overlap in XANES spectra with Cu23 NC, indicating no notable changes in electronic states.

The Xray absorption 
nearedge structure (XANES) spectra at the Cu Kedge for 
both the pristine Cu23 NC and the loaded catalysts (Cu23CB) 
showed significant overlap, indicating no notable changes 
in their electronic states (Figure S10). Both samples 
displayed a peak 8992 eV, confirming the presence of a 
mixture of Cu(I) and Cu(0) species, as this peak lies between 
the characteristic energies of Cu(0) and Cu(I) species. Further insights were gained from the Fourier transform
extended Xray absorption fine structure (FTEXAFS) 
spectra at the Cu Kedge. The spectra revealed a similar 
geometric arrangement in both the pristine and loaded 
catalysts, with an identical peak observed at 1.8 , which 
is attributed to CuP or CuS bonding (Figure 4a).
