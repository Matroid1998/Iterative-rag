Description:
Undergoes cis-trans isomerization upon photoirradiation and is used in photomanipulation techniques.

Photoresponsive molecules are widely used in various fields, 
including materials chemistry and chemical biology. 1 Such 
molecules exhibit drastic changes in chemical structure or specific 
bond cleavages in response to external photostimulation. 2 For 
instance, azobenzene, which undergoes cistrans isomerization 
upon photoirradiation, is a representative photoresponsive 
chemical 
structure 
widely 
used 
in 
photomanipulation 
techniques.3 Other unique photoresponsive molecules, such as 
nitrobenzene and coumarinlinked derivatives, are known as 
photocleavable molecules, which exhibit specific bond cleavages 
triggered by photoirradiation.4 These photocleavable molecules 
are valuable tools, particularly in the fields of cell and chemical 
biology. For instance, caged compounds composed of 
photocleavable molecules can activate biologically inert signaling 
molecules via photostimulation.
