Carbon capture and storage from fossilbased power generation is a critical component of realistic 
strategies for preventing a further rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, capturing 
meaningful amounts of CO2 using current technology could result in a prohibitive rise in the cost 
of electric power consumed. One strategy to minimize energy consumption and economic 
penalties is to exploit industrial streams in which CO2 is already at high partial pressures, such as 
the syngas exiting coal gasifiers at integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants.
