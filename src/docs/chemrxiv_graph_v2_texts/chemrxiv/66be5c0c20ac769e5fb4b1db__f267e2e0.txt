Description:
Exhibits combinations of different types of distortion in its polymorphs, leading to a spectrum of molecular geometries.

Text:
The work presented 
here reveals that the gasphase structure and P6I are extreme 
cases, and that other polymorphs of cP6T6 exhibit 
combinations of both types of distortion, to give a spectrum of 
molecular geometries, as shown in Fig. 3b. During crystallization of samples of cP6T6, over a decade 
ago, besides the crystals that provided the published structure 
P6I, it was reported that a second polymorph with hexagonal 
symmetry was persistently observed.6 The structure of this 
other polymorph could not be determined because the lack of 
longrange order in one direction resulted in essentially no 
diffraction at certain orientations of the crystal. However, the 
data collected at that time were sufficient to determine unit cell 
dimensions (a, b  49.85 , c  29.46  a  b  90, g  120).
