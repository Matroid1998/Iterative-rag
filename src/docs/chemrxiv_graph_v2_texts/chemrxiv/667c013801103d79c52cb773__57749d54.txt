Description:
Thermodynamically unstable in cubic form below 843 K.

Text:
At higher temperatures they decompose into an 
equilibrium mixture of two solid solutions cubic (depleted ZnO) and wurtzite (enriched ZnO). In 
the case of solid solutions with low (x  0.2, 0.1) ZnO content, a more complicated behavior is 
observed 8. Due to the thermodynamic instability of cubic FeO (wstite) at temperatures below 
843 K, weak lines of Fe and spinel (Fd3m) phase (probably of Zn1yFeyFe2O4 composition) 
appear in the Xray diffraction patterns when these solid solutions are heated above 700 K. Then the 
intensity of these lines decreases and at temperatures above 900 K they disappear completely 8. At 
the same time, the formation of solid solutions with wurtzite structure is not observed up to 1100 K 
(the maximum temperature reached in the experiment).

Description:
Has the largest magnetic anisotropy constant among 3d metal monoxides and a wide region of oxygen nonstoichiometry.

Text:
In the literature there are data on structural, optical and magnetic properties of cubic solid solutions 
in the NiOZnO 1214, MgOZnO 15,16 and MnOZnO 17 systems, while solid solutions of 
the FeOZnO system remain poorly studied. The latter system is of particular interest because in the 
series of 3d metal monoxides FeO (wstite) has the largest magnetic anisotropy constant 18, the 
widest region of oxygen nonstoichiometry, which accounts for its high specific electrical 
conductivity 19,20 of the hole type (ptype) 21. In contrast, zinc oxide (wZnO) remains a wide
gap ntype semiconductor even after treatment at high temperatures and pressures 22.
