Description:
A metal ion that is a cofactor for classes I, II, and IV HDAC enzymes.

Text:
Class II is further subdivided into subclasses IIa (HDAC4, 
5, 7, and 9) and IIb (HDAC6 and 10). Class III enzymes, also called sirtuins (Sirt17), are not zinc
dependent like classes I, II, and IV, but use NAD as a cofactor. Class IV consists only of one isoform 
(HDAC11). In the last thirty years, HDACs and their inhibitors have become a subject of research for many drug 
discovery scientists. This research led to the development and FDA approval of five different HDAC 
inhibitors vorinostat, panobinostat, belinostat, romidepsin, and, as of March 2024, givinostat (Figure 
1A). 3 The approved inhibitors are all indicated for hematological cancers, with the exception of 
givinostat, which was the first nonsteroidal drug approved for the treatment of Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD).
