Description:
A gas that can be selectively and reversibly adsorbed by amine-functionalized dobpdc frameworks.

Text:
The framework M2(dobpdc) (dobpdc  4,4dioxidobiphenyl3,3dicarboxylate) 
(Figure 1a) can straightforwardly be functionalised with amines to yield a family of (amine)
M2(dobpdc) adsorbents (Figure 1b).14 These adsorbents have large capacities for selective and 
reversible CO2 uptake, and the adsorption thermodynamics can be tuned by varying the 
amine,11,2427 and the metal.14,28,29 Importantly, these materials generally display steep 
adsorption isotherms making them promising for a range of energy efficient carbon capture 
applications.24,25 Initial characterisation of CO2 adsorption modes in these materials has 
revealed a rich chemistry, with three CO2 adsorption products proposed to date (i) 
ammonium carbamate chains (Figure 1c), thought to be the dominant product in a range of
