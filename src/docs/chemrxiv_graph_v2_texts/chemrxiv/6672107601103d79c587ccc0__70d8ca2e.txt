Description:
A metal used in solid electrolytes and electrolysis cells.

Text:
Lithium penetration into solid electrolytes (termed Li intrusion) limits charging rate and poses 
safety concerns in solidstate batteries1,2 as well as in electrolysis cells for extracting lithium 
metal3,4 and separating hydrogen isotopes5. In brittle garnet solid electrolytes, mechanical 
imperfection in solid electrolytes is a key cause of Li intrusions, including surface defects such 
as nanoscale cracks69 and internal defects such as voids and grain boundaries1015.

Description:
Metallic lithium formed during electroplating builds up stress and propagates cracks.

Text:
Metallic 
lithium formed during electroplating at these defects builds up stress and propagates cracks once 
the electrolyte fracture strength is exceeded.79 Electronic conductivity and trapped electrons at 
these defects can further promote metallic lithium nucleation and growth inside of the solid 
electrolyte.1315 Conceptually, three key components contribute to the Li intrusion process 
defects, which serve as the active sites for Li intrusion initiation; local current density at these 
defects, which acts as the driving force for electrochemical stress accumulation; and the solid 
electrolytes fracture strength, which determines the critical current density at which an intrusion 
is initiated. In brittle solid electrolytes, nanoscale defects (particularly nanocracks) form easily during 
processing and handling due to the brittle nature of oxide ceramics, even for high density 
samples.
