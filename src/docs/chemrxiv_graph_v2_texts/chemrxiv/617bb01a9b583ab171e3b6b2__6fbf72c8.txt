Description:
A metal center with highly reducing character and oxophilic nature, used in reductive coupling of CO.

Text:
Molecular lowvalent fblock complexes 
based on U(III) and Ln(II) metal centers have shown very promising reactivity in the reductive coupling of 
CO, which can be traced back to their highly reducing character and oxophilic nature.17 Detailed 
experimental17df,17j and computational studies17f,18 have been performed by Cloke, Green, Maron and co
workers in order to rationalize the CO reductive coupling reactivity by bulky U(III) sandwich complexes. Depending on the reaction conditions and steric bulk of the supporting ligands, selective formation of 
oxocarbon dianions of the type ethynediolate (A), deltate (B) or squarate (C) was reported (Figure 1). DFT 
calculations pointed to a zigzag intermediate complex featuring a bridging transbent C2O22 dianion 
as a key intermediate in the formation of the different species.
