Description:
Substances that interact with materials like MOFs to enhance catalytic properties and sensing mechanisms.

Text:
Kinetically labile bonds between metals and ligands can allow access to coordinatively unsaturated 
metal sites24 that endow MOFs with catalytic properties,57 enhance their interactions with sorbates 
such as H2,811 and offer potential sensing mechanisms.1214 Dynamic SBU solvent substitution can 
facilitate structural flexibility15,16 and metalion exchange,17,18 while also offering routes to pore 
functionalisation through linker exchange,1822 linker incorporationgrafting,2326 and defect 
substitution.2733 Coordinative exchange reactions may also be responsible for MOF degradation, for 
example through hydrolysis.34 To date, most studies on such reactions within MOFs focus on either 
binding and removal of neutral solvent molecules,35 or direct exchange of carboxylate andor 
pyridylbased ligands, despite the fact that a significant number of commonly observed SBUs 
contain bridging oxo or hydroxo ligands.36 Some of us have recently developed solidstate (and in 
particular 17O) NMR spectroscopy as a valuable analytical tool to study structural and chemical 
changes in microporous materials such as MOFs and zeolites.3740 In doing so, we have shown that 
the bridging 2OH ligand in the onedimensional chain SBU of MIL53(Sc), ScOH(BDC)n (BDC 
 1,4benzenedicarboxylate), is labile, observing up to 25 enrichment with 17O by reaction with 
H217O (90 17O) under hydrothermal conditions (200 C, 72 h).38 Allied to the fact that MIL53 
analogues are known with alternative anionic4143 and neutral4446 bridging ligands, this suggests a 
rich potential reactivity at this particular SBU.
