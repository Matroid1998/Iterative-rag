Description:
An exception among Ln(III) ions that does not behave like a free ion in coordination complexes.

The properties of lanthanide (Ln) compounds have made them prime research candidates 
in the field of magnetism,1 optics,2 and catalysis.3 Control of magnetism and optical properties, 
which arise from the 4f electrons, is highly desired in materials science. The stereotypical 
understanding of the 4f electrons is often considered to be localized (corelike). They do not 
undergo large crystal fields (CF) splitting; thus, Ln(III) ions (except for Ce(III) or Ln(II) ions) in 
coordination complexes mainly behave like free ions. Lnbased singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) are a crucial subject for molecular spintronics, 
in which the molecular spin is utilized for information processing. Previous studies have shown 
that Dy complexes have strong magnetic anisotropies and large activation barriers (E) of spin 
flipping among spin up and spin down states.
