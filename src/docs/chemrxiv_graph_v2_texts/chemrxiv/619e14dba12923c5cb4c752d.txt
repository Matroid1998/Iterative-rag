Description:
A material involved in challenging dispersion-driven interactions with water molecules.

Text:
In this paper, we investigate the performance of regularized
MP2like methods for some prototypical periodic systems,
which each constitute known issues for canonical MP2. In
particular, we consider the homogeneous electron gas (a metal
prototype), the onedimensional Hubbard model (a strongly
correlated system) and the interaction of graphene with a
water molecule (a challenging dispersiondriven interaction). We also propose a new, nonempirical regularization method
based on secondorder BrillouinWigner perturbation theory. II. THEORY
In the following we use indices i, j,k,l for occupied and
a,b,c,d for unoccupied spinorbitals , respectively. Anti
symmetrized twoelectron repulsion integrals in this basis are
denoted as ijab. Using this notation, the MP2 correlation
energy can be written as
