Description:
A PPI inhibitor that has progressed to phase III clinical trials to prevent major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

Proteinprotein interactions (PPI) have increased attention as therapeutic macromolecular targets 1,2. Designing PPI inhibitors is challenging because they have distinct molecular properties and occupy 
regions of chemical space differently from conventional smallmolecule drugs 3. For instance, PPI 
inhibitors are larger, more hydrophobic, have more aromatic rings, and have distinct threedimensional 
conformations compared to traditional smallmolecule drugs 4. In general, the properties of PPI 
inhibitors are significantly different from traditional drug candidates 5. In recent years, significant efforts 
have been made to develop PPI inhibitors 6, resulting in many PPI inhibitors in clinical trials 7 (Figure 
1). An example is apabetalone, which has progressed to phase III clinical trials to prevent major adverse 
cardiovascular events in highrisk type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
