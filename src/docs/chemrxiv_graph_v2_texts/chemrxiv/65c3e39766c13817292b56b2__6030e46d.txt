Description:
Adsorption in amine-functionalized MOFs is a focus of chemisorption process studies.

Text:
This can be physi
cally realized by soaking a M2(dobpdc) preparation in amine
solution15,19. There are different classes of amines be
ing studied for carbon capture applications, most commonly
diamines15,17,18,2024 (wherein the molecule has two amine
groups) and tetramines19 (wherein the molecule has four
amine groups). This enhanced capability comes with an in
crease in complexity and size of the search space. The need
to predict, from first principles, the structure of a hypothetical
MOF  amine combination is thus crucial for material discov
ery. There
is
a
wealth
of
experimental14,15,17,1926
and
theoretical2632 literature exploring the fundamentals of the
chemisorption process. The general understanding is that CO2
adsorption in aminefunctionalized MOFs mostly manifests in
