Description:
Species that are adsorbed on bridge sites of the Ag cluster during oxidation.

Text:
Several computational studies have been published. Salaev and coworkers8 studied the oxidation of ethy
lene glycol on silver cluster catalysts. Their findings
suggested that ethylene glycol undergoes oxidation to
glyoxal when oxygen species are adsorbed on bridge sites
of the Ag cluster. Partial oxidation to ethylenedioxy
