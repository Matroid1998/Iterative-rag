Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies to mitigate the
excessive amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere 1, 2, 3. Renewable electricity can be used to power the conversion of
CO2 into different hydrocarbon molecules, which can then be utilized as fuels, energy storage media and chemicals for
various industrial applications such as plastic production, preservatives and anti freezing. However, there are several
challenges for such a technology to be fully functional under industrially relevant operating conditions. A lot of these
challenges stem from the gap in knowledge about the exact physicochemical phenomena taking place in the immediate
environment of the catalyst surface.
