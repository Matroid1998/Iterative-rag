Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds in supramolecular assemblies.

In specific 
cases, it was found that the role of the sergeant could be 
modified by the effect of light21 or chemical reactivity.29 It would 
thus be highly advantageous to modify the structure and 
properties of sergeantsandsoldiers (SS)type copolymers by 
addition of a third component, that would be able to induce the 
desired functions to the multicomponent architecture.30,31 
Water was recently shown to be able to intercalate into hydrogen
bonded assemblies of biphenyl tetracarboxamides in alkanes, 
leading to SStype polymers with tuneable and multiple helical 
states.32,33 Desolvation of monomer side chains may also play a 
key role in biasing and inverting the screw sense of hydrogen
bonded supramolecular (co)polymers.34,35 In addition to these 
intriguing effects displayed by small molecules, it seems 
opportune to use a third component for which the amount can be 
precisely tuned.
