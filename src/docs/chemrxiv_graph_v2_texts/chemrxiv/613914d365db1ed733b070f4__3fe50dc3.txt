Eutrophication of surface and freshwater sources remains a serious issue in todays
society with wide reaching economic and environmental consequences. The weathering
and erosion of bedrock represent natural processes that affect the phosphorus levels in
many lakes 1. However, it is undeniable that anthropogenic sources, such as
agricultural runoff, municipal wastewater and industrial effluence, greatly contribute to
the eutrophication of aquatic systems. The anthropogenic enrichment of phosphorus in
such bodies of water not only contribute to the deterioration of the water quality but also
lead to oxygen depletion due to the excessive growth of aquatic plants and microalgae. Resulting in detrimental effects on the marine ecosystem 2, 3.
