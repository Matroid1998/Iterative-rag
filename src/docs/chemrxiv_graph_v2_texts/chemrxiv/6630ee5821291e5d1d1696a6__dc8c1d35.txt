Description:
Gaseous hydrocarbons are the most abundant, atom-efficient, and economically viable carbon-based feedstocks.

In recent years, the direct and selective conversion of alkanes into fine chemicals has garnered 
significant attention within the scientific community.1,2 This surge in interest stems from a 
growing desire to introduce sp3character into organic molecules, which matches more with the 
3Dnature of protein targets, thereby enhancing their efficacy and reducing attrition rates.3,4 
Moreover, direct activation of aliphatic CH bonds allows practitioners to bypass the use of 
functionalized molecules, such as haloalkanes or organometallic reagents, enabling the direct 
use of feedstock materials into the latestage modification of drugs, agrochemicals, and 
materials.5,6 Notably, gaseous hydrocarbons stand out as the most abundant, atomefficient, 
and economically viable carbonbased feedstocks.

Description:
Gaseous hydrocarbons are predominantly utilized as energy sources in combustion processes.

Despite their prevalence, the CH bonds 
present in these molecules exhibit extraordinary inertness, rendering conventional synthetic 
methodologies for converting gaseous hydrocarbons into functionalized derivatives often 
ineffective or lacking in selectivity (Scheme 1A).7 As a consequence, gaseous hydrocarbons 
are predominantly utilized as energy sources in combustion processes. In modern synthetic chemistry, arylation reactions serve as indispensable tools for assembling 
building blocks relevant to medicinal and crop science applications.812 Consequently, 
transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling has emerged as the gold standard for assembling such 
units, often achieved through the combination of prefunctionalized starting materials, including 
aryl or alkyl halides and organometallic reagents.13 While these prefunctionalized fragments 
offer high chemofidelity, they also come with drawbacks such as low atom economy, high 
toxicity, and often moisture and air instability.
