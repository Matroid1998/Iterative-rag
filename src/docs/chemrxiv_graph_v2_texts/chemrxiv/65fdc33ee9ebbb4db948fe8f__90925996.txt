Description:
A promising electrode material for battery applications due to its layered structure and high theoretical capacity.

Text:
These properties have made MoS2 highly desirable in many 
research domains including heterojunction solar cells,3,4 electrophotocatalysis,5,6 strain 
sensors7 and thermoelectric devices.8 Particularly, the layered structure composed of SMo
S slabs provides highly accessible sites, resulting in MoS2 being a promising electrode material 
for battery applications.912 In the area of potassiumion batteries (PIBs) where the large size 
of Kion poses a major challenge for electrode materials discovery, the wide interlayer spacing 
(0.62 nm) and weak Van der Waals interaction between the SMoS slabs can effectively 
accommodate Kions and lower the energy barrier of Kion diffusion. The capability to transfer 
up to four electrons per MoS2 formula indicates a high theoretical capacity (670 mAh g1).

Description:
An anode material for PIBs with issues of poor electronic conductivity and structural instability.

Text:
These advantages have made MoS2 one of the most studied anode materials of PIBs.10,1315 
A great deal of research attention has been directed towards enhancing the PIB performance of 
MoS2 by addressing issues such as poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. Carbon coating1618 and phase engineering (1T phase and 1T2H mixed phase)1922 can 
improve electron transfer owing to the presence of carbon and the metallic nature of the 1T 
phase (10100 S cm1),23 respectively.

Description:
A material whose structural stability can be enhanced by expanding interlayer spacing and tuning morphology to relieve strain during K-ion insertion.

Text:
Structural stability can be strengthened by expanding 
interlayer spacing 2426 and tuning the morphology andor dimensionality of MoS2 to relieve 
the strain in vertical and radial directions during Kion insertion.27,28 While progress has been 
made to driving the PIB performance development of MoS2, understanding of the 
electrochemical mechanism to store Kions has not been progressed to the same extent as 
performance development, due to the complexity in phase transition and kinetic processes
