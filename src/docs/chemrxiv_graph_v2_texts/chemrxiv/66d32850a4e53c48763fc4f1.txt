Description:
Involved in hydrogen atom transfer reactions, crucial for chemical and biological processes.

Text:
Hydrogenatom transfer (HAT) reactions involve the transfer of a hydrogen atom from one
species to another, and they play a crucial role in many chemical and biological processes,
including organic reactions and catalysis,112 drug development,13,14 and sustainable energy
solutions.15
Theoretical predictions of the reaction rates of HAT reactions are challenging. A popular
approach is transition state theory (TST).1619 Keys to the success of TST are variational de
termination of the transition state, accurate estimation of the free energy difference between
the reactants and the transition state, and a reliable tunneling transmission coefficient.
