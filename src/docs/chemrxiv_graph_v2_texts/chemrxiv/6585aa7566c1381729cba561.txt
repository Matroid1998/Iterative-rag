Description:
A metal oxide that can be formed through electrochemical anodization.

Text:
Among them, 
electrochemical anodization is a simple, lowcost, and efficient surface modification 
method that produces a stable oxide layer on the metal surface. Anodically grown 
metal oxides cover the surfaces of metals uniformly and have longterm durability and 
excellent corrosion and abrasion resistance. Oxide thickness of several hundred 
nanometers to micrometers as well as surface morphology in the form of compact, 
nanotubular, porous or a variety of further structures can be easily reached by adjusting 
the anodization parameters, these include applied voltage, time, composition, and 
concentration of the electrolyte, pH and temperature.13,14 With this method, a wide 
range of metal oxides can be formed including Al2O3, TiO2, and Nb2O5, just to name a 
few.15
