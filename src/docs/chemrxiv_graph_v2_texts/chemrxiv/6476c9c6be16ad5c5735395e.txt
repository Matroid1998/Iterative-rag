Description:
Causes a bathochromic shift in absorption spectra when titrated with 9hydroxy derivative 3a.

Text:
It was clearly proved that almost 
the same absorption spectra was observed for methyl ether 4 both in the absence or presence of DBU 
or TFA (Figure 2c). Interestingly, the chromic properties of 9hydroxy derivative 3a were different 
from those of 1hydroxy derivative 2a. Although 3a exhibits major bands at 400 nm (moderate) and 
410530 nm (broad, weak) under neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, the absorption at longer 
wavelengths is redshifted to 420630 nm upon titration with DBU. The bathochromic shift was 
saturated with the addition of 30 equivalents of DBU (Figure 2d). The colour of the solution turned
