Description:
Favourable nodes for acetylene hydrogenation as part of a MOF.

Text:
with open FeIII sites,22 show 
promising results. Research on palladium catalysts supported on 
MOF structures has also been in the focus with Pd supported on 
MOF523, PdUiO6724, PdMil5325 or PdZIFL26. To the 
best of our knowledge, no studies on acetylene hydrogenation 
with favourable Pd2 nodes as part of a MOF itself have been 
reported, yet.
