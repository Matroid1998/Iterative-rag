Description:
Used for angstrom-confinement in the electrochemical synthesis of 2D transition metal oxides.

Early trials with 
electrochemical growth of Pd into graphene layers yielded promising results with thin Pd sheets 
of 5 nm thickness.39 It is thus compelling to wonder which thickness can be achieved in 
bottomup electrochemical synthesis of 2D nonvdW materials via space confinement. Here, we firstly report a controlled electrochemical method to obtain (sub) unit cell thick 2D 
transition metal oxides, like Cr2O3, Fe2O3, by using the angstromconfinement of stacked 
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers. The 2D holey polycrystalline network of Cr2O3 and 
Fe2O3 is only 4.5  and 5.4  thick respectively.
