Description:
A small-molecule covalent fragment bearing a weaker electrophile used to examine cysteine ligandability.

Text:
There has been an exciting revolution in chemical biology to examine the proteomewide reactivity 
and ligandability of cysteine residues using mass spectrometry proteomics. These studies have served as a 
starting point for identification of new ligandable protein targets and the development of covalent probes and 
drugs.25,26 Cysteine reactivity across the proteome is generally assessed by measuring labeling efficiency 
with a highly reactive iodoacetamide probe.27,28 Cysteine ligandability, on the other hand, is examined by 
treating the proteome with smallmolecule covalent fragments bearing weaker electrophiles, like 
chloroacetamide or acrylamide, followed by treatment with an iodoacetamide probe.
