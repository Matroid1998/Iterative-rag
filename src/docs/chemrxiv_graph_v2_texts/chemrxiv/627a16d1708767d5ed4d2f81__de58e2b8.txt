Description:
A linear cation used to form a 3D network with dimers of edge-sharing octahedra.

For example, in the series of linear cations of general formula NH3(CH2)mNH32 (m 
 4, 7, 8, 10, 12), the cations with even carbonchain lengths formed 2D perovskites, while 
those with odd carbon chain lengths formed a 1D structure.4 Very recently, the structural 
diversity of systems incorporating a diammonium cations has been further expanded towards 
3D halide perovskitoids using linear cations such as 1,4butanediamine (1,4BDA), N,N
dimethyl1,3propanediamine (NMPA), or N,Ndimethylethylenediamine (DMEA) providing a 
structural motif comprising dimers with edgesharing octahedra which are then connected 
through cornersharing bond to form a 3D network.5 In these systems, the optical properties are 
close to traditional 3D MHPs with the bandgap being mainly influenced by standard octahedra 
distortion parameters.
