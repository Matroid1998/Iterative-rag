Description:
Formed through cycloaddition of BCBs and alkenes.

Text:
By utilizing the photoinduced energy transfer course, 
Glorius6a and Brown6b groups respectively described ele
gant cycloaddition of BCBs and alkenes toward bicy
clo2.1.1hexanes. The reaction was initiated by the excita
tion of either alkene or BCB to generate a diradical interme
diate. Li7a and Wang7c groups developed a borylpyridine 
catalytic system to activate BCB as a cyclobutyl radical in
termediate.
