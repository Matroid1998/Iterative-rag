Description:
Used as an anode in commercial lithium ion batteries, replacing lithium metal due to safety issues.

Lithium metal has been the holy grail of anode materials for Li batteries, since the first usage in the 
1960s, boasting the highest theoretical capacity at 3860 mAh g1, the lowest possible electrochemical 
potential, 3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, and a low mass density.14 Despite its desirable 
parameters, safety issues stemming from dendritic growth of lithium, short circuiting and subsequent 
ignition of the liquid electrolyte, have led to its replacement by the graphite anode in commercial 
lithium ion batteries.14 Through the usage of nonflammable solid electrolytes which are compatible 
with lithium metal, such as the oxide garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), safety concerns can be remedied and 
a resurgence of the lithium metal anode is possible.5,6 
The problem of dendritic growth remains though, still present in solid electrolytes, which are prone 
to being cracked by lithium dendrites, even when the material is mechanically stronger than lithium 
metal.
