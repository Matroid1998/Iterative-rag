Pyrazinamide disrupts the metabolism of energy and creates an acidic 
environment. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis by targeting InhA. Rifampicin 
binds to the RNA polymerase, inhibiting transcription 4. Treatment plans for TB infection using isoniazid were usually given with other drugs, 
such as rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin, ranging from 4 to 9 
months 5. Isoniazid is classified as an antibiotic given as one of the multipledrug 
regimens or as a monotherapy used when treating latent and active TB. However, latent 
TB is now commonly given Rifampinbased treatment 6. Although less used in treating 
latent TB, the use of isoniazid in active TB is still relevant and widely spread, with it 
being the most recommended treatment to counteract TB infection.
