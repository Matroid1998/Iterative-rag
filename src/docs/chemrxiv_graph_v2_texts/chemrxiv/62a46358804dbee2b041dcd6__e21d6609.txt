Description:
Loaded onto silicaaluminas by wet impregnation for catalytic applications.

Text:
Namely, a set of amorphous silicaaluminas were 
tested in nitrogen physisorption experiments before and after loading them with nickel and 
molybdenum oxide by wet impregnation.33,34 These materials are normally applied for 
hydroprocessing reactions.3537 The paper fulfills two purposes. First, providing practical 
guidance on how to qualitatively analyze the data measured during nitrogen physisorption
