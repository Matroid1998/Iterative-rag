Description:
Chains carrying one drug molecule at the chain end through controlled radical polymerization.

To 
alleviate these limitations, it is possible to take advantage of the polymer prodrug approach, 
which involves coupling drugs to a polymer scaffold via a cleavable linker, resulting in transient 
drug inactivation.1519 In this context, we have recently reported the design and the preclinical 
evaluation of watersoluble polymer prodrugs suitable for the SC delivery of vesicant and 
irritant anticancer drugs.20 The principle is based on the druginitiated synthesis of well
controlled polyacrylamide (PAAm) chains carrying one drug molecule at the chain end through 
the use of a drugbearing controlling agent to perform controlled radical polymerization of AAm.
