Description:
A less toxic alternative to lead in perovskite materials.

Text:
Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, 
and has become particularly important in analysis of metal halide perovskites.1 This class of 
materials has been of intense interest for over a decade because of potential applications as 
photovoltaic absorbers, rivalling well established technologies owing to their remarkable 
optoelectronic properties, facile processing routes and commerciallyrelevant PCEs.2 An important 
focus of current perovskite research is the substitution of lead for less toxic tin.3 Sn(II) has a 5s2 
valence electron configuration, analogous to the 6s2 configuration of Pb(II).4 Tin based perovskites 
typically display narrower band gaps and may avoid the need for encapsulation, which is necessary 
for Pbbased perovskites.5 
Sn based perovskites have shown a significant increase in photovoltaic efficiency in the past decade, 
but one of the key challenges is control of oxidation state.
