The quantitative description of statetostate dynamics properties comparable to 
experiments needs full dimensional quantum mechanical (QM) calculations based on 
accurate and global potential energy surfaces (PES). In the case of polyatomic systems 
this goal is far from being achieved. Recently, our group has analysed this problem1 by 
studying the current status of the X  C2H6 X H, F(2P), Cl(2P), O(3P), OH hydrogen 
abstraction reactions. We concluded that the experimenttheory comparison worsens 
when we go from macroscopic properties (average properties, such as the rate constants) 
to microscopic properties (statetostate properties, such as product vibrational 
distribution).
