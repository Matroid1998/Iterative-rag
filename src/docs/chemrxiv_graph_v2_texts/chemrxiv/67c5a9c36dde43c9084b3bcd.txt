Description:
A mineral whose shape anisotropy is related to its photocatalytic behaviour.

Text:
Nonetheless, a few recent studies have 
shown that the different shapes (shape anisotropy) of the same nanoscale materials can exhibit 
different catalytic efficiency, but lack an appropriate justification and theoretical support visvis 
lightmatter interaction and the interfacial dynamics.7,8 In the case of iron as a mineral, the 
understanding of the origin and evolution of shape anisotropy and its relation to photocatalytic 
behaviour can inform both the geochemical processes and sustainable photocatalyst design.9 
Interestingly, we reported a similar anisotropydependent photocatalytic behaviour in our previous 
study of zinc and germanium oxide nanoparticles.7,8 Moreover, beyond the claims of Kleber et al. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025849qs ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000878153206 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
