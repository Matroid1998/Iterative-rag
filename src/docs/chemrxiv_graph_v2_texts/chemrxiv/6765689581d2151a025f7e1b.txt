Description:
A stable perovskite structure with slight distortions, used in solar cell applications with efficiencies over 20%.

Text:
Perovskite solar cell (PSC) materials have garnered significant attention in the 
field of PV due to their exceptional lightabsorbing properties and ease of fabrication.2
10 The inception of PSCs dates back to the early 2000s, when researchers began 
exploring organicinorganic hybrid PSCs as potential candidates for converting sunlight 
into electricity.11 Currently, the maximum efficiency reported for PSCs is 26.7 
.3,1214 
One of the main issues with organicinorganic PSCs is their decomposition due to volatile 
organic cations.15,16 One of the strategies to solve this problem is the use of inorganic 
cations to improve the PSC stability.17,18 CsPbI3 perovskites emerged as promising 
materials for solar cell applications,1921 demonstrating chargecarrier mobilities 
comparable to those of organicinorganic PSCs, presenting efficiencies over 20.22 
Additionally, with a Goldshmidt tolerance factor favorable for cubic perovskites,2326 
CsPbI3 is a stable perovskite structure with slight distortions that prone to some degree of 
structural deformation.

Description:
Perovskites that exhibit various defects including vacancies, uncoordinated cations, and antisite defects on their surfaces and interfaces.

Text:
The presence of defects 
is commonly related to the nonradiative recombination of the electronhole pair, mainly 
due to the formation of trap states, prompting a decay in the PSCs performance.2836 
CsPbI3 perovskites exhibit various defects including vacancies, uncoordinated cations, 
and antisite defects on their surfaces and interfaces.3742 Vacancies occur when an ion 
is missing from its lattice site, interstitial defects occur when an ion occupies an interstitial 
position, and antisite defects are generated when an atom or ion takes the place of another
