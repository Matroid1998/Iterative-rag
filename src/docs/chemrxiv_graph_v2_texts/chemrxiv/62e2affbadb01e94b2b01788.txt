The use of CO2 as a carbon feedstock will be an important component of a sustainable postfossilfuel future. CO2 can be electrochemically reduced into variety of products including hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbon 
monoxide (CO) and formate (HCOO). Recent technoeconomic analyses suggest that twoelectron reduction 
of CO2 into C1 products (i.e., HCOO and CO) presents the best route to economic feasibility in the near future.1
4 CO and HCOO are essential feedstock used in various industrial applications ranging from chemical synthesis 
(FisherTropsch) to energy conversion (e.g., fuel cells) through existing and emerging technologies.59 The 
realization of electrochemical synthesis of these important molecules at large scale will require catalysts with 
high activity and selectivity to the desired products, exceptional stability, sufficient Earthabundance, and broad 
availability.

A compound involved in electroreduction processes to produce various chemicals.

New discoveries of improved catalysts, guided by a detailed understanding of structureactivity 
relationships, are needed in order to progress toward these targets. The selectivity of CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) is strongly dependent on the nature of the catalyst. Among the 
single metals which show CO2ER activity10, In and Sn are mainly HCOO producers, while Cu shows a unique 
ability to reduce CO2 into a wide range of products including C1 compounds (CO, HCOO and CH4) and C2 
hydrocarbons (C2H4, C2H5OH, and others), typically as an undesirable mixture. 6, 11 A variety of approaches, 
including surface nanostructuring1214, and tuning the electronic structure by modifying with a second metal, 
have been introduced to direct the selectivity of Cu towards a specific product.
