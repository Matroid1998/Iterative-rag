Description:
Amorphous TiO2 is used as a protection layer against corrosion in multilayer photoelectrochemical devices.

Text:
Understanding underlying processes behind the performance of multilayer photoelectrochemical (PEC) 
devices is crucial to their continued development. As an operando technique, electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is uniquely positioned to detect processes not only within individual 
layers, but also interactions between the layers themselves during device operation. These devices 
commonly employ amorphous TiO2 (aTiO2) as a protection layer against corrosion, because many 
established and emerging semiconductors themselves are unstable during photoelectrocatalysis.1,2
