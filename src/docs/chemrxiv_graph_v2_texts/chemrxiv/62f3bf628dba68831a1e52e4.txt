of donoracceptor interactions,24 by increased conjugation between building blocks,5 and by 
exfoliation of bulk catalysts to more accessible nanosheets with rates of hydrogen evolved 
exceeding 300 mmol h1 g1.6,7 Ideally, a sustainable catalyst should function without the addition 
of noblemetal cocatalysts, but the majority of current materials performs significantly worse 
without platinum additives. Previously, we have shown that organic photocatalysts retain a high 
hydrogen evolution activity in the absence of platinum only when strong intramolecular donor
acceptor interactions ensure an efficient separation of photoexcited electronhole pairs.2 In these 
examples, we achieved strong DA interactions by direct coupling of thiophenebased donors and 
triazinebased acceptors.
