Description:
Used to fabricate single-molecule junctions with outstanding properties.

Text:
Depending on the degree of aromaticity and the number of sextets available the 
diradicaloid character  can be tuned, with  1 representing pure diradical behaviour.19 Particularly 
attractive in these materials is that the synthetic process is relatively mild, with only a latestage 
oxidation or reduction step delivering the reactive openshell species, thereby allowing large freedom 
in designing the synthetic pathway. Bench stability is generally imparted by steric protection, decorating 
the edges of the polycyclic hydrocarbon with bulky tbutyl or mesityl substituents, thereby reducing the 
chance of dimerization or decomposition. In this contribution, we show that diradicaloid species base on the (di)indenoacene family can be used 
to fabricate singlemolecule junctions, showing outstanding properties.
