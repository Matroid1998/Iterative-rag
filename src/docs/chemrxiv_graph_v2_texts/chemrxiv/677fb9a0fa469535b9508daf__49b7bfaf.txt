Materials
1,2distearoylsnglycero3phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2dipalmitoylsnglycero3phosphocholine (DPPC), methoxy
or carboxylterminated 1,2distearoylsnglycero3phosphoethanolamineN(polyethylene glycol)2k (DSPEPEG2k),
and 1,2dioleoyl3dimethylammoniumpropane (DODAP) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Choles
terol and poly(lactidecoglycolide) (Resomer RG 504 H, 5050 lactideglycolide, MW3854 kDa) were pur
chased from Merck. 2
