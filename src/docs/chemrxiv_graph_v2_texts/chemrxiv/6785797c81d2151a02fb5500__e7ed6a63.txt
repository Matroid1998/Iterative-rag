Description:
Used in the Ritter reaction with alkene-derived carbocations.

Text:
Within this area, the Ritter re
action offers a straightforward approach for synthetic chemists, 
harnessing alkene or alcoholderived carbocations and ni
triles.24 Since its inception in 1948,5,6 the Ritter reaction has 
undergone continuous development towards greener conditions 
and to broaden its precursor pool.7,8 Notably, the advent of oxi
dative radicalpolar crossover (RPC),9 which sequentially ex
ploits the reactivity of radicals and cations, has enabled the in
tegration of the Rittertype process into atom and stepeconom
ical multicomponent reactions (MCRs).10 In this regard, three
component alkene difunctionalizations11,12 represent a hot topic 
nowadays as (i) olefins are inexpensive and readily available 
organic feedstocks,13 and (ii) the introduction of two new, or
thogonal functionalities into the CC bond results in a rapid in
crease in molecular complexity, enhancing sp character and 
thereby contributing to the Escape from Flatland strategy in 
drug discovery.14,15 In recent years, various alkene difunction
alization protocols have incorporated the Rittertype amidation 
as the final step to trap the carbocation, generated via Giese
type addition and RPC of the radical intermediate, starting from 
both heteroatomic (N,16 O,17,18 P19 and S)20 and carboncentered 
radical precursors.
