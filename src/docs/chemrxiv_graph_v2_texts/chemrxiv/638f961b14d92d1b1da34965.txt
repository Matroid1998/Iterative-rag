Description:
A polymer with low dielectric constants, low glass transition temperatures, and maintains an amorphous state, but is barely ionically conductive without modification.

Ion mobility and ion concentration are the two key factors governing ionic conductivity
of a polymer; the former is not only directly related to the identity and quantity of cations
and anions, but is also greatly affected by the physical and chemical characteristics of the
polymer matrix bearing the ions.11 Polymers with low glass transition temperature and low
crystallinity are good candidates to achieve high ionic conductivity at room temperature for
practical applications.12 However, polyelectrolytes are predominantly made of polymers con
taining high polarity backbones to facilitate ion dissociation, which raise the glass transition
temperature or promote crystallinity by increasing intermolecular interactions.13 In contrast,
polymers with low dielectric constants, like PDMS, have low glass transition temperatures
and maintain an amorphous state, but are barely ionically conductive without modification
