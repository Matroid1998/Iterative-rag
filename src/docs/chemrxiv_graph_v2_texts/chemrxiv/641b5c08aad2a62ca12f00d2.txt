ANSOL is usually sold to mining industries, but there 
is an inconsistent demand and the existing methods involve thermal degradation of ANSOL, 
which is inefficient and not environmentally friendly. NH3 can be recovered from ANSOL by 
stripping after shifting the pH of the solution towards the alkaline side. This results in a large 
concentration of NO3 stream that is environmentally hazardous and it needs to be treated. In this study, we focus on coreducing NO3 and CO2 electrochemically to synthesize urea. Direct 
electrochemical coreduction of NO3 and CO2 is attractive as green urea can be produced in a 
decentralized manner with lower capital costs. Also, this study would help us provide insights 
into the electrochemical CN coupling, which is not explored extensively in the literature.
