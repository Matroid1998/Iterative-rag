Description:
A reactive species whose mass transport is affected by the electric double layer on the electrode surface.

Text:
This local environment of a CO2ER catalyst is thought to be a vital ingredient
determining the overall system performance 4. The concentrations of the solution species found in the vicinity of
the electrode end up affecting the properties of the catalyst and consequently the selectivities of the desired products
5, 6. The build up of cations on the surface of the electrode results in the formation of an electric double layer (EDL),
which affects the mass transport of reactive CO2 as well as the driving force for the interfacial charge transfer reactions. Hence, it becomes essential to develop models that properly take into account the mass transport, especially in this EDL
region, see Table 1.
