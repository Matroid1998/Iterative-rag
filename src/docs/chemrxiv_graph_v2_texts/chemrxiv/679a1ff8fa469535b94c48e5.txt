Description:
Fibres originating from plant cell walls.

Text:
After leaving the screw 
53 
region of the extruder, the hot protein melt is subjected to shear and temperature gradients in a cooling 
54 
die, in which anisotropic structures and textures develop (Cornet et al., 2022; van der Sman  van der 
55 
Goot, 2023). Protein blends, typically originating from soy or pea, contain around 70  90 protein 
56 
with the remainder being predominantly polysaccharide fibres originating from plant cell walls (Kumar 
57 
et al., 2021; Sari et al., 2015). Extrudates typically show a characteristic parabolic structure, which is 
58 
caused by high temperature and shear treatments in the cooling die (Fig. 1a). As such, the parabolic 
59 
flow profile correlates with higher anisotropy, whereas a plugflow profile correlates with lower 
60 
anisotropy (Zink et al., 2024).
