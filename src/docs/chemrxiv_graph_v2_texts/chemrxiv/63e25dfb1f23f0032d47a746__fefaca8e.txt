Description:
A component of sodium alginate, a linear anionic biopolymer.

The last few decades have witnessed a significant push to replace synthetic polymers for biodegradable 
natural polymers.1 Natural polymers composed of polysaccharides (cellulose, chitosan, alginate, etc.) or proteins (silk, fibroin, gelation) offer not only lowcost, wide availability, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability but also a rich chemical functionality towards custom modifications and new 
applications.2 Among those, and although cellulose3, 4 and chitosan5 are probably the most used 
biopolymers towards the development of analytical applications, sodium alginate (ALG) offers a number 
of competitive advantages. ALG is a linear anionic biopolymer extracted from brown algae, composed 
by Dmannuronate (M) and Lguluronate (G) units linked by 1,4 and 1,4 glycosidic bonds.
