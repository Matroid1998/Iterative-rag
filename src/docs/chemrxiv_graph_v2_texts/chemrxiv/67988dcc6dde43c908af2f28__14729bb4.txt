Description:
Detected at ppm level using high-resolution diode laser spectroscopy.

Text:
Ciaffoni et al.38 reported the BE (1.68  0.02 kcal mol1) for H2S dimer where highresolution diode laser 
spectroscopy has been applied for the detection of H2S at ppm level. They utilized different transitions within the 
region of the 1  2  3 and 21  2 combination bands around 1.58 m. Using microwave spectroscopy, Das et 
al.39 provided the geometrical parameters (i.e., SHS  2.778(9) and SHS  175(7)) of the H2S dimer. Dreux et al.35 calculated the BE for H2S dimer at the CCSD(T)ha(Qd)Z (where ha(Xd)Z represents ccpVQZ 
for H atoms and augccpV(Qd)Z for S atoms) level to be 1.66 kcal mol1.
