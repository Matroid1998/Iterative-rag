of an oxygen functional group as well as chlo
rine at the bridgehead position of the product was achieved, 
yielding 4Bf and 4Bg. Strikingly, by using onecarbon ho
mologated malonate 3h, we succeeded in constructing 66
6 tricyclic system 4Bh with good diastereoselectivity. Alt
hough the yield was not satisfactory, the use of 
propagylated 3i provided cyclic alkene 4Ai. Beyond malo
nate, ketoesters proved to be reactive substrates in the 
present reaction system. For example, a reaction with 3j af
forded 4Bj, albeit as a mixture of diastereoisomers in nearly 
a 11 ratio. Moreover, when a different type of keto ester 
3k was used, we obtained 666 tricyclic ketone 4Bk (ob
tained as its enol form) in 34 yield.
