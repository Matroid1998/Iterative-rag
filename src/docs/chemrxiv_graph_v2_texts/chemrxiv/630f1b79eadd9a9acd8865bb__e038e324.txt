Used in complexes with main group ligands for small molecule activation.

The reversible addition of H2 to metal sites is a fundamental step in catalysis. The importance 
of the reversibility of this step is perhaps most clearly illustrated in hydrogenfordeuterium 
(HD) exchange reactions. In its simplest form, HDexchange involves the selective isotopic 
labelling of molecules through reaction with D2. Catalysts which promote this type of HD
exchange must be capable of reversible activation of H2 (and its isotopomers). 2 
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of transition metal complexes 
bearing main group ligands for small molecule activation. Several systems incorporating B,1
8 AlIn,912, Zn1315 and Sn16 ligands have been reported for H2 activation.17 A number of 
potential mechanisms for H2 activation, some of which involve cooperative behaviour of the 
main group Scheme 1.
