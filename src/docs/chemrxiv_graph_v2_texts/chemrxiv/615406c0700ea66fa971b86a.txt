Description:
Superionic thermoelectric material with thermal conductivities below the theoretical minimum for solids.

Text:
Superionic conductors are sparking tremendous interest in multiple fields. While fast ionic 
conductors are searched for solid state batteries,1 they also often possess low lattice thermal 
conductivities essential for high thermoelectric efficiencies.24 In fact, many Ag and Cu 
superionic thermoelectric materials have thermal conductivities below the theoretical 
minimum thermal conductivity for solids, leading some to the suggestion that ion mobility 
makes these materials more liquidlike.2,4 However, no physical connections between thermal 
and ionic transport have thus far been shown. Recently, a foundational misconception within 
the concept of phonon liquid electron crystal2 was proven by showing that transverse phonon
