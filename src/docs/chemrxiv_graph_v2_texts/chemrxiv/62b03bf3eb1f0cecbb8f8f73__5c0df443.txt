Description:
Polymetallic clusters of NiII with a dependence of exchange interaction on the NiXNi bridging angle and anisotropy.

Text:
Interest in the magnetic properties of polymetallic clusters of NiII began with the development of 
magnetostructural correlations of Ni2 dimers1 and Ni4 cubanes2 that revealed a dependence of the 
sign and magnitude of the exchange interaction on both the NiXNi bridging angle and the anisotropy 
of the NiII ion.3 The large axial zerofield splitting displayed by the latter in certain geometries also 
lends itself to the construction of both singlemolecule magnets (SMMs)4 and singleion magnets 
(SIMs)5 displaying slow relaxation of the magnetisation.
