Description:
Used in FETs where surface charge can be modified at the solid-liquid interface.

modified the surface charge at the 
solidliquid interface of a Si FET using both front and back gate.5 More recently, Gupta et al. modulated the negatively charged SiO2 surface of Si FETs by depositing positively charged 
blocking molecules, improving sensitivity by 51.3 
 Among the various types of FET biosensors, graphene FET (GFET) biosensors have attracted 
particular attention owing to their extremely high electronhole mobilities6,7 and their two
