Description:
Used as baselabile protecting groups for unstable aldehydes and imines in nucleophilic addition chemistry.

Text:
By analogy to the use of sulfinic acid adducts as 
baselabile protecting groups for unstable aldehydes and imines in 
nucleophilic addition chemistry,8 Chen reported that the 
phenylsulfinic acid adduct of unsubstituted cyclopropanone 2a, a 
white crystalline solid, is more reactive and surprisingly well
behaved as compared with classical hemiketals, with equilibration 
to cyclopropanone taking place in mildly basic conditions at room 
temperature or below (Scheme 1c).9 We envisioned that such sta
bility and increased reactivity of 1sulfonylcyclopropanols could be 
key to unlocking the tremendous potential of cyclopropanone de
rivatives as synthetic intermediates, allowing reactions to proceed 
under mild conditions and thus suppressing undesired decomposi
tion pathways.

A leaving group with steric and electronic tunability.

Moreover, the steric and electronic tunability of the 
sulfinic acid leaving group in these compounds could prove benefi
cial to establishing a general class of cyclopropanone precursors. Scheme 1. Reactivity of cyclopropanone and its precursors
