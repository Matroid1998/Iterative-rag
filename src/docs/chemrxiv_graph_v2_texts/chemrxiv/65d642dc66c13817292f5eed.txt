Description:
A polymerizable tagging compound used in the last cycle of automated oligo synthesis.

Text:
Examples include but are not limited to cartridge purification,12 fluorous affinity 
purification,34 solid phase catchandrelease purification,56 and biotinstreptavidin mediated affinity 
purification.79 Among these efforts, our research group reported a method called catchingby
polymerization (CBP, Figure 1).1011 The CBP method involves tagging the fulllength sequences with a 
methacrylamide polymerizable tagging phosphoramidite (PTP, 1ad) in the last cycle of automated oligo 
synthesis. The failure sequences are capped with acetic anhydride, and thus are not tagged. After 
deprotection and cleavage under standard conditions, the crude product contains the desired fulllength 
oligos having a methacrylamide polymerizable group (2), and failure sequences (3) and other impurities 
that do not have a polymerizable group.
