Even though it is not yet clear which oxidized NiOOH phase is the more 
beneficial for the OER activity, it has been established that the presence of iron 
promotes the OER performance of the Nibearing electrodes in a plethora of Ni
bearing electrode systems711. Recently, a very simple method for preparing Fe
coated electrodes was reported, which involves the immersion of the Nibearing 
electrode in an Febearing solution4. Insitu spectroelectrochemistry has proven to be an efficient tool for 
understanding the reaction mechanisms during operando conditions3,12,13. In the 
majority of Nibearing samples, however, such measurements are possible on 
samples grown on suitable substrates (usually not nickel), which in turn may 
perplex the interpretation of the obtained results.

Hence, the aforementioned 
preparation method becomes quite appealing for preparing suitable Nibearing 
electrodes directly on nickel substrates, owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. In this work, we have investigated the OER performance of selected Fecoated 
Ni meshes (NM) prepared by directly immersing the respective Ni mesh in Fe
bearing solutions. Indeed, we were able to detect an enhancement of the OER 
performance for all of our samples. Our insitu Raman spectroscopic studies have 
captured the potentialinduced oxidation of Ni preceding the OER process. Careful 
analysis of the obtained Raman data has uncovered a direct link between the activity 
of the NM electrode and the Raman response of the active phase.
