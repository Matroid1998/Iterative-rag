Description:
Characterized by high toxicity and explosiveness, limiting its availability and utility in laboratory syntheses.

Text:
Despite the existing alternative approaches to 
preparation of AADDKs emerged in the literature, 1,2,13 inter
action of activated derivatives of Nprotected amino acids 
with diazomethane still remains the most efficient 
method.14 However, high toxicity and explosiveness of 
CH2N2 strongly limit both availability and utility of the 
AADDKs even in mediumscale laboratory syntheses.

Description:
Produced from Diazald and used in microreactors for chemical synthesis.

Text:
The productivity of the system 
has reached up to 90 g of CH2N2 per hour (2.1 molh). In 
2008, Chemtec Leuna also proposed a microreactor based 
on the generation of CH2N2 from Diazald.22 Corning Inc. has 
designed a reactor with the productivity up to 0.8 molh us
ing NmethylNnitrosourea (MNU) as CH2N2 source.23 An
other low productivity (0.1 molh ) flow reactor for diazo
methane preparation from MNU has been presented in 
2016.24 However, all the above setups have provided a wa
ter solution of diazomethane (a wet technology), suitable 
only for watertolerant reactions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023926vf ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000342818268 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
