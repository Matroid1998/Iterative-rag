Description:
A rheumatoid arthritis drug proposed as a repurposed drug for COVID-19 treatment and approved by the FDA for emergency use in combination with remdesivir.

Text:
The development of a drug requires on average more than two billion dollars and can take up to 1015 years. 8 This is why drug 
repurposing was considered a valuable strategy to deal with the pandemic caused by SARSCoV2 in a reasonable time. 9 In addition, 
computational discovery of repurposed drugs helps avoid costly trialanderror experiments, which require cell cultures, biochemical 
screening, and living systems. 10 Thus, baricitinib (rheumatoid arthritis drug) was proposed, using artificial intelligence techniques, 
as a repurposed drug11 and was subsequently approved as an emergency treatment by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) 
for the treatment of COVID19 in combination with redemsivir.
