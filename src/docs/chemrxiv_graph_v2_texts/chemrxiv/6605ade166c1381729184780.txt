as 
well as in the realm of protein engineering.16 Organisms with bioluminescence properties 
produce light through the oxidation of a substrate known as luciferin, a reaction that is 
catalyzed by a specific class of enzymes referred to as luciferases.2,7 Among the array of 
bioluminescent proteins, Renilla luciferase (RLuc) is particularly appropriate for its 
applications as bioluminescent tags.2 Unlike other bioluminescent proteins that depend 
on ATP, these enzymes function without ATP reliance. Instead, they require only the 
substrate and molecular oxygen, setting them apart in the field of bioluminescence. This 
36 kDa enzyme, derived from the sea pansy, Renilla reniformis catalyzes the oxidation of 
the substrate coelenterazine, an aromatic compound specifically characterized as 2(p
hydroxybenzyl)6(phydroxyphenyl)8benzylimidazo(1,2a)pyrazine3(7H)one.
