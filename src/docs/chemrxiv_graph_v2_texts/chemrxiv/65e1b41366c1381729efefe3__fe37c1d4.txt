Description:
A photoanode used in solar water oxidation.

Text:
The band positions of the metal oxide are 
based on a BiVO4 photoanode. The Fermi level of semiconductors and defect band position 
were obtained by DWE, KFPM, and valence state XPS analysis. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024n216n ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000275421147 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0

in TiO2. Furthermore, the unique properties of the PEI layer (e.g., preventing unfavorable band 
bending) facilitated selectivehole transfer between the metal oxide and TiO2 layer. Addressing 
the challenges related to unfavorable holeselective contact, the metal oxide photoanode 
modified with the hybrid TiO2 demonstrated feasibility in solar water oxidation with longterm 
stability.
