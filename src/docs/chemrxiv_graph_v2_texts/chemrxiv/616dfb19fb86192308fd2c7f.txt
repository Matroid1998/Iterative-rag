Description:
Active phase in catalytic materials, interacting with CeO2 to influence electronic structure and chemical properties.

Text:
Nanostructured materials based on ceria (CeO2) and Pt have a wide range of 
applications in catalysis, such as in the threeway conversion in automobile exhausts,1 in 
anode2 or cathode3 materials of fuel cells, or for mediating the water gas shift reaction,4 
among others.5 CeO2 is typically used in such materials as a noninert support for the 
more active Pt phase, leading to intricate metalsupport interactions that affect the 
electronic structure and chemical properties of both the metal and the oxide.4,68 These 
electronic metalsupport interactions further complicate the already challenging task of 
characterizing the properties of nanostructured catalytic materials, which are typically 
structurally complex.

Description:
Can be found in the form of nano or subnano particles or as single atoms anchored to the ceria surface or inserted in the ceria lattice.

Text:
Their size, structure, and oxidation state not only depend on 
preparation conditions, but also often undergo significant transformations under reaction 
conditions, as revealed by in situ or operando spectroscopic techniques.911 These 
structural and environmental complexities therefore hinder the straightforward 
computational modelling of working heterogeneous catalysts by means of first principles
based approaches.12,13 
For systems based on Pt and ceria, Pt can be found in the form of nano or subnano 
particles of varying size,4,7,14,15 or as single atoms either anchored to the ceria surface2,16
18 or inserted in the ceria lattice.1921 Atomically dispersed Pt on ceria substrates has been 
studied extensively by means of combined experiment and computational approaches 
during the last decade because they allow to significantly increase specific activity for 
different reactions.2,17,22 In such composites, Pt is often found in cationic form (i.e.
