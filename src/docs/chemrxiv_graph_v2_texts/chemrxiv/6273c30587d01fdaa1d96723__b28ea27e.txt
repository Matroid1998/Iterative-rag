Subject to electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R).

Computational abinitio
investigations with
Density Functional Theory (DFT) have pro
vided the basis for the mechanistic understand
ing of several electrochemical reactions, such
as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
oxygen evolution reaction (OER),14 electro
chemical CO2 reduction (CO2R),58 hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER).912 While reaction
thermodynamics for reactions involving proton
electron transfers are readily captured by the
computational hydrogen electrode,1 accurately
determining activation energies for these reac
tions remains a challenge. The main challenge to modelling abinitio
electrochemical barriers in periodic simulation
cells of feasible size is that the workfunction (of
ten used as an alias for the electrode potential)
changes by about 12 eV12,13 during the course
of a reaction involving an ionelectron pair or
adsorption of a polar intermediate.
