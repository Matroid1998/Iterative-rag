Description:
The chemical formula for carbamazepine, consisting of a tricyclic dibenzazepine system with a carboxamide group.

Given the sheer number of distinct 
PPCPs and the vast variations in their potential environmental impact,2,3,7,8 it is clear that a 
prioritization based on the occurrence and hazard potential of individual compounds (also 
considering their metabolites,9 decomposition products, and PPCP mixtures10) has to be 
developed in order to tackle these problems.8,11 
One particularly relevant PPCP contaminant is carbamazepine (5Hdibenzob,fazepine5
carboxamide, C15H12N2O, abbreviated CBZ in the following), an anticonvulsant that is widely 
used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.12 The CBZ molecule, shown in Figure 
1, consists of a tricyclic dibenzazepine system that carries a carboxamide (carbamoyl) group 
at the nitrogen atom of the azepine ring.
