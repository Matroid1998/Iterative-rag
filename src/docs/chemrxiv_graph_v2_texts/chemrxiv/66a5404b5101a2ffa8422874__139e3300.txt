Description:
A compound where charge migration occurs between the CC triple bond and iodine.

Text:
In the 
present computational study, we examine the ground and excited states of a series of haloacetylene cations, 
HCCX (X  F, Cl, Br, I), in preparation for future studies on the formation of coherent superpositions and 
the simulation of charge migration in these systems. Charge migration in HCCI has been studied extensively, both experimentally and computationally.4, 
1016 Strong field ionization of HCCI produces a coherent superposition of the X and A states of HCCI.4 
This results in charge migration between the CC triple bond and the iodine with a period of 1.87 fs.
