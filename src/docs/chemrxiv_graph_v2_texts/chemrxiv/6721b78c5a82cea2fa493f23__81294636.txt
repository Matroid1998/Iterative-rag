Description:
A compound with intricate molecular structure affecting its chemical behaviour and reaction mechanisms in combustion and pyrolysis.

Text:
The intricate molecular structure of JP10 necessitates a deeper understanding of its chemical 
behaviour and reaction mechanisms, particularly in the context of electronic structure, 
combustion, thermal decomposition, and pyrolysis. ExoTCD, the primary component of JP
10, has two significant conformations exochair and exoboat. These conformations differ in 
their stability and reactivity, which, in turn, affect JP10s ignition and combustion properties. Previous studies have revealed that the exochair isomer is the more energetically favourable 
conformation, with an energy difference of approximately 2.062.10 kcalmol relative to the 
exoboat isomer 46 . The energy barrier for converting between these isomers, especially 
under the hightemperature conditions required for JP10s combustion, underscores the 
importance of understanding their structural and energetic differences 7.
