Description:
A gas that can be captured from natural gas and flue gas of coal-fired power plants using porous solids.

Text:
Porous solids composed
of porous organic cage molecules4 have auspiciously demonstrated the ability to separate
gases5 in application to carbon dioxide capture from natural gas6 and ue gas of coalred
power plants,7,8 xenonkrypton separations,9,10 and sulfur hexaouride capture.11 Porous
cage solids with high adsorptive selectivities may serve as vapor sensors as well.12,13
Porous organic cages5,14,15 are molecules that harbor (i) a cavity that is intrinsic to their
molecular structure and (ii) windows through which gas molecules can enter the cavity.
