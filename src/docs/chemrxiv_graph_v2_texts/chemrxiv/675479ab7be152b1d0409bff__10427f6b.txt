Description:
Multidentate molecules containing three carboxylic acid groups and one azetidine ring able to bind metal ions forming water-soluble octahedral complexes.

Text:
MAs are all multidentate amino acids containing three carboxylic acid 
groups and one azetidine ring able to bind metal ions forming watersoluble octahedral 
complexes1317. The main phytosiderophore secreted by rice is 2deoxymugineic acid 
(DMA). Based on this, Suzuki et al.13 developed a synthetic analogue to the DMA ligand, 
proline2deoxymugineic acid (PDMA), which has analogous coordinating abilities to DMA, 
but it is easier to synthesise and more resistant to microbial decomposition. Therefore it was
