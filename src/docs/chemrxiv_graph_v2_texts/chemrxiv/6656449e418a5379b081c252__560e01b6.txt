Description:
Blocks the proton channel activity of the M2 protein by binding to the pore of the protein.

The M2 protein is of medicinal and biological interest since it is responsible for essential viral 
function including its activity as a proton channel11 and its role in viral budding.12 The drugs 
amantadine and rimantadine block the proton channel activity of the protein by binding to the pore 
of the protein near residues 2734.1315 Amphipathic helix residues, approximately residues 4760, 
have been shown to influence membrane curvature during budding.16 Cterminal to residue 60, the 
cytoplasmic tail of M2 has been shown to be important in virus assembly, with residues 7176 of 
the cytoplasmic tail in particular interacting with the viral protein M1.
