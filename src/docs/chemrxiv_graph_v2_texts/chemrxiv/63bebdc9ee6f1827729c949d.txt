Description:
Pigments in light-harvesting complexes that facilitate excitation energy transfer in photosynthesis.

Text:
In plants, mosses and green algae, sunlight is collected by lightharvesting pigmentprotein
complexes (LHCs) and rapidly funneled to the reaction centers (RCs) of photosystems. This
is made possible by the aggregate of interacting pigments contained in LHCs, chlorophylls
(Chls) and in minor part carotenoids (Cars), which create a path for the absorbed energy to
efficiently move in space and reach the RC via excitation energy transfer (EET) processes.

Description:
Excited chlorophylls undergo quenching and dissipate excess energy into heat in nonphotochemical quenching.

Text:
This functioning however is adaptable to the changing light conditions.1 In fact, in excess
light conditions, the LH process is replaced by quenching of the excited chlorophylls and the
dissipation of the excess energy into heat, in a process called nonphotochemical quenching
(NPQ).14 The major and most rapid NPQ component is energydependent quenching (qE),
which is triggered by a pH drop in the thylakoid lumen.24 In fact, increasing light intensity
causes lumen acidification and thus the generation of a pH gradient across the thylakoid
membrane, which acts as a reporter of the amount of absorbed energy.
