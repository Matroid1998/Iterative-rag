Description:
Forms single covalent bonds that are directional and fall between covalent and supramolecular interactions.

)8 that fall in an intermediate region between single covalent (2c2e bonds, like in 
I2) bonds and supramolecular interactions, which are, nevertheless, strongly directional.3,4 For 
this very reason, polyiodides have been a prime crucible for the elaboration of novel concepts, 
in general, in inorganic, physical, and also supramolecular chemistry. In the latter realm, 
namely, secondary bonds9,10 and halogen bonds11 (and actually further models in between)1214 
are here of special relevance. To that end, polyiodides have been generally approached with a 
reductionist approach, dismantling superior species in terms of complexes of the I2, I, and I3 
reassuring basic building blocks, often via an II experimental distancebased approach to 
differentiate them in covalently, secondaryhalogen, and nonbonded fragments.3,1517
