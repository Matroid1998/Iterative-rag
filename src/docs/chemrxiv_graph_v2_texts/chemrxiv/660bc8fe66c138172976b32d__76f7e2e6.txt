Description:
A metal-organic framework (MOF) that can be grown via localization to microcontact printed self-assembled monolayer patterns.

In the case of 
MOFs, an ongoing challenge is the development of methods for 
the precise spatial positioning of MOFs within such devices to 
enhance their performance whilst minimizing material wastage.14 
Bottomup approaches to MOF patterning include directed MOF 
growth, such as via localization of layerbylayer Cu3(btc)2 
growth to microcontact printed selfassembled monolayer (SAM) 
patterns,15 or the use of lithographically patterned wells to 
localize seed crystals and subsequent MOF growth.16 However, 
such 
multistep 
fabrications 
typically 
require 
specialized 
instrumentation, and careful control and can be relatively time
consuming. Further, as MOFs are typically fabricated as nano or 
microcrystalline powders, methods for the precise spatial 
deposition of such crystals are attractive for industrial 
applications.
