Description:
Macrocycles combining structural features of ansa metallocenes.

Text:
Porphyrins and their analogous are excellent scaffolds for 
advanced investigation of the macrocyclic  aromaticity. The 
aromaticity of various porphyrinoid systems has been extensively 
investigated.1 
Several 
factors, 
such 
as 
the 
molecular 
frameworks topology, the molecules conformation, metal 
coordination in the inner core, and tautomerism, can determine 
their electron conjugation. Figure 1. Delocalization through metallocenes (1, 2) and the metal center (3). The macrocycles combining the structural features of ansa
metallocenes and heteroporphyrin were obtained.
