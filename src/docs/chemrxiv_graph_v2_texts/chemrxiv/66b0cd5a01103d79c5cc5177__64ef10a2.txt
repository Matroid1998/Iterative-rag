The implementation of SF in photovoltaics is however
hampered by the lack of suitable materials fulfilling the
requirements for SF (a) an energy of the lowest singlet
state ES1 at least twice the one of the lowest triplet state
ET1 (ES12T1  ES1 2ET1 0); 4 (b) a delocal
ized or chargetransfer singlet exciton to promote direct
or chargetransfer mediated singlet fission mechanisms, re
spectively; 6 (c) triplets of sufficiently high energy for in
jection into the conduction band of a semiconductor cell
(ET1 Egap); 7 (d) synthesizability; and (e), photo and
chemical stability. 8 Experimentally investigated SF can
didate materials can be broadly classified as acene deriva
tives, rylenediimides, diketopyrrolopyrroles and conjugated
polymers.

Description:
Derivatives are the most studied SF materials.

Text:
8 Acene derivatives are the most studied SF ma
terials, and while their analysis has pushed the mechanis
tic understanding of SF, 9 they do not constitute desirable
materials for photovoltaic applications as they possess ei
ther too low triplet energies for injection into common semi
conductors (pentacenes) or slightly endothermic ES12T1
(tetracenes and anthracenes). 8,10 Therefore, expanding the
pool of SF materials is essential for realizing its potential in
solar cell applications. Previous attempts at discovering molecules suitable for
SF focused on modifications of known systems, such as
tuning their diradical character, adjusting conjugation,
or modifying heteroatom oxidation.
