Description:
Used in continuous methane oxidation with zeolites incorporating metaloxo centers.

Also, the secondary interactions23,24 and 
geometric effects of the host system (sometimes called secondsphere effects) can be exploited 
to control reaction mechanisms in nanoporous materials as recently shown by Snyder et al.25 The 
mobility of the CH3 radical involved in many mechanisms for methane activation proved to be a 
key factor in the activity of zeolites incorporating metaloxo centers, which have already been 
shown to be active for continuous methane oxidation using N2O and H2O.26 
In MOFs, ironoxo centers (FeO) have been successfully incorporated into the Fe2(dobdc) family 
(FeMOF74, dobdc42,5dioxido1,4benzenedicarboxylate) and have been shown to be 
catalytically active towards CH bond cleavage in experiment and theory.27,28 For the case of 
ethane to ethanol conversion, this MOF exhibited a high selectivity due to the strong binding of 
the product to the open metal sites, resulting, however, in a low yield27,29 in both flowthrough and 
batch operation modes as the reactive sites become blocked by the strongly bound product.
