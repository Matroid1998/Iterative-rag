For instance, vorinostat (histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitor), an FDAapproved drug indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with 
Tcell lymphoma 16 has proven to reverse memory deficits in a mouse model with AD 17; therefore, it is 
being repositioned as antiAD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03056495). Dasatinib (tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor) is currently approved for the treatment of lymphoblastic or chronic myeloid leukemia 18; however, 
its effects on neuroinflammation mediated by microglial andor astrocytic responses 19 has led to testing its 
effect in modulating AD progression (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04063124). Polypharamacological 
profiles of drugtargets could be used for drug repurposing, identifying, and validating new targets, and 
finding new bioactive ligands, among other applications.
