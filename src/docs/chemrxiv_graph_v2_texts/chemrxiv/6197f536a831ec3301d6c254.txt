Text:
A vast array of synthetic methods involving nickel catalysis has been developed in recent years.1 
Methods that involve exogeneous reductants often are best accomplished with airstable Ni(II) catalysts,1d,1e 
which are desirable compared with more airsensitive Ni(0) counterparts. While processes involving 
phosphine and pyridine ligand frameworks often perform well with Ni(II) precursors,2 reactions that 
involve Nheterocyclic carbene ligands are more commonly performed with Ni(COD)2 as the precatalyst. This choice is due to inefficiencies in the catalyst reduction and formation of catalytically active Ni(0) 
species.
