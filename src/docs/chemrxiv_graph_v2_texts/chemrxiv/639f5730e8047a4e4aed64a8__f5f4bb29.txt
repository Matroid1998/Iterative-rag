Description:
The primary reduction product of CO2 by molecular catalysts such as metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines.

Text:
Graphene and MoS2 are good candidates for strain 
engineering because they are relatively large (mm) in size. However, strain induction for sub2 
nm materials is challenging due to the mismatch of lateral size with supports and difficulties in 
material transfer. Molecular complexes such as metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are efficient CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts because of their electronic structures and the tunable ligand 
environments surrounding the active sites5. However, these molecules along with most other 
molecular catalysts primarily reduce CO2 to CO; catalysts that selectively reduce CO2 beyond CO 
are scarcely reported6,7. An early study of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) in 19848 showed a 
methanol (MeOH) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 5.

Description:
The prevailing product in studies of CO reduction reactions with CoPc.

Text:
This work did not receive much attention until 
recently when the Wang9 and Robert10 groups separately reported improved FEMeOH with CoPc 
deposited on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In the paper from the Robert group, it 
was emphasized that only small amount of methanol could be obtained from CO2RR, while larger 
amount could be generated from CO reduction reaction (CORR). In stark contrast, the Wang group 
claimed that a FEMeOH as high as 44 could be obtained with CoPc deposited on MWCNT. However, most studies have been unable to obtain the improved FEMeOH observed by the Wang 
group, instead finding CO to be the prevailing product even with monodispersed CoPc1115.
