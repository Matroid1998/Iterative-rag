Description:
Nanocrystals synthesized using the hot injection method, where E can be S, Se, or Te.

Text:
Since Murray et al.1 first synthesized monodisperse CdE (E  S, Se, Te) nanocrystals (NCs)
using the hot injection method in 1993, significant advancements in colloidal chemistry over
the past 30 years have enabled precise control over the size, shape, and monodispersity of
various NC types,25 including metals,6 semiconductors from groups IV,7 IIVI,8 IVVI,9
and perovskites.10,11 As a result, NCs as ideal nanoscale building blocks for bottomup
selfassembly strategies.
