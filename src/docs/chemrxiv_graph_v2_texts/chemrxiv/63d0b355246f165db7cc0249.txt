Description:
A type of base that pairs with purine bases in Watson-Crick base pairing within RNA structures.

While proteins are made mostly of Lamino ac
ids, nucleic acids often contain Dribose sugars.12 Many of the 
hypothesis that address this predominance stems from the the
ories of the origin of life.35 One such hypothesis states that in 
the RNA world, preceding the modern protein world, chiral 
amino acids worked as chaperons for RNA folding and func
tions.68 It is also assumed that in the evolution of amino acid 
and proteinbased biological machinery that succeeded RNA 
world, the interaction of amino acids and RNA motifs could 
also play a role in the above chiral predominance.89 
RNA tetraloop hairpins are a special type of treedimensional 
motifs where the majority of bases in an RNA structure belong 
to the paired regions (Watson  Crick base pairing between pu
rine and pyrimidine bases in a given sequence) forming the 
stem part of RNA while the unpaired region having a specific 
sequence forms the loop part of the RNA.10 The stability, sim
ilarity, structural features and probable interactions between 
different hairpin structures are studied and compared using var
ious experimental techniques such as NMR and various other 
absorption spectroscopic studies.1115 The significant feature of 
these types of motifs involves spontaneous transitions between 
native folded states to form various misfolded and elongated 
singlestranded structures.1619 The role and dynamics of these 
structural motifs in various recognition processes are exten
sively evaluated by various experimental methods for 
understanding various transition states and RNA folding path
ways.10, 2025 The recent FRET experimental studies26 on GAAA 
tetraloop structures show that the kinetics and thermodynamics 
of events associated with foldingunfolding equilibria is highly 
influenced by various complexities of amino acids.2728 The ar
guments based on theories related to chiral amino acidbased 
origin of life are validated to an extent by various studies that 
specify that the energetics and kinetics are altered in the pres
ence of amino acids from the secondary to tertiary level of in
teractions in RNA motifs27.
