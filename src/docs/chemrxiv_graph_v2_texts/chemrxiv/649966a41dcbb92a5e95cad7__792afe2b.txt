has taken centre stage in recent years, 2126 in the hope that greater valence band delocalisation
and bond covalency can improve hole mobility while simultaneously generating enough carriers
to enable degenerate conductivity. One such material is copper iodide, CuI, rst discovered in 1907 by the father of transparent
conductors Karl Bdeker, 27 and now enjoying somewhat of a renaissance. It crystallises in the
cubic zincblende structure below 643 K (Figure 1a), possesses an optical band gap of around 3 eV,
displays native ptype conductivity, and consistently shows one of the highest gures of merit, ,1
for any ptype transparent conductor (over 60 000 M1 for Sdoped CuI).
