Description:
Forms chainlike structures in optical matter.

OM is 
a form of matter in which nanoparticles selforganize through light matter interactions, referred to 
as optical bonds, resulting in periodical arrangements. These optical bonds originate from multiple 
scattering interactions between colloidal particles.19,2225 As a consequence, OMs can be engineered 
and reconfigured onfly by modifying the input light properties (wavelength, polarization, 
intensity profile,).26,27 Many examples of optical matter have been created in the literature, such 
as dumbbellshaped assemblies in gold particles, chainlike structures in silver particles, and 
hexagonal clusters in polystyrene particles.23,29,30 However, detailed information on the structure 
andor their properties is often missing, particularly when the density of particle increases, or the 
size of particle is decreased.
