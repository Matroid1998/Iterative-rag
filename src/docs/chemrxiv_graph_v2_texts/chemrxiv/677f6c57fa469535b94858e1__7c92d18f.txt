Description:
Constitutes 0.3-1 wt% of NdFeB magnets.

Neodymiumironboron permanent magnets, commonly abbreviated as NdFeB magnets consist of an alloy 
mainly made of 6070 wt of Fe, 2030 wt of Nd, and 0.31 wt of B, as well as 0.57 wt of Pr.1 Small 
amounts of other metals such as Al, Ga, Co, Cu, Dy and Tb are added to NdFeB magnets to adjust their 
properties.2 For example, Dy and Tb are typically added to increase the coercivity of a magnet at high 
temperatures.2,3 The addition of up to 5 of Co increases the Curie temperature of the magnet, a 
temperature in which the magnet retains its permanent magnetic properties,4 whereas Ga and Al improve 
the thermal stability of the magnet.5 Therefore, the used NdFeB magnets are not only a potential secondary 
source for rare earth elements (REE) but also for other critical elements such as Co, Al, or Ga.6 
Largersized wind turbine and electric car magnets can be recycled as they are, but smaller magnets 
from electric appliances and hard disk drives (HDDs) must be separated from the other components 
including plastic or metal parts either by manual7,8 or automatic9,10 dismantling.
