Description:
A ligand used in Ru(NN)32 complexes to modify the character of the lowest excited states.

Text:
Further reports from the
Gordon group on Ru(NN)32 complexes with NN
ligands derived from substituted 1,10phenanthroline,
showed that appending aromatic groups to the ligand
changes the character from MLCT to a ligandcentred
triplet (3LC).35
Effectively controlling the character of the lowest ex
cited states of these complexes provides thus a unique op
portunity towards tuning their optical properties, whilst
maintaining (and even increasing) their excitedstate
lifetimesa crucial aspect to optimise if these complexes
are to find applications in photocatalysis. Whilst most studies focus on the linear absorption
and emission properties, the nonlinear optical proper
ties of these complexesin particular their twophoton
absorption (2PA) cross sectionshave not been stud
ied to the same extent. Most complexes showing 2PA
have been derived from twophoton absorbing ligands
