Description:
Interact directly with Mg2 as a hard metal.

Text:
Mg2 is the most abundant divalent cation in the intracellular uid.13 As a hard metal, it
interacts directly with water, carboxylates, phosphates, hydroxyls, and carbonyls present in
proteins, nucleotides, nucleic acids, and lipids.47 It is shown to have metabolic, structural as
well as regulatory functions in many diverse physiological processes.1,3,4,6,810 For example, it
modulates membrane structure, binds to dissolved nucleotides, such as ATP, stabilizes DNA
and RNA structures, and serves as a metal cofactor in various enzymes, including kinases,
