Description:
SMMs with two mutually trans anionic ligands show the largest Ueff from stabilising the largest mJ projections in the ground state.

Text:
Singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) show magnetic remanence,1 and lanthanide (Ln) SMMs 
have provided the largest effective energy barriers to magnetic reversal (Ueff) and hysteresis 
temperatures (TH) to date.24 These advances have been driven by classical electrostatic design 
criteria to increase magnetic anisotropy, where Dy(III) and Tb(III) SMMs with two mutually trans 
anionic ligands show the largest Ueff from stabilising the largest mJ projections in the ground state 
and destabilising the smaller mJ states.57 Perfectly linear (i.e. with a C axis) Dy(III) and Tb(III) 
complexes would have pure mJ states, which would suppress twophonon Raman and quantum 
tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) relaxation processes, giving high TH values. However, any 
deviation from linearity introduces transverse fields that mix the mJ states, reducing TH.

Description:
Ions that interact with anionic cages, promoting magnetic relaxation in SMM properties.

Text:
Given the 
difficulty of isolating linear Ln(III) complexes, we considered that a Dy(III) complex with only a 
single anionic ligand may show purer mJ states than a bent bisanionic complex and hence show 
relatively high TH. Indeed, the theoretical DyO cation has been predicted to have Ueff  2084 
cm1,6 but the isolation of such a coordinatively unsaturated complex is inherently challenging due 
to a combination of large Ln cations and predominantly ionic bonding regimes favouring high 
coordination numbers.8 The closest molecular analogues of DyO are endohedral fullerenes 
containing Dy2O fragments,912 and these compounds show favourable SMM properties, but 
magnetic relaxation is promoted by interactions of Dy(III) ions with the anionic cages.
