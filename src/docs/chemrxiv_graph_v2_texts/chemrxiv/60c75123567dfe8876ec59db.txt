Polymeric biomaterials with significant impact on medical technologies have been extensively studied in the last few 
2 
decades and have been used as artificial organs, wound healing, biomedical packaging, therapeutic agents, drug
3 
delivery, and artificial kidney and hearts 16. In an effort to design and synthesis of polymeric biomaterials, different 
4 
synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, and poly 
5 
(ethylene glycol) have been synthesized and their biocompatibility for using in biomedical application have been 
6 
studied 3, 4, 79. Generally, the biocompatibility (which is defined as an ability of materials to be compatible with 
7 
cells, tissues and etc. )5, 10 of these polymers is an important factor, and is governing the design and synthesis of 
8 
them 11.
