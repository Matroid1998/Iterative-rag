Description:
Can complex with U to significantly increase its Tg and with dimethylurea to decrease its Tg.

However, DEHP has been associated with wildlife, reproductive, 
and development concerns, environmental damage, and carcinogenic effects in animals and 
humans 47. It is imperative that a harmless yet effective plasticizer as an alternative to the phthalates 
be identified, so that wildlife, humans, and the environment and are not subject to the negative 
effects of current PVC plasticizers like DEHP. A review article has summarized recent attempts 
to replace the harmful phthalate plasticizers with a variety of plasticizers, some of which may be 
harmless 8. We recently discovered that atactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) could complex 
with U and significantly increase its Tg, and PMMA could also complex with dimethylurea, 
which decreased its Tg 911.
