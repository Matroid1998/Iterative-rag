Description:
Used in porous electrodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

In other words, the length of 
time needed for a typical GITT experiment essentially pre
cludes its use in operando methods, and hence the cou
pling of operando methods with diffusion coefficient meas
urements. In this work, an efficient and nondisruptive alternative 
to the GITT is proposed the intermittent current interrup
tion (ICI) method. Our group first developed the ICI 
method for characterizing the porous carbon electrodes in 
lithiumsulfur batteries,79 and the method has more re
cently been applied more widely for different battery cell
