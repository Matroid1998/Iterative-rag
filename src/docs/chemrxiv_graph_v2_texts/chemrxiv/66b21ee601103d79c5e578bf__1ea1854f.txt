Description:
Used as carriers for bioactives and to impart near-infrared light responsiveness.

Text:
For instance, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can increase the 
gel conductivity and boost the biochemical activity of conductive tissues, such as the nerve and cardiac, 
for regenerative medicine.4 They can serve as fluorescent probes for sensing.5 Graphene and its 
derivatives have been used as carriers for bioactives,6 and to impart nearinfrared light 
responsiveness.7 Carbon dots can impart luminescence to peptide gels,8 and peptides can modulate 
their fluorescence.9 
In our labs, we have found that the nanocarbon type can have important consequences on peptide self
assembling ability.
