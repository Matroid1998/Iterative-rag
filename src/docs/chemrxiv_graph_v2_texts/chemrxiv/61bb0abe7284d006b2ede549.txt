Description:
A greenhouse gas released from fossil fuel combustion contributing to climate change.

Climate change and its devastating environmental effects constitute the major longterm threats that our 
planet is facing. On the other hand, the depletion of fossil fuel reserves is a big challenge to the energy 
security of our society. It is anticipated that the annual energy consumption will be doubled by 2050 
compared to 2015 1. Relying on fossil fuels may partly solve this issue from an energy supply 
perspective; however, it will further escalate the environmental crisis via enormous CO2 release and 
that of other harmful emissions such as NOx and SOx 2. The use of hydrogen as a carbonfree energy 
carrier is a promising solution, offering a sustainable energy system 3.
