Vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors that can sensitively influence photoelectrochemical properties.

Among those strategies, introduction of defects is a simple 
and efficient way to improve the photocatalytic performance of BiOCl. 5, 10. According to the 
differences in atomic structure, defects can be categorized as point defect, line defects, planar 
defects and volume defects. The relation between these defects and photocatalytic activity may 
be complex and elusive. For instance, oxygen vacancies (OVs) in metal oxide semiconductors, 
considered point defects, can sensitively influence photoelectrochemical properties. Recently, 
the study of surface OVs has emerged as a hot research topic, because most catalytic reactions 
occur on the surface of catalytic materials and a deep understanding of the nature of surface OVs 
is needed to design and prepare highly efficient photocatalysts. For example, Li et al.

Molecular oxygen activation occurs on different crystal planes of BiOCl nanosheets in the presence of surface oxygen vacancies.

reported 
that surface OVs in BiOCl can improve water adsorption and reduce activation energy barriers for 
photocatalytic water oxidation11. Zhao et al. discovered that different pathways of molecular 
oxygen activation are prevailing on (001) and (010) crystal planes of BiOCl nanosheets in the 
presence of surface OVs12. At the same time, the bulk properties of the semiconductor are equally important in 
determining the efficiency of a photoelectrochemical reaction. Separation and migration of 
photogenerated charge carriers first occur in the bulk of the materials. In addition, bulk 
modification, such as doping and defects, remarkably affect light harvesting ability and band
