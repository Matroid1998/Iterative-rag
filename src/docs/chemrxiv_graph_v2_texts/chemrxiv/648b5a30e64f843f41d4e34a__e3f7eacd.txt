Description:
Positions the substrate and stabilizes the transition state in the P loop motif.

Text:
Specifically, the P
loop motif (HCX5R) contains a cysteine nucleophile that initiates the catalytic cycle (Figure 1A), 
as well as a conserved arginine that positions the substrate and stabilizes the transition state. A 
second conserved loop, the WPDloop, undergoes substantial (10 ) conformational transitions 
between catalytically inactive closed and catalytically active open conformations. In doing so, the 
WPDloop optimally positions a key aspartic sidechain (D356 in YopH) in the active site where 
it can act as an acidbase catalyst during the twostep cleavagehydrolysis mechanism common to 
all PTPs. (Zhang, 1998) Other proximal loops such as the Q and Eloops are less conformationally 
mobile but also play important roles in catalysis (Figure 1D, (Crean et al., 2021)).
