Description:
A compound involved in catalytic oxidation to mitigate emissions from industrial and automotive exhaust.

Text:
To mitigate emissions from
industrial and automotive engine exhaust, catalytic oxidation of CO is currently considered
the most energysaving and efficient method to deal with increasing CO emissions.3
Over the past decade, catalytic CO oxidation on singleatom catalysts (SACs) has become
a prominent and increasingly interesting subject of research,46 driven by the distinctive
catalytic properties and high degree of tunability exhibited by SACs, as well as the efficient
utilization of costly noble metals. SACs have given proof to exhibit remarkable catalytic
activity in a broad variety of processes, including CO oxidation,7,8 benzene combustion,9
NO reduction,10 CO2 hydrogenation,11,12 watergas shift13,14 and more.
