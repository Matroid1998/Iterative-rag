Description:
A phthalocyanine Tb(III) complex noted for its significant magnetic anisotropy and large spin ground state.

Text:
The energy barrier further
depends on the total spin of the system and is given by Ueff  S2D and (S214)D
(for integer and noninteger spin states respectively), where D is the axial zero eld splitting
parameter.5 Complexes based on lanthanides (Ln) have gained much popularity as propitious
candidates for SIMs since the report of phthalocyanine Tb(III) complex, TbPc2 in 2003 owing
to huge magnetic anisotropy and large spin ground state.6 Followed by this, a plethora of
Lnbased complexes have been synthesized and characterized with high anisotropic energy
barriers.
