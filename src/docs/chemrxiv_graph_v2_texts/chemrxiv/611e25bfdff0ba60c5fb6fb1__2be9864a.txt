Description:
An early transition metal of high interest as an alternative material for replacing Cu.

Text:
From a more general perspective, it is well known that at the nanoscale, Cu will preferentially 
aggregate into high resistivity 3D island structures.34 One solution to these issues is to replace 
copper with alternative metals that do not suffer from these issues. In this regard, the early 
transition metal Cobalt (Co) is of high interest as alternative material for replacing Cu in next
