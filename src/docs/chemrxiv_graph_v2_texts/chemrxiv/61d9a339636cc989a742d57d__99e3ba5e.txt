Description:
A solid catalyst used in the hydrogenation of carbon oxides to CH4.

catalysts (e.g. NiAl2O3) via the stoichiometric reactions (1) and (2).5

From an economic viewpoint the implementation of decentralized smallscale methanation 
12 
plants in proximity of carbon point sources associated with available renewable energy sources is 
13 
advantageous.2 Such units, however, require minimal upstream buffer capacities to be cost
14 
effective. This consequently leads to a propagation of fluctuations in reactant availability and 
15 
composition into the reactor, which is the case for both H2 and the COCO2 source. Hence, the
