Description:
Mechanically interlocked molecules used in artificial molecular machines and loaded with cytotoxic complexes.

Linking molecules together through noncovalent, mechanical bonds can impart unique physical 
and chemical features to these supramolecular systems that would be difficult, or even impossible, 
to achieve through classic synthetic methodology.1,2 The ability to control the shape and dynamic 
motion of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) by the use of external stimuli has made 
headlines with the construction of artificial molecular machines.36 Functional7 supramolecular 
compounds have also been used in many applications ranging from logic gates or molecular 
switches for electronic devices,8 as molecular nanovalves for controlling drug release from 
nanoporous materials,9 and as catalysts.10,11 
In a biomedical context, supramolecular coordination complexes show promise in several 
applications12,13 from cytotoxic drugs1416 and drug delivery vehicles,1719 through to biosensors 
for DNA recognition,20 and reporter probes for diagnostic molecular imaging.12 For example, 
rotaxanes loaded with cytotoxic Pt14 or Ru16 complexes, and other systems capable of selective 
Ca2 ion binding,15 have displayed antitumour properties against human cancer cells.

Description:
Engineered with sophisticated drug release mechanisms featuring enzyme-mediated disassembly.

Rotaxanes 
have also been engineered with sophisticated drugrelease mechanisms21,22 that feature enzyme
mediated disassembly of a prodrug inside tumour cells via multiple cleavage steps that separate a 
stabilising macrocycle from a cytotoxic drugcapped axle.18 
Relatively few examples exist where supramolecular chemistry was employed in the design 
of molecular imaging agents. Lusby, Archibald and coworkers reported the successful 
radiosynthesis of a supramolecular complex by encapsulating the gray emitting 99mTcTcO4 
pertechnetate anion inside the cavity of a tetrahedral Co(III)4L6metallocage, where L is a 
terpyridinebased ligand, for applications in singlephoton emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) imaging (Figure 1).23 In vivo imaging showed that the 99mTcmetallocage complex had
