Description:
A molecule involved in thermodynamically difficult reactions such as reduction to ammonium.

Text:
They can perform reactions with 
exceptionally high selectivity and specificity, including thermodynamically difficult 
reactions, such as the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonium (nitrogenases) or the 
oxidation of water during photosynthesis.4 Usually, enzymes are designed by nature to 
efficiently catalyse reactions under physiological conditions, however, when confronted 
with unnatural substrates, enzymes often exhibit low activity and selectivity.5 
For this reason, in recent years the synthesis of new artificial metalloenzymes by 
combining metal systems and enzymes has represented a promising line of research. This 
field is expanding not only in terms of its applications, but also in its design. 6 The 
success of such hybrids is based on the advantages offered by the combination of these 
two domains.
