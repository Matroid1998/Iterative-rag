Description:
An isoelectronic analogue of benzene, also known as inorganic benzene.

Text:
B and N are elements in the periodic table adjacent to C. The substitution of each 
two C atoms in benzene by a pair of B and N atoms obtains an isoelectronic analogue 
of benzene. These isoelectronic molecules have the same 6 electrons as benzene, 
suggesting that, according to the Hckels rule, they should all be aromatic. However, 
the fact is not so simple. As early as 1926, Stock et al.4 succeeded in experimentally synthesizing an 
isoelectronic species of benzene, B3N3H6, named borazine and popularly known as 
inorganic benzene, which is formally a product of the complete substitution of the CC 
unit of benzene by BN, as shown in Scheme 1.

Description:
Proposed to be antiaromatic, nonaromatic, and aromatic depending on the method used.

Text:
Inspired by this synthesis experiment, 
extensive research has been conducted on the aromaticity of borazine, but the 
conclusions are inconsistent. For examples, Iwaki and Udagawa5 investigated the effect 
of the introduction of heteroatoms into the benzene on the aromaticity through index of 
deviation from aromaticity (IDA),6 nucleusindependent chemical shift (NICS),7 and 
harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA)8 methods, and the borazine is 
accordingly proposed to be antiaromatic, nonaromatic, and aromatic, respectively; 
Schleyer et al.,9 after calculating the NICS values separated into the NICS() and 
NICS() contributions, stated that the borazine is not aromatic due to the strong polarity 
of BN bond, similar to the conclusion drawn by Jemmis et al.10 through magnetic
