Description:
Carbon nanotubes have high thermal conductivity similar to graphene.

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has a structure similar to graphene and has high thermal 
conductivity, electrical insulation, and chemical stability.1114 It is often used as a filler in 
polymerbased composites to improve thermal conductivity. hBN in the form of nanosheets 
and nanotubes also offers a promising alternative, as they have similar thermal conductivity to 
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene but also have a larger bandgap (46 eV), making them 
suitable for electronic devices that require both electrical insulation and high thermal 
conductivity.13 Previous studies reported that boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) had a high 
aspect ratio and high thermal conductivity ( 200  300 Wm1K1) 15, making them a suitable 
filler.
