Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical reduction reactions for advancing carbon neutrality.

Text:
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) represents a promising approach to advancing 
carbon neutrality in a sustainable manner.1 However, scaling up electrochemical CO2 reduction 
reaction (CO2RR) for practical applications hinges on the development of efficient catalysts.2 In this 
area, transition metalbased catalysts have garnered significant interest due to their tuneable 
electrochemical properties, which align with the reduction potentials required for converting CO2 into 
desirable products.3 Initially, transition metal complexes gained significant attention due to their 
tuneable electronic structures.4 However, recent advancements have shown that transition metal 
nanoparticles exhibit superior catalytic activity, primarily due to their unique intrinsic surface 
properties.5 Interestingly, further research has revealed that the structural architecture of these 
catalysts plays a crucial role in determining their efficacy however controlling such architectures in 
transition metalbased nanoparticles is challenging.
