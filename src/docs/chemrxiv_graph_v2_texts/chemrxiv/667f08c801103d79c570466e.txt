In 1987, the United Nations (UN) released the report, Our Common Future, which defined the 
concept of sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.1 Sustainability 
consists of three aspects economy, society, and environment.2 In turn, sustainable chemistry 
can be evaluated by three metrics renewable percentage, optimum efficiency, and waste 
percentage.3 Catalysts are one of the tools that accommodate these parameters to achieve 
sustainability. Noble metals such as platinum, palladium, iridium, and ruthenium feature desired catalytic 
properties, such as high temperature tolerance and good catalytic activity. For instance, 
Sonogashira coupling,4, 5 SuzukiMiyaura coupling,6, 7 Heck reaction,8, 9 and Stille coupling10, 11 
need palladium as catalysts that result in good yields under various conditions.

Description:
Possesses catalytic capabilities for arylation, allylation, and other cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Iridium and 
ruthenium also possess catalytic capabilities for arylation, allylation, and other crosscoupling 
reactions.12, 13 Obtaining these noble metals catalysts presents a challenge when it comes to 
sustainability and the prices are subject to market fluctuations.14 Noble metals are mostly 
extracted from low grade ores for which a large amount needs to be mined to extract a small
