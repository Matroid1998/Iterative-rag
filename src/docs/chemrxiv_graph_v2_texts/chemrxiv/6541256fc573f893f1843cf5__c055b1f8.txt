Description:
Used as dopants in apatites, affecting color through dd transitions or charge transfer bands.

Text:
The apatite structure can be classed as an A4(MO4)6 framework which 
contains A cations (A1 site) in trigonal metaprisms that are cornerlinked with the tetrahedral 
MO4 units. The remaining A cations (A2 site) and X anions are located within the cavities of 
this framework (Figure 1). The apatite structure shows excellent flexibility for doping on the 
different sites, and such doping strategies can lead to a variety of properties, such as high ionic 
conductivity and luminescence 2325. The use of different dopants can also change the 
colour of apatites. Previously, apatite pigments have been made by doping with transition 
metals, with the colours observed attributed to dd transitions or to charge transfer bands.
