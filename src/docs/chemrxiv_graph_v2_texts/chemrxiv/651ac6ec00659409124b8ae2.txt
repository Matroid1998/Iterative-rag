Description:
A class of Nabased electrode materials studied for Naion batteries.

Text:
Rechargeable Naion batteries are deemed to become a preferred technology for large
scale electrochemical energy storage systems.1 To compete with more mature Liion batteries, 
they must significantly outscore them on several metrics, the most important being materials 
availability and sustainability.2,3 In terms of Nabased electrode materials, three distinct 
classes are currently the most studied. They are transition metal layered oxides, 
hexacyanometallates, and polyanion compounds.4 Phosphate framework materials are 
highly interesting due to their stability, safety, low cost, and structural diversity.5 The latter is 
due to the ability to host many different cations and swap anions in their structure. Many
