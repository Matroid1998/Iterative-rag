Description:
Polyoxometalates that are used in catalytic applications.

This problem could be only partially overcome by using, for example, 
ultrasmall (12 nm) CoO(OH)x nanoparticles that exhibit a larger bandgap and correspondingly better 
transparency in the visible range due to quantum size effects.24 This led us to hypothesize that, in 
contrast to conventional bulk metal oxidebased water oxidation catalysts, a molecularscale catalyst 
might be favorable for preventing the undesired light absorption by the catalyst and enabling also 
more controllable cocatalyst deposition. With this motivation in mind, we turned our attention to 
water oxidation catalysts based on welldefined molecular polyoxometalates (POMs), such as 
Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)210  CoPOM, a tetracobaltdoped polyoxometalate, that have attracted much 
attention with regards to catalytic applications,4044 and have been previously utilized as cocatalysts
