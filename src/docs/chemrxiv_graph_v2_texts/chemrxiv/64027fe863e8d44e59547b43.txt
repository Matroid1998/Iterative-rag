of fluorine atoms is an established tool for modulating the 
physicochemical properties of organic molecules, used widely in the pharmaceutical industry to 
improve selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties of active ingredients.17 New 
methods continue to emerge for the preparation of organofluorine compounds, including both 
catalytic and enantioselective systems.8 The ongoing need by drug discovery programs for 
fluorinecontaining building blocks, makes important the development of reliable, scalable, and 
selective strategies to generate organofluorine chemicals capable of further functionalization.9,10
