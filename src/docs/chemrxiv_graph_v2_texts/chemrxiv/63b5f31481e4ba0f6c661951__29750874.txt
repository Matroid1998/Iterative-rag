Description:
A solvent used in the crystallization process due to poor solubility of the free base.

Text:
of the costly chiral benzylic amine at the later stage 
improved costefficiency as compared to the initial approach.3 Last, the preparation of 
MRTX0902 fumarate 12 from the free base 8 was explored. Due to the poor solubility of 
MRTX0902 free base, the crystallization process required significant amount of solvent (EtOAc)
