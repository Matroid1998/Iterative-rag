Description:
Characterized by the fusion of a lactone with a benzene core.

Text:
The bicyclic 3Hisobenzofuran1one skeleton, 
commonly known as the phthalide scaffold I, is characterized by 
the fusion of a glactone with a benzene core (Figure 1A). A range 
of compounds bearing the phthalide structure are found within 
natural products and are known to have significant and varied 
biological activities.1 For example, nbutyl phthalide is marketed 
as an antiplatelet drug, with the (S)enantiomer more effective 
than its enantiomer.2 Phthalide, and in particular its 3substituted 
derivatives, are also widely recognised as valuable starting 
materials in organic synthesis, and have been particularly used 
for the synthesis of naphthalene and naphthacene natural 
products.1a 3Hydroxyphthalide II reversibly ringopens to 
generate 2formylbenzoic acid, with the cyclised form favoured in 
most solvents.1f A range of 3hydroxyphthalides are natural 
products and possess significant bioactivity.
