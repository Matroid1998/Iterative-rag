Description:
Investigated for applications as LIB anode, offering higher capacity than graphite.

Text:
New chemistries and geometries have opened up new horizons in 
energy storage. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been investigated for 
applications as LIB anode, where they offer a higher capacity than graphite.6 TMDs 
have a generalized formula of MX2, where M is a metal from groups 410, i.e., M  Ti, 
V, Nb, Mo, W, and X is a chalcogen XS, Se, Te.7 Semiconducting 2H MoS2 is active 
in a 30.01 V vs LiLi electrochemical window, where energy storage takes place via 
ion intercalation and conversion processes delivering a joint theoretical capacity of 
669 mA h g1 (Equations 24).6 However, experimentally and under suitable 
nanostructuring, the capacity can be higher.
