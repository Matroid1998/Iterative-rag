Description:
An organic semiconductor with a conjugated system that provides high electrical conductance.

Some 
of 
the 
most 
successful 
organic 
semiconductors are simple PBHs, such as anthracene,5 
pentacene,6 and rubrene.7 Their conjugated systems 
give them high electrical conductance,7 while their rigid 
molecular structure allows for close packing, enhancing 
charge mobility.810 Furthermore, their electronic and 
physical characteristics, such as band gap and solubility, 
can be adjusted by modifying functional groups or 
altering the pattern of ring fusion, i.e., in a linear or 
angular fashion.2,11,12 
The functionality of PBHs in these various devices 
depends on their properties in both the ground (S0) and 
excited (specifically, the first excited singlet (S1) and 
triplet (T1)) states.
