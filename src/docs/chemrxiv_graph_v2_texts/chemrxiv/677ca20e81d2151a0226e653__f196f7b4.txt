Description:
Used in films for uremic toxin adsorption due to its low-fouling characteristics and capability to bind with uremic toxins.

Text:
Selected uremic toxins, mostly 
32 
proteinbound, have been studied for adsorption to surfaces of different types but usually from 
33 
the point of view of adsorbing the uremic toxin to clear it from blood rather than their effect on 
34 
plasma proteinsurface interactions 2,3.Hemodialysis allows for some uremic toxins to be 
35 
cleared from the blood compartment and is universally used to treat those with kidney failure 6 
36 
despite deplorable morbidity and mortality issues. Porous matrix development for the application 
37 
to clearing toxins from blood has largely focused upon toxin adsorption, like our work on uremic 
38 
toxinladen plasma adsorption to 2(methacryloyloxy)ethylphosphorylcholinecocyclodextrin 
39 
(p(MPCcoPMCD)) films, leveraging MPCs inherent lowfouling characteristics and CDs 
40 
capability to bind with uremic toxins 7,8.
