oPhenylenes are simple class of aromatic foldamers.1820 An example of a perfectly folded
ophenylene heptamer, oP7, is shown in Figure 1. The helix has three repeat units per turn,
stabilizing the folded conformer through arenearene interactions between every third repeat
unit. oPhenylenes are conformationally dynamic and their geometries can be studied in
detail by NMR spectroscopy, making them wellsuited to studying problems in molecular
folding. In recent work, we have demonstrated the coassembly of ophenylenes and rodshaped
linkers into macrocycles comprising multiple foldamer subunits as simple examples of folded
systems with higherorder structure.21,22 However, there is essentially no stereocontrol in
these systems the product macrocycles comprise both twist senses of the foldamers (M and
P) in statistical ratios.
