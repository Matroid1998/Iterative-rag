Description:
Formed in situ through deprotonation of the corresponding ketenimine or elimination and subsequent deprotonation from an enaminate.

Text:
For example, Masson reported 
the insitu formation of the lithiated silylketenimine A 
through deprotonation of the corresponding ketenimine or 
elimination and subsequent deprotonation from an 
enaminate, but no spectroscopic data was provided.17 
Keteniminyl complexes with other metals have been 
reported,18,19,20,21,22,23 but with limited applications in 
synthesis. Metal 
ynamides 
represent 
the 
metallo 
tautomers of metal keteniminyls, in which the metal is 
bound to the nitrogen instead of the carbon end.
