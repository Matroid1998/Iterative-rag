Description:
Activated compounds that participate in the Gewald reaction with mercaptoketones or aldehydes.

Text:
First reported 
in 1962,811 the Gewald reaction has been used productively since and has four distinct iterations, each 
offering unique advantages.6, 1215 These iterations include (i) the condensation of mercaptoketones or 
aldehydes with activated acetonitriles, in the presence of a basic catalyst like triethylamine or piperidine 
in ethanol, N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF), dioxane or water at 50 C; (ii) a onepot multicomponent 
reaction of carbonyl compounds with activated acetonitriles and elemental sulfur in the presence of 
amines such as diethylamine, morpholine, or triethylamine.
