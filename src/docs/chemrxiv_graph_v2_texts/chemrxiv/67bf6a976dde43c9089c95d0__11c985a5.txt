Climate change is an escalating global issue, visibly affecting ecosystems and human societies.1 
Balancing environmental protection with industrial and technological growth now becomes the 
key challenge.2,3 Among mitigation strategies, the capture and utilization of greenhouse gases,4,5 
particularly the conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals via hydrogenation, has attracted 
substantial attention.6 Yet, the practical application of CO2 as chemical feedstock is complicated 
by its inherent chemical stability and the lack of effective catalysts optimized at atomic and 
nanoscale levels.7,8 Indeed, the complexity of the catalytic reaction network for CO2 
hydrogenation8 into C2 oxygenates and hydrocarbons significantly exceeds the notorious 
complexity of the CO hydrogenation reaction.911 Experimental observations suggest the existence 
of numerous intermediates on the surface of transition metal catalysts in this process, including 
CO, CHO, HCOO, COOH, and CHx.1216 
Although the modeling of catalytic reaction networks is incredibly helpful for understanding key 
factors driving various chemical reactions, the construction and analysis of microkinetic models 
covering reaction networks for CO2 and CO hydrogenation is greatly complicated by hundreds of 
the involved intermediates.9,11,1721 In particular, the complexity of these models serves as the 
bottleneck for the rational design of new catalysts2225 through identifying key intermediates and 
constructing Sabatier volcano plots.2629 Moreover, realistic modeling of chemical processes needs 
to account for the nanostructure of the applied catalysts 30,31 to minimize the gap between the 
computational predictions and the experimental observations.
