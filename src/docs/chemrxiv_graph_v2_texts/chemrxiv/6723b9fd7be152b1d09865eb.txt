Description:
A component of nucleic acids that is prone to organize into non-canonical structures known as G-quadruplexes, which participate in crucial biological processes.

Guanine(G)rich nucleic acids (NAs) are present in 
important regions of the human genome, like the 
telomeres at the end of the chromosomes and the 
promoter regions of several oncogenes.13 These 
sequences are highly prone to organize into non
canonical NAs structures, known as Gquadruplexes 
(G4s), well recognized to actively participate in crucial 
biological processes essential for cell replication and 
survival.2, 4 Consequently, G4s have become a topic 
of interest as potential targets for the development of 
new therapeutic approaches. In cancer context, the 
human telomere, characterized by a singlestranded 
overhang at the 3end consisting prevalently of 
repeats of the GGGTTA sequence, assumes critical 
significance.
