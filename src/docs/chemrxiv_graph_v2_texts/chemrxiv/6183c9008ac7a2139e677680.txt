Description:
A two-dimensional material that is chemically inert and requires high energy for covalent functionalization.

Text:
Functionalization of twodimensional (2D) materials, such as 
graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, is an important 
feature to tune the physical properties of 2D materials, from 
stability to processability, with the aim of improving their 
properties. The most common way to successfully functionalize 
a 2D material is arguably through reactions occurring in 
solution.1,2 However, as typical 2D materials are very inert 
compounds from a chemical point of view, the covalent 
functionalization process requires a lot of energy. Therefore, it 
is normally an uncontrolled step, thus causing defects, low 
degree of functionalization and attachment of molecules in 
random positions. Noncovalent functionalization is also an 
alternative approach, but it typically lacks longrange order, 
thus resulting in a material more similar to a composite.

Description:
A material that can be derived from fluorographene through nucleophilic substitution with a high degree of conversion.

Text:
To overcome this problem, the use of functionalized 
precursors can be an appropriate solution.8 For this reason, 
fluorographene (FG), a perfluorinated hydrocarbon, took 
interest in the community due to its reactivity and the 
possibility to form several graphene derivatives through 
nucleophilic substitution with high degree of conversion.9 
In this context, coordination chemistry, and reticular design 
in particular, has given rise to a new route for the 
functionalization of 2D materials thanks to its greater chemical 
versatility and tunability, yielding to higher degrees of 
functionalization, if compared with those achieved in purely 
inorganic materials.10 Thus, the interest in finding 2D molecular 
analogues has increased, as they can be chemically tuned by the 
proper chemical design.11 The molecular nature of layered 
coordination 
polymers 
(LCPs) 
permits, 
a 
priori, 
the 
incorporation of different functionalization onto the 2D 
molecular material.
