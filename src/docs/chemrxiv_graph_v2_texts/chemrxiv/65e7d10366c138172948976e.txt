The most familiar NMR methods have focused on nuclear spin   (I12) systems, such as 1H 
31 
and 13C; however, a majority of NMRactive isotopes are quadrupolar, with I  , which can yield 
32 
exquisite details about the interaction between the nuclear spin and its surrounding ground state 
33 
electron density produced by the EFGs715. Even with the revolutionary demonstration of new 
34 
NMR pulsesequence methods for quadrupolar species in the 1990s (resulting in highly resolved 
35 
spectra)16, quadrupolar SSNMR is still often plagued by complicated lineshapes that can overlap 
36 
and become difficult to elucidate for structural features.
