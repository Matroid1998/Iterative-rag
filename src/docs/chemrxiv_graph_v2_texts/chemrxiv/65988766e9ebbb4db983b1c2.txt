Description:
A material with dramatically increased conduction band degeneracy, yielding a significantly improved Seebeck coefficient.

Text:
of Scd orbitals dramatically increases conduction band degeneracy in 
Sc2Si2Te6, yielding a significantly improved Seebeck coefficient relative to Sb2Si2Te6. As a result, Sc2Si2Te6 is predicted to achieve an extraordinary dimensionless figure of 
merit (ZT) of 3.51 at 1000 K, which significantly surpasses the predicted maximum ZT 
of 2.76 for Sb2Si2Te6 at 900 K. This work suggests that engineering band degeneracy 
through compositional variation is an effective strategy for improving the 
thermoelectric performance of layered materials. Keywords layered thermoelectric materials, band degeneracy, enhanced Seebeck 
coefficient, firstprinciples calculation, momentum relaxation time approximation
