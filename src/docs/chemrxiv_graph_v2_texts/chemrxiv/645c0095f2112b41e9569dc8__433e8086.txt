Description:
Compounds developed for catalytic applications.

Using this strategy, the concentration of NAD as well as the 
NADNADH ratio could be altered, potentially interfering with numerous processes highly controlled in cancer 
cells, such as energy regulation, DNA repair and transcription, or immunological functions5, 6. The catalytic 
cycle was also studied, showing similar behaviour to complex CpRh(bipy)Cl. Thus, a number of Ru(II)
arene compounds were further developed7. Afterwards, a series of neutral Ru(II) halfsandwich complexes, 
whereby the choice of the arene and of the chelating ligand has a major effect on the catalytic activity, were 
shown to regioselectively catalyse the TH of NAD 811, and to be able to perform the reaction in cellular 
environment12.
