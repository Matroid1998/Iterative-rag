Description:
A new ionic compound synthesized from butyl methylimida zolium methylcarbonate and resorcinol.

Text:
Since both resorcinol and RF particles exhibit protic sites
(aromatic hydroxyl groups), we therefore propose to use
this methodology to pre or postfunctionalize RF resins. The prefunctionalization consists first in the synthesis of
the new ionic compound butylmethylimidazolium resorci
nate C1C4ImRes from commercial butyl methylimida
zolium methylcarbonate C1C4ImMeOCO2 and resorci
nol, and then use it as precursor for the polycondensation
with formaldehyde to obtain C1C4ImRF (Fig. 1, a). The
post functionalization of RF consists in the direct reaction
of C1C4ImMeOCO2 with the RFs to obtain C1C4ImRF
(Fig. 1, b). Figure
