Description:
A complex mixture with more than 240,000 molecular species, much of which is structurally unknown.

Text:
The molecular distribution typically 
40 
ranges from 16 to 1000 amu.4 The number of unique compounds is extensive and more than 
41 
240 000 molecular species have been resolved in a single sample.5,6 Due to this complexity, a 
42 
large portion of the petroleum chemical space is structurally unknown. 43 
We have previously looked at the resins fraction (i.e. larger heteroatomcontaining species) of 
44 
North Sea oils.7 Herein, we extend our work with a focus on aromatics. Within this fraction, 
45 
the dominant species (in terms of abundance) are monoaromatic followed by a smaller 
46 
amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).8,9 The PAHs class is dominated by 
47 
smaller (2 to 3 rings) PAHs, with larger species (e.g. chrysene, coronene) being present at 
48 
trace levels.

Description:
Analyzed using prefractionation with silica chromatography or SPE cartridges.

Text:
Traditionally, petroleum analysis is based on prefractionation using silica 
58 
chromatography or solidphase extraction (SPE) cartridges followed by GCMSn.2023 SPE is 
59 
a lowefficiency separation technique, depending on chemical selectivity. This allows crude 
60 
isolation of the aromatics fraction, but not separation of the compounds within it. Thus, an 
61 
aromatic fraction obtained by SPE contains both the benzenes, naphthalenes and larger rings. 62 
Here, a typical crude oil will have a high abundance of monoaromatics, with diminishing 
63 
concentrations with increasing ring size. The appropriate GC oncolumn concentration of the 
64 
naphthalenes typically results in the larger ring systems being below the limit of detection 
65 
(LOD).
