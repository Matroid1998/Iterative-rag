computationally designed systems demonstrating strong 
halogen bonding which included motifs using fluorine 
atoms and bicyclic diamine derivatives (Figure 1d)20. Collectively, these findings indicate the possibility that 
fluorinecentred halogen bonding can occur under specific 
conditions21. Given this under explored potential, their
