Description:
A component whose removal during charging causes contraction in the TMO bond length.

This has
presented as an increase in nickel content to the current NMC811 cathode, which exhibits a
specic capacity of 190  220 mAh.g1.2
Initial observations of NMC811 by Xray diraction show an expansion in the clattice param
eter followed by a drastic reduction shortly after 4.1 V vs LiLi, often termed the lattice
collapse.2,3 Upwards of 4.1 V, delithiation is signicant enough to reduce the interlayer spacing
between TMoxygen layers to less than that of a fully lithiated lattice.2,4 The evolution in the
a and clattice parameters coincides with a total unit cell volumetric reduction; during charg
ing, the removal of lithium causes a contraction in the TMO bond length from 2.87 to 2.81
, manifesting in a shrinkage of the alattice parameter.

Description:
Intercalates into structures, causing stress on the lattice and contributing to electrochemically mediated crack formation.

Text:
This has been reported to be due to
charge compensation where Ni(II) oxidises to Ni(IV) and thus has a greater covalent attraction
to its surrounding oxygen atoms.2 It is believed that this collapse then requires an additional
energetic contribution to intercalate lithium back into the structure, consequently increasing
the stress on the lattice.5 These extensive volume uctuations have been suggested as an origin
for electrochemically mediated crack formation.6
Cracking in secondary particles has been proposed to cause reduced performance due to insuf
cient connection between particles and the conductive architecture in the electrode matrix,7
as well as fresh surface exposure to electrolyte and subsequent oxygen release accompanied by
electrolyte oxidation.8 It has been determined that the signicant expansion and contraction of
the clattice parameter during cycling will induce strains on the cathode secondary particles,
resulting in the possible development of microcracks.9 As suggested above, the considerable
changes in lattice parameters are likely to be a cause of cracking and can advance degradation
severely especially during fast charge cycles that sees substantial changes in crystallographic pa
