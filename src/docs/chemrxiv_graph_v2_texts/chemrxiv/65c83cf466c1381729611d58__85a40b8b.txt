ing functional groups onto the carbon fiber surface. The result
ing plasmatreated carbon cloth (pCC) exhibits significantly 
enhanced affinity with methanol (MeOH) solvent and chemi
cals. Subsequently, pCC is immersed in a Zn(NO3)2MeOH 
solution and then transferred into a 2MeImMeOH solution, 
allowing ZIF8 particles to grow onto the carbon fiber tightly 
and uniformaly, thereby forming pZIFCC. The obtained p
ZIFCC undergoes sintering in a nitrogen atmosphere, resulting 
in the formation of pZNCC. Figure 1. The schematic diagram of the synthetic process of p
ZNCC. Figure 2 illustrates the role of plasma in the synthesis of uniform 
and tight adhered ZIF8 layer on the carbon fiber.
