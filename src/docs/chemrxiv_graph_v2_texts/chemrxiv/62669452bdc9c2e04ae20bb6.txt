Description:
Can be sequestered by short chain cyclophosphates like trimetaphosphate.

Gosselin and 
84 
Coghlan (1953) found that polyphosphates were equally effective at sequestering 
85 
calcium at relative phosphorous concentrations of 1, 12, and 65 for TripolyP, 
86 
HexametaP, and TrimetaP, respectively. The dissociation constants of calcium (pKD  
87 
3.56 vs 6.5) are lower with TrimetaP than TripolyP (Van Wazer  Callis, 1958). Short
88 
chain cyclophosphates (e.g. trimetaphosphate) can also be effective for sequestering 
89 
iron 9 but increased chain length (e.g. hexametaphosphate) greatly increases calcium 
90 
complexation. McGaughey (10 showed that trimetaphosphate was least effective at 
91 
preventing calcium precipitation compared to tripolyphosphate or hexametaphosphate 
92 
and it inhibited the dissolution of hydroxyapatite, whereas the other two polyphosphates 
93 
solubilized the mineral. This may be due to steric constraints characteristic of
