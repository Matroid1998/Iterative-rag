Description:
The yield strength on the nanoscale may be much higher than for bulk lithium.

Text:
Insufficient Li flux away from the filled crack during cycling leads to a buildup of hydrostatic pressure which
then exceeds the fracture toughness of the ceramic and cracks it open11,14. In order for this model to work,
the crack needs to be completely filled to allow for the necessary pressure buildup. The exact mechanism
of the fracture is still not fully answered and there are open questions such as whether the electrolyte
cracks open first, creating more space for lithium metal to fill and allowing the dendrite to continue, or if
the growing dendrite ruptures the electrolyte as it progresses11,1517. One argument for the latter is that
the yield strength of lithium metal on the nanoscale may be much higher than for bulk lithium14,18.
