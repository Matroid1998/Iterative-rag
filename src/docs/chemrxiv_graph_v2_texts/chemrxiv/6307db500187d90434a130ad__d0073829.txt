Description:
Investigated in dichloro derivatives for solid state organic phosphorescence applications.

Text:
Solid state organic phosphorescence can be exploited to achieve high quantum efficien
cies and ultralong emission lifetimes allowing for applications in organic lightemitting
diodes (OLEDs), anticounterfeiting, photovoltaic cells, solid state lasers and molecular
sensing.13 However, the design of phosphorescence metalfree organic materials is chal
lenging because of the small spinorbit coupling (SOC) which limits the efficiency of in
tersystem crossing (ISC).4 Different strategies can be implemented to enhance SOCs in
metalfree organic molecules including crystal engineering, halogenation (heavy atom ef
fect) and incorporation of carbonyl groups (ntransitions, El Sayed rule).5
