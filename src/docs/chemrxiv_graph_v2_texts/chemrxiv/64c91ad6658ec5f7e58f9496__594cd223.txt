Molecules with a kinetic diameter of 4.3 Ã… whose diffusion is kinetically hindered at 273 K in ZIF glasses.

sod or lta) do not melt on 
their own, but can be flux melted in the liquid of a meltable ZIF.14,16,17 The most critical 
issue, however, is that the gasaccessible porosity of the known meltquenched ZIF 
glasses is rather low and ranges between 14 and 16 of the bulk glass volume.18 
Moreover, the pores of the ZIF glasses are very narrow, so that N2 molecules (kinetic 
diameter 3.6 ) do not enter the intrinsic pore network of the glasses at 77 K, whereas 
the diffusion of the larger nbutane (kinetic diameter 4.3 ) is kinetically hindered at 
273 K, resulting in very low gas uptakes and strongly hysteretic sorption behaviour.11 
This greatly limits their application in gas adsorption and separation, guest molecule 
loading and transport, so that the development of MOF glasses, especially melt
quenched MOF glasses with high porosity, remains an important task.
