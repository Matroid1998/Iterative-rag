Description:
A historically important antimalarial compound.

Text:
Given the importance of the charge transfer (CT) process in influencing key photophysical parameters 
developing structureactivity relationships (SARs) to describe CT formation will be of interest to a wide 
range of stakeholders. In medicinal chemistry the development of SARs is standard practice, but a 
similarly detailed understanding of the structural properties controlling charge transfer has yet to be 
fully developed. Since protonation and Nalkylation have a significant and predictable effect on CT 
states in quinolinecontaining compounds these provide a good starting point for exploring these vital 
fundamental processes and developing effective SARs. One prominent set of quinoline containing compounds are the cinchona alkaloids, in particular the 
historically important antimalarial quinine.

Description:
Relatively inflexible due to its isolation from a natural source.

Text:
However, both the chromophore and overall architecture 
of quinine is relatively inflexible due to its isolation from a natural source, limiting the application of 
such species in the development of SARs. Further, while methods for the synthesis of cinchona 
alkaloids exist,7, 8 they are often insufficiently modular to permit significant structural variation. We 
therefore considered whether structural analogues of quinine might demonstrate similar PL 
properties while being accessible via a more modular synthetic strategy. This would provide easy 
access to families of compounds possessing both variable chromophores and intramolecular 
distances, thus enabling the unpacking of the fundamental processes of throughspace charge transfer
