Description:
A component of the microbial enzyme 3-ketosteroid 1-dehydrogenase involved in steroid degradation.

Text:
One of such important modification is the 
48 
introduction of a double bond between the atoms C1 and C2 of ring A, socalled 1
49 
dehydrogenation, which increases the potency and selectivity of steroid drugs. For example, the 
50 
oxidation of hydrocortisone to prednisolone results in increased antiinflammatory activity 
51 
while reducing saltretaining activity4,5. 1Dehydrogenation, which starts the central 
52 
degradation pathway in bacteria (the opening of ring A leading to the complete mineralization 
53 
of the steroids), is catalysed by a microbial flavin enzyme, 3ketosteroid 1dehydrogenase 
54 
(KstD, EC 1.3.99.4). The genes encoding KstDs, characterized by a rather high sequence 
55 
diversity, are abundant among various bacteria and fungi6.
