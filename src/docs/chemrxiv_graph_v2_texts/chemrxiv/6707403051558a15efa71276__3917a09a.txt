Description:
A compound in which the anomeric position of D-glucose is deoxygenated and acts as a good organogelator.

These compounds with such a restrained threedimensional molecular mobility improve the 
45 
intermolecular packing ability and facilitate the formation of threedimensional supramolecular 
46 
structures, i.e., selfassembled fibrous structures. 47 
Previously, we have developed LMGs in which linear saturated fatty acids are introduced into the 
48 
hydroxy groups of a sixmembered ring cyclic polyol. We have found that 1,5anhydroDglucitol 
49 
(1,5AG), one of the sixmembered ring cyclic polyols and a compound in which the anomeric 
50 
position of Dglucose is deoxygenated, is a good organogelator when linear saturated fatty acids are
