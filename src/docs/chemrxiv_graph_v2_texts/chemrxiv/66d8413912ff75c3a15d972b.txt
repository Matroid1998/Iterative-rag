Description:
Materials systems with limited atomic layer deposition processes due to lack of carbon precursors.

Text:
The best approach to deposit conformal films is often by 
atomic layer deposition (ALD). Since ALD uses selfterminating surface chemical reactions,6,7 
an ALD process will be highly conformal if given enough time for the surface reactions to 
saturate all surfaces.8,9 However, ALD processes are not available for all materials. Carbides 
are one example of materials systems where only a few ALD processes have been reported due 
to the lack of carbon precursors rendering selfterminating surface chemistry.10,11 If the surface 
chemistry is not selfterminating, the deposition is instead referred to as chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD).
