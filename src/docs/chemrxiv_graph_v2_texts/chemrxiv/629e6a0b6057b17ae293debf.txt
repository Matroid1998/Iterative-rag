Description:
A proton transfers as H3O via molecular diffusion in the vehicle mechanism.

Text:
This serious proton conductivity dependence on RH is explained by the inevitable characteristic of the 
conventional proton conduction mechanisms the vehicle mechanism and the structural diffusion.9, 10 In the 
vehicle mechanism, a proton transfers as H3O via molecular diffusion. Structural diffusion is typically regarded 
to be the same as the wellknown the Grotthus mechanism. The structural diffusion involves necessary 
coordination constructed by the following two procedures hopping, in which a proton hops from a proton
