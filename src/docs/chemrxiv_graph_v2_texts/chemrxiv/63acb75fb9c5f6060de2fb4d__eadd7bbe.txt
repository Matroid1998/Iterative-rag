Description:
Materials with structural and chemical diversity that can be tuned for macroscopic material behavior.

Text:
Conceptually, the 
use of molecular A and Xsite species enhances the structural and chemical diversity in these 
perovskites, leading to new opportunities for tuning macroscopic material behaviour.6 Examples 
are tiltandshift engineering to impart ferroelectric properties,7, 8 tunability of hydrogen bonding 
interactions9 between the Asite cation and the 3D BX3 network with ramifications on the 
mechanical response,10, 11 adjustable phase transition thermodynamics,12, 13 and varying 
structural complexities14 amongst others.

Description:
Materials whose mechanical properties can be tailored based on chemical and physical principles.

Some studies24, 25 have reported trends 
such as a relationship between size and chemistry of the divalent Bsite metal and the bulk 
modulus, which agree with chemical intuition. Furthermore, the impact of Bsite metal defects 
has been studied by comparing C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 with its defective analogue 
C(NH2)3Fe2313(HCOO)3, (  vacancy), which exhibits a bulk modulus that is nearly 30 
lower.26 This body of work demonstrates the immense potential for tailoring the mechanical 
properties in hybrid and molecular perovskites, depending on a solid understanding of the 
chemical and physical principles that affect them.
