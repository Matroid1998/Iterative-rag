Description:
A class of reagents in organic synthesis derived from amino acids.

Text:
Amino acids derived diazoketones (AADDKs) are an im
portant class of reagents in organic synthesis.1,2 Using natu
ral proteinogenic amino acids as starting material enables 
easy access to chiral AADDKs. Therefore, these reagents 
could be considered as part of a chiral pool.3,4 Recently, a 
number of preparative methods for the synthesis of Med
Chemrelevant compounds based on AADDK reagents have 
been developed.5 In particular, preparations of chiral 
amino acids,6 azetidin3ones,7,8 lactams,9,10 oxazinones,11 
dihydropyridones,12 Nprotected aminoglyoxals and he
tarylaminomethyl derivatives13 are worth mentioning 
(Figure 1, A).
