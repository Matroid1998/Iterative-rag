Description:
A radical produced during aqueous radiolysis.

Text:
The concentration and type of extractants and 
65 
complexants, as well as the pH, temperature, the choice of solvents, and the target ions are the 
66 
primary variables used to control extraction.23 Kinetics (diffusive or molecular) can also enhance the 
67 
fractionation of ions.24 Here, we introduce another variable and demonstrate that the equilibrium ion 
68 
distribution can be altered by exposing the bulk liquid to Xrays, thereby producing a controllable 
69 
and reversible transport of ions between bulk liquid and a liquidvapor interface. It is known that 
70 
aqueous radiolysis produces H and OH radicals, as well as hydrated electrons that react with a wide
