Description:
A derivative used in stereoselective synthesis.

Text:
of tryp
tamine derivatives proceeds by avoiding the methyl ester, allow
ing the stereoselective introduction of tryptamine derivatives. The plausible biosynthetic pathway of pyrrovobasine (1) is 
shown in Figure 1B. After removal of the alcohol moiety of vo
basinol (2), the C2 position of the tryptamine derivative 4 with

Plausible biosynthetic pathway of pyrrovobasine (1). the pyrraline structure is linked to the activated vobasinol deriv
ative 3 to form pyrrovobasine (1). It is known that sugar deriva
tives such as hexose react with amine residues of amino acids 
and proteins by Maillardtype reactions.4
