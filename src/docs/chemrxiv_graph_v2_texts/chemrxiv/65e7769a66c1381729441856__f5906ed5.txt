Description:
A gas that can be captured and concentrated using electrochemical methods.

Text:
Electrochemical methods for CO2 capture and concentration have emerged as potentially safer, energy 
efficient, modular and scalable alternative to traditional thermochemical methods which tend to be 
energyintensive, and frequently use toxic, and corrosive chemicals such as amines, and hydroxides.

Description:
Captured through electrochemical modulation of proton concentration or electrochemically mediated amine regeneration.

Unlike thermochemical methods, electrochemical methods can be done isothermally, which avoids 
the energy penalty associated with temperature changes.14 Most electrochemical capture methods 
are based on redox reactions, that capture CO2 either through electrochemical modulation of proton 
concentration (pH swing),5,6 electrochemical generation of nucleophiles by reducing redoxactive 
organic molecules,79 or electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (EMAR).1012 The current 
challenges with redoxbased techniques revolve around oxygen sensitivity, high materials cost, cycle 
stability, and energy losses due the overpotentials associated with the redox process.13 The presence 
of oxygen significantly lowers the coulombicenergy efficiencies either by deactivating the redox 
active compound or by directly participating in redox reactions.
