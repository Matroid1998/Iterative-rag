Description:
A molecule studied for its modeling using ML potentials.

It is therefore crucial that ML models ob
tain good accuracies on both intra and interscales. Numerous studies have demonstrated ML potentials
for water and aqueous solutions 2933, methane 26,
ionic liquids 28 and, more recently, electrolyte solu
tions 3436. The standard approach to modelling
these molecular systems is to create separate force
fields for the intra and inter contributions 2, 3739. This approach is inspired by classical force fields and
neatly solves the problem of scale separation. How
ever the approximation breaks down in reactive sys
tems where the molecular identity changes during the
course of the simulation.
