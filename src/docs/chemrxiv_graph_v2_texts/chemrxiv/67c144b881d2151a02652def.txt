Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes have emerged as versatile
agents in photophysics and sensing applications. They have tun
able emission profiles, high quantum yields, and possess mul
tiple spectroscopic advantages.1 They have found their use as
laser dyes, biomolecular labels, and fluorescent switches, to
name a few of their many applications.2,3 There are contin
ued efforts to tailor the properties of BODIPY dyes, with syn
thetic chemists pursuing new systems that exhibit improved
photophysical properties. In particular, solvatochromic BOD
IPY dyes have garnered significant interest. This is largely at
tributed to their ability in exhibiting exceptional sensitivity to
both macro and microenvironmental polarity. This phenomenon
described as solvatofluorochromism,4 has enabled their applica
tion in polarity mapping,5,6 probing cellular processes,7 devel
