Description:
A heavy metal with high atomic weight and density, used in batteries and alloys.

Text:
Heavy metals are natural elements that have high atomic weight and a density at least five times greater 
than that of water. Some examples of heavy metals are mercury (Hg), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), lead 
(Pb), arsenic (As), etc. Heavy metals have multiple industrial, domestic, medical, and technological 
applications, such as in batteries, paints, pesticides, fertilizers, cosmetics, drugs, and alloys1. However, 
their widespread use and disposal have also led to their accumulation and contamination in the 
environment, especially in soil, water, and food sources2. Heavy metal contamination poses a serious 
threat to human health and the ecosystem, as heavy metals are nonbiodegradable and highly toxic at 
certain levels.
