Description:
Used for base metal extraction in leach solutions.

Text:
Since the success of the leaching stage depends on the choice of the leach solution and leach 
conditions, investigations to develop new leach solutions and optimization of leach parameters 
is being undertaken. Leach solutions employed for Cu recovery include acids, bases, salts, and 
ionic liquids. Typical acids used for base metal extraction are sulfuric acid 10, nitric acid 11, 
hydrochloric acid 12, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 11, and mixtures of acids 13. These 
acids have often been used in combination with oxidants such as oxygen, H2O2, ferric salts, and 
chlorine gas 14, 15.

Description:
An efficient solvent for the recovery of Cu.

Text:
Of these leaching agents, sulfuric acid is the favoured solvent 
predominantly because its market price is lower than the other acids and it has been proven to 
be an efficient solvent, especially for the recovery of Cu 16. Ammoniacal mixtures and NaOH 
are examples of basic leaching agents for Cu recovery. The ammoniacal lixiviant is generally 
comprised of ammonia in combination with ammonium salts such as carbonates 17, chlorides 
18, or sulfates 19. The ammonia leaching process is more suitable for Cu extraction than 
acidic systems as these lixiviants show higher selectivity for Cu, leaving metals such as iron 
(Fe) and aluminium (Al) undissolved. However, it has been shown that nickel (Ni) and zinc 
(Zn) are also dissolved in the ammoniabased lixiviant. Most metals present in PCBs are
