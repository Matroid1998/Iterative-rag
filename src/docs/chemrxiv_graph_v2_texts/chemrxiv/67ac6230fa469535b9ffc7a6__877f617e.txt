Description:
Can react efficiently with aqueous electrons, leading to cleavage of the carbamate group.

The 
picolinium can react efficiently with aqueous electrons, leading to cleavage of the 
carbamate group and release of MMAE. Tumourbearing mice that received the ADC and 
radiotherapy showed efficient drug release at the irradiated site, indicating high precision 
local control of drug release. Although radiation induced drug release shows high potential 
for combination therapy, reported useful reactions are rare. One reason could be that the 
radiationinduced radical species are all highly reactive and shortlived, making it difficult 
to predict possible products and study reaction mechanisms.11 
Kinetic models have been extensively used in predicting shortlived species (e.g. singlet 
oxygen12, superoxide radical13 and hydroxyl radical14) mediated advanced oxidation 
processes.
