Description:
A structural component found in only five natural MIAs out of 3,000.

Text:
To the best of our knowledge, this renders 2 one of only five natural MIAs (out of 3,000) to 
contain a cyclopropane.6 From a synthetic perspective, its unique 656635 hexacyclic ring system presents challenges not 
readily addressed via existing approaches to the sarpagine alkaloids. In addition, preliminary biological testing has shown 
rauvomine B (2) to be among the most active of its congeners in antiinflammatory screens, displaying inhibition of RAW 
264.7 macrophages (IC50  39.6 M; positive control, celecoxib IC50  34.3 M).1 Inspired by the unique structure of 
rauvomine B (2) and seeking to develop a new synthetic entry to the sarpagine family for further biological screening, we 
embarked upon a total synthesis of 2.

Description:
A motif for which synthetic solutions have not been reported.

Text:
While the Cook group has developed an approach to the less common C19 methylbearing sarpagines,16 
synthetic solutions to the alkyl chloride or cyclopropane motifs have not been reported to date. One preliminary study by 
the Lei group explicitly targets the rauvomine alkaloids.27 While these authors are able to access the core sarpagan scaffold 
using established PictetSpengler (9  10) and Dieckmann (10  11) disconnections popularized by Cook, neither the C
19 stereocenter nor the cyclopropane or chloro motifs have yet been addressed.
