Description:
A polluting gas whose emissions are reduced by efficient combustion.

Text:
Because it is an oxygenated 
45 
fuel and free of aromatic and sulfurized components, it has a more efficient combustion, 
46 
reducing the emissions of many polluting gases, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
47 
hydrocarbons, and particulate matter 34. Comparatively, butanol has demonstrated 
48 
potential as a fuel soon, with energetic power comparable to petrofuels while being less 
49 
corrosive, less volatile, and less explosive 6. Furthermore, butanol can be obtained from 
50 
biomass through the acetonebutanolethanol (ABE) fermentation process 22. 51 
Among the many physicalchemical properties that a fuel needs to meet to be used, 
52 
the flash point (FP) is a property that is intimately connected to the volatility of flammable 
53 
liquids or fuels.
