Description:
A product of the electrochemical splitting of water and involved in the oxygen evolution reaction.

Text:
The electrochemical splitting of water into 
hydrogen and oxygen is a pivotal process for 
achieving carbonneutral energy production. When coupled with renewably green electricity 
sources, this approach can form the basis of a 
fully sustainable energy scheme.1,2 However, 
significant challenges remain, including the 
highly oxidative conditions, slow kinetics of 
protoncoupled 
multielectron 
transfer, 
and 
substantial 
energetic 
activation 
barriers 
associated with the indispensable oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER).35 Traditionally, noble 
metal oxides such as RuO26 and IrO2,7 known 
for their high activity toward OER, have been the 
benchmark electrocatalysts.
