Description:
A nucleobase found in DNA and RNA, pairs with thymine in DNA.

Text:
The genetic information, or genetic code, is stored within the specific sequence
of the DNA helix, which naturally contains only four NABs adenine (A), thymine (T),
cytosine (C), and guanine (G). When RNA is considered, uracil (U) replaces thymine as
one of the bases, resulting in a fivebase system across both DNA and RNA.1113 Expanding
the genetic alphabet beyond these natural bases could potentially increase the capacity for
