Antimicrobial resistance represents one of the current biggest healththreats worldwide,
26
whose impact has been heightened by the escalation of multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram
27
negative bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneu
28
moniae head the WHO list of priority pathogens not responding to frontline antibiotics1,
29
and their ability to grow as biofilms further heightens their role as troublesome pathogens
30
highly associated with lower respiratory infections and with high mortalitymorbidity rates2. 31
Polymyxins (PMs) B and E are the two most studied and utilized variants of the an
32
timicrobial peptide PM group and are currently used in last resort treatments for Gram
33
negative bacterial infections3.
