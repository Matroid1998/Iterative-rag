Description:
Forms stronger water-ion bonds than weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules.

Text:
Thus, there are no longer any weak 
hydrogen bonds between water molecules present, but only stronger waterion bonds. This can increase 
the electrochemical stability window to values above 3V 12. This waterinsalt concept has first been 
applied to Liion batteries, but it has also been extended to sodiumion batteries NaBs 13. Sodium is 
much more earthabundant than Lithium. Recently, sodiumion batteries have drawn a lot of attention as 
an alternative cell chemistry for mobile and also in particular stationary applications 1415. Typically, their 
production does not require any critical raw materials. Their energy densities and cyclability can still not 
fully compete with Liion batteries, but they promise to be less expensive together with better charging 
and ion mobility properties.
