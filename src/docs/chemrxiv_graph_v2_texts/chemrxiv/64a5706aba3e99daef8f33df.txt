Description:
Involved in oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions.

Text:
Catalysis through Nickel designed composite materials has grown exponentially for considerable applications in
the past few decades. As it has a strong affinity for cobalt, copper, and many other transition metals. Thus,
present to it real sophisticated advantages in various technological fields. Research for discovering highly active,
selective and stable catalysts has been carefully regarded for material engineering for many energy fields and
other applications using both simulation and experimental methods 1,5. for exemple, these reactions, oxygen
reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and both Hydrogen oxidation (HOR)reduction (HRR) so well
studied in recent years through diverse form of materials as fully shown in this research articles 6,8.
