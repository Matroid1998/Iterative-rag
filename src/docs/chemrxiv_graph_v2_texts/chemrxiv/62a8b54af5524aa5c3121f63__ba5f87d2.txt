Description:
A motif that releases positively charged amine motifs that localize in the mitochondria or lysosomes.

Text:
Of the hypoxia sensing probes developed to date, only the azobased probes 
developed by Piao et al. and Zhang et al. can detect milder levels of hypoxia.21,25 These probes are both based on 
the arylazo motif, which releases positively charged amine motifs that localize in the mitochondria or lysosomes. Here we report a complementary approach, based on the4,5indolequinone scaffold, to develop hypoxiasensing 
probes that detect different levels of hypoxia in 2D and 3D cell culture. We show that the indolequinone groups 
are readily amenable to chemical modification through ether bond formation with the commonly used 
fluorophores 9H(1,3dichloro9,9dimethylacridin2one7yl (DDAO),2628 resorufin,29 and MeTokyo green,30 
affording a range of hypoxiasensing fluorescent probes 14 (Figure 1).
