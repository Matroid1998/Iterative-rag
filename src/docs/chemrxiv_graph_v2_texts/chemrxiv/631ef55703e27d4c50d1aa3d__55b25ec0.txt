Description:
A high energy chemical used in CO2 hydrogenation and produced by renewable electrochemistry.

Text:
CO2 hydrogenation to CO via the reverse water gas shift reaction (rWGSR, eq 1) could be important
for making the chemical industry more sustainable. The rWGSR is both a way to convert CO2 into CO,
which can be used directly as feedstock in syngas chemistry,1 and a way to utilize hydrogen, which is
the high energy chemical most straightforwardly produced by renewable powered electrochemistry.2,3
CO2(g)  H2(g)  CO(g)  H2O(g)

CO2 hydrogenation can also form CH3OH and CH4 instead of CO.4,5 Figure 1 shows reaction
free energies to form the three products at the standard state pressure (i.e. 0.1 MPa pressure for all
species) and with 2 MPa H2 pressure. The thermodynamic data in Figure 1 is taken from ref 68.
