Description:
An epitranscriptomic modification observed in various RNAs.

Text:
Acetylation of the nucleoside cytidine, which gives the N4acetylcytidine (ac4C, Figure 1) 
epitranscriptomic modification, has been observed in RNAs including tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs and various 
regulatory RNAs. It plays a wide range of roles in biological systems. Errors related to the modification 
have been found to be associated with many human diseases 1, 2. More recently, acetylation of 
deoxycytidine, which gives the N4acetyldeoxycytidine (4acC, Figure 1) epigenetic modification, has also 
been discovered in the DNA of Arabidopsis, rice, maize, mouse, and human. It is mainly located around 
transcription start sites and positively correlates with gene expression levels 3. Several studies using 
synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) have shown that acetylation of 
cytosine can increase the UV melting temperature of duplex oligonucleotides (ONs) by 1  8 C 46.
