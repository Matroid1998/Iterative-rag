Description:
Generates hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals from H2O2 via a Fenton reaction.

Text:
Ferroptosis is an atypical oxidative form of regulated ne
crotic cell death that is characterized by the peroxidation 
of membrane phospholipids which contain polyunsaturat
ed fatty acids.1 This process is dependent on Fe2 which 
generates hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (OOH) radi
cals from H2O2 via a Fenton reaction.2 If the production of 
these reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceeds beyond the 
antioxidant capacity of a cell, accumulated lipid peroxides 
initiate an autoxidation cascade that results in the rupture 
of the membrane.
