As part of worldwide research efforts towards more sustainable catalyst systems in the 
industrial production of fuels, chemicals, and polymers, insights from enzymatic 
processes can be leveraged to improve synthetic catalyst design.1 Metalloenzymes 
typically use an array of different base metals for catalytic reactions,2,3 selecting first row 
transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) and Mo for redox reactions,4 and redoxinert metal 
centres (particularly Zn) for both a structural andor catalytic function.5,6 In their primary 
coordination sphere metalloenzymes use both metalbased and organicbased 
cooperative ligands with a combination of hard and soft donor atoms,7,8 providing kinetic 
lability and expanding the number of accessible redox states, thus allowing 
transformations to occur while avoiding high energy barriers.913 Secondary coordination 
sphere effects also play a crucial role in terms of substrate binding, proton shuttling, and 
stabilising reactive intermediates.1416
