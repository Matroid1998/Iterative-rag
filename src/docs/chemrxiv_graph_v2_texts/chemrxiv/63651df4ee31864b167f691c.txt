Description:
A biocompatible and preferably biodegradable polymer used in biomedical applications.

Text:
The presence of such distinct phases in the polymer allows it to 
be fixed into a temporary shape by deformation (governed by netpoints or hard segments) 
below the transition temperature, followed by recovery into original shape (influenced by 
molecular switches or soft segments) upon heating it above the transition temperature. Owing 
to this intrinsic property of temperatureassisted shape recovery, SMPs have been explored for 
various potential applications, such as soft robotics5, grippers6, selfdeployable structures in 
space applications7, and biomedical applications8. In the field of biomedicine, it is also essential that the SMP being used is biocompatible and 
preferably biodegradable. There exists only a handful of polymer candidates meeting these 
stringent requirements, such as polylactic acid9 (PLA), polyurethanes10 (PUs), their blends, 
epoxybased thermosets11, etc.
