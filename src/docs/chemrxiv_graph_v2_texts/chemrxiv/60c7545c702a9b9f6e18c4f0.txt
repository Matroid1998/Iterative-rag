Description:
Involved in the photoactivated hydrogen evolution reaction in artificial photocatalysis.

Text:
The CataLight Young Scientist Symposium (CYSS, www.cyss2020.de) was planned as an onsite 
conference in Ulm, Germany, in autumn 2020. Its board of organization consists of PhD students 
and earlycareer, i.e. within the first two years after obtaining their PhD, postdocs who perform 
research within the framework of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft funded Transregional 
Collaborative Research Center TRR234, CataLight 1, a project with particular emphasis on 
artificial photocatalysis and the photoactivated hydrogen evolution reaction. Similarly, the 
target audience of CYSS were young scientists at an early career stage, i.e., PhD students, 
postdocs, and graduate students, working in the fields of photocatalysis and photochemistry.
