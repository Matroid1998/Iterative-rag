Description:
Undergo chiral nickel-bisoxazoline-catalyzed asymmetric cross-electrophile couplings.

Text:
Representative strategies include Fus seminal studies on the Nicatalyzed 
asymmetric Negishi arylation of alkyl electrophiles,5 in addition to the Ni, Co, and Fecatalyzed Kumada arylation of bromoketones, 
bromo esters, and chloroesters that have been independently reported by Fu, ZhongBian, and Nakamura (Figure 1B, a).6 
Alternatively, the Nicatalyzed enantioselective reductive crosselectrophile coupling provides a promising paradigm for arylation of 
sp3hybridized electrophiles by using another electrophilic aryl halides, in the presence of stoichiometric organic or metal reductants, 
and thereby circumventing the use of sensitive organometallic reagents.7 A range of studies from Doyle,8a Wang,8b LeiGong,9a 
Reisman,9b Shi,9c and Wang9d demonstrate that styrenyl aziridines, CF3substituted alkyl bromides, chlorosulfones, chloroesters, 
benzylic chlorides, and propargylic chlorides undergo chiral nickelbisoxazolinecatalyzed asymmetric crosselectrophile couplings to 
afford the chiral arylated products with high enantioselectivity (Figure 1B, b).
