1214 A circulatory material ow could oer remedy in the
described scenario, but issues concerning sustainable manufacturing15 and recycling 12,16 of
currently used battery materials are not fully resolved yet. Therefore, it does not come as a
surprise that the employment of more abundant and potentially greener materials has been
suggested by several authors. 1719
In order to suce user demands on range and exibility of mobile applications, one partic
ular requirement on the energy storage is high energy density andor high specic energy.20
Concerning batteries, although substantial improvements on the engineering level have been
made recently, on the materials side there are so far no postLi alternatives reaching up
to the performance of stateoftheart technologies based on lithium ion shuttles.
