Description:
Compositions that can preferentially distort to form rosetteicosahedral structures instead of Mackay icosahedral structures.

Text:
A small number of
PtAu compositions will preferentially distort to form
rosetteicosahedral instead of the Mackay icosahedral
structures.30 The GA locates these structures in a num
ber of cases, though as structure optimization is not the
focus of these benchmarks, when the rosette distortion
occurs, the calculations are prevented from entering the
population preserving the template structure. The excess energy is used to assign tness within the
GA, as in Equation 1.
