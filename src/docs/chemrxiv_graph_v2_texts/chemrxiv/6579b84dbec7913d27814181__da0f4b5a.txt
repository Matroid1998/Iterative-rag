Twodimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures have
emerged as intriguing novel material platforms, offering distinctive phys
ical and chemical properties 15. These characteristics have the po
tential to unlock exciting opportunities for innovative functional ap
plications in (opto)electronic devices 6, 7, electrocatalysis 8, 9 and
energy storage 1012. Among the various 2D materials, semicon
ducting transitionmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs) containing molyb
denum (Mo) have garnered significant attention within the scientific
community. The heightened interest is primarily due to their excep
tional electronic and optical properties, which can be finely tuned by
controlling factors like thickness, composition, and structural defects
1317.
