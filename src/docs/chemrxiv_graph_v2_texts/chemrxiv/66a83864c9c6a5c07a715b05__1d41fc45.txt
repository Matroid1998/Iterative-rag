Description:
Part of the structure that enhances the acidity of the remaining CH moiety.

Thus, Tf2NH and related nitrogen acids have been introduced into 
polymer science and used in various applications, offering a new 
class of polymers with strong acid moieties and their 
derivatives.5 Among polymers with strong acid moieties, 
bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylmethane (Tf2CH2; Tf  CF3SO2) is 
attractive because the tetravalency of its central carbon atom 
enables the synthesis of several derivatives through the 
replacement of one proton on the carbon atom. Such derivatives 
exhibit strong acidities comparable to those of organic sulfonic 
acids and sulfuric acid because the presence of two adjacent 
(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl groups effectively enhances the acidity of 
the remaining CH moiety. Owing to the strong acidities of Tf2CH
based carbon acids, their conjugate bases are highly stable 
carbon anions.
