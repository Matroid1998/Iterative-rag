Description:
Can be deprotonated by nickel-bound triethylamine for cross-coupling with aryl triflates.

Text:
Milder and more costeffective alkyl amines present a promising alternative but often lack sufficient basicity for effective 
deprotonation.44 To tackle this, Buchwald and coworkers elegantly designed an electrondeficient ligand that allows the 
deprotonation of nickelbound anilines with triethylamine for crosscoupling with aryl triflates.45 Notably, using the more 
nucleophilic base, DBU, inhibits the reaction due to its preferential coordination to nickel, demonstrating the additional layer 
of complexity in achieving the optimal balance between ligands and bases when working with weakly nucleophilic coupling 
partners.
