Description:
A moiety in Sanguinamide A replaced with aromatic groups to study changes in membrane permeability.

of aromatic groups in the peptide 
backbone to address this limitation. Starting from model peptide Sanguinamide A, we 
synthesized a series of analogues in which the native thiazole moiety was replaced with 
various simple aromatic groups. This approach allowed us to systematically investigate how 
minimal changes in the nature of the aromatic group and the flexibility of the peptide backbone 
influence membrane permeability. Significant differences in permeability were observed 
among the analogues, and for those that were permeable, NMR spectroscopy revealed 
conformational changes in response to environment polarity. In addition to studying 
permeability, we assessed the impact of these chemical modifications on biological activity 
using a targetagnostic cell painting assay.
