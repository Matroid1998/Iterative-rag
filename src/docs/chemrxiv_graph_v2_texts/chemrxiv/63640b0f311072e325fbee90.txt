Description:
Involved in O-linked glycosylation at the side chains of serine or threonine residues.

Text:
Glycosylation is an important and prevalent posttranslational modification that plays a role in 
diverse biological functions including protein folding, intracellular signaling, and immune 
response.1 Glycosylation occurs when glycan chains become covalently attached to side chains 
of proteins and leads to increased structural heterogeneity.2 In response to physiological 
changes, the structure and distribution of glycans at a particular glycosite (microheterogeneity) 
and the presence or absence of a glycan at a glycosite (macroheterogeneity) can be altered.3,4 
The two most common types of protein glycosylation are Olinked glycosylation, which occurs at 
the oxygen of serine or threonine residues, and Nlinked glycosylation, which occurs at the 
amide nitrogen of the asparagine residues side chain in the predictable sequence Asparagine
XSerineThreonine (NXS or NXT), where X is any amino acid except proline.5,6
