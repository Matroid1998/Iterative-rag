Description:
Clusters formed by water molecules bound to undercoordinated Fe3 ions.

Text:
The PB structural framework is highly flexible, forming a cubic structure that can accommodate up to 25 FeII(CN)64 
defects, with the subsequent undercoordinated Fe3 ions being bound to water, forming (H2O)6 clusters (Scheme 1).1316 In addition, the 
structure can accommodate significant amounts of uncoordinated occluded water.17,18 These structural variations influence the location 
of A site alkali cations within PB, which has ramifications in understanding the balance of charges during redox processes.15,17,19,20 In an 
ideal structure (Scheme 1a), reduction of Fe3III sites is balanced by the intercalation of K within the vacant channels of the structure, with 
the fully reduced Fe2FeII structure, known as Prussian white (PW) having a 11 KFe ratio. In the fully oxidized Fe3FeIII structure, commonly 
referred to as Berlin Green (BG), K is fully deintercalated.
