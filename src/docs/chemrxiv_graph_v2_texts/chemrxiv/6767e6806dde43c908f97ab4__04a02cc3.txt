Description:
A cardenolide that inhibits the membrane potential generating function of the Na,K-ATPase.

Another early observation was a possible involvement
of the plasma membrane resident Na,KATPase. This finding was based on the inhibition of
unconventional secretion of FGF2 by ouabain, a cardenolide that was known to inhibit the membrane
potential generating function of this ATPdependent ion pump (Florkiewicz, Anchin, and Baird 1998). However, all of these observations were solely based upon pharmacological evidence and, therefore, not
fully conclusive. Due to the lack at the time of advanced techniques such as genomewide screening
systems based upon RNA interference or CRISPR gene knockouts, as well as the unavailability of
sophisticated in vitro reconstitution systems, mechanistic insights into the molecular machinery mediating
unconventional secretion of FGF2 became available only much later starting in the mid2000s. Figure 1. FGF2 unconventional secretion mechanism.
