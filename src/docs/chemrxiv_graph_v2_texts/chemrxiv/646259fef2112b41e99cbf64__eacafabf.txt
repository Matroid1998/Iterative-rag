Description:
Polymers with anionic groups in their backbones used in single ion conducting solid polymer electrolytes.

. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been studied since the early 1980s as a promising 
alternative to conventional liquid electrolytes for nextgeneration batteries.1,2 SPEs composed of high 
molecular weight polymers (typically 5,000 gmol) have nearly zero vapor pressure and much higher 
autoignition points than common liquid electrolytes, rendering them potentially safer.2 A subclass of solid 
polymer electrolytes referred to as single ion conducting (SIC) polymers feature anionic groups within the 
polymer sidechains (i.e., ionomers) or backbones (i.e., ionenes).3 SIC SPEs often display higher cation 
transference numbers (the fraction of charge carried by the cations), than conventional SPEs, which can 
increase battery power4,5 and suppress dendrite growth.6 Nevertheless, dry SIC SPEs typically show low 
ionic conductivities due to their large energy barriers for polymer segmental motion andor cation 
dissociation.
