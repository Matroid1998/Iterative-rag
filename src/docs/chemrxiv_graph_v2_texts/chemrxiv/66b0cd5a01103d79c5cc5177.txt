Description:
Used in single-junction solar cells with a power conversion efficiency capped at the detailed balance limit of 33.7%.

Text:
Solar cells are a cornerstone in transitioning from fossil
based to CO2neutral energy production, with the power
conversion efficiency constituting an essential performance
parameter. 1 Unfortunately, the efficiency of the predomi
nant singlejunction silicon solar cells is capped at the de
tailed balance limit of 33.7.
