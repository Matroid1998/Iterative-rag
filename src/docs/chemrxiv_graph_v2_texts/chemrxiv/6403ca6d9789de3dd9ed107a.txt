Description:
A class of heteroaromatic compounds isomeric to the indole motif.

Text:
paraQuinone methides (pQMs) are a variety of compounds that have been 
extensively studied in the organic synthesis field over the past few years.1 They can be 
characterized as reactive intermediates containing an electrophilic site.2 Therefore, there 
is recent development of nucleophilic additions to pQMs as 1,6Michael acceptors using 
different types of catalysts.3 Some Lewis acids can be used as catalysts in these reactions 
since they coordinate with the carbonyl group of the pQMs, rendering the olefin more 
electrophilic and thus more prone to 1,6nucleophilic conjugate addition.4 To the best of 
our knowledge, the reaction between paraquinone methides and indolizines have not 
been extensively studied. Indolizines are a class of heteroaromatic compounds isomeric to the indole motif.

Description:
Substrates used in C3-functionalization and conjugated additions to unsaturated systems.

Text:
disclosed a Bronsted acidcatalyzed 
protocol to the C3functionalization of indolizines, which focused on orthomethide 
quinones as substrates (Scheme 1a).7b paraMethide quinones (used as substrate or 
generated in situ from dehydration of a parahydroxybenzyl alcohol) were also shown to 
be suitable electrophilic partners in this reaction, nevertheless only two examples were 
reported and in moderate yields. Consequently, the former examples of alkylation of 
indolizines with pQMs suffered from limited scope in terms of both reactants. In previous works carried out by our research group, we have developed some 
synthetic methodologies exploring indolizines as substrates in conjugated additions to 
,unsaturated systems. In 2017, the enantioselective conjugate addition of indolizines 
to enones catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid (S)TRIP was explored.
