Description:
Compounds that can form covalent bonds with polysaccharides through various grafting methods.

Text:
However, the large gap in polarity between 
polysaccharides and (co)polyesters results in high interfacial tensions, poor compatibility and 
low adhesion at the interfaces or interphases 4,5. To overcome these major issues, many 
compatibilization strategies have been investigated allowing the development of more or less 
performing multilayers and blends 6,7, such as the addition of a copolymer system comprising 
blocks compatible with each phase 8. Several macromolecular architectures have been 
developed and reported in this context, comprising covalent bonds between polysaccharides 
and polyesters by different grafting methods, such as the ring opening polymerization of cyclic 
esters onto the hydroxyl (OH) groups of the polysaccharides, the direct polycondensation 
starting on OH groups, or the radical couplings or catalyzed esterifications 8,9.
