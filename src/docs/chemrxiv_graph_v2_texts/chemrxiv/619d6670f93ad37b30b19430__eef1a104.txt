Description:
Constitutes the core of many natural homotropane alkaloids.

Text:
Nitrogencontaining moieties are omnipresent in natural products, biologically active compounds and 
agricultural chemicals. In particular, the 8azabicyclo3.2.1octane and 9azabicyclo3.3.1nonane 
skeletons constitute the core of many natural tropane1 and homotropane alkaloids,2 respectively, and 
analogues presenting a wide range of biological activities. For instance, tropinone, cocaine and 
scopolamine (Figure 1) are amongst the most popular representative examples of natural alkaloids 
presenting a 8azabicyclo3.2.1octane (tropane) skeleton as their base structure. Unlike its natural 
enantiomer, unnatural ()ferruginine (Figure 1), is a good agonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
(nAchR). The 9azabicyclo3.3.1nonane (homotropane) skeleton can be found in the structure of ()
adaline, and ()euphococcinine (Figure 1),2 two important defensive alkaloids from, respectively, the 
European ladybug Adalia bipunctata and the Australian ladybug Cryptolaemis montrouzieri. 2
