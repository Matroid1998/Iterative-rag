Description:
Acts as an electron donor when interacting with NO2.

However, this alone does not mean that they can fully mitigate
the issue, as this does not allow a clear derivation of the percentile
composition in gas mixtures because different analytes can produce the
same responses depending on their concentration. The issue of selectivity of chemiresistors cannot be resolved simply
by a high sensitivity toward one analyte. Rather, this requires effective
sensor arrays 2931, and to empower them, other physicochemical
properties of TMDs must be explored. One such feature may be the
recently reported variation in the acceptordonor character of TMDs
32. It was shown that when interacting with NO2a good electron
acceptormonolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum
diselenide (MoSe2), and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) act as elec
tron donors.
