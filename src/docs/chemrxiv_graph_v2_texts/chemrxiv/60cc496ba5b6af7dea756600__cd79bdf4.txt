Description:
Difficult to separate from N2 due to similar physical properties such as kinetic diameter, polarizability, and boiling point.

Whilst several MOFs based on firstrow transition metals are 
known for switchable magnetic characteristics under the influence of guest molecule7, 
temperature8, and pressure,9 there are only a few reports on high selectivity towards oxygen. The 
selective adsorption of oxygen over other gases that generate high purity oxygen ( 99) has 
applications in healthcare, oxyfuel combustion10, ozone generation, semiconductors and other 
industries. This is a challenging task, as the separation of O2 from the N2 mixture is a hassle due 
to the similarity in their physical properties11, such as kinetic diameter, polarizability, boiling point, 
etc. The current industry standard is cryogenic separation, which demands high pressure, 
temperature and large infrastructure that escalate production costs. Thus, an alternative separation 
technique based on porous material is in high demand.
