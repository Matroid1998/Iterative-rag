Description:
Hydrogenated towards methane using H2 produced with electrolysis of water.

Text:
The methanation reaction set the basis for similar reactions based on COx 
10 
hydrogenation, which involve the formation of higher hydrocarbons 1012 or alcohols 13,14. 11 
In the overarching concept hydrogenation of CO2 or CO towards methane is performed utilizing 
12 
H2 produced with electrolysis of water. In a broader perspective, the PtG process can be 
13 
extended to the production of various hydrocarbons relevant for the use in the energy sector 
14 
or in the chemical value chain via the more general PowertoX approach 15. Already in 1902 
15 
Sabatier et al. discovered that methane is formed on Ni based catalysts according to the 
16 
stoichiometric eqs. (1) and (2) 16.

Description:
Involved in hydrogenation reactions and can react with water to form CO2 and H2.

Besides these benefits for Fe based catalysts, additional watergasshift

(WGS, (3)) activity has to be considered as a competing reaction in CO2 hydrogenation 23, 
25 
while solid carbon formation via Boudouard reaction (4) and the formation of ethylene (5) as

major byproduct plays a potential role for CO hydrogenation under low temperature and
