Description:
The freebase anion whose X-ray structure has been presented.

Text:
If so, are cis tautomers (one or more among AB, CD, BC, and AD) involved as 
intermediates? Might the cis tautomers prove observable or even isolable? Herein we present the 
Xray structure of freebase tris(pcyanophenyl)corrole anion and an extensive set of DFT 
calculations that shed light on the these questions.
