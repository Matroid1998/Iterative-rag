Description:
A moiety found in natural products that demonstrates moderate antibacterial and antifungal inhibition against resistant microbes.

The alarming global increase in antimicrobial resistance has created a pressing need to 
expand the chemical space of antimicrobials to mitigate infectious diseases.1 Natural products 
containing a carboxy2Hazirine moiety have garnered attention for demonstrating moderate 
antibacterial and antifungal inhibition against resistant microbes.24 Thus far, nine such carboxy
2Hazirine natural products have been identified; the structures are shown in Figure 1. These 
unique products have been isolated from marine sponge sources (Dysidea fragilis 14, and 
Siliquaria spongia, 3EAnMe)46 and from bacterial sources (marine cyanobacterium Caldora 
sp., 5EDyH and Streptomyces aureus, 6AzH).7,8 These products (16) display a high degree 
of chemical similarity; many have a long alkyl chain and are geometric isomers or contain terminal 
halogenated chains.

Notably, 14 are have a methyl ester and 5EDyH and 6AzH were 
characterized as a free acid. Compound 6AzH is the smallest of these natural products, 
composed of the minimal structural core, the carboxy2Hazirine, but lacking the long alkyl chain. Figure 1 Structures of the nine known natural products that contain a carboxy2Hazirine. The 
characteristic carboxy2Hazirine moiety is highlighted in purple.
