Description:
A gas that can be utilized to produce renewable fuels and prevent its release into the atmosphere.

Text:
As atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise and emerging geopolitical issues threaten global en
ergy supplies, novel methods of forming fuels sustainably and without geographic restrictions 
are required for a secure energy supply in a future net zero carbon economy. The utilization of 
low concentrations of CO2 holds considerable promise given its potential to both produce re
newable fuels and prevent the release of CO2 into the atmosphere through the conversion of 
flue gases, or even directly remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere.1 However, electrochemi
cal CO2 reduction (CO2R) has so far focused on the utilization of saturated (100) CO2 streams 
as stateoftheart catalysts perform poorly under low CO2 concentrations due to the low availa
bility of dissolved CO2 (12 M at atmospheric CO2 concentrations, 420 ppm).

Description:
A compound involved in carbon capture and utilization from dilute gas streams.

Text:
However, CO2 concentration 
from atmosphere for this stepwise process must incur substantial energy and cost penalties 
(projected to be 9 GJ ton1 and 94232 ton1)4 to enable efficient carbon capture and utilization 
from dilute gas streams. This must also be addressed alongside common challenges in capture 
streams with impurities such as O2, NOx and SOx.8,9
