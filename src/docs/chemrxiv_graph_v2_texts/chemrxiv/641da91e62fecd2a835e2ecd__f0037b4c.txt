Description:
Induces a strong ligand field upon adsorption, affecting spin-state transitions.

ceptionally large working capacities 19 and low regeneration
energies were obtained as a result of a stepshaped isotherm
resulting from a cooperative change in the gas binding prop
erties upon electronic transition. The spinstate transition
from high spin (HS) to low spin (LS) occurred as a function
of the CO partial pressure, as a result of the strong ligand
field induced by CO upon adsorption. Once the HSLS
is triggered at all Fe centers, the uptake is shown to in
crease abruptly as a consequence of the significantly larger
CO binding energy expected at LS compared to HS.

Efficiently adsorbs and desorbs due to large gas-induced ligand field splittings.

The change in the affinity of the adsorbent material for
the gas reported by Long and coworkers 18,19 arises from the
change in the occupation of the antibonding dz2. This idea
had already been shown in general terms by some of the
present authors using ab initio electronic structure calcula
tions 15 and will be leveraged here to demonstrate the feasi
bility of a more general spincrossover induced gas release. In point of fact, the efficient CO adsorptiondesorption pro
cess discussed above relies on the stepshaped adsorption
isotherms that may be possible only for large gasinduced
ligand field splittings such as for CO, and thus cannot be
applied for most gases.
