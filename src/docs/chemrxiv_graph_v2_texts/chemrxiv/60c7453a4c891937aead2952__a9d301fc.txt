tection of phosphate esters, which would also allow 
parallel and straightforward manipulation of the amino 
and carboxyprotecting groups common in biomolecule 
substrates. We initially envisaged the use of an acidlabile pro
tecting group strategy through the installation of tert
butyl phosphate esters.22 Although OtBuphospho
ramidite reagents were effective for alcohol phosphor
ylation, yields were often poor due to the high bulk of 
the tBu ester. Attempts to utilise tertbutanol as a sac
rificial alcohol following substrate treatment with POCl3 
also proved ineffective. As an alternative, we reasoned 
that allyl protection would deliver an effective means to 
protect key functional groups during synthesis, and a 
convenient handle for palladium catalysed deprotect
