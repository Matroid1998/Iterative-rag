Description:
A significant amount is released during Lewis acid-catalyzed polycondensation reactions, impacting the porosity of generated polymers.

Additionally, the solvents used in these protocols are a major 
source of waste generation in the chemical industry 
today.28,29,30 
The drawbacks of solutionbased protocols have created a 
demand 
for 
alternative 
reaction 
pathways, 
with 
mechanochemistry arising as one of the top 10 emerging 
innovations in chemistry, according to the International Union 
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).31 Unlike solutionbased 
protocols, mechanochemical reactions are initiated by 
mechanical 
force, 
resulting 
in 
a 
solventfree 
and 
straightforward reaction, attributed to a constant generation of 
reactive 
surface 
and 
adequate 
mass 
transportation.32 
Mechanochemistry offers several advantages over traditional 
solutionbased 
protocols, 
including 
circumventing 
the 
production of toxic solvent waste and faster reaction 
rates.33,34,35,36,37 
Due 
to 
the 
numerous 
advantages 
it 
offers, 
the 
mechanochemical generation of POPs has received increasing 
attention in recent years.32,38,39,40,41 Lewis acidcatalyzed 
polycondensation protocols, such as the Scholl or FriedelCrafts 
polymerization, are particularly popular due to their speed, 
versatility, and cost efficiency.42,43,44,45,46,47,48 During these 
reactions, a significant amount of HCl is released into the sealed 
milling vessels, which has a direct impact on the porosity of the 
generated polymers.42 Additionally, the setup of milling 
parameters and choice of liquidassisted grinding agents have 
also been found to be crucial in this regard.44,47 Despite these 
developments, ball mills are still considered as black boxes, 
and a deep understanding of the underlying principles that 
result in the formation of porous polymers is urgently required.
