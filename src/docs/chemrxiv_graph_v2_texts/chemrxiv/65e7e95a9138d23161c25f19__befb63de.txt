Lithium ion (Li) batteries (LIBs) play a vital role in various electronic devices in 
todays society,1 but the limited and uneven distribution of lithium resources makes 
them difficult to meet the needs of largescale applications. For this reason, batteries 
based on earthabundant alkalimetals, also known as post LIBs, have been 
proposed as alternatives,27 and the discovery of anode materials suitable for various 
alkalimetal ion batteries (AMIBs) has become an important topic in scientific 
community. Carbonaceous electrode materials, including puredopedhybrid forms of 
carbon nanomaterials with sp2hybridization such as fullerenes, graphene, and carbon 
nanotubes, are attracting significant attention as promising anode candidates for 
AMIBs. The recent report by Kothandam et al.
