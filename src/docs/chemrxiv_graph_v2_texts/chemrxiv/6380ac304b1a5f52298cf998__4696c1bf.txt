Description:
Unusual carbon-rich precursors with n values of 6, 4, and 2.

Although C18 molecule has 
been generated and imaged experimentally, due to its high chemical activity, it cannot 
be stably separated at present. In contrast, the four precursors are stable under ambient 
conditions, and some of them have even determined by Xray diffraction.1,2 In fact, 
there is evidence that similar or identical intermediates exist in the gasphase reaction 
as early as 1991.36 Based on this reality, it is more practical, at least at this stage, to 
explore the physicochemical properties and application prospects of the unusual 
carbonrich precursors C18(CO)n (n  6, 4, and 2) and C18Br6. The conjugation and aromaticity are usually of primary interest for closed ring 
molecules, especially when they are nicely planar.
