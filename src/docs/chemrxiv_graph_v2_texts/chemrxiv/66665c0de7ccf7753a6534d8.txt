Kirigami, an extended version of origami allowing cuts, has moved beyond its conventional 
usages as craft activities.1 Recently the kirigamic design principles have extended to 
mechanical engineering,2 making it possible to create highly deformable 3D structures with 
mechanical functionalities.35 These structural features have led to the advances in 
programmable mechanical metamaterials69 applicable to electronicsfree robots,10 pressure 
sensors,11 antennas,12 electronic devices,13 and metasurfaces.14 Kirigami tessellations, 
composed of embedded patterns are the key features for these recent applications, as 
exemplified by a twodimensional (2D) molecular framework based on an origami tessellation 
(Figure 1A, Table S1).1523 Despite the advent of various foldable materials, however, 
developing 3D folding solidstate structures remains an important challenge at the nano and 
molecular scale.24 
To create a solidstate kirigami, we envisioned that ZIFs,2527 a subclass of metalorganic 
frameworks (MOFs) with zeolitic topologies, are an ideal platform, due to their highly 
deformable nature under various stimuli.28 Notably, tetrahedral Zn metal centers can act as 
pivoting points, resulting in unique mechanical properties in contrast to zeolites.2932 
Here, we report a kirigamic characteristics of gisZIF1,29 composed of 4membered rings 
(4MRs) acting as rigid tiles.
