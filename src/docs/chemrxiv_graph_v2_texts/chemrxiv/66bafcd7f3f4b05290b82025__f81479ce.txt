Description:
Undergo enantioselective oxidation to introduce oxygen functionalities.

Text:
Direct enantioselective functionalization of C(sp3)H bonds in organic molecules is one of the 
ultimate goals of organic synthesis due to its remarkable atomeconomy and stepeconomy (16). Methods such as the enantioselective oxidation of the C(sp3)H bonds, which involve directly 
introducing oxygen functionalities into alkanes, hold significant potential for the discovery and 
development of new pharmaceuticals (79). Chiral oxygenated aliphatic structures are common in 
bioactive compounds such as natural products and pharmaceuticals (10, 11). Recent progress has 
been made in enantioselective CC and CN bond formation from C(sp3)H bonds using transition
metal catalysts (1216). However, the enantioselective formation of CO bonds by C(sp3)H 
oxidation remains a formidable challenge (Fig. 1A) (1724).
