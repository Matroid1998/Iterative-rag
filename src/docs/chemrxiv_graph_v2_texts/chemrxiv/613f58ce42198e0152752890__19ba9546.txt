Description:
A redox center with hydrophobic properties used in AORFBs.

Text:
Additionally, the technology still stands to benefit greatly from improved synthetic methods, 
47 
as well as systematic investigations into how the properties of redox molecules depend on the water
48 
solubilizing groups and the way in which they are bound to redox cores. 49 
Watersoluble quinone derivatives used for AORFBs comprise two motifs, the hydrophobic quinone 
50 
redox center and the hydrophilic watersolubilizing groups, including SO3 CO2,10 PO32,11 NR4,12, 
51 
13 O,7 and polyethylene glycol (PEG)14.
