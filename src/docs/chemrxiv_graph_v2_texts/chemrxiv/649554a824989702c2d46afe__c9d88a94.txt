Description:
A form of nitrogen that is reduced to bioavailable forms by nitrogen-fixing microorganisms.

Text:
Nitrogen fixation, a critical process for sustaining life on Earth, plays an essential role in the
global nitrogen cycle, and provides bioavailable nitrogen for the growth and development
of all living organisms. Although the atmosphere is composed of approximately 78
nitrogen, its inert nature renders it inaccessible to most life forms. Nature has evolved an
intricate mechanism to overcome this barrier, primarily through the activity of nitrogen
fixing microorganisms capable of reducing dinitrogen (N2) into bioavailable forms such
as ammonia (NH3). Nitrogen fixation driven by transition metal complexes offers a
less energy intensive alternative to the conventional HaberBosch process 1. These
complexes can effectively catalyze the conversion of N2 to NH3 under similar conditions
as the nitrogenase enzymes in nature.

Description:
A molecule that can be reduced to ammonia under ambient conditions using molybdenum-based complexes.

Text:
A key breakthrough was Schrocks discovery of
molybdenumbased complexes capable of binding and reducing dinitrogen to ammonia
under ambient conditions. His work led to the development of the first welldefined,
homogeneous catalyst containing a single metal site for nitrogen fixation, known as the
