Description:
Cationic pillars used in the topotactic insertion to expand the lattice parameters of MoS2.

Specifically, it was demonstrated that lowering the pH of the reactant 
solution of the hydrothermal synthesis will yield smaller crystallite sizes.7 Other studies have 
shown that the lattice parameters of MoS2 can be directly tuned, for example, by the 
introduction of foreign species  pillars into the interlayer space, expanding the clattice 
parameter.8 This includes topdown approaches like the topotactic insertion of 
alkylammonium cationic pillars as demonstrated by Schllhorn et al., however a previous 
chemical reduction and ion exchange are required.9,10 In summary, the structural properties 
of MoS2 can be tuned individually by different approaches at several length scales, from 
macroscopic tuning of particle or crystallite size, down to the microscopic tuning of lattice 
parameters like the interlayer spacing.11 It would be desirable to control MoS2 structure over 
several length scales at once in a onepot synthesis approach, allowing to readily tailor 
emerging MoS2 functional properties.
