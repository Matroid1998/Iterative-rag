Description:
A coupling partner used in the formation of biaryl compounds.

groups on the naphthol coupling partner was possible. A 6bromo substituent coupled effectively to afford biaryl 3aa 
124 
in 66 yield and 937 e.r. ; a more conjugating group in 6phenyl was also successful to afford 3ab with lower 
125 
conversion (52 yield) and 9010 e.r. We are able to accommodate groups on both coupling partners a 6methyl 
126 
indole coupled with a 6bromo naphthol to exclusively afford the heterocoupled biaryl 3ac (67 yield; 8812 e.r.). 127 
This principle can be extended to the formation of different biaryls such as 3ad (76 yield, 919 e.r.).

Description:
A component that can be substituted to form various products.

Different 
128 
substituents on the naphthol component can also be combined with different C2 substituents on the indole 
129 
component to afford an array of different products; these are exemplified by the formation of biaryl compounds 
130 
bearing bromo 3ae (54 yield, 955 e.r. ), methoxy 3af (82 yield, 928 e.r. ), aryl 3ag (45 yield, 955 e.r.) and 
131 
alkyl 3ah (66 yield, 937 e.r.) groups. 132
