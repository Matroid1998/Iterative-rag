Description:
Materials that exhibit fluctuations close to a Mott metal-insulator transition.

There is no literature consensus about what exactly it means for a manyelectron system to
be strongly correlated.24 Leading notions include the following
1. The wavefunction cannot qualitatively be described by a single Slater determinant, and
is multiconfigurational. A chemical example is when two states of different character
 e.g., ionic and covalent configurations that can be nonorthogonal along much of a dis
sociation coordinate  are of competing significance (energetically nearly degenerate).5
Another example from physics of such an intermediate regime involves fluctuations in
materials such as transition metal oxides close to a Mott metalinsulator transition6
or fblock compounds,7 in which electrons hesitate between delocalized (wavelike)
and localized (particlelike) character.4
2. The twobody interaction is large relative to onebody terms in the Hamiltonian.
