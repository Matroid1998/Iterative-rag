Description:
A pyridine-ligated compound that only returns unreacted material in the reaction.

Interestingly, Bi(4OMeEtbipy)HVI provided the product in much lower yields in comparison 
to Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI (entry 7). This revealed that electronic effects within the bipyridine 
ligand might play a crucial role in the efficiency of the oxidation. It was also interesting to note 
that the reaction employing pyridineligated PhI(O)(Py)2(OTf)2 only returned unreacted
