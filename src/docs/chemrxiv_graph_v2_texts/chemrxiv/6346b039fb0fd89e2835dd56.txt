Description:
A polar group that contributes to a large molecular electric dipole moment when oriented parallel to the molecule's long axis.

24 This socalled 
ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase displays properties distinct from those of the conventional apolar 
nematic ferroelectricity, with large spontaneous polarisation; 3, 9 polar domains; 9 strong nonlinear 
optical response; 10 unique electrooptic responses; 11 thermal gradientinduced circular motion of 
particles. 12 Progress in understanding and exploiting the unique physics of the NF phase is reliant on 
the design and synthesis of new materials, with significant progress in the since the report of the first 
polar nematic materials in 2017. 7, 8, 1321 The NF materials reported to date are exclusively rodlike, 
with polar groups (for example nitro, fluoro, cyano, esters, difluoromethoxy) oriented such that there is 
a large molecular electric dipole moment which is oriented close to parallel to the molecules long axis.
