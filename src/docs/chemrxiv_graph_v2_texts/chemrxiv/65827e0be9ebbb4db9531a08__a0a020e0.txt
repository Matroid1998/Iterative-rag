Description:
An organic ligand used in coordination chemistry.

Text:
The example of organic or metal
loligands includes 2,4,6tri4pyridyl1,3,5triazine,16,19,20 or 
metalloligands with ferrocene,21 or ruthenium tris(1,10phe
nanthroline) moieties.22 Regarding the redoxactive metal 
node of MOPs, one can select it from a library of redox
active metal complexes, which allows for the choice of var
ious ligand types and the design of the resulting geometry 
of MOPs. However, MOPs with redoxactive metal nodes
