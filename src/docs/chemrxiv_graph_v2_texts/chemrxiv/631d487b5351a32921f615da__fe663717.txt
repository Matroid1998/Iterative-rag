Description:
A simple ring structure that forms part of the nucleobases in DNA and RNA.

One of the fundamental questions on the origins of life lies in the current style of the
genetic code seen on Earth. DNA and RNA adopted nucleobases, which are the build
ing blocks of nucleic acids, as the unit of the code, ATCG for DNA and AUCG for RNA. The structures are categorized into two kinds of molecules pyrimidine bases, including
cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U) and purine bases, including guanine (G), and
adenine (A). A pyrimidine base, a simple ring structure, is bounded by hydrogen bonds to
a purine base, a fusedring structure to form a complementary pair and deliver the genetic
information in DNA and RNA.

Description:
A type of nucleobase that can be found in meteorites.

Why had nature selected the molecules with the simple
combination of ring and fusedring structures as the genetic code? They would have been
dominant in a certain period in the Earth through the chemical evolution starting from
prebiotic conditions. The other source of pyrimidine basis would be extraterrestrial, and
several nucleobases were detected from meteorites as well as amino acids. The chemi
cal evolution of the prebiotic molecules outside the Earth would be an essential topic to
disentangle the mystery of the origin of life. Uracil is the rst pyrimidine nucleobase found in carbonaceous meteorites1, behind
the detection of purine nucleobases, adenine, and guanine2. The tendency of nucleobases
in meteorites and possible reactions have been discussed3.
