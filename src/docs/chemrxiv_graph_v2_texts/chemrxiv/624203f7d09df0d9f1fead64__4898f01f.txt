Description:
A ring structure with five rings.

The diversity is 
attributed to the fact that, although carbohydrates are only made up of 20 common 
monosaccharides, they may be linked together via five potential positions. Additionally, there are 
two possible anomeric configurations ( and ) and some monomer units have different ring sizes 
(e.g., furanose has five rings whilst pyranose has six 1012. This gives rise to numerous 
carbohydrate isomers and therefore, a complete structural characterization of carbohydrates 
would require information on linkage, branching, as well as anomeric configuration. Threedimensional geometric assignments of carbohydrate structures can be obtained 
from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 1315 or crystallography 10, 15, 16 
These techniques are limited in providing a highthroughput analysis 10, 15.
