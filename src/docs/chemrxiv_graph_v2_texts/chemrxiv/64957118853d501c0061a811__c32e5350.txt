Plasticizers associated with various adverse health effects and increased regulatory scrutiny.

The building and construction sector is a major industrial user of plastics, particularly polyvinyl 
51 
chloride (PVC)  in Europe 71 of PVC is used in this sector, contributing to 38 of all plastics 
52 
used in the sector.1,2 Many chemical substances are present in plastics, including residual 
53 
monomers, additives, processing aids, and socalled nonintentionally added substances (NIASs) 
54 
such as contaminants, byproducts, and breakdown products.3,4 PVC plastics have been notorious 
55 
for their (earlier) extensive use of hazardous additives therein, such as orthophthalates, cadmium, 
56 
lead, and tin as PVC requires extensive plasticization (565 weight) as well as heat and UV 
57 
stabilization (0.055 weight).5,6 In recent years, the use of additives in PVC are shifting, e.g., 
58 
from some wellknown hazardous plasticizers and stabilizers to alternative ones.7 
59 
Orthophthalate plasticizers have been associated with various adverse health effects, including 
60 
lower semen quality, altered anogenital distance, endometriosis, decreased testosterone, 
61 
neurodevelopmental effects, ADHD, autism, development of breastuterinetesticular cancers, 
62 
asthma, and type 2 diabetes, leading to increased regulatory scrutiny.8,9 For example, 
63 
bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP, CASRN 117817) was added to the Authorisation List of the 
64 
EUs Chemicals Regulation, REACH, in 2013, and a groupbased regulation for all ortho
65 
phthalates may be expected in the coming years.10 Phaseout of some orthophthalates has led to 
66 
an increased demand for alternative plasticizers including terephthalates, trimellitates, cyclohexane 
67 
dicarboxylic acid esters, phosphates, adipates, citrates, vegetable oil derivatives, and polymeric 
68 
plasticizers (see section S1 in Supporting Information (SI) 1) 7,11.

Description:
Alternative plasticizers that are generally less well-studied.

Text:
Currently, available hazard data 
69 
indicate that these alternative plasticizers are likely safer than orthophthalates, but they are 
70 
generally less wellstudied, including a lack of important physicochemical or toxicological data for 
71 
some of them.11 Nevertheless, at least tris(2ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP, CASRN 78422, 
72 
likely persistent), tricresyl phosphate (TCP, CASRN 1330785, likely toxic for reproduction), 
73 
and tris(2ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM, CASRN 3319311, likely persistent and endocrine 
74 
disrupting) have shown some cause for concern.11,12 
75 
PVC requires heat and UV stabilization, as it is intrinsically unstable due to molecular defects.5 
76 
Earlier stabilizer systems were mainly based on cadmium and lead, which are known for posing 
77 
health and environmental risks.13,14 The PVC industry in the EU voluntarily phased out cadmium 
78 
or leadbased stabilizer systems in 2001 and 2015, respectively, and replaced them with (organo) 
79 
tin, barium and calciumbased systems.7,15,16 Yet, some of these replacements may still lead to
