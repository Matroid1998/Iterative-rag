Description:
Contains ORR active sites at the edges of its layers.

Such a detailed understand
ing is a prerequisite for the systematic optimization of the prepara
tion methodology, targeting catalysts with high active site densities 
and turnover frequencies while avoiding catalyst degradation. According to Chung et al.,2 the ORR active sites are FeN4 centers 
at the edges of graphene layers and OHadsorbed intermediates are 
formed spontaneously at relevant potentials. Zitolo et al.27 attribute 
the ORR activity to two FeN4 sites based on fits to Kedge XAS 
data (EXAFS, XANES) albeit without firm assignment to Mss
bauer signatures one featuring two endon bound oxygen mole
cules, the other a sideon bound oxygen molecule.
