Description:
Known as fischesserite, it shares the chiral cubic I4132 space group and has a melting point around 730 C.

Text:
The exploration for precious metals in natural sources
led to the discovery of Ag3AuSe2 (fischesserite) and
Ag3AuTe2 (petzite) in the nature in the early 1900s.1,2
They were identified to have stoichiometric compositions
and share the chiral cubic I4132 space group, as deter
mined by Xray diffraction. Ag3AuS2 crystallizes in a
centrosymmetric trigonal structure3 and is not the focus
of this study. Early research on Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2 explored
structural transitions at high temperatures using dif
ferential thermal analysis (DTA) and Xray diffraction
(XRD).47 Both compounds have similar melting points
around 730 C and undergo multiple phase transitions at
elevated temperatures. Although synthesis of Ag3AuSe2
and Ag3AuTe2 have been reported,58 experimental data
on the physical and chemical properties of the synthetic
samples remain limited.

Description:
Predicted to have a narrow and direct band gap that can be tuned through strain application.

Text:
Theoretical work on Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2 pre
dicted narrow and direct gaps at the  point.8,16,17 Re
cent density functional theory (DFT) calculations ex
amined their potential applications in dark matter de
tection and highlighted the tunable band gaps through
strain application.17 Simulated band structures with
reduced lattice parameters demonstrated gapopening
for Ag3AuSe2 and gapclosing for Ag3AuTe2.17 Specif
ically, a full gap closure was predicted at 4 strain
for Ag3AuTe2.17 Our recent DFT simulations using
the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE) functional predicted
zero gap for the selenide at 3 tensile strain.18,19 These
findings suggest that alloying Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2
may induce gapnarrowing and potentially metallic be
havior at an intermediate strain between 3strained
Ag3AuSe2 and 4strained Ag3AuTe2.

Description:
A compound whose band gap can be tuned by substituting Se with Te.

Text:
In this study, we explore band gap tuning by chemical
substitution of Se2with larger Te2anions in Ag3AuSe2
to expand the unit cell. We investigated the synthesis
of Ag3Au(Se1xTex)2 with x from 0 to 1 and examined
their electrical and optical properties experimentally. II. METHODS
Ag3Au(Se1xTex)2 alloys with the tellurium fraction
x  0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9, and 1 were syn
thesized from elemental powders of Ag (99.9 metals
basis), Au (99.98 metals basis), Se (99.9999 metals
basis) and Te (99.8 metals basis). Powders were mixed
together in respective stoichiometric ratios and sealed in
evacuated silica ampules. Sealed ampules were annealed
at 800 C for 24 hours, followed by a slow cooling to room
temperature over 24 hours.
