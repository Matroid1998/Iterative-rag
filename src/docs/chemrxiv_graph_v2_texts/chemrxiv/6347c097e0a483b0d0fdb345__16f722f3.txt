Description:
Materials whose optical properties and stability can be finely tuned by partially exchanging the halide anion.

investigated how replacing the organic building block in the
negative gas adsorption (NGA) DUT49 material affects its adsorption behavior.5 They
found DUT50, with an elongated linker compared to DUT49, to exhibit both a higher
pore volume and a larger pore size compared to the parent material, while retaining the
fcu topology and the adsorptioninduced transition mechanism responsible for NGA in its
parent material.6 Similarly, (partially) exchanging the halide anion in cesium lead halide
perovskites is an often pursued approach to finely tune the optical properties and stability
of these materials.7,8 By replacing or even by removing entire building blocks in this way, a
combinatorially large versatility in hypothetical materials can be generatedeach of them
forming a potential contender for specific applications.
