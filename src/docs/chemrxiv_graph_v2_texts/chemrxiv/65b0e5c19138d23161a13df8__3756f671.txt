Description:
Quinone-based redox-active organic electrode materials with high theoretical specific capacity and ease of synthesis.

Text:
Their structures are adjustable and their electrochemical properties are tunable, they can have a 
high energy density and long cycling stability, and the solidstate diffusion of ions is not 
relevant in their performance. Among the quinonebased redoxactive organic electrode 
materials, pillarquinones and calixquinones are particularly attractive due to their high 
theoretical specific capacity (446 mAh g1) and ease of synthesis.5 Each parabenzoquinone 
panel in these macrocycles can be reduced by up to two electrons with concurrent uptake of 
metal cations from the electrolyte. In addition, these macrocyclic quinones possess a cavity and 
thus have intrinsic porosity, which can improve ion diffusion in the electrode.

Pillar5quinone 
(P5Q), for instance, features a cavity radius of 4.128  and therefore has low steric hindrance 
as well as high molecular symmetry.14 Both P5Q and calixquinones (calixnquinone, n  4, 6, 
and 8) have been investigated in Libased cells,1520 and recently, P5Q and C4Q were also 
investigated as positive electrodes in SIBs and other battery chemistries.2125 As these 
macrocyclic quinones in their neutral or reduced state are usually soluble in aprotic liquid 
battery electrolytes, which severely reduces their cycling stability, a mitigation strategy has to 
be applied. These strategies generally include carbon encapsulation, salt formation of the active
