Description:
Monomers used in ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) to synthesize polymers.

Text:
A versatile approach to synthesize sustainable sequence
defined polymers is to conjoin ringopening polymerization (ROP) of lactones and ring
opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxideheteroallene.1119 As an example, Williams 
and coworkers developed a stateoftheart switch catalysis strategy whereby a unimodal 
catalyst can switch between ROP and ROCOP to deliver block copolymers from mixed 
monomers.2023 The key is to construct robust catalysts capable of simultaneously adapting to 
the different mechanisms of ROP and ROCOP.
