Description:
Offers a high capacity of 147 mAh.g-1 due to the oxidation of Ni2 to Ni4 at an average potential of 4.7 V vs. LiLi.

Text:
Spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is one of the most promising and 
costeffective candidates for nextgeneration positive electrode 
materials for Liion batteries. This material offers a high capacity 
of 147 mAh.g1 due to the oxidation of Ni2 to Ni4 at an average 
potential of 4.7 V vs. LiLi, which results in an appealing energy 
density of 650 Whkg.1,2 However, some issues still prevent its im
plementation in commercial devices. Limited stability of electro
lytes at such high potentials leads to secondary reactions at the elec
trodeelectrolyte interface involving Mn dissolution into the elec
trolyte and cathode electrolyte interphase growth.3 A deep compre
hension and adjustment of its intrinsic properties are necessary to 
make LNMObased batteries available.

Description:
A spinel structure with Ni and Mn that can be disordered or ordered.

Text:
In LNMO spinel structure, Ni and Mn can occupy either a single 
crystallographic site or two different ones within cubic symmetry 
unit cells. The first unit cell is described in the Fd3m space group 
and associated with a disordered (statistical) distribution of transi
tion metal ions, whereas the second one is described in the P4332 
space group and associated with a 13 ordering between the two 
transition metal ions. The disordered LNMO is generally obtained 
via hightemperature solidstate syntheses ( 900C), inevitably 
next to a rocksalttype impurity such as NiO and LixNi1xO.4 The 
formation of this mixture of phases is driven by the oxygen loss 
from the stoichiometric phase LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 at such elevated tem
peratures.

Description:
Composed of LiNi20.5Mn3,41.5O4 and reannealed to form LiNi20.5Mn41.5O4.5 for stoichiometry and order.

Text:
This phenomenon also causes the partial reduction of 
Mn4 into Mn3 to balance the decreasing NiMn ratio within the 
spinel structure. Thus, the disordered LNMO is composed of 
LiNi20.5Mn3,41.5O4. The material is commonly reannealed at 
a lower temperature (700C) to homogenize it and reoxidize 
Mn3 into Mn4 to obtain the stoichiometric and ordered LNMO 
LiNi20.5Mn41.5O4.5 Regarding electrochemical performance, the 
disordered phase usually exhibits higher electronic conductivity 
due to manganese mixed valence, better structural stability and 
higher specific capacity, especially at high rates and for longterm 
cycling.6 As rocksalt impurity tends to be located at the surface of 
disordered phase primary particles,710 Not only does it hinder ac
cess to the full electrochemical capacity of spinel, but it also leads 
to misleading investigations of surface reactivity.

Description:
A spinel material whose electrochemical performance is influenced by particle morphology and surface orientations.

Text:
Particle morphology and surface orientations impact spinel 
LNMO energy storage performance 11 by influencing the electrical 
conductivity, Liion diffusion kinetics, and surface reactivity at the 
electrodeelectrolyte interface.12 Indeed, theoretical calculations 
have revealed that 111 surfaces show the lowest surface energy 
for spinel LNMO,13,14,favoring thus octahedral morphology. Addi
tionally, these 111 surfaces promote superior electrochemical 
performance due to larger atomic density and reduced transition 
metal dissolution compared to other surfaces, such as 110 and 
100 found on truncated octahedra.1518 For all the particle mor
phologies that can be experimentally obtained (octahedra, trun
cated octahedra, sphere, nanorods, platelets), one or two crystallo
graphic planes are usually exposed depending on the synthesis con
ditions.

Description:
Exhibits particle morphology as octahedra or truncated octahedra with exposed crystallographic planes of 111 or 100110.

Text:
For instance, conventional solidstate synthesis does not al
low the control of LNMO particle morphology or surface orienta
tion and always leads to octahedra or truncated octahedra with ex
posed crystallographic planes of 111 or 100110, respec
tively. LNMO with platelet morphology reported in the literature 
revealed, until now, either 10011019,20 or 11216,2123 crys
