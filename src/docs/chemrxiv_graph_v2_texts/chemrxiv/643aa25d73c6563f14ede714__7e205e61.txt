Description:
A gas whose exposure at 100 ppm poses a direct threat to life and is subject to strict air quality standards.

Text:
Air contamination with this gas
is one of the causes of many respiratory (laryngitis, chronic bronchi
tis, respiratory tract infections), and cardiovascular diseases 14, 15. Exposure of a human organism to a concentration of SO2 equal to 100
ppm is related to a direct threat to life 1618. The maximum expo
sure can not exceed 175 ppb per 10 minutes and 2 ppm per 10hour
time period according to air quality standards 17. The harmful effect
of SO2 on human health and the environment combined with its high
emissions makes its rapid detection one of the challenges of modern
science. In particular, novel materials, including nanomaterials, with
the potential to improve SO2 detection have been in the area of interest
of researchers in recent years.

Description:
Detected using low-cost and high-sensitivity environmental gas detectors.

Text:
TMD gassensing platforms appear to be an attrac
tive alternative to devices based on metal oxide semiconductors (MOS)
that have been widely investigated in recent years in the context of
SO2 detection 2227. The latter are important lowcost and high
sensitivity environmental gas detectors, but are known for problems
with detection at room temperature and relatively high power consump
tion. Simultaneously, a growing number of promising reports on effec
tive detection at room temperature using TMDbased sensors has re
cently emerged in the literature 2831. Individual TMD sheets have a
threelayer structure reflected in their chemical formula, which is MY2. A single sheet consists of two chalcogen layers (Y) and a transition
metal layer (M) sandwiched between them.
