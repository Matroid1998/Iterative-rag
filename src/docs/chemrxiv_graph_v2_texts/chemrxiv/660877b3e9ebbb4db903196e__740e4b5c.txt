Description:
Used in the synthesis of monoethanolamine, associated with substantial CO2 emissions.

Text:
In these technologies, aminebased solvents, particularly monoethanolamine (MEA), stand
out for their remarkable CO2 solubility, low viscosity, and satisfactory thermal stability 24. How
ever, MEAbased processes often require signicant energy for solvent recovery, and they are prone
to considerable solvent losses and potential equipment corrosion due to the presence of SO2 and O2
in the ue gases 50. Additionally, the synthesis of MEA from ammonia is, in itself, associated with
substantial CO2 emissions; this affects the overall lifecycle CO2 emissions of the capture process
26. Research also indicates that MEAbased processes have impacts on human toxicity and water
eutrophication 45.
