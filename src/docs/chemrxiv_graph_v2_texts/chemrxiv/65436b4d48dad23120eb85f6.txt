cals,3436 the development of a straightforward and greener pro
tocol for derivatizing amino acids and peptides would be worth
while. To this end, we envisioned an MLassisted approach to iden
tify a suitable triarylborane that is able to efficiently catalyze 
the reductive alkylation of amino acids and peptides with H2 
through the construction of an insilico library that includes a 
variety of unprecedented triarylboranes. Moreover, through the 
construction of this insilico library, we aimed to contribute to 
the structural diversification of triarylboranes beyond the arche
typical B(C6F5)3,3740 which should expand the utility of this 
compound class in catalysis, materials science, and other areas. It should be noted that Dyson and Corminboeuf et al. have
