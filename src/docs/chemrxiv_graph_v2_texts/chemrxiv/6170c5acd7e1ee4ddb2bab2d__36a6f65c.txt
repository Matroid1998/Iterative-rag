Description:
Involved in the transport mechanism within Na4V2(PO4)3, moving through Na(1) and Na(2) pathways.

Text:
At 
maximum, the Na(1) and Na(2) sites (of different multiplicities) can respectively generate 
one and three Na positions per formula unit, thus leading to the final stoichiometry 
Na4V2(PO4)3. During electrochemical reactions, although the Na(1) site is involved in the 
global Naion transport mechanism (Na(2)  Na(1)  Na(2) pathways), it tends to be almost 
fully occupied regardless of the total Na content into the material, whereas the Na(2) site is 
partiallyfully emptied or filled depending on the compositions.8,9,1416
