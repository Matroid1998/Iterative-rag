Description:
Forms analogues known as BODIPY.

Text:
There is a continuous competition between 
the 1 electronic transitions upon photoexcitation or the charge 
separated states formation which is modulated by the polarity of 
the environment polarity. Focusing on the dipyrrinato complexes with Group 13 
elements, the boron analogues (BODIPY, 2) are the most famous 
dipyrrin 
chelates 
due 
to 
their 
facile 
preparation
