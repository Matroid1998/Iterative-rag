Description:
Utilized via transiently generated imines for C(sp3)H functionalization.

Text:
Yu and coworkers were able to extend their seminal carbox
amidedirected C(sp3)H arylation of cyclopropanes to the corre
sponding cyclobutane frameworks.7ac Subsequent advances enabled 
the deployment of native carboxylic acids,7d ketones (via transiently 
generated imines)7e and oximes7f as directing groups for a selection 
of C(sp3)H functionalization reactions, many of which could, again, 
be rendered enantioselective using a range of ligandcontrolled strat
egies.
