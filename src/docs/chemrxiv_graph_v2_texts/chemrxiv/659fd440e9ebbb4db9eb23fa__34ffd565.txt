Description:
A motif found in biologically and medicinally relevant molecules.

Text:
Accordingly, the alkyl 2azinyl amine motif can be found in a variety of biologically and medicinally relevant molecules 
(Fig. 1A). For example, introduction of the amine moiety to a 2alkylpyrimidine scaffold enabled improved physical 
properties and cell permeability for an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV1) integrase, which led to 
the identification of a potentially clinically useful antiretroviral agent.5 Despite broad interest in the alkyl 2azinyl amine 
feature, the availability of surprisingly few general and concise methods for their preparation appears to have hindered 
their wider utilization.
