Description:
Considered as a potential catalyst for industrial photocatalysis.

Text:
Iron oxides, among the many other earthabundant mineral oxides, have been closely involved in 
the origin and evolution of life on Earth.1 Naturally, they occur as polymorphic mineral oxides and 
can show a rich structural anisotropy.2 This inherently enables them to demonstrate a wide range 
of physical and chemical properties. Also, their interaction with broadspectrum sunlight is of 
significance to various geochemical and industrial processes. Recently, the hematite (FeO) and 
magnetite (FeO) are being considered again as a potential catalyst for industrial photocatalysis.

Description:
Used in water splitting and photocatalysis due to its abundance, chemical stability, and nontoxicity.

Text:
However, beyond the initial success of the hematite (FeO) in water splitting and photocatalysis, 
this importance is primarily attached to their abundance, chemical stability, and nontoxicity.3 
Nonetheless, their inherent and often dramatic polymorphism and anisotropy can be hampering as 
well as a guiding factor for their photocatalytic behaviour. Furthermore, the origin of this 
polymorphism and anisotropy during their laboratory synthesis have hardly been fully understood 
and controlled.4 Also, how this mineralsubstrate based interfacial structure, of industrial and 
geochemical importance, is fundamentally related to their electronic structure, band gap, (Eg), light 
absorption coefficient (), charge dynamics (eh), and electron (e) transfer is also not yet fully 
understood.5 The foundational theoretical formulation related to this is constantly evolving.6 Thus, 
much remains unknown on such aspects of these oxides.
