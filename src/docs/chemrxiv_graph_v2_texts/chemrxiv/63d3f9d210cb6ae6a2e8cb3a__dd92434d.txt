Description:
A nonclassical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor with high efficacy and selectivity for tumor-associated isoenzymes CA IX and CA XII.

Text:
(McDonald, Chafe, Supuran,  Dedhar, 2022) The classic CA inhibitors contain the 
sulfonamide pharmacophore and have been determined to exhibit potent CA IX and XII inhibition with high 
potency to attenuate cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Examples of this class include acetazolamide, 
dichlorphenamide and dorzolamide (Table 1). (Supuran, 2008) Recently, coumarinbased small molecules (1.1 
and 1.2) were reported as nonclassical CA inhibitors with high efficacy and selectively for the physiologically 
dominant tumorassociated isoenzymes CA IX and CA XII. (Maresca et al., 2010; Supuran, 2008, 2020; Thacker, 
Alvala, Arifuddin, Angeli,  Supuran, 2019; Touisni et al., 2011; Williams  Gieling, 2019) Carbonic anhydrase 
inhibitors with combined sulfonamide and coumarin moieties have been reported to possess high efficacy for 
inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CA IX (1.31.7, Table 1).
