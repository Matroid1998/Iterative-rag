Description:
A ligand used in the formation of lanthanide(III) complexes for bioimaging.

Text:
Kinetically inert lanthanide(III) complexes based on lig
ands derived from cyclen and TACN have been used in 
many forms of bioimaging and diagnostics.113 Less stable 
DTPA, cryptands, and siderophorebased ligand systems 
are also prevalent.14, 15 A common denominator in many of 
these systems, especially the macrocyclic systems, is that 
they adopt several forms with different chirality in solu
tion.1620 However, when a chiral agent is added, the equi
librium between the different isomers may be perturbed.11, 
2125 This is important, as biological systems are inherently 
chiral.

Description:
A rigid macrocycle used to achieve complexes with resolved chirality.

Text:
Any use of these lanthanide(III) complexes in bio
logical applications will either favor a specific form or cre
ate a number of new forms by interaction between two or 
more molecules with more than one chiral element.9, 12, 26 
The inherent chirality of biomolecules was recently used 
by Parker to develop responsive molecules. Using the rigid 
TACN macrocycle, complexes were achieved with a re
solved chirality, and the specific handedness controlled the 
binding of the complex to specific biomolecules.9 
Here, we have mimicked the influence of biological chi
rality by adding additional chiral elements to the lantha
nide complex itself. Specifically, ligand systems were made 
with diastereomeric pendant arms. The resulting kinet
ically inert lanthanide(III) complexes thus contained four 
chiral elements.
