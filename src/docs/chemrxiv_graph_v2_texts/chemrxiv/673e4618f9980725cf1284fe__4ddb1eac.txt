Description:
Super ionic conductor structures with great structural stability and high ionic conductivity for sodium ions.

Text:
The requirements of those can, on the
other hand, be met by a variety of battery types. NASICON sodium (Na) super ionic conductor structures exhibit great structural stabil
ity and high ionic conductivity  especially for sodium ions.8 They belong to the family of
superionic conductors, which are materials that display exceptionally high ionic conductivity
at or near room temperature.9 Furthermore, they are classied as a polyanionic compounds,
