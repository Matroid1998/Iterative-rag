Description:
Play a crucial role during the formation of the mesostructure in the cooperative template method and condense around preformed mesophases in the liquid crystal templating mechanism.

The self
assembly along with the solvent is then calcinated at high temperature which induces pore in the 
system 4. MSMs are prepared using either the cooperative template method 5, where the 
silicates play a crucial role during formation of the mesostructure; or the liquid crystal templating 
mechanism 6, where the structure of preformed surfactant liquid crystals determines the MSM 
structure, while silicates simply condense around these preformed mesophases. The composition 
and type of the surfactants, auxiliary chemicals, and the synthetic condition allows us to monitor 
the desirable pore size, wall thickness, and pore shape. Understanding and controlling interfacial 
interactions, association, and aggregation is vital to the goaloriented use of MSMs.
