GroupIII sesquioxides exhibit a pronounced polymorphism13 and, specically In2O3 and
Ga2O3 form widebandgap (WBG) and even ultrawidebandgap (UWBG) semiconductors
(in the case of Ga2O3) with promising properties for applications in optoelectronics and
power electronics.48 Energy gaps ranging from 2.3 to 3.7 (In2O3) or from 4.4 to 5.3 eV
(Ga2O3) with a strong absorption onset at around 3.6 eV (In2O3) make these materials
transparent in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible wavelengths region.1,2,9 Together with ndoping
and high electrical conductivity,4,10 this unusual combination of high optical transparency
and electrical conductivity places them in a very special class of materials of interest called
transparent conducting oxides (TCOs).2,11
Five polymorphs of Ga2O3 comprising rhombohedral corundum (), monoclinic (), de
fective spinel (), bodycentered cubic bixbyite (), and orthorhombic or hexagonal ()
phases12,13 are reported.
