Text:
Diarylethene derivative is one of the photochromic compounds expected to exhibit 
photomechanical crystal shape changes in the solid states under irradiation with ultraviolet 
(UV) light.1 Crystal morphologies such as rod and ribbonshaped crystals can affect the 
photomechanical bending 2 and twisting 3. In the fabrication of such photomechanical 
crystals, the crystallographic growth orientations, associated with the crystal morphologies, 
require precisely controlling in the preparation process. The morphological control of these 
diarylethene crystals has been challenging for the conventional simple methods such as slow
