Introduction
This research papers hypothesis is that the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) will
increase with the use of the catalysts of MnO2, PbO2, and Fe2O3, with MnO2 having the highest
catalytic activity and inhibiting the fastest rate of decomposition of Hydrogen peroxide, measured with
the fastest rate of oxygen production.
