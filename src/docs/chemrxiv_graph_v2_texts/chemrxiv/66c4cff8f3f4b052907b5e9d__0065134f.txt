Description:
Used as a catalyst in the homogeneous dehydroaromatization of higher alkanes.

Text:
How
ever, homogeneous dehydroaromatization of higher alkanes has been demonstrated using a
molecular iridium catalyst 11. Homogeneous methane activation reactions are of great interest because they offer several
potential advantages over heterogeneous processes, including the stabilization of products
through solvation effects, a variety of effective heat management strategies, lower reaction
temperature, greater control of the reaction mechanism, and improved selectivity 12. The
high reactivity of transition metal complexes has enabled considerable advances in homo
geneous activation of methane in synthetic chemistry over the years, from the latter half of
the 20th century onwards. 13, 8, 1315.
