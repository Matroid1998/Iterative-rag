Description:
Limited pool of canonical hydrophobic types with side chains differing in structure and volume.

Text:
The preferential interaction between apolar solutes in water 
the hydrophobic effect  is a key factor driving protein fold
ing1,2, structural stability with respect to changes in tempera
ture3,4 (thermal stability) and interactions with other proteins
and ligands5,6. The hydrophobic effect reects the balance be
tween solutewater interactions and direct, predominantly dis
persive, solutesolute interactions7,8. Understanding how to use
amino acid mutations to control the hydrophobic effect is crit
ical to develop new proteinbased drugs, biodevices and mate
rials913. Simultaneously, minimizing changes in solutesolute
packing upon mutations is desirable to ensure that protein struc
ture  and thus function  is preserved14,15. This is, however, dif
cult with the limited pool of canonical hydrophobic amino acids
because their side chains differ in structure and volume.
