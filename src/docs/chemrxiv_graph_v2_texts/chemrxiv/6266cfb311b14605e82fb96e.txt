Description:
Absorbs visible and near infrared light when electrochemically reduced, making it suitable for electrochromic window technologies.

Text:
Electrochemical 
charging and discharging modulates the optical properties in response to a potential bias, resulting in 
reversible coloring and bleaching.1 By controlling the transmittance of solar radiation, we can limit 
unwanted heating and regulate natural lighting, improving building energy efficiency.24 Both amorphous 
and crystalline forms of tungsten oxide absorb visible and near infrared light when electrochemically 
reduced, making it one of the most heavily studied materials for electrochromic window technologies.5,6 
More recent research has shown that nanocrystalline forms of tungsten oxide demonstrate localized surface 
plasmon resonance (LSPR), allowing selective optical modulation in the near infrared.7,8 LSPR is a 
property of conductive nanoparticles where the free charge carriers oscillate collectively in resonance with 
the electric field of incident light, leading to strong absorption.9 This absorption occurs throughout the 

2 

infrared for various conductive metal oxides, making it ideal for controlling the transmittance of infrared 
light in solar radiation.9
