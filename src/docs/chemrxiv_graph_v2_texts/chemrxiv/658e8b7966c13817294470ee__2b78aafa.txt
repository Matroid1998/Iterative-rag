Description:
A copolymer used as the polymeric matrix in photosensitive PPCs.

Materials and methods 
To prepare the novel photosensitive PPCs we used the photoconductive naphthalimide
containing copolymer poly(4(1,3dioxo1Hbenzodeisoquinolin2(3H)yl)phenyl 
methacrylatecononyl methacrylate (CoNaphNMA) as the polymeric matrix of the PPCs, and 
the symmetric CPDs 13 as sensitizers of photoconductivity (Scheme 1)
