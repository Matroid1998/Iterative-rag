Description:
A nonferrous material used in industries for high strength to lightweight welds.

Before the invention of Friction Stir Welding, a mechanical fastener was the key element for 
joining aluminum and its alloy material in different aircraft structural parts. For instance, the 
Eclipse Aviation industry, to manufacture Eclipse 500 business class aircraft, approximately 
used 7,300 rivets per airframe (fuselage). After all this economic loss, Wayne Thomas and 
his friends at The Welding Institute (TWI) of Cambridge, UK, invented Friction Stir Welding 
in 1991 1, 2. FSW is categorized under the solidstate welding process and widely used to 
join nonferrous materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper structures across many 
industries where a high strength to lightweight welds are required 37.
