Description:
A compound transformed into pyridine using dichlorocarbene as a carbon source.

Text:
A classic example of this ap
proach is the CiamicianDennstedt rearrangement, which trans
forms pyrrole into pyridine using dichlorocarbene as a carbon 
source and KOtBu as a base.20 Recently, Xu and coworkers in
troduced a similar reaction using 1,1dibromoalkane derivatives 
and LiOtBu to incorporate diverse functional groups.18 
Carbenoids stabilized by N2groups have also been employed 
as a carbon source in this reaction manifold.

Description:
A heterocyclic aromatic organic compound with a five-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.

Text:
For 
instance, ring expansion of pyrrole to pyridine is solely reported 
for metainsertion, where a carbon atom is inserted into the 
metaposition of a nitrogen atom.1822 Levin and coworkers
