NMR Chemical Shifts
36
NMR chemical shifts are valuable in the structure elucidation of organic compounds within
37
classical and computerassisted frameworks.15 Carbon chemical shifts have been used to
38
elucidate reaction products6, metabolites7, and natural products, including in the revision
39
of the structures.810 Furthermore, chemical shifts carry information about the local chem
40
ical environments of atoms and have been used as descriptors for predicting chemical re
41
activity11,12 and in QSARQSPR models13. Prediction of carbon chemical shifts from the
42
molecular structure has been extensively studied and many methods have been developed,
43
ranging from ab initio to fully datadriven methods.14,15
44
Predicting carbon NMR shifts from molecular structures from the first principles is com
45
putationally intensive.
