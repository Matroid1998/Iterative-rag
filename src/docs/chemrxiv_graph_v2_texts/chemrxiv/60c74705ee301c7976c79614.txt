Description:
An inert gas used in collision-activated dissociation experiments in mass spectrometry.

Text:
Tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) is a powerful analyti
cal tool that is used extensively for the characterization of 
complex mixtures in many fields, such as proteomics, petrole
omics, and drug discovery.14 Currently, the most commonly 
used MSMS technique to obtain structural information for 
ionized and isolated mixture components is collisionactivated 
dissociation (CAD).5,6 In these experiments, the analyte ions 
are accelerated and allowed to collide with an inert gas, such 
as helium. Upon the collisions, part of the kinetic energy of 
the ions is converted into their internal energy, resulting in 
fragmentation.
