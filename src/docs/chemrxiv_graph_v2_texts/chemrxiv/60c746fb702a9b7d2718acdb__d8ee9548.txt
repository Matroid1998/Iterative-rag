(Scheme 1a).3 Although cyclobutanone derivatives are known to be 
relatively stable and in some cases are commercially available, cy
clopropanones often decompose instantly at room temperature, as 
they are kinetically unstable to heat, light and moisture.4 The most 
common decomposition pathways involve either polymerization 
(heat and moistureinduced), decarbonylation to alkenes (light
induced), or nucleophilic ringopening as in the Favorskii rear
rangement.5 Nevertheless, cyclopropanone itself has been previous
ly prepared by reaction of diazomethane with ketene at 78 C 
followed by distillation at the same temperature,6 affording an ethe
real solution that must be used immediately at low temperature.
