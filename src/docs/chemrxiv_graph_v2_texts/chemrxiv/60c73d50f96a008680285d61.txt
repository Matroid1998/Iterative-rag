Description:
Represents the most studied multivalent ion from a guest-species perspective.

Intercalation is the reversible insertion of a guest species into a solid host structure such that
the host maintains its basic structural features.13 The host structure is therefore described
as a breathing matrix,4 and it can be an insulator, semiconductor, or a metal.1 Transition
metal oxides (TMO) are particularly interesting because they have been extensively studied
as cathode candidates for highenergydensity secondary batteries since the 1970s.1,3,57 Lith
ium has been the dominant intercalation ion,1 and the eorts led to the now widespread
use of the Liion technology as rechargeable batteries.3 TMOs are typically divided into
layered and nonlayered materials.3 In the latter, there exists usually a size limitation for the
intercalating atom.1 Because the magnesium ion has a comparable size to Li, Mg2 inter
calating into TMOs has been considered since the early 1990s8 as a promising alternative to
the Liion technology in order to increase energy density, address safetytoxicity concerns,
and reduce costs.9 Hence, magnesium arguably represents the most studied multivalent ion
from a guestspecies perspective.
