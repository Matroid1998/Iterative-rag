Exhibits low or nonbiodegradability, brittleness, and insolubility.

Text:
In general, TE 
scaffolds are designed to be nanoporous, electroconductive, and biodegradable structures that 
can provide temporary support for tissue regeneration1821. However, a critical challenge lies in 
the fact that PEDOTs, along with many other CPs, exhibits low or nonbiodegradability, 
brittleness, and insolubility22, 23. These factors limit the standalone use of PEDOTs or other 
CPs as TE scaffolds. Extensive efforts have been made to address the limitations encountered in the 
fabrication of tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds. Accordingly, PEDOT has been incorporated 
into biodegradable polymer matrices having high mechanical strength, biodegradability, and
