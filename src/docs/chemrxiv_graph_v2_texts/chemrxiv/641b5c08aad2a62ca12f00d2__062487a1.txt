Description:
Used as a precursor in the synthesis of several commercial drugs such as analgesics, antiemetics, and antipsychotics.

Text:
Understanding electrochemical CN coupling would enable selective synthesis of chemicals such 
as urea, methyl amine, acetamide, and benzamide, which is used as a precursor in the synthesis 
of several commercial drugs such as analgesics, antiemetics, antipsychotics, etc. The objective of 
the current study is a selective electrochemical synthesis of urea from NO3 and CO2.
