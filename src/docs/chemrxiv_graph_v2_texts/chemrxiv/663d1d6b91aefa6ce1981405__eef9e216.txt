Description:
Studied in forms such as bilayer graphene and two-dimensional graphene heterostructures.

Text:
For the carbonbased materials, the Raman spectroscopy is a particularly wellsuited technique (Zhang et al., 
2022), due to the longrange crystalline vibrations and shortrange molecular vibrations of carbon species, which 
are producing, for the different materials, their characteristic spectral fingerprints. According to Zhang and 
coworkers, these fingerprints allow identifying the specific carbon materials including graphite, diamond, graphene, 
carbon nanotubes, fullerene, and amorphous carbon. To these materials, we must also add the recent studies on 
graphene, bilayer graphene, and twodimensional graphene heterostructures (Zhang et al., 2022, Mu and Sun, 
2020, Cui and Sun, 2021). We have already discussed diamond and graphite Raman spectra in the framework of their decomposition in q
Gaussian Tsallis functions.

Description:
A material whose spectra are analyzed to understand its fingerprint components.

Text:
In Claramunt et al., 2015, we can find a different notation where D is D1, D2 is D, D3 is 
D and D4 is D. In Sousa et al., 2020, a further D5 component is used (see for instance the Raman spectrum 
decomposition in their Figure 2). Sadezky and coworkers give the following Raman shifts (cm1) 1580 (G), 1350 
(D1), 1620 (D2), 1500 (D3), 1200 (D4). Let us add 1700 (D5), according to Sousa et al., 2020. Here, our aim is that of showing spectra of graphene and graphene oxide, with respect to the graphite spectrum, to 
understand how many components are required to interpret the fingerprints.

Description:
A two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms with significant technological potentials.

Text:
Graphene is a twodimensional 
honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms that is widely considered for theoretical and applies studies, and for its 
technological potentials. Raman spectroscopy is considered suitable to characterize it and its related materials 
(Childres et al., 2013). A large amount of information such as disorder, edge and grain boundaries, thickness, 
doping, strain and thermal conductivity of graphene can be obtained from the spectrum recorded under different 
physical conditions, as discussed by Childres and coworkers. It means that Raman fingerprints must be able to give
