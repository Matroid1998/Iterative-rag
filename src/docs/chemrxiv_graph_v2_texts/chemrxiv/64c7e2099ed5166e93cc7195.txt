Description:
A metal essential for manufacturing electric vehicles, buildings, and energy storage devices.

Text:
Ironmaking processes that do not generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed 
for netzeroemissions energy systems (1). Most emissions associated with iron and steel production result 
from stochiometric quantities of CO2 (1.5 kg CO2 per kg Fe) produced during reduction of iron oxide 
ores in blast furnaces (2, 3). Demand for steel is unlikely to decrease during decarbonization (4); immense 
quantities of iron and steel are needed for manufacturing electric vehicles, buildings with electrified 
heatingcooling systems (5), racking for solar panels, supports for wind turbines, and devices for grid scale 
energy storage (6). Today, steelmaking is responsible for 8 of global GHG emissions, comparable to all 
passenger vehicles combined (7).

Description:
A metal that requires alternate production methods to reduce carbon emissions.

Text:
Recycling of scrap metal can alleviate, but not eliminate, emissions due 
to metal production, because global demand is predicted to exceed the supply of scrap by about onethird 
(8). Thus, alternate methods of producing iron from ore are needed to ease the carbon emissions burden 
of the ongoing energy transition (3, 9). Electrochemical cells can support the direct electrification of chemical manufacturing and 
construction (914). The electrochemical reduction of iron oxide, using electricity sourced from low
carbon, renewable resources (i.e. wind turbines, solar panels, or hydroelectric dams), and subsequent
