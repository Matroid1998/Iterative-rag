Description:
A mononuclear species formed by metalloenzymes to activate methane.

While the abundance of natural gas has motivated the valorization of methane as an energy 
feedstock,1 direct use of methane for the production of highervalue chemicals like methanol is 
limited by the lack of successful strategies for selective partial methane oxidation.1, 2 A limiting 
factor is the high CH bond dissociation energy in methane compared to the partially oxidized 
products, which leads to overoxidation.36 Instead, energyintensive routes that first produce 
syngas from methane at very high operating temperatures and pressures are customarily used in 
industry.710 Living systems leverage metalloenzymes such as soluble methane monooxygenase 
(sMMO) to convert methane selectively into methanol under ambient conditions using molecular 
oxygen as the oxidant1113 by forming, for example, a mononuclear Fe(IV)O species that activates 
methane.1416 These metalloenzymes have inspired the design of synthetic homogeneous and 
heterogeneous catalysts for the direct conversion of methane to methanol via more energyefficient 
methods.1725 Nevertheless, no synthetic catalyst to date is capable of simultaneously achieving 
high conversions and selectivities as enzymes have, motivating a wider search of candidate 
catalysts.
