are excellent for catalyzing, electrocatalyzing, andor 
photocatalyzing oxidation reactions. Of these compounds, 
polyoxometalates (POMs) are of particular interest to us. They are a special class of metal (e.g., VV, MoV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, 
and WVI) oxide polyanion clusters bridged by oxygen atoms 
that form welldefined cluster frameworks with adjustable 
structures and tunable compositions.10,11 An enormous 
variety of wellcharacterized polyoxometalates exists and 
many of these can catalyze oxidation reactions, but, they 
often fall short as catalysts for reduction reactions. 1216 
In principle, onetoone sulfurforoxygen analogues of 
POMs, i.e. polythiometalates (PTMs), ought to be 
synthetically accessible.

Description:
Compounds that can be organized and used as heterogeneous catalysts for oxidation and reduction reactions.

Text:
We recently reported that Mo(VI)Rh(III)
based, Andersontype polyoxometalates can be controllably 
heterogenized, protected against sintering, even at 200oC, 
and employed catalytically for a representative, gasphase 
oxidation 
reaction, 
under 
thermally 
demanding 
conditions.17 Our approach was to site the POMs within size
matched pores of a hierarchically porous, metalorganic 
framework (MOF) such that periodic arrays of reactant
accessible, yet immobile, clusters are presented. Related 
work has been described for Keggin POMs, with the 
organized POMs then being deployed as heterogeneous 
catalysts for condensedphase oxidation reactions.18,19 We 
reasoned that similarly useful arrays of agglomeration
immune PTMs could be obtained by starting with pre
isolated POMs. The obtained arrays could then be deployed 
as heterogeneous catalysts for reduction reactions.
