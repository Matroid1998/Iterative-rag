Description:
Used as a support material when doped with nitrogen for PGM-based HOR catalysts.

argued that such a weakly hydrogenbonded interfacial solvation environment increased the 
energy barrier of protoncoupled electron transfer and slowed down the kinetics of HORHER 11. Jia et al. proposed that the strongly hydrogenbonded water with an oxygendown (O) 
conformation accelerated rate of HORHER by shuffling reaction intermediates through Grotthuss 
mechanism 1214. Despite the debate, tuning the interfacial water structures appears to be a 
promising new strategy to improve HOR catalysts. However, the interfacial watercatalyst 
interaction is largely noncovalent so it cannot be regulated by the electronic structures of catalysts 
11,14. Methods to manipulate such interactions has rarely been proposed 14. Here we report the discovery of a porous nitrogendoped carbon (pNC) as a superior support 
for PGMbased HOR catalysts.
