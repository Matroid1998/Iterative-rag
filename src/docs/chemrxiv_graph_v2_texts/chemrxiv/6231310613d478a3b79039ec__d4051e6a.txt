Description:
Reduced to form an intermediate under the influence of HCl and PdC with hydrogen.

Text:
of HCl and PdC under 
an atmosphere of H2 led to nitro group reduction to give 
intermediate 12. The PdC was then removed via filtration of 
the reaction mixture through a short plug of Celite. To this 
filtrate was then added heteroaryl chloride 4 and the mixture 
was allowed to react at 75 C for 16 h. Upon completion, the 
solution was basified to pH 8 with aqueous NH4OH and the 
precipitated Pyronaridine (9) was collected via filtration, 
washed with water, and isolated in an overall yield of 95 over 
3steps. Since pyronaridine is offered as its tetraphosphate salt, 
opportunities for further purification exist, although were not 
pursued in these studies.
