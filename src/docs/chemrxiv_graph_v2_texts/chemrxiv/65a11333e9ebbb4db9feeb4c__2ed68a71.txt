Description:
Compounds characterized by structural families and framework dimensionality.

The
review begins with a general overview of metal thiocyanates high
lighting characteristic trends. It then moves onto a description of
the chemistry of binary metal thiocyanates, describing first the
five structural families before summarising what is known about
the binary metal thiocyanates without reported crystal structures. The structures of the ternary metal thiocyanates are then de
scribed, being classified first by framework dimensionality and
then by characteristic structural features. The review concludes
with a brief summary and prospectus of the potential of inorganic
metal thiocyanate chemistry. 1.1
Structural chemistry
Thiocyanate is a rigid linear anion.
