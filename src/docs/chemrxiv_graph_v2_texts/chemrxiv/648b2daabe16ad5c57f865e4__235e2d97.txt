Description:
Typically used as the A layer in the synthesis of MXenes from MAX phases.

Text:
MXenes have attracted significant 
attention due to their coupled high volumetric capacitance4 and high electronic conductivity,5 
biocompatibility,6 electrochromic behavior,7 and optical absorption peaks in the UVNIR range;8 
this has led to their use in applications including electrochemical energy storage,9 biomedicine,10 
optoelectronics,11 and many others.12,13 
MXenes are commonly synthesized through selective chemical etching from precursor 
MAX phases, which have the general formula Mn1AXn, where the A layer is comprised of group 
1314 elements (typically, Al for MXene synthesis).
