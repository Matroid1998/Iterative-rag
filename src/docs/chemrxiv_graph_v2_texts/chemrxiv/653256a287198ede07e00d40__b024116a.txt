Two generalized approaches to using lignin as a starting material can be considered downstream 
fragmentation or depolymerization to obtain platform chemicals, and chemical transformation 
chains to functionalize lignin and expand its potential in reallife applications11. Chloromethylation 
is a basic organic chemistry reaction that opens wide opportunities for further functionalization of 
natural raw materials. Interest in this reaction was boosted in 2022 when the US Environmental 
Protection Agency Green Chemistry Award was given for the development of the greener 
chloromethyl furfural synthesis, a chemocatalytic approach to biorefining in pulp production and 
building multifunctional chemical platforms12. Lignins complex structure limits its use in highend applications, but modification can 
overcome this limitation and expand its range of applications.
