Promising as a proton-conducting inorganic.

Thus, a lower operating 
temperature is employed to avoid the excessive evaporation of water. However, lowering the operating temperature 
leads to CO poisoning of the catalyst 9. Thus, highly pure fuels are utilized to suppress catalyst poisoning, and water 
and temperature must be managed to alleviate the decrease in conductivity. These result in extra work and equipment, 
increasing the cost and decreasing energy efficiency. For this reason, much effort has been devoted to developing 
membranes to overcome the conductivity dependence on RH 1012. In particular, it has been demonstrated that 
inorganic particles in the membrane can adsorb moisture and retain it at high temperatures 13, 14. Therefore, an 
organicinorganic composite membrane is one solution to improve efficiency. Especially zirconium phosphate (ZrP) 
is promising as a protonconducting inorganic.
