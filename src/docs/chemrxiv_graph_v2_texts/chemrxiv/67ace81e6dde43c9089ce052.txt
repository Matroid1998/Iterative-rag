Description:
Decomposes under ultrasound to produce radicals, with implications for radical chemistry in medicine and environmental science.

Text:
Radicalbased reactions play a crucial role in many chemical and biological processes. Ultrasoundinduced cavitation is a powerful method for generating radicals by creating extreme 
local conditions within collapsing bubbles. This study explores how ultrasound enhances radical
driven pathways, using the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (HO) as a model reaction. The 
findings have implications for fields such as medicine and environmental science, where radical 
chemistry is essential. Methodology 
Experimental Setup 
A solution of hydrogen peroxide was subjected to sonication using a probe sonicator. The 
reaction was monitored for gas evolution and pH changes to assess radical activity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20250nx8j ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000085433101 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
