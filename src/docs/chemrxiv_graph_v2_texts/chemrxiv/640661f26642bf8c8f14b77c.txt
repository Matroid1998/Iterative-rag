Description:
A component of repeating disaccharides in HS, involved in glycosidic bonds cleaved by HPSE.

Text:
HPSE is the only known enzyme that cleaves the internal 
glycosidic bond between a glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residue and an Nsulfoglucosamine 
(GlcN(NS)) residue bearing a 3Osulfo or a 6Osulfo group 7. HS is a series of 
repeating disaccharides consisting of specific patterns of glucuronic acid and D
glucosamine that have been Nsulfated or Nacetylated, allowing HPSE to recognize 
and cleave. By releasing active carbohydrate framents by cleaving HS, HPSE changes 
the functionality of HSPGs, leads to ECM remodeling, and impacts downstream 
pathways activated by free HS. HPSE plays an essential role in cancer development, 
and has been suggested to be a potent driver of all hallmarks of cancers 8. The elevated 
activity of HPSE is also reported in various inflammatory diseases, autoimmune 
disorders 9.
