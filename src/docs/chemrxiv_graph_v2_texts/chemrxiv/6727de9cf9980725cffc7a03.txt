Recent advances in the chemistry of Frustrated Radical Pairs (FRPs) suggest that two radicals, 
24 
which cannot form a covalent bond between them, can yield products that are unachievable by 
25 
alternative approaches.1 The current knowledge postulate that the radicals in FRPs react in a 
26 
stepwise manner, i.e., each radical in the pair reacts independently from another. For example, 
27 
in a recent publication by Lin et al. in Nature, the authors demonstrated the remarkable 
28 
regioselective functionalization of aliphatic CH bonds using FRPs generated from disilazide 
29 
donors and an Noxoammonium acceptor.2 The radical generated from disilazide  abstracts the 
30 
hydrogen and the Noxoammonium radical reacts with the carbon centered radical. 31
