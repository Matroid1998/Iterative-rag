Transportation is currently the sector with the highest reliance on fossil fuels and accounts
for more than a third of global CO2 emissions.1 Despite increasing electrification of the
transport fleet, the vast majority of vehicles still use fossil fuelpowered internal combustion
engines (ICEs).2 It is therefore crucial to increase the efficiency of ICEs to ensure that fuel
consumption and the subsequent CO2 emissions are minimised.3 A major issue affecting
the efficiency of modern ICEs are deposits that form on metal surfaces inside the engine,
particularly those on the fuel injectors.4 These deposits have long been recognised as a
problem in dieselpowered compression ignition ICEs, where recent attention has focused
on internal injector deposits.5 Historically, injector deposits have been less of an issue for
gasolinepowered spark ignition ICEs with port fuel injection.4 The majority of new spark
ignition engines now use gasoline direct ignition technology, which can deliver higher power
output and better fuel economy than the port fuel technology, but at the expense of increased
particulate matter emissions.6 Another related problem with the widespread adoption of
gasoline direct ignition technology is that it has led to an increase in depositrelated issues
for gasolinepowered ICEs.4
It is well known that deposits can lead to a decrease in power and fuel economy, as well
as an increase in CO2 and pollutant emissions from ICEs.79 Recent studies have confirmed
that polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are major components of engine deposits formed in
diesel and gasoline direct injection engines.10,11 PAHs are formed from the breakdown of fuel
molecules through thermooxidation, which is followed by polymerization of the degradation
products.12,13 The PAH molecules, acting as deposit precursors, grow up to 800 Da10 and
agglomerate in the fuel until they become insoluble and are deposited onto metal surfaces.14
Likewise, the degradation processes can be accelerated by these surfaces within the engine.15
It is worth noting that the size of the PAH molecules is similar to those found in soot (239838
Da).16 Deposits contain a significant amount of oxygen when initially formed, which decreases
with time while their aromatic content and porosity increases.17
