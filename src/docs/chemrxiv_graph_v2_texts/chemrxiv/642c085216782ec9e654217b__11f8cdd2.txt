Description:
Species that can lead to the formation of reduced compounds due to redox incompatibility with nitro groups.

Indeed, the acidity of the protons  to the nitro 
group allows an easy functionalization of the allylic position 
using reactions that are mostly compatible with a large 
variety of functional groups such as the Henry and the 
Mannich reactions, the Knoevenagel condensation or the 
Michael addition just to name a few.7 This approach appeared 
slightly counterintuitive at first as there was evidence of 
redox incompatibility between the nitro group and diborane 
species leading to the formation of reduced compounds as 
shown by Niggemann8 and Wu9 (Figure 1. B). Nonetheless, by
