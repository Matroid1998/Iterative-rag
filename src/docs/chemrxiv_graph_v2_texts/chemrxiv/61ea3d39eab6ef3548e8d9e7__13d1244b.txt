Influences mercury sorption.

Text:
We also studied the influence of pH and sodium chloride 
81 
concentrations on mercury sorption, which provided an increased understanding of the scope 
82 
and limitations of this sorbent. These findings helped establish important guidelines for 
83 
deploying this unique mercury sorbent in remediation. 84
