Description:
Each photocatalyst has its limitations.

These photocatalysts can 
be classified as (i) carbonyl derivatives, including aromatic 
ketones,713 diacetyls,14 aldehydes,15 and neutral Eosin Y16
18, and (ii) inorganic oxide derivatives, including deca
tungstate anion (W10O324),1923 uranyl cation (UO22),24
25 and antimony oxo porphyrin complexes.26 However, 
each dHAT photocatalyst has its limitations. For example, 
aromatic ketones could easily undergo irreversible dimeri
zation during photoreaction, and therefore, a high photo
catalyst loading (up to a few equivalents relative to sub
strate) is generally required to compensate for the catalyst 
loss.27 Photoexcited W10O324 anion can abstract hydrogen 
from strong bonds, such as the CH bond in methane (BDE 
 105 kcalmol).2829 However, its chemistry is mainly re
stricted by the need for highly energetic UV light (400 
nm).
