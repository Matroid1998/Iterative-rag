Description:
Acts as a substrate with a tethered nucleophile attached to the silicon center.

The Wirth group developed an effective approach to the formation of 
nitrogen and oxygenasubstituted ketones through an internal umpolung strategy mediated by PhI(OAc)2 (Figure 
1b).7a Their strategy relied on the use of a tethered nucleophile, i.e., the nucleophile was attached to the silicon 
center of the enol ether substrate (Figure 1b). Importantly, they were able to extend the scope of the reaction to 
the synthesis of chiral asubstituted ketones when using chiral I(III) reagents. More recently, the Gulder group
