Description:
Clusters that undergo oxidation and degradation under (electro)oxidation conditions.

Jacob and coworkers
recently investigated the oxidation and degradation of
Pt clusters under (electro)oxidation conditions using
ReaxFF.13 They beneted from an intense parametriza
tion and validation eort in the past decade14 that is not
available for many metals and adsorbates. To reach a
more transferable description, a simpler functional form
is desired that is compatible with standard force elds. However, describing the interaction between two dier
ent classes of materials like a metallic nanoparticle on
one hand and liquid water on the other hand poses sev
eral challenges.
