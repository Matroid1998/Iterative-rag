Description:
A noble metal used in phosphorescent emitters.

Text:
Most phosphorescent emitters, however, 
contain noble metals such as platinum or iridium, among the scarcest elements on Earth.1
3 Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) offers a different yet equally appealing 
strategy to triplet harvesting where 100 IQE is also possible in the device. In TADF 
emitters, dark triplet excitons are thermally upconverted into emissive singlets via 
reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). RISC is possible when the energy gap, DEST, between 
the lowest lying singlet and triplet excited states is of the order of the thermal energy (ca. 0.02 eV), provided that spinorbit coupling (SOC) between the two states is non
negligible.
