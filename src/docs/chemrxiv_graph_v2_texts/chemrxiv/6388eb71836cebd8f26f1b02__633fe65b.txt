Description:
A framework that adsorbs CO and CO2, involving pyrazine and cyanide ligands.

We
report a detailed study of gas adsorption mechanism of CO
and CO2 in Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4 in the lowspin state by means
of neutron scattering techniques and densityfunctional the
ory calculations. We identified the two adsorption sites, on
top of the openmetal site and between the pyrazine rings,
and the most stable orientational configuration of the guest
molecules and the pyrazine ligands of the framework was
determined. The inelastic neutron scattering results as
sisted by DFT calculations, show signatures of a hindrance
of the pyrazine libration and the outofplane movement of
cyanide ligands when the gas is adsorbed. Together with the
computed binding energy and a molecular orbital analysis,
these results agree with a physisorption mechanism for both
gases.
