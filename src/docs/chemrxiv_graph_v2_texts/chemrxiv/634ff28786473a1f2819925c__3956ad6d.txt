Description:
A component of 3(2 pyridyl)4aza6helicene used in coordination-driven chiral architectures.

They are inherently chiral 
molecular 
architectures 
generated 
from 
orthofused 
(hetero)aromatic rings with extended conjugation, displaying, 
very strong chiroptical activity.2731 When decorated with 
coordinating units, they can react with a variety of metal ions and 
give access to a very rich diversity of coordinationdriven chiral 
architectures (chiral complexes with controlled topology and 
enhanced 
chiroptics, 
helicates, 
coordination 
polymers, 
supramolecular cages, etc).32,33 Through this strategy, fascinating 
chiralityrelated properties can be obtained, such as redox
triggered chiroptical switching, chiral sensing, or CP emission. However, generating helicenebased metalorganic 1D polymeric 
architectures remains challenging and very few examples are 
described in the literature.34 Recently, we have shown that 3(2
pyridyl)4aza6helicene (H6bpy) bearing a 2,2bipyridine
