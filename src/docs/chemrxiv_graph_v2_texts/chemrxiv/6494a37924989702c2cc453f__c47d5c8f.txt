Description:
Used as a surface coating with implications for directing and optimizing the orientation of the active NO group.

Text:
Moreover, the 
molecules are found to arrange with the NO either 
pointing directly upwards or downwards, perpendicular 
to the surface, suggesting preferential ordering of up to 
half of the NO groups in the molecular layer may be 
possible. The ability to direct and optimise the orientation 
of the active NO group could have significant 
implications for the use of TEMPO as a surface coating. Results and discussion. Surfacedependent growth of TEMPO polymers. It 
has been previously reported10 that TEMPO deposited 
by plasma polymerisation results in three distinct 
structures as shown in Figure 1b; the intact molecule 
(NO), damaged molecule (N), and a protonated structure 
(NH2), which are each expected to behave differently 
against bacteria.
