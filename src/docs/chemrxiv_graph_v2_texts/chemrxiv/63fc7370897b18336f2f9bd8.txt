A limiting factor for the application of singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) in highdensity data 
storage is the requirement for expensive liquid helium cooling for them to retain magnetic 
information.13 For the last two decades, lanthanide (Ln) complexes with highly axial ligand 
fields have been frequently targeted, as these can provide the highest effective barriers to 
magnetic reversal (Ueff) by stabilizing the most magnetic and destabilizing the least magnetic 
mJ states of selected Ln ions along the molecular anisotropy axis.413 Isolated dysprosocenium 
cations, Dy(CpR)2 (CpR  substituted cyclopentadienyl), and related derivatives, have 
recently provided SMMs with 100 s magnetic blocking temperatures (T100) that are 
tantalizingly close to what can be achieved with cheaper liquid nitrogen cooling (77 K).1424 
The remarkable SMM properties of dysprosocenium cations arise from a combination of their 
highly axial ligand fields and molecular rigidity, which maximize magnetic anisotropy and 
inhibit molecular vibrations that promote magnetic relaxation.13,5,25,26 
The largest Ueff values are obtained for Dy(CpR)2 cations when the CpR ligands are 
close to the Dy(III) ion and the CpRcentroidDyCpRcentroid angle approaches linearity.18,26 
Calculations on relatively small dysprosocenium cations like Dy(Cp)2 (Cp  C5Me5) 
predict very slow Orbach relaxation, due to limited vibrations that are offresonance with 
electronic transitions.26 However, due to predominantly electrostatic Ln bonding regimes,27 the 
reduced ligand steric bulk of Cp allows significant equatorial interactions with weakly 
coordinating anions (WCAs) and donor solvents; these promote magnetic relaxation and reduce 
magnetic hysteresis temperatures (TH) compared to isolated dysprosocenium cations (which 
have reached up to 80 K).18,2834 As the multistep syntheses of air and moisturesensitive target 
molecules can be arduous, we envisaged that in silico screening could provide a more efficient 
approach to identify isolable dysprosocenium cations in advance of laboratory work.
