Description:
A synthetic stereoactive polymer with chiral centers affecting its physicochemical and functional properties.

Text:
Chiral resolution can be achieved, inter alia, 
by chiral chromatography, in which a chiral compound is immobilized on the surface of the stationary 
phase.2 Accordingly, it may appear logical to utilize chiral drug delivery systems to also preferentially 
interactsolubilize a drug enantiomer of interest. Therefore, synthetic stereoactive polymers, in which 
repeating units feature chiral centers have attracted some attention. Recent studies on poly(lactide) 
(PLA),3 poly(glutamic acid)4 and poly(leucine) based block copolymers5 have reported the effect of 
polymer stereoregularity on the physicochemical and functional properties of their selfassembled 
nanostructures.6 Feng et al.
