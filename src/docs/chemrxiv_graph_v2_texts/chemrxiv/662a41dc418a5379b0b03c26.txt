Description:
Used in biomimetic catalysts to generate high-valent metal-oxo species capable of abstracting hydrogen atoms.

Direct hydroxylation of CH bonds presents a promising strategy 
for the late stage diversification of diverse compounds in a step
economical fashion. Despite the challenges associated with the 
ubiquity and inertness of CH bonds, numerous transition metal 
catalysts have been reported to catalyze this transformation1. A 
significant proportion of them are biomimetic, relying on iron or 
manganesebased catalysts to generate a highvalent metaloxo 
species that is capable of abstracting a hydrogen atom1hr. The 
resulting carboncentered radical can engage in the formation of 
CO bonds, either through a rebound mechanism or by utilizing 
an alternative source of oxygen atoms2. Within the green 
chemistry paradigm, regio and stereoselective hydrocarbon 
oxidation should proceed under mild conditions and produce 
minimal waste.
