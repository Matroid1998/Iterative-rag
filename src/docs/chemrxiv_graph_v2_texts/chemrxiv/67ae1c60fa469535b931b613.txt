Description:
Used in activated carbon filters for advanced water cleaning processes.

Text:
In Germany more than 96  of waste water is 
treated by conventional waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), which typically consist of a 
mechanical, a biological and a precipitation stage.20 However, even stateoftheart WWTPs 
having an additional fourth stage comprised of oxidation via ozonation andor activated carbon 
filters cannot remove all trace contaminants sufficiently.21 Consequently, advanced water 
cleaning is an active field of research. One way to classify approaches is by their biological,
