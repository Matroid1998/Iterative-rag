Description:
A product selectively produced by the Co TerpyRF system in a hydrophobic catalytic pocket.

Text:
To our surprise, the Co TerpyRF system was 
found to be selective for methane production, a stark contrast to other Copyridine catalysts that 
primarily produced CO or formate.18,2024 
A gamut of mechanistic investigations provided evidence that the catalysts operated within 
a hydrophobic catalytic pocket through which protons were shuttled via a pyridine ligand centered 
conduit. This unique environment altered the selectivity from CO to CH4, with an optimized system 
featuring Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 80 at 10 mA cm2, a first for molecular CO2R systems.
