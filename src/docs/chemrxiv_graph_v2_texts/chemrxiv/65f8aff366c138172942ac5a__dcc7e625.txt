Description:
Undergoes huge volumetric expansion after lithiation, causing stress and material pulverization.

However,
its practical implementation is limited by a main bottleneck, the huge volumetric expansion
after lithiation (310 for Li22Si5 4) which causes a large buildup of stress, resulting in the
pulverization of the material and immediate capacity loss during cycling.59 An example is
the loss of 70 of the capacity of silicon anode made from 10 m silicon powder within the
first five cycles.10 There has been a surge in research output to tackle this bottleneck over
the past decade.11 Specifically, one focus of research is on using micronano sized particle
silicon anodes as they have been shown to resist cracking and accommodate the volumetric
change.1113 However, the improvement is still not sufficient for practical application.
