Description:
Plays a role in the primary coordination sphere of enzymes, affecting their reactivity.

Text:
2OGdependent nonheme iron enzymes (NHFe) catalyze a diverse range of reactions ranging 
from epoxidation to stereoinversion.1 From natural product biosynthesis to cellular signaling 
and metabolism, the reactions catalyzed by this superfamily of enzymes serve crucial roles 
biologically.2,3 Two subgroups of this superfamily are the hydroxylases and halogenases. Hydroxylases catalyze the insertion of a hydroxyl functional group into unactivated aliphatic C
H bonds while halogenases catalyze the insertion of a chloridebromide functionality into such 
bonds. The difference in reactivity of the two enzymes is enabled by differences in their iron
binding primary coordination sphere.

Description:
Binds via a 2 His1 Carboxyl facial triad in hydroxylases and halogenases.

Text:
Hydroxylases bind iron via a 2 His1 Carboxyl (AspGlu) 
facial triad analogous to halogenases except that in halogenases the carboxyl ligand is replaced 
by a nonpolar Ala or Gly residue.1,4 This amino acid substitution in halogenases enables the 
steric and electrostatic accommodation of an iron coordinated halide anion that is essential for 
halogenation reactivity.5 Both hydroxylases and halogenases have been suggested to operate via 
a similar catalytic mechanism (Fig S1).6,7 Once 2OG, iron, and substrate are bound to the 
enzyme, a conformational change is triggered that facilitates molecular oxygen binding to the 
iron center. Next, oxidative decarboxylation of the 2OG cosubstrate results in the cleavage of 
oxygens OO bond and the formation of a highvalent ferryl intermediate (FeIVO).
