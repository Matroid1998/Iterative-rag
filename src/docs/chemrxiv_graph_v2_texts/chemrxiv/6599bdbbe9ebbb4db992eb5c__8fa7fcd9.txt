Description:
A fragment (CONHNCH) present in nacylhydrazones.

Text:
Nacylhydrazones (NAH) are distinguished by the presence of an azomethine 
fragment (CONHNCH), which, when integrated or connected into a heterocyclic scaffold, 
frequently yields compounds exhibiting noteworthy biological activities,13 including 
anticancer,4,5 antibacterial,6 and antidepressant properties.7 Acrylohydrazides, a distinct class 
within these organic compounds, have recently garnered attention due to their multifunctional 
properties.8 Among them, (E)3(furan2yl) acrylohydrazides stand out, featuring the 
conjugated furan2yl scaffold linked to a hydrazide function.
