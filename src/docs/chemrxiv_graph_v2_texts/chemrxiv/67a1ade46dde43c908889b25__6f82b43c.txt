Description:
Used for well-resolved correlations in studying arginine side chain dynamics.

Text:
We implemented a synthetic route to access 13C2H15N 
arginine 12 (Figure 1). To investigate the incorporation efficiency, 
we used this isotopelabelled Arg in the E. coli based 
overexpression of the model protein ubiquitin. Moreover, we 
showed the utility of our approach by studying the interaction of 
ubiquitin and the third Src homology 3 domain (SH3) of the 
cytoskeletal protein binding domain Sla1.33 Our method is a 
general approach to explore, for example, dynamics and 
interaction of arginine side chains, taking advantage of well
resolved 1H13C or 13C15N correlations in future studies.
