Description:
A precursor material used in the production of carbon fibers.

To address this issue, researchers have started to work on various other 
precursors, such as polyethylene, lignin, and rayon. Table 1 compares the cost per kg of lignin 
with the total cost of PAN and pitch. The table shows that lignin is a more costeffective 
precursor than current carbon fiber precursors. Additionally, it is the only largevolume aromatic renewable feedstock with 60 to 65 carbon 
content, making it a potential precursor for carbon fibers 45. Lignin is mainly produced by 
paper and pulp industries, with a current annual production of 50 to 70 million metric tonnes 
worldwide, of which less than 2 are utilized to produce valueadded products such as 
formulations of dispersants, binders, and surfactants, and the remainder serve as combustor 
for heating and power generation 6.
