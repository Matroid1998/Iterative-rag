Description:
A hygroscopic polymer commonly used as an ASD excipient.

However, despite the proven advantages of ASDs, several shortcomings hinder the successful 
translation of more ASDbased dosage forms to the market.3,4 The drug load in stable ASDs is 
typically low (10  30 wt) as it is limited by the drug solubility in the polymer at storage 
temperature,2,5 this in turn means that the size of the dosage form increases when a higher drug 
dose is required, with negative implications for the patient. Furthermore, many polymers 
commonly used as ASD excipients, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are hygroscopic. Such 
excipients increase the molecular mobility in the ASDs due to the plasticizing effect of adsorbed
