Description:
Requires an aqueous electrolyte for reduction processes.

1718 The composition of the electrolyte may also 
play an important role here. Ultrafast spectroscopy is highly useful to investigate the lightinduced processes in photoactive 
materials. Notably, most ultrafast spectroscopy studies on dyesensitized photocathodes have 
been carried out in air or in an organic solvent instead of under operating conditions.8, 1923 Though, 
some femtosecond transient absorption studies on dyesensitized NiO photocathodes showed 
that a negative potential could increase the hole injection efficiency and slow down charge 
recombination.2427 However, these studies were carried out in an acetonitrilebased electrolyte, 
while for proton or CO2 reduction an aqueous electrolyte is needed. 2829 Moreover, we recently 
observed that the working environment of a NiObased photocathode plays an important role 
in both the lightinduced hole injection and charge recombination dynamics.
