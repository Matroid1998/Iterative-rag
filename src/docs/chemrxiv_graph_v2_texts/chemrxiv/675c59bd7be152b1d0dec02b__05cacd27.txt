Description:
Coin cells used for measuring Coulombic efficiency of Li metal in electrolytes.

With such improvements, it is nowadays increasingly common to encounter 
reports of CE exceeding 99.9,12,1517 
As CE of Li metal in liquid electrolytes has rapidly increased, accurately measuring, 
reporting, and benchmarking this key performance indicator has become of heightened importance. The standard measurement for CE uses LiCu coin cells (Figure 1a). Owing to the accessibility of 
components and ease of assembly, coin cells enable lean quantities of active materials and 
electrolytes to be rapidly tested at reasonable cost and low burden of labor, in contrast to more 
commercially relevant pouch cells. Their offtheshelf components also enable a nominal degree 
of standardization in CE measurement. Consequently, virtually all reported CE data for Li metal 
batteries originate from coin cells.
