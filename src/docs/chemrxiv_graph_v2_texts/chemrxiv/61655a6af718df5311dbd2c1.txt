Description:
Used in automated synthesis for creating sequence-defined polymers of nucleic acids.

Text:
The phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acids provides an 
attractive platform for the creation of sequencedefined 
molecules because of the outstanding efficiency of the 
automated phosphoramidite synthesis which permits creation of 
polymers of 100 monomer units long.19,20 DA interactions have 
been integrated into DNA itself,21 and the phosphodiester 
backbone has been used in development of various stacked 
folded and selfassembled systems, generating significant 
complexity from oligomers as short as trimers.2224 Since 
aromatic donor and acceptor units are complementary in a 
supramolecular sense, they reflect the hydrogenbonded 
complementarity of nucleobases, and their sequence in a chain 
could therefore be used to control selfassembly. We now report 
that the selfassembly of phosphodiesterlinked trimers of DAN 
and NDI is sequencedetermined, and moreover can be modified 
through complementarity of monomer sequences.
