Description:
A biomaterial glass studied for its crystallization effects on mechanical properties such as bending strength and fracture toughness.

studied the eects of crystallization
volume fraction and crystallite size on mechanical properties, such as bending strength and
fracture toughness, in a biomaterial composed of P2O5Na2OCaOSiO2 glass.6 Lu et al. improved ionic conductivity by synthesizing glassceramics via partial crystallization of sul
de glasses used as solid electrolyte materials.21 By optimizing crystallization time and heat
treatment temperature, they controlled the crystallinity, achieving an optimized material
with an ionic conductivity (1.33  103 Scm) 1.8 times greater than that (7.4  104 Scm)
of glass with the same composition.22
These studies demonstrate that the properties of glassceramic materials are signicantly
inuenced by the amount and morphology of crystals within the glassy phases. The crys
talline particles precipitated in the bulk glass inherently form interfaces with the glass phase.
