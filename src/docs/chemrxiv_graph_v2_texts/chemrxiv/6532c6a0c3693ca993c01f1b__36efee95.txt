Description:
Forms a passivation layer that protects implants from corrosion and allows for direct fusion with bone.

Text:
The titanium oxide passivation layer protects the implant from 
corrosion and allows for direct fusion with bone to provide mechanical stability.1 The process of osseointegration, or 
the direct structural and functional connection between implant and bone, is paramount for the longterm stability of 
a loadbearing implant.1 Failure of orthopedic and dental implant can occur shortly after implantation (weeks post
surgery) or even years after implantation.2 Among the causes of device failure, implantassociated infections (IAI) 
remain the top cause for revision surgeries in orthopedic and dental implants in North America, primarily because 
bacterial infections cause bone resorption and device loosening.25 Eradication of IAI is particularly challenging 
because surfacedwelling bacteria are protected by a selfsecreted biofilm, making them 1000x less susceptible to 
antibiotics than planktonic bacteria and also reduces the effectivity of the hosts immune cells.6 A bacterial biofilm 
can be defined as a surfaceassociated bacterial community embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM).7 The ECM 
is composed of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and glycoproteins, which create a polymeric habitat for the 
bacteria.
