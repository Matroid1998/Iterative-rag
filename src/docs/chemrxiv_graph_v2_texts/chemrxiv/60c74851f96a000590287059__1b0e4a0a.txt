Description:
Involved in magnesium-halogen exchange to prepare arylmagnesium halide monomers.

Stille and Suzuki coupling are commonly employed in
these syntheses, although others are reported. (Bao et al. (1999); Argun et al. (2004),Yiu et al. (2012))
The single greatest renement in the crosscoupling synthesis of polyarene CPs came in the mid2000s
from the Yokozawa and McCullough groups, (Yokoyama and Yokozawa (2007); Sheina et al. (2004))
in which AB monomers were prepared by monometallation of an aryl dihalide. The most common
metallation approach uses magnesiumhalogen exchange of an alkylmagnesium halide to prepare an
arylmagnesium halide monomer. This modication yielded a dramatic improvement in polydispersity of
the prepared polymers, especially polythiophenes and poly(pphenylenes), relative to an AABB approach. The improvement is attributed to a change in mechanism, from a typical crosscoupling catalytic cycle
to the socalled catalysttransfer (CT) mechanism.
