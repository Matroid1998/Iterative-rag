Description:
Used in the halogenation of olefins.

Text:
In the industrial preparation of these building 
blocks, main routes involve the halogenation of either the corresponding olefin with hydrohalic 
acids or the conversion of the corresponding alcohol (Scheme 1B).14,15 To illustrate, 
considering the introduction of an ethyl unit via conventional crosscoupling, the apparent C2 
synthon is bromoethane or species derived from it (e.g., organoboron, organozinc reagents).11
13 Intriguingly, bromoethane derives from the hydrobromination of ethylene, which in turn 
originates from the energyintensive steam cracking of naturally occurring ethane (Scheme 
1C).1517 Consequently, these drawbacks have spurred growing interest within the scientific
