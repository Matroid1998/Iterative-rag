Description:
Has a core structure with stereodefined heteroatoms and three contiguous stereocenters.

Text:
Interestingly, genetically engineered analogs 45 
showed reduced mammalian cell cytotoxicity,7c although their 
structures differ slightly from 13. As genetic engineering 
cannot provide tailored analogs, a modular synthetic approach 
to these scaffolds would be valuable. Challenging structural 
features include stereodefined heteroatoms at each carbon of 
the cyclopentane core, three contiguous stereocenters at C1
C3 each possessing a different amine functionality and three 
fully substituted carbons at C1, C4 and C5. The synrelationship 
between the C1 urea and the C2 amine and the trans
relationship between the C4C5 tertiary alcohols can also 
cause undesired crossreactivity.
