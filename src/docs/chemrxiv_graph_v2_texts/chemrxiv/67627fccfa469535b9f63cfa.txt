Functionalities that enable the introduction of two lipid chains.

of two lipid chains while minimizing the linker structure to a 1,2,3
triazol, compared to the bulky hydrophobic SPAAC linker variants. To obtain the ADC lipid, we 
performed a transesterification from commercially available dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate and 
stearyl alcohol in high isolated yields (Figure 1A). The two ester functionalities enable the introduction 
of two lipid chains which remains standard for PLs used for LNP preparation. In addition, this 
procedure allows adjusting the lipidchain length, simply by using the desired fatty alcohol. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024dvp75 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000155677404 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
