Description:
Used in the hydrothermal leaching of monazite iron oxide ores.

Text:
Previously, the authors of this article studied in detail the hydrothermal nitric 
acid leaching of monazite iron oxide ores from the Chuktukon deposit (Russia) 
(Kuzmin et al., 2012; Serdyuk et al., 2017). It has been established that at 
temperatures above 180 C, a significant decrease in the concentrations of 
phosphorus and iron in solutions is observed. Simultaneously with an increase in 
temperature, the extraction of lanthanides into the solution increases, which 
reaches 9798. This creates great prospects for the practical use of the process 
(Kuzmin et al., 2015), both for processing rare earth ores of this type and monazite 
concentrates.
