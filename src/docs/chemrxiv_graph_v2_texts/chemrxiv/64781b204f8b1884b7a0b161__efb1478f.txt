This unique combination of attributes 
sets SACs apart from traditional catalysts and highlights their potential for advancing catalytic 
processes.2 Formation of effective SA catalytic sites holds also great promise in the field of 
heterogeneous photocatalysis where the deposition of additional catalysts (so called co
catalysts) onto the surface of lightabsorbing photocatalysts is often mandatory in order to 
improve the extraction of photogenerated charges (i.e., electrons and holes), enhance the rate 
of their reaction with reactants, and thus to increase the quantum yield of the photocatalytic 
processes which is typically only few percent in the absence of cocatalysts.3 A particular 
advantage of SACs in photocatalysis is their very low effective crosssection for light absorption 
as compared to metal or metal oxide catalysts with a fully developed longrange electronic 
structure, which makes it easier to avoid the parasitic light absorption by the cocatalyst that 
would otherwise block the excitation of the light absorber and hamper the overall photocatalytic 
activity.4 Recently, several examples of various photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2, CdS, BiVO4, 
polymeric carbon nitride, carbon quantum dots) modified with SACs comprising different metal 
(e.g., Pt, Ir, Rh, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sn, In) atoms or ions have been demonstrated for various 
applications, including degradation of harmful organic compounds,5 hydrogen evolution,6 
water oxidation to dioxygen,7 or useful selective lightdriven conversions,8 such as dioxygen 
reduction to H2O2,9 selective oxidations of alcohols,10 benzene,11 benzylamine,12 and 
NOx,13 or CC coupling reactions.14 However, our knowledge on the mechanism of 
photocatalysis enhancement at SACmodified photocatalysts is still rather limited, 6d, 15 which 
makes the rational design of highperformance photocatalysts based on SACs very 
challenging.
