Description:
Used as a catalyst in methanoltohydrocarbon conversions.

observed a higher propenepropane ratio when employing ITQ13 instead of the 
widely used zeolite ZSM5 as catalyst additive.3 They attributed this difference to a higher shape 
selectivity towards propene caused by the narrower pore dimensions, a finding that was confirmed in 
subsequent work.5 ITQ13 was also found to give a product spectrum different from other zeolite 
catalysts (ZSM5, MCM22) in methanoltohydrocarbon (MTH) conversions, potentially enhancing the 
flexibility of the MTH process in the context of varying demands for different products.6 
ITQ13 is the type material of the ITH framework,7 which can be decomposed into four types of 
discrete cages doublefour ring (d4r) cages (face symbol 46, labelled tcub in the nomenclature of 
natural tilings8), lau cages (face symbol 4264, tlau), stf cages (face symbol 456, tnuh) and 45262 
cages (tmel).
