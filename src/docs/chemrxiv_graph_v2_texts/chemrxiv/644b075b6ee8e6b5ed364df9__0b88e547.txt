Description:
Has high initial reactivity that is roughly temperature independent below 1600 K.

Text:
Graphite, graphene, graphene oxide, carbon 
black, and diamond NPs all were found to have initial reactivities in the same order of 
magnitude, with significant NPtoNP variation attributed to differences in the NP structures and 
surface site distributions. The initial reactivity for graphitic and carbon black NPs was high and 
roughly TNP independent below 1600 K, then fell gradually at higher TNP. One surprise was that under O2 etching conditions, with TNP  1600 K, all graphitic and carbon 
black NPs eventually passivated, i.e., became inert toward further O2 attack, implying that the 
NP surfaces had transformed to be nearly free of reactive, undercoordinated sites.
