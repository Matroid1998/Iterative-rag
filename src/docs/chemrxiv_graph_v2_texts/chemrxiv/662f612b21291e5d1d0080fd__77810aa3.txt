Description:
Porous materials that provide a confinement effect leading to transition state stabilization in reactions.

Text:
The methanol to DME reaction is promoted by the unique
porous structure of zeolites, this provides a confinement effect
that leads to transition state stabilisation.26 This work focuses
on the MFI framework type structure (commonly known as ZSM
5), shown in fig. 1. This framework has orthorhombic symmetry
(Pnma) within a large range of operating temperatures, and is
composed of straight parallel pores (fig. 1a) intersected by sinu
soidal pores (fig. 1b). These ordered pores provide large inter
