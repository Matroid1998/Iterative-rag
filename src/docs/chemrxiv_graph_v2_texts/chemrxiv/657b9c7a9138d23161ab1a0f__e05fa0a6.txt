In the drive to remove Co from these cathodes, it is critical to understand the behaviour of 
the ultimate Nirich archetype, LiNiO2.15 At high states of charge, LiNiO2 exhibits Oloss, a contraction 
in interlayer spacing, particle cracking and poor cycling stability.512 Substantial efforts have been 
made to understand these phenomena and the structural transitions that take place when Li is 
extracted from LiNiO2, but there remains considerable debate over the extent of Ni oxidation and O
redox in LiNiO2, particularly across the voltage plateau at 4.2 V.1316 Despite reaching a composition 
close to NiO2 at the end of charge with Ni nominally in the 4 oxidation state, bulk sensitive Xray 
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) appears to show incomplete oxidation of Ni3 to Ni4 when the edge 
position is compared to other Ni4containing oxides.14,15 Some argue that this reflects the change in 
covalency of the NiO bond with the electronhole density shifting more towards O than Ni when Ni is 
highly oxidised,8,1719 while others argue O oxidation is invoked.1315,20 
Recent research into O oxidation in Lirich cathodes, such as Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, has indicated that 
oxidised oxygen takes the form of molecular O2, which is trapped within vacancy clusters in the 
cathode structure.2125 However, in the case of stoichiometric materials like LiNiO2, it has been argued 
that this same mechanism cannot apply due to the lack of transition metal vacancies in the fully dense
