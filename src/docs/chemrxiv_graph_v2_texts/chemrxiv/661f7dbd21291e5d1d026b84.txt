Description:
Inorganic molecules believed to be key in cluster formation.

Text:
Molecular clusters, formed through the aggregation of various atmospheric species, play
a central role in aerosol particle formation, cloud nucleation, and chemical reactions, thus
influencing climate, air quality, and environmental chemistry.1 The key species in cluster for
mation are believed to be inorganic molecules such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, and amines,
enhanced by other species such as water, methanesulfonic acid, nitric acid, formic acid, and
highly oxygenated organic molecules.24 Theoretical studies typically aim to elucidate the
thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular interactions governing cluster formation and its
evolution.
