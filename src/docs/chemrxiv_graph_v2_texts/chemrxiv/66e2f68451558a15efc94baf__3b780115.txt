Description:
A value-added chemical that can be synthesized from syngas.

Text:
The reverse watergas shift (RWGS)14 and its corresponding reverse reaction (WGS) are key technologies 
because of their central role in syngas conversion in the chemical industry. Furthermore, RWGS and WGS 
processes are foreseen to play a major role in all processes related to CO2 conversion and H2 production, 
which are central to possible strategies for the mitigation of CO2 emissions. Indeed, the RWGS reaction 
enables the conversion of CO2 into syngas (CO  H2), which can be further converted into valueadded 
chemicals via FischerTropsch synthesis and other syngas processes, e.g. methanol synthesis.58 RWGS 
is endothermic (H0  42.1 kJmol) and thermodynamically favored at high operating temperatures 
(500700 C). However, these harsh conditions result in catalyst deactivation and high energetic cost.
