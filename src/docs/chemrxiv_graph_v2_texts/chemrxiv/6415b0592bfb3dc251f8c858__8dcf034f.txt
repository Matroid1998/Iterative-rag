Description:
Rich in terms of structural chemistry with reported CuAu, TiAl3, and ZrAl3 type structures.

Text:
Pdrich MmPdn (M  Ga, In) ordered intermetallic compounds follow the siteisolation 
concept; these compounds can be prepared with a high degree of reproducibility, and the 
crystal structure and atomic ordering can be controlled on the basis of reaction 
conditions. Most of these compounds possess strong covalenttype PdM interactions, 
that modify the electronic structure, surface adsorption properties and also provide long
term stability 19. In the binary phase field of the InPd system, InPd3 is rich in terms of structural chemistry. It was first reported to have a CuAu type structure by Schubert et. al. 10, 11. Later, two 
other structural modifications (TiAl3type and ZrAl3type) were reported by Bhan and 
Schubert 12.

Description:
Compound with atomic distributions confirmed using neutron powder diffraction.

Text:
Kohlmann and Ritter had performed systematic experimental 
investigations using neutron powder diffraction and confirmed the atomic distributions 
of In and Pd (belonging to close Xray scattering factors) in the three different structure 
types of InPd3 13. According to their report, the reaction conditions play an important 
role in determining the structure type. Long annealing time at high temperature (T  800 
K) leads to the ZrAl3 structure type (I4mmm (no. 139); a  406.196(5) pm, c  
1520.31(2) pm, Z 4). Shorter reaction time at relatively low temperature (T  750 K) 
leads to the TiAl3 structure type (I4mmm (no. 139), a  409.96(2) pm, c  747.59(5)
