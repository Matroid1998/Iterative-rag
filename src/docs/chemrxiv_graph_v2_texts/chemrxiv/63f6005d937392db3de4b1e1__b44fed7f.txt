Description:
Catalyst used in CH functionalizations with chiral NHC ligands.

Subsequent insertion of the olefin 
would lead to the same alkyl nickel intermediate. The energy barrier of a straight C(sp3)C(sp3) 
reductive elimination leading to direct 1,2hydroalkylation product is higher than a 
corresponding C(sp2)C(sp3) reductive elimination31. We thus hypothesized that the enhanced 
lifetime of the alkyl nickel intermediate would allow to trigger complexitygenerating 
downstream reactions. For instance, alkyl Ni(II) species can engage in chainwalking processes 
32,33,34,35,36,37. In the present context such increased molecular complexity comes together with 
challenges of controlling regio, diastereo, and ultimately enantioselectivity. Capitalizing on 
our longstanding experience in the design and application of chiral NHC ligands for Ni(0)
catalyzed CH functionalizations,38,39,40,41,42 we initiated the development of a competent 
catalyst system to address these challenges and channel.
