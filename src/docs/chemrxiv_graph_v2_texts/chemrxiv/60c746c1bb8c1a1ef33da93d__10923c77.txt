Description:
Segregates to the surface of ligaments in nanoporous gold.

Text:
The oxygendriven surface evolution and the 
enhancing role for a Ag segregation to the surface of ligaments in nanoporous gold have been 
revealed in our previous study based on Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations (AIMD).13 
To reduce thermal and possible reactioninduced coarsening of npAu, deposition of nano
sized oxide particles (TiO2 or CeO2) has been proven to be an opportunity to drastically improve 
the thermal stability of the material and at the same time to increase its catalytic activity.25, 3437
