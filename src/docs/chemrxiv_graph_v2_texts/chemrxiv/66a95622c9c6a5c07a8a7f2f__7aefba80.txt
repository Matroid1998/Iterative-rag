Description:
Activated forms used as advanced sorbents for dioxin capture and removal.

Text:
Numerous studies have focused on addressing this
problem by exploring diverse chemical and physical processes for dioxin degradation. These ap
proaches encompass photocatalysis 5, 6, 7, hydrothermal degradation 8, burning 9, catalytic
degradation 10, radiolysis 11, 12, electrochemical oxidation 13, 14, and biodegradation 15. Figure 1 Schematic chemical structure of 2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin (TCDD). Recent studies have investigated various advanced sorbents, such as zeolites, metalorganic
frameworks (MOFs), and activated carbons, for the capture and removal of dioxins, particularly
TCDD. Zeolites, especially those doped with metals like silver, copper, and iron, have demonstrated
adsorption capabilities due to their high surface area and the ability to form strong interactions
