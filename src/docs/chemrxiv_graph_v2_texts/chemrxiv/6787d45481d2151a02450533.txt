Description:
Synthetic structures expanded by organic structure directing agents.

Text:
of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) by Richard Barrer was a pivotal development that propelled 
the expansion of synthetic zeolite structures.1 In zeolite science, alkylammonium cations are perhaps the most widely used 
OSDAs, although phosphonium cations2 and cationic metal complexes with alkylamine ligands have also been used in the 
development of novel phases. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are another class of porous materials and as the name suggests they are made of two 
main components that typically selfassemble in the absence of SDAs. In most cases the positive charge of the metal cation 
will be balanced by the negative charges of coordinating ligands such as the linker, bridging oxideshydroxides, or terminal 
ligands such as OH or F. Therefore, the majority of MOFs are charge neutral.
