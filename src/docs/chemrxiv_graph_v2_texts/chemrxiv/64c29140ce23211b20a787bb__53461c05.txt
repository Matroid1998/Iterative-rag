Description:
Exhibits weak n-type semiconducting behavior when undoped and degenerate conductivity when doped with La or F.

Its defect chemistry has been studied previ
ously with hybrid density functional theory (DFT), indicating weak ntype semiconducting
behaviour when undoped, and degenerate conductivity when doped with La or F.1316
However, computational investigation into its ptype defect chemistry have thus far been
overlooked. The combination of optical transparency and bipolar conductivity in a single material,
implying the possibility of a transparent pn homojunction, is a lucrative prospect, as it
would simplify deposition and minimise strain at the interface between the p and ntype
layers within a device (compared to a pn heterojunction such as SnOSnO2).17 Achieving
bipolarity in BaSnO3 is particularly appealing due to its perovskite structure, which could
enable a transparent pn homojunction as part of a larger perovskite oxide device with
relative ease.
