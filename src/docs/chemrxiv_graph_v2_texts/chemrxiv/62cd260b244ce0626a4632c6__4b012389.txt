Emerging water contaminants such as pharmaceuticals have recently gained 
considerable research attention (Balarak et al., 2021). Among pharmaceuticals, antibiotics are 
the most widely consumed pharmaceutical drugs (Azizi, 2020) that pollute water bodies. There are different classes of antibiotics based on their mechanism of action, chemical 
structure, action spectrum, and route of administration (Ilurdoz et al., 2022). The most 
common classification of antibiotics is based on their mode of action, which includes 
fluoroquinolones, quinolones, lactams, sulfonamides, monobactams, carbapenems, and 
aminoglycosides. Quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin) are 
broadspectrum antibiotics that are widely prescribed (Ilurdoz et al., 2022). More 
importantly, CIP stands in the first place based on the number of antibiotics prescribed in this 
group (Movasaghi et al., 2019).
