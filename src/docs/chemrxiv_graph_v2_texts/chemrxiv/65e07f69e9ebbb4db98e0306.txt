Description:
An anticancer drug that can be effectively loaded and delivered using anionic microgels.

Chargeinduced drug bind
ing of drugs to functionalized microgels is a common mech
anism for controlled uptake and release in microgel drug
delivery.5,6,10,16,17 To guarantee an efficient loading, the func
tional microgel should not only possess charged groups but
also it should exhibit a net charge that fosters the loading when
in contact with the drug buffer.10 Anionic microgels have
proven their potential utilization in the uptake and delivery
of, e.g., doxorubicin,18,19 ferritin17 among other proteins,20
while cationic microgels for DNA, RNA and oligonucleotides,
which results advantageous for gene delivery systems.10
A deep understanding of the fundamental mechanisms un
derlying the swelling of ionic microgels and their interaction
with other charged species is crucial for further advance in the
field.
