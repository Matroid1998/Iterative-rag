The International Energy Agency predicts that for a global net zero emission scenario by 2050, 
60 Mt of hydrogen will be used for power generation.1 Hydrogenfed fuel cells, specifically low
temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), are a promising zero CO2 
emission technology with hightechnology readiness to fulfill sectors of power generation.2 This 
is due to PEMFCs load flexibility and therefore wide range of applications within stationary and 
portable power generation, and particularly transportation.2 PEMFCs rising prominence in 
transportation applications is supported by global Government targets of 2.5 million fuel cell 
electric vehicles (FCEV) on the road by 2030.3 
Ptbased nanoparticles on carbon (PtC) catalysts are commonly implemented in commercial 
PEMFCs to facilitate the electrochemical reactions.4 The reaction kinetics at the cathode, where 
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs, are far more sluggish than at the anode and, as a 
result, the cathode has previously required 8090 of the total Pt within the PEMFC.5 Hence, Pt
based cathode catalysts have been projected as the largest single component cost of an 80 kW 
PEMFC stack at production rates of 500,000 stacks year1.6 The price volatility of Pt and 
subsequent catalyst cost sensitivity would also heavily impact fuel cell costs, making widerscale 
commercialization difficult.7 In terms of Pt supply, South Africa provided 6574 and Russia 
1014 of the worlds Pt between 2017 and 2021.8 Moreover, industrial recycling of Pt has 
remained low to date (total 30, combustion automotive 55).8,9 This dependency on fresh 
Pt supplies is unfavorable since highly reliant on global supply chains and trade agreements.
