Description:
An electrode system where active material particle sizes influence effective conductivities.

Text:
Similarly strong correlations between 
effective ionic and electronic conductivity and the volumetric ratios of the composite 
components were found in cathode systems such as NCM622LPSCl12, LiMn2O4Li3InCl613 and 
SLPSClC14. On the other hand, the microstructure of the composite electrode can influence 
its effective conductivities. Froboese et al.15 demonstrated the influence of differently sized 
inclusions on the effective ionic conductivity of composites. Studies investigating the effect of 
changing active material particle sizes in NCM622LPSCl16 and SiLPSClC17 electrodes on
