Description:
The solvent of choice for the described method.

Text:
I) metal catalysts face the issue of metallic 
deuterium atom transfers (mDAT);34 II) an organomediator to 
avoid any metallic residues in reference to the development of 
novel mediated styrene reductions; III) providing a general, 
economical and environmentalfriendly approach in reference to 
their developed method. A solvent screen revealed DMF to be the 
solvent of choice (a few examples of our method were run in DMF), 
however no MeCN was tested which works best for the reductions 
developed by Cheng and Li28 and Werz.33 The authors claim of 
a careful optimization is hence not fitting. It is worth mentioning 
that the scope of both reactions presented in Scheme 2b share 
one example (d)28a in equal yields of 81. The scope presented 
by Qiu et al.
