Description:
A biodegradable plastic polymer that can be degraded by LPMO activity.

Text:
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs)1,2 are unique
monocopper enzymes that exhibit a broad range of functions3
They boost the degradation of recalcitrant and insoluble polysac
charides, making them essential components of industrial enzyme
cocktails used in sustainable biofuel production.4 Additionally,
LPMOs have been shown to contribute to plant pathogen viru
lence5 and potentially also to human diseases.6 Furthermore, a
recent study reported LPMO activity on poly(3hydroxybutyrate)
 a biodegradable plastic polymer  enabling the leverage of the
LPMO reactivity in degradation of microplastic pollutants.7
LPMOs
are
grouped
into
eight
different
families
of
carbohydrateactive enzymes with auxiliary activities (AA9
AA11
and
AA13AA17).1,2,5,812
The
eight
families
differ
substantially in their substrate specificy, activesite architecture
and also their reactivity.
