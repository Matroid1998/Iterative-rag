Description:
Involved in CH bonds where its s-character affects donor ability.

Text:
The theoretical study 
of these descriptors has proven to be very useful in establishing the electronic 
properties of carbenes or confirming the relevance of these descriptors,15 as 
illustrated by the work of Gusev16 and of Nolan and Cavallo.17 
Recently, the magnitude of the 1JCH coupling constants in azoliumtype NHC precursors 
(as well as the 1JCSe coupling constants in NHCSe complexes) has been proposed by 
Ganter as a promising measure of the donation of NHCs.18 This descriptor is 
assumed to be strongly related to the scharacter of the carbon involved in the CH 
bond,1922 with larger 1JCH value indicating weaker donor ability.

Description:
A divalent ligand whose donation can be estimated using NMR spectra.

Text:
It is particularly 
attractive for estimating the donation of divalent carbon ligand, as it only requires 
the 13C or 1H NMR spectrum of the readily available NHC precursor azolium salt.23 On 
the other hand, the 1JCSe coupling constant has been shown to provide valuable 
information on NHC ligands; however, its measurement is hindered by the low natural
