Description:
Compounds synthesized via a diastereoselective preparation of enol tosylate followed by a stereoretentive Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling.

Text:
In 2017, our group reported a twostep synthesis of 
tetrasubstituted alkenes, in which the stereochemical outcome 
is set by diastereoselective preparation of the enol tosylate start
ing material, followed by a stereoretentive Pdcatalyzed Su
zukiMiyaura crosscoupling (Figure 1B).43 Although this pro
tocol allowed for the highly selective synthesis of (E)alkenes, 
the selectivity was largely governed by the tosylation step and 
ultimately limited access to (Z)alkenes, whose precursor tosyl
ates were less accessible in high diastereomeric purity.
