Marine invertebratederived natural products (NPs) play a crucial role in their survival 
40 
by providing chemical defense against the hostile marine environment. These 
41 
compounds also exhibit a wide range of biological activities, including antimalarial, 
42 
antitumor, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Significantly, a number of 
43 
bioactive compounds from marine invertebrates have been successfully developed into 
44 
clinical drugs, such as ziconotide, eribulin, and plitidepsin13. 45 
Among the diverse array of NPs, terpenoids are particularly prevalent in marine 
46 
invertebrates4. Notably, cembrane, eunicellane, and biflorane (serrulatane) diterpenoids 
47 
emerge as primary types commonly extracted from corals (Fig. 1)57. Cembrane 
48 
diterpenoids, with their distinctive 14membered ring structure, represent the largest 
49 
group of coralderived diterpenoids, boasting over 1200 individual compounds8, 
50 
including the neuromuscular toxin lophotoxin9.
