Description:
The simplest members of a family of topological molecular nanocarbons.

Text:
Macrocyclic molecular nanocarbons have attracted a 
broad attention among chemists with the promise to revo
lutionize the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. The rapid de
velopment of the synthetic methodologies now allows ac
cess to macrocyclic nanocarbons with various shapes and 
topologies and to exploring their properties.1 The wide in
terest commenced with the first pioneering examples of 
successful synthesis of ncycloparaphenylenes (nCPPs), 
the shortest segments of armchair carbon nanotubes, by Ja
sti,2 Itami,3 and Yamago.4 CPPs are the simplest members of 
a family of topological molecular nanocarbons.1 More com
plex topologies, such as carbon nanobelts,57 carbon 
nanocages,811 figureeight molecules,1214 allcarbon cate
nanes,15 rotaxanes,16,17 and trefoil knots15 have been all suc
cessfully accomplished in the recent years.
