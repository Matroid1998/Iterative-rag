Description:
Facilely oxidizes to Sn(IV), posing challenges in tin-based materials.

Text:
Perhaps the most transformative appli
cations of these materials have been in photovoltaics and radiation detectors.11,12 However,
most leading examples employ Pb2based materials, even though the same Sn2based
materials exist, pose less (but not no) concerns regarding toxicity, and are predicted to
provide comparable optoelectronic properties (e.g., band gaps, mobilities).1316 However,
a key challenge facing these tinbased materials has been their high carrier concentrations,
nominally attributed to the facile oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV).17,18 DFTbased calculations
of point defects in these materials generally agree that tin vacancies tend to be the largest
compensating defect responsible for the large hole concentrations in these materials.1922
