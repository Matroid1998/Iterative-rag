Description:
Organic multiresonant TADF materials used as emitters for OLEDs with high internal quantum efficiency and narrowband emission.

Many chiral helicenes show interesting chiroptical properties and these materials have been 
widely investigated in such diverse fields as bioimaging, optical data storage, optical 
spintronics applications, and circularly polarized organic lightemitting diodes (CPOLEDs).1
8 Most emissive chiral helicenes are fluorescent, but for efficient OLEDs, triplet excitons need 
to be harvested, so helicenes that emit either phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed 
fluorescence (TADF) would be potentially attractive emitters. Organic multiresonant TADF 
(MRTADF) materials have attracted particular attention as emitters for OLEDs as not only 
can devices attain 100 internal quantum efficiency (IQE) but they also show narrowband 
emission and high photoluminescence quantum yield (FPL).912 Thus, the development of 
chiral MRTADF emitters would be particularly attractive for CPMRTADF OLEDs.
