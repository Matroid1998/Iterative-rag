Description:
The longest ncarbohelicene ever synthesized.

Text:
In 2015, 16carbohelicene (A) was synthesized by Mu
rase and Fujita, and this is the longest ncarbohelicene ever 
synthesized (Figure 1).5) The synthesis of longer helicenes 
has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and vari
ous improved synthetic methods have been devised.1cg) 
Helicenes comprising more than triplelayered structures 
are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility 
issues, and because the middlelayered core is tightly 
compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Re
cently, several longer helicene analogues that can release 
the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed.
