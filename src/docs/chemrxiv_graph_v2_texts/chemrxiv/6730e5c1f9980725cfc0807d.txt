Description:
Sequestration of atmospheric carbon in soils.

Text:
The LCFS is credited with reducing the CI of Californias transportation fuel 
55 
pool by approximately 15,2 and U.S. bioethanol production has increased roughly 8fold over 
56 
the past two decades to meet RFS requirements.3 However, cellulosic biofuel production targets 
57 
set by the RFS have never been met, thus preventing the realization of the additional benefits of 
58 
these fuels compared to conventional fuels (e.g., improved biodiversity in agricultural 
59 
landscapes,4 sequestration of atmospheric carbon in soils,5 reduced human health externalities6).
