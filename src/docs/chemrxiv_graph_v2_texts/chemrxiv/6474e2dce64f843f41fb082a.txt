Description:
Environmental pollutants formed from incomplete combustion processes and oil spills, known for absorbing UVA and UVB radiation leading to toxic and mutagenic products.

Polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) are a known 
class of environmental pollutants formed from incomplete com
bustion processes and oil spillssands14. Most PASHs absorb 
UVA and UVB solar radiation that reaches the Earths surface, 
which leads to photophysical and photochemical processes that 
can result in the formation of toxic and mutagenic products, 
hence, causing concern for environmental safety4,5. PASHs are 
also commonly used as synthetic building blocks that can be 
tuned for applications such as organic lightemitting diodes 
(OLED), organic fieldeffect transistors, and solar cells711. However, their excited state dynamics and electronic relaxation 
mechanisms are not completely understood.
