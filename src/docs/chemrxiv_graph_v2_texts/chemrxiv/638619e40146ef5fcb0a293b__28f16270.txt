Description:
A metal used in lithium-ion batteries, known for its poor abundance and uneven distribution.

Text:
Even though lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have achieved unprecedented commercial success 
in the previous decades, uneven distribution and poor abundance of lithium lead to raw material 
supply tensions that pose a severe challenge for their use in largescale applications.1,2 In this regard, 
sodiumion batteries (NIB) are an attractive complementary technology that shares a similar working 
principle and cell engineering to LIBs.3,4 Sodium has numerous advantages over Li in terms of 
abundance (23,000 ppm vs. 20 ppm in the earths crust), distribution, and cost, offering economic 
sustainability.5 However, one of the significant drawbacks of NIBs is their lower energy density than 
LIBs.
