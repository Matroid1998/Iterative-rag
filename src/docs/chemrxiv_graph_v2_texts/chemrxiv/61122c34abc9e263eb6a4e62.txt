Pesticides are widely used to improve agricultural production and control 
36 
various pests and disease vectors in public health. However, despite their many 
37 
benefits, excessive or improper application of pesticides in agricultural activity leads 
38 
to the pollution of soils and aqueous environments, which may produce a range of 
39 
hazardous effects to nontarget species such as humans and animals (Mojiri et al., 
40 
2020). 41 
Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are among the most commonly used 
42 
compounds to control pests for both agricultural and residential applications. Their 
43 
usage is still growing because of their high efficacy, a broad spectrum of activity, 
44 
multipest control capability, lack of pest resistance, and low cost (Wanjeri et al., 
45 
2018).
