Description:
Forms a perfectly covalent network in diamond with a three-dimensional arrangement in corner-sharing C4 tetrahedra.

Text:
Diamond, as natural gem and manmade for applications 1 is recognized as the hardest material. The basic reason for extreme hardness is the threedimensional arrangement of carbon in corner 
sharing C4 tetrahedra with d(CC)  1.55 , i.e. the sum of two r(C)  0.77  atomic radii, making 
a perfectly covalent network. In recent decades many research efforts were focused on the 
identification of new ultrahard carbon allotropes mimicking structure through predicting software 
such as CALYPSO 2 and USPEX 3 complementarily with first principles calculations carried 
out mainly within the wellestablished quantum mechanics framework of the density functional 
theory (DFT) 4,5. In this context the SACADA database (SACADA 3D) 6 regroups all known 
carbon allotropes thus helping researchers in their endeavor. Recently we reported bodycentered 
tetragonal C4 (Fig.

1a) proposed in space group I4m2 as seed to build larger carbon networks and 
to serve as a template for other original chemical compounds 7. Note that by considering the 
primitive cell (2 atoms), tetC4 is another expression of cubic diamond whose presentation as tetC4 
is shown here as a starting building block to propose a novel carbon allotrope. In Table 1 showing 
the crystal structure parameters of tetC4, the change of twofold carbon (2b) by fourfold position 
leading to the separation of the C4 tetrahedra along vertical direction keeps the same bodycentered 
tetragonal space group I4m2 after full geometry relaxation onto ground state structure leading to 
tetragonal C6 (Fig. 1b). The transformation scheme highlighting the C4 tetrahedra is proposed in 
Fig. 1c.
