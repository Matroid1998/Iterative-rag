Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction, which is slower than the hydrogen evolution reaction in water electrolysis.

Text:
Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) will 
be a cornerstone in the future energy transition, generating 
green hydrogen to end the reliance on current fossilbased 
energy carriers.1, 2 Here, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is 
profoundly more sluggish than the hydrogen evolution reaction 
(HER). Given that anodic and cathodic reactions proceed 
simultaneously, the slower reaction ultimately determines the 
total device efficiency, making the improvement of OER kinetics 
a main target of many research endeavors in the water splitting 
community. Electrocatalysts build the heart of electrochemical 
devices and act as reaction promoters. So far, IrOx has become 
the stateoftheart OER catalyst for PEMWEs.
