Description:
Divalent carbon species capable of forming two new covalent bonds via cyclopropanation or insertion reactions.

Text:
For example, a divalent carbon atom in carbenes can generate two 
new covalent bonds in a single step via cyclopropanation or insertion reactions.15 The 
development of suitable precursors and synthetic equivalents has led to significant advances in the 
synthetic chemistry of carbenes and carbynes, enabling the regulation of the high reactivity and
