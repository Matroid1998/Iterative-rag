Description:
Has a low gravimetric and volumetric energy density due to partial utilization of Ti4 redox centers.

However, Li4Ti5O12 has a low gravimetric and volumetric energy 
density due to its partial utilization of Ti4 redox centers, cycling between Li4Ti5O12 and Li7Ti5O12, 
and the necessity of nanosizing to enable highrate operation. The nanoparticle morphology also 
presents challenges for material scaleup and processing. Alternatives to Li4Ti5O12 that retain the 
excellent safety properties but overcome some of the disadvantages could enable wider penetration 
of highpower battery energy storage. Niobiumbased complex oxides have emerged as promising candidates for highrate anode 
materials due to the inherent stability and fast lithium diffusion within some common Nboxide 
structure types as well as the multiredox capability of niobium (i.e. Nb5 to Nb3).1 In this work, 
we explore Nb18W8O69 (9Nb2O58WO3)2, the tungstenrich end member of the xNb2O5yWO3 
homologous series.
