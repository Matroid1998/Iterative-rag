Description:
Short single-stranded DNA sequences used in aptamers.

Text:
DNA aptamers are short (10100 residues) singlestranded nucleotide (ssDNA) sequences. One 
popular use for DNA aptamers is as sensors or aptasensors for a wide variety of molecular 
ligands including antibiotics1, neurotransmitters2,3, steroids4, metals5, proteins6, 
nucleosides, including most famously ATP 7,8, and other small molecules 911. The 
advantage of aptasensors that makes them particularly attractive is the demonstrated potential for 
stable and selective sensing in crowded biochemical environments, e.g., in blood or in polluted 
water. The difficulty lies in designing sequences which reliably and selectively bind a desired 
target analyte. Promising aptasensor candidates are selected using the Systematic Evolution of 
Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol which iteratively enriches DNA libraries 
with sequences exhibiting preferential affinity toward a target ligand.
