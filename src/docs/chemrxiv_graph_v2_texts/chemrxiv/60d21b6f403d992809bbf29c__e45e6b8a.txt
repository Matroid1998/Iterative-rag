Description:
Electrophilic intermediates proposed to mediate nitrene transfer reactions.

Text:
Mn tetrapyrrolecatalyzed nitrene transfer catalysis has been applied to both CH amination and olefin 
aziridination reactions. Electrophilic Mn nitrenoids are proposed to mediate this family of nitrene transfer reactions. The reactivity of the Mn nitrenoids that are invoked as transient intermediates in nitrene 
transfer catalysis renders these species challenging to observe.7 Stabilization of these 
intermediates via synthetic modification of the ancillary ligand set can attenuate the reactivity of 
the supported Mn nitrenoid and enable isolation.
