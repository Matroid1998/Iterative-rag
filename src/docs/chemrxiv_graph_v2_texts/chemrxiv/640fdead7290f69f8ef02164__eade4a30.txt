A major element in the composition of both mango and human.

Text:
Like mango, a human also travels a journey in time from birth till aged human (older people) 
before the appearance of a human with wrinkled skin which includes birth, childhood, teen, adult, 
and then becomes an old person with wrinkled skin6, 7. Further, the basic composition of 
mango and human also remains the same i.e., majorly made of Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, 
Hydrogen, Calcium, Phosphorous, and Sulphur810. Moreover, the three major components 
of mango are very much similar to humans such as mango pit (endocarp, seed kernel) as human 
bones (skeletal system), the pulp (mesocarp) as human muscles, and the mango peel (epicarp) as 
human skin11.
