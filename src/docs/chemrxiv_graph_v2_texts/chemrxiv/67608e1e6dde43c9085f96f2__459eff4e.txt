Compounds with significant nonaromatic resonance structures.

of arenes in 
organic compounds. The resulting sp3rich analogues could in turn improve biological activity, metabolic stability 
and solubility, as illustrated in the examples in Fig. 1b5. More recently, impressive examples from Glorius and 
coworkers further underscores the importance of arene hydrogenation in analogue synthesis and drug discovery6. Despite that a number of elegant and efficient arene hydrogenation methods have been developed to date7, the 
control of siteselectivityselective saturation of one arene among many othersis still a formidable challenge. The current approaches primarily capitalize on moieties with less aromatic stability, such as heteroarenes and 
polycyclic arenes8, more significant nonaromatic resonance structures (e.g., phenols)9, or less steric hindrance10. It remains difficult to differentiate sterically and electronically unbiased benzene derivatives.
