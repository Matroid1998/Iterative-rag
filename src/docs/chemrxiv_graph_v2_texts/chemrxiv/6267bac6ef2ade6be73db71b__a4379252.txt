Description:
A family of compounds that include lead and are synthesized through phaseselective methods.

Text:
In this work, we exploit the formation of epitaxial heterostructures as a reactiondirecting step for the 
phaseselective synthesis of colloidal NCs, and we take advantage of this approach to further expand the 
family of lead chalcohalides.
