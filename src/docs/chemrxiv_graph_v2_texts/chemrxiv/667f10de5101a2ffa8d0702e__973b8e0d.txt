Description:
A (1, 3) glucan biopolymer closely related to cellulose, part of the polysaccharides family in plant cell walls.

Text:
Callose, a paradigmatic (1, 3) glucan biopolymer closely related to cellulose, is a minority
member of the broad family of polysaccharides that represent the major component of the
cell wall of plants.1 Depending on the origin, preparation and context, it assumes slightly
dierent forms of dierent name, with pachyman and curdlan being the most common ones.2,3
The similarity of callose with cellulose is due to the fact that they display virtually the same
linear primary structure (see Fig. 1).

Description:
A polysaccharide made in the plasma membrane of plant cells with a role in the plant cell wall.

Text:
Moreover, at variance from other polysaccharides such
as hemicellulose and pectin, both callose and cellulose are made in the plasma membrane of
plant cells, and their syntheses share their rst steps.1 Relatively unknown for several decades
after its discovery in 1863,4 the structure, natural synthesis pathway and biological functions of
callose have been elucidated mainly through studies of a suitable plant model, i.e., Arabidopsis
Thaliana.5
Despite their similarities, cellulose and callose play dierent roles in the plant cell wall.6,7 The
importance of calloses role, in particular, is emphasised by the fact that its abundance in the
cell wall is nely regulated by several genes,8,9 and its distribution changes with changing stages
in the life of the cell.

Description:
A polysaccharide that accumulates in developing pollen tubes, cell plates, plasmodesmata, sieve and companion cells, and as part of the plant's response to stress.

Text:
Then, the accumulation of callose is promoted by callose synthase (CalS),
and limited by 1, 3glucanase, that hydrolyses 1, 3glucosydic bonds.10 Variants of CalS
synthesize callose that accumulates in developing pollen tubes;11,12 cell plates, forming along
the new (double) cell wall which divides plant cells during mitosis;13,14 plasmodesmata,15,16
sieve and companion cells,17 representing important elements in cellcell transport and commu
nication. Besides these normalstate functions, callose accumulates as part of the plants response to
abiotic and biotic stress.
