Description:
A cofactor used by enzymes to catalyze asymmetric intermolecular radical CC couplings.

Text:
In 2023, through the cooperative interactions between the biocat
alyst and the smallmolecule photosensitizer, our group reported the 
first use of pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP)dependent enzymes to cat
alyze asymmetric intermolecular radical CC couplings which were 
not previously known in either organic chemistry or biochemistry.6a 
In this process, the key reactive radical intermediate forms photo
catalytically outside the enzyme active site and then travel into the 
active site, likely guided by hydrophobic interactions with the en
zyme pocket, for productive bond formation with an enzymatic in
termediate.6 By separating radical generation from enzymatic sub
strate activation, this new mechanism holds the potential to be gen
eralized to diverse enzyme families, including those lacking a redox
active cofactor.
