Description:
Produced via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a clean and renewable energy source.

Text:
Faced with the global energy crisis, we strive to reduce fossil fuel consumption and increase 
the usage of renewable energy sources 13. The electrochemical production of hydrogen via 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising way for obtaining clean and renewable energy 4. In alkaline solutions the HER mechanism involves water dissociation and subsequent hydrogen 
reduction and adsorption (H2O  e  Hads  OH), in the Volmer step, which is followed by, either 
the Heyrovsky step (Hads  H2O  e  H2  OH) or by the Tafel step (2Hads H2) 5. Recent 
improvements in the cost and performance of electrochemical water splitting technologies point 
towards a more economically viable future for their application at an industrial scale 6.

Description:
Produced via proton exchange membrane electrolysis and alkaline water electrolysis.

Text:
Currently, 
the two prevalent methods for obtaining hydrogen are protonexchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis 
7 and alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) 8. The hydrogen production efficiency of PEM 
electrolyzers is higher but requires Ptbased catalysts 9. In the case of AWE, the key goal is high 
catalytic activity and stability under intermittent polarization in alkaline media 10. It is well known 
that the HER rate in alkaline media is inferior to that in acidic ones 11, 12 because of the additional 
water dissociation step 13, precedes the discharge step, but also due to the blockage of active sites 
by adsorbed hydroxyl ions, but also partly due to hydroxyl ion adsorption resulting in the blockage of 
active sites 5.
