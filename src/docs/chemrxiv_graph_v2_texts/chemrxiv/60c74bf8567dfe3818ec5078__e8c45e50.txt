Description:
A prescription drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease that began crystallizing to an unknown polymorph in transdermal patches, which was thermodynamically more stable and less soluble than the original polymorph.

Thus, a given molecule
can have very different materials properties, depending on poly
morph, and control of crystal structure can be exploited in matters
as simple as improving the daily experience of eating chocolate13,
or as severe as preventing drug ineffectiveness1416. The role of CSP must be to predict all likely crystal structures,
along with a measure of their likelihood. There have been high
prole cases in the pharmaceutical industry where failing to antic
ipate polymorphism of a drug had serious consequences. In one
case, Rotigotine, a prescription for the treatment of Parkisons dis
ease, began crystallizing to an unknown polymorph in transder
mal patches14,15. This new form was thermodynamically more
stable than the original polymorph, less soluble, and thus less ef
cient.
