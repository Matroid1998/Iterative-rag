Description:
Acts as a Lewis base donor forming ion pairs with reactive MAO species.

Text:
Fairly recently, reactive MAO species were detected during the 
hydrolysis of Me3Al in polar solvent using the technique of ESI
MS. 12  This sensitive analytical technique relies on ionpair 
formation between reactive MAO species and a Lewis base donor 
such as (Me3SiO)2SiMe2 (OMTS). In sufficiently low amounts, 
OMTS reacts reversibly with MAO according to Scheme 1.9c,13
