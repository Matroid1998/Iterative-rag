Description:
A volatile or soluble species formed from the interaction of CO with Ni.

Text:
In partic
ular, CO can dissociate on Ni, leading to the formation of oxidic phases5 and carbides.69
This results in a modification of the chemical composition of the surface and also affects the
material via the formation of volatile or soluble species (such as Ni(CO)4).1012 Addition
ally, CO promotes adatoms under both thermal3,13 and electrocatalytical conditions5 on Cu
surfaces.
