Description:
Can receive a carbene ligand from dicopper carbene complexes.

Text:
For example, the group of Warren 
reported two dicopper carbene complexes in which each copper 
center is supported by a diketiminate ligand (Figure 1).13,14 They 
show that these complexes can transfer their carbene ligand to 
alkenes, phosphines and dioxygen. However, these complexes exist 
in equilibrium with their mononuclear carbene counterparts in 
solution, and it is proposed that the mononuclear carbene 
complexes are responsible for the observed carbene transfer 
reactivity. Similarly, the group of Hoffman reported a dicopper 
carbene complex supported by two iminophosphanamide ligands 
(Figure 1).15 This complex was found to react with alkenes to form 
the corresponding mononuclear carbene and alkene complexes, 
but no carbene transfer reactivity was reported.
