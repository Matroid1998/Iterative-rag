Description:
Show promising detection properties due to their lamellar crystal structure and high surface-to-volume ratio.

Oxide materials, such as those containing zinc 7,8, tin 2,9,10, and titanium 
11,12, have been widely investigated due to their good sensing properties, such as 
sensitivity, and fast response in the detection of toxic and flammable gases 13. However, 
in order to improve the response and recovery kinetics of these sensors, working 
temperatures above 200 C are required 2,14,15, greatly increasing the operation cost 
and power consumption. Alternatively, dichalcogenides of the SnSeS system have shown promising 
detection properties for various detection systems due to their lamellar crystal structure 
16,17. In these materials, chemically inert layers bonded by weak van der Waals 
interactions promote a high surfacetovolume ratio, exposing lone pair electrons in the 
(0 0 1) planes.
