Description:
Typically inert to chemical functionalization due to saturation of Mo atoms with chalcogen atoms.

They were first used to functionalize glassy carbon by Pinson 
et al. in 1992, which then opened up the prospect of surface modification of other 
materials using aryl diazonium salts 9. Recent reports have shown the importance in 
functionalizing MoS2 in enhancing their properties for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 
electronic and sensing applications 10, 11. However, 2HMoS2 is typically inert to 
chemical functionalization because its Mo atoms are saturated with chalcogen atoms and 
thus 2HMoS2 is difficult to functionalize directly 12, 13. As a consequence, the recent 
reports on the functionalization of 2HMoS2 include pretreatment of the flakes prior to 
functionalization. For example, Benson et al.
