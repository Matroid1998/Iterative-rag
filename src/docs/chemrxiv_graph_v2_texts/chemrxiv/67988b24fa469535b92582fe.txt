Description:
Involved in isotope labeling at sterically least hindered positions using iron-based catalysts.

Text:
Complementary regioselec
tivity was achieved by applying Lewis acidic catalysts, 
either homogeneous species such as B(C6F5)3 or hetero
geneous catalysts like Fecellulose1000, which target 
the electron rich positions within arenes.2628 However, 
the selectivity is substratecontrolled with a substrate 
scope limited to only electron rich arenes. An elegant ap
proach introduced recently is based on homogeneous 
ironbased catalysts which enable hydrogen isotope la
belling at sterically least hindered positions, even in the 
presence of directing groups (Figure 1B).2931 However, 
these systems suffer from limited functional group toler
ance, due to the high reactivity of iron hydrides.
