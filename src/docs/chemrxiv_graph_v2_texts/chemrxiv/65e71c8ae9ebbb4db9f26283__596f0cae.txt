Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and is targeted for removal by DAC technologies.

Text:
Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are projected to 
play a crucial role in addressing climate change by 
removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, 
allowing us to mitigate the longterm consequences of 
existing atmospheric carbon dioxide and achieve netzero 
emissions.1, 2 The key component in DAC technologies is 
the material used to capture and separate CO2 from the air.
