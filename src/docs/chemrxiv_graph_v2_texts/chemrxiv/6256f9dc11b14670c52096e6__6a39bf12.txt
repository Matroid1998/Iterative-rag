Description:
Synthetic polymers used in a variety of products, derived from petroleum.

Text:
Plastics, the macromolecular materials found in a wide variety of products ranging from grocery bags to 
car bumpers, are composed predominantly of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polyesters and 
polyamides, along with small amounts of additives including plasticizers, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, 
etc. An estimated 368 million tons of plastics were produced in 2020.1 Most synthetic polymers in use 
today are derived from petroleum. Monomers, the building blocks of polymers, are currently obtained 
directly from crude oil refining or synthesized from refining products. It is estimated that plastic
manufacturing processes consume 810 of the global oil supply,2 and the number is forecast to double 
by 2040.3 Petroleum is nonrenewable, and the oil resources are rapidly being depleted from planet earth.
