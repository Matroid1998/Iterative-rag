Metalhalide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as highly promising materials due to their 
exceptional properties and versatile applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and 
photocatalysis.1,2 These compounds possess exceptional optical and electronic properties, 
including a high absorption coefficient, a direct and tunable bandgap, long carrier diffusion 
lengths, high charge mobility, and low recombination losses.3 The general crystal structure of 
MHPs is ABX3, where A is typically an organic or inorganic cation (Methylammonium, Cs or 
Rb), B is a metal cation (Pb or Sn), and X is a halide anion (Br, I, or Cl).3 The structure consists 
of BX octahedra, with the B cation at the center and the A cation occupying a 12fold 
coordinated site.
