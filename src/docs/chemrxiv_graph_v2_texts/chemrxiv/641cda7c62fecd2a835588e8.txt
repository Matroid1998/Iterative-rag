Description:
A boron-rich chalcogenide synthesized at high pressures and high temperatures.

Boronrich solids are compounds with unusual structures. Almost all of them contain B12 
icosahedral units and various interstitial atoms (ranging from nonmetals to metals) 13. Such 
structures make boronrich compounds extremely stable, resulting in high (up to 2700 K) melting 
temperatures, chemical inertness and excellent mechanical properties 14. These properties of 
icosahedral boronrich solids suggest that they will find many new applications. The extensive 
study of existing materials and the search for new boronrich compounds are therefore of great 
importance and receive considerable attention in experimental and theoretical science. Recently, two new boronrich chalcogenides, B6Se and B6S, have been synthesized at high 
pressures and high temperatures 5.
