Description:
Generally synthesized from benzyl electrophiles or through direct coupling from benzylic alcohols.

Text:
For example, diarylmethanes are generally synthesized 
from benzyl electrophiles, but recently, a direct coupling from ben
zyl alcohol, which is a readily available starting material, has been 
reported. Shu and coworkers discovered a nickelcatalyzed direct 
crosscoupling of benzylic alcohols with aryl triflates in the pres
ence of DMO (dimethyl oxalate) to afford the corresponding dia
rylmethanes.11 Masarwa and coworkers reported a unique synthetic 
method of triarylmethanes from aldehydes12 an aldehyde was 
mixed with an arene and triphenylphosphine in the presence of 
TfOH to generate a diarylphosphonium salt, followed by another 
arene in one pot to furnish the corresponding triarylmethane. This 
simple operation allowed for a onepot synthesis of triarylmethanes 
from aldehydes, but this method is limited to the use of electron
rich arenes.

Text:
Walsh and 
coworkers demonstrated a straightforward synthesis of tetraarylme
thanes from diarylmethanes.15 After deprotonation of the diarylme
thane with a base (KOtBu), two further arenes can be introduced 
by palladiumcatalyzed CH arylations with aryl chlorides. A varie
ty of tetraarylmethanes can be synthesized, although an electron
deficient heteroarene (a pyridine moiety) is required for one of the 
aromatic rings of the diarylmethane. While various syntheses of 
multiply arylated alkanes have been reported, thus far, there is no 
unified synthetic protocol from the same starting materials.
