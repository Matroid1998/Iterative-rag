Description:
Used as an electrocatalyst in PEMFCs, essential for both HOR and ORR.

Text:
Although the electrocatalyst is essential for both the anodic hydrogen 
oxidation reaction (HOR) and the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),9 the cathode 
requires many times higher amount of the Ptbased electrocatalyst than the anode resulting 
from significantly slower kinetics of the ORR.11 On the other hand, although there are various 
very important studies about nonprecious group metal (nonPGM) electrocatalysts,1215 in 
reality the only electrocatalyst applied at the production level for PEMFCs used for transport 
applications is still the Ptbased electrocatalyst.16,17 Due to a very high price of deficient Pt, it 
represents almost half of the total costs of the PEMFC system manufacturing,18 even when 
considering the economies of scale.19 One of the most promising approaches to reduce both the 
quantity of Pt per vehicle as well as the costs related to platinum per PEMFC system is to alloy 
Pt with a less noble and at the same time less expensive metal (M  Co, Cu, Fe or Ni),16,2024 
which enables better Pt utilization, i.e.
