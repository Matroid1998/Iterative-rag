Description:
Serves as a base in CH activation via cross coupling between aryl iodidesbromides and arenes.

In 
some cases, they have been seen as proton shuttles.16It has also been hypothesized in some 
instances that the additive could hydrogen bond with one of the substrates.17However, 
researchers have wondered whether additives could have a more active, defined role in 
increasing the efficiency of organocatalytic systems.18 
Such a possibility seems particularly pertinent when one considers the beneficial effect one 
additive class that of aromatic additives, have played in organocatalytic systems. CH activation 
via cross coupling between aryl iodidesbromides and the CH bonds of arenes, mediated solely 
by the presence of 1,10phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of potassium tertbutoxide as a 
base, studied by Shi and coworkers,19 for instance, was seen to benefit from the presence of 1,10
