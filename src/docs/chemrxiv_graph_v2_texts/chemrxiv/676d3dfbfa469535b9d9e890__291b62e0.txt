Description:
A benchmark catalyst in the classical OER mechanism.

Text:
For instance, the final oxygen desorption step has been identified as potentially ratelimiting 
or even inhibiting in the classical OER mechanism, particularly on benchmark catalysts like IrO2 5 leading 
to the proposal of novel reaction mechanisms to circumvent this bottleneck, emphasizing the need for a 
clearer understanding of OER kinetics. Several strategies have been explored to enhance OER rates and overall catalytic performance. These 
include structural regulation of catalysts through size engineering, defect engineering, field manipulation, 
phase engineering, and heterojunction engineering 6. Additionally, doping of singleatom substrates with 
single atom has shown promise in improving OER performance 6.
