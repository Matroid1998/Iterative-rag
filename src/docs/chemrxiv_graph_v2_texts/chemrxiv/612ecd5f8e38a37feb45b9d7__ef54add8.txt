Description:
Used in copolymerization with ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2propenoates.

Text:
Synthetic manipulation of polymer substrates via copolymerization is one of the oldest and 
most reliable methods to increase the functional diversity of soft materials 1. Ring
substituted ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2propenoates (ECPP), RPhCHC(CN)CO2C2H5 
continue to attract attention as comonomers for modification of commercial polymers. Ring 
unsubstituted ECPP has been copolymerized with acrylonitrile 2, styrene 3, vinyl acetate 
4, 5, acrylic esters 6, and 1,2ethanediyl ester of 2methylpropenoic acid 7. Terpolymerization of ECPP was reported with acrylonitrile and styrene 8, and ethyl 
acrylate and styrene 9. Also reported are curable adhesive and coating compositions 
containing trifunctional olefinic monomers, including ECPP 10.

Used in copolymerization studies with ethyl 2cyano 3phenyl2propenoates.

Text:
In continuation of our exploration of synthesis and radical copolymerization of esters 
2cyano3phenyl2propenoic acid, we have prepared alkyl ringsubstituted ethyl 2cyano
3phenyl2propenoates, RPhCHC(CN)CO2C2H5 (ECPP), where R is 2methyl, 3methyl, 
4methyl, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl, 1,1,1trifluoro4methyl, 1,1,1trifluoro2methyl, 
and explore the feasibility of their copolymerization with vinyl acetate. There are reports of 
syntheses of 2methyl, 3methyl, 4methyl 11, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl 12, 4
trifluoromethyl 13, and 2trifluoromethyl 14 ringsubstituted ECPP. To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no reports on copolymerization of these ethyl 2cyano3
phenyl2propenoates with vinyl acetate 15. 2 Experimental

2.1 Materials 
2Methyl, 3methyl, 4methyl, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl, 4trifluoromethyl, 2
trifluoromethyl  substituted benzaldehydes, propyl cyanoacetate, piperidine, vinyl acetate, 
1,1azobiscyclohexanecarbonitrile, (ABCN), and toluene supplied from SigmaAldrich 
Co., were used as received.
