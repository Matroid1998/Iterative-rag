Involved in reversible addition to metal sites, fundamental in catalysis.

Text:
The reversible addition of H2 to metal sites is a fundamental step in catalysis. The importance 
of the reversibility of this step is perhaps most clearly illustrated in hydrogenfordeuterium 
(HD) exchange reactions. In its simplest form, HDexchange involves the selective isotopic 
labelling of molecules through reaction with D2. Catalysts which promote this type of HD
exchange must be capable of reversible activation of H2 (and its isotopomers). 2 
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of transition metal complexes 
bearing main group ligands for small molecule activation. Several systems incorporating B,1
8 AlIn,912, Zn1315 and Sn16 ligands have been reported for H2 activation.17 A number of 
potential mechanisms for H2 activation, some of which involve cooperative behaviour of the 
main group Scheme 1.

Involved in reversible reactions with various metal complexes.

Text:
Reversible reaction of 1 with H2 to form PdMg and 22 ligand, have 
been discussed.18 Defined examples of reversible behaviour are more limited, the majority of 
these involve boronbased ligands. For example, SaboEtienne and coworkers reported the 
reversible addition of H2 to a ruthenium complex supported by a borylene ligand.19 Peters and 
coworkers documented reversible reactions of H2 to a nickelborane, ironborane, and cobalt
borane complexes.2,46 More recently, Okuda and coworkers reported the reversible reaction 
of H2 with a GaZn compound, mediated by changes in solvent polarity.20 Reversible 
dihydrogen activation by these systems offers a potential approach to catalytic HDexchange. However, reports of such reactivity are limited.
