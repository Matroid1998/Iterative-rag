Description:
Compounds that lend very high thermal stability to the metastable cis isomers owing to their unique T-shaped conformation and produce quantitative isomerization yields in both directions.

In order to overcome the first 
two drawbacks, arylazopyrazoles have been investigated as MOST materials by sever 
research laboratories as these compounds lend very high thermal stability to the metastable 
cis isomers owing to their unique Tshaped conformation and produce quantitative 
isomerization yields in both directions.16 To improve the energy storage density of azobased
