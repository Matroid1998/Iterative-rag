Description:
The most active derivative capable of regenerating regioselectively 1,4NADH in aqueous media using high concentrations of formate as hydride source.

Text:
TH reactions in aqueous media were not reported until the mid 1980s1, and the presence of water 
seemed to increase catalytic rates, thus, allowing the use of more environmentally friendly solvents. In 1991, 
Steckhan et al. developed the first series of TH metal catalysts  with CpRh(bipy)Cl (bipy  2,2bipyridyl, 
Figure 1)  being the most active derivative  capable of regenerating regioselectively 1,4NADH in aqueous 
media (pH 7, 37 C) using high concentrations of formate as hydride source2. In 2001, Fish et al. obtained 
structureactivity relationships on CpRh(bipy)Cl and derivatives and obtained initial insights into the 
mechanisms of NADH cofactor regeneration3. In 2006, Sadler et al. proposed to exploit the TH properties of 
Ru(II)arene complexes of general formula (6 arene)Ru(X,Y)ClPF6 (X,Y  ethylendiamine, bipy, or 
acetylacetone, Figure 1) to regenerate NADH4.

Description:
A complex studied for its catalytic cycle behavior.

Text:
Using this strategy, the concentration of NAD as well as the 
NADNADH ratio could be altered, potentially interfering with numerous processes highly controlled in cancer 
cells, such as energy regulation, DNA repair and transcription, or immunological functions5, 6. The catalytic 
cycle was also studied, showing similar behaviour to complex CpRh(bipy)Cl. Thus, a number of Ru(II)
arene compounds were further developed7. Afterwards, a series of neutral Ru(II) halfsandwich complexes, 
whereby the choice of the arene and of the chelating ligand has a major effect on the catalytic activity, were 
shown to regioselectively catalyse the TH of NAD 811, and to be able to perform the reaction in cellular 
environment12.
