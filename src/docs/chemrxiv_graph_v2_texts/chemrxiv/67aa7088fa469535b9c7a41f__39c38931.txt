CoII complexes containing a TREN unit, whether embedded within a macrocyclic structure or 
not, have been widely reported over the last few decades, encompassing a variety of structures 
and interesting properties. These CoIITRENbased complexes have been studied for 
applications such as CO2 uptake9 and reduction10 CO2 and O2 transport,11 and nitric oxide 
activation.12 These remarkable properties of CoIITRENbased complexes have strongly 
motivated our exploration of the coordination chemistry of CoII confined within the macrocyclic 
structures offered by the CalixTRENX ligands. This article presents the synthesis, the 
comprehensive chemical and structural characterization of these CoII funnel complexes as well 
as a single crystal to single crystal hostguest exchange.
