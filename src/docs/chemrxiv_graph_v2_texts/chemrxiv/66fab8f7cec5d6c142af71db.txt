Description:
A perfluorinated polymer backbone functionalized with sulfonic acid groups.

For the last sixty years, research in protonexchangemembrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has benefit 
from Nafion membranes, which have been developed by Walther Grot and patented by DuPont.1 
In 2023, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) proposed a ban for per and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances, including Nafion, whose chemical structure is based on a perfluorinated polymer 
backbone functionalized with sulfonic acid groups.2 This potential restriction on Nafion could 
benefit hydrocarbonbased anion conducting polyelectrolytes, which are cheaper and safer to 
produce.3 The progress in anion conducting polyelectrolyte development over the past twenty 
years has accelerated research on alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs).4 In
