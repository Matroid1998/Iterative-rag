Widely employed by industry as a precursor for dyes, agrochemicals, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and 
methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, an intermediate in polyurethane manufacture, aniline (benzenamine) is 
globally manufactured at 7 million ta rate. Demand is strong and production growing at 5.3 compound 
annual growth rate.1 The industrial process employs the heterogeneously catalyzed nitrobenzene (NB) hy
drogenation carried out either in vapor phase or in in liquid phase.

Description:
Involved in a reaction mechanism where it is converted to nitrosobenzene.

Text:
In the vapor phase process NB is fed 
with hydrogen into a tubular reactor containing a supported Cu catalyst at 270 290 C and 15 bar in the 
presence of a 91 (H2NB) excess of hydrogen.2 In the liquid phase process, the capability for utilization of 
reaction heat (more than 500 kJ mol1) is much higher due to higher heat transfer coefficient, and supported 
noble metals (palladium and platinum) are employed.3 
Given the industrial and economic relevance of the process, plentiful academic and industrial research is 
still conducted today to improve the existing processes.4 In 2005, Jackson in collaboration with catalysis 
industrys researchers demonstrated that the Habers threestep reaction mechanism (aniline converted to 
nitrosobenzene, the latter to phenylhydroxylamine, and phenylhydroxylamine to aniline) is wrong.5 The 
newly suggested reaction mechanism indicates formation of PhN(OH) (nitrobenzene) as surface interme
diate.

Description:
Formed from the reaction of PhN(OH) with hydrogen.

Text:
In said mechanism, PhN(OH) either reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form aniline, or PhN(OH) 
reacts with itself to eliminate water and produce azoxybenzene.5 
Ideally, hydrogenation of NB to aniline at completion would be carried out in liquidphase at low tempera
ture over a solid catalyst employing earthabundant and lowcost Ni in place of Pt or Pd. So far, to the 
best of our knowledge, no such catalyst has been reported.

Description:
The product of the hydrogenation of NB using a Pt-loaded Nigraphene catalyst.

Text:
Recently, for example, scholars in China re
ported a new Ptloaded Nigraphene magnetically separable catalyst (PtNiNG) at a Pt weight loading 
of 0.3 exhibiting excellent activity for the hydrogenation of NB to aniline achieving a turnover frequency 
of 27,240 h1 at 1 MPa reaction pressure and room temperature.6 Remarkably, the catalyst retained its 
selective activity over five consecutive testing cycles.

Description:
A product formed from the reduction of nitrosobenzene.

Text:
In another attempt, a catalyst comprised of 3.7 nm 
Ni nanoparticles dispersed on silica, though more active than Raney Ni, required 90 C because formation 
of aniline only begins when the conversion of the strongly adsorbed nitrosobenzene intermediate is higher 
than 90.7 
In the following, we describe the high and stable activity in the NB reduction to aniline of the reduced form 
(RGONi) of NiGraf, a newly developed metal organic alloy (MORAL) comprised of graphene oxide en
trapped within Ni nanoparticles (GONi).8 Actually consisting of Ni nanoparticles encapsulating GO plate
lets,9 this new class of Nibased catalysts is reproducibly and efficiently obtained through the MORAL 
approach first introduced by Avnir in 2002.10 Since then, widely different molecularly doped metals were 
applied as enhanced catalysts to numerous catalytic conversions.11 Yet, their uptake in catalysis science 
and technology in the subsequent two decades remained surprisingly low, even though metal species
