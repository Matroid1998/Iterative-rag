Description:
Atoms are represented in blue color in the TiO2 cluster.

Text:
The 
current study involves methane to ethane conversion 
via solar energy driven process on TiO2 nano cluster as 
the photocatalyst The TiO2 nano cluster used in our 
study was taken from anatase TiO2.19 The anatase 
TiO2 with (001) facet has been shown to be more active
