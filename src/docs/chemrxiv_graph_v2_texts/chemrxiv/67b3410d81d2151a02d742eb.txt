Description:
Electroactive organic molecules screened for high-performance candidates in advanced aqueous organic redox flow batteries.

Text:
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are an emerging energy storage technology characterized
by decoupled power and energy components, rendering them particularly suitable for
longduration storage 13. However, the availability, cost, and environmental burden
associated with mining of the metal ore have impelled the search of new electroactive
energy storage materials 4. Electroactive organic molecules, like quinones, alloxazines,
and phenazines, have been extensively screened for highperformance candidates in
advanced aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) due to their advantages for
achieving lowcost synthesis at scale, structural diversity, and tailorability 57. Datadriven workflows, empowered by algorithms, computational tools, and
machine learning (ML) models, have been comprehensively applied in material dis
covery 810.
