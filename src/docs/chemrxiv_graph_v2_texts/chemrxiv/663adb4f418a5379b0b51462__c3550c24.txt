Description:
The most popular acrylic precursor for manufacturing carbon fibers.

Text:
The widely used precursors for manufacturing carbon fibers include acrylic, cellulosic, and 
pitchbased precursors1. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is the most popular acrylic precursor. In 
early 2016, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) began seeking licensees for a new, cost
effective method for producing carbon fiber from PAN. The new method has demonstrated 
the potential to reduce the cost of carbon fiber by as much as 50 relative to the lowestcost 
industrialgrade carbon fiber2. This achievement was heralded as one of the most significant 
developments in carbon fiber production since the 1960s3. The use of cellulose as a precursor 
for making carbon fibers was first demonstrated by Thomas Edison in the 1880s for his 
revolutionary electric lamp filament1. To date, rayon has been the widely used cellulosic 
precursor.

Description:
A precursor for carbon fibers known for higher strength and failure strain.

Text:
Rayonbased carbon fibers are used predominantly for ablative applications such 
as reentry vehicle nose tips, heat shields, and solidrocket motor nozzles. These applications 
require high thermal resistance but relatively low mechanical strength4. Today, over 90 of carbon fibers are based on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor, while the 
remaining fibers are mainly pitchbased carbon fibers produced through meltspinning. While 
PANbased carbon fibers show higher strength and failure strain, pitchbased carbon fibers 
are known to be less expensive and offer a higher modulus. The pitch precursor has a lower 
cost, higher char yield, and a higher degree of microstructural orientation. Pitches are 
complex blends of polycyclic aromatic molecules and heterocyclic compounds that can 
contain more than 80 carbon. The composition of pitches varies with the source and 
processing conditions.
