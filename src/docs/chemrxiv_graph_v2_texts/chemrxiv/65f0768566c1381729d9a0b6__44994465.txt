Description:
Polymethine dyes with seven methine units, known for favorable near-infrared excitation and emission properties suitable for in vivo imaging.

Text:
Polymethine dyes, characterized by two heterocycles 
connected by odd numbers of methine units, are a major 
family of dyes with more than 150 years of history.1 In 
particular, heptamethine fluorophores, which are the 
polymethine dyes with seven methine units (Figure 1), 
have gained significant interest due to their favorable 
nearinfrared (NIR, 7001000 nm) excitation and emission 
properties that enable deeper penetration and reduced 
background than visible fluorophores, making them high
ly suitable for in vivo imaging applications.

Description:
Dyes with planar conjugated systems that tend to aggregate nonemissively and have little solubility in water.

Text:
In particular, the planar conjugated sys
tems in heptamethine dyes result in strong tendency to
wards nonemissive aggregation with little solubility in 
water, which requires the modification with hydrophilic 
groups andor steric bulk to allow their imaging in aque
ous conditions.912 Additionally, the stability of heptame
thine dyes can introduce complexity in their imaging ap
plications. For example, heptamethine dyes are photo
bleached relatively fast under illumination compared to 
other family of fluorophores,13,14 and many, including ICG, 
have been reported to degrade in the presence of physio
logical nucleophiles or even in simple aqueous solu
tions.1012,15,16 While these limitations can be partially over
come by using formulation methods, the heterogeneous 
nature of formulation brings about batchtobatch varia
tions as well as potential in vivo instability.

Description:
Dyes that require structural modification to enhance their physical and chemical properties for biological applications.

Text:
Therefore, 
structural modification of heptamethine fluorophores is 
often essential to enhance their physical and chemical 
properties for reliable biological applications in physio
logical conditions. Despite the necessity of heptamethine dye modifica
tions, the limited scope of modification methods remains 
as a hurdle to even broader utilization of these fluoro
phores.

Description:
Dyes that focus on the replacement of the center chloride.

Text:
In this context, latestage functionalization of 
existing heptamethine dyes primarily focuses on the re
placement of center chloride in the popular 4chloro hep
tamethine scaffold, which is synthesized from the con
densation between two heterocyclic salt moiety and an 
accessible Schiff base bearing the chloride (Figure 1).58,17 
Such replacement can take place via the substitution reac
tion with N, O or S nucleophiles, whose products can be 
labile under physiological conditions,1823 or coupling re
actions to form robust CC bonds, although the conver
sion usually requires high temperature and prolonged 
reaction time that can be harmful to the fluorophore 
(Figure 1).24,25 On the other hand, more complex modifica
tion on the polymethine chain, including bulky 4
substitutions or substitutions on other positions, requires 
the bottomup synthesis of the fluorophore core, such as
