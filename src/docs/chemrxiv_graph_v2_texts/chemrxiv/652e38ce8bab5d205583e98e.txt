Description:
Predominates in bioactive molecules as part of nitrogen-containing functional groups.

The modern pharmaceutical industry is increasingly focused on sustainable production 
processes and innovative technologies that minimize environmental impacts1 and comply 
with green chemistry principles.2 Mechanochemistry,36 an essentially solventfree 
technique, has shown great potential as a powerful tool for advancing the sustainability 
goals in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).711 By eliminating 
solvents from the production chain, mechanochemistry can offer improved safety profiles 
and minimize the amount of generated waste,12 as solvents can account for up to 90 of 
the total mass consumed and are major contributors to the overall toxicity profile in a 
typical industrial process.13 
Nitrogencontaining functional groups predominate in bioactive molecules14 and carbon
nitrogen (CN) bondforming reactions are widely used in the synthesis of APIs.

Description:
Involved in about 80% of all heteroatom alkylation and arylation reactions in drug synthesis.

For 
instance, nitrogen atom derivatizations are involved in about 80 of all heteroatom 
alkylation and arylation reactions in the synthesis of drug candidates.15 Thus, the 
development of sustainable amidecoupling techniques along with the direct nucleophilic 
substitution of alcohols (e.g., for preparation of amines) have been listed among the top 
green chemistry research priorities by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry 
Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR).16 Advances in employing mechanochemistry 
for constructing CN bonds relevant to API synthesis, including the preparation of 
hydantoin derivatives,1722 amides,2326 bioactive peptides,27,28 aliphatic and aromatic 
amines,2934 sulfonylurea drugs,35,36 hydrazones,37 and sydnones38 have been described in 
the literature.
