Description:
A sensitive material that can affect the compatibility of imine-based condensation reactions.

Text:
Iminebased CPs have been previously synthesized using condensation 
reactions and are an important foundational material within the field,16 however these reactions 

2 
are not compatible with other water or oxygen sensitive materials and have therefore remained 
inaccessible for a variety of applications. The novel imine metathesis reaction that we have 
developed is a universal approach that is compatible with materials that are unstable to these 
conditions.
