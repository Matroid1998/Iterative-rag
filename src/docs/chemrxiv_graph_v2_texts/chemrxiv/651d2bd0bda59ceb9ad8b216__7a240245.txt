Description:
A precursor pollutant that contributes to the formation of secondary particles in the atmosphere.

While some PM

is directly emitted into the atmosphere as primary particles (e.g., dust, soot from combustion processes) 
19 
1,2, others are formed in the atmosphere from emissions of certain precursor pollutants such as SO2, NOX, 
20 
NH3 3,4 Therefore, PM can consist of both primary particles and those formed because of secondary 
21 
processes. This diverse nature of PM makes its characterization and analysis essential for understanding and 
22 
mitigating environmental pollution. PM can interact with other atmospheric components and can be 
23 
associated with the formation of certain secondary pollutants, such as groundlevel ozone and some harmful 
24 
gases. These pollutants contribute to the deterioration of air quality, leading to smog, haze, and reduced
