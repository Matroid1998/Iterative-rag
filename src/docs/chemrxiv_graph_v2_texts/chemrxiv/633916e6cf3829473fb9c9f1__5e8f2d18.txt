Description:
A cathode material used in composite cathodes with voltage cutoffs typically exceeding 4 V.

Polyethylene oxide or glycol (PEOPEG) is the archetypal polymer 
electrolyte and has been studied for over four decades.1517 However, PEO still suffers from low room 
temperature ionic conductivity (105 Scm)17 and poor oxidative stability (4 V vs LiLi)18, preventing its 
use either as a standalone SSE or as part of a cathode composite where voltages cutoffs typically exceed 4 
VLi (e.g., with LiCoO2, LiNixMnyCozO2). The oxidative challenges facing PEO also plague small ether 
molecules.19 New polymer backbone chemistries that do not require the ether group for ion conduction are 
needed.
