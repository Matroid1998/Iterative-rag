Description:
An amine donor used in chemical processes that may require protein engineering to enhance enzyme tolerance.

Text:
One approach is to load a vast excess of amine donor, such as isopropylamine (IPAm), but this often requires protein 
engineering to bolster the enzymes tolerance to the donor or its resultant ketone.11,12 Another approach is to dynamically 
remove the donor byproduct by either evaporation or enzymatic degradation, but these strategies increase the operational 
complexity.3 A third approach, and a promising alternative to the former two, is to deploy smart amine donors that, upon
