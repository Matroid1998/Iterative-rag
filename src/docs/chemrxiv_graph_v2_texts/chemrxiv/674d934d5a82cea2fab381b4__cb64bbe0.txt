Description:
Semiconductors used for light harvesting applications with high photovoltaic energy conversion efficiencies.

Text:
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors have emerged as excellent materials for light harvesting applications, with 
photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion efficiencies of labbased cells increasing rapidly from 3.8 in 20091 to 26.7 
today.2,3 Single and multijunction perovskite PV modules can exhibit a very small energy payback time of 0.09 years and 
a greenhouse gas emission factor as low as 13.4 g CO2 equivalent per kWh, which compare favourably to other 
technologies including marketleading silicon cells.4 Perovskitebased technologies can therefore play a key part in 
achieving societys decarbonisation goals.
