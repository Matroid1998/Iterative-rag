Description:
An inexpensive organic polymer used in adhesives and hydrogel preparation.

Text:
Used as a glue for more than 70 years, resorcinolfromaldehyde
resins (RFs) are inexpensive organic polymers synthesized
by condensation between formaldhyde and resorcinol. They
are now widely used as adhesives, 1 for hydrogels and aero
gel preparation 2,3. Pioneering work carried out by Zhang
et al. 4 in 2015 let to the discovery of semiconductive and
photocatalytic properties of RFs, and since then, various
works highlighted the efficiency of RFs for photodegrada
tion of organic pollutants, 49, water oxidation 4, enzyme
like activities 10,11, H2O2 production. 9,1218. Efforts have
been made to control the semiconductive properties and
morphology of RF resins, by varying synthetic conditions,
tailoring, organic or metal doping.

Description:
Contains aromatic hydroxyl groups and is used in the synthesis of ionic compounds.

Text:
Since both resorcinol and RF particles exhibit protic sites
(aromatic hydroxyl groups), we therefore propose to use
this methodology to pre or postfunctionalize RF resins. The prefunctionalization consists first in the synthesis of
the new ionic compound butylmethylimidazolium resorci
nate C1C4ImRes from commercial butyl methylimida
zolium methylcarbonate C1C4ImMeOCO2 and resorci
nol, and then use it as precursor for the polycondensation
with formaldehyde to obtain C1C4ImRF (Fig. 1, a). The
post functionalization of RF consists in the direct reaction
of C1C4ImMeOCO2 with the RFs to obtain C1C4ImRF
(Fig. 1, b). Figure
