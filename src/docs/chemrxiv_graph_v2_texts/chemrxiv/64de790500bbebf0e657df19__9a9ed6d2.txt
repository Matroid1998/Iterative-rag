Description:
Utilized as a photoswitch in MOST materials.

Text:
A variety of 
photoswitches, such as norbornadienequadricyclane,57 dihydroazulenevinylheptafulvene,89 
fulvalene diruthenium,1011 and azobenzene,1215 have been exploited as MOST materials. However, the azobased MOSTs systems attracted the most due to their robust bidirectional 
photoisomerization under nearvisible and visible range (350450 nm) and impressive 
photostability. Nonetheless, azobenzenes generally suffer from three limitations that restrict 
their practical use as MOST materials. The first one is the short halflives of the charged 
state, meaning energy cannot be stored for longer time duration. The second is the incomplete 
cistrans reverse isomerization leading to a less effective discharging process. The other one 
is their incapability to produce high energy storage densities.
