Description:
Used to trigger the release of biological epitopes by exploiting pH-dependent binding affinities.

Text:
used boronic acid esters to trigger the release of biological epitopes either using a competitor, 
or by exploiting pHdepending binding affinities.21 
Iminetype DCvC (reversible reaction between an aldehyde and amine) has become 
increasingly popular for tuning the viscoelastic timescales of soft biomaterials.22 The inherent 
differences in molecular equilibrium and rate constants between different types of crosslinking 
bonds such as oxime, semicarbazone, or hydrazone allow the engineering of hydrogel properties 
(i.e. stiffness, stressrelaxation, (bio)printability).2224 Notably, the chemical design space of such 
dynamic polymeric hydrogels is limited to telechelic synthetic systems or pendentmainchain 
modifications of natural polymers.
