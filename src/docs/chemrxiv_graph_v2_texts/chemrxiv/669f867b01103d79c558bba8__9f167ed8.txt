Description:
A naphthalene derivative used in photooxygenation with less stable EPOs.

Text:
Compared to previously published literature,23 effective improvements were 
achieved in the photooxygenation of mono and disubstituted anthracene derivatives, namely 4
(anthracen9yl)benzoic acid, ANBA, and 4(10phenylanthracen9yl)benzoic acid, PABA, respectively, 
forming more stable EPOs compared to the analogous naphthalenederivatives, 4(naphthalen1
yl)benzoic acid, NABA, and 4(4phenylnaphthalen1yl)benzoic acid, PNBA. Out of four, only PABAO2 
was found to release O2 effectively, when heated at 90 C for a prolonged time. Herein, computational and crystallographic data were used to select the most suitable structural 
features to improve the ORA performances in terms of EPO formation and O2 release. For the first time, 
the synthesis of anthracenebased EPOs bearing carefully selected substituents was carried out using 
a continuous flow photochemical reactor allowing to envisage the industrial scale up of the 
photooxygenation step (Figure S1).
