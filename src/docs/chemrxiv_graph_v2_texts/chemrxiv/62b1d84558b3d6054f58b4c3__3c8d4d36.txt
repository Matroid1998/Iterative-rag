Description:
The first metalcone films were Al based and were known as alucones.

Metalcones are known to be flexible in nature due to the flexible organic backbones 
present in their architectures and with excellent mechanical properties at the atomic and molecular level 
arising from the organometallic precursors.1617 The first metalcone films were Al based and were 
known as alucones.181920 Soon after, other metalcone groups were developed, such as the Ti, 
Zn, Hf, Mg and V based metalcones known as titanicones, zincones,2122hafnicones,23 
magnesicones24 and vanadicones25 respectively. While other organic backbones, e.g. aromatic 
rings, have been used, the field tends to use the term metalcone as a general description for these 
hybrid materials. One of the most extensively researched metalcones are titanicones.
