Description:
Reacts with ferrous ions in the Fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals.

Text:
This study focuses on the optimal conditions for the Fenton reaction and the reliability of UVVis spectroscopy. The 
Fenton reaction is a reaction between ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide that produces hydroxyl radicals, hydroxide 
ions, and ferric ions 2. 

! ! ! In this study, experiments were performed involving the Fenton reaction with a goal of determining the optimal pH 
and temperature in which the most radicals were produced. This allows for a greater understanding of the extent to 
which this reaction occurs in human bodies and how the byproducts of radiolysis may interact with biological 
systems as illustrated below. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20238w46qv3 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000280427516 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
