Description:
A charge-neutral lipid involved in membrane asymmetry studies.

Recently,
the impact of an asymmetric transbilayer distribution of lipidsa
hallmark of all plasma membraneson membrane protein func
tion has garnered significant scientific interest6. In this Communication, we revisit the effect of membrane
asymmetry on the outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA). OmpLA is a wellcharacterized membrane enzyme with an an
tiparallel barrel fold, which hydrolyzes phospholipids upon
dimerization in both native and artificial membranes7. Previ
ously we demonstrated that OmpLA activity could be alloster
ically modulated by differential lateral curvature stress emerg
ing from differently composed membrane leaflets8. Specifically,
we observed a slowing down of the hydrolysis kinetics in bilay
ers composed of the chargeneutral lipids 1palmitoyl2oleoyl
snglycero3phosphocholine (POPC) and 1palmitoyl2oleoyl
snglycero3phosphoethanolamine (POPE) with increasing com
positional asymmetry between the two membrane leaflets.
