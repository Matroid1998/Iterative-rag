Description:
A clinically-approved drug that forms an irreversible covalent bond to C797 in T790M-containing EGFR, used in the treatment of T790M-positive NSCLC tumors.

Text:
Activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) kinase domain, most prevalently L858R and exon19del, are common causes of 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and often serve as predictive markers for the 
selection of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as effective targeted therapies.12 
Prolonged efficacy of firstgeneration TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) is eventually made 
limited due to drug resistance as a result of patients acquiring a second T790M 
gatekeeper mutation.3 To produce a viable treatment option for T790Mpositive NSCLC 

tumors, drug development efforts have yielded the clinicallyapproved drug AZD9291 
(osimertinib), which is selective for T790Mcontaining EGFR and made potent by forming 
an irreversible covalent bond to C797.45 Despite promising indications, drug resistance 
to osimertinib is inevitable and caused in part by the acquisition of a third kinase domain 
mutation C797S that prevents formation of the potencyenabling covalent bond.

Description:
A third-generation EGFR inhibitor used as a frontline therapy for EGFR L858R and exon19del mutant tumors.

Text:
More 
recently, osimertinib has been shown effective, and clinicallyapproved, as a frontline 
therapy in untreated patients harboring EGFR L858R and exon19del activating 
mutations.6 

Figure 1. Chemical Structures of thirdgeneration EGFR inhibitors osimertinib and 
lazertinib. As osimertinib is the only approved thirdgeneration EGFR TKI for L858R and 
exon19del EGFR mutant tumors, development efforts from Yuhan and Janssen biotech 
sought to produce a drug with improved medicinal chemistry properties. These efforts 
resulted in YH25448 (lazertinib), which is structurally related to osimertinib comprising an 
aminopyrimidine core and acrylamide warhead but is distinct with respect to the 
substituted pyrazole as well as morpholine groups (Figure 1).7 Preclinical headtohead
