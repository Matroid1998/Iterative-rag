Description:
A group with unique physiochemical properties including high lipophilicity with a Hansch parameter value of 1.44.

Text:
Fluorinated molecules play pivotal roles in several chemical areas ranging from life science to materials.1 In this context, the increased 
interest in accessing functionalized molecules bearing a fluorine atom favoured the development of very efficient methodologies for the 
incorporation of fluorinated motifs.2 Among these fluorinated motifs, the SCF3 group has attracted considerable attention over the past 
decade.3 This group possesses unique physiochemical properties including high lipophilicity with a Hansch parameter value of 1.44.4 
Thus, such a moiety facilitates transmembrane permeation of the molecules improving their bioavailability.

Description:
A motif of high interest in organofluorine chemistry.

Text:
In this regard, several new 
reagents including commercially available ones have been reported.5 Given the high interest in SCF3 motif in organofluorine chemistry, 
the synthesis of easily accessible new reagents is highly desirable.6 
We have recently reported the robust and efficient onepot synthesis of unprecedented N(SCF3)(CF3) compounds from 
commercially available starting materials.7 Upon evaluating their stability, it turned out that compound I (Scheme 1) demonstrated 
excellent stability in water, organic solvents, and under different physiological conditions. However, this compound quickly degraded 
under basic conditions, raising the question of its ability to be a source of fluorinated motif. Thus, we disclose herein that PhPhN
(SCF3)(CF3) can be used to forge CSCF3 bond under mild visible light irradiation conditions by using an organophotocatalyst.8
