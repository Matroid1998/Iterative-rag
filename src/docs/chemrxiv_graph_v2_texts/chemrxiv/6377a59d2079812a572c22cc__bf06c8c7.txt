Description:
Undergoes an enzymatic process catalyzed by LinB dehalogenase.

Text:
showed that the carbonhalogen cleavage is the rls in the case of DhaA 
reaction with 1,2,3trichloropropane (instead of product release as observed previously for the 
DhaA  1,3dibromopropane complex).3 Moreover, studies conducted using LinB in the 
reaction with 1,2dibromoethane,4 8chloromethyl4,4difluoro3,5dimethyl4bora3a,4a
diazasindacene (BDP), and 4(bromomethyl)6,7dimethoxycoumarin (COU),5,6 further 
underlined that the enzymatic process catalyzed by the same dehalogenase can be limited by 
different steps depending on the degraded substrate. These results, combined with those from
