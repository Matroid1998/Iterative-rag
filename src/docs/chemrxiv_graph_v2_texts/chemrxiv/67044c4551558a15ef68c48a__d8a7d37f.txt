Description:
Reactive species in biosynthesis with enhanced reactivity for promoting condensation reactions.

Text:
Thioesters are ubiquitous and wellstudied reactive species in biosynthesis. For example, 
the active sites of polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases leverage 
enhanced thioester reactivity to promote challenging condensation reactions that form new CN, 
CO and CC bonds. The markedly higher reaction rates of thioesters compared to oxoesters 
with various nucleophiles has been rationalized by electron delocalization effects.13 By contrast, 
all extant ribosomes employ oxoesters to support bond forming reactions, despite the 
observation that thioesters are generally more reactive towards amine nucleophiles.1,2 During 
translation, thioesters could in principle substitute for oxoesters if tRNA substrates carried an SH 
in place of OH on the 3terminal ribose.

Description:
More reactive towards amine nucleophiles than oxo esters.

However, substituting a sulfur for an oxygen atom in an 
acyltRNA could impact translation positively or negatively at multiple steps during, before, or after 
the translation cycle. Although thioesters are more reactive towards amine nucleophiles than oxo
esters,1,4 CS bonds are longer than CO bonds, and Satoms more polarizable than Oatoms; 
thiols and thioethers donate and accept Hbonds differently than alcohols,57 making the overall 
effect of sulfur substitution on ribosomal protein synthesis challenging to predict.

Description:
May have played a key role in the origin of life by generating oligomeric peptides with potential catalytic activity.

Text:
Steps in 
translation that could be affected by these differences include tRNA maturation, in which the tRNA 
3terminal CCA nucleotides are added, tRNA aminoacylation, tRNA delivery to the ribosome 
during mRNA decoding, and finally peptide bond formation in the ribosomal active site, the 
peptidyl transferase center (PTC).8 
Many have theorized that thioesters may have played a key role in the origin of life,912 
wherein aminoacyl thioesters1315 could have generated oligomeric peptides with potential 
catalytic activity10, thereby acting as a link between the prebiotic and RNA world.16,17 Prebiotically 
plausible synthetic routes to nucleosides with 2thiolmodified ribose have been identified and 
routes to 3thiolmodifications proposed, further strengthening the possibility that short 
sequences of modified RNAs could have acted as early amino acid transfer reagents as the first 
RNA protoribosomes evolved.9,13,15 Thus, despite modern peptidyl transfer in the ribosome using 
exclusively oxoesterlinked aminoacyltRNA, it is possible that thioesters rather than oxoesters 
acted as early intermediates in ribosomal peptide synthesis.18,19
