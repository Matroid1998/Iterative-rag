This material is also used as a food supplement because it contains the richest natural 
source of carbohydrates, basic fibers, proteins, and lipids in amounts ranging from 13 to 55, 
0.3 to 20, 10 to 40, 1 to 10, respectively. The minerals and trace elements, vitamins and 
carotenoids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, sterols, and terpenes are other minor 
components. Flavonoids and phenolic acids have been suggested to be responsible for the 
biological activities of these compounds 9. Indeed, some nutritionists claim that only 
consuming bee pollen will allow human beings to live properly 7. Many analytical techniques such as spectroscopy (UV  Vis, FTIR, NMR, and MS) and 
chromatography (TLC, HPLC, and GC) have been applied in the development of methods for
