Organic ligands used in monolayer-protected metal nanoclusters.

Text:
Monolayerprotected metal nanoclusters (MPCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic
approach for a wide variety of biomedical applications, including targeted drug delivery,
bioimaging, and sensing. These ultrasmall atomically precise nanoclusters contain a metal
core and a protecting monolayer of organic ligands such as thiols, alkynyls, phosphines, and
carbenes.1 An important aspect of the biomedical applications of MPCs is their good biocom
patibility and solubility. Although bare gold atoms are biologically inactive, several studies
have reported their toxic effects including inflammation, immune response, and damage to
cell membranes.2 MPCs can interact with biomolecules through several noncovalent interac
tions depending on their shape, size, composition, surface functionalities, and morphology. A
deeper insight into the interactions between MPCs and cell membranes is essential to extend
ing their applications in diverse fields.
