Description:
An element with relative abundance, low cost, and favorable geographic distribution.

Energy storage devices with improved volumetric and gravimetric energy densities 
beyond Liion batteries are essential to mitigate the effects of climate change 1. One promising candidate is the lithiumsulfur (LiS) chemistry due to its high 
theoretical capacity (1,675 mAh g1) as well as the relative abundance, low cost and 
favourable geographic distribution of sulfur 2,3 compared to materials used in Li
ion positive electrodes. However, while advances in this technology have been 
made, widespread commercialisation has been hampered by a range of challenges. The insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S necessitates a greater proportion of 
conductive additives than is required for Liion batteries. These typically comprise 
around 30 wt of the positive electrode composite, which in turn reduces the 
energy density of the cell 4,5.

Description:
A key active material in LiS cells, often resulting in low utilization and poor electrochemical performance.

Text:
Significant research has been undertaken to increase 
the active material loading of LiS cells 6, however this often results in poor 
electrochemical performance due to low sulfur utilisation and an increase in the 
polysulfide shuttle effect 7. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance can be 
improved by the addition of an excessive mass of conductive carbon to the positive 
electrode composite and substrate 8,9. In some instances, as little as 20 wt sulfur 
is incorporated into the positive electrode, resulting in a gravimetric capacity too 
low for practical applications 10. Additionally, most LiS cell research is conducted using coin cells which use a Li 
metal foil as the negative electrode.
