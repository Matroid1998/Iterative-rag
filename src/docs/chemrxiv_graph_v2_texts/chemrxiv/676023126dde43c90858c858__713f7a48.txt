Description:
Used in chiral complexes for metal-catalyzed asymmetric reductive amination.

Text:
Recent years have witnessed impressive advances in transition 
metalcatalysed, organocatalytic, and biocatalytic asymmetric re
ductive amination.49 Metalcatalysed approaches typically use chi
ral iridium(I), rhodium(I), or ruthenium(II) complexes at elevated 
hydrogen pressure (10 bar) and have demonstrated broad ketone 
and amine scope. Organocatalytic methods predominantly rely on 
axially chiral phosphoric acids as catalysts, Hantzsch esters, silanes 
or boranes as reducing agents, and aniline derivatives as amine sub
strates.
