Description:
Studied for water dissociation energies on its surface planes.

To advance our understanding of corrosion mechanisms at the atomic level and to develop 
corrosion mitigation strategies, computational approaches, particularly density functional 
theory (DFT), have become valuable tools.3,710 DFT enables researchers to probe atomic
scale interactions, providing insight into the energetics, adsorption behaviour, reaction 
mechanisms, and electronic properties of materials in corrosive environments.1116 
In the last two decades, numerous DFT studies have been conducted to investigate iron 
oxidation processes at the atomic scale. Since water and oxygen are the main corrosive agents, 
most studies have focused on how these agents interact with the crystallographic surface planes 
of iron. For example, Eder et al. investigated the water dissociation energies on Fe(100) and
