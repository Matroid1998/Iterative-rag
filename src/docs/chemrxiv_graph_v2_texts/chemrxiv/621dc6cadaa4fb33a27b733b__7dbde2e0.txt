Description:
Safe and inexpensive solvent used in the synthesis of COCl2.

However, in 
recent years triphosgene itself has been reported to be highly toxic,6 and an alternative method is 
urgently needed. The ondemand synthesis of COCl2 through the UVlight irradiation of chloroform 
(CHCl3) was recently reported,7 which is a simple method that incorporates safe and inexpensive 
CHCl3 as the solvent and COCl2 precursor. This method requires highenergy UV light, which induces 
the decomposition of COCl2 as the product as well as the versatility of the substrate. However, although 
reactions with nucleophiles such as alcohols proceed efficiently, they are not suitable for the synthesis 
of carbamoyl chlorides from lightunstable amines.

Description:
A compound with a CH bond dissociation energy of 95.7 kcal mol⁻¹.

On the other hand, we reported the CH oxygenation reaction of methane (CH4) through the light 
activation of chlorine dioxide radical (ClO2).8 In these oxidation reactions, the chlorine radical (Cl) 
generated from the ClO2 gas upon light activation cleaved the CH bond. The CH bond dissociation 
energy of CH4 is 104 kcal mol1, which was higher than that of CHCl3 (95.7 kcal mol1).9 These results 
prompted us to investigate the generation of COCl2 through the oxygenation of CHCl3 with ClO2
