Description:
An inhibitor of ER-Golgi-dependent protein secretion.

The molecular machinery and mechanism driving unconventional secretion of FGF2
The first pieces of evidence suggesting the existence of ERGolgiindependent pathways of protein
secretion from mammalian cells date back to the late 1980s (Muesch et al. 1990). Along with, for
example, Interleukin 1 and members of the galectin family, FGF2 was recognized as one of the first
candidates of proteins transported into the extracellular space in a signal peptideindependent manner,
suggesting alternative pathways of protein secretion that bypass the classical ERGolgi route (Pallotta and
Nickel 2020). This was experimentally verified by transport of FGF2 into the extracellular space and
shown to be insensitive to brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ERGolgidependent protein secretion (Florkiewicz
et al. 1995; Trudel et al. 2000; Engling et al. 2002).
