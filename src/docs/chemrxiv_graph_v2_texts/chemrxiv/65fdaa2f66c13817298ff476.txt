Description:
Molecules whose electronic excited states can couple with quantized photonic modes inside an optical cavity to influence photochemical isomerization reactions.

For
example, collective couplings between the elec
tronic excited states of fulgide or similar molecules
and quantized photonic modes inside an optical
cavity were shown to both enhance or suppress
photochemical isomerization reactions.2,3 In an
other example, vibrational excitations collectively
coupled to the photonic excitations of a microcav
ity, commonly referred to as vibrational strong cou
pling (VSC), resulted in chemical kinetics that can
be enhanced4,5 or suppressed.68 In these two col
lective coupling regimes, the kinetics of the reac
tions are changed, but importantly there is no new
type of product generated compared to the same
reactions outside the cavity.
