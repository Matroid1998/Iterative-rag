Description:
A conventional superconductor used in proximity coupling with semiconductor nanowires.

Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) are an active area of research into potentially nonAbelian
quantum states which some authors suggested could offer a degree of protection for de
coherence in specially designed quantum computing architectures.13 MZMs manifest as
zeroenergy midgap states localized at boundaries and topological defects within one and
twodimensional topological superconductors.4 One heavily researched platform for realiz
ing MZMs involves proximity coupling a conventional superconductor, most commonly Al
and Nbbased alloys, with a semiconductor nanowire with strong spinorbit coupling (SOC),
such as InAs or InSb.
