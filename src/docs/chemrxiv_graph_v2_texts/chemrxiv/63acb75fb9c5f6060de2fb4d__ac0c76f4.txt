Description:
Part of a solid solution series with tuneable elastic moduli.

Text:
The mechanical properties of molecular perovskites have been demonstrated to be tuneable 
through different components of the material.15 For instance, the larger elastic moduli and 
hardness of C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 compared to (CH2)3NH2Mn(HCOO)3 have been attributed to 
the larger number of hydrogen bonding interactions,16 and a similar conclusion can be drawn for 
the elastic moduli across the Asite solid solution series NH3NH21xNH3OHZn(HCOO)3.17 Looking 
at the impact of the metal ion, a linear correlation between the elastic moduli and ligand field 
stabilisation energy has been observed for the series (CH3)2NH2M(HCOO)3 with M2  Mn2, 
Co2, Ni2 and Zn2.18 Likewise, the bulk modulus of several molecular perovskites series, such as 
(CH3)2NH2M(HCOO)3 (M2  Mn2, Fe2 and Cu2) 19, (C3H7)4NM(C2N3)3 (M2  Mn2 and Cd2),20, 
21 (NH2)3CM(HCOO)3 (M2  Mn2, Co2 and Cd2)22, 23 have been explored by highpressure 
diffraction experiments on single crystals and powders.
