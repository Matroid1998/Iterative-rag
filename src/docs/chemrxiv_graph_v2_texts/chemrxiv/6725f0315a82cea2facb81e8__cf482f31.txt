Description:
The dominant anion with mz 1375 in the negative ion spectrum.

Text:
In the case of hydrolytic MAO from W. 
R. Grace (10 or 30 wt) a remarkably simple negative ion
spectrum is obtained using metallocene10 or other Lewis base 
donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS).11 The dominant 
anion present has mz 1375 and a likely composition based on 
MSMS 
studies 
is 
(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me 
(hereinafter 
abbreviated 16,6).
