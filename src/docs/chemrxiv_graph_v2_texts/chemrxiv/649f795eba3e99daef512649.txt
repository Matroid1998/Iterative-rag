Exhibits increased solubility in nickel with rising temperature, contributing to nanostructure growth.

of ethanol vapor. Using real time imaging, we 
revealed the active state of the Ni catalyst during the temperaturedependent CNFSCNTS growth 
(600800 ). We observed the formation of CNFs starting from 600 C and CNTs were formed 
at higher temperatures. The lattice parameter measurements pointed to an expansion of the Ni 
lattice as the temperature was increased, which we attribute to increased carbon solubility. The as
grown CNFs and CNTs were further characterized by XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and EELS, that 
allowed to have a highly reliable overall view of the structure changes with temperature. Results 
revealed that the change in structure with temperature was caused by the combined effects of 
increased carbon solubility and graphitization of the walls of the growing nanostructure.

Has increased solubility affecting diffusion and structural changes at high temperatures.

This 
increased carbon solubility in turn affected carbon diffusion and could be the reason for the change

from tipgrowth to basegrowth in a CNT at 800 .
