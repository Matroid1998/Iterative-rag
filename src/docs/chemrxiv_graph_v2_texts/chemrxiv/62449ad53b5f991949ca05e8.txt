Description:
The oxidized analogue of sp2 hybridized graphene, well-suited for metal ion adsorption.

Text:
Graphene oxide (GO), the oxidized analogue of sp2hybridized graphene, is a promising, 
emerging separations material that is wellsuited for metal ion adsorption.1 GO flakes are typically 
synthesized through chemical exfoliation of graphite.2 In general, GO flakes have both hydrophilic 
edges and hydrophobic basal planes,3 meaning they are dispersible in water, durable,4, 5 and surface 
active.6, 7 The final chemical and physical properties of the flakes strongly depend on the synthetic 
route8, 9 with minor changes affecting average flake size7, 10, 11 and polydispersity,4 as well as the 
number density, placement, and type of oxygenbased functional groups.7, 12 Consequently, 
adsorption studies using GObased separation membranes have demonstrated a range of sorption 
capabilities, likely linked to small changes in GO preparation and final structure.8 Despite the 
widespread applicability of GO, there is limited fundamental molecular adsorption information.
