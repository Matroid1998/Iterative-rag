Description:
A compound whose radiohalogen labeling at the A ring does not diminish cytotoxicity against U266 cells.

Text:
of the 
radiohalogen labeling unit at the A ring of EGCG did not diminish their cytotoxicity against U266 
cells compared to EGCG. Finally, we successfully synthesized a 18Flabeled EGCG via 18F
fluorination of the precursors followed by acidic deprotection.
