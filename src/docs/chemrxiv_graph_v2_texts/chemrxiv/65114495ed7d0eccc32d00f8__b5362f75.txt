Description:
A long-chain PFAA restricted due to its persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and adverse effects on humans and the environment.

Text:
Nowadays, the number of known PFAS 
45 
ranges from thousands to millions, depending on the definition and source of information. 46 
According to the updated OECD definition, all chemicals containing a CF3 or isolated CF2
47 
group are considered PFAS, which has increased the number of PFAS considerably 9,10. 48 
Global regulatory efforts restricted the production of selected longerchain PFAAs such as 
49 
e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) due to their 
50 
persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and adverse effects on humans and the environment 
51 
11. This resulted in the production of replacement compounds of rather similar persistence, 
52 
increasing the number of different PFAS on the global market that are also eventually emitted 
53 
into the environment 12.
