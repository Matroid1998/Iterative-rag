Description:
A functional group that can drastically modify the electronic structure of Tp.

Text:
A recent development in the chemistry of pyrazolylborates 
by Besson and coworkers, made it possible to selectively functionalize the pyrazole backbone 
of Tp ligands with strongly electrondonating or withdrawing groups (Figure 1).13, 14 This is 
promising as most lanthanidetrispyrazolylborate complexes use either the nonfunctionalized 
Tp or feature simple shortchain alkyl groups (e.g. methyl or isopropyl), that do not

substantially change the electronic properties of Tp.11 The introduction of functional groups, 
like the nitrogroup (NO2), that can drastically modify the electronic structure of Tp, thus 
provides the opportunity to design new Tp ligands to manipulate the properties of resultant 
LnTp complexes.
