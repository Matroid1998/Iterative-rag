Artificial photosynthesis has emerged as an 
important strategy to utilize sustainable energy in 
the form of solar energy as a clean energy source. 1
7 The end products of artificial photosynthesis6 are 
known as solar fuels8 (hydrogen,911 hydrogen 
peroxide,11, 12 methanol,2 HCOOH,13 methane,14 
ammonia15 etc.) which can be produced in a 
cleaner way through water splitting,16, 17 CO2 
reduction18, 
19 and N2 reduction.20 Although 
hydrogen is considered as possible alternative to 
carbonbased fuels,6 recently H2O2 has emerged as 
suitable alternative to both carbon fuel and 
hydrogen.7, 21 H2O2 is a liquid chemical and thus 
easy to transport and utilize compared to hydrogen 
which requires energyintensive process for its 
transport and storage.

Description:
Produced through photocatalysis and involved in water oxidation.

Text:
This 
development highlights the progress in producing 
hydrogen 
peroxide 
through 
photocatalysis.28 
However, some of those systems show relatively 
low catalytic activity toward water oxidation for 
H2O2 production. Also, decomposition of produced 
H2O2 by photogenerated electronsholes and UV 
light is also a concern in certain cases. In order to 
achieve largescale hydrogen peroxide production, 
it is crucial to build catalysts that can effectively 
oxidise water to hydrogen peroxide while 
maintaining high stability and durability. Hence, 
developing inexpensive photocatalytic systems 
that can generate H2O2 through water oxidation is 
very critical for realizing practical implementation 
particularly for bulk scale application.
