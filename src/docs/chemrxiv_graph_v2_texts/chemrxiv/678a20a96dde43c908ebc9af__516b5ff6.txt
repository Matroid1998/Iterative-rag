Description:
Its industrial synthesis contributes to CO2 production.

For more than a century, the natural supply of sodium
nitrate (NaNO3) has been predominantly extracted from
the mines of South American countries, particularly
Chile. Beyond the geopolitical conflicts it has incited, its
diverse applications, from thermal storage systems 13
to fertilizer production 4, smoke bombs 5, and food
preservatives 68, highlight the need for efficient recov
ery processes for this key material 9, 10. The urgency
of developing such processes is further amplified by the
fact that the industrial synthesis of NaNO3 contributes
to CO2 production 11. In addition, studies have shown a connection between
increased levels of nitrate ion (NO
3 ) and an increased
risk of mortality from diseases such as Alzheimers, dia
betes, stomach cancer, and Parkinsons 1215.
