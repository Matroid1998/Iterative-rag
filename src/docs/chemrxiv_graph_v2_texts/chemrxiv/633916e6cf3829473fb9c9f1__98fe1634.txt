Description:
Has a higher oxidation potential and a higher electrochemical stability window compared to PEO.

Text:
In addition, Lee et al.18 used density functional theory to show that PFPE has a higher oxidation potential 
and a higher electrochemical stability window compared to PEO, which was also observed experimentally 
in small molecule perfluoroether electrolytes.2325 However, little is known about the lithium ion solvation 
structure, mobility, and transport mechanism in solid PFPE electrolytes. There are two classes of polymer electrolytes with different ion transport mechanisms single
ionpolyelectrolyte and saltinpolymer (see Figure 1a).
