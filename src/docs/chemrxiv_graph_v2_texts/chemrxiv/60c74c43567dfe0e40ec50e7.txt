3 In SCO materials the enthalpy dier
ence between the HS and LS states, H  HHS HLS, is typically less than 50 kJ mol1.4
As SCO often occurs in large coordination complexes and coordination polymers, this is
challenging for rst principles approaches to accurately and reliably capture. Density functional theories (DFT) utilizing hybrid functionals, which include some exact
exchange can predict H accurately enough to allow the prediction of many material prop
erties. Notably, Jensen and Cirera 5 reported that the metahybrid TPSSh, with 10  exact
exchange, gave a mean absolute error relative to experiment (MAE) of 11 kJ mol1 for H
for a range of Fe based SCO complexes.
