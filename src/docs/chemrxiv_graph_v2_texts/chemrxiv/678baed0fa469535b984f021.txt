Description:
Undergo defluorinative functionalization using single-electron transfer methodologies.

Text:
Despite the robustness of carbonfluorine bonds, recent 
advances have enabled their selective cleavage under carefully 
designed conditions.4 
Trifluoromethyl carbonyl compounds have emerged as versa
tile substrates for such transformations. Notably, singleelec
tron transfer (SET)based methodologies employing photore
dox catalysis or mild reductants have been applied to achieve 
defluorinative functionalization of esters and amides (Figure 
1A).5 However, these methods are unsuitable for trifluorome
thyl ketones due to competing reduction of the carbonyl group, 
leading to undesired byproducts.
