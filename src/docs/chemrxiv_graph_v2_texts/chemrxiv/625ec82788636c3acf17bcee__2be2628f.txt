Description:
A metal that binds C and O strongly.

Text:
In
general, for any adsorbate A, the chemisorption energy
EA is defined as,
EA  EAEEA
where Arepresents A adsorbed on the surface, is the
free surface and A is the adsorbate in vacuum. Figure 1a
shows the chemisorption energies of O plotted against
that of C. It is evident that there is a significant amount
of scatter and no linear scaling relations are observed. Despite the lack of linear scaling, there is, broadly, an
increasing trend for both C and O energies in Figure
1a. Metals that bind C strongly (for example, Fe) also
bind O strongly and those that bind C weakly (Au,
Ag) also bind O weakly. However, due to the noticeable
amount of scatter, this general rule does not always
hold.
