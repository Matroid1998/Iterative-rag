Derivatives are produced through multistep reactions in organic solvent.

Other viologen derivatives have shown 
potential in AORFB application,1013 yet further improvements in viologen structural designs 
are needed to reach higher volumetric capacities while remaining chemically stable and 
membrane compatible. Conventionally, viologen derivatives are produced through multistep reactions in organic 
solvent.9,11,14,15 Although this results in simple purification as the charged product precipitates 
out of organic solution, so does the partially reacted, charged monosubstituted byproduct. Since chloroterminating 4position functionalization reagents have limited substitution 
activity within organic solvent temperature ranges (80 oC), bromoterminating reagents with 
heightened leaving group capability are often used to improve yield.11,14 However, these 
reagents are more expensive with still limited yields below 50,14 and ionexchange processes
