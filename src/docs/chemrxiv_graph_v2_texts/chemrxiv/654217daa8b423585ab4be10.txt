Description:
A substitution in therapeutic oligonucleotides that imparts resistance to nucleases and improves RNA binding affinity.

Text:
2methoxy, 2methoxyethoxy (MOE), and 2
fluoro are all commonly deployed substitutions in thera
peutic oligonucleotides (Figure 1B) which impart both re
sistance to nucleases and improvements in RNA binding 
affinity.
