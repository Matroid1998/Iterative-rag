Description:
An essential nutrient whose limitation can lead to increased oil production by oleaginous yeasts.

Text:
Despite the demonstrated potential of vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable 
oleochemicals and oilbased biofuels, the low yield of oil per hectare of land by conventional 
oilseed crops is limiting our ability to scale production.1,2 Fermentationderived oil may provide 
an avenue to improve yields to meet expected demands for oilbased biofuels and oleochemicals 
in a growing circular bioeconomy.3 While highyielding sugar crops such as sugarcane and sweet 
sorghum are traditionally fermented to ethanol, they can also be fermented by oleaginous yeast 
to produce microbial oil (i.e., singlecell oil), mainly in the form of triacylglycerides (TAG) 
which are suitable for biodiesel production.4,5 Oleaginous yeasts naturally produce large amounts 
of oils from simple sugars when an essential nutrient such as nitrogen, phosphorous, or sulfur is 
limiting.
