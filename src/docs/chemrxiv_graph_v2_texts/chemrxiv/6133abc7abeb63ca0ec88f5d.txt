Description:
Can cause hypersensitivity, vacuolization, and accumulation in the body.

Text:
Despite PEG being generally 
regarded safe, antibodies against PEG 4447 and some other limitations such as toxic side 
products 48, 49, hypersensitivity 50, 51, vacuolization 5254 and accumulation in the body 
40, 54, 55 were reported. Several studies reported on already preexisting antibodies in 
several patients 56, 57 during clinical trials with PEGylated therapeutic agents. Hamad et al. demonstrate that depending on PEG concentration and molar mass, unexpected anaphylaxis 
in some sensitive individual animals could occur 58 after administration with medicines 
containing a high concentration of PEGylated carriers. Zhang 59 and later Zhao et al. 60 
reported on the toxic influence of PEGmodified particles. Accordingly, the search for 
alternatives has been a going research topic in the chemistry community.
