Description:
Molecules that can be detected and distinguished by Raman spectroscopy through isomeric structures.

Text:
First, Raman spectroscopy not only provide fingerprint information of molecules 
31 
but also can distinguish isomeric structures, allowing for isomeric glycan detection17. 32 
Second, the availability of lowcost Raman spectrometers will enable widespread 
33 
adoption18. Additionally, a lowcost plasmonic SERS substrate (0.08 per test), called 
34 
nanopaper, are used to enhance Raman signals19, 20. 35 
In our previous work, we had evaluated two commercially available BA receptors, namely 
36 
4mercaptophenylboronic acid (4MBA) and 1thianthrenylboronic acid (1TBA), which 
37 
effectively captured glycan molecules through cisdiol chemical reactions15. Utilizing 
38 
advanced ML algorithms, we analyzed spectral variations across a wide frequency range 
39 
for glycan detection. This sensor successfully distinguished stereoisomers and structural 
40 
isomers featuring different glycosidic linkages. 41
