Description:
A nature-derived, recyclable, and biodegradable polymeric material.

Thermoplastic polymers constitute approximately 75 percent of
the plastics market1 and are widely utilized for their excellent
strengthtoweight ratio, high processability, corrosion resistance,
and affordability. The properties of these polymers can be further
enhanced by incorporating additives such as fibers or nanoparti
cles. Alternatively, thermoplastic polymers can act as a support
ing matrix for various functionbearing particles. Most thermo
plastics are currently derived from nonrenewable fossil resources
and are largely nonbiodegradable.2 However, the development
of naturederived, recyclable, and biodegradable polymeric mate
rials, such as polylactide (PLA) and bionylon56 (PA56), is gain
ing traction, finding sustainable applications in industries like au
tomotive and electronics.3,4
The development of novel thermoplastic polymers and their
composites typically requires extensive testing, involving com
pounding and subsequent specimen characterization.
