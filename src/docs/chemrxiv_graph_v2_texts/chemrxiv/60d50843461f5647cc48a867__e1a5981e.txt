Description:
A sterically encumbering PN ligand used to prevent oligomerization.

Text:
Excluding a small number 
of Ru and OsPN complexes,1316 very few mononuclear 
late transition metalPN complexes have been reported 
(Fig 1B), often requiring the presence of stericallyde
manding coligands to prevent oligomerization.1720 This 
situation can be partially explained by significant dp re
pulsive effects which are expected to impede the ability of 
PN ligands to serve as 3 or 5electron donors. This gen
eral tendency of late transition metalPN complexes to 
form oligomers  even with the usage of stericallyencum
bering PN ligands such as tBu3PN  challenges syn
thetic efforts in this area.10, 21
