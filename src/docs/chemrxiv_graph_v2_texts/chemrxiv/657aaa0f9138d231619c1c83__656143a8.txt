Description:
A conserved residue in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR L858R mutant targeted by ynamide-based kinase probes.

Text:
Our 
group recently developed a 3phenyl2Hazirine and a coupling 
reagent, ynamide, as tool probes for the selective profiling of 
carboxylic acid residues in live cells12,13, and found that the 
ynamidebased kinase probes can covalently target a conserved 
glutamic acid in the ATP binding pocket of EGFR L858R mutant.13 
In this study, we further developed a new approach for exploration 
of covalently targetable lysine residues of kinases from live cells, 
and applied this method in natural products for profiling conserved 
lysine residues. These might be useful information for the 
development of new types of targeted covalent inhibitors. Covalent chemistry integrated with chemical proteomics has 
been a powerful approach to the investigation of small molecule
protein interactions under in situ conditions14.
