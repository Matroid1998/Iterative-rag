Description:
Has well-characterized experimental studies of CO preferentially adsorbing on an atomic site.

Text:
In a study of the FeMgO magnetic tunnel junction (a 
system with some similarities to the present work), it gave an excellent description of the transmission 
probability.9 For benchmarking adsorption of CO on TM surfaces, we take structures of the adsorbed 
molecule using DFT, and perform QSGW calculations on them. We compare to photoemission data for CO 
on Cu (111)1012 and Pt (111)13, 14. Pt (111) as they remain the best characterized experimental studies of CO 
preferentially adsorbing on an atomic site, whereas Cu (111) is an experimentally relevant catalyst for
