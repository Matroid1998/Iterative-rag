Text:
Bismuth iodides and oxyiodides have been subjects of many recent studies exploring 
applications such as radiation detection, digital imaging, photovoltaics and catalysis. They have 
been synthesized as polycrystalline powders, large single crystals or thin films. Among the 
early reports of synthesis of BiI3 are studies from Singh et al 1 and Chaudhuri et al 2 who 
iodinated solution grown Bi2S3. Wang et al 3 synthesized BiI3 by a hydrothermal protocol 
and explored their use for roomtemperature Xray detection. Studies have also been carried 
out on bismuth iodide synthesized using physical vapor deposition (typically involving a 
modified vertical Bridgman method) for Xray detection and digital imaging 47. Similar 
studies have also been carried out for radiation detection using BiI3 8, 9.
