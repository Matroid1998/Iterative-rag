Description:
Responsible for around 1% of global emissions in the Haber-Bosch process.

Ammonia is a vital chemical that is primarily used to produce fertilizer for agriculture, but 
also has uses in the chemical industry as a commodity chemical.1,2 Globally, more than 
180 million metric tons of ammonia are produced annually by the HaberBosch process3 
which is responsible for around 1  of global carbon dioxide emission and requires large, 
centralized facilities to be operated continuously. Developing an alternative process to 
produce ammonia with less environmental impact and in localizable devices would 
enable onsite and ondemand production that can be coupled to the evergrowing 
renewable 
energy 
sector. Alkalimetal 
mediated 
electrochemical 
processes, 
predominantly the lithium mediated system has proven to be the best candidate for 
activating dinitrogen (N2) since its revival in 2019.4 Initially developed by Tsuneto et al.
