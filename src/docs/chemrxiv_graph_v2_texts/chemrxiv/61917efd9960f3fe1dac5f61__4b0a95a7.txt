Description:
Acts as a pore blocker for Kir channels.

Inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels are expressed in tissues throughout the body where 
they play central roles in many physiological processes, such as parasympathetic slowing of the 
heart1, pain perception2, and pancreatic insulin secretion.39 Some mutations in these channels 
result in improper trafficking that is associated with Andersen syndrome.10 In particular, 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a minor component of the cytoplasmic 
leaflet,11 is required for activation of all Kir channels.1215 Kir channels are also regulated by many 
other molecules including phosphorylation by kinases, sodium, pore blockers (polyamine, Mg2), 
and ethanol.10, 16, 17 There are seven subfamilies of Kir channels classical Kir channels (Kir2.x) are 
strong rectifiers that have central roles in cardiac inward rectifier current; Kir3.x channels are 
unique in that they require G in addition to PIP2 for function with some of these channels 
modulated by sodium ions; ATPsensitive potassium channels (Kir6.x); and transport potassium 
channels (Kir1.x, Kir4.x, Kir5.x, and Kir7.x).9, 10, 1821 

All Kir channels form tetrameric complexes composed of similar or different subunits.15, 22, 23 Each 
subunit encodes two transmembrane domains (TMD), in which the K selectivity filter resides, 
that is tethered by a short linker to the cytoplasmic domain (CTD).22, 23 Structures have also 
revealed a PI(4,5)P2 binding pocket located at the interface of the TMD and CTD.15, 23 The binding 
pocket is a highly conserved region consisting of a set positively charged amino acid residues that 
engage the phosphorylated headgroup of PI(4,5)P2.15, 23, 24 Mutations in residues important for 
binding the signaling lipid are associated with Bartter and Andersen syndromes, and other 
diseases.5, 25, 26 The specific lipid binding site within Kir channels has garnered the attention of 
computational studies to identify and predict lipidbinding sites on ion channels.2730
