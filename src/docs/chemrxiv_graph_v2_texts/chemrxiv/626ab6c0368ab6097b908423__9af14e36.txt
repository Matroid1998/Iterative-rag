Description:
Complexes with high thermodynamic and kinetic stability, comparable to other metaldioxygen species in enzymes.

Text:
The CoIII(O2) complexes have a high thermody
namic stability and a kinetic stability while they are elec
tronically comparable to other metaldioxygen species pre
sent in enzymes.6,7 Moreover, they are readily prepared at 
ambient conditions via the reaction between a cobalt(II) 
salt and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).8 
In this report, we propose tripodal CoIII(O2) complexes 
as models to investigate the effect of the hydrogen bonding 
on the metaldioxygen binding and on the oxygenoxygen 
bond activation (Figure 1c.) To this end, we employed the 
ligands developed by Masuda et al. and used advanced mass 
spectrometric techniques, such as infrared photodissocia
tion spectroscopy and gasphase dissociation studies, to ob
tain a direct structurereactivity correlation.
