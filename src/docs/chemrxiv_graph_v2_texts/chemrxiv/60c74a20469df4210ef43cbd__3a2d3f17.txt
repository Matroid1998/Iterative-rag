Materials and methods
Dissolving pyrocathecol violet (PCV, 250 M) and nickel sulfate (250 M) in 24(2hydroxyethyl)1piperazinylethanesulfo
acid (HEPES, 100 mM, pH7.4) formed Ni(PCV), which is blue colored at working micromolar concentra
tions (Figure 1). By analogy with other reported dinuclear complexe 10 8 , we hypothesized that the
Ni(PCV) complex could be used to assemble a receptor for phosphate derivatives, exploiting metalligand
interactions for selective target recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this mononuclear complex has
