Description:
Has larger elastic moduli and hardness due to a larger number of hydrogen bonding interactions.

Text:
The mechanical properties of molecular perovskites have been demonstrated to be tuneable 
through different components of the material.15 For instance, the larger elastic moduli and 
hardness of C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 compared to (CH2)3NH2Mn(HCOO)3 have been attributed to 
the larger number of hydrogen bonding interactions,16 and a similar conclusion can be drawn for 
the elastic moduli across the Asite solid solution series NH3NH21xNH3OHZn(HCOO)3.17 Looking 
at the impact of the metal ion, a linear correlation between the elastic moduli and ligand field 
stabilisation energy has been observed for the series (CH3)2NH2M(HCOO)3 with M2  Mn2, 
Co2, Ni2 and Zn2.18 Likewise, the bulk modulus of several molecular perovskites series, such as 
(CH3)2NH2M(HCOO)3 (M2  Mn2, Fe2 and Cu2) 19, (C3H7)4NM(C2N3)3 (M2  Mn2 and Cd2),20, 
21 (NH2)3CM(HCOO)3 (M2  Mn2, Co2 and Cd2)22, 23 have been explored by highpressure 
diffraction experiments on single crystals and powders.

Description:
A compound used to study the impact of B-site metal defects on bulk modulus.

Text:
Some studies24, 25 have reported trends 
such as a relationship between size and chemistry of the divalent Bsite metal and the bulk 
modulus, which agree with chemical intuition. Furthermore, the impact of Bsite metal defects 
has been studied by comparing C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 with its defective analogue 
C(NH2)3Fe2313(HCOO)3, (  vacancy), which exhibits a bulk modulus that is nearly 30 
lower.26 This body of work demonstrates the immense potential for tailoring the mechanical 
properties in hybrid and molecular perovskites, depending on a solid understanding of the 
chemical and physical principles that affect them.
