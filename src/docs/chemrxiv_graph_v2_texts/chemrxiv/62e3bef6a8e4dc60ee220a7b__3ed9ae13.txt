Description:
Involved in the synthesis of surfactants through esterification.

Text:
This allows the application of enzymatic catalysis in new seg
ments and industrial processes, emphasizing on the synthesis of surfactants through the esterification of 
sugars. Literature records of Candida artactica lipase B point it out as a potential catalyst, leading to high 
activity in direct esterification various polyalcohols with fatty acids 2. The esters produced have poten
tial use as emulsifiers in the food and cosmetic industries. In addition, likely antitumor and antimicrobial 
actions are reported for this material, enabling its use in drug formulations. Traditionally, these com
pounds are produced by hightemperature reactions with toxic reagents and acid catalysts, what is not a 
clean methodology 3. Enzymatic catalysis applied in organic synthesis takes place under milder conditions of tem
perature and pressure 4.
