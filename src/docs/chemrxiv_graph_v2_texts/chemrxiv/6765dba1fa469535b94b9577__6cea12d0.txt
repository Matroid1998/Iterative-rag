Description:
Due to its high abundance and lower cost compared to Li, it is considered for Na-ion based batteries.

Text:
Today, innovation in battery technologies is urged by widely recognized concerns regarding
the sustainability of stateoftheart Liion batteries (LIB). Currently, LIBs power most consumer
electronics in the market and the move towards hybridelectrically powered transportation is posing
even higher demands for LIBs production. This has caused a sharp raise on the cost of Li raw
materials and has brought a concern on an accelerated depletion of Li natural sources 1, 2, 3. Due
to the high abundance of Na on the earth crust and a much lower cost as compared to Li, Naion
based batteries (SIBs) are deemed to be a suitable candidate to replace LIBs 1, 2, 3. However,
some intrinsic properties of Na bring some performance limitations to SIBs.

Description:
Has a theoretical capacity of 1,165 mAh g1 as an anode.

Text:
Due to a larger atomic
weight of Na, the theoretical capacity of a Na anode is smaller (1,165 mAh g1) than that of a Li
anode (3,829 mAh g1) 3. The standard reduction potential of Na (2.7 V vs. SHE) is higher
(easier to reduce) than that of Li (3.07 V vs. SHE), which implies a slightly narrower (300 mV)
working voltage window, and thus an inferior energy density 3. Moreover, the larger size of the
Naions (1.06 A cation radius) as compared to Li (0.76 A cation radius) requires suitable crystal
structures that are able to intercalate the larger Naions in a reversible manner 2, 3.

Description:
Ions accommodated in between transition metal layers in NaxMO2 compounds, occupying octahedral or trigonal prismatic sites.

Text:
Nevertheless,
SIBs are seen as an excellent alternative costeffective and sustainable technology for applications
where weight is not important such as stationary storage, key for the development of electrical
grids 1. Due to their analogy with their Liion counterparts, layered NaxMO2 compounds, where M
is a transition metal, are amongst the most studied cathode materials for Naion batteries 1, 4. NaxMO2 compounds have a layered crystal structure where Naions are accommodated in between
n transition metal layers MO2 per unit cell where each Naion can occupy octahedral(O) sites, On
type compounds, or trigonal prismatic sites (P), Pntype compounds 5. The crystal structure of
these compounds has a great influence on Naion transport and stability during battery operation
