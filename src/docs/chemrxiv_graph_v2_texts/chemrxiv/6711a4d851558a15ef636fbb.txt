Description:
Used as a metal impregnated in polysiloxane polymer for catalytic reactions.

Text:
Cronin and coworker used 3D printing to fabricate 
reactionware for use in flow chemistry.2 Similarly, Lennox printed polytetrafluoroethylene 
vessels for use in electrochemical fluorination while others have printed custom 
electrochemical and photochemical reactors.3 More recent work has sought to develop printed 
materials capable of catalytic reactions, for example a polysiloxane polymer impregnated with 
Pd metal and another printed material with single site catalytic centers.2a,4 We hypothesized 
that one of the most common 3D printing materials, copoly(acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene) 
(ABS), could produce an excellent solid acidcatalyst for synthetic conversions. With the 
capabilities of 3D printing to allow the precise design of reaction spaces, we sought to print a 
solid support suitable for use as a solid phase catalyst in flow chemistry. We report the results 
of these studies in this manuscript.
