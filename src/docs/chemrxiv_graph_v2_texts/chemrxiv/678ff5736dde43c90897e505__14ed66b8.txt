Description:
Groups that delocalize to stabilize protonated porphyrin nitrogens.

Text:
Protonation of these three sites 
results in a structure for which numerous resonance forms may be written, including the classic Types A, 
B, and C, as well as a novel form that we have called Type D, in which all four of the meso substituents 
are involved in resonance. In the Type D form, two aminophenyl groups delocalize as usual to stabilize 
the protonated porphyrin nitrogens while the third aminophenyl group delocalizes with the pyridinium 
substituent through the porphyrin core (Scheme 1).
