The 
dearth of fluorination enzymatic functions is in stark contrast to the ubiquity of organofluorine 
compounds in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, as the incorporation of fluorine 
into organic compounds can often lead to improved bioavailability, enhanced metabolic stability, 
and desirable protein binding affinity1417. In light of the broad utility of organofluorine compounds, 
particularly those possessing a fluorinated stereogenic centre18, fluorine biocatalysis19 and fluorine 
synthetic biology2023 have long captivated synthetic chemists and synthetic biologists. Among the 
various fluorination methods24,25, biocatalytic enantioselective C(sp3)H fluorination would be 
particularly valuable10, as only a handful of chemocatalytic asymmetric C(sp3)H fluorination 
methods are available to nonenolate systems26,27, further highlighting the challenge in imposing 
stereocontrol over fluorination processes. Among these, highly enantioselective C(sp3)H 
fluorination using a free radical mechanism26 is particularly challenging.
