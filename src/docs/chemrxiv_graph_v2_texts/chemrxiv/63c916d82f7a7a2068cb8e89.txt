Description:
Involved in catalytic hydrogenation reactions, adding to substrate molecules in an atom economic and cost-effective manner.

Text:
Catalytic hydrogenation reactions are ubiquitous in the industrial synthesis of both bulk and fine 
chemicals.13 The addition of H2 to a substrate molecule is atom economic and generally cost
effective, making such reactions very attractive from an environmental point of view.26 This 
prospect has motivated a continuous effort towards understanding the activation of H2 by 
transition metal catalysts. Classically, reduced transition metal centers activate the HH bond via 
two bonding interactions (Figure 1, a) sdonation by the H2 ligand to a metal vacant site and 
backdonation from the metal delectrons to the s(HH) orbital.

Description:
Activation with 3d metals is more challenging due to weaker MH bond formation.

Text:
Strong orbital interactions result 
in oxidative addition, fully cleaving the HH bond to form a metal dihydride (Figure 1, b).3,4,68 In 
contrast, weaker interactions result in nonclassical dihydrogen complexes, in which some extent 
of HH bonding is preserved.810 
Activation of molecular H2 with 3d metals is generally more challenging than with 4d or 5d metals 
because they tend to form weaker MH bonds.

Description:
A molecule involved in hydrogenation reactions where its HH bond is cleaved by bifunctional catalysts.

Text:
Nevertheless, the use of 3d metals for 
hydrogenation reactions has attracted considerable interest in view of their abundance, low cost, 
and generally lower toxicity.11 Bifunctional catalysts that rely on ligands actively participating in 
the cleavage of the HH bond1114 play a central role in this transition (Figure 1, c).1113,1519 In 
particular, Lewis bases incorporated in the ligand can accept a proton from the H2 molecule to 
generate a hydride.11,13,2023 A related, very successful strategy relies on reversible
