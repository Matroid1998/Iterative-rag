Bisphenols represent a prominent class of chemical compounds used in production of 
polymeric materials with excellent thermal, mechanical, and optical properties.6 Bisphenol A 
(BPA) is the most widelyused member of this class of compounds, and is currently produced 
on multimillion ton scale per year.7 BPA is used in manufacturing of materials for consumer 
products, such as packaging in food industry and epoxy resins in construction and furniture 
industries.8 It has been known for a long time that BPA can activate estrogen receptors (ER), 
mimicking the biological activity of endogenous estrogens, such as 17estradiol (E2),9 and a 
number of studies have linked BPA to adverse effects on both human health and the 
environment.7,10 The use of BPA in food contact materials (FCM) is therefore highly regulated, 
with a complete ban for use in nursing bottles since 2011 in the EU.
