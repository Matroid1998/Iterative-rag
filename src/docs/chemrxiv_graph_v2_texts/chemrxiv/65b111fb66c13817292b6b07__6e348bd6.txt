Description:
A stable terrestrial compound observed in the interstellar medium.

Since the detection of the first interstellar molecules,2,3,4 the question arose as to how small molecules 
evolve into complex organic molecules and prebiotic systems.5 Many theories and concepts have been 
formulated to explain and understand how chemical diversity and complexity increased through the 
reaction of small molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM).6,7,8 To date, more than 300 molecules 
ranging from small to large (carbon chains, fullerenes) molecules as well as radicals and ions have been 
observed in the ISM.9 Some of these molecules, like CO, CO2 or NH3, are stable terrestrial compounds, 
while others are highly reactive and transient species.
