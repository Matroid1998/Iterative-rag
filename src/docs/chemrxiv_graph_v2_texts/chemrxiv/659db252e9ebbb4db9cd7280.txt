reactions.15,18,19,2328 Many of these studies18,19,2325,28 combine the ML models with semi
empirical or lowerlevel QMMM methods to obtain the energy predictions that match the
accuracy of higherlevel QMMM methods. For example, GomezFlores et al.19 used a ML
approach to predict the energy difference between the density functional tightbinding model
and other higher level QM methods for a thioldisulfide exchange reaction in water. In a
study by Pan et al.,18 a ML model was trained to reproduce ab initio QMMM poten
tials in free energy simulations for the aqueous Menshutkin reaction between ammonia and
chloromethane.
