Description:
Films that are ferroelectric and piezoelectric.

Besides, 
chemical techniques were the first to achieve thicker HfO2 films (1 m) that are 
ferroelectric and piezoelectric.10 Regardless of the fabrication technique, in most 
reports dealing with HfO2 the typical bottom electrodes have been Pt and TiN. These 
materials must be deposited by sputtering or evaporation. Moreover, the most 
prevalent substrate has been monocrystalline Si(100). The results with such 
substrate and seed layers have been excellent and high Pr values have been 
achieved. However, substrates and electrodes themselves carry on high costs of the 
raw materials and processing. Furthermore, they might limit the imagination of what 
could be possible to achieve for ferroelectric devices. Conductive oxides have been used as replacement for metallic electrodes in some 
applications.
