Description:
A radical that adds to a vinyl crosslinking agent to propagate polymer growth.

Text:
The Ragogna group has developed a method to synthesize 
robust phosphorus polymer networks from the bulk phase using a thermal or photoinitiator that 
show excellent surface adhesion, barrier properties to O2, optical transparency in the visible 
spectrum, and thermal stability up to 400 C.79 Phosphaneene polymer networks propagate by 
the formation of a phosphinyl radical, which adds to a vinyl crosslinking agent to propagate the 
polymer growth.7,1012
