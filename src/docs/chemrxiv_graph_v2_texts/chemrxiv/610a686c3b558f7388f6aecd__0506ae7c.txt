Description:
Anions used in bottom-up chemical synthesis with divalent metallic cations.

However, for largescale applications they suffer from an important lack of scalability. From a different point of view, we find 
methods in solution, like bottomup chemical synthesis from thiohypophosphate (P2S6)4 anions and divalent metallic cations M2,12 
and the topdown liquidphase exfoliation (LPE) approach. These strategies provide much higher versatility and processability, 
making them perfect candidates for developing 2Dcrystalbased functional inks.13,14 Regarding LPE approach, it is a 
straightforward method but with a low degree of control over the quality of the layers. Even so, very few works have tried to 
exfoliate MPX3 through sonicationassisted exfoliation.
