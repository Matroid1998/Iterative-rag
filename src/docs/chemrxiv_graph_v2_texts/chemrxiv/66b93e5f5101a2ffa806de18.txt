Description:
Involved in microstructure growth at the electrodes.

Text:
In particular, operando cells and methods have been developed to 
probe gas reactions1315, interfacial phenomena1618, and structural and redox processes within the bulk of 
the electrodes9,12,19, sometimes concurrently. Among these techniques, electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR) and magnetometry stand out as noninvasive tools that allow one to follow charge storage 
processes2025, and degradation mechanisms including transition metal dissolution26,27 and Li microstructure 
growth at the electrodes2,28,29, and radical generation in the electrolyte30,31. EPR is a magnetic resonance technique that probes unpaired electron spin transitions in paramagnetic, 
radicalcontaining, or metallic substances using low energy microwave radiation. When placed in a 
magnetic field, electron spin microstates split via the Zeeman effect. The resonance condition is given by 
 !, where  is the gfactor,  is the applied magnetic field, and ! the Bohr magneton.
