Description:
Neutral compounds isolated in low-oxidation state aluminium chemistry.

Text:
In the past ten years considerable progress has been made in lowoxidation state main group 
chemistry.13 In particular, lowoxidation state aluminium chemistry has flourished,47 from the isolation 
of the neutral dialumenes810 to exploiting Al(I) species in the activation of strong bonds via oxidative 
addition, such as those commonly found within waste emissions (e.g., CO, CF).11, 12 Furthermore, in 
2018, the longstanding assumption that aluminium is always electrophilic was ended by an elegant 
method that exposed its latent nucleophilic character.13 Whilst these discoveries deepen our fundamental
