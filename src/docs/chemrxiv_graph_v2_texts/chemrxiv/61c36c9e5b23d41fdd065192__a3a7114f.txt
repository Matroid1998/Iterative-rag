Description:
Formed by the oxidation of nbutanol and can be overoxidized to the corresponding acid.

Text:
We showed that Gluconobactor oxidans (G. oxidans) 
effectively oxidized nbutanol to nbutyraldehyde. A subsequent aldol condensation catalyzed 
by a biocompatible lysine catalyst delivered 2ethyl2hexenal (2EH) in 84 yield and 1.6 g 
L1 titers in aqueous buffer at 28C.22 We not only delivered a commercially valuable precursor 
in onepot under mild conditions from a renewable substrate, but also demonstrated that 
organocatalysts can be leveraged to redirect metabolic flux within the system. At extended 
processing times G. oxidans overoxidize the aldehyde to the corresponding acid. However, 
the inclusion of an organocatalyst with the whole cell biocatalysts intercepts the aldehyde and 
drives flux to the industrially relevant ,unsaturated aldehyde.
