Description:
A vinyl polymer synthesized via free radical polymerization, used in composites and drug delivery devices.

Text:
Free radical polymerization (FRP) is a leading industrial route for synthesizing vinyl polymers 
such as low density polyethylene, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), with 
applications ranging from commodity (e.g. household tools and packaging items) to advanced 
products (e.g. composites and drug delivery devices).1, 2 Such vinyl polymers are although 
composed of CC bonds that are not realistically degraded under disposal conditions.3 For their 
recycling, we can thus not rely on an intrinsic recyclability but need to reach out to mechanical 
or chemical recycling technology, the former challenged by inferior macroscopic properties 
upon repetitive recycling and the latter facing a high energy cost.46
