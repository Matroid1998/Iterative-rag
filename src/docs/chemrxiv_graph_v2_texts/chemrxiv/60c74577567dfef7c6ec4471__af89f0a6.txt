Description:
Transforms from a metastable fcc domain to a stable hexagonal close packed wurtzite phase.

Text:
The
metastable fcc AlN domains further transform into a stable hexagonal close packed AlN wurtzite
phase with a pronounced volume increase of 24.28 These structural transformations cause a
sharp decrease in hardness of Ti1xAlxN22 as well as generation of microcracks which serve as
