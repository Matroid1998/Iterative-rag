Description:
A radical that adds to a vinyl group in radical thiolene photopolymerization.

Text:
Digital light processing (DLP) of photopolymerizable inks and hydrogels typically uses 
(meth)acrylated formulations crosslinked via the chaingrowth process of photoinitiated radical 
polymerization (Figure 1A). A limitation of radical polymerization for DLP printing is its oxygen 
sensitivity.1, 2 To counteract oxygen inhibition, higher photoinitiator concentrations and higher 
light doses are typically applied, which can lead to phototoxicity in bioprinting contexts.1 
Photopolymerizable precursors based on radical thiolene photopolymerization are interesting 
alternatives to radical (meth)acrylate polymers. The radical thiolene reaction involves the addition 
of a thiyl radical to a vinyl group to form a thioether (Figure 1B).
