Description:
Attractive phosphors with high photoluminescence quantum yields.

This is because of myriad reasons, including their 
excellent color purity, low power consumpTon, and thinner displays.1 Currently, commercialized OLEDs 
employ 3rd row transiTon metal complexes as emiUers for the red and green subpixel on account of 
their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to achieve up to 100 internal quantum 
eciency (IQE).2 In parTcular, cyclometalated Iridium(III) complexes are parTcularly aUracTve 
phosphors as many have high photoluminescence quantum yields (FPL).3 
Historically, Iridium complexes of the type Ir(CN)3 or Ir(CN)2(LL) (where CN represents a 
cyclometalaTng ligand like 2phenylpyridinato and LL represents an anionic bidentate ancillary ligand 
like acetyl acetonate, acac) such as Ir(ppy)2(acac) have been employed as emiUers in OLEDs.4 The 
photophysical properTes of these complexes can be easily tuned through ligand modicaTon.5, 6 One 
approach that has been popular in recent years is the introducTon of indolo3,2,1jkcarbazole (iCz) 
moieTes in place of the phenyl unit of ppytype ligands.
