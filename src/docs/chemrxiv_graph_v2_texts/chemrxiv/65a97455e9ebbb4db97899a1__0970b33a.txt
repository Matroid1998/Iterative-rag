Description:
React with dicopper carbene complexes to form mononuclear carbene and alkene complexes.

Text:
For example, the group of Warren 
reported two dicopper carbene complexes in which each copper 
center is supported by a diketiminate ligand (Figure 1).13,14 They 
show that these complexes can transfer their carbene ligand to 
alkenes, phosphines and dioxygen. However, these complexes exist 
in equilibrium with their mononuclear carbene counterparts in 
solution, and it is proposed that the mononuclear carbene 
complexes are responsible for the observed carbene transfer 
reactivity. Similarly, the group of Hoffman reported a dicopper 
carbene complex supported by two iminophosphanamide ligands 
(Figure 1).15 This complex was found to react with alkenes to form 
the corresponding mononuclear carbene and alkene complexes, 
but no carbene transfer reactivity was reported.

Description:
No carbene transfer to alkenes was found using a dinickel complex.

Text:
In a collaborative study, the groups of Tilley 
and Scheer reported how the dinucleating naphthyridine based 
DPFN ligand can stabilize such a welldefined dicopper complex 
featuring a bridging Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) (Figure 1).17 
Although the reactivity of this complex is not described, one would 
not expect carbene transfer chemistry given the NHCs stabilized 
nature.18 A welldefined dinuclear complex bearing a less stabilized 
carbene was reported by the group of Uyeda, albeit with a different 
transition metal (Figure 1).19 Although no carbene transfer to 
alkenes was found using this dinickel complex, it did display 
stoichiometric and catalytic transfer reactivity to isocyanides.
