Description:
An antibiotic analog with potent antibacterial activity.

Text:
In the past decade, a large number of targetspecific, biarylcontaining peptide macrocycles have 
attracted the attention of researchers for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.1 As a 
result of their target selectivity and strong binding affinity, biaryl cyclic peptides represent promising 
scaffolds in the development of novel bioactive compounds.24 Especially noteworthy are the 
antibiotics vancomycin and the arylomycin analog G0775, each possessing potent antibacterial 
activity (Figure 1A).2 Heterobiaryl peptides have also garnered attention in recent years. The 
heterobiarylcontaining peptide macrocycle complestatin (also known as chloropeptin II) possesses 
activity against HIV.

Description:
Has a synthetic heterobiaryl analog.

Text:
Heterobiaryl linkages can be found in aciculitin AC, TMC95A as well as a 
synthetic heterobiaryl analog of arylomycin (Figure 1B).4,5 More recently, a novel PCSK9 inhibitor 
produced by Merck contains a peptide bridge involving a heterobiaryl linkage between a triazole 
and aryl rings. Synthetically, heterobiaryl and biaryl linkages in peptide macrocycles are typically 
constructed from buildingblocks and then incorporated into the peptide backbone via a 
conventional amidation reaction.
