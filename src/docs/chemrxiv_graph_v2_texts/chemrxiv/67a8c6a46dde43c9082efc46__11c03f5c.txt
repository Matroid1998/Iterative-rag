Within
this diverse category, carbonbased materials such as activated
carbon fibres, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, graphene,
graphite, and graphene oxide have shown remarkable potential
due to their tunable structure and surface reactivity8. Water (H2O) adsorption on twodimensional (2D) materials,
such as graphene and fullerenebased sheets, plays a crucial
role in applications ranging from sensing to photocatalysis912. Pristine graphene and related 2D materials exhibit weak water
adsorption due to its nonpolar nature. In contrast, structural
modifications like doping with heteroatoms (e.g., B, N, or P)
significantly enhance its hydrophilicity and adsorption capac
ity1316. Similarly, fullerenebased 2D networks demonstrate
improved water interaction upon doping, altering surface charge
distribution and electronic properties1719.
