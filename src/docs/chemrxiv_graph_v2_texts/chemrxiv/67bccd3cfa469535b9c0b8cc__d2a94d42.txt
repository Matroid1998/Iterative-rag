Description:
Display outstanding encapsulation and transfection efficiency due to a balanced combination of hydrophobicity and functional groups with protonation capacity.

Among the nonviral gene delivery vectors, poly(aminoester)s (pBAEs), a promising class of 
cationic polymers, oer low cytotoxicity, high transfection capacity, and biodegradable prole, 
the attributes desirable for an ideal vector 3,4. pBAEs display outstanding encapsulation and 
transfection eciency, which is provided by a balanced combination of hydrophobicity and 
functional groups with protonation capacity. Electrostatic interactions with oligonucleotides, in 
addition to a netuned hydrophobicity, enables pBAEs to oer enhanced encapsulation ability 
5. The protonation of tertiary amines by the lower pH of endosomal compartment builds up 
osmotic pressure that eventually leads to endosomal escape. Moreover, pBAEs can be 
functionalized at terminal acrylates with cationic oligopeptides such as arginine (R), lysine (K), 
and histidine (H) via a thiaMichael addition reaction to form oligopeptide endmodied pBAEs 
(OMpBAEs).
