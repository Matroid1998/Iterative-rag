Description:
Formed from the reduction of an epoxide in several cell lines.

While ATXII did not show estrogenic effects in Ishikawa cells (Dellafiora et al., 2018), chemical 
76 
degradation of the compound was suggested in the presence of the anthocyanin delphinidin 
77 
(Aichinger et al., 2018). In several cell lines (Caco2, HCT 116, HepG2 and V79), it has been reported 
78 
that the epoxide of ATXII was reduced to an alcohol resulting in ATXI, which seemed not to be further 
79 
metabolized in Caco2 cells (Fleck et al., 2014a; Fleck et al., 2014b). 80 
In this study, we investigated the fate of ATXII in intact and homogenized tomato fruits during food 
81 
processing steps at a laboratory scale.
