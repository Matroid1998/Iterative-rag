Description:
A gaseous fuel produced via the reduction of water in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).

Text:
Electrochemical water splitting is a potentially carbonneutral method of splitting 
water into gaseous H2 fuel and O2 via electrical energy from renewable sources. H2O is 
oxidized to O2 in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) at the anode and reduced to H2 in 
the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at the cathode. Electrochemical H2 production is 
generally performed entirely in alkaline media but HER is much more favorable in acidic 
media.
