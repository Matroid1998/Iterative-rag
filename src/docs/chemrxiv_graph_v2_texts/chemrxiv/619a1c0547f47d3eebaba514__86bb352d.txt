Produced from water and renewable electrical energy via electrolysis.

The PowertoX process is a promising technology to tackle the challenge of the storage of surplus 
fluctuating renewable electricity by converting it into chemical energy. During the PowertoGas (PtG) 
process, H2 is produced from water and renewable electrical energy via electrolysis and subsequently 
converted with the carbon oxides CO or CO2 into CH4 (synthetic natural gas) by the Sabatier reactions 
(Gtz et al., 2016; Rnsch et al., 2016; Kalz et al., 2017). In short and midterm, the most promising 
carbon oxide sources are industrial exhaust gases, such as blastfurnace and converter gas from steel 
industry, gases from cement production or biomass gasification, which potentially consist of COCO2 
(COx) mixtures of variable composition over time (Sutton et al., 2001; Sch et al., 2014; UribeSoto et 
al., 2017).
