Description:
A biobased solvent used for extracting fish oil, derived from orange and lemon peels.

A few bioeconomy companies have lately started 
production of valued bioproducts from fisheries by
products, especially of fish oil and fish proteins for the 
petfood industry.6 The shift from fish and krill to fish 
processing waste is particularly urgent in the case of fish 
oil production.7 Rich in omega3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, indeed, the extraction of fish oil for the production of 
omega3 food supplements contributes to overfishing 
across the world.8 
Amid the new, low energy circular economy processes to 
recover valued bioproducts, the extraction of a whole fish 
oil named AnchoisOil (AnO) from Mediterranean 
anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fillet leftovers using the 
biobased solvent dlimonene was first reported in 2019.9 
Limonene indeed is an excellent solvent for lipids, but 
contrary to many oilderived solvents it provides several 
health benefits being edible and widely used in the 
nutraceutical industry.10 
The process is entirely circular and wastefree because 
after the extraction of the oil, the biobased solvent derived 
from orange and lemon peels prior to fruit squeeze and 
juice production is nearly entirely recovered, whereas the 
anchovy residue (AnR) is an exceptional organic fertilizer 
dubbed AnchoisFert (AnF).11 
Named LimoFish (LiF),12 and conducted under ultra
mild conditions (ambient temperature and pressure), the 
new extraction process has significant practical relevance 
because it closes the fishing material cycle for the worlds 
most fished species (anchovy)8,9 using a solvent that 
prevents microbial spoilage due to its powerful 
antimicrobial activity.10
