Description:
A reactive metal used in anodes for solid-state batteries, with complex morphological evolution during cycling.

Solidstate batteries (SSBs) hold promise as an improved energy storage technology, since 
they potentially offer higher energy densities, improved safety, and enhanced stability compared 
to lithiumion batteries.16 Solidstate electrolytes (SSEs) could enable the use of lithium metal 
anodes; however, lithium anode implementation in SSBs has been hindered by the reactive nature 
of lithium and its complex evolution during cycling.710 Anodefree battery architectures, in which 
lithium is deposited in situ on a current collector during the first charge, are of particular interest, 
as they eliminate the need for excess lithium metal during manufacturing and also enable high 
energy density.1116 However, the morphological evolution of lithium is even more challenging to 
control in anodefree SSBs than in lithiumexcess SSBs.1721 This is because nucleation and growth 
must occur on a foreign current collector, and the lack of excess lithium requires extremely high 
Coulombic efficiency (CE) for longterm cycling.15
