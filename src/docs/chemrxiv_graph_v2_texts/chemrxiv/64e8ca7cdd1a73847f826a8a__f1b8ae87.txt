designed and isolated under normal experimental conditions the crystalline actinide 
cluster Th(8C8H8)(3Cl)23K(THF)22 containing at its heart the trithorium ring with a 
pair of uniformly distributed electrons.3 This discovery has been hailed for extending the range 
of the aromaticity concept to the record seventh row of the periodic table, and it has been suggested 
that aromaticity can be an important factor in the design of stable complexes with actinideactinide 
bonds (which have previously been reported to be very weak and localized).4 The followup 
investigations revealed that the experimental data and the results of calculations of the magnetic 
criteria of aromaticity5 do not provide solid proves for the existence of the aromatic trithorium 
bond,6,7 and the unique multicenter chargeshift bonding (ThCl2)3 was shown to be the actual 
factor determining high symmetry (D3h) and exceptional stability of the crystalline actinide 
cluster.7 Very recently, Lin and Mo provided further computational data supporting the charge
shift bonding in the actinide cluster, and found that the overall charge transfer between thorium 
and chlorine atoms is about ten times more stabilizing than electron delocalization in the Th3 
ring.8 The authors linked the latter with the stabilization effect resulting from the periodic 
boundary conditions (PBC) for the electron distribution,9 and made the conclusion that the tri
thorium bonding is therefore truly delocalized and aromatic.8 Similar conclusions were 
drawn by Tomeek et al.10 who utilized the entire arsenal of sophisticated computational 
methods to demonstrate that the Th3 ring contains cyclically delocalized electrons and should be 
regarded aromatic.
