Description:
Compounds with high compositional abundance and variability, used in thermoelectrics, high-temperature coatings, magnetocalorics, or electronic components.

Text:
Within the family, the systems with triels and tetrels are the most explored and within this 
group, silicides show perhaps the highest compositional abundance and variability.8, 9 For instance, 
known isothermal sections of the RNiSi systems are represented by at least 20 compounds (Ce10, 
Gd,11, 12 Dy.13), while already 31 compounds have been reported in the LaNiSi system,14 although 
no systematic explorations have usually been performed and more efforts are still required to uncover 
the full picture. Despite intensive but unsystematic structural screening, much less attention has been 
paid to the physical properties. However, some of them have already found their applications as 
thermoelectrics,15 hightemperature coatings,16 magnetocalorics,17, 18 or electronic components1921.
