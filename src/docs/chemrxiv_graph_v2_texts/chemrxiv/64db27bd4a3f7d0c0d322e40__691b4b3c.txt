Description:
A diazo compound where R1 and R2 indicate functional groups.

Text:
Diazo compounds (i.e., (R1)(R2)CN2 where R1 and R2
indicate functional groups) are wellknown carbene (i.e.,
(R1)(R2)C) precursors that have garnered significant at
tention in organic synthesis because of their unique elec
tronic and structural properties 110. The generated
carbenes from diazo are highly reactive intermediates
that participate in a variety of chemical processes, includ
ing XH insertion (where X  C, O, N, S) 1118, cyclo
propanation 1924, and tandem crosscoupling 2528. The N2 gas is released to the atmosphere from diazo to
carbene transformation (Scheme 1). Thus, if the activa
tion energy barrier for breaking the carbonnitrogen bond
in a diazo compound is crossed, the reaction becomes ir
reversible. In other words, regardless of whether the reac
tion is thermodynamically exothermic or endothermic, it
is governed by kinetics.
