Description:
Removed from alkanes in the desaturation process to form alkenes.

Text:
Alkenes are important reaction intermediates in organic synthesis and used as monomers in 
polymerizations. A straightforward route to their synthesis is the desaturation of alkanes by 
removal of dihydrogen. The thermodynamically and kinetically challenging process has been 
realized with various metal catalysts,1 including Ir, Ru, Os, and Rh, and stoichiometric amounts 
of an oxidant or hydrogen acceptor at elevated temperatures of 200oC or higher.2 
Stoichiometric methods for desaturation rely on insitu generated radicals as intramolecular 
hydrogen acceptor.3 Pincertype metal complexes and a hydrogen acceptor have been used for 

the desaturation of cyclic ethers,4 aliphatic ketones,5 amines, or Nheterocycles4a,6 at 
temperatures exceeding 100 oC (Fig. 1a). Jones et al.
