Description:
Forms hypothetical high-pressure phases with CsCl structure.

Text:
As for the hypothetical highpressure phases with Sn and CsCl 
structure, they were found to be less energetically favorable than the rocksalt phase of BAs 8. Phase diagrams of the BSb 16 and BBi 17 systems at ambient pressure have a similar topology, 
characterized by the absence of binary compounds and the presence of noninvariant reactions of 
decomposition of the liquid phase into rhombohedral boron and a vapor phase. Therefore, zinc
blende BSb and BBi, which have been claimed to be the groundstate phases 37, are hypothetical. The same is true for their highpressure transitions to corresponding rocksalt phases.
