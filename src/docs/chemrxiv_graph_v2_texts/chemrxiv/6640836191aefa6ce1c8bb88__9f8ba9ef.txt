Description:
Interacts with supported Ru catalysts in hydrogenation reactions.

Text:
demonstrated that the activity of this catalyst could be enhanced significantly by a strongly 
reductive treatment in the reaction gas mixture 9. The authors explained this by the formation 
of Lewis basic sites on the support, which could stabilize more active flat Ru nanoparticles 
(NPs), resulting in strong metalsupport interactions (MSIs). While the performance and activity of supported Ru catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation 
reactions 1016 and on mechanistic aspects of these reactions 8, 1722 were investigated 
in numerous studies, the interaction of CO2 with these catalysts under different reaction 
conditions has received much less attention so far, in spite of its crucial importance for these 
reactions.

Description:
Leads to the deposition of Oact species on the Ru surface.

Text:
A subsequent O2 multipulse sequence 
led to the formation of CO2, which was assigned to an O2induced decomposition of surface 
carbonate species. Similar experiments performed with CO2 or CO2containing gas mixtures 
such as COCO2 or H2CO2 revealed that also these gases lead to the deposition of Oact species 
on the Ru surface, with the amount the amount of Oact deposition (after 1000 pulses) increasing 
in the order COCO2  CO2  H2CO2  O2. To further test the interaction between CO2 and the 
catalyst surface, we also performed preliminary isotope labelling experiments, sending marked 
C18O2 pulses over the reduced catalyst surface. These measurements revealed significant 
formation of C16O18O and C16O2 species, indicative of oxygen exchange between C18O2 and 
the catalyst surface. Details about mechanistic aspects etc. remained, however, unresolved.
