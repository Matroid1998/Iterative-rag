Description:
Derivatives used as lipophilic salts to reduce resistivity and maintain electroneutrality in ion-selective membranes.

Screening of ionophores is usually performed through the fabrication and testing of potentiometric 
membranes, which is a time and laborintensive task that consumes high amounts of the recognition 
molecule. The ionophore is the most important, but not the only component of the ionselective 
membrane. Lipophilic salt reduces the resistivity and maintains the electroneutrality during the sensing 
process2,3. The most commonly used lipophilic salts are derivatives of quaternary boron (e.g. potassium tetrakis3,5bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylborate, KTFPB) or ammonium salts (e.g. tridodecylmethylammonium chloride, TDMAC)4. All the membrane components are suspended in a 
plasticized polymer. Plasticizer lowers the polymers glass transition temperature and significantly 
affects its conductivity and diffusion rate57. It can also enhance interactions with other membrane 
constituents and analytes, thus improving the overall selectivity of the fabricated sensor.
