Description:
Uniquely effective at facilitating the highly efficient double oxidative dearomatization of electron-deficient phenols.

Text:
Bidentate nitrogenligated iodine(V) compounds, Bi(N)HVIs, were first reported by Zhdankin 
and coworkers in 2002.4 Recently, we demonstrated that these compounds, and specifically 
Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI, were uniquely effective at facilitating the highly efficient double 
oxidative dearomatization of electrondeficient phenols, such as pnitrophenol (Table 1, entries 
1 and 2).5 In this report, the reactivity of Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI was benchmarked against a 
range of other iodine(V) reagents. Specifically, IBX provided very low yields of the target 
quinone and precursor PhI(O)(OAc)2 gave no reaction at all (entries 3 and 4). The stronger 
oxidant PhI(O)(OTf)2 afforded the product quinone in 59 yield after 20 minutes, which 
decreased to 27 yield after 4 hours due to continued oxidative degradation (entries 5 and 6).

Description:
A compound that provides higher yields compared to bi(4omeetbipy)hvi.

Interestingly, Bi(4OMeEtbipy)HVI provided the product in much lower yields in comparison 
to Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI (entry 7). This revealed that electronic effects within the bipyridine 
ligand might play a crucial role in the efficiency of the oxidation. It was also interesting to note 
that the reaction employing pyridineligated PhI(O)(Py)2(OTf)2 only returned unreacted
