Description:
Used as an analogue in studying TPP-dependent enzymes.

Text:
For example in pyruvate dehydrogenase 
complex E1subunit (PDH E1) an acetyl group is transferred from a donor (pyruvate) to an acceptor 
(lipoamide) through a pingpong mechanism via intermediates 24 (Figure 1a).1 Using thiamineTPP 
analogues as smallmolecule inhibitors has been a wellestablished approach to studying andor 
manipulating cellular pathways involving TPPdependent enzymes.220 The structures of three such 
inhibitors 57 are shown in Figure 1b.2,14,15 They all possess a neutral central ring to capture the strong 
stabilising interactions between the enzyme and the catalytically active highenergy TPP ylide 1.7 
However the need to make the central ring often lengthens the synthesis considerably.
