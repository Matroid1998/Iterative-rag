Description:
A clinker phase formed by melting raw minerals at high temperatures.

Text:
Most of the emissions, up to 60,
26
are intrinsic to the material.2 The raw minerals, mainly clays and limestone, are melted at
27
high temperatures to form the clinker phases calcium silicate and aluminate phases, which
28
mixed with other components such as gypsum and additives, form the cement. During
29
melting, the calcination of limestone (CaCO3) releases a considerable amount of CO2, which
30
is unavoidable.3 Therefore, the strategies for cements environmental impact reduction are
31
based on Carbon Capture and Utilization or a reduction of the clinker in cement through
32
the use of Supplementary Cementitious Materials.
