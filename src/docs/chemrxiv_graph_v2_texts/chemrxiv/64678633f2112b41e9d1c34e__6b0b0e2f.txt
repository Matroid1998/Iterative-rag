Description:
A material with semicrystalline atomic structure known for excellent electrical conductivity, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, and thermal stability.

Glassy carbon (GC), also known as vitreous carbon, was originally synthesized in the 1930s 1. However, it was not until the 1950s that the morphology of this material began to be characterized at the 
nanoscale 1. GC differs from amorphous or graphitic carbon due to its semicrystalline atomic structure. The atomic structure gives this material unique properties such as excellent electrical conductivity, 
biocompatibility, chemical inertness, thermal stability, low mass density, and relatively high Youngs 
modulus 1, 2. Because of these properties, GC is extensively used in ablatives, carboncarbon composites 
(CC composites), electrodes, bone implants, and synthetic zeolites, to name a few applications 1, 37. CC composites are particularly relevant to the development of the next generation of hypersonic vehicles 
that require lightweight and thermally resistant structural components.
