Can be converted to corresponding aryl trifluoromethanes through multistep sequences in low yields.

of the CF3 group occurs using a robust and selective 1,2addition reaction 
that tolerates many useful functional groups. As a complementary strategy, deoxytrifluoromethylationaromatization represents 
potentially powerful opportunity to access highly substituted ArCF3 compounds, 
addressing the limitations of previously mentioned methods. Such a strategy relies on the 
conversion of alcohols and ketones  widely found in nature and within commercial 
catalogues and relatively easy to prepare by many known methods  into valuable 
functionalized products. Though several groups have explored deoxytrifluoromethylation 
reactions of sp3hybridized systems2935, extrapolation of these systems to promote 
reactions of phenol derivatives to deliver ArCF3 have not yet been reduced to practice. In some cases, phenols can be converted to the corresponding aryl trifluoromethanes 
through multistep sequences in low yields (Fig. 1B)36.
