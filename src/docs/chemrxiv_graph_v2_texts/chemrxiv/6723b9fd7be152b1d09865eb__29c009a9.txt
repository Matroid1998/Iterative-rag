Consequently, molecular systems targeting Grich NAs 
folding into G4 have been widely explored for the 
development of new therapeutic and biomedical 
approaches. In this frame, Neidles group and our 
research unit have explored Naphthalene diimides 
(NDIs) and coreextended NDIs (ceNDIs) as very 
versatile platforms for the design of new molecular 
systems able to perform a variety of functions 
targeting NAs.
