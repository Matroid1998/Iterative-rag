Description:
A metal whose penetration in solid-state batteries limits the plating rate during charging.

Text:
Lithiummetal penetration is one of the main modes of cell failure in solidstate batteries 
and limits the plating rate during charging1. While some researchers have described lithium
metal structures penetrating the electrolyte as dendrites, the morphology of the lithium metal is 
not necessarily treelike2,3. As an alternative, we here use the term intrusions, defined as 
lithiummetal growth that electrochemically propagates within the solidstate electrolyte. Studying lithiummetal intrusions can aid in the development of inspection methods to screen out 
defective materials before they are incorporated into full devices. Further, a fundamental 
understanding of this intrusion process will enable the design of nextgeneration solidstate 
batteries that can remain stable over higher charge rates.

Description:
A metal that penetrates solid-state electrolytes and is influenced by electrochemical potential and stress.

Text:
The mechanism of lithiummetal penetration into solidstate electrolytes has been an 
important topic of scientific research since the seminal work of Monroe and Newman4. They 
predicted that solidstate electrolytes with a shear modulus 8 GPa would suppress lithium metal 
intrusion due to the dependence of the electrochemical potential of lithium on stress4. However, 
one of the most studied oxide solid electrolytes, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO, which is usually doped 
with Al, Ta, or Ga), has a shear modulus of 60 GPa5,6 but still exhibits intrusion growth at 
current densities well below 1 mA cm2 (averaged across the electrode)2,7, which is even lower 
than the threshold current density for liquid electrolytes. Recent theoretical studies resolve this
