Description:
An important porous metalcyanide framework structure with exchangeable cations.

Text:
Prussian blue (PB) is an important porous metalcyanide framework structure (AxFe3FeII(CN)6y.nH2O) with exchangeable A cations. Along 
with its analogs, it shows promise for a range of important applications13 including as cathodes in secondary ion batteries.410 Indeed, PB 
cathodes have potential in widespread, lowcost energy storage applications, using abundant and affordable Na or K based aqueous 
electrolytes.1012 In particular, K ions can be readily accommodated by the open structure of PB, which allows for reversable intercalation 
processes that are challenging in layered transition metal oxide cathodes. Despite the identified potential, unexpected complexities within the PB structure have made fundamental understanding of intercalation 
processes difficult.
