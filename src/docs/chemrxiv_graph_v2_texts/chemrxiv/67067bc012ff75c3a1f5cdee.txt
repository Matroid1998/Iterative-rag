Description:
Isomeric compounds that can be distinguished using multistage fragmentation in mass spectrometry.

MS3 can 
additionally reveal the exact position of the sugar by presenting unique fragment signals.13,16 
Accordingly, multistage fragmentation can be used to distinguish structural isomers, which 
has also been demonstrated for isomeric prostaglandins.14 One challenge in acquiring MSn 
data is the extended time required to capture a full spectral tree, which is often done using 
flow injection analysis or direct injection. Here, we present a new open resource consisting of data acquisition methods, data analysis 
software, and a freely accessible MSn library (MSnLib). We designed a novel method for high
throughput analysis and applied it to 34,413 unique compounds. For 30,008 compounds, we 
obtained fragmentation trees covering positive, negative, or both ion modes, which was 
achieved in a mere 23 days.
