Description:
A greenhouse gas that can be converted into sustainable fuels and chemicals via photo or electrochemical approaches.

The renewable generation of valuable chemicals and fuels is a critical step towards a 
sustainable and circular life cycle of chemicals.1, 2 The valorisation of abundant waste 
resources, such as lignocellulosic biomass and the greenhouse gas CO2 offers great potential 
to achieve such an ambitious goal. By harnessing the power of renewable energy sources, 
such as solar and wind, the conversion of nonedible biomass and CO2 via photo or 
electrochemical approaches presents an opportunity to produce sustainable fuels and 
chemicals.3 
Lignocellulosic biomass such as wood, is abundant and cheap and consists predominantly of 
three polymeric components cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.4, 
5 Cellulose and 
hemicellulose consist mainly of polysaccharose made from glucose, xylose, mannose and 
arabinose.
