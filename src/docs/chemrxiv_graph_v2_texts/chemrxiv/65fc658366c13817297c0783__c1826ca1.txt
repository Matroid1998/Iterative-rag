Description:
Surfaces that organic acids strongly adsorb onto, influencing physicochemical properties.

Text:
Regarding the role of OM in P adsorption, organic acids demonstrate a strong affinity to adsorb 
onto Al and Fehydroxide surfaces, influencing various physicochemical properties of reactive 
surfaces. These properties include specific surface area, reactive OH groups, surface charge, and 
electrostatic properties, consequently altering the interactions between phosphates and the 
adsorption sites (Gu et al., 1994; Kaiser and Guggenberger, 2003; Yan et al., 2016). Moreover,
