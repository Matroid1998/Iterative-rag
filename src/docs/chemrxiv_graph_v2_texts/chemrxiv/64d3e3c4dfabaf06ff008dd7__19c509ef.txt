Description:
Biosynthesis is mediated by complex enzymatic machinery.

Text:
For example, researchers have used lipid 
membranes 
as 
drugdelivery 
carriers, 
for 
reconstituting 
membrane associated proteins, as models for understanding the 
originoflife, and as compartments for synthetic cell models.14 
While the capability of phospholipids to selfassemble into 
membranes is well characterized, the de novo synthesis and 
formation of phospholipid membranes remains both challenging 
and limited in scope.5 The biosynthesis of phospholipids is 
mediated by complex enzymatic machinery,68 and these 
enzymes are often difficult to fully reconstitute in vitro, especially 
without a preexisting membranebound environment.4 An 
alternative and potentially simpler approach is to develop highly 
efficient, nonenzymatic and chemoselective strategies for 
synthesizing phospholipids from watersoluble precursors.9 
Previous work has demonstrated that various bioconjugation 
chemistries can be used to generate phospholipid species in 
water, but past studies have suffered from one or more of several 
drawbacks such as lack of biocompatibility of the reactants, the 
formation of unnatural linkages, or poor reaction kinetics in 
physiologically relevant conditions.1012 These issues have 
precluded the use of such chemistries to generate synthetic 
phospholipids in living cells.
