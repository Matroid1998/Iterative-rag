Description:
Ligands that can be modified by FeCl3 to form MOF intermediates with bandgaps ranging from 2.12 eV to 0.69 eV.

Ligand amino groups were also used for incorporation 
of transition metal ions for enhanced light absorption and 
bandgap tuning.61 A type of noncovalent PSM by introducing 
amine vapor and generating stable radical anions on MOF lig
ands via photoinduced electron transfer has also been demon
strated to effectively reduce the bandgap and extend absorption 
over the entire visible range.45 
The PSM of polyphenylenebased ligands using oxidative de
hydrogenation was shown previously to efficiently tune the 
bandgap of Zrbased MOFs.62 Here, we extend these studies by 
showing that a simple reagent, FeCl3, can be used to addition
ally modify nanographene ligands to form MOF intermediates 
(INT1, INT2, INT3 and INT4) with bandgaps that range 
from 2.12 eV to 0.69 eVs (Scheme 1).
