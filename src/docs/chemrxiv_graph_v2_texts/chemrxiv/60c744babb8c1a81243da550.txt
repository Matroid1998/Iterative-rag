Description:
A semiconductor material used in the growth and characterization of nanostructures.

Text:
One key parameter in 
electrochemical deposition is the applied potential, a fine 
tuning knob for stoichiometry, crystal structure and growth rate 
that does not exist in any other synthetic method. In this work we report the growth and characterisation of InAs 
nanostructures as a platform to understand the macroscopic 
electrochemically mediated growth of IIIV semiconductors. We 
use Raman spectroscopy as means to probe the crystal quality 
and grain size as a function of deposition potential. We find that 
the average InAs grain size systematically decreases with 
increasing the cathodic voltage (from 30 to 10 nm), 
particularly after a certain critical potential. We explain our 
findings by the interplay between selfdiffusion in the solid
state reaction rate, the voltagedependent deposition rate and 
activation of spurious electrochemical reactions.

Description:
A platform used for optimizing optoelectronic properties in III-V bimetallic compounds.

Text:
This finding 
opens up the possibility to control the crystal grain size with 
potential to optimize the optoelectronic properties for specific 
applications. Even though we have used InAs as platform, our 
results can be used as guideline for the optimization of other III
V bimetallic compounds.
