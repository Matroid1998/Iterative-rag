Description:
Consumed in large amounts in the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production.

These am
monia based crop nutrients result in much improved yields; it has been estimated that
almost half of the population on Earth are currently fed because of synthetic nitrogen based
fertilizer.1 Market demand for NH3, currently the second most produced chemical due to
use in fertilizers, nitric acids, explosives, pharmaceuticals, dyes, polymers, artificial fibers,
and many other products, is expected to increase 6 over the next 4 years and 40 by
2050.2,3 Additional demand will occur as there is a growing interest in using ammonia as a
liquified fuel in power applications.4,5 Commercial ammonia production uses the thermocat
alytic based HaberBosch (HB) process which consumes large amounts of pure hydrogen,
obtained mostly from a steam reforming process using a natural gas feedstock.
