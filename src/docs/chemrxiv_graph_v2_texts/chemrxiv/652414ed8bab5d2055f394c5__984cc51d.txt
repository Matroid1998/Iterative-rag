Description:
A metathesis process involving the cleavage and reconstruction of CC and CO bonds to prepare new olefin and carbonyl compounds.

Those transformations have demonstrated their 
applicability in the synthesis of myriad of organic compounds, significantly propelling 
approaches 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
pharmaceuticals,68 
materials911 
and 
agrochemicals.12,13 The groundbreaking example of such reactivity was highlighted by 
the 2005 Nobel Prize for the development of olefin metathesis, which allows a 
construction of new CC motif by metalcatalyzed cleavage of two starting CC units 
(Fig. 1A).1416 Catalyst tuning allows to control the substitution pattern and the 
stereochemistry of the newly formed CC bond.1726 

A complementary functionalization of olefins is known as carbonylolefin 
metathesis, which involves the cleavage and reconstruction of CC and CO bonds 
to prepare new olefin and carbonyl compound (Fig. 1B). This transformation can be 
achieved either through PaternBchi reaction27 or via Lewis acidcatalyzed 
CCCO 22cycloaddition2830 followed by oxetane fragmentation.

Reactions 
mediated by metal alkylidene were also developed.31 Another valuable approach is 
the indirect hydrazinecatalyzed carbonylolefin metathesis, which involves the 32
cycloadditioncycloreversion of in situ formed azomethine imine and olefin.32 This 
chemistry has had a significant impact on synthetic methods, particularly in the 
construction of new alkene functionalities.33
