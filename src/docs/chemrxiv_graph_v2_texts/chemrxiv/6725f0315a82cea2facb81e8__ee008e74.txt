Description:
A complex involved in zirconocene-catalyzed olefin polymerization.

Text:
Methylaluminoxane (MAO)1 is the most widely used activator 
for zirconocenecatalyzed olefin polymerization. Its basic 
mechanism of action is depicted in Scheme 1, illustrated using a 
particularly wellstudied, ansametallocene complex rac
Me2Si(5C9H6)2ZrMe2 (SBIZrMe2); in addition to propene 
polymerization studies2 involving both MAO and other 
activators,3 NMR spectroscopic techniques have been used to 
study the activation process,4 as well as UVVis spectroscopy in 
this specific case.5 The latter technique shows that at least two 
contact ionpairs (CIP) 1 and 2 are formed in varying amounts as 
a function of the AlZr ratio used for catalyst activation.
