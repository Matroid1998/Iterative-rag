Description:
An oxidation-sensitive dye used for fluorescence detection in model emulsions at cryogenic temperatures.

Text:
We could observe aggregation of proteins in the aqueous phase 
36 
upon oxidation, however, without employing fluorescence microscopy and cryoTEM in a correlative manner. 37 
Here, we build on our previous work and image the lipid oxidation of oil droplets in fluorescence microscopy at 
38 
cryogenic temperatures. We first introduce a homebuilt cryoupright fluorescence microscope (cryoFM) for 
39 
correlative imaging and test the setup with fluorescent beads. We then demonstrate fluorescence detection of an 
40 
oxidationsensitive dye, BODIPY 665676, in egg yolk stabilized model emulsions at cryogenic temperature (77 
41 
K). In addition, we observe protein granules at the oil droplet interfaces of fresh and oxidized emulsions using 
42 
cryoTEM.
