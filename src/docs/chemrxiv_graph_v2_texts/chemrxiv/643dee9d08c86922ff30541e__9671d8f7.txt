Description:
Ligands that form propeller-shaped molecules in lanthanide complexes.

Text:
Unique lanthanide complexes with dibenzoylmethane (DBM) ligands, which are propeller
shaped molecules, have been studied both for their structural characteristics 15 and for
applicationoriented synthesis. 6 Compounds of lanthanides with 3 oxidation states are im
portant for nuclearfuel processing 7,8 and magnetic resonance imaging. 911
