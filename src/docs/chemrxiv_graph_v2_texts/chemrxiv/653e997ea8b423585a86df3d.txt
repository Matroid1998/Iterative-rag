Description:
A component of carbon nanotubes, which are cylindrical 1D materials with exceptional optoelectronic properties.

Such a method would require minimal adaption of assays as the signal amplifier could be 
added during the readout step. Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical 1D materials with 
exceptional optoelectronic properties. Semiconducting singlewalled carbon nanotubes 
(SWCNTs) do not photobleach and fluoresce in the nearinfrared region (NIR, 870
2400 nm).20 In this spectral window, the absorption, scattering and autofluorescence of 
biological samples is reduced.21,22 Depending on the application, different spectral ranges are 
advantageous.23 Moreover, the fluorescence of SWCNTs is sensitive to the chemical 
environment.24 As such, they present an interesting building block for fundamental studies2527 
and have been used in a variety of optical24,2830 and electrochemical18,31 biosensing formats.
