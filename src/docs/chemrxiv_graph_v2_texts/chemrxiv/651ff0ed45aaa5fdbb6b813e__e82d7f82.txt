Description:
Type of redoxin involved in redox biology.

Text:
The highly conserved, 
upstream oxidoreductases that supply reducing equivalents for these 
many reaction manifolds are attractive targets as the central nodes of 
thioldisulfide redox biology particularly the dithioltype redoxins, 
including 
the 
thioredoxinthioredoxin 
reductase 
system 
(TrxTrxR), the glutaredoxinglutathioneglutathione reductase 
system (GrxGSHGR), and a handful of related proteins.13 
There are tremendous untapped opportunities for small molecule 
approaches that are chemocompatible with these dithioldisulfide 
chemistries (or even selectively address certain oxidoreductases), 
and that work effectively and noninvasively in live cells. Such 
reagents may drive basic research into biological redox dynamics and 
regulation, support translational medicine with redox or 
metabolicallygated diagnostics and therapeutics, or contribute in 
many other ways to the broader field of chemical biology.
