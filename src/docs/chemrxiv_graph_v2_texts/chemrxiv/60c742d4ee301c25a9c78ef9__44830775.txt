Description:
Combined with titanium precursors in the synthesis of amorphous TiSiO2 nanoparticles.

The particle size can be 
tuned by varying the temperature and crystallization 
time, whereas the porosity is typically controlled in the 
mesoporous range by the addition of templates  e.g. organosilanes  that prevent the fusion of the 
crystallites, or by leveraging on the grinding and drying 
steps of the gel prior to autoclaving 32. Alternatively, 
Schwieger and coworkers showed that mesoporous 
silica and aluminosilicate nanoparticles could be used 
both as hard template and precursors in the synthesis of 
micromacroporous silicalite and ZSM5 by SAC, 
respectively 33,34. Herein, we propose to combine titanium and 
silicon precursors in the synthesis of amorphous Ti
SiO2 nanoparticles and to use the latters in the 
preparation of hierarchical TS1 material featuring both 
a micromacroporosity and large crystal size.
