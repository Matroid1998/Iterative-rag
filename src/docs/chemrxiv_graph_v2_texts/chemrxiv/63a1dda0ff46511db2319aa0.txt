Notably, Deng et al.28
used kMC to estimate the conductivity of Na in solid elec
trolytes Na1xZr2Px Si3xO12, as a function of Na content and
temperature, eventually sampling a vast compositional, spa
tial, and temporal scale. kMC can also be used to examine the
structural evolution of nanoparticles as well, as demonstrated
by Li et al.35. kMC is based on a stochastic algorithm which randomly
samples various microstates of a given system, utilizing the
ergodic principle to arrive at statisticallyaveraged transport
properties. Thus, the chief advantage of kMC over MD is the
ability of kMC to access long timescales (ms) and large
lengthscales (m) compared to what is usually possible in
MD (s, nm)40.
