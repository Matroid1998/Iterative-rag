Description:
A cationic amino acid residue that enables strong binding to negatively charged DNA phosphates.

In somatic cells, the base 
unit of chromatin is the nucleosome consisting of DNA 
wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins to form a 
bead on a string structure.13 In mature sperm cells, the 
vast majority (90) of somatic histones ultimately get 
replaced during spermatogenesis by cationic peptides 
known as protamines.45 These protamines are short (48 
kDa), highly basic peptides that contain 5070 arginine 
residues.6 The high number of cationic arginine residues 
enables a strong binding to negatively charged DNA 
phosphates resulting in a nearcrystalline condensation of 
the DNA in sperm chromatin to a volume roughly 6 times 
more compact than is achieved by mitotic chromosomes.67 
Sperm chromatin, like viruses, therefore represent some of 
the tightest packaging of DNA in vivo.
