Description:
Used in inorganic shells to enhance chemical stability and photoluminescence.

Text:
Inorganic shells, typically Cd and Zn
based, are grown on the cores to improve their chemical stability and photoluminescence (PL).26 These 
coreshell QDs, composed of materials with different band gaps and band alignments, show a variety of 
optical properties due to the overall composition and shell thickness.
