Description:
Synthesized via a bifurcating chemoenzymatic domino Knoevenagel-acylation-hydrolysis-protonolysis three-component synthesis.

4Methoxy ringsubstituted methyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in syntheses of 
highly substituted cyclohexanes and cyclopentenes via phosphinecatalyzed chemo and 
diastereoselective 2  2  2 and 3  2 annulations of methyl allenoates with doubly 
activated olefins 1; in azaWittig reaction with nitriles 2; in a bifurcating 
chemoenzymatic domino Knoevenagelacylationhydrolysisprotonolysis threecomponent 
synthesis of cyano (hetero)aryl acrylates andor amides 3; in synthesis and biological 
evaluation of spiroacenaphthylene1,2pyrrolidine derivatives as potent antiinfective 
agents 4; and in synthesis of dihydrouracils spirofused to pyrrolidines leading to druglike 
molecules based on the 2arylethyl amine scaffold 5. 4Ethoxy ringsubstituted ethyl PCA 
was involved in stereoselective synthesis of trans4,5substituted 1,4,5,6tetrahydropyridine
2(olates)thiolates 6 and studies of stereochemistry of interaction of pyridinium ylides with 
,unsaturated nitriles 7.
