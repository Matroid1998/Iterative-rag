Description:
A manganese oxide with an orthorhombic structure built on SrO8 polyhedra sharing corners and edges with Mn tetrahedra.

Inorganic compounds containing pentavalent manganese (Mn5) are scarce due to their low 
stability.9 Currently reported manganese oxides built on Mn(V) are Ba3Mn2O8,5,6 KBaMnO4,9 
Ba5(MnO4)3OH,10 Ba5(MnO4)3X (X  Cl,11,12 F12,13), KSrMnO4,14 Sr5MnO43OH,9,10 and its 
derivatives Sr5(Mn1xSix)O43(OH)13x (x  0.053),9 Sr5(MnO4)3(OH)1yFy (y  0.90),9 and 
Sr5(Mn1xSix)O43F13x (x  0.058).9 In all these compounds, Mn(V) is found in tetrahedral 
coordination, MnVO43, and always in combination with alkali (A) andor alkalineearth (AE) metal 
ions, barium and strontium, as these elements exhibit a basicity high enough to stabilize MnVO 
bonds with a strong covalent character.9 In this work, we focus on the SrMnO system, that 
encompasses two structural entries KSrMnO4 and Sr5(MnO4)3OH (Figure 1). KSrMnO4 has an 
orthorhombic structure built on SrO8 polyhedra14 sharing corners and edges with Mn tetrahedra.
