Description:
Undergoes ring opening during oxidative decarboxylation.

Text:
During 
the catalytic process, the substrate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation reaction, which 
results in the opening of the imidazole ring. This step initiates the release of carbon 
dioxide and the production of coelenteramide in the first singlet excited state (S1). The
