Description:
A commercialized drug used in photodynamic therapy to target tumors.

Text:
Numerous chemical reagents were developed for photodynamic therapy (PDT) since the ground 
breaking discovery that eosin can be used to treat skin tumors.17 Commercialized drugs, such as 
porfimer sodium (Photofrin), 5aminolevulinic acid (ALA), methyl aminolevulinate (MAL), and 
methyl aminooxopenoat (MAOP), demonstrated the power of using light to target internal and skin 
tumors.810 In general, PDT relies upon generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon 
photoactivation that can damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, eventually triggering cell 
death or protein inactivation.1,11,12 Recently, ROSinduced oxidative modifications of amyloid 
(A) peptides have been recognized as an effective method for controlling their aggregation 
pathways that are directly linked to the pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD).13 Oxidation of A 
peptides with photosensitizers14 or redoxactive molecules1520 may alter their abnormal assembly 
and improve cognitive defects in AD transgenic mice.
