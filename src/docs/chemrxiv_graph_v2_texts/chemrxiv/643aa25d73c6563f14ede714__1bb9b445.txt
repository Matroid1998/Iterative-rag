Text:
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a toxic, colorless, and irritating gas with
a strong odor. It is a potent atmospheric pollutant capable of causing
severe health and environmental hazards and thus is extensively moni
tored with ongoing efforts to reduce its emissions. However, despite the
efforts, SO2 pollution remains a persistent issue. On one hand, natural
processes like volcanic activity, geothermal springs, organic matter de
composition, and anaerobic bacterial reduction remain constant sources
of SO2 1, 2. On the other, anthropogenic activities such as power
generation from fossil fuels, oil refining, and heating via combustion
of coal and natural gas remain the major contributors to the total emis
sions 36.
