Description:
Used as nucleophilic donors in aldol condensation reactions.

Text:
Aldol condensations are one 
of the most fundamental tools for CC bond formation in 
organic synthesis,26 and accordingly conjugation to protein 
aldehyde functionalities via aldolenolatetype chemistries 
represents a popular method via which CC bond formation 
between small molecule probes and proteins can be 
achieved.20, 2730 Existing examples of such bioconjugation 
chemistries include Knoevenagel condensation,27, 28 aldol 
condensation using 2,4thiazolidinediones as nucleophilic 
donors29 and organocatalystmediated protein aldol ligation.20 
Herein we introduce spontaneous coupling via aldol ligation of 
proteins (SCALP), a facile and gentle siteselective CC bond 
forming bioconjugation method between reactive oxo 
aldehyde functionalities on proteins and enolisable aldehyde 
probes (Figure 1).
