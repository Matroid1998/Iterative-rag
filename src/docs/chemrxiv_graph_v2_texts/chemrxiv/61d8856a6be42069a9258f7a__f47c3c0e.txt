Description:
A compound involved in the Fischer indole synthesis.

Aromatic sigmatropic rearrangements involving dearomatized intermediates andor products often 
leverage a heteroatom to facilitate and favor dearomatization andor aromatic functionalization. This is 
because of the generally favorable kinetics and thermodynamics of such systems. As such, there is a rich 
variety of heteroatomic 1,5diene substrates classes reported in (Figure 1A),120 including many named 
reactions (aromatic Claisen21 and SommeletHauser22 rearrangements; Fischer indole synthesis23). The all
carbon analogs (1,5dienes; Cope rearrangement substrates24) are more challenging, energetically 
speaking.25 They are innately unfavorable rearrangements thermodynamically (DG  0). This degeneracy can 
be broken in productive ways (e.g. the oxyCope rearrangement26) or unproductive ways (e.g. the aromatic 
Cope rearrangement) (Figure 1B).
