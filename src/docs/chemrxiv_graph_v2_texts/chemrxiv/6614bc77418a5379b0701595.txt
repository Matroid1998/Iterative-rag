Description:
A nutrient whose concentration in wastewater treatment plant effluents is being regulated.

Text:
Notably, exceedances of water quality thresholds for total dissolved solids, biological 
oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand occur frequently and globally.6 Furthermore, 
regions and nations including the EU and the U.S. are considering and advancing policies and 
regulations that will require lower nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorous) concentrations in WWTP 
effluents.7,8 Without intervention, addressing the need for more extensive wastewater treatment 
to address these challenges will increase WWTP energy consumption and GHG emissions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024h5pfc ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000220655106 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
