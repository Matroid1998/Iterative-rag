Description:
Dispersed Fe atoms in FeNC-based SANs exhibit superior peroxidase-like characteristics.

Text:
Singleatom nanozymes (SANs), a type of nanozyme characterized by atomically dispersed active 
sites, process ultrahigh enzymelike activity and excellent chemical stability, endowing them with 
unique catalytic performance 31. Recently, Febased SANs with dispersed Fe atoms, known as 
FeNCbased SANs, have shown superior peroxidaselike characteristics 32. The excellent 
catalytic performance of FeNC SANs for H2O2 makes them widely used in various sensor
