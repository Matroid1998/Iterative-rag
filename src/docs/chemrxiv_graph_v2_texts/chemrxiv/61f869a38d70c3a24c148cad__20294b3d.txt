Description:
Adsorb on surfaces, often present in indoor air and pump systems, contributing to high water contact angles.

Text:
According to that explanation, valence electron orbitals of the cerium atoms in 
CeO2 are protected by the electron octet 2s22p6 of crystalline oxygen which makes it difficult for water molecules to 
build chemical bonds with the surface. Later studies found, however, that asprepared REOs show intrinsic 
hydrophilicity, and attributed high water contact angles (WCA) to adsorption of hydrocarbons which often are present 
in indoor air and pump systems 610. Surface cleaning with high temperature annealing or with plasma treatment 
11 are able to switch the wetting behavior of REOs from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity. The hydrocarbon 
adsorption usually occurs at surface defects such as oxygen vacancies and adsorbed OH groups, or by physical 
adsorption on the locally ideal surface 11.

Description:
Substances used to enhance the hydrophobicity of CeO2 by being deposited on its surface.

Text:
So, the nature of the hydrophobicity of CeO2 still remains unclear. The goal of the current study is to investigate which factors control the wetting behavior of CeO2. We report how to 
enhance hydrophobicity of CeO2 by texturizing the substrate surface and depositing hydrocarbons. The clear 
understanding of the parameters governing hydrophobicity and their relationship might accelerate research and 
implementation of the material in reallife applications. 2. Experimental details 
The principal way to achieve the superhydrophobic state with WCA above 150 is through the creation of surface 
roughness by surface texturization 12. It should be mentioned that besides helping to achieve the superhydrophobic 
condition, the advanced surface morphology reduces reflection from the material and therefore makes it advantageous 
for use in PV applications.
