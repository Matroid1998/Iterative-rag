Description:
A thiopurine prodrug used in the treatment of leukemia and autoimmune conditions.

Text:
Thiopurine prodrugs azathioprine (Aza) and 6mercaptopurine (6MP) figure in the World 
Health Organization top one hundred list of essential medicines and are prescribed for the 
treatment of leukemia, autoimmune conditions, and as immunosuppressants.1 Although they are 
highly effective medications, longterm treatment of patients with thiopurine prodrugs is 
associated with a 10fold increase in basal cell carcinomas and a 65 to 250fold increase in 
squamous cell carcinomas.2 These side effects are induced by exposure to sunlight,35 which is 
thought to originate from the ability of thiopurine derivatives to absorb UVA radiation (320400 
nm).6 Indeed, UVA irradiation of cells treated with Aza and 6MP causes photochemical damage, 
increasing oxidatively generated damage of both the genome and the proteome.7, 8 The 
photochemical properties of 6thioguanosine (6tGuo), a clinicallyactive metabolite of these 
prodrugs,3, 9, 10 have received widespread attention6, 1118 because is thought to be the root cause 
of the mutagenic damage.
