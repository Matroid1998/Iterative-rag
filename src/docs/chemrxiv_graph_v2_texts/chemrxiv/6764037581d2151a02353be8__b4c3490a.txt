If unaddressed, AMR is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths 
annually by 2050, surpassing cancer as a leading cause of mortality (ONeill, 2016). The pharmaceutical industry 
relies heavily on elements such as aluminium and potassium due to their diverse applications in drug formulations. Aluminiumbased compounds, such as aluminium hydroxide, are widely used as antacids to manage gastric 
acidity, while aluminium sulfate serves as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance immune responses (Sweetman, 2011; 
WHO, 2019). Similarly, potassiumbased compounds play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance in the 
body. For example, potassium chloride is commonly used to treat hypokalemia and prevent cardiac arrhythmias, 
whereas potassium citrate helps manage kidney stones by increasing urinary citrate excretion (Kaplan, 2018; 
Curhan et al., 1993).
