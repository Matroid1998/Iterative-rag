Description:
Used for acidification in the synthesis of oxetanecarboxylic acids.

Text:
In our case, many oxetanecarboxylic 
acids easily isomerized under simple storage or slight heating 
and required no external catalysis. Results and Discussion. Unexpected discovery. Previously, 
we developed an approach to spirocyclic pyrrolidines via 
32cycloaddition.9 As a part of this project, we synthesized 
several 
oxetanecarboxylic 
acids. In 
particular, 
alkali 
saponification of ester 1 followed by acidification with 
NaHSO4 gave crude acid 1a. At that time, we obtained pure 
product 1a by simple washing the crude product with MeOtBu 
to remove soluble impurities. Inspection of this product three 
months later revealed the presence of ca. 25 of the individual 
impurity according to 1H NMR. After one year of storage at 
room temperature, ca. 50 of this impurity was present.
