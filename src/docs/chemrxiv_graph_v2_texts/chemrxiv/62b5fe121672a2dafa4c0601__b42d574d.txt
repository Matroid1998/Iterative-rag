Description:
Studied as derivatives for potential anticancer agents.

Text:
4Bromo ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in vitro, 
molecular docking, and ADME study of uracil derivatives as potential anticancer agents 
1; in synthesis of novel selenophenes from activated acetylenes, such as ethyl 2cyano
3arylacrylate and potassium selenocyanate 2; in Knoevenagel condensation in the 
presence of polyoxomolybdates as efficient catalysts 3; in preparation of highly loaded 
MWCNTpolyamine hybrids and their application in catalysis 4; in catalysis studies on 
precise control of the oriented layered double hydroxide nanosheets growth on graphene 
oxides leading to efficient catalysts for cascade reactions 5, and in synthesis of 
arylidene derivatives by microwave assisted NH4OAc catalyzed under solvent free 
condition 6.
