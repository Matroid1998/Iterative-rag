Description:
MOF material involved in controlling competitive pathways in electron-hole recombination.

Text:
The analysis of the decays shows also that the electronhole recombine 
radiatively with different lifetimes varying from the hundreds of ns to the s time scale, suggesting the 
presence of heterogenous trapping environments in the materials. In additions, timeresolved 
measurements also revealed that the (eh) formation is in competition with the formation of excimers 
or energy transfer. The role of the topology of the MOFs framework in controlling these competitive 
pathways has also been evidenced for Zr(pbenzoic acid)pyrene MOF materials (NU901, NU1000)16 
and in MOF PCN223, for which a hopping mechanism of energy transfer from the excited 
chromophores to Nprotonated linkers acting as traps has been proposed.17 The titaniumbased MOF 
family MIL125(Ti) have also attracted a lot of attention for solar fuel generation.
