Description:
The hallmark residue of all CYP450 enzymes, serving as an axial thiolate ligand.

Due to the versatility in 
functions and the capability of activating the CH bond which is a commercially important process, 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) provides an ideal scaffold for bioengineering through directed 
evolution.111 The native CYP450 uses molecular oxygen and attaches one oxygen to the substrate 
while the second oxygen is reduced as a water molecule.12,13 An axial thiolate ligand (Cysteine) 
that controls the electron density via the pushpull effect is the hallmark residue of all CYP450 
enzymes.14,15 Among the members of the P450 family, CYP450BM3 possesses the widest and most 
exposed substrateaccess channel, and exhibits as such the highest degree of promiscuity among 
CYP450s.
