Under photolytic conditions, 18
electron transition metal carbonyl complexes are prone to ligand dissociation to generate 
coordinatively unsaturated intermediates that can react with H2. For example, irradiation of 
mixtures M(CO)6 and H2 at low temperature leads to the formation of the corresponding 
dihydrogen complexes M(CO)5(2H2) (M  Cr, W).12 In contrast, photochemical reaction of 
Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2 with H2 leads to oxidative addition to form Ru(CO)2(PPh3)2(H)2.13 

Bimetallic transition metal carbonyl complexes such as Ru(5C5H5)(CO)22 also react with H2 
under photochemical conditions.14 In these cases, photolysis can promote either dissociation
