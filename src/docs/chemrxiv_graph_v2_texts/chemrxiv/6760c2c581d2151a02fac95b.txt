Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron (5, FeCp2 or Fc)), discovered in 1951, has since become a 
42 
cornerstone in organometallic chemistry due to its unique sandwich structure, which features a 
43 
central iron atom coordinated between two cyclopentadienyl rings. This unprecedented 
44 
configuration not only expanded the understanding of bonding in transition metal complexes but 
45 
also led to significant advancements in the field of organometallics, earning Geoffrey Wilkinson 
46 
and Ernst Otto Fischer the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973.
