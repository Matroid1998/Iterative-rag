Description:
A compound used in fertilizers to improve food production.

Text:
Nitrogen fixation, either by natural nitrogen fixation within the soil or by manufactured
ammoniabased fertilizers such as liquid ammonia (NH3), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3),
and other nitrogen based compounds substantially improves food production.

Description:
Used in fertilizers, nitric acids, explosives, pharmaceuticals, dyes, polymers, and artificial fibers.

These am
monia based crop nutrients result in much improved yields; it has been estimated that
almost half of the population on Earth are currently fed because of synthetic nitrogen based
fertilizer.1 Market demand for NH3, currently the second most produced chemical due to
use in fertilizers, nitric acids, explosives, pharmaceuticals, dyes, polymers, artificial fibers,
and many other products, is expected to increase 6 over the next 4 years and 40 by
2050.2,3 Additional demand will occur as there is a growing interest in using ammonia as a
liquified fuel in power applications.4,5 Commercial ammonia production uses the thermocat
alytic based HaberBosch (HB) process which consumes large amounts of pure hydrogen,
obtained mostly from a steam reforming process using a natural gas feedstock.

Description:
Produced using the HB reaction under elevated temperature and high pressure on an iron or ruthenium catalyst.

Current
ammonia production operations have been optimized for energy efficiency in very large in
dustrial facilities.6,7 The HB reaction proceeds under elevated temperature (350550 C)
and high pressure (150350 atm) on an iron or ruthenium catalyst to ensure faster reaction
rates in producing the NH3.810 It relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily natural gas) and
releases over 438.5  37.1 metric tons of the greenhouse gas CO2 annually (2022), accounts
for about 2 of total energy consumption in 2020, and 1.3 of global CO2 emissions.3,11,12
A substantial amount of ammonia becomes a feedstock for nitric acid (HNO3) which is
also a high demand Ncontaining chemical, via the Ostwald process.1315 The reliable, energy
efficient Ostwald process for manufacturing nitric acid consists of a high temperature (over
