Description:
A nucleophilic species formed from the deprotonation of cysteine.

Text:
Experimental exchangerate studies have shown
18
that the equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated states of solventexposed cysteine
19
side chains is fast15 (i.e., 1012  M1s1) and that the protonation rate and pKa are well corre
20
lated.15,16 That is to say, the pKa of a particular cysteine provides the relevant information about
21
the energy required to form the nucleophilic thiolate and, by extension, the propensity for covalent
22
modification. 23
Experimental methods for determining the pKa value of a cysteine can involve kinetic assays,
24
spectrophotometric titrations, or NMR spectroscopy; however, in a purely computational in silico
25
screen of potential covalent modifiers, the ability to rapidly and accurately probe the reactivity of
26
a target cysteine under various conditions is highly desirable.
