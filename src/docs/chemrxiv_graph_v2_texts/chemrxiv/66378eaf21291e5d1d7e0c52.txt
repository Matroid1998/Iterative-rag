Description:
A drug discovered using computer-aided drug design (CADD) methods.

Text:
The 
adoption of CADD methods is rapidly increased due to their 
potential to significantly reduce the cost and time of a new 
drug development.22 CADD can be used in both purposes 
including searching for new inhibitors and repurposing for 
existing drugs.2325 CADD has been donating to the discovery 
of severally available drugs such as dorzolamide,2627 
saquinavir, ritonavir, and indinavir.21 
In this work, we aim to use a combination of computa
tional and experimental approaches to find potential inhibi
tors for inhibiting neuraminidase. In particular, the trained 
machine learning (ML) model was employed to predict the 
ligandbinding affinity of ca. 2 million compounds of 
ChEMBL database to neuraminidase. The experimental stud
ies were then carried out to validate the ML outcomes. The 
shortlist of potential candidates were obtained.
