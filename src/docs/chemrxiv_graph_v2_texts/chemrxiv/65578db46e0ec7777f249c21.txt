Description:
A gas for which high-quality force fields accurately reproduce adsorption isotherms in all-silica zeolites.

Other authors have employed FFbased 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the diffusion of pharmaceuticals through zeolite 
structures in the context of drug delivery investigations.1416 
A crucial aspect in this regard is the suitability of the FF parameters to represent the relevant 
interatomic interactions in the system, especially the interactions between zeolite host and 
adsorbed molecules. For gas phase adsorption, a validation against experimental adsorption 
data is relatively straightforward, and highquality FFs that accurately reproduce adsorption 
isotherms for gases like CO2, CH4, N2, or O2 in allsilica zeolites have been developed.2326 
For larger organics that are adsorbed from the liquid phase, the situation is more complex, as
