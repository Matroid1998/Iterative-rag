Description:
Compounds that act as both promotor and acceptor in glycosylation reactions.

However, the true reaction picture is often much
more complicated.6
Glycosylation reactions are further
complicated by counterion effects, formation of ion pairs,
unexpected catalystpromotor interactions,610 solvent ef
fects,11,12 and substrate specificity.13 The key to devel
oping new and improved glycosylation methods might be
to get a better understanding of the mechanisms through
which they proceed. In 2019, Nielsen et. al. reported a
new glycosylation method relying on sulfonyl carbamates
as selfpromotors (a compound that acts as both promotor
and acceptor) and trichloroacetimidate glycosyl donors in
Nglycosylations (Scheme 1).14
