Description:
A compound synthesized and characterized in the study of NiII polymetallic clusters.

Text:
Indeed, recent studies of NiII SIMs at both 
ambient and high pressure6 have revealed how magnetic anisotropy is extremely susceptible to even 
small structural distortions, in turn highlighting target geometries7 and directing the synthetic 
methodologies required to engineer molecules possessing giant magnetoanisotropies.8 
Flexible N,Obridging ligands have proved particularly successful in the construction of polymetallic 
clusters of NiII displaying a variety of topologies and nuclearities, including supertetrahedra,9 wheels,10 
planar discs11 and icosahedra.12 The proligand (3,5dimethyl1Hpyrazol1yl)methanol (HL1) belongs 
in this family, having been employed to make both mono and tetranuclear clusters of NiII.13 Here, we 
expand 
this 
chemistry 
to 
include 
the 
synthesis, 
structure 
and 
characterisation 
of 
Ni14(HL2)12(HCOO)14Cl14(MeOH)(H2O)4Me2CO
