Transition metalcatalyzed intra
molecular 222 annulations13 by coupling two alkynes with ni
triles, which take advantage of using tethered diynes (Scheme 1B) to 
reduce the entropic penalty have been proven as an effective route 
to pyridines.14 Since the pioneering work of Wakatsuki and Yama
zaki on CpCo(I)catalyzed reactions,15 this cycloaddition has been 
extensively explored with the aid of various transition metal cata
lysts, including cobalt,16 nickel,17 iron,18 ruthenium,19 rhodium,20 and 
iridium,21 in addition to stoichiometric variants using exogenous 
metal additives. Relevant to this work, the intramolecular cyclization 
of two different alkynes could be achieved as well by tethering either 
the two alkynes or one alkyne with the nitrile moiety17b,18,20,21a,22 (Fig
ure 1B), thus allowing to control chemoselectivity.
