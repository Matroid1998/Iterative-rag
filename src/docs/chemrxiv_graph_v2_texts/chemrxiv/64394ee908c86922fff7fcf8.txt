of two different aryl groups 
of varied electronics, and the retained iodosubstituent enables downfield diversifications of the products. More than 20 
nucleophiles, including amines, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and halides, were alkylated with high functional group 
tolerance, and the strategy could be utilized in latestage functionalization of natural products and pharmaceuticals.
