Description:
Porous solids with applications in catalysis and chemical processes.

Text:
Porous materials, including metalorganic 
frameworks (MOFs), covalentorganic frameworks (COFs), porous polymers, and zeolites, have many 
applications as porous solids, with surface areas reaching as high as 7140 m2 g1 for the MOF NU110E.3 
Another subclass of porous materials are porous organic cages (POCs)  discrete molecules with 
permanent internal cavities accessible through windows, which may pack in the solidstate to form 
extended porous structures, but also typically exhibit solution processibility in common organic 
solvents.4 These advantageous features have gained POCs traction in the literature for their 
competitive porosities and guest selectivities, along with attractive applications in catalysis, chemical
