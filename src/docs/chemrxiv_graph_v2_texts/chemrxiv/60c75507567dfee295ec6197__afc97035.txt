With increasing the world population, the demand for quality life and food also increased. But 
48 
during the past few years, the approaches for the efficient management of fertilizers for the 
49 
production of required food quantity are facing persistent challenges in view of the world 
50 
population especially in developing countries like Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In Pakistan, 
51 
most farmers used nitrogenbased fertilizer due to the deficiency of nitrogen in soil 1, 2. 52 
Nitrogen (N) is found abundantly in the atmosphere but in this form, it is inaccessible for plants. 53 
It became only available when primary producers such as plants are converted dinitrogen gas 
54 
into ammonia (NH3).
