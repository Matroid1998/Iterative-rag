Description:
A drug used for Fe(II) decorporation and able to bind to all six vacancies of the Fe(II), making it a very strong ligand.

The proposed com
pounds had similar structures to that of deferoxamine (DFO), another drug used for Fe(II) decor
poration (see Figure 1). DFO is able to bind to all six vacancies of the Fe(II) making it a very strong
ligand. Studies have shown that DFO is a more effective decorporation agent than DFP. However,
it suffers from other issues, such as being poorly absorbed and some secondary effects.9 Thus, the
development of novel polypeptides able to strongly bind to all six vacancies of Al(III) can be a
highly promising approach to creating decorporation agent candidates.10 However, the effects of
this nonprotein aminoacid in the context of a polypeptide chain have not been explored.
