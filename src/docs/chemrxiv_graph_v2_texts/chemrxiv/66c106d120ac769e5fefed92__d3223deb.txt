carbon, often by 
coordination to dopant elements such as nitrogen, resulting in 
various MNC species.14,15 These materials offer unique 
advantages including strong metalsubstrate interactions,16 
tunable electronic structure of the active metal site as well as high 
electric conductivity, often resulting in excellent redoxcatalytic 
performance.1719 Also, the quasimolecular design of these 
materials enable optimum metalatom utilization and enable 
rational active site design at the atomic level.19,20 
However, particularly for ORR, monometallic SACs (often based 
on Fe, Co) are limited by unfavorable energetics for the binding 
of key oxygen intermediates (O2 and OOH), resulting in high O2 
activation barriers.19 In addition, monometallic SACs often show 
high overpotentials for the OER reaction, as water oxidation is 
favored at polynuclear species.20 
One promising strategy to overcome these challenges is the 
introduction of a second metal center, resulting in dual atom
