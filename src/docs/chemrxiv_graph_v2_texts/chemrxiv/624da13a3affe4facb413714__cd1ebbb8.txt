Description:
Helices that can interconvert between polyproline II with all trans amide bonds and polyproline I with all cis amide bonds.

In 
particular, we focused our efforts on the use of polyproline 
helices as SPF building blocks due to the accessibility to rigid yet 
stimuli sensitive secondary structures.25 Polyprolines can 
interconvert between two different secondary conformations, 
polyproline II with all trans amide bonds and polyproline I with 
all cis amide bonds. This interconversion can be controlled as a 
function of the environment it is exposed to (i.e. temperature, 
solvent polarity and pH).2628 Polyproline helices have shown 
remarkable resilience to a diverse range of functionalisation 
and, in contrast to other helices used in supramolecular 
chemistry,2931 can retain their conformation even in short 
sequences, highlighting the stability of these helices.32 These 
properties make them promising candidates for the synthesis of 
novel porous SPFs.
