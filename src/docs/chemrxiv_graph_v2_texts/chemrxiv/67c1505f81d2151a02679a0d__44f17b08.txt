Description:
A substrate used for CeO2 heteroepitaxy with a critical thickness less than 3 nm for strain control.

However, these approaches make 
it challenging to isolate electronic effects due to confounding factors such as heteroatoms, surface 
microstructures, and surface orientations, which also influence surface activity by altering reactive 
sites and surface charge distribution1719. Strain engineering through heteroepitaxy has shown 
promise in tuning the electronic structure of metals and semiconductors, enhancing activity and 
carrier mobility2023 while maintaining the surface structure. Yet, precise strain control in 4f 
systems over a large range remains difficult24,25, with recent study revealing that the critical 
thickness for CeO2 heteroepitaxy on yttriastabilized zirconia was less than 3 nm26, after which 
misfit dislocations relieve strain and produce polycrystalline films with varied surface terminations, 
leading to an inherent discrepancy compared with constructed models for theoretical calculations.
