Description:
A compound that includes fluorographene, noted for its reactivity and potential in forming graphene derivatives.

To overcome this problem, the use of functionalized 
precursors can be an appropriate solution.8 For this reason, 
fluorographene (FG), a perfluorinated hydrocarbon, took 
interest in the community due to its reactivity and the 
possibility to form several graphene derivatives through 
nucleophilic substitution with high degree of conversion.9 
In this context, coordination chemistry, and reticular design 
in particular, has given rise to a new route for the 
functionalization of 2D materials thanks to its greater chemical 
versatility and tunability, yielding to higher degrees of 
functionalization, if compared with those achieved in purely 
inorganic materials.10 Thus, the interest in finding 2D molecular 
analogues has increased, as they can be chemically tuned by the 
proper chemical design.11 The molecular nature of layered 
coordination 
polymers 
(LCPs) 
permits, 
a 
priori, 
the 
incorporation of different functionalization onto the 2D 
molecular material.
