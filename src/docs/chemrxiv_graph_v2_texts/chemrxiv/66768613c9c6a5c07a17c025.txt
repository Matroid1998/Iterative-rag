Encouragingly, the 
advent of B,Ncontaining multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR
TADF) materials with rigid skeletons shows great prospects for UHD displays.3 The highest 
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of MR
TADF molecules are alternately distributed on atoms of the rigid skeletons, forming MR 
transitions with shortrange charge transfer (SRCT) states,4 coupled with bondingantibonding 
characteristics, which suppress highfrequency vibrational coupling and relaxation, and 
ultimately generate highefficiency and highcolorpurity TADF, fundamentally solving the 
problem of narrowband emission.5 
Early research on MRTADF materials focused on bluelightemitting analogsderivatives 
derived from DABNA skeleton, while the exploration of longwavelength emitting materials 
lagged behind, hindering the progress of panchromatic image displays.6 Later, with the birth 
of skybluelightemitting star MR emitter BNCz (PL  481 nm, FWHM  22 nm),7 it bears a 
highly tunable chemical structure and has become an important carrier for the development of 
longwavelength MRTADF materials.
