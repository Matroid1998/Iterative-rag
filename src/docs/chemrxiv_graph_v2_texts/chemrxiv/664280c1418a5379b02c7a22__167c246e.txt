Description:
Refers to transition metal-based catalysts used in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Text:
The plasmagrown, nanoedgeenriched MoOxCy 
exhibits excellent acidic HER performance with a low overpotential of 415 mV at an ultrahigh 
current density of up to 10 A cm2 for 1,000 h. As a result, an ultrahigh H2 throughput of 4,477.4 
L cm2 is achieved, substantially surpassing the performance of stateoftheart transition metal 
and even noble metalbased catalysts. This work opens new avenues for the development of 
innovative catalysts suited for practical industrial electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Acknowledgements
