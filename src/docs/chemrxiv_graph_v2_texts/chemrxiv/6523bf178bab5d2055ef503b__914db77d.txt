Description:
Bent-shaped derivatives that are promising optoelectronic materials.

Text:
Polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) have 
attracted wide attention from the scientific community 
due to their prominent role as organic semiconductors 
and electroactive materials for the development of 
organic electronics.1 Linearly fused rigid systems, 
such as acenes, are considered paradigmatic organic 
semiconductors,2 but their general use is hampered by 
the decreased chemical stability associated to the 
extension of the length of the acene, a feature that can 
be qualitatively explained on the basis of Clars 
sextet rule.3 Angularly fused phenes, starphenes4 and 
other bentshaped oligoacene derivatives5 are also 
promising optoelectronic materials. Among the 
diverse families of PCHs, those containing fused four
membered cyclobutadienoid rings are particularly 
interesting due to the properties associated with the 
alternation of aromatic and antiaromatic ring currents 
in their structures.
