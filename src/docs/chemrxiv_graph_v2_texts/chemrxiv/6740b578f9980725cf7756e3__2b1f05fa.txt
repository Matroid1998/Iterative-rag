Description:
Unique building blocks for electronic and optoelectronic devices with properties like confined carrier transport and tunable band gap.

Text:
The relatively large, direct bandgap of 1.34 eV and high carrier 
mobilities, in particular, elevate InP above other semiconductors for use in highspeed 
electronics, such as heterojunction bipolar transistors and highelectronmobility transistors, and 
optoelectronics, such as singlephoton detectors and extraterrestrial photovoltaics.15 Beyond the 
bulk, InP nanowires are unique building blocks for electronic and optoelectronic devices due to 
additional properties like confined carrier transport in one dimension and a tunable band gap.1,6,7 
For example, InP nanowires have a large polarization sensitivity helpful for photodetection and 
are amenable to hybrid architectures, which enables complex device architectures such as 
avalanche photodetectors and dotinwire telecom emission devices.1,8,9 Additionally, InP 
nanowires can be doped and assembled to build precise electronic or optoelectronic devices, as 
demonstrated by an electroluminescent pn junction made of crossed InP nanowires from Lieber 
and coworkers.10
