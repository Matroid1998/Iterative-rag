The Advanced Research Projects Agency  Energy (ARPA
E) recently funded eight projects to develop novel nu
clear technologies to potentially transform carbonfree en
ergy sources and strengthen the nations advanced energy
endeavors13. New developments in nuclear fusion technolo
gies are based on the energy output of nuclear reactions be
tween light isotopes such as deuterium (symbol D), isotopic
helium (3He), and tritium (T).
