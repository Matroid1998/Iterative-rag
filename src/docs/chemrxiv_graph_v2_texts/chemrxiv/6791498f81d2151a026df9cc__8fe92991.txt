Description:
A metal that can alloy into high entropy borides.

Text:
In our previous work, Rosenberg et al. used the stabilization from high mixing entropy to force 
platinum to alloy into the high entropy boride (HEB) Al0.2Nb0.2Pt0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2B2. This was the highest 
coordinated platinumboride species reported thus far, a remarkable 12coordinated platinum 
boride phase.1 Platinum borides prior to the discovery of this HEB, were only boron poor phases 
with low platinum coordination Pt3B2 (platinum coordinated by 6 borons), PtB (platinum 
coordinated by 6 borons), and Pt2B (platinum coordinated by 3 borons).24 The fascination with 
forming a platinum high entropy diboride, comes from its unique crystal structure of alternating 
borophene sheets and metal (Figure 1). Platinum based catalysts are poisoned by ppm 
concentrations of sulfur.

Description:
Maintains high catalytic activity when shielded from sulfur by borophene.

Text:
Boron contributes sulfurresistivity for poisonresistant catalysis allowing 
it to avoid sulfur poisoning, even at elevated sulfur concentrations and enable a longer catalyst 
lifetime.57 What made Al0.2Nb0.2Pt0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2B2 remarkable was its ability to catalytically reduce 
4nitrothiophenol which contains a thiol group directly functionalized to the substrate. This would 
have been the worst possible test case for poisonresistant catalysts as the substrate itself is 
poisonous at 1,000 ppm loadings, far exceeding the sulfur tolerance of previous poisonresistant 
catalysts. This remarkable tolerance must be derived from the borophene sheets most important 
function; in that it shields platinum from sulfur, while maintaining its high catalytic activity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025018jg ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000256776970 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
