Description:
Incorporating organophosphonate ligands and metal ions for catalytic efficiency in Knoevenagel condensation.

Text:
Novel synthesis of 3
cyano2pyridones derivatives catalyzed by AuCoTiO2 involves 3chloro HECP 6. This 
HECP also was involved in the study of selenotungstates incorporating organophosphonate 
ligands and metal ions describing synthesis, characterization, magnetism and catalytic 
efficiency in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction 7. 4Chloro HECP was reported in 
the study new hybrid organicinorganic multifunctional materials based on polydopamine
like chemistry 8. 2Fluoro HECP was mentioned in study of optimized 
monofluoromethylsulfonium reagents for fluoromethylenetransfer chemistry 9. 3
