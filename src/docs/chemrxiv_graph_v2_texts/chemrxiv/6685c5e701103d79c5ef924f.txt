Description:
An element used as a source in metabolic studies to track biosynthesis and structural elucidation.

Text:
For example, researchers can grow an organism on a medium containing (13C)glucose 
54 
as the only carbon source to create a fully 13Csubstituted culture and subsequently feed any 
55 
precursor in its naturally abundant (i.e. primarily 12C) form and track its metabolism via mass 
56 
spectrometry. This technique has been used in natural product studies related to biosynthesis,4,5 
57 
structural elucidation,6 and discovery.7
