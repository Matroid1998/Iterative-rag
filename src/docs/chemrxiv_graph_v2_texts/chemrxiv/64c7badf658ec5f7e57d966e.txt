Description:
Electrode materials whose performances have been improved through heteroatom doping, compositing with pseudocapacitive materials, and structure optimisation.

In recent years, interest has risen in fastcharging energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, driven 
by the current climate and energy crises16. In the past three years alone, more than 20000 
publications have been published in this area7, and various approaches have been taken to attempt to 
improve the energy and power performances of supercapacitors. The performances of existing carbon 
electrode materials have been improved through heteroatom doping, compositing with 
pseudocapacitive materials, and by structure optimisation810. Novel electrode materials with 
performances onpar with or exceeding carbon materials have also been developed, including MXenes, 
metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), and transition metal oxides (TMOs)1113. Further research has 
focussed on developing new electrolytes with higher stable voltage windows and greater ionic 
conductivities1416.
