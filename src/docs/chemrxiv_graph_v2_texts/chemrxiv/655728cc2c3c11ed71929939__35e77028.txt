Description:
Involved in base pairing, a critical cell process.

Text:
Hydrogen bonds are essential to life as we know it, and the formation of hydrogen bond
networks is a key driver of structure in biochemistry,8 ubiquitous in critical cell processes
such as nucleotide base pairing9 and protein folding.10,11 However, the coarsegraining pro
cedure in Martini 3 places hydrogens together with heavy atoms into larger LennardJones
(LJ) particles and effectively averages out the energy contribution of directional hydrogen
bonding. In this work, we investigate whether the secondary and tertiary structure instabil
ity in Martini 3 proteins could originate from missing hydrogen bond energy.
