Description:
Chromophores housed within the apoprotein structure of phycobiliproteins, contributing to light absorbance.

6,7 Chromatic acclimation has recently been shown to occur in 40 of cyanobacteria 
across the globe, and is found in both freshwater and ocean environments.8,9 
The most commonly observed mechanism for chromatic acclimation used by 
cyanobacteria and red algae is the modification of the phycobilisome.2 Each phycobilisome is 
made up of two or more types of phycobiliproteins, each with a unique absorbance region resulting 
from the eight tetrapyrrole bilin chromophores housed within the apoprotein structure. Each type 
of phycobiliprotein contributes to the overall absorbance spectra of the phycobilisome and can 
therefore be used to control the resultant absorbance spectra used for light harvesting.
