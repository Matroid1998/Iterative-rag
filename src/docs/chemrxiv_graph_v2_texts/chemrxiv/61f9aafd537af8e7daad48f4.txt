Description:
Porous materials used in applications such as gas storage, separations, catalysis, and sensing.

Text:
Porous materials are employed in many applications, such as gas storage,1 separations,2
catalysis,3,4 and sensing.5,6 For many years, the porous materials research and development
community was dominated by activated carbons and zeolites, but over the last two decades
the eld has expanded grown enormously thanks to the discovery of porous metalorganic
frameworks (MOFs),7 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).810 In this work, we are
interested in the gas adsorption properties of MOFs crystalline frameworks constructed
from metal nodes and organic linkers.
