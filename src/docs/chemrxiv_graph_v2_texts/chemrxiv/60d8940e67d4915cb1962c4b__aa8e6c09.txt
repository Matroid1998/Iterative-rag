Description:
Involved in the development of luminescent materials.

Text:
In recent years, crystal engineering and construction of coordination networks with fascinating 
structural topologies have attracted great attention owing to their potential as functional 
materials.12 Concurrently, the development of multidimensional networks based primarily on 
linking metal centers with rigid bridging components, such as 4,4bipyridine has been initiated.33

Since then chemiluminescences of 3aminophthalhydrazide was first investigated by Albrecht,4 
the acyl hydrazides are growing interest in the development of luminescent materials due to their 
potential application in emissive devices.5 Moreover, the attractive and promising practical 
applications in many other areas have stimulated further investigations in lightemitting devices, 
nonlinear optics, and functional films,6 conjugated polymers,7 logic functions of molecular
scale,8 uranyl salts, saccharides, and aromatic organic molecular crystals which exhibit 
tribofluorescence or tribophosphorescence from the molecules comprising the crystal andor 
nitrogen emission triboluminescence,9 azopolymers.10 Metal directed assembly have been used to 
generate luminescent materials11 based on complexation of transition metal and multifunctional 
bridging ligands and is one of many useful strategies to design extended frameworks of various 
topology and dimensionality.
