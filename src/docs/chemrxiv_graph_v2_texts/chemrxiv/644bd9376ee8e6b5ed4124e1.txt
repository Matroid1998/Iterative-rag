However, 
the formation of MnO2 by electrochemical methods is a fast and easy process. There are a number of 
publications 19, 20, 21, where electrochemically deposited MnO2 was used as a catalyst, but the 
effect of the effect of the electrolytes, pH, electroplating technique and other conditions of film formation
