Description:
A feedstock structure for carbon nanoparticles studied for its relationship between surface structure and reactivity.

Text:
The surface chemistry of nanostructured carbon at high 
temperatures is of interest in numerous applications, 
including chars and soot in combustion, and carbon 
composites for hightemperature materials. From a 
fundamental perspective, carbon nanoparticle (NP) 
chemistry is interesting because NPs of different 
feedstock structures (graphite, diamond, etc.) can be 
studied to examine the relationship between surface 
structure and reactivity. For example, we have found 
that during O2 oxidative etching, different carbon NPs 
etch at different initial rates,1, 2 reflecting both the 
carbon NP feedstock structure and NPtoNP variations 
in surface structure for NPs from the same feedstock. Furthermore, under O2 etching conditions, all carbon 
NPs eventually evolved to become inert to further O2 
attack, and the kinetics of this transformation were 
complex, varying dramatically with feedstock, and from 
NPtoNP.

spherical, consisting of small graphene platelets bound 
together with amorphoushydrocarbon material, tending 
to become pure carbon in prolonged high temperature 
heating. Diamond NPs (Fig. 1c), have cores with 
diamond structure, but may have graphitic surface 
layers. Carbon nanoonions are synthesized by
