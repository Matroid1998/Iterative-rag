Description:
A target for reduction in catalytic processes to promote environmental sustainability.

Text:
The discovery of new catalysts for fundamental reactions such as water splitting, ammonia synthesis, or
CO2 reduction is a fundamental to the development of an environmentally sustainable economy. By
increasing reaction efficiency, catalysts offer the possibility of reducing industrial energy requirements and
enabling more sustainable chemical production processes 1. However, the space of all possible catalysts
is too vast to be surveyed experimentally 2. For this reason, the field of computational catalysis tries to
predict catalytic activity using materials properties. One important tool is the Sabatier principle, which
describes a volcanoshaped relationship between the binding energy of a key reaction specie and the
overall reaction rate 3.
