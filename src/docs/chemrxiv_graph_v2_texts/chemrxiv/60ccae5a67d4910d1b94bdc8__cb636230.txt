Description:
A layered transition metal oxide used as a cathode in lithium-ion batteries.

However, after three decades of commercial 
success of LIBs, the cathodes and anodes chemistries are rather similar to the ones 
commercialized in 1991 by Sony (LiCoO2  graphite), namely layered transition metal oxides (as 
LiNixMnyCozO2) cathodes and carbonbased anodes, respectively.1 Then, an alternative pathway 
to enhance LIBs performance, cost and CO2 footprint relies on optimizing composite electrodes, 
cells and battery packs manufacturing.1115 It has been estimated that the composite electrodes 
production alone account for 40 of the battery cells production cost, and, in between them, 
50 comes from slurry coating and solvent evaporation.16 In another study, Schnemann et al.17 
found that coating and drying represent the main cost of electrode and cell manufacturing, except 
for the cost of materials.
