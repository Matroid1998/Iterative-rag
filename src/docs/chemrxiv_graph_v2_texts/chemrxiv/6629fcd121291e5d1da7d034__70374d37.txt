Description:
Used as a crosslinker in the formation of porous networks from polystyrene.

The introduction of 
42 
covalent organic frameworks (COFs) addressed this issue and replaced coordinative through 
43 
covalent bonding.4,5 The additional transition from inorganic to entirely organic building blocks 
44 
extended the range of adjustable network properties and initiated the research field of porous 
45 
organic polymers (POPs).57 Herein, hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs) are a prominent class of 
46 
porous networks.8 HCPs already emerged in the early 1960s, where multitopic species were 
47 
incorporated into polymers to provide crosslinking between the propagating chains.9,10 Davankov 
48 
established the porous network formation out of swollen polystyrene with crosslinkers like bis
49 
chloromethylated derivatives of benzene or biphenyl, which are also capable to solely interconnect 
50 
with itself.1114 Based on these findings, Tans group transferred the crosslinking concept to 
51 
monomeric units and introduced a knitting strategy for diverse building blocks.15 In the knitting 
52 
reaction, rigid aromatic monomers are interconnected by an external crosslinker via FriedelCrafts
53 
alkylations or oxidative Scholl coupling in the presence of an acid.1618 The porosity of the
