Description:
An example of a carbide prepared via ALD.

Text:
This enables a 
fully surfacecontrolled deposition chemistry, enabling ALD to produce uniform thin films 
not only on planar substrates but also in complicated recessed features2. Although ALD can afford a conformal deposition, the lack of suitable carbon 
precursors makes ALD of carbides highly challenging. Some of the very few examples of 
carbides prepared via ALD include SiC36 and early transition metal carbides, e.g. WC7, 
NbC8, TiC9 and TaC10, which have been shown to be strong carbide formers11.
