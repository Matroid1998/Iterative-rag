Description:
A complex that reacts with CO2 to form a formate complex and releases CO2 upon removal of the CO2 atmosphere.

Text:
For example, Tanase and coworkers 
reported a hexacopper dihydride complex (Figure 1) which reacts 
to the corresponding formate complex at 1 atm of CO2, but which 
also releases the CO2 again upon removal of the CO2 atmosphere.10 
In addition, this complex is able to catalytically dehydrogenate 
formic acid (FA) selectively at only 45 C without additives (3.3 
mol Cu, TON 8.1 in 3 h). With triethylamine and tBuNC at 70 C, 
this activity can be increased (0.13 mol Cu, TON 720 in 3 h).
