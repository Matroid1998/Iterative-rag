Current supercapacitors under development for energy storage include various electrode 
39

materials ranging from metal oxides and carbon compounds such as graphene and carbon 
40

nanotubes to conductive polymers and their composite blends 57. Among polymer composites, 
41

typical electrode materials contain transition metal oxides such as MnO2, Fe2O3, NiO, Co2O3, CdO, 
42

and ZnO, and conductive polymers like polyaniline (PN), polypyrrole, and polyindole 810. 43

PN has been widely used for energy storage and conversion due to its good optical, electrical, 
44

electrochemical, and thermal properties 11. Due to the excellent material properties, polyindoles, 
45

particularly those incorporating transition metal oxides, are used in other technologies, too, such as 
46

fuel cells and photoelectrochemical water splitting  but the main application is in energy storage 
47

technologies.
