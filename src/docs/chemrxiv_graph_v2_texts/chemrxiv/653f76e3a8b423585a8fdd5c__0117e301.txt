Description:
A system used for supramolecular binding of metal complexes.

To synthesise ArMs, researchers have used many different approaches from simply 
leveraging native metalbinding activity found in certain proteins 14 to combining synthetic 
chemistry and proteins, including using variants of natural cofactors, such as the ironbinding 
protoporphyrin IX, with alternative transition metals 15,16. More synthetic approaches to site
specific incorporation of metal complexes include the utilisation of supramolecular binding, 
with several different tethered transition metal complex systems explored to date, the most 
notable being the biotinstreptavidin (Sav) system 17. Bioconjugation of metal complexes via 
covalent attachment with unique reactive amino acid residues such as cysteine or 
azidophenylalanine is another widely used approach to prepare ArMs18.
