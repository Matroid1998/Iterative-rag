Coupling partners generated from phenolic starting materials.

On the other hand, aryl fluorosulfates, 
first described more than four decades ago,19 have thus 
become increasingly popular as coupling partners, all the 
more so given the range of processes that now exist for 
their generation from phenolic starting materials (Scheme 
1). Hence, a new process that fulfills all of these criteria 
may represent a breakthrough in the common utilization 
of phenolbased electrophiles in crosscoupling research in 
modern synthetic chemistry.2026
