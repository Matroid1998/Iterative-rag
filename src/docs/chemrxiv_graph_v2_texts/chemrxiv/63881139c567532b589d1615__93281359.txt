Description:
Molecule that assembles into porous frameworks in the solid state.

Text:
Although long attributed to a competition be
tween dispersion interactions and quadrupolar electro
statics, the origin slipstacked  geometries (in ben
zene dimer, larger acene dimers, and in benzene on the
surface of graphene) has more recently been shown to
arise from a competition between dispersion and Pauli
repulsion, with electrostatics playing a negligible role in
driving oset stacking.912 (In larger acene dimers, elec
trostatics does play an important role in stabilizing cofa
cial geometries relative to Tshaped orientations.10)
The aim of the present work is to examine whether
these same conclusions hold for macrocycles that assem
ble into porous frameworks in the solid state. For ex
ample, the 18annulene molecule (Fig.
