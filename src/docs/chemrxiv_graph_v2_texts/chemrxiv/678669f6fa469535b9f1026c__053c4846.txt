Description:
Alloys with lithium to form structures that vary between hexagonal close-packed and body-centered cubic depending on lithium content.

In this 
63 
regard, alloying of AZseries Mg alloys with Li makes it possible to obtain lightweight alloys with 
64 
low density (density of ca. 1.3 gcm3) 79. The microstructure of binary Lirich Mg alloys 
65 
depends on the concentration of Li in the alloys 1012. At low lithium contents (below 5.7 wt. ), 
66 
the crystal structure of the formed alloys is a hexagonal closepacked (hcp) with the phase as a 
67 
solid solution of lithium in magnesium. At high lithium content (above 11.3 wt. ), the crystal 
68 
structure is bodycentered cubic (bcc) with the phase as a solid solution of magnesium in lithium. 69 
Magnesium alloys with a medium amount of Li have both hcp and bcc crystal structures 
70 
10,13,14.
