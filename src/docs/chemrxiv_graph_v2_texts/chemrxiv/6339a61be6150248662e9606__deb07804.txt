Description:
Used as a matrix in spectroscopic studies to observe absorption spectra.

Previous experiments in different media such as gas phase (n  113) 1820, 
solution (n  210, 12) 18,21, and neon matrix (n  612) 22 have observed the 
absorption spectra of several H(CC)nH chains and demonstrated their 
sizedependent electronic and optical characteristics. Also, there were some 
theoretical studies on the size dependence of the electronic excitation energies and 
oscillator strengths of the Hcapped carbon chains 23,24. But, perhaps limited by the 
analytical means at that time, almost all the reports were merely on location and 
assignment of the absorption band, and there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis 
of the sizedependent optical characteristics. Furthermore, it is of great theoretical and
