Description:
A nucleotide analogue effective in the treatment of COVID-19 by binding to RdRp and stopping viral replication.

Text:
Recently one such drug 
Remdesivir, which is a nucleotide analogue has proved effective in 
treatment of COVID19 in some clinical trials. Remdesivir binds to RdRp 
and 
stops 
viral 
replication 
thereby 
preventing 
replication 
and 
multiplication of virus inside host cells 6, 7, 8 . RdRp of SARS CoV2 has 
several nonstructured proteins like NSP12, NSP 7 and NSP8 9, 16. Remdesivir binds to active site residues located in NSP12 molecule of 
RdRp 10 . Earlier by docking studies we investigated several Remdesivir 
analogues that can be used as potential drug target in treatment of 
COVID19 11. In this study, we analyzed CHEMBL3120791 12 and performed 
Molecular dynamic simulations of protein drug complex using GROMACS 
13 .
