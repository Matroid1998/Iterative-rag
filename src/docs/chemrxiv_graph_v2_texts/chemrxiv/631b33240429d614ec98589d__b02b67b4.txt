In the converse piezoelec
tric effect, di,j  (iEj), an electrical field induces a
mechanical strain . Piezoelectric coefficients include the
longitudional and transverse coefficients, d33, d31, and
shear coefficients include d15, d24, d16, and the faceshear
mode d36, some of which are equivalent or vanish depend
ing on the crystal symmetry. The desired piezoelectric material properties depend
on the application. Highpower applications typically re
quire large dijs but are tolerant to frequency and temper
ature instability 13. Typical piezoelectric coefficients
for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) can exceed d33  600 pCN
14, 15. Low power applications, such as RF filters, on
the other hand, require stable coefficients as a function
of frequency. AlN, a material used for this purpose, has

a small but stable d33 of 3.4 pCN 16.

Stateoftheart
polymer piezoelectric materials, attractive for flexible de
vices such as energy harvesting cantilevers, are based on
the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The piezo
electric coefficient of PVDFcotrifluoroethylene(TrFE)
is d33  65.3 pCN 17, 18. Although piezoelectrics
like PZT, AlN, and PVDF have important commercial
applications, there remain a large parameter spaces be
tween these known materials where combinations of prop
erties, such as soft or flexible materials with robust or
stable piezoelectric responses, are yet to be found. Plastic ionic molecular crystals, which consist of inor
ganic anions bonded to organic cations, are an emerg
ing class of ferroelectric and piezoelectrics that could fill
many gaps in the material property space 1922.
