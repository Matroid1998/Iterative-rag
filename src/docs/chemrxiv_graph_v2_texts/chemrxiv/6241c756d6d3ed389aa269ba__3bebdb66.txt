Description:
Coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues in a cross-braced fashion.

Text:
Over 170 sequences 
have been annotated as PHD fingers in the human genome.3 They contain conserved regions of 
cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two Zn2 ions in a cross braced fashion, with an 
antiparallel twostranded sheet core, which imposes conformational stability.37 These domains 
read a range of histone marks, notably the methylation state of the K4 residue of H3 histone 
(H3K4Me3, H3K4Me2 or H3K4Me0), and the H3K9 and H3R2 positions.8,9 Mutations within this 
motif have been linked to immunological, neurological and developmental disorders.10,11
