Description:
A leaching agent with measurable efficiency.

Text:
The leaching
efficiencies were in the order of (NH4)2SO4  NH4Cl  K2SO4  KNO3  KCl  Na2SO4  NaCl 
NaNO3, and Yang Lifen3reported that at an equivalent concentration of 0.128 N, the leaching
efficiencies of the following leaching agents in the following order Al2(SO4)3  (NH4)2SO4  AlCl3 
Al(NO3)3  NH4NO3  NH4Cl  MgSO4  Mg(NO3)2  CaCl2  Ca(NO3)2  MgCl2, and Xiao Yanfei4
et al reported that at a leaching agent concentration of 0.1 molL pH  2, the leaching efficiency of
Fe2(SO4)3  FeSO4  MgSO4  ZnSO4  Fe(NO3)2  FeCl2  MnSO4  Mg(NO3)2  MgCl2  K2SO4
