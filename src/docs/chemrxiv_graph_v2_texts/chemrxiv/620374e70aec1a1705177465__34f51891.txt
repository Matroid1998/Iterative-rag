Description:
Deposits high quality films with precise thickness, controlled composition, low impurity contents, and excellent conformality on complex substrates.

ALD of In2O3 is especially interesting as 
it can deposit high quality films with precise thickness, controlled composition, low 
impurity contents, and excellent conformality on complex substrates has been 
demonstrated.10

ALD of In2O3 was first reported using InCl3 and either H2O or H2O2 at temperatures 
between 300500 C.11 The low vapor pressure of InCl3, the generation of HCl as the 
reaction byproduct and the possibility for InCl3 to etch the growing In2O3 layer12 has 
motivated the use of other In precursors. Furthermore, there has been limitations on 
availability of efficient indium precursors that give processes with high growth rates, fully 
selflimiting reactions, low impurity contents and good film crystallinity.
