Description:
Alloyed with tin to improve mechanical strength in the Bronze age.

Alloys are disordered solid solutions of two or more materials
(metals or insulators), which could be iso or heterostructural. Such solid solutions may span the entire composition range (com
plete solid solutions) or may form in limited composition ranges
with miscibility gap(s). Alloying has been utilized to design ma
terials with superior structural and functional properties since
time immemorial. From alloying copper with tin to improve
the mechanical strength of tools and weaponry in the Bronze
age to alloying of iron to produce steel during the Industrial
Revolution, alloy design and optimization has become the cor
nerstone of human advancement. More recently, InxGa1xN al
loys have enabled tunable light emitting diodes, wherein the
band gap of GaN is tuned by controlling the In content1.
