Description:
Forms vacancies on the TiO2 surface that play a pivotal role in catalytic processes.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has emerged as a critical support material for catalysts due 
to its exceptional physical and chemical properties, including high stability, tunable 
electronic characteristics, and the capacity to form oxygen vacancies1. These oxygen 
vacancies, particularly on the TiO2 surface, play a pivotal role in catalytic processes 
by enhancing reactivity and enabling TiO2 to act as a reducible oxide support2. Manipulating these vacancies is crucial in catalytic applications such as CO2 activation 
and reduction within the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction and 
(de)hydrogenation reactions, where modifying surface structures can significantly 
improve catalytic performance35. Among the different phases of TiO2, the rutile form has been extensively studied, 
especially under reductive conditions, where surface reconstructions occur.
