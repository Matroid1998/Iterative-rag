Description:
A substrate that is converted to prephenate by the enzyme chorismate mutase.

Text:
In this work, we explore
the enzyme chorismate mutase in conjunction with a proofofconcept expansion of RINRUS
capabilities interfacing QMcluster modeling with Molecular Dynamics (MD) techniques. Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the reaction of chorismate to prephenate, participat
