Description:
A gas that can be reduced into value-added products to produce synthetic fuels or commodity synthetic hydrocarbon molecules.

Renewable energy is increasingly abundant and future investment will allow it to meet the growing energy 
36 
demand in the world14. A critical component for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is converting 
37 
electrical power obtained from renewable sources into synthetic fuels that can be used in transportation 
38 
or stored to be used ondemand5,6. Reducing CO2 into valueadded products would produce synthetic 
39 
fuels or commodity synthetic hydrocarbon molecules, while simultaneously contributing to reduce 
40 
atmospheric CO2 through carbon capture and utilization 79. 41 
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2 ER) is an efficient and clean process to convert CO2 into liquid fuels 
42 
and other reduced carbonbased compounds 913.

Description:
Can be hydrogenated or used in electroreduction processes under ambient conditions.

In contrast with conventional commercial methods, 
43 
such as CO2 hydrogenation or the FisherTropsch processes, CO2 ER can be conducted under ambient 
44 
temperatures and pressures using modular, scalable and decentralized units14. Copperbased catalysts are 
45 
the most selective materials known to unlock CO2 ER towards C2 compounds, such as ethanol and 
46 
ethylene10,1517 and other multicarbon hydrocarbons. And compared to other metal catalysts, copper 
47 
exhibits a relatively lower selectivity towards hydrogen evolution, leading to unmatched Faradaic 
48 
efficiencies for CO2 ER18. 49 
In the last two decades, numerous studies1921 attempted to optimize the catalytic activity, the energy 
50 
efficiency, and the selectivity of copper.
