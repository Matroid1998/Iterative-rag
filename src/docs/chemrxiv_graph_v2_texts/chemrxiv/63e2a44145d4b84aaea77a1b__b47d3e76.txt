Description:
Materials with a structure comprising a transition metal layer sandwiched between two chalcogen layers.

Twodimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lay
ers are among the most widely studied materials for potential applica
tions in electronic devices 18. The interest stems from the intrinsic
properties of TMDs, which arise due to their characteristic structure. Each TMD sheet comprises one transitionmetal layer (Mo, W, Pt, etc.) sandwiched between two chalcogen layers (S, Se, Te). The elements
within these three layers bond covalently, adopting either trigonal pris
matic (1H, 2H for multilayer) or octahedral symmetry (1T), leaving no
coordinatively unsaturated surface sites. Consequently, the basal planes
of TMD are often chemically inactive, with external interactions lim
ited to van der Waals (vdW) forces.
