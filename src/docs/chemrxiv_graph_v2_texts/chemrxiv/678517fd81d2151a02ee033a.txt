Description:
A compound that marked the birth of organometallic chemistry and is known for its unmatched redox chemistry.

Text:
The synthesis and characterization of ferrocene (Fc) in 1951 has been widely marked as the 
birth of organometallic chemistry, sparking the rich chemistry of metallocenes.1 Besides many 
prosperous applications ranging from medicinal chemistry,2 battery design,3 atomic sensors4 
to catalysis5, a defining feature of metallocenes is their unmatched redox chemistry, with the 
one electron oxidation of ferrocene to ferrocenium serving as standard reference for non
aqueous electrochemical processes.6 Considering that transition metal metallocenes usually
