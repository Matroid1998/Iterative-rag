Description:
Species produced from cysteine and acyl thioesters.

Text:
Interestingly, it was also observed that the remaining thiol group of the diacylated product can 
further react with additional thioesters to generate phospholipids containing three alkyl chains. Inspired by these findings, 
we hypothesized that cysteine itself may undergo NCL in the presence of acyl thioesters followed by substrate reloading, 
leading to the production of diacylcysteine species. Both cysteine and shortchain thioesters have been shown to be 
synthesized by prebiotically plausible routes, and both can be produced in abundance, the latter through derivatization 
of shortchain fatty acids (24, 25 . Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the significance of cysteine in prebiotic 
metabolism, for instance as a catalyst for peptide bond formation (24 .

Description:
Forms protocells facilitated by silica substrates, indicating potential for structural diversity.

Text:
We find that the formation of diacylcysteine protocells was facilitated by silica 
substrates, supporting previous models of primordial membrane assembly (26 . We propose a simple electrostatic 
mechanism for substratetemplated membrane formation and describe several experiments that support our hypothesis. Unlike fatty acids, and even phospholipids, the head group of the lipid can be varied dramatically by diacylation of N
terminal Cyscontaining peptides. This suggests the potential for significant structural diversity and functionality in
