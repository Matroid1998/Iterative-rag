Description:
An ideal fuel additive, promising hydrogen carrier, and versatile building block in chemical synthesis.

Text:
Syngas (COH2) serves as a crucial platform for transforming the nonpetroleum carbon 
resources, such as coal, natural gas, shale gas and biomass, into liquid fuels and basic chemicals. 13 In that context, major efforts have focused on the direct conversion of syngas into ethanol, 
an ideal fuel additive, promising hydrogen carrier, and versatile buildingblock in chemical 
synthesis.48 Among potential candidates, Rhbased catalysts show promising ethanol 
selectivity in syngas conversion in the presence of specific additives, socalled promoters.912 
Among them, Fe has been shown to be particularly efficient to trigger ethanol production of 
Rhbased catalysts.9, 1317 However, the promotional effect of Fe under syngas conversion 
conditions remains poorly understood, partly because of the illdefined catalyst structures 
resulting from conventional synthetic approaches.

Description:
A compound involved in synthesis debates regarding its promotion by RhFe alloy or RhFeOx interfaces.

Text:
For example, there are ongoing debates 
regarding whether the RhFe alloy or RhFeOx interfaces are crucial for promoting ethanol 
synthesis.13, 14, 16, 17 
In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) has emerged as a powerful 
synthetic methodology to generate tailored catalysts and to interrogate the role of composition 
and interfaces.1820 Specifically, SOMC exploits the surface termination of oxide supports, 
especially surface OH groups, MSOH, to anchor welldefined metal precursors, LnMXx 
through protonolysis, generating atomically dispersed surface species, MSOMLnXx1 (ca. 1 
sitenm2) while releasing HX. Subsequent thermal treatment under vacuum or reactive 
atmospheres like H2 can yield isolated metal sites or nanoparticles with tailored compositions 
or interfaces. Overall, SOMC generates welldefined models of heterogeneous catalysts, where 
each component can be selectively introduced and their state probed through detailed 
characterization.
