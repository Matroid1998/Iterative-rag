Description:
Studied for its band structures and optical properties.

Text:
(2015) 21 performed a comprehensive study on the band structures and
optical properties of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 using GGA functionals and found that
GGA fails to reproduce the experimentally observed bandgaps accurately. They also noted the
