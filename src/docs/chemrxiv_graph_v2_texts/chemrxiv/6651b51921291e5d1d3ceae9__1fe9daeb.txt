Description:
An atom in the acyl pyridinium intermediate involved in molecular dynamics simulations.

Text:
The acyl pyridinium intermediate derived from DSH reacted 
only with nearby Lys residues.8 The molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation indicates that the distance between the acyl carbon 
atom of the acyl pyridinium intermediate and the Nterminal
