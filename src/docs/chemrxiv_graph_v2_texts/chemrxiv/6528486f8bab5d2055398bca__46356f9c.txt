Description:
Relieves a smaller proportion of angle strain (50) upon ring opening.

Stirling et al.13 
proposed that cyclopropane relieves a larger proportion of angle strain (75) than cyclobutane 
(50) upon ringopening, while the groups of Hoz14 and Houk15 argued that differences in 
electronic structure (i.e., bonding) are instead the cause of the reactivity difference. Hoz proposed
