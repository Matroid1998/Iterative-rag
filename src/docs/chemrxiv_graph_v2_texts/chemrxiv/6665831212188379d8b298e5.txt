Description:
Central metal element in MX6 type complexes, important for ligand field splitting.

Text:
MX6type complexes, where M is a central metal el
ement and X is a ligand, serve as excellent models for
introducing ligand field splitting  an essential factor
in predicting the electronic and spin states of transition
metal complexes. This subject is frequently discussed in
inorganic chemistry books 13. While some MX6 com
plexes exhibit the expected Oh symmetry based on their
molecular formula, the JahnTeller (JT) effect 4, 5 can
induce distortions that lead to another molecular struc
ture such as D4h symmetry. The smallest and most ex
tensively reported MX6 complexes would be MF6.
