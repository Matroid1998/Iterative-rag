Description:
Found in acidic crude oils, especially bituminous oils, and associated with the formation of stable emulsions.

Text:
Naphthenic acids (NA) are found in acidic crude oils, especially bituminous oils. The presence of 
these naphthenic acids in bitumen has been associated with the formation of stable emulsions that 
are difficult to separate 1,2. This connection between emulsion stability and the presence of NA in 
bituminous acidic oils has spurred research into the interfacial activity and partition behavior of 
NA. Recent studies have revisited the partitioning of NA in oilwater systems36. Bertheussen et 
al.7 reviewed how pH, molecular structure and size affected the partitioning of organic acids and 
bases between oil and water.
