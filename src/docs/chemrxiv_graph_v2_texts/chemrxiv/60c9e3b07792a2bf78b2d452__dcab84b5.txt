Description:
Forms topological structures with soft transition metal ions.

On other hand, the known donor properties of nitrogen in a variety of ligand structures, 
little has been reported concerning the potential ligand properties of oxime ethers12. Oxime 
ethers are stable and are relatively simple to synthesize and thus it was of interest to us to explore 
their ligand properties. PRESENT WORK 
In a continuation of our research in the design of multidentate heteroaromatic ligands1318, 
benzyloxyiminoacetic acid19, 1,3Dithialanemethanol20 and sulfur ethers21 are successfully 
formed topological structure with soft transition metals ion. Encouraged by these results, we 
synthesize and characterize of new aromatic derivatives containing the 1,3dithiolane and 
benzyloximate moiety.
