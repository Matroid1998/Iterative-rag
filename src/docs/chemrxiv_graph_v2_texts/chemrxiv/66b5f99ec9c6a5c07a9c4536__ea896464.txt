Description:
Ions that offer higher ionic mobility in the electrolyte, leading to faster reaction kinetics.

Text:
Recently, there has been growing interest in rechargeable batteries based on an anion 
shuttle, such as chloride or fluoride batteries that operate at room temperature.4 CIBs show 
significant potential as future power sources due to their high theoretical energy density (2500 
Wh L1).5 Despite their larger ionic radius compared to Li, Mg, O2 and F, Cl ions offer 
higher ionic mobility in the electrolyte, which could lead to faster reaction kinetics. A typical 
CIB is composed of a metal chloride electrode that supplies chloride ions, an electrolyte for
