Description:
Used in the Reverse Water Gas Shift reaction, preferably green hydrogen.

Text:
However, these phenomena have only been investigated from the perspective of
Surface Science, without considering farther the implications of the observed changes on the
reactivity of the catalyst.3,5,13
Among the reactions that generate CO, the Reverse Water GasShift (RWGS; Equation
1), that recycles CO2 and uses (preferentially green) hydrogen is receiving considerable
attention of late as it can effectively balance industrial feeds.9,1416 The process is endothermic
(H042 kJ mol1; S42 J mol1 K1)14,15,1721 and, under lower temperatures, methane
becomes the main product (H0165 kJ mol1, Equation 2). This reduces the process
efficiency,14,17 and decreases the yield of other possible minor byproducts such as methanol,22
Equation 3.

Description:
Referred to as green hydrogen when used in the Fischer-Tropsch process to generate synthetic fuels.

Text:
The suppression of methanation is desirable from an industrial point of view
since CO and green hydrogen can be employed further in the FischerTropsch process to
generate synthetic fuels,18,22 as an example. 3
