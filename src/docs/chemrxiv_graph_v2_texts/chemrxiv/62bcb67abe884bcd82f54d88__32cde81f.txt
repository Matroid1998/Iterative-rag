Description:
Involved in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) yielding valuable green fuels or base chemicals.

In such systems, photoabsorbers can 
generate the required photovoltage, while catalysts decrease the 
overpotential of the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction 
(OER, HER) for overall water splitting.3 
The maximum photon flux from solar irradiation limits the current 
density to 10 mA cm2 on a flat substrate with an electrode area 
equal to its photoabsorber size.2,4 For low current densities, 
cheap and earth abundant metalnitrogencarbon (MNC; M  Mn, 
Fe, Co, Ni, Mo) catalysts hold promise to replace platinumtype 
catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).5 MNC 
catalysts are better known for their excellent activity in the oxygen 
reduction reaction (ORR).6 They are also attractive for the CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR) yielding valuable green fuels or base 
chemicals.5c,7 One notable property of these materials is that the 
selectivity of the reduction process can be manipulated by varying 
the nature of the metal center or its chemical environment.5b,7c,8 
Almost all MNC catalysts are prepared via a high temperature 
pyrolysis which results in a material with varying degrees of 
structural disorder.
