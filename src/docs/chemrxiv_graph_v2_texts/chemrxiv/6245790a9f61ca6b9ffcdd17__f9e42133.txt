Description:
Catalyzes O-aryl ester bond formation reactions.

Text:
Although anal
ogous Oaryl ester bond formation reactions catalyzed by 
palladium have been reported, these protocols are far from 
mild and efficient, and are relying on stoichiometric 
amounts of silver salts.11,12 Mechanistically, nickelcatalyzed 
Cheteroatom bond formations under thermal conditions 
were proposed to proceed via a selfsustained NiINiIII cata
lytic cycle.10 In addition, the relevance of this catalytic mech
anism was also demonstrated under photochemical1317 and 
electrochemical14 reaction conditions. From these catalytic 
studies it became apparent that in order to successfully en
gage a selfsustained NiINiIII catalytic cycle the continuous 
reduction of NiII to NiI is required, as NiI is prone to deacti
vation via an exergonic comproportionation reaction with 
NiIII forming inactive NiII.
