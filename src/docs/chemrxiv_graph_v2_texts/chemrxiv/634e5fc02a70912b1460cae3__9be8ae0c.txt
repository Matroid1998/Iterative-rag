Description:
Polycrystalline copper used as a metal catalyst for the production of multicarbon products.

The distribution of major
products on bare, polycrystalline Cu can be seen in the inset to Figure 1. Increasing the selectivity and activity for the production of these multicarbon products contin
ues to be a challenge.1416 Great efforts have been done in controlling the crystal facets,1719 the
morphology,20 the grain boundaries,21 or the oxidation state22 to increase the selectivity of spe
cic products. An approach which has gained a lot of interest in recent years is to functionalize the
metal catalyst surface with molecules, whether by coating the surface with a polymer or by an or
ganic additive adsorbing to the surface. We here consider both ways of modifying the surface (what
