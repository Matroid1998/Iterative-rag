Description:
A compound that can be valorized to small molecules and monomers.

In case of descrip
tors the main requirements are low computational cost,
distinguishability between similar structures and ability to
encode both spatial and information, electronic structure
and composition. Graphbased neural network architectures
found to be eective across large molecular and materials
datasets due to substatial number of learnable parameters,
while descriptorbased approaches are
One of the main applications of such models is a discov
ery and optimization of both heterogeneous 9 and homoge
neous catalysts 5. Novel catalysts can solve many environ
mental and energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis,
moving to more atomeconomic processes and valorization of
atmospheric CO2 to small molecules and monomers.

Description:
A compound that can be valorized through electrochemical reduction to prevent emissions.

Text:
Compared to photochemical and thermal processes electro
chemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) found to be one of several
promising strategies to valorize CO2 and prevent emissions. Electrochemical reactions usually operate at mild temper
atures and pressure. They can be tuned to selective prod
