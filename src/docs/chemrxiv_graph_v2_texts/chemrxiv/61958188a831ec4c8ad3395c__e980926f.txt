Bi(III) 
shares the same electronic configuration (Xe 4f14 5d10 6s2) with Pb(II), and shows excellent potential 
as a Pb alternative it has low toxicity, and complex bismuth halides are characterised by good air 
stability.610 Bi(III) cannot fit into the ABX3 perovskite structure, but instead forms a series of structures 
with distorted BiX6 corneroredgeshared octahedra, leading to halide perovskite derivatives, A3Bi2X9 
which adopt either 0D, 1D or 2D inorganic sublattices.1114 The 2D layered structure is of special 
interest due to its vibronic properties and electronic strucutre,15, 16 and remarkable luminescent 
efficiencies.14 The 2D structure is formed when X is bromide ion, while when X is iodide, the material
