Description:
An aromatic compound where an electrondonating group at the 6-position improves nucleophilicity.

Text:
of an electrondonating 
group at the 6position of benzothiophene would improve 
nucleophilicity at the position and that the Lewis acid would 
react at the C2position (see Figure 1C). To this end, the reaction 
with 3a bearing a methoxy group at the 6position successfully 
yielded 31 of C3anisylbenzothiophene 4a as expected, and 
49 of 3a was recovered (Entry 1). Table 2. Screening of reaction conditions. a
