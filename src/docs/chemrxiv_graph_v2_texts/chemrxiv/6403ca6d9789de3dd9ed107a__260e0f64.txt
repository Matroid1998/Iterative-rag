Description:
Structurally consists of a pyrrole fused to a pyridine ring.

Text:
Structurally, the indolizine moiety consists in a pyrrole fused to a pyridine ring. They are 
known for their bioactivities and also by some photophysical properties.5 Indolizine
containing compounds have be found in a plethora of natural products from animal and 
plant sources.6 To date, only a handful of reports on the nucleophilic addition of 
indolizines to pQMs have been published.7 In 2016, Yao, Lin, and coworkers reported 
a single example of BF3OEt2promoted C3alkylation of a 1substituted indolizine with 
pQM (Scheme 1a).7a Later, in 2020, Zhang et al.
