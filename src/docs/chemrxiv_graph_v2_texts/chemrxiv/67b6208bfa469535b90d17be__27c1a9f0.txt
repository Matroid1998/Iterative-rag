Description:
Nanoparticles that are more active than Raney Ni and used in catalytic conversions.

Text:
In another attempt, a catalyst comprised of 3.7 nm 
Ni nanoparticles dispersed on silica, though more active than Raney Ni, required 90 C because formation 
of aniline only begins when the conversion of the strongly adsorbed nitrosobenzene intermediate is higher 
than 90.7 
In the following, we describe the high and stable activity in the NB reduction to aniline of the reduced form 
(RGONi) of NiGraf, a newly developed metal organic alloy (MORAL) comprised of graphene oxide en
trapped within Ni nanoparticles (GONi).8 Actually consisting of Ni nanoparticles encapsulating GO plate
lets,9 this new class of Nibased catalysts is reproducibly and efficiently obtained through the MORAL 
approach first introduced by Avnir in 2002.10 Since then, widely different molecularly doped metals were 
applied as enhanced catalysts to numerous catalytic conversions.11 Yet, their uptake in catalysis science 
and technology in the subsequent two decades remained surprisingly low, even though metal species
