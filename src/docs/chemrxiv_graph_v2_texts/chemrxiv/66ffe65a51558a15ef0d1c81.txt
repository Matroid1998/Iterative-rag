Description:
A domain used for directional transport of molecules across phases.

Text:
In this work, we demonstrate the transport of molecules from an 
aqueous sender phase to an aqueous receiver phase across a centi
metersized chloroform domain (Fig. 1B, C). The transport takes 
place directionally and against a concentration gradient. The non
equilibrium process operates by transducing highchemicalpoten
tial fuel in the sender phase into a waste molecule with low chemical 
potential. Notably, we achieve active and directed transport without 
complex machinery but simply by transiently changing the partition
ing coefficient of the transporter molecule by a carbodiimidedriven 
chemical reaction cycle. Despite relatively poor fuel efficiency, repet
itive fueling fills the receiver phase while the sender phase empties.
