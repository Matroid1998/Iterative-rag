Description:
A phosphodiester-linked trimer constructed in a symmetrical building-outwards strategy.

This provides 
an opportunity to develop polymers in which informationrich 
sequences control their resultant nanostructures, creating 
synthetic, bioorthogonal analogues to DNA hybridisation, which 
could be used in nanoelectronics or light harvesting. Scheme 1. Synthesis of phosphodiester trimers DAN3, NDI3, DAN
NDIDAN, and NDIDANNDI. Results and Discussion 
DAN and NDIcontaining phosphodiesterlinked trimers were 
constructed in a symmetrical buildingoutwards strategy, in four 
sequences  DAN3, NDI3, DANNDIDAN, and NDIDANNDI 
(Scheme 1). Monomers were constructed by attaching short 
spacers at either end of the aromatic units, terminated in
