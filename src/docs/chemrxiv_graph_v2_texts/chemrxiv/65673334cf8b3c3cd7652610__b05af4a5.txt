Description:
Utilized in substitution chemistry for the synthesis of certain compounds.

Text:
This is perhaps due to the requirement of activated nitrogen 
species (bearing electronwithdrawing groups) used in these 
methodologies, 
such 
as 
nitrenes.1a 
Despite 
extensive 
development, few examples of heterocyclic aziridines have 
been reported using transition metal catalysis,8 electrochemical9 
or flow electrochemical approaches,10 organocatalysis,11 or 
utilising substitution chemistry with sulfur ylides or imines.12
