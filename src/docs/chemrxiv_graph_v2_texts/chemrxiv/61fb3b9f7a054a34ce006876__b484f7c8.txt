Description:
Widely accepted as precursors for soot, involved in physical and chemical nucleation processes.

Text:
Soot emitted from human activities leads to 
respiratory diseases and global warming 1. A 
significant number of studies are ongoing to understand 
the mechanisms responsible for soot formation, which 
involves precursor chemistry, particle nucleation, and 
masssize growth 2,3. The critical stage of soot 
formation is the inception process, in which gasphase 
aromatics form condensed clusters, resulting in 
carbonaceous nanoparticles. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are 
widely accepted as precursors for soot. Two major 
pathways of soot nucleation initiated from PAHs 2,4 
are known, namely, physical nucleation of PAHs into 
stacked clusters 5,6 and chemical nucleation of PAHs 
into an aromatic network via crosslinking reactions 
79.
