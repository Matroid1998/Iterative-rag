Description:
A dietary element incorporated into important metalloenzymes such as MnSOD.

Text:
Drinking water is a major source of environmental exposure. In the developed 
world, most people in urban and suburban regions receive a managed and treated 
water supply, with those in rural areas often relying on wells to access groundwater. Contamination of water sources by heavy metals presents a threat to health, and hence 
metal concentrations in groundwater and treated water sources are assessed for their 
compliance with existing regulations. While some metals such as arsenic, cadmium, 
and lead are widely understood to be toxic and hence are strictly regulated, other 
metals are considered to be safe even when concentrations exceed the ppb range. Manganese (Mn) is a dietary element, incorporated into important metalloenzymes such 
as MnSOD.

Description:
The EPA has no standard limit on manganese in drinking water, with an advisory limit at 300 Âµg/L.

Text:
The recommended dietary allowance is about 2 mgday, which is readily 
achieved through food such that deficiencies in humans have not been reported. Typical 
blood concentrations range from 4 to 15 g L1. On the basis of this evidence, the EPA 
has no standard limit on manganese in drinking water, with the advisory limit at 300 g 
L1 (300 ppb or 5.5 M). Thousands of wells in the U.S have been found to be 
contaminated with Mn2 concentrations exceeding this generous limit 13. There is 
currently no known biological requirement for vanadium (V) in humans.
