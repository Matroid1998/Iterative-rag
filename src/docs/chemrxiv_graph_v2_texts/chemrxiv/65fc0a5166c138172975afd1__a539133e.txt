Description:
The lightest metal engineering materials used in ultralight and superplastic structural materials.

Alloying with aluminum makes it possible to increase the 
65 
strength, hardness, casting properties, and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys 2,14. The 
66 
microstructure of such alloys is a solid solution of aluminum and phase (Mg17Al12) in Mg, the 
67 
presence of which increases the corrosion potential and reduces its corrosion rate. 68 
Continuous technological development and search for new energysaving technologies 
69 
have promoted further development of ultralight and superplastic structural materials 15,16. 70 
Among them, magnesiumlithium (MgLi) alloys are the lightest metal engineering materials 
71 
16,17.
