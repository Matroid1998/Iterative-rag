Description:
A hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite with tunable compositions and structures.

Hybrid organicinorganic lead halide perovskites (i.e., methylammonium lead trihalide, 
CH3NH3PbX3 also known as MAPbX3, where MA  methylammonium or CH3NH3, and X  Cl, 
Br, or I) have garnered significant attention involving electronic, optoelectronic, laser, light
emitting diode, photodetector, and Xrayray detector device technologies.18 This is largely due 
to tunable processdependent compositions, structures, and morphologies resulting in a wide range 
of material characteristics, such as changes in the bandgap, carrier mobility, and exciton binding 
energy.9 Additionally, the potential for adaptable lowcost manufacturing (compared to stateof
theart commercial technologies) make perovskites appealing for highproduction throughput and 
scaleup manufacturing advancements.
