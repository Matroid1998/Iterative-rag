Used in batteries and forms salts with polyethylene oxide.

Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have the potential to replace small molecule solvent electrolytes 
in lithium batteries due to their superior safety and processability features.1, 2 To this end, polyethylene 
oxide (PEO) based materials are the most extensively studied and optimized SPEs to date on account 
of their wide availability, great solubility towards lithium salts, and good mechanical properties.3 
However, the ionic conductivity of PEObased SPEs at room temperature is still 3 orders of magnitude 
lower than the commonly used solvent electrolytes based on organic carbonates, which limits their 
largescale applications.4, 5 The main problem causing PEObased SPEs low ionic conductivity is their 
tendency to form large crystalline domains with the presence of lithium cation at room temperature.6 
Such crystalline domains significantly slow down the chain dynamics of PEOs and reduce the rate of 
lithium transport.7 
Over the past decades, there have been a number of attempts aiming at reducing the crystallinity 
of PEObased SPEs and enhancing their ionic conductivity at room temperature.810 Among these 
examples, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as plasticizers has been recognized as an effective method.
