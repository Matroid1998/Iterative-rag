Description:
A molecule where the protons are in a singlet spin state with vanishing total spin.

For the majority of practical 
applications the preferred option is PHIP transfer from protons to lowgamma nuclei (13C, 15N, and others) 
912 since they are less prone to polarization losses since their relaxation is significantly slower compared 
to protons, and since one can record backgroundfree NMR and MRI signals. NMR signal enhancement in PHIP arises from the nonequilibrium populations of proton spin states in 
parahydrogen (pH2), i.e., dihydrogen where the protons are in a singlet spin state with vanishing total 
spin. The two most popular PHIP approaches today are hydrogenative PHIP and Signal Amplification by 
Reversible Exchange (SABRE).
