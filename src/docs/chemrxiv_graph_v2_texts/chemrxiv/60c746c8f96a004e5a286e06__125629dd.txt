Description:
Material used to make capillaries for nanopipettes with orifice diameters ranging from micrometers to nanometers.

As a subgroup of solidstate nanopores, the glass 
nanopipette is modeled as a costeffective and versatile source of conical shaped 
nanopore and has been used for single DNA, protein, and nanoparticle (NP) analysis.18
22 Compared with other solidstate nanopores, the advantages of the nanopipette are 
obvious, for it can be facilely obtained from pulling the glass or quartz capillaries with 
orifice diameters ranging from micrometers to nanometers.18, 23, 24 Owing to the unique 
tip nanoarchitecture, the nanopipette is envisioned as a powerful means for integrated 
study and manipulation of chemical and biological sensing and electrophysiological 
applications.2527 Herein, the glass nanopipette tip structure was reconstructed through 
uptodown approach by filled the very tip of the glass nanopipette with mesoporous 
carbon, which was subdivided and formed differential structure.
