Description:
An electrolyte used in previous reports with durability up to 300-400 cycles.

Since the XPS analyzes the top surface layer of the 
sample and XRD delivers the much deeper measurement, we infer that the CuO only exists in the top 
surface layer, which elucidates that the metallic Cu dominates the electrodeposition process and results 
in low emissivity. For practical applications as the building envelope, the electrochromic device must have longterm 
durability. Figures 2d and e show the cycle test of the midIR emissivity tuning. The large emissivity 
contrast can be maintained for 1000 cycles and only degrade 21 after 1800 cycles, which exhibits a 
significant improvement from the previous reports using AgDMSO electrolyte (only up to 300400 
cycles). (40, 52) The emissivity spectra maintain their broadband feature after 2500 cycles (Figure 2e).
