Description:
Cations that act as ChB anion receptors and transporters.

Text:
For 
example, Gabbai and coworkers have recently reported 
the notable increased potency of Te(IV) cations as ChB 
anion receptors and transporters in comparison to their 
parent, neutral Te(II) analogues (Figure 1).26 This was 
achieved by the oxidative methylation of diaryltellurides, a 
powerful, but irreversible, means of tuning the ChB donor 
properties. Conceivably, control of local ChB donor potency could also 
be achieved by coupling of a chalcogen centre to a redox
active moiety, wherein oxidation or reduction reversibly 
switchesON or OFF chalcogen centred electrophilicity.
