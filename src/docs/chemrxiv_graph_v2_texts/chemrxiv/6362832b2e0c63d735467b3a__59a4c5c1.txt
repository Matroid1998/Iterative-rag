Description:
A photovoltaic device with a modest efficiency of 3%.

Text:
Cs2SnI6 was originally used as a holetransporting layer
in dyesensitized solar cells, for instance, achieving efficiencies of 8 ,16 while a Cs2TiBr6
photovoltaic device demonstrated a modest efficiency of 3 .14 The poor performance of
