Description:
Compounds involved in functionalization reactions.

37 , 38 , 39 , 40 Based on reports 
concerning the functionalization of Zincke imines,41,42,43,44,45 and 
our studies on photochemical amination of dienol ethers, we 
hypothesized that selective C3amination of pyridines could be 
achieved in a photocatalytic manner. Indeed, we demonstrate 
that Ncentered radicals, generated from Naminopyridinum 
salts in a photochemical manner, react with Zincke imine to 
regioselectively produce, after rearomatization, C3amino 
pyridines.
