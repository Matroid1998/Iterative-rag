Description:
A semiconducting material used for PEC water splitting.

Text:
Over the past few 
decades, various semiconducting materials have been reported for PEC water splitting, such as 
silicon (Si),4 cadmium telluride (CdTe),5 copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS),6 Cubased 
chalcogenides,7 cuprous oxide (Cu2O),8 bismuth vanadate (BiVO4),9 and hematite (
Fe2O3).10 Nonetheless, challenges such as the complex fabrication process of Si, the scarcity 
of In and Te, the toxicity of Cd, and the poor stability of Cu2O for the abovementioned materials 
have severely restricted largescale commercialization. The development of highefficiency, 
lowcost, and stable semiconducting materials used in PEC systems plays a crucial role in 
meeting the entire societys energy demand.
