A fluorophore used in various clinical settings.

The success of 
indocyanine green (ICG) in various clinical settings ex
emplifies the potential of this fluorophore family.2 Fur
thermore, the recent FDA approval of OTL38, a folate 
receptortargeted heptamethine conjugate, underscores 
the growing impact of these dyes in clinical translation.3,4 
Moreover, by strategically incorporating specific hetero
cycles in the scaffold, researchers can achieve even longer 
emission wavelengths, extending into the shortwave
infrared (SWIR, 10002000 nm, also known as NIRII) 
region for in vivo imaging with deeper penetration and 
extraordinary contrast.58 
As with any fluorophore, heptamethine dyes require 
modification prior to biological applications to introduce 
proper physical property, chemical behavior, andor bio
logical activity.
