Description:
A type of sulfide used in sodium-based solid electrolytes with a narrow electrochemical stability window.

The design of SEs must balance various 
properties, such as superionic conductivities (103 Scm), electrochemical stability against both 
electrodes and processability.810 Traditional inorganic Nabased SE families include oxide ceramics 
(NASICONtype oxides11,12, Al2O313) and sulfides (Na3PS4,14 Na2.9Sb0.9W0.1S4,15,16 Na11Sn2PS12type17,18). However, both have drawbacks oxide ceramics have high interfacial impedance and require high 
sintering temperatures. At the same time, sulfides exhibit a narrow electrochemical stability window, 
making them incompatible with highvoltage cathodes and sodium metal.19
