Text:
Succinic acid (SA) is a significant dicarboxylic acid, generally known as butanedioic acid or 
amber acid 1. SA market is going to increase due to its usage in food and chemical industry 
mainly as an acidity regulator. The 7 growth rate of SA in the period 2019 to 2025 is estimated 
2. Rather than other synthetic methods of production of SA, fermentation process taking 
attention due to environmental concern 3. In fermentation process, A. succinogenes, M. 
succiniciproducens and A. succiniciproducens microorganisms used for efficient SA production 
4 5. The SA produced from fermentation broth is in aqueous form and need to recover the acid.
