The limonoid natural products are a diverse family of terpe
noids characterized by their structurally conserved C17furan 
and various modes of skeletal rearrangements.1,2 A fascinating 
subfamily of these natural products, the limonoid alkaloids, 
are recently isolated from the Chinese mangrove, Xylocarpus 
granatum.3,4 The structural hallmark of the limonoid alkaloids 
is the tetrasubstituted pyridine embedded in the core structure 
(Scheme 1), as typified by xylogranatopyridine B (11) and 
granatumine A (12). Furthermore, granatumine A (12) is a 
member of the bislactone limonoid alkaloids, in which the A
ring has undergone further modification to form a 5mem
bered lactone ring fused to the 6membered ring adjacent to 
the pyridine.

More recently, there have been numerous methodolog
ical advancements in the synthesis of highly substituted pyri
dines, many of which utilize transitionmetal catalyzed cross
coupling.7 However, these methodologies have rarely been 
tested in the realm of complex molecule synthesis. These li
monoid alkaloid natural products inspired a compelling ques
tion what are the most effective ways to use ring synthesis as 
a tool for convergence in the context of such highly substituted 
pyridines? Biosynthetically, it has been suggested that the tetrasubsti
tuted pyridine lodged in the limonoid alkaloids arises from a 
mexicanolidetype limonoid containing a C9hydroxyl group 
such as 21 (Scheme 2),4b or a limonoid at a different oxidation 
state.
