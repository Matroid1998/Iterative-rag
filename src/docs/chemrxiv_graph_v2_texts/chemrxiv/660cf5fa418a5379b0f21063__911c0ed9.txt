Abstract
This communication introduces a Kaband phase shifter that leverages a blend of the donor polymer PM6 and
nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) Y7 organic materials. The design integrates a coplanar waveguide (CPW) with a spin
coated thin film of PM6Y7 blend, characterized by its dielectric nonlinearity and light sensitivity. An applied electric
field between the CPW signal and ground electrodes governs the phase shift mechanism, effectively modulating the
permittivity of the blend.
