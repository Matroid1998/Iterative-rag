Description:
A more abundant, less expensive, and less toxic alternative to other transition metals.

Text:
Transition metal based molecular systems have long been
recognised as promising candidates for molecular devices. 13
Possible applications include lightharvesting systems, 4 data
storage devices 5,6 and molecular switches. Current research
trends aim at replacing the originally employed transition
metals (e.g. Ru, Os, Rh, Ir) with more abundant, less
expensive and less toxic alternatives, such as iron. Light
induced switching between the singlet ground state and
the metastable quintet excited state has been demonstrated
for several Fe(II) complexes at low temperature. 7,8. Un
fortunately, in the complexes investigated so far the short
room temperature lifetime of the quintet state makes their
application in practical switching devices impossible.
