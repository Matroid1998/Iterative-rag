Description:
Investigated as a p and n dopant in 2D materials for electronic applications.

Text:
Materials constructed from the large number of 2D materials now identified1 offer enormous 
possibilities for fundamental research, promising improved or even novel electronic or optical 
technologies.2 Recently, there has been increased interest in the LEGOlike creation of few
layer hybrid 2D heterostructures3 for photovoltaic and photonic applications.4,5,6,7,8 For 
example hybrid 2D heterostructures, in which the charge carriers move in the direction 
perpendicular to the plane of the 2D layers, have recently attracted attention as potential 
vertical pn junctions. The 2D materials that have been investigated as p and n dopants 
include MoS2, MoSe2, WSe2.
