Description:
Used in the glass industry as a transparent layer.

Text:
It is found out that all the considered doping atoms reduce () , resulting in 
enhanced adsorption of the air hydrocarbons at the surface, which leads to an increased water contact angle. Based 
on the obtained results, an assessment on the applicability of doped CeO2 in glass industry is made. It is concluded 
that Zrdoped CeO2 possesses the most prominent properties among considered systems for the application as 
transparent layer. Keywords
