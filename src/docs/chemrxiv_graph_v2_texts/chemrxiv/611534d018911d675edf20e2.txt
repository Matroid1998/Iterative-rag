Description:
Used in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries as part of ion conducting ceramics for electrolytes.

Text:
Allsolidstate lithiumion batteries that use ion
conducting ceramics as electrolytes have the potential to
replace commercial lithiumion cells that use liquid elec
trolytes, oering improved energy densities and reliabil
ity 1, 2. A practical solid electrolyte should have a high
ionic conductivity to allow fast charge and discharge rates
and high power output. To achieve this goal, consider
able research eort has been directed towards both the
discovery of new materials with intrinsically high ionic
mobilities 36 and to deriving general principles that
can explain how chemical or structural variations within
solid electrolytes modulate lithium transport 710.

Description:
In lithium ion solid electrolytes, doping can increase the concentration of lithium vacancies or lithium interstitials, affecting ionic conductivity.

Text:
First, aliovalent doping should preferentially in
crease the concentrations of chargecarrying mobile de
fects ahead of competing immobile defects. For lithium
ion solid electrolytes, doping should preferentially in
crease the concentration of either lithium vacancies or
lithium interstitials. Second, any increase in the concen
tration of chargecarrying defects should produce a corre
sponding increase in ionic conductivity. This may not be
the case if the ionic conductivity has some dependence on
defects other than those being targeted through doping. In solid electrolytes that contain more than one charge
carrying defect species, increasing the concentration of
the minority defect species may have little practical eect
on the overall ionic conductivity.
