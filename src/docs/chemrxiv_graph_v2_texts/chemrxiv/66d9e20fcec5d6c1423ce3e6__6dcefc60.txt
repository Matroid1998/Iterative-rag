Description:
A p-type material with relatively high thermoelectric performance.

It would be ideal to use the same material
as the p and ntype legs to avoid device failure due to different
coefficients of thermal expansion and other issues. While ptype
BiCuSeO exhibits relatively high TE performance, it is challenging
to obtain ntype BiCuSeO.9 Attempts to dope BiCuSeO ntype with
halogens,1012 and transition metals,8,13 have resulted in either
low power factors andor anomalous pnp transitions in the con
ductivity type with T. Therefore, an alternative ntype material is
needed to pair with ptype BiCuSeO in a TE device. Bi2SeO2 has emerged as a potential ntype material to pair with
ptype BiCuSeO in TE devices. The crystal structure of Bi2SeO2
can be thought of as BiCuSeOderived with missing Cu.
