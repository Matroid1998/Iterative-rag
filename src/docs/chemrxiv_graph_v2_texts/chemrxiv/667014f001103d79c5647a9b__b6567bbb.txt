Compounds containing carbon-carbon double bonds, pivotal in olefin metathesis.

Text:
Organometallic chemistry currently stands as one of the most dynamically advancing branches of 
chemistry. Within this domain, olefin metathesis plays a pivotal role, facilitating wideranging func
tionalisation of compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds.1 As a result, its application ex
tends to both industrial sectors such as petroleum and plastics, as well as laboratory settings.2 One of 
the current challenges of this methodology is to develop catalytic methods for the synthesis of olefins 
as a single stereoisomer, since the geometry of double bond has great influence on, for example, bio
logical activity of pharmaceutical ingredients or physical properties of polymers.3

GruI, Figure 1) enabled the widespread use of olefin metathesis in the academy.4 In subsequent 
years, ruthenium catalysts underwent a series of diverse modifications. Substitution of one of the 
phosphines with an Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand yielded a noticeable enhancement in activity 
(GruII, Figure 1),5 while the replacement of ordinary styrene with isopropoxystyrene increased the 
stability of the catalyst (HovII, Figure 1).6 In 2011, Grubbs developed the first Zselective ruthenium 
catalysts bearing an adamantyl group (Ru1, Ru2, Figure 1).7 Further contributions were made by 
Jensen (Ru3, Figure 1), who developed complexes with 2,4,6triphenylbenzenethiolate ligand,8 as well 
as by Schrock and Hoveyda introducing a series of molybdenum complexes (e.g.
