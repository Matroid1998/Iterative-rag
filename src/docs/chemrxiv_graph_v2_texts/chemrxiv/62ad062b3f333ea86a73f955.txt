Description:
A component of MRTX1719 linked to pyrazole by an axis of chirality.

Text:
In the case of atropisomers, the desired 
stereoisomer can be regenerated by effecting rotation about the 
axis of chirality, where heat is the typical impetus for 
epimerization.7 This process of recycling compound is iterative 
and the diminishing returns of each successive cycle render it 
tedious. Further, the growing heathistory of the sample tends to 
cause growth of impurities which can be difficult to purge. MRTX1719 (1a) is an emerging oncology therapy.8 It contains an 
axis of chirality about the bond linking the pyrazole and benzene 
rings (Figure 1).
