Description:
Applied as fatty acid binding protein inhibitors.

Text:
3,4dichlorophenyl 1,1diethylpropyl PCA is involved in coppercatalyzed 1,4addition 
of organoboronates to alkylidene cyanoacetates 11. Dihalogen ringsubstituted ethyl 12, 
propyl 13, and butyl 14 PCAs were prepared and copolymerized with styrene. 3,5
Difluorophenyl ethyl PCA is mentioned in Knoevenagel condensation catalytic studies 
related to ionic liquid covalently modified magnesiumaluminum hydrotalcite amphiphilic 
catalytic material 15; in application of bicyclic pyridine derivatives as fatty acid binding 
protein inhibitors 16; in synthesis and copolymerization with styrene 17. (2E)3,5
