Description:
Used in catalysts for CH halogenation, particularly CH fluorination.

Text:
While late transition metals like 
palladium have been frequently used in experimental studies in the 
past6067, recent studies are shifting towards the use of catalysts 
containing manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel68, etc. as they show 
comparable or even better reactivity than the late transition metal 
catalysts60, 6971. Of the midrow 3d metal catalysts, manganese 
catalysts for CH fluorination look particularly attractive due to 
the nontoxicity of manganese, its relatively low cost, and 
environment friendly characteristics60, 
67, 
7274. Manganese 
enzymes75 found in nature can activate CH bonds with high 
dissociation energy, which led to development of bioinspired 
molecular catalysts60. Several experimental studies and few computational studies 
considered Mnporphyrin catalysts and Mnsalen catalysts to carry 
out CH halogenation, in particular, CH fluorination12, 7677.

Description:
Complexes that catalyze selective aliphatic CH bond halogenations with remarkable yields.

Text:
Manganesecatalyzed oxidative benzylic CH fluorination was 
shown to be accomplished with better yields using Mnsalen 
catalysts2. Mnporphyrin complexes were found to catalyze 
selective aliphatic CH bond halogenations with remarkable 
yields for a certain range of organic substrates1, 76. However, our 
attempts to fluorinate druglike molecules (e.g., containing 
heterocycles with N or O atoms) under the same experimental 
conditions were excluded. The reasons for this inapplicability of 
the published procedures of synthesis to druglike molecules, as 
far as we know, are unclear. Manganese exists in different oxidation states in the intermediates 
formed during a catalytic cycle12, 76, 7881. The presence of unpaired 
d electrons indicates a possibility of multiple spin states for each 
intermediate.
