Description:
Involved in sulphur-centered hydrogen bonding important in materials science and biological systems.

A large number of studies have 
been carried out on the structural properties of water clusters; we skipped the discussion here for brevity.2327 
Hydrogen sulphide is the one of the interest of HB study because sulphurcentered hydrogen bonding (SCHBs) 
have drawn more attention due to their prevalence and importance in both materials science and biological 
systems.28,29 Many different properties (i.e., dipole moment, polarities, dispersion energy contribution etc.) of H2S 
clusters were observed from the typical hydrogenbonded clusters.3033 H2S dimer has been the subject of a number 
of theoretical and experimental studies reported in the literature.3440 For instance, using IRpredissociation 
spectroscopy, Wategaonkar et al.34 detected the redshift in protondonating SH bond by 31 cm1 in H2S dimer.
