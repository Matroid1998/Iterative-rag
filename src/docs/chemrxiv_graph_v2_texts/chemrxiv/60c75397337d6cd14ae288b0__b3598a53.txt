Description:
Synthesized for photoredox applications and linked with biomolecules having oxidative quencher.

Text:
Several research group7,8,9,10 
explored excitedstate charge distribution and electron transfer (ET) in ruthenium complexes 
especially in combination with proteins and polypeptides 
Present work In continuing our work on photoredox, we succeeded in synthesizing the 
Fluorescence Probe11 to investigate cytochrome c folding kinetics and Synthesizing the 
photoredox ruthenium bipyridyl were linked with biomolecules having oxidative quencher,

viologen12, herein we disclosed design of RutheniumDipeptide molecule 1 (figure1) which 
allows for many variations of the ruthenium Phenanthroline5Amine 3 and dipeptide 
structures 2, The synthetic routes are straightforward and very manageable, it is possible to 
use commercially available Lamino acids as enantiomerically enriched starting materials.
