Description:
Forms structurally diverse catalytically active complexes used in the hydroboration of unsaturated CN bonds.

Text:
The use of iron complexes in the hydrob
oration of unsaturated CN bonds has been overshadowed 
by work with precious metals, however, in recent years a 
range of structurally diverse catalytically active iron com
plexes have emerged (Figure 1).

Description:
Catalyzes nitrile hydroboration using a cooperative iron-indium heterobimetallic system.

Text:
The first example of iron
catalyzed nitrile hydroboration was reported by Nakazawa 
using a cooperative ironindium heterobimetallic system, 
1a.23 Findlater and coworkers reported an iron complex 
bearing the redox active bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN) 
ligand for nitrile hydroboration without the use of an exog
enous activator, 1b.24 Recently, Hashimoto and coworkers 
reported the use of an iron silylNHC complex 1c with acti
vation via UV irradiation ( 300 nm) to promote nitrile re
duction with HBpin.25 There has been even less develop
ment in iron catalysis for the functionalization of Nhet
eroarenes, in 2017 Tung and Wang reported a N2bridged 
diiron complex, 1d, and showed it to catalyze the selective 
1,2hydroboration of Nheteroarenes.26 Liang and Song also 
utilized a piano stool iron(II) complex, 1e, for the 1,4
