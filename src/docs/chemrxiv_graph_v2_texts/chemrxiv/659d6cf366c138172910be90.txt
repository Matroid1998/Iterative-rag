Description:
A first-line oral antituberculosis agent.

Text:
Due to the rise in resistant species, some 
bacterial infections have become public health threads. For instance, tuberculosis, a serious lung 
disease requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy, is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT). Many species of MT are resistant to the firstline oral antituberculosis agents isoniazid and 
rifampicin and are designated MDR TB.8, 9 MDR TB requires the use of secondline drugs which 
require parenteral delivery and often have significant side effects, reducing the likelihood that 
treatment is completed and thus facilitating resistance. More extensively resistant variants such 
as extensively drugresistant TB (XDRTB) are resistant to secondline antitubercular therapies, 
and in rare cases, MT can be resistant to all available therapies (totally drugresistant TB (TDR
TB).1012.
