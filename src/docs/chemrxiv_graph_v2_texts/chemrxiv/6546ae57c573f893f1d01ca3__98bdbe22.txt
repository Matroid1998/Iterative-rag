Description:
An expanded pincer ligand used in the synthesis of a Frustrated Lewis Trio with early metals.

The threecentre 
bonding in these FLTs, was calculated to be strong, highly directional 
while displaying baseacidbase angles between 170175 (Figure 1, b). Moreover, Echeverra found hints towards their existence in the crystal 
lattice of reported group 13 compounds. Despite the elegant simplicity 
of the concept, to the best of our knowledge experimental FLTs are 
unknown. Molecular designs that generate isolable FLTs, can enable 
investigations towards the behaviour of this motif, wherein the Lewis 
bases could play a beneficial dual role in heterolytic bond activation. While exploring the chemistry of the tBuPNNP expanded 
pincer ligand33 with early metals, we serendipitously synthesised the 
first isolated example of a theoretically predicted Frustrated Lewis Trio 
(Figure 1, d).
