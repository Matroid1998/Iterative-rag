Description:
Pure electrodes used as a comparison for stability studies.

Text:
The measure
ments indicated that these electrodes are sur
prisingly stable up to 1.4 V, in contrast to the
submonolayer Pt modified Ru(0001) electrodes
studied previously,5355 or to pure Pt(111) elec
trodes.5660 Inspired by this finding, we then
explored the stability of Ptmodified Ru(0001)
electrodes with a Pt thickness of one and three
layers for the COOR.
