Description:
Compounds involved in chloroarylation reactions.

Text:
Recently, we described the development of a dual cata
lytic platform for the aryl functionalization of alkenes based on a 
photocatalytic reduction of diaryliodonium salts, to generate an aryl 
radical that adds to an alkene, and a separate transition metal cata
lyzed group transfer cycle that orchestrates a reaction between the 
incipient homobenzylic radical and an anionic nucleophile. This 
platform resulted in new methods for the azidoarylation of alkenes13 
and the chloroarylation of vinyl boronic esters14. A compelling as
pect of this activation mode is the capacity to select from several dif
ferent photocatalysts and group transfer catalysts, respectively, in re
sponse to the diverse needs of the reaction.
