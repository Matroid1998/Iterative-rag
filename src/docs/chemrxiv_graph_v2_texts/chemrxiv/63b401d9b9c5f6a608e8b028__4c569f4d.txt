Description:
Polymers with SiOSi bound backbones that are thermally stable, chemically inert, and highly flexible.

Text:
Silicone polymers are widely used in applications ranging 
from lubricants, construction  automotive materials, 
electronics, medical formulations  engineered materials.1,2 In 
2020, the worlds production of silicones was over 8 million 
tons, representing a market value at 15.1 billion USD.3 Silicone 
polymers consist of SiOSi bound highly resistant backbones. SiO bonds are longer than CO bonds and the bond angle for Si
OSi is wider than that in carbon analogues. These materials are 
thus thermally stable, mostly chemically inert (except to strong 
acids and bases) and highly flexible.3 Recycling of these high
value inorganic polymers has become strategic for both 
environmental and economic reasons. Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) is one of the most important 
silicone products.

Description:
Subject to chemical recycling processes studied for over 80 years.

Text:
The chemical recycling of waste silicones has been widely 
studied for over 80 years.10 Initially, the decomposition of 
polysiloxanes was carried out at very high temperature (600C) 
under inert condition or in air (300C).14 On the one hand, the 
reaction at 600C gives a mixture of cyclosiloxanes (D3D8) 
favouring small cycles. On the other hand, CO2 and silica are 
observed as the major products for the thermal cracking in air 
at 300C. Besides, steam could be used as an agent for the 
conversion of the polysiloxanes at high temperature to 
(oligo)silanols.15 However, most of these methods require high 
temperature and give a moderate yield of a mixture of products 
such as cyclic siloxanes, but also silanols, silica, etc.
