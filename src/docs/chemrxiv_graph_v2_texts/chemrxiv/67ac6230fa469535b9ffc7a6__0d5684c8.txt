Description:
Reacts with aqueous electrons to form a chloride ion and a carbon-centered radical.

Text:
The proposed mechanism is that an aqueous electron generated 
from water radiolysis reacts with an organochloride to form a chloride ion and a carbon
centred radical. The radical reacts with dissolved molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl 
radical, which is a strong oxidant. The results show that the oxidation depends on the 
concentration of organochloride higher concentration of organochloride leads to more 
pronounced oxidation. We hypothesize that the molar ratio of dissolved oxygen to 
organochloride affects the yield of the peroxyradical, since oxygen can compete with 
organochloride to react with aqueous electrons.17 
In this work, we propose a reaction network which includes key reactions of the pathway 
of peroxylradical formation.

Description:
A compound whose concentration affects the yield of reactive oxygen species.

Text:
Based on the proposed reaction network, we have developed 
a kinetic model using previously developed ChemFit software.18 By numerically solving the 
system of ODEs, we simulated the yield of peroxyradical at different starting concentrations 
of oxygen and organochloride (Scheme 1). The simulation suggested that, at a fixed 
concentration of organochloride, the yield of ROS increased with decreasing concentration
