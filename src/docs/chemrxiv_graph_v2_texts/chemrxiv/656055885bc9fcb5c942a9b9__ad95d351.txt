Description:
Used as a reductant in hydrogenation reactions, offering excellent atom economy.

The hydrogenation of carboncarbon double and triple bonds is a fundamental chemical reaction with 
important applications in the food, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries, etc.13 Traditionally, 
hydrogenation reactions use a metal catalyst, usually Pd or Pt, with hydrogen gas (H2) as the reductant.2 
Rare metal catalysts are prominent in this field, so if they could be replaced by a more abundant metal 
such as nickel, this could, in principle, offer a more sustainable alternative.2,4,5 For example, catalysts such 
as Raney nickel or nickel oxide have been used extensively in hydrogenation reactions.57 
The use of H2 as the reductant gives excellent atom economy, but also presents major drawbacks 
hydrogen gas is derived primarily from fossil resources, and it is also a hazardous material.810 One viable 
alternative is to use electrochemical water splitting that occurs during the hydrogen evolution reaction 
(HER) as source of hydrogen atoms.11 In this way, hydrogen sourcing, transportation and manipulation 
can be avoided.
