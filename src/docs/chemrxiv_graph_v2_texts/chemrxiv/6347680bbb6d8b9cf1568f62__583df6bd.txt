Description:
An endogenous arylethylamine involved in the neurochemistry of emotion, memory, and addiction.

In 1900, the first isolation of epinephrine from bovine adrenal glands and its 
demonstration as a potent vasopressor was a landmark achievement in the budding field of 
pharmacology.1 Over a century later, the intricate functions of arylethylamines remain the foci of intense 
study.2 Endogenous arylethylamines including dopamine and serotonin underlie the neurochemistry of 
emotion, memory, and addiction.35 Drugs with incorporated arylethylamine connectivity have been 
developed to treat heart disease6 and cancer7 (Scheme 1A) among numerous other indications. The arene 
and ethylene portions bear several potential sites of substitution that can act as synthetic handles to tune 
the molecules metabolic and pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, a modular method to prepare this 
pharmacophore would provide an enabling tool in discovery chemistry.
