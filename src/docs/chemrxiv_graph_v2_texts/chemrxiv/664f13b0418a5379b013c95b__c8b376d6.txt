Enzymes are versatile catalysts that enable the biosynthesis of complex chemical 
compounds with high chemo, regio, and stereospecificity under mild conditions.1 The growing 
need for green catalysts has sparked interest in applying computational approaches and directed 
evolution to engineer nonnative enzymes with enhanced reactivity and the capability to perform 
novel chemical transformations.27 Heme proteins, which contain a protoporphyrin IX cofactor 
typically with a coordinated iron cation, are of particular interest as they catalyze a remarkable 
array of challenging reactions, including hydroxylation,8 halogenation,9 peroxidation,10 
sulfoxidation,11 and CC bond cleavage12, and can be tuned by modifying the protein scaffold and 
the coordinating environment of the reactive highvalent metal center.13 The tunability of the 
protein and metal environments has served as inspiration for an array of de novo designed enzymes 
that display equivalent or superior reactivities to their natural counterparts and can carry out 
reactions not found in nature.1417 However, despite successes, the complexity of natural enzymes 
has made it difficult to extract design principles from structurefunction relationships and quantify 
the core requirements for catalytic activity.18 To facilitate the investigation of the requirements for 
the protein environment in enzymatic heme catalysis, several miniaturized hemebased enzyme 
systems have been developed.1924 
Exemplary of an miniaturized metalloenzyme system, the family of de novo minienzymes 
known as mimochromes consist of a fivecoordinate heme iron consisting of a deuteroporphyrin 
covalently bound to two nonapeptides with the proximal peptide coordinating iron through an axial 
histidine (Figure 1).25 Due to the simplicity of the protein environment, the reactivity of the 
mimochrome family has been successfully tuned and optimized over several generations through 
principles of rational design.26 There are three main catalytically active mimochromes exhibiting
