Description:
A conducting polymer known for its ability to transport electronic and ionic charges.

Text:
Conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), and poly(3,4ethylene 
dioxythiophene)poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOTPSS) are versatile materials across bioelectronic 
applications. They have gained significant attention for their relative softness compared with 
inorganic materials, ability to transport both electronic and ionic charges, and ease of fabrication 
via solution processing.1 Particularly, their deployment as scaffolds and hydrogels has enabled 
unique interpenetration and integration with biological systems,24 through the formation of 
electricallyconductive materials with properties typically only achievable in insulating polymers.
