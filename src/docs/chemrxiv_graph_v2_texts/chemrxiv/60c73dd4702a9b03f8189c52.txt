Description:
Used in antifouling films and coatings.

Text:
These surfaces include
antifouling poly(ethylene oxide) lms7,8 and selfhealing coatings.9 Surprisingly, although a
number of reports exist of the preparation of block copolymers grown from surfaces using
SIROMP,7,8 the present work is the rst published example (to our knowledge) of poly
mers grown using surfacedirected ROMP to prepare polymer lms or brushes deliberately
endfunctionalized with small molecules (rather than a second polymer segment in a block
copolymerization). Polymer brushes or surfacebound thin lms modied specically with
small molecules are interesting for molecular wire type applications where we connect an
electrically active species  say, an enzyme cofactor, or a photosensitizer  to the surface of
an electrode.
