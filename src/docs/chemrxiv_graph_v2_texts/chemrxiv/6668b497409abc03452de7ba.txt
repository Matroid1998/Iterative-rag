Description:
A diatomic molecule with covalent bonding characteristics.

To provide a brief outline of this discussion,
it is worth mentioning works related to the
ambiguity of the concepts of ionicity and co
valency in chemical bonds,2,3 as well as at
tempts to explain the covalency of the bond
in the hydrogen molecule and other diatomic
molecules.1,46 Our contribution to this discus
sion has been to provide the complementary
characteristics of the chemical bond such as the
atomicity and true covalency7,8 or our newest
paper about entanglement correlations as the
alternative bonding characteristic.9
In this paper, we use the EDABI approach to
investigate the detailed electronic structure of
hydrogenbased molecular systems, specifically
H 
2 , H2, and H 
2 .
