35 In addition, bismuth is the heaviest stable element in the Periodic Table of the 
elements, and the strength of the spinorbit interaction increases with the atomic number. Since 
topological insulators exhibit band inversion driven by the spinorbit interactions, bismuthide 
Zintl phases are expected to exhibit highest TE performance compared to lighter analogues.29
30 
In fact, the most common and successful strategy to increase the efficiency of TE materials has 
been to modifying an already promising compound by introducing point defects mainly through 
alloying.18,20,22,28 The resulting isostructural solid solutions have much lower lattice thermal 
conductivity, due to the strong phonon scattering by the introduced point defects. This can result
