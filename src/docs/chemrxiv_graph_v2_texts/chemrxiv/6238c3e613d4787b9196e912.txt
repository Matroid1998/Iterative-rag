Description:
A metal used as an anode in high-energy density batteries.

The glassy lithium phosphorus oxynitride LixPOyNz
(with unknown stoichiometry), termed as LiPON, is
one of the few Liion solid electrolytes considered to
be electrochemically stable against lithium(Li)metal
anode.1420 The chemical composition of LiPON, let
aside its structure,
has been the subject of many
studies.15, 19, 20 A cycle life of 10,000 with 90 ca
pacity retention has been claimed for ASSBs incorpo
rating LiPON electrolyte paired with highenergy den
sity Limetal anode and a spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cath
ode. 21 Despite the good interfacial stability indicated
by the device performance, rstprinciples calculations
have shown that the decomposition of LiPON and the
consequent formation of LiLiPON SEIs are thermody
namically favorable.9, 11, 13 LiPON reacts with Li and
