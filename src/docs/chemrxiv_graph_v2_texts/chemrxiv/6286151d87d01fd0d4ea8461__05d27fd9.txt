Description:
Compounds that undergo photochemical irradiation to eliminate nitrogen and form carbenes.

and Aim. Aliphatic diazirines (type A, Figure 1) 
were discovered first in the 1960s by Abendroth with Henrich;1 
Paulsen;2 and Schmitz with Ohme.3 Their thermal decomposition 
was originally studied as an approach to carbenes.4 Photochemical 
irradiation of diazirines also leads to the elimination of nitrogen 
and the formation of carbenes.5 The latter can insert at the CH 
and NH, CH, SH bonds to crosslink with proximal species.

Popular photoaffinity labels in both dialkyl and trifluoromethylaryl forms.

Therefore, aliphatic diazirines have become common labels for 
photoaffinity studies.611 It is worth noting that aliphatic diazirines 
tend to undergo the undesired 1,2hydrogen rearrangement into 
alkenes.12 
In 1973, Knowles studied the utility of aromatic diazirines for 
photolabeling.13 Under irradiation, however, they extensively 
isomerized into the more stable diazo compounds that caused the 
nonspecific labeling.14 In 1980, Brunner demonstrated that the 
trifluoromethylsubstituted aromatic diazirines (type B, Figure 1) 
were more useful as photoaffinity labels, because the undesired 
isomerization products  CF3diazo compounds CF3C(N2)Ar,  
were inert and did not cause the nonselective labeling.15 Since 
that time, chemists have been commonly using trifluoromethyl
substituted aromatic diazirines as labels to replace aromatic 
fragments in bioactive compounds for photoaffinity studies.1618 
Both types of diazirines  dialkyl and trifluoromethylaryl (types 
A and B, Figure 1)  are popular today.9,1923 
In 1984, Meese showed that in strict contrast to diazomethane 
or alkyl diazomethanes (CH2N2, MeCHN2), trifluorodiazoethane 
(CF3CHN2) did not react with carboxylic acids.24,25 Therefore, we 
wondered if aliphatic fluoroalkylsubstituted diazirines (type C, 
Figure 1) could be used as photoaffinity labels.
