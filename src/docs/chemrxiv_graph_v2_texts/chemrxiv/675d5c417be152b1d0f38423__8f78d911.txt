Description:
A catalyst used in proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL).

The use of hydrogen as an energy vector has been declared an essential strategy for the European Union
(EU) for decarbonization of its energy generation and to reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels. However, in 2022, only 2 of Europes energy was provided by H2, and of that, 96 was produced from
natural gas 1. Currently, there are four major electrolyzer technologies Proton exchange membrane
electrolysis (PEMEL), alkaline electrolysis (AEL), anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMEL),
and solid oxide electrolysis (SOEL). Amongst them, AEL and PEMEL are the most mature and commer
cially available 2. PEMEL relies heavily on platinum group metals (PGMs) as catalysts, which hinders its
largescale deployment 3, 4.
