Description:
React with alkylphenols in condensation reactions to form phenolic resins.

Text:
Epoxy molding compounds used to protect semiconductor circuits from 
environmental factors such as moisture, heat, and shock are typically based on 
diglycidyl ethers of various bisphenol A derivatives and socalled phenolaralkyl 
resins, which are products of the condensation reaction between aldehydes and 
alkylphenols, as hardeners. In addition, additives and fillers are used, and an 
important component is the socalled accelerator, which accelerates the curing of 
the resin typically at temperatures above 150 C and increases the number of 
molding cycles for mass production 1,2,3,4,5. In particular, triarylphosphine 
accelerated formulations have optimal physical properties when cured, which 
subsequently improves the reliability of the encapsulated semiconductors 
6,7,8,9 and recent work is attempting to further improve their properties 
10,11,12.
