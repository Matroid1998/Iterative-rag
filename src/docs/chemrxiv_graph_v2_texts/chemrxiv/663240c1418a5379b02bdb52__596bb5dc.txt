Mangiferin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic heterocyclic organic compound, 
also known as quinomine or alpizarin, that is generally found in plants such as 
Mangifera indica, which belongs to the class of Xanthones13. 1,3,6,7
tetrahydroxy2((2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)3,4,5trihydroxy6(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro
2Hpyran2yl)9Hxanthen9one, or mangiferin, has two of the important 
functionalized rings, xanthone and pyranose4. Broad research discovers its 
chemical and pharmaceutical properties, basically introducing structural 
modifications to its effectiveness with respect to various biological activities like 
antiinflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, immunosuppressive antitumour, 
antidiabetic, laxative, antiviral, cardiotonic, hemoptysis, analgesic, cytoprotective 
effect, antimalarial, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antipsychotic, antihypertensive 
activities etc556. Mangiferin has also exhibited good inhibitory activities on kinase 
family enzymes2127, 50, 5761. Mangiferin has gained great importance owing to its 
anticancer activity in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer6272.
