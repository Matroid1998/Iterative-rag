Description:
A hazardous solvent avoided in the synthesis of AlMIL53Fum.

To overcome these challenges, synthesis protocols 
suitable for industrial scaleup have to be developed while 
taking into account pricing of the final product.10,11 In this 
respect, a particularly interesting MOF is aluminium fumarate, 
also known as AlMIL53Fum (MIL  Material Institute 
Lavoisier).12 It exhibits high porosity and stability, even under 
hydrothermal stress,13 and therefore sparked the interest of 
industrial researchers.14 In particular, the sigmoidal water ad
desorption curve without hysteresis demonstrated by AlMIL
53Fum and other AlMOFs is attractive for applications in heat
exchange devices.1517 The patented synthesis of AlMIL53Fum 
is a hydrothermal batch process that makes use of inexpensive 
and readily available starting materials (fumaric acid, NaOH, 
aluminium sulfate) and avoids hazardous solvents such as 
dimethylformamide.18 Similar mild synthesis conditions ( 100 
C) have been demonstrated for other AlMOFs,1922 thereby 
avoiding pressure buildup.
