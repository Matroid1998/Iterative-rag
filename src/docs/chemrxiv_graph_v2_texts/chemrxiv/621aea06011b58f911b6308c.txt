Description:
Nonconventional luminophores comprising electron-rich heteroatoms with lone pair electrons or isolated unsaturated bonds.

AIEgens generally possess noncoplanar and rotational groups, 
preventing them from   stacking and limiting intramolecular rotation and vibration in the 
aggregate state.11, 12 
On the other hand, traditional AIE or ACQ luminogens containing large conjugated aromatic 
systems have been extensively explored, in which their luminescence generally resulted from 
the most favourable  transition.13 Recent studies have demonstrated an uncommon 
phenomenon that some compounds devoid of a conjugated aromatic system can still emit 
light.14 Unlike aromatic ACQ or AIE luminogen, nonconventional luminophores comprise 
electronrich heteroatoms with lone pair electron or isolated unsaturated bonds (e.g, CC, CO, 
CN, CN).15 These chromophores can form into a cluster and the luminescence is originated 
from n transition. The abovementioned luminophores reveal similar AIE characteristics 
which show intrinsic emission in the concentrated or solid state.
