Description:
A functionality used in well-developed aryne synthesis precursors.

Text:
Many 
strategies for aryne synthesis are available,10 and Kobayashi
precursors based on the osilylaryltriflate functionality are 
particularly well developed.11 In this approach, fluoride ions 
induce aryne formation from benchstable precursors in a 
temperature range in between 0 C to 100 C.8 
Arylated organophosphorous compounds are important building 
blocks in organic synthesis including various applications in 
medicinal chemistry,12 polymer science13 or as ligands in 
transition metal catalysis.14,15 Arynebased methodologies have 
played a significant role in targeting such arylphosphorous 
compounds (scheme 1, A).16,17 In 2010, Jug et al.
