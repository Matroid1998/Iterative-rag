Description:
Used in copper-mediated conjugate addition-SN2 reactions.

This highlights the power of these reaction 
manifolds in the construction of CC quaternary bonds in 
congested environments.14 Secondly, the tertbutyl group was 
invariably incorporated into these natural products via the 
coppermediated conjugate additionSN2 reaction of tertbutyl 
lithium. Further to these studies, the synthesis of truncated analogues 
of the ginkgolides has also been investigated (Figure 1C).
