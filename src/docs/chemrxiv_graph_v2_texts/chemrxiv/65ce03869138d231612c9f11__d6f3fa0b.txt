Description:
A garnet-type solid electrolyte with theoretically strong mechanical properties.

Their nonflammability would also eliminate safety issues8. However,
studies have shown that soft lithium metal can still penetrate solid electrolytes, including sulfurbased
materials such as Li6PS5Cl and mechanically robust oxidebased materials like the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12
(LLZO) in its cubic phase911. Given the theoretically strong mechanical properties of LLZO, this work
primarily focuses on this material7,12. There are multiple explanations reported why dendrites can still penetrate LLZO. One report emphasizes
locally enhanced electronic conductivity of LLZO, stemming from chemical inhomogeneities or dopants,
which enables the formation of lithium metal by combining an electron and Li inside the LLZO13. Others
approach the issue from a mechanical perspective, where preexisting cracks or defects are filled with Li.
