Description:
An easily extractable or synthesizable molecule used in the chemical industry.

Gas separation and purification are essential processes since they provide key reactants and
inert gases for the chemical industry, as well as medical or food grade gases. Among them,
there are easily extractable or synthesizable molecules such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon diox
ide, noble gases, hydrogen, methane, or nitrous oxide. Moreover, gas separation is crucial in
mitigating negative environmental impact at the end of industrial processes, such as facilities
emitting green house gases (e.g. concrete or steel plants) or treatment plants for radioactive
offgases like 85Kr.
