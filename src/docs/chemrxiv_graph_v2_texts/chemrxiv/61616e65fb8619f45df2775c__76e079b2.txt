Description:
The tetraphenolic pocket is well suited to bonding Jahn-Teller distorted ions such as CuII and MnIII.

Text:
Structurally, this 
means it acts as a capping vertex in the resulting metallic skeleton.8 The calix4arene tetraphenolic 
pocket is particularly well suited to bonding JahnTeller (JT) distorted ions such as CuII and MnIII 
because it will preferentially coordinate metals possessing four short equatorial and two long axial 
bonds.9,10 
Illustrative 
examples 
include 
the 
complexes 
CuII9(OH)3(TBC4)3Cl2(DMSO)5.5(EtOH)0.5CuICl2 (1, Fig. 1B) and MnIII2MnII2(OH)2(TBC4)2(dmf)6 (2, 
Fig. 1C). In the former the TMTBC4 metalloligand encapsulates a CuII6(OH)3 trigonal prism, and in 
the latter a MnII2(OH)2 dimer.
