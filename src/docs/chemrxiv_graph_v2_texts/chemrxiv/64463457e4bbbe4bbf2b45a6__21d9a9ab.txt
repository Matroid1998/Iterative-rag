Description:
Formed from 13CH4 oxidation with a significant MS signal at mz 33.

of CO induced 
the formation of oxygenated products as well as CO2 (Table 1, Entry 3). The formation rates 
of products increased monotonically with the CO pressure, while the CH3OH selectivity 
remained almost unchanged (Figure S18 and Table S9). The role of CO was also investigated 
by performing CH4 oxidation by O2 in the presence of 13CO instead of CO. The mass spectrum 
of CH3OH formed under 13CO is similar to that under normal CO (Figure S19). Moreover, 
13CH4 oxidation isotopic labeling experiment shows the significant MS signal at mz  33, 
which is ascribed to 13CH3OH.
