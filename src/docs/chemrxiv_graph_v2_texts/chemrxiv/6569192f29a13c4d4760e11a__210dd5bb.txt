Description:
Studied to elucidate the effects of sulfonation on charge transfer mechanisms.

Text:
This latter consideration motivates the present study, which examines the dynamics of 
photoexcited I4thiouracil (I4TU) cluster anions and builds on our previous work on I2
thiouracil (I2TU) to elucidate the effects of sulfonation on charge transfer mechanisms. Within a cell, DNA damage may occur via direct or indirect interactions between photons 
and a DNA strand.
