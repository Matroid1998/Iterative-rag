Description:
A drug first marketed as a racemic mixture, with its S-enantiomer causing severe teratogenic effects.

Chirality is an essential property for many biologically relevant molecules, including bio(macro)molecules 
like sugars, amino acids and their polymers (proteins, polysaccharides, DNARNA). Despite the seemingly 
minute structural difference, enantiomers of drugs can exhibit significant differences in their biological 
activity such as pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, etc.1 For instance, for 
the analgesic drug ibuprofen, its Senantiomer has a higher efficacy than its stereoisomer.1 In the worst 
case, a stereoisomer can produce undesired or toxic effects. A notorious example is thalidomide, which 
was first marketed in 1957 as a racemic mixture, but due to severe teratogenic effects (phocomelia, amelia) 
caused by its Senantiomer, it was withdrawn from the market in the 1960.1 Therefore, the isolation of 
therapeutically active enantiomers is of utmost importance.
