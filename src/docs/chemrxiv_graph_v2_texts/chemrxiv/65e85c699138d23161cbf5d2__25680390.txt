Description:
An energy carrier generated via water electrolysis for the renewable energy economy.

Text:
The generation of clean hydrogen as an energy carrier via 
water electrolysis is becoming central for the modern re
newableenergy economy.14 Of the water electrolysis op
erated at low temperatures, two main techniques, namely, 
alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and proton exchange 
membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, are involved in todays hy
drogen market.1,57 Their unique solidionomer membrane 
property enables PEM to operate at a high current density 
( 2 Acm2), while the locally acidic conditions of PEM re
quire highyield catalysts based on expensive platinum 
group metals (PGM), which drives up the capital ex
penses.7,8 Compared to PEM, AWE operates in liquidalka
line electrolytes that allow the use of inexpensive nonPGM 
materials.
