Description:
An essential feedstock used in various industrial applications ranging from chemical synthesis to energy conversion.

The use of CO2 as a carbon feedstock will be an important component of a sustainable postfossilfuel future. CO2 can be electrochemically reduced into variety of products including hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbon 
monoxide (CO) and formate (HCOO). Recent technoeconomic analyses suggest that twoelectron reduction 
of CO2 into C1 products (i.e., HCOO and CO) presents the best route to economic feasibility in the near future.1
4 CO and HCOO are essential feedstock used in various industrial applications ranging from chemical synthesis 
(FisherTropsch) to energy conversion (e.g., fuel cells) through existing and emerging technologies.59 The 
realization of electrochemical synthesis of these important molecules at large scale will require catalysts with 
high activity and selectivity to the desired products, exceptional stability, sufficient Earthabundance, and broad 
availability.
