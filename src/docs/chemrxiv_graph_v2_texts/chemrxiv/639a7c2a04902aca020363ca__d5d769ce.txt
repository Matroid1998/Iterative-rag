Description:
A noble metal used as a cocatalyst in water-splitting reactions.

Ever since Fujishima and Honda first discovered in 1972, the electrochemical photolysis of
water in the presence of TiO2 catalyst to produce H2 gas has become an active research area
to understand the mechanism of photolysis, and to find cheaper substitutes TiO2 as solutions
to current energy problems.1 Numerous studies show that other nanoscaled metal oxides
can also play an important role as photocatalysts in watersplitting reactions 1 to produce
H2, overcoming the cost and challenges of TiO2.24 However, scaling up H2 gas production
using metal oxides or metal oxide cocatalysts derived from noble metals like Pt, Ru and Rh
is a problem due to the high temperatures required for synthesis and related costs.
