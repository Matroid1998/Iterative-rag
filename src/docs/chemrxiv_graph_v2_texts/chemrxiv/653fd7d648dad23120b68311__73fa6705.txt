Description:
A core structure modified in spirolactone variants like thiofluorescein and carbofluorescein.

Text:
of a 
strongly electrondeficient bridging group has been previously 
demonstrated to shift the absorption and emission maxima, 
mainly by lowering the LUMO energy level of the fluoro
phore,1a into the red range (600 nm) preferred for higher light 
penetration depth and lower phototoxicity. Unlike the spirolac
tone variants with modified xanthene core (thiofluorescein,2 
carbofluorescein3, Sifluorescein4 and their halogenated ver
sions5), only the derivatives with 2alkyl or 2alkoxyphenyl 
pendant ring have been reported for borafluorescein6 and phos
phafluorescein,1 while sulfonebridged fluorone7 analogues of 
fluorescein remain unknown outside of patent literature.8 
A concise synthetic strategy to access sulfonefluoresceins 
would involve nucleophilic addition of aryllithium or aryl
magnesium reagents to the keto group of appropriately substi
tuted 9Hthioxanthen9one 10,10dioxides.

Description:
A component of fluorescein analogues with modified bridging groups.

These heterocy
cles have found use in organic electronics as acceptor units9 in 
building blocks for thermally activated delayed fluorescence 
emitters, in particular in challenging recent applications such as 
phosphorescent10 and circularly polarized OLEDs.11
