Description:
Enhance solubility and bioavailability in drug design.

Text:
The facile synthesis of ethers has long been a task in drug design, as the incorporation of the ether 
group enhances the solubility and bioavailability, thereby improving the druggability.1,2 The hindered 
dialkyl ethers can aid in the escapefromflatland of bioactive molecules and improve the drugtarget 
interaction to promote the drug efficacy and selectivity.3,4 Moreover, the polyfluorinated dialkyl ethers 
exhibit the improved lipophilicity and metabolic stability compared to their nonfluorinated 
counterparts.5,6 Notably, the polyfluorinated ethers are integral for enhancing the performance of lithium
based batteries.7 Therefore, the practical and straightforward synthesis of the hindered and 
polyfluorinated dialkyl ethers has significant value in pharmaceutical and chemical industries.
