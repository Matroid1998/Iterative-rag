Description:
A metabolite of DDT detected in the study.

Text:
of leaded fuel (Gunten et al. 1997), and in Lake Brt the Pb profile roughly 
520 
followed that of other studied elements, i.e., Cu and Hg (Thevenon et al. 2013). Both observations, 
521 
which are present in the current study as well, were ascribed to an overall metal pollution from 
522 
industrial activity as the major source. 523 
4.2 Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) 
524 
Of the DDT group of analytes, only TPs DDD and DDE but no traces of the parent compound DDT 
525 
were detected. The period with the strongest increases and peaks of concentrations was between ca. 526 
1945 and ca. 1975, excluding Lake TF featuring the main peak in ca. 1985. DDX concentrations 
527 
peaked between 30 and 380 gkg1 (median 225 gkg1).
