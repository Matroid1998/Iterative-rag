Description:
An antibiotic whose concentration significantly declines after incubation with M. sciuri TS92 in Mueller-Hinton medium.

Moreover, the detailed elucidation 
of existing resistance mechanisms is of great relevance, as it is both the basis for appropriate 
surveillance measures as well as for targeted structural modification of the antibiotic to 
overcome resistance. In 2017, the highlevel DAP resistant Staphylococcus sciuri strain TS92, reclassified as 
Mammaliicoccus sciuri (M. sciuri) in 2020, was discovered in an AMR study in pig farming 4, 
5. Initial investigations of the underlying resistance mechanism using liquid chromatography 
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) revealed a significant decline of the DAP 
concentration after a 24 h incubation of the antibiotic with M. sciuri TS92 in MuellerHinton 
(MH) medium when applying subinhibitory DAP concentrations 6.
