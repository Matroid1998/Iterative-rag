Description:
A product of NH3 decomposition at high temperatures.

Text:
Since plasma ALD of InN gives films with TMI, and since the plasma discharge is 
not activated when TMI is exposed to the NHx covered InN surface, it is reasonable to 
assume that the limitation to a thermal ALD process for InN is found in the interaction 
between NH3 and the In(CH3)x covered InN surface. Although it is thermodynamically 
favorable for NH3 to decompose into N2 and H2 at the temperatures in the ALD processes, 
the decomposition is limited by very slow kinetics at these temperatures, making NH3 
stable during the residence time in ALD.15 The majority of the NH3 molecules are therefore
