Description:
A CGRP antagonist developed as an improved therapy for migraine attacks, minimizing adverse effects by not directly causing vasoconstriction.

According 
to this theory, migraine can be effectively treated with triptans, which cause vasoconstriction 
in the cerebral vessels but have numerous adverse effects due to their nonselective constriction 
of smooth muscle tissue. They are also contraindicated in some patients with pronounced 
hypertension or heart disease. CGRP antagonists, which include rimegepant, were developed 
as an improved therapy for migraine attacks. These medications improve patients quality of 
life by minimizing the number of adverse effects by not directly causing vasoconstriction1. 2 THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MIGRAINES 
2.1 
Defining migraines 
Migraine is a primary or idiopathic headache that cannot be attributed to a local or systemic 
pathophysiological process. The syndrome manifests as typical recurrent attacks interrupted by 
painfree periods.

Description:
Approved for the preventive treatment of migraine with at least four attacks per month in the EU.

Text:
Currently, many types of migraine are known, the most common being 
migraine without aura and migraine with aura2,3. Rimegepant is already approved for the 
treatment of the above two types of migraine in the U.S. and the EU. Unlike the FDA, the EMA 
has approved rimegepant for the preventive, rather than curative, treatment of patients with at 
least four migraine attacks per month4,5. The typical clinical manifestation of migraine presents primarily as a moderate to severe, 
pulsating, unilateral (hence the name migraine  Gr. hmikrana, half head), long
lasting (several hours to several days) headache that worsens with physical exertion. Approximately 20 of migraine patients have headacherelated transient focal neurological 
symptoms called auras.
