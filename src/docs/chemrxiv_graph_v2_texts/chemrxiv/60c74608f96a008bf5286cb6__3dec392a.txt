Description:
Efficient sensitizers and catalysts in chemical processes, including photodynamic therapy.

Porphyrins (PPs) and their derivatives can be found in many natural biological systems and 
offer potential solutions to a wide range of applications. In plants, PPs are an essential part of 
the chlorophyll pigment that converts solar energy into chemical energy.1 Porphyrinoids also 
have been proven to be efficient sensitizers2 and catalysts3 in several chemical processes, 
including medical applications such as photodynamic therapy.4 They have been incorporated 
both as linkers and connectors in metalorganic frameworks56 (MOFs) and covalentorganic
