. Transition metal (TM) carbonyl complexes are frequently encountered in synthetic 
organometallic chemistry and are cornerstones of modern coordination chemistry. Owing to the 
diverse physicochemical properties and the tunability of their reactivity through modification of 
the metal center, they have numerous industrial1, biochemical2, and catalytic3, 4 applications. Hence, isolated gasphase TM(CO)n models and the chemisorption of CO on metal surfaces are 
often investigated to shed light on their catalytic potencies.59 
The fact that the dominant binding mode of CO with electropositive metals is via the less 
electronegative C rather than the more electronegative O is at first glance surprising.10 This unique 
characteristic of CO arises from the twoelectron s lone pair present on the C, making it the 
strongest ligand in the spectrochemical series.
