Description:
Produced as a byproduct in CO2 electroreduction processes.

However, the stability of copper electrocatalysts is very poor  at 
51 
most in the range of hundreds of hours  which is orders of magnitude lower than the timescales of 
52 
industrial significance for comparative catalyst technologies, which exceeds 30 000 h20. Studies have 
53 
recently highlighted that this critical issue remains unresolved to date20. 54 
The rapid degradation of copperbased cathodic catalysts under CO2 ER affects their activity, selectivity 
55 
and overall performance22. The selectivity towards CO2reduced products lowers over time and hydrogen
