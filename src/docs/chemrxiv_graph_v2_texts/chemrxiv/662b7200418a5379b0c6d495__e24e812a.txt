Description:
A starting point for constructing novel tetragonal carbon allotrope C5.

Text:
However, such pentacarbon should be unstable because it has 
some negative elastic constants. Later, in 2020, cubic pentadiamond was reported as a novel 
allotrope with mechanical properties close to diamond, but the paper was retracted due to serious 
errors in the optimized structure of pentadiamond under mechanical deformation admitted by 
the authors themselves 9. Such interest in 5 allotropes with mixed carbon hybridization arises 
from the possible change of the electronic structure of insulating diamond, leading to metallic
like behavior with potential applications in electronics 10. In the present work, starting from tetC4 5, we construct novel tetragonal carbon allotrope C5 
by crystal chemistry modifications followed by full geometry relaxations using calculations 
based on the quantum mechanics density functional theory DFT 11,12.
