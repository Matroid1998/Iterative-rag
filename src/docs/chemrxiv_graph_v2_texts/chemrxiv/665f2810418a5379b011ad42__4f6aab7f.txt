The urgent global shift towards sustainable energy systems necessitates advancements in 
energy storage technologies, particularly in the face of dwindling nonrenewable fossil fuel 
resources and escalating energy demands.1 Lithiumion batteries (LIBs), which currently 
dominate the commercial battery market, are approaching their theoretical limits in energy 
density, typically ranging from 100 to 265 Wh kg1.2 This limitation has spurred research 
into alternative highenergydensity systems, notably lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries, 
recognized for their potential ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2500 Wh kg1 and 
environmental advantages.3 However, LiS technologies face significant challenges, such as 
the shuttle effect due to polysulfide dissolution and dendrite growth on lithium metal anodes, 
which hinder their practical application.4 On the anode front, siliconbased materials are 
considered a prime candidate for highenergydensity batteries due to their impressive 
capacity of 3579 mA h g1, second only to lithium metal.
