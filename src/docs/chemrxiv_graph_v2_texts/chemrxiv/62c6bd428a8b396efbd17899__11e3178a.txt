questions
remain about the molecular mechanism of this process
and whether it is possible to increase its oxidative
stability by carefully tuning the electron density of the
quinones. In the presence of oxygen (O2), it is observed
that there is a loss in CO2 capture ability17 as reduced
quinones can be reoxidised while O2 is reduced.18 If
quinone structures are tuned to have sufficiently positive
reduction potentials by substitution of functional groups
on the aromatic rings, it may be possible to avoid the
sidereactions with O2. However, by tuning the redox
potentials, one will also change the CO2 capturing
