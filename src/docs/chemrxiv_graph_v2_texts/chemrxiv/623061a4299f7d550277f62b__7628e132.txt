Description:
A protective group that can be removed by electrochemically generated acid.

Text:
In our case we proved 
the deprotection of terButhyloxycarbonyl, (Boc) groups from an 
APTES monolayer grafted on a glass surface upstanding to the 
electrodes in the cell of the WE. This kind of reactions added a proof 
of the activity of electrochemically generated acid, which in 
traditional chemistry is obtained after using high acid concentrations. Results and Discussion
