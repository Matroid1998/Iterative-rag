Description:
Products of the solvent-free mechanochemical Knoevenagel reaction with high yields.

Text:
In this study, we demonstrate that the solventfree 
mechanochemical procedure of the Knoevenagel reaction yields hemiindigos, hemithioindigos, and oxindoles in high yields, requires 
short reaction times, and tolerates a wide scope of reagents. The reaction is selective in regards to the doublebond stereochemistry 
and allows for stereoselective synthesis of multichromophoric and complex macrocyclic derivatives. The photophysical properties of 
selected new products are also reported.
