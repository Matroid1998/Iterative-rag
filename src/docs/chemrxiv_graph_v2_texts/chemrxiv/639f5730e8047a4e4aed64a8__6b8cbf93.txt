Description:
Used as a support material in multiwalled carbon nanotubes for catalytic applications.

This work did not receive much attention until 
recently when the Wang9 and Robert10 groups separately reported improved FEMeOH with CoPc 
deposited on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In the paper from the Robert group, it 
was emphasized that only small amount of methanol could be obtained from CO2RR, while larger 
amount could be generated from CO reduction reaction (CORR). In stark contrast, the Wang group 
claimed that a FEMeOH as high as 44 could be obtained with CoPc deposited on MWCNT. However, most studies have been unable to obtain the improved FEMeOH observed by the Wang 
group, instead finding CO to be the prevailing product even with monodispersed CoPc1115.
