have demonstrated its ap
plicability to a multitude of systems, including carbon diox
ide, nalkanes, and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ethers, for
a wide variety of conditions.18 As demonstrated by Yeh
and Hummer, determining true system size independent self
diffusion coefcients D0 from MD simulations with PBCs re
quire either the knowledge of the shear viscosity, or a series
of MD simulations with varying box lengths.17
Recently, we have shown, that this problem can be turned
on its head, and even be transformed into an alternative ap
proach for determining system size independent transport
properties by performing MD simulations of orthorhombic
systems with magic box length ratios of LzLx LzLy 
2.7933596497, the effect of the hydrodynamic interactions
on the diffusion in x and ydirection cancel out each other,
and the selfdiffusion coefcients Dx and Dy in x and y
direction always represent the true system size independent
selfdiffusion coefcient D0  (Dx  Dy)2.
