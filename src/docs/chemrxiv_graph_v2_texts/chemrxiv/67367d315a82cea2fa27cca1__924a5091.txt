Description:
A product of ethylene glycol oxidation.

Text:
Ethylene glycol is a widely and diversely utilized com
pound in chemical industry with a global production of
57 million metric tons in 20221, applications of which
range from automotive to pharmaceutical. Recently, at
tention has been drawn to its role as sustainable feed
stock for numerous chemical processes, including, among
others, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and antifreeze
production, and in textile industry2,3. Furthermore, the
selective oxidation of ethylene glycol to produce value
added products holds great promise for the development
of ecologically friendly and economically viable processes. Depending on the reaction conditions and the nature of
the used catalyst, oxidation of ethylene glycol can yield
a variety of products, including glycolaldehyde, glycolic
acid, glyoxylic acid, glyoxal, oxalic acid, formic acid, and
even fully oxidized carbon dioxide.

Description:
Formed from the oxidation of ethylene glycol on silver cluster catalysts.

Text:
Several computational studies have been published. Salaev and coworkers8 studied the oxidation of ethy
lene glycol on silver cluster catalysts. Their findings
suggested that ethylene glycol undergoes oxidation to
glyoxal when oxygen species are adsorbed on bridge sites
of the Ag cluster. Partial oxidation to ethylenedioxy
