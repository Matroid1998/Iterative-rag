Description:
Forms bridges in peptides and proteins.

Text:
Photo physical properties of ruthenium complexes are much attention in 
recent years for its wide application is the study of electron transfer1,2, molecular 
assemblies3,4 and amide bridges containing peptides and proteins. groups5,6. A key feature of 
these applications is the electron distribution of ruthenium complexes measured by its acid 
dissociation constants of the ground and excited states.
