However, even though many different 
polymeric nanocomposites have been produced, only a few have been used in extrusionbased 3D 
printing13,24,27 and even fewer with vat photopolymerization methods.14,28 One of the main 
challenges in printing composites with vat photopolymerization is the difficulty in formulating 
homogeneous photoresins. In many cases, increasing the nanofiller loading can result in phase 
separation, agglomeration, voids, and high viscosities.16 Thus, it is essential to develop new 
methods to produce photoprintable composite resins that avoid these issues. Kevlar fibers formed from poly(paraphenylene terephthalamide), commonly known as aramid 
nanofibers (ANFs), are a useful nanofiller29 to improve the mechanical properties of polymer 
composites.
