Description:
A metal that forms a chloride salt upon reaction with chlorine.

Text:
These com
putational studies found that Cl preferentially adsorbs
in the threefold hollow positions on Mg(0001) associ
ated with a slight increase in the workfunction. Upon
the operation of a Clion batteries, the metal anode will
be converted to a chloride salt which provides the ther
modynamical driving force for the discharge of a Clion
battery. The energy gain upon this conversion does in
fact represent the driving force in the Clion battery op
eration 5, 6. This means that the adsorption of chlorine
on the metal anode does only correspond to the first step
in the anode conversion upon discharge.
