Description:
An industrially compostable polymer used in products like drinking straws.

Text:
We exposed 
54 
commercial drinking straws made of cellulose diacetate (CDA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), 
55 
coated and uncoated paper, industriallycompostable polylactic acid (PLA), and PP to marine 
56 
microbes in a flowthrough seawater mesocosm for 16 weeks. Throughout the experiment, we 
57 
measured the mass loss of the straws and collected biofilms from the straws at the end of 16 
58 
weeks for microbial community analyses. 59
