Description:
Commonly used as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries with a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh/g.

The demand for efficient energy storage for electronic devices and electric 
vehicles, like long cycle life and high energy densities, are continually increasing. Lithiumion batteries (LIBs) play a key role in this field. However, it remains a great 
challenge to design LIBs with ever higher capacity and stable cycle life.1,2 Limited 
by the theoretical capacity of commonly used anodes (e.g., graphite 372 mAhg1), is 
is difficult to meet the increasing application requirements. Siliconbased anode 
materials attract widespread research interest due to silicons high theoretical capacity 
(3579 mAhg1), which is much higher than commercialized graphite anodes.3 The 
main obstacle of implementing silicon anodes into applications is the volume expansion 
during the charging and discharging processes (e.g. about 400). This causes serious
