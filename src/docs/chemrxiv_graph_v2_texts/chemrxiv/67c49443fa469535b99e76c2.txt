Organic chromophores, including fluorescent proteins, and
organic fluorophores, have emerged as vital components in
a wide range of applications, such as organic solar cells 13,
lightemitting diodes (LEDs)46, photodetectors79, and bio
logical imaging and sensing10,11. These chromophores play
a crucial role in harvesting and converting light energy into
electrical signals, owing to their unique optical and electronic
properties1214. However, a significant challenge associated with organic
chromophores is their susceptibility to photonoxidation and
subsequent photobleaching, which can lead to degradation of
their performance and hinder overall device efficiency1517. Photobleaching, primarily caused by the interaction between
excited triplet states of dye molecules and atmospheric triplet
oxygen, can significantly reduce the effectiveness of dyes in
longterm applications.
