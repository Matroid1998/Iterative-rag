Description:
A conjugated polymer prepared using direct CH arylation.

Owing to these disadvantages, recent advancements in 
the direct CH arylation are emerging as a promising method for polymerization because of 
its higher atom efficiency, fewer synthetic steps, and environmentally friendly nature.5 As a 
result of this, CH arylation is extensively investigated to prepare welldefined conjugated 
polymers based on various aryl building blocks, including polyProDOT.6 Direct CH arylation 
polymerization involves the coupling of an aryl CH with an aryl halide. Therefore, the use of
