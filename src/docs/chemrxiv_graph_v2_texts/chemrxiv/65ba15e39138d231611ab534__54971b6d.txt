Description:
A chemical used in the robust and efficient synthesis of nucleic acids.

Text:
Large synthetic nucleic acid libraries are becoming increasingly critical to many fields of research. Originally largely 
confined to DNA microarrays for transcriptome analysis and genotyping, emerging applications in synthetic 
biology, nanobiotechnology, nucleic acid therapeutics, and information technology (i.e., storage of digital data in 
DNA15) require inexpensive ondemand synthesis not just of DNA, but also of RNA, chemically modified 
nucleosides (sugar, nucleobase or backbone modifications), and oligonucleotides incorporating structural 
modifiers, fluorescent or affinity labels, and degenerate nucleobases. The chemical synthesis of nucleic acids is 
based on the robust and efficient phosphoramidite chemistry developed by Caruthers and Beaucage67.

Description:
Building blocks used in the automated synthesis of nucleic acids.

Text:
The ability 
to easily synthesize nucleic acids provided by this chemistry is among the most important advances in biological 
chemistry of the last century and constitutes a core technology underlying much of modern biological research. Consisting of repeated cycles containing coupling, oxidation, and deblocking steps, the chemistry allows for fully 
automated synthesis using phosphoramidite building blocks. The shared chemistry allows most nucleic acids to be 
synthesized using similar cycles, and for different nucleic acid types to be combined within an oligonucleotide to 
yield, for example, DNARNA chimeric sequences, or oligonucleotides labeled via fluorescent phosphoramidites.
