Description:
Formed at the anode from ammonia molecules in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte.

1 AOR for
treating ammonia in wastewater poses many benefits over
current methods because it requires less energy, does not
produce NOx gases, and is more costeffective than typical
bacterial degradation. 1,14,15
The utility of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in an aque
ous alkaline electrolyte stems from the conversion of ammo
nia molecules into dinitrogen, water, and electrons at the
anode Eq. 1, and the reduction of water to form hydroxide
ions and hydrogen at the cathode Eq. 2. 1,16
Anode 2NH3(g)6OH(aq) N2(g)6H2O(l)6e(1)
Cathode 6H2O(l)  6e6OH(aq)  3H2(g)
(2)
Overall 2NH3(g) N2(g)  3H2(g)
(3)
This is the inverse of the well known electrochemical nitro
gen reduction reaction (NRR), a sustainable alternative for
ammonia synthesis without the high pressure and temper
ature demands of the HaberBosch process.

Description:
Formed from the oxidation of ammonia in solid oxide fuel cells.

Text:
6,17 AOR has
several practical usecases such as ammonia as a fuel for
solid oxide fuel cells, where ammonia is oxidized into hy
drogen and dinitrogen, then hydrogen oxidized to water. 18
Another implementation, which we will focus on, is het
erogeneously electrocatalyzed AOR at ambient conditions
using an alkaline aqueous electrolyte. 5,6 While promising
for various applications, industrial implementation of AOR
is limited by the current electrocatalysts facing a range of
drawbacks including sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials,
catalyst poisoning, and high costs. 1,19
An experimental study by De Vooys et al. investigated
AOR on transition metal surfaces, showing steadystate ac
tivity towards selective N2(g) formation on Pt and Ir, while
other metals showed transient N2(g) formation at best.
