Natural products, particularly those derived from medicinal plants, have garnered significant attention due 
to their diverse bioactive compounds, lower toxicity, and potential for novel mechanisms of action. One 
such plant is Ginger (Zingiber officinale), a widely recognized herbaceous plant, has been 
utilized for centuries both as a spice and in traditional medicine. Its rhizome is commonly used 
as a natural remedy to relieve ailments such as pain, nausea, and vomiting 6. Numerous 
randomized clinical trials have explored gingers antiemetic properties in contexts like motion 
sickness, pregnancy, and postanesthesia 79. To date, researchers have identified and isolated 
more than 100 compounds from ginger 10. Its nonvolatile components include gingerols, 
shogaols, and paradols, with gingerols and shogaols being particularly abundant 11. Among 
them, 6gingerol (Figure.

as anticancer activities 1214. This study investigates the activity of 6gingerol against key Candida albicans fungal proteins involved in 
specific biological functions, including Sterol 14alpha demethylase, which is responsible for sterol 
biosynthesis 15; Nmyristoyltransferase, essential for protein biosynthesis 16; Aspartic protease, a 
virulence factor 17; Geranylgeranyltransferase type1 subunit alpha, critical for metabolite synthesis 
18; and Dihydrofolate reductase, also involved in metabolite synthesis 19. By interfering with
