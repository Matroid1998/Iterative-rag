A major greenhouse gas causing climate change and global warming.

Text:
Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas causing climate change and global warming. 1About 80 
of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions stem from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and 
natural gas).2 Currently, ca. 40 Gtons of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere annually. Therefore, 
there is a significant interest in developing carboncapture technologies to separate CO2 from flue 
gases, and from air. To make a significant impact on climate change, carbon capture will likely 
need to be applied at the gigaton scale, placing extreme demands on the scalability of a carbon 
capture technology. The most mature CO2 capture technologies use aqueous amine solutions.3 
Amines are suitable to react with CO2 in low concentrations and have a high selectivity for CO2.
