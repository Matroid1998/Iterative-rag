Description:
React with allylboronic esters to form homoallylic derivatives with high enantio and diastereocontrol.

Text:
Allylboronic esters are an important class of compounds used 
in a variety of transformations. Their moderate nucleophilic 
character offers a high functional group tolerance, making 
them ideal for the synthesis of structurally complex 
molecules.1 Allylboronic esters are also commonly used to 
react with aldehydes, ketones and imines to form the 
corresponding homoallylic derivatives with high levels of 
enantio and diastereocontrol.2 Hence, the development of 
new methods allowing a straightforward, sustainable and 
ideally inexpensive access to these compounds is of great 
importance.
