delivers mixtures of nitrate esters.24 The main challenge for the present study, as outlined 
in Table 1B, was to identify an NO2 donor reagent that is capable of reacting at N rather 
than O without altering the oxidation state at N. Existing precedent using MHAT chemistry 
in concert with arylnitro compounds (17) illustrates this challenge with FeH based 
methods from this lab25 and Studer.26 In the former case, the reductive conditions proceed 
via Path B (presumably through intermediates 20 and 21) but exhaustive reduction 
delivers amine product 22 whereas the latter case reacts exclusively via Path A (via 18) 
to deliver tertiary alcohol 19.
