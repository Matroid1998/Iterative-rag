Description:
Used in electrodes efficient for CO production.

Text:
Electrocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction can be a promising approach for renewable energy 
production through conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel and such hydrogenation reactions are also 
very important for fundamental chemistry such as CC coupling and CH bond formation 
reactions.13 Among various metals in heterogenous electrocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction, 
Cu has been found as an effective electrocatalyst for CO2 hydrogenation reaction.4 In the case of 
other electrodes, Ti, Fe, Ni, or Ptbased electrodes are found to be promising for hydrogen 
productions5 whereas Ag, Au or Zn based electrodes are efficient for CO productions6,7 and Pb, 
Pd, Au, Cd, In, Sn, or Rubased electrodes favor formate810 productions.
