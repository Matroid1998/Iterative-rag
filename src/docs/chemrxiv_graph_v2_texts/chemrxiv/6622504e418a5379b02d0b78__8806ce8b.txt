Description:
A chemical group added to phosphates in lipid A, contributing to polymyxin resistance.

Text:
Such modifications most commonly involve addition of phosphoethanolamine 
(PEtN) (Scheme 1A) or 4amino4deoxyLarabinose (LAra4N) to the 1 or 4 phosphates8. Lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferases are widely distributed in Gramnegative bacteria, and are 
constitutively expressed in some species, including Neisseria meningitidis9 and Moraxella catarrhalis10, 
that in consequence are intrinsically polymyxinresistant. In others, including Acinetobacter 
baumannii11, acquired polymyxin resistance can arise from upregulation of chromosomal PEtN 
transferases, but in E. coli this has remained rare. In 2015 however, a plasmidborne polymyxin 
resistance determinant, the Mobile Colistin Resistance (MCR)1 PEtN transferase, was identified in 
China in an E. coli isolate of porcine origin12, since when multiple MCR isoforms have been discovered 
in multiple species worldwide13. In E. coli MCR production remains the dominant polymyxin resistance 
mechanism.
