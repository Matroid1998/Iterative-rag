Promising candidates for fast solid ionic conductors.

Text:
Nonoxide chalcogenides are promising candidates for fast solid ionic conductors.1 While
the LiPS system has recently attracted significant attention, its related system, LiPSe,
remained relatively unexplored, most likely due to the rarity of Se as comparison to S. An
advantageous feature of Se is that its NMRactive isotope, 77Se, has a higher natural
abundance (7.6) than 33S (0.8). Additionally, 77Se has a nuclear spin of I  12, resulting
in spectra that are easier to interpret than those of the 33S quadrupolar spin of I  32. Because the structural characteristics of selenium and sulfurcontaining compounds tend
to be similar, meaningful comparisons can be drawn from structural studies, which can
probe mobility on the chalcogenide position.
