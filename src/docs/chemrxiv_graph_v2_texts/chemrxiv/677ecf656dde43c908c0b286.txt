Description:
Has a large atomic radius in cysteine.

Text:
1
Cysteine is unique among the twenty proteogenic amino acids due to the large atomic radius
2
of its sulfur atom and the relative weakness of the corresponding SH bond. This imbues it
3
with remarkable nucleophilicity, facilitating spontaneous reactions even under mild conditions.1
4
The inherent nucleophilicity of a given cysteine is governed by its pKa, a value that implies the
5
favorability of the ionization state of the thiol.
