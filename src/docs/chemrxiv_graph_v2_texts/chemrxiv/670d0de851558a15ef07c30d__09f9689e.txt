Description:
Acts as a support material for catalysts in the selective oxidation of alcohols.

Text:
Lastly, 
butanone, which is of similar use as acetone, is produced through nonoxidative 
dehydrogenation of 2butanol using zinc oxide or copper(II) oxide as catalysts 3. In the research of selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols, the catalyst materials 
studied most in the past cover primarily typical support materials such as TiO2, CeO2, Al2O3 
and Fe2O3 carrying gold, palladium or platinum nanoparticles 47. More recently, oxide 
catalysts have been increasingly focused on, because of lower financial cost and their 
superiority to noble metal based materials in terms of sintering rates, thermal stability and
