Description:
Soluble in THF and involved in nucleophilic addition reactions.

Text:
The expected product 3, 
obtained via nucleophilic addition of pTolMgBr was only 
produced in low yields and could not be isolated from 4 and 5, 
generated by the nucleophilic additions of residual PhLi and 
THFsoluble LiBr, respectively. a. Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, LudwigMaximiliansUniversitt
