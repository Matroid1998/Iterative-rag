Description:
A water-soluble dye used in diagnostic and imaging procedures.

Text:
For more than 60 years, ICG has been used 
clinically for various types of diagnostic and imaging procedures.1 This includes diagnostic 
methods that assess liver function, cardiac output, or blood volume, and imaging methods for 
visualizing choroidal blood flow, revascularized tissue, or exposed tumors during surgery.2 3 4 5 6 
Although ICG is a watersoluble dye, its amphiphilic molecular structure promotes dye self
aggregation at concentrations  5 M or reversible association with hydrophobic sites on 
proteins or membranes.7 Upon intravenous dosing, ICG rapidly binds to blood proteins, especially 
albumin, and within a few minutes it is cleared through the liver as an unchanged molecule and 
excreted into the intestines as a component of the bile juice.

Description:
A compound used in fluorescence imaging with favorable clinical safety due to rapid clearance and deep tissue penetration with near-infrared light.

Text:
The rapid clearance is a major 
reason why the clinical safety record of ICG is quite favorable. The longwavelength nearinfrared 
light used for ICG fluorescence excitation and detection can penetrate relatively deeply through 
skin and tissue because there is negligible absorption by endogenous pigments and reduced 
scattering of the light.

Description:
Known for chemical instability in aqueous solution and moderate susceptibility to photobleaching.

Text:
However, ICG is known for several clinical performance limitations 
including chemical instability in aqueous solution,8 which limits its clinical use to six hours after 
dose reconstitution, and moderate susceptibility to photobleaching.9 In addition, ICG self
aggregation or albumin association means the spectral properties, including fluorescence 
quantum yield and electronic excited state lifetime are concentration dependent.10 Efforts to 
mitigate these drawbacks have included strategies that encapsulate ICG within protective 
nanocapsules such as liposomes, proteins, or hyperbranched polymers.11 There are also 
preclinical and clinical protocols that combine ICG with other fluorescent dyes with different 
wavelengths for multicolor imaging and sensing applications.12 13 14 The feasibility of this 
approach is enhanced by ongoing advances in camera technology that enables advanced 
methods of multicolor and lifetime imaging.15 16 
As part of an ongoing project to develop structural analogues of ICG with customized imaging 
properties, 9 17 we decided to evaluate the pentamethine version of ICG which we call 
Indocyanine Blue (ICB, see Scheme 1).
