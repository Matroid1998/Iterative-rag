Transport properties of fluids in confinement are essential for both biological and arti
2 
ficial systems. Enhancement of diffusion with the preservation of selectivity is essential for the 
3 
improvement of separation technologies1, particularly for membranebased systems.2, 3 In bio
4 
logical systems, diffusion enhancement is primarily facilitated by pore shape agitation of the 
5 
channels embedded in soft matter.48 However, similar effects can also be found in artificial 
6 
porous media such as carbon nanotubes in which phononinduced oscillating friction is found 
7 
to enhance diffusion of fluids.911 In both cases the nanoscopic oscillation of pore contraction 
8 
and expansion propagates cooperatively through the lattice allowing for accelerated transport 
9 
properties on a larger length scale. 10
