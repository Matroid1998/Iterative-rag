Description:
Metal centers in the most active homogeneous water oxidation catalysts.

Text:
Experimental efforts to determine the ligands compatible with water oxidation79 or 
identify design criteria for more active WOCs1014 often consist of trialanderror synthesis of a 
set of TMCs and measurement of their activity.714 This approach has led to significantly 
improved homogeneous WOCs, the most active of which contain Ru metal centers.1516 
However, many of these improved catalysts rely on throughspace interactions1619 such as 
pendant bases1819 to achieve an increase in catalytic activity. Ligand modifications that instead 
improve catalytic activity via throughbond effects are desirable since they are more robust to 
changes in reaction conditions and provide a complementary approach to further increasing 
activity.
