Description:
Organic linkers used in the construction of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

Text:
Porphyrins are excellent organic linkers for the 
construction of MOFs and many different frameworks have been described over the last decades.26,27 
Unfortunately, many of them are prone to hydrolysis28 and are therefore of limited interest for sensing 
applications under ambient conditions. One welldescribed and hydrolytically considerably stable 
porphyrinbased MOF is PCN224.29 PCN224 consists of Zr6 clusters which are connected by 
tetrakis(4carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H2TCPP) as organic linker and is sufficiently insoluble in most 
common solvents as well as hydrolytically stable in a broad pH range (1 to 11). This MOF has a 
permanent porosity with a reported BET surface of 2600 m g1 and large pore sizes of 1.9 nm in
