Description:
A polymer used in temperature-responsive materials for biomedical applications due to its fast temperature-induced phase transition at a lower critical solution temperature of 32Â°C.

The key advantages offered by nanogels are their 
ease of preparation that yields uniform and tuneable sizes, relatively high encapsulation 
efficiency, stability in the presence of serum, and the possibility of simple introduction of 
stimuli responsiveness.6 
To yield high level of control of drug loading and triggered release, temperature andor 
enzymeresponsive motifs can be incorporated in polymerbased drug delivery.7 With respect 
to temperaturetriggered systems, poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) remains one of the 
most studied polymers incorporated in the design of temperatureresponsive materials for 
biomedical applications due to its fast temperatureinduced phase transition at a lower 
critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 C.8,9 Copolymers of PNIPAM with a temperature
independent hydrophilic block allow rapid assembly of nanostructures upon heating either 
after or during the polymerisation because of the thermally induced collapse of the PNIPAM 
block at temperatures above the LCST.10 However, PNIPAMbased nanoassemblies are limited
