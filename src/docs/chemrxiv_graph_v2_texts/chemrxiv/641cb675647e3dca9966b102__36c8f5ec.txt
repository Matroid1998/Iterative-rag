Mechanisticallydriven phosphine ligand design for 
transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling reactions has ena
bled the development of robust methodologies for carboncar
bon and carbonheteroatom bond formation under mild con
ditions with low catalyst loading.1 In SuzukiMiyaura cross
coupling reactions (SMCs), extensive studies of Pdcatalyzed 
methodologies have identified that unsaturated L1Pd interme
diates (where L is a monophosphine ligand) are generally nec
essary to promote the organometallic steps of catalysis.2,3,4,5 
These findings have prompted the design and implementation 
of electronrich and stericallybulky monophosphine ligands to 
preferentially form L1Pd intermediates that promote efficient 
catalysis while protecting against offcycle reactivity (Figure 
1a).6,7,8 While this design principle has been highly enabling for 
Pd, recent efforts to develop analogous Nicatalyzed methodol
ogies have revealed that these ligand design principles do not 
necessarily translate between the two metals.9 Namely, the lig
ands that are most effective for Pd, including bulky trialkyl (e.g., 
P(tBu)3, P(Ad)3), triaryl (e.g., P(otol)3), and highlysubstituted 
dialkylbiaryl phosphines (e.g., tBuBrettPhos) are not simi
larly privileged in Nicatalyzed SMCs.10,11,12,13 
By contrast, bisphosphine ligands like 1,1bis(diphe
nylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) are commonly used in Nicata
lyzed SMCs and have been incorporated into airstable precat
alysts that enable efficient C(sp2)C(sp2) bond formation with 
(hetero)aryl substrates (Figure 1a).14,15,16 A simple rationaliza
tion of the use of bisphosphines over monophosphines in Ni
catalyzed SMCs is that, by virtue of being able to occupy two 
coordination sites in an entropicallyfavorable chelate, these 
ligands can avoid the formation of vacant coordination sites 
that can enable unproductive reactivity.10,17,18 Additionally,
