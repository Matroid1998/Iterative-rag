Benefiting from the widespread commercial availability, lower toxicity, and stability of aliphatic acids, 
27 
the past decades have witnessed a wealth of transitionmetalcatalyzed decarboxylative crosscoupling 
28 
to forge new CC and CX bonds. The high levels of chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance 
29 
exhibited by these reactions have enabled the latestage C(sp3)enriched functional group modification 
30 
and spatial diversification of bioactive molecules and natural products111. A great progress has been 
31 
made in efficiently constructing racemic C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds via transition metal catalyzed 
32 
decarboxylative crosscoupling of aliphatic acids. Various strategies have been developed by groups led 
33 
by MacMillan1215, Baran 11,1619, Fu 20, Weix 21, and Cernak 22 etc., encompassing diverse cross
34 
coupling partners such as alkyl halides, alkenes, alcohols, amines, and even carboxylic acids.
