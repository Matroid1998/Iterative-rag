Description:
A class of neurotransmitters that includes dopamine.

Text:
Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine neurotransmitter, first recognized in the 1950s, and is the major 
neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).1 The dopamine receptors (DR) were first 
characterized as members of the Class A Gproteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily in the 1980s 
and 1990s, and they are subdivided into five subtypes, D15.2,3 The five subtypes are further divided into 
two distinct families (D1like and D2like) based on whether they activate or inhibit adenyl cyclase activity. The D1like family consists of the adenyl cyclase activators D1 and D5, and the D2like family consists of 
the adenyl cyclase inhibitors D2, D3, and D4.3 There is high homology between the dopamine receptors with 
80 homology between the D1like receptors and 75 homology within the D2like family. Although
