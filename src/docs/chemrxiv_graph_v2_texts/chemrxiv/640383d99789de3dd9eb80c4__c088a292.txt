Description:
Involved in phosphorylation processes, with dysregulation linked to diseases such as cancer.

Text:
Many diseases, including cancers, arise from the 
dysregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, and tyrosine phosphatases have been proposed as candidate drug 
targets for the treatment of these diseases.3 For example, the phosphatase PTP1B has been linked to 
diabetes and obesity, as it acts as a negative regulator of the insulin receptor signaling pathway by 
dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrates.4,5 The phosphatase SHP2 has been shown to 
promote oncogenic signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases.6,7 Both of these enzymes have been 
the targets of extensive preclinical drug discovery campaigns, and allosteric inhibitors of SHP2 are currently 
in clinical trials.8,9 Despite their physiological importance, the regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of 
many PTPs remain poorly defined, in part due to the lack of robust chemical tools to selectively inhibit PTPs 
or monitor their activity in cells.10 
Most tyrosine phosphatases have a catalytic cysteine that is directly responsible for substrate 
dephosphorylation.
