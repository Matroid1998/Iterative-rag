Description:
Organic compounds characterized by the hydroxyl group attached to them.

Text:
Water pollution in the environment has become a significant concern due to the toxic nature of phenolic 
derivatives which can adversely affect aquatic life and human health. Phenolic compounds are the organic 
compounds that are characterized by the hydroxyl group attached to them 1. These compounds are widely 
recognized for their presence in industrial effluents and their potential to cause significant environmental harm 
due to their toxicity and persistence in water 2. Phenolic derivatives are significant contributors to water 
pollution, as they are widely used in dye industries which discharge their organic dyes such as Azo dye (which 
contains nitrophenols). These dyes are highly stable, carcinogenic and nonbiodegradable 5.
