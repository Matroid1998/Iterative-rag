Description:
Involved in the shuttle effect that negatively impacts the electrochemical performance of LiS cells.

Text:
Significant research has been undertaken to increase 
the active material loading of LiS cells 6, however this often results in poor 
electrochemical performance due to low sulfur utilisation and an increase in the 
polysulfide shuttle effect 7. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance can be 
improved by the addition of an excessive mass of conductive carbon to the positive 
electrode composite and substrate 8,9. In some instances, as little as 20 wt sulfur 
is incorporated into the positive electrode, resulting in a gravimetric capacity too 
low for practical applications 10. Additionally, most LiS cell research is conducted using coin cells which use a Li 
metal foil as the negative electrode.
