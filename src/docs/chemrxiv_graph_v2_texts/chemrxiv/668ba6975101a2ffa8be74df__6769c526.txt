Involved in hydrogenation reactions.

Yet, 
the computational guided discovery of catalysts has thus far been limited to reactions 
involving small molecules like oxygen electrolysis8, ammonia synthesis9, ammonia 
oxidation10, methane oxidation11, CO and CO2 hydrogenation12,13, C2C3 alkane 
dehydrogenation14,15,16,17, and acetylene semihydrogenation18. Establishing similar 
predictive models for catalytic reactions involving larger molecules as seen in 
dehydrogenating hydrogen carriers is not feasible using the current stateoftheart 
because of four limitations. First, larger reaction intermediates like unsaturated cyclic 
hydrocarbons adsorb across multiple atoms of an active site, with the active sites in 
turn, possessing low symmetry. Second, the diverse structural (e.g., coordination 
numbers) and chemical environments (e.g., composition of first nearest neighbors) 
further complicate accurate predictions of adsorption energies using machine learning 
models that have been otherwise effective for small molecules19.
