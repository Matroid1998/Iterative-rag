Description:
Used as a nanofiller to improve mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of polymer composites.

Text:
When compared to conventional microscale composite fillers, nanocomposite 
reinforcements are especially useful as their smaller size enables a greater interaction area with the 
surrounding polymer matrix, thereby more effectively transferring stress between the filler and the 
matrix.16 The properties of bulk nanocomposites depend on the type of nanoscale filler, and the 
types of interactions that can occur between the polymer matrix and the surface of the fillers. Different types of nanofillers (e.g., cellulose nanocrystals,17 20 carbon nanotubes,2123 graphene 
oxide 2426) have been used to improve mechanical, thermal and electrical properties as well as to 
introduce new functions to the polymer composites.
