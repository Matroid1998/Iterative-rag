Description:
Has the highest specific energy compared to conventional fuels and is used in fuel cells for clean, efficient, and sustainable technology.

Green hydrogen will be essential as a fuel of a defossilized energy economy 1. Compared with conventional fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil, hydrogen
has the highest specic energy 2, and if used in fuel cells it constitutes a clean,
ecient and sustainable technology 3. 5
An already welldeveloped and costeective green technology for hydrogen pro
duction is alkaline water electrolysis, in which hydrogen gas is produced from
the water splitting reaction under alkaline conditions 4. In alkaline electrolyz
ers the anode and the cathode are immersed in highly concentrated alkaline
solutions (e.g., NaOH or KOH).

Description:
Produced in electrolysers with an operating cell voltage between 1.5-2.0 V.

The standard equilibrium
potential of the overall water splitting reaction is 1.23 V. However, the prac
tical operating cell voltage for hydrogen evolution lies between 1.52.0 V. The

additional voltage, also referred to as overvoltage or overpotential, must be ap
plied to overcome the energy barriers of the OER. The overall system eciency
thus remains between 5970  for commercially available electrolysers 5, 6. Improvement of this eciency and increasing the hydrogen production rate are
pivotal practical goals to achieve for this technology. 25
