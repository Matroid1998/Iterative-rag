The 
aromatization of these soluble polyphenylenes is achieved using oxidative 
cyclodehydrogenation to form insoluble nanographene products.18 More recently, oneshot 
annotative extension has been developed as a useful growth from template method to 
selectively modify K, L and bayregions of nanographenes using DielsAlder or CH activation 
chemistry.19,20 These synthetic tools have enabled numerous studies on the effect of 
nanographene size, shape and heteroatoms on the electronic and optical properties of well
defined carbon materials.21,22 
Only a limited number of studies report the optical properties of GNRs.14,2334 Using wet 
chemistry synthetic methods discussed above, several GNRs with 0.52 nm ribbon widths (where
