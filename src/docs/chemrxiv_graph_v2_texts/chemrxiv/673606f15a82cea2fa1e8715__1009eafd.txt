The flexible electron configurations in d or f orbitals in transition metals define new bonding 
patterns which differentiate them from covalent bonds in organic molecules.1,2 Metalligand 
bonding is very complex, with a wide variety of coordination nubmers.3 Moreover, ligandligand 
and metalmetal interactions also pose challenges in the design of organometallic compounds. On 
the other hand, the intricate structural features of organometallic complexes imparts important and 
novel properties to transition metal complexes (TMCs).
