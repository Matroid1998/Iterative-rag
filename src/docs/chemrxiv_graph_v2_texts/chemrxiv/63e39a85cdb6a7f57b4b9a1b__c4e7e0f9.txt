Description:
Used in methanol for deacetylation processes.

Text:
Fortunately, deacetylation using sodium 
methoxide in methanol, followed by lyophilization to obtain 
glycopeptides 2426, and subsequent removal of the tyrosine 
sulfate Np protecting group with 2M ammonium acetate af
forded the desired PSY1 peptides 16Ara1Hyp 2, 16Ara2Hyp 
3, and 16Ara3Hyp 4 in high purity after lyophilization.
