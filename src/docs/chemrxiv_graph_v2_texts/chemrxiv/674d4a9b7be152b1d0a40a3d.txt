Description:
An electronic analogue of tantalum with new synthetic possibilities.

Text:
Organic and inorganic derivatives of tantalum are widely 
used in the synthesis of various classes of organic compounds 1
1819. Modern advances in using VB group metal compounds 
include 
oxidation, 
reduction, 
water 
splitting, 
alkylation, 
dealkylation, polymerization, aromatization, protein synthesis, and 
other reactions 1. We have previously shown that tantalum 
pentachloride can initiate carboaluminations of alkynes with 
organoaluminum compounds 9,10. New synthetic possibilities for 
niobium, an electronic analogue of tantalum, have been discovered 
through the chlorothiolation reaction of 2alkynylamines with 
methanesulfonyl 
chloride 
and 
stoichiometric 
amounts 
of 
niobium(V) chloride in the presence of metallic magnesium 20. It 
has been assumed that the observed transformation is initiated by 
the NbCl4 complex, which is generated as a result of the reduction 
of NbCl5 using metallic magnesium in a toluene solution.

Description:
Forms monomeric coordination complexes that are paramagnetic.

Text:
It is known 
that monomeric coordination complexes of lowvalent niobium, 
such as NbCl4L2, are paramagnetic 21. Another synthetic finding of 
the use of metal compounds from the VB group is presented in this 
study. We have, for the first time, performed a highly selective 
arylation of alkylsubstituted aldehydes using benzene, under the 
action of a system of reagents consisting of TaCl5 and Mg 
.
