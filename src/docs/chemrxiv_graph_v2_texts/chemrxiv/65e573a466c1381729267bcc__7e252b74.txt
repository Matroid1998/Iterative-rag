Description:
A substituent group at the para position on the phenyl ring that did not affect reactivity.

Text:
of a substituent such as methyl (1b), tertbutyl 
(1c), phenyl (1d), or diphenylamino (1e) groups at the pare
position on the phenyl ring did not affect the reactivity, 
affording the desired arylation products (3ba3ea) in moderate 
to good yields (6383). Substrate bearing a methyl group on 
the metaposition (1f) also reacted under the mechanochemical 
conditions to deliver the target product 3fa in high yield (88). Reaction with substrate having a sterically demanding 
substituent such as 2isopropyl group (1g) proceeded smoothly 
to produce the corresponding product (3ga) in good yield (80). We also found that the arylation with polycyclic aryl iodides (1h 
and 1i) was feasible and the desired products (3ha and 3ia) in 
good yields (69 and 85 yields, respectively).
