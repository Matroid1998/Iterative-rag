Description:
Used in quantum sensing applications as a chip with nitrogen-vacancy centers for optical detection of signals.

. LabonaChip (LOC) applications signicantly im
pact physical and life sciences, hinging on the ex
tensive system miniaturization of microuidics, where
benets range from welldened mass and heat trans
port to extensive process parallelization 1. Addition
ally, microuidics can optimize conventional chemi
cal or biological processes 2, enabling applications
in singlecell biology 3, drug discovery 4, organon
achip research 5, 6, or electrochemistry 7. How
ever, analytics and process control in LOC platforms
