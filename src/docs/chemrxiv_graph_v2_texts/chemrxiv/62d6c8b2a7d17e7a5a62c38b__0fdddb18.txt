Description:
Acts as a pillar in the MOF DUT8.

Text:
In MOFs, this condition could
arise from a number of factors as classified by Zhou et
al.11 MOFs with the same component building units but
different conformation (i.e. flexible MOFs),12 interpene
trating structures,13 and MOFs with a specified topology
but consisting of low symmetry building blocks, such that
changing the orientation of the building block will create
another isomer.14, 15

Framework isomerism is interesting to examine in detail,
either considering each individual isomer or collectively, as
it has been found to influence properties such as flexibility
and adsorption.16 Conformational isomerism is reported
to impact the collective flexibility in DUT8, a MOF with
Ni2 paddlewheels, dabco pillars and naphthalene dicarboxy
late (ndc) linkers.
