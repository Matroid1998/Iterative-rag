Description:
Gaseous oxidized mercury formed from Hg(0) that predominantly deposits into oceans.

Text:
The atmosphere transports gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0), GEM) globally, so that this neurotoxic pollutant is found in the 
poles as well as near its emission sources (Schroeder and Munthe, 1998). GEM deposits from the gaseous atmosphere roughly 
equally into vegetation versus oceans, in competition with reacting to form gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), that is, Hg(II) 
(Shah et al., 2021; Zhou and Obrist, 2021). GOM, if not reduced back to GEM (SaizLopez et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2022), will 
20 
deposit predominantly into oceans. The contrasting fates of GEM and GOM means that we need to understand the redox 
chemistry of atmospheric mercury to predict when and where mercury enters ecosystems.
