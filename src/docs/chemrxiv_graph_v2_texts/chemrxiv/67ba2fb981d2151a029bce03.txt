Description:
A stimulus used in smart polymer systems for pollutant removal and water purification.

6 Various smart polymer systems can remove pollutants effectively from water 
using external stimuli, such as pH, CO2, temperature, and light, or a combination of stimuli. Recently, we demonstrated a novel desalination process that combines CO2 capture and 
water purification using CO2responsive organic materials (also see Scheme S1).7 Leveraging 
the high amine density, poly(ethyleneimine) polymers (PEI) mediated CO2 uptake and ion 
exchange sequence. The modified PEI812 successfully sequestrated chloride ion from the 
model and genuine seawater samples (aq. NaCl of 335 gL). A brine solution treated with 
alkylated PEIs generated soda (NaHCO3) and quaternary ammonium chloride on PEIs. Chloride removal was accomplished through decantation of the polymeric sediment.
