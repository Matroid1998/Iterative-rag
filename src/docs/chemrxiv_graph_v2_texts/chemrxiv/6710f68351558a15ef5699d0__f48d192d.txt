Description:
A photocage that operates via bond heterolysis mechanisms.

Text:
However, using photocages in PACT requires that the 
photochemical activation can be achieved noninvasively in 
deeper organ tissues with a limited access to deliver the light 
even with optical fibers. Therefore, the light absorption of 
photocages must reach well into the tissue transparent window 
that opens in the nearinfrared (NIR) region.27 Historically, the 
success of such endeavour remained an open challenge due to 
a widespread assumption that the subpar excitation energy is 
insufficient to directly break covalent bonds. However, the 
introduction 
of 
phydroxyphenacyl 
(pHP)2832 
and 
coumarin30,3335 photocages that operate via bond heterolysis 
mechanisms largely contributed to addressing this conceptual 
obstacle.
