Description:
A reductase overexpressed in hypoxic tumors.

Text:
Hypoxia is a significant feature of most solid tumors,
which is stemmed from the imbalance between the enhanced
oxygen depletion caused by the fast proliferation of tumor
cells and an insufficient oxygen supply arisen arising from
limited neovascularization.1320 Hypoxia is also associated with
tumor
invasion,
metastasis,
increased
resistance
to
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy.21,22
Moreover,
hypoxic
tumors generally display much stronger reducibility than those
normoxic cells due to the overexpression of reductases, such
as
nitroreductase,
azoreductase,
glutathione,
NAD(P)H
quinone oxidoreductase 1 and so on.2327 By virtue of the
intense reductive ability, numerous hypoxia responsive probes
have been created.2830 Among these, azobenzene derivatives
are a kind of classical hypoxiasensitive probes, which can be
reduced to amine derivatives by breaking the azo group using
azoreductase in hypoxic microenvironment.3135 Usually, azo
based luminophores emit weak fluorescence upon excitation
owing
to
the
excited
energy
consumption
by
rapid
intramolecular rotation around the NN double bond.3638
After reduction of the azo group, intense fluorescence is
attained that is the design principle for hypoxiaresponsive
probes.
