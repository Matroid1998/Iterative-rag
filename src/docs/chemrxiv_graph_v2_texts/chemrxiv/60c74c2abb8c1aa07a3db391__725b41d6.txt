Description:
The general formula for an ideal garnet with a cubic structure containing a framework of corner-linked tetrahedra and octahedra.

Over the last few decades, various potential SSEs have
been investigated, including LISICON68, NASICON9, 10, perovskites11, garnet12,
ThioLISICON13, argyrodite14 and antiperovskites15. However, of all the
systems reported, the lithium garnet systems are among the few which
encompass both good electrochemical stability and high room temperature Li
ion conductivity. Hence the garnet solidstate electrolytes are envisaged as
promising candidates for allsolidstate batteries. The ideal garnet has a general formula A3B2C3O12 where A, B and C are 8, 6
and 4 oxygen coordinated metal ions. The garnet has a cubic structure (Ia

3d), which contains a framework of cornerlinked tetrahedra and octahedra
