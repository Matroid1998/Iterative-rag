Description:
A costly material used in electrodes for electrolytic generation of hydrogen with PEM technology.

Text:
Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is an intensely stud
ied process for the mediumterm storage of intermittent, decar
bonized electricity such as solar, wind and tidal energy1,2. Fur
thermore, clean hydrogen could also become a widely used en
ergy vector for heavy transportation, replacing fossil fuels. How
ever, the high cost of platinum electrodes represents one of the
barriers towards the largescale implementation of electrolytic
generation of H2 with the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)
technology3,4.
