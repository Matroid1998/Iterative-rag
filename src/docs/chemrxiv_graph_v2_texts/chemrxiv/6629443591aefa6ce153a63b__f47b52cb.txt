Description:
A dye used in DSSCs that can be functionalized for electron injection.

Numerical modeling of the kinetics of a WSDSPEC 
containing all of these optimized components suggested a 
limiting IPCE of ca. 17 in simulated sunlight.20 In that case, 
the key limiting factors were the spectral overlap of the dye 
with sunlight and the initial electron injection efficiency. The latter was shown to be only about 30 in aqueous buff
ered solutions at pH 6.8,6,21 the optimized pH for water oxi
dation catalysis. In contrast, DSSCs functionalized with the 
ruthenium bipyridyl dye N719, using an acetonitrile elec
trolyte solution with an iodide redox mediator and other ad
ditives, exhibit an electron injection efficiency of ca. 84.22 
However, the injection efficiencies for DSSCs with dyes 
other than N719 are often lower at TiO2 electrodes.
