Description:
Can exist as distinct geometric isomers when a macrocycle with a prochiral center encircles an axle with distinguishable ends.

Early in the development of the chemistry of the mechanical 
bond,1 Schill recognized that when a macrocycle containing 
a prochiral center such that its faces are distinguishable en
circles an axle with distinguishable ends, the rotaxane can 
exist as distinct geometric isomers even though the individ
ual components are stereochemically trivial.2 Although mol
ecules that correspond to the type 13 mechanical geometric 
isomers (MGI1) of rotaxanes have been reported, the vast 
majority where the mechanical bond provides the sole ste
reogenic unit4 are constructed from calixarenes5,6 or similar 
macrocycles7 whose facial dissymmetry arises from the 
fixed coneshaped conformation of the threaded ring.8 In 
these cases, facial dissymmetry is expressed over the whole 
macrocycle, which has been shown to lead to stereoselec
tive formation of the corresponding rotaxanes.
