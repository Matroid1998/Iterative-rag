Description:
Used in the preparation of highly oriented 3CSiC via laser.

Text:
Similarly, with C3H8 as carbon source, the growth at T  1200 , ptot  
4 kPa, was highly 111oriented, but switches to 110 at elevated temperatures7,9. No 
explanation for these changes in preferred growth orientation was suggested in these studies. Highly 111oriented 3CSiC has also been prepared with hexamethyldisilane via laser
