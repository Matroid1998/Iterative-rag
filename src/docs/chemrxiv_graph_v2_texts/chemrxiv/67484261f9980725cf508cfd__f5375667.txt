Description:
Substrates that stabilize boryl radical species and demonstrate opposite regioselectivity at the radical addition step.

Text:
The latter intermediate can get halogen from 
the reaction media by the halogen atom transfer (XAT) 
process, with simultaneous propagation of the reaction 
chain.915 Alternatively, radicalpolar crossover (RPC) 
reaction can occur at certain conditions with generation 
of either cationic16,17 or anionic16,18,19 intermediates, 
eventually leading to the formation of the target 
addition products. In this case, it was demonstrated that 
1,2migration from the boron substituent often plays a 
crucial role in the overall reaction outcome.20 
Substrates with substituents stabilizing boryl 
radical species (e.g., styryl boronates or alkenyl 
trifluoroborates) demonstrate an opposite regioselecti
vity at the radical addition step (Scheme 1, B). The 
resulting 
intermediate 
undergoes 
oneelectron 
oxidation through a SET mechanism.
