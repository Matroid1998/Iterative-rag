Description:
Involved in the interconversion with CO catalyzed by CODH.

Text:
As compared to inorganic materials or molecular catalysts, 26 natures 
enzymes such as the nickel containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) is a biocatalyst 
that catalyses the interconversion between CO2 and CO with excellent selectivity and efficiency, 
thereby motivating studies of its biotechnological application. 68 The fusion of photosensitizers 
and biocatalysts to facilitate photocatalysis, called photobiocatalysis (also known as semiartificial 
photosynthesis or biohybrid photocatalysis), 912 has recently gained increased attention, as it opens
