Description:
Used in the generation of Tipromoted olefin polymerization catalysts.

Text:
This feature has 
been successfully used to generate a class of Tipro
moted olefin polymerization catalysts89 and Ni or Copro
moted hydrogenation catalysts.10 
Highvalent states of late transition metal complexes 
are implicated as reactive intermediates in numerous syn
thetic and biological processes; isolation and characteri
zation of such species is of great interest.1112 In this con
text, the coordination of PNs to late transition metals as 
multielectron donors may be expected to stabilize high va
lent states of these metal ions.
