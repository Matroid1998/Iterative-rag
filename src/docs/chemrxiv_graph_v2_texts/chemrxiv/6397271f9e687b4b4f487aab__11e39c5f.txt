A special class of metal oxide polyanion clusters bridged by oxygen atoms with adjustable structures and tunable compositions.

are excellent for catalyzing, electrocatalyzing, andor 
photocatalyzing oxidation reactions. Of these compounds, 
polyoxometalates (POMs) are of particular interest to us. They are a special class of metal (e.g., VV, MoV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, 
and WVI) oxide polyanion clusters bridged by oxygen atoms 
that form welldefined cluster frameworks with adjustable 
structures and tunable compositions.10,11 An enormous 
variety of wellcharacterized polyoxometalates exists and 
many of these can catalyze oxidation reactions, but, they 
often fall short as catalysts for reduction reactions. 1216 
In principle, onetoone sulfurforoxygen analogues of 
POMs, i.e. polythiometalates (PTMs), ought to be 
synthetically accessible.
