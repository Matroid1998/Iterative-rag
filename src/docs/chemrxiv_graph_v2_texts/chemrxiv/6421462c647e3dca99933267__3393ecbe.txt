Description:
A solvent commonly used with Grignard reagents.

However, these approaches contradict the requirements of 
sustainability. A reduction of the halide concentration leads to 
an increase of the solvent content. Lowering of the cooling 
temperature causes reduced reaction rates and increasing 
operating costs. Some publications refer to changing the solvent 
from the commonly used tetrahydrofuran to the more 
expensive 2methyltetrahydrofuran to minimize the amount of 
Wurtz coupling product.3,4 Considering the principles of green 
chemistry, the use of 2methyltetrahydofuran is favourable, 
since the solvent can be made from renewable raw materials5. But changing the solvent is not only more costintensive but also 
accompanied by a change in the whole reaction system. Since 
Grignard 
reagents 
are 
still 
purchasable 
mostly 
in 
tetrahydrofuran, the use of 2methyltetrahydrofuran is not 
further 
considered 
in 
this 
publication.
