Description:
Produced globally with alkaline water electrolysis using nickel-based cathodes at 80Â°C in 30% KOH.

Solar (or green) hydrogen obtained from water 
electrolysis powered by electricity obtained from renewable 
energy sources is one of the two key energy storage 
technologies 1. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is 
already used to produce approximately 12 of the 55 
million tonnes H2 globally produced every at the surface of 
lowcost nickelbased cathode in electrolysis cells normally 
operated at 80 C in 30 KOH 2. Remarkably, as of late 
2023 the installed capacity of electrolytic hydrogen stood at 
860,000 tonnes for a 1.1 GW installed power 3. Scaling up, in general, is a considerable challenge. The 
anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis has 
long been identified as the key electrolysis technology 
merging the low cost of AWE with the high efficiency of 
proton exchange membrane electrolysis 4.
