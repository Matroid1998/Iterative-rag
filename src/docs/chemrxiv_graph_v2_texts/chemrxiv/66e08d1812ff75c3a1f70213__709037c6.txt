Description:
An insulating compound that requires a greater proportion of conductive additives.

Energy storage devices with improved volumetric and gravimetric energy densities 
beyond Liion batteries are essential to mitigate the effects of climate change 1. One promising candidate is the lithiumsulfur (LiS) chemistry due to its high 
theoretical capacity (1,675 mAh g1) as well as the relative abundance, low cost and 
favourable geographic distribution of sulfur 2,3 compared to materials used in Li
ion positive electrodes. However, while advances in this technology have been 
made, widespread commercialisation has been hampered by a range of challenges. The insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S necessitates a greater proportion of 
conductive additives than is required for Liion batteries. These typically comprise 
around 30 wt of the positive electrode composite, which in turn reduces the 
energy density of the cell 4,5.
