Description:
An electron-rich heteroatom involved in molecular interactions.

Text:
These include (1) the presence of 
electronrich heteroatoms, such as O, N, S, P, etc.12, 19, 2729; (2) intra and inter
molecular interactions, e.g., dipoledipole interactions, n interactions, that can afford 
through space electronic communications16, 19, 30; (3) rigid microenvironment that can 
inhibit the nonradiative relaxation of the chromophore and promote the 
photoluminescence efficiency of the chromophore.3133 Therefore, as one intends to 
design and prepare a new NCLP, it is challenging to simultaneously fulfill all these 
requirements with a single species of monomer. As the first two issues can be realized 
by selecting proper monomers with certain pendants, the rigidity of nonconjugated 
polymers is usually limited due to the relatively high flexibility of main chains, 
especially for vinylbased polymers with CC backbones. In fact, the rigidity of
