Description:
Utilized in storage and isotope separation due to its high gas uptake capacity.

Text:
These unique properties have 
motivated intense MOF and COF research during the past years they allow high gas uptake 
capacities and, thus, application in methane and hydrogen storage.11,12 Coupling these 
properties, intrinsic to porous materials, with molecular functionalities integrated into nodes 
and linkers can yield to multifunctionality selective uptake, CO2 capture13,14, hydrogen 
isotope separation,15,16 as well as switching permeance and selectivity via optical17 or 
electrical18 switching. Catalysis also profits from the presence of large pores and channels, 
which allow transport of reactants and products, and, if coupled with functional groups, turns 
the voids in these materials into selective nanoreactors.19 Even though the IUPAC 
recommendations for nomenclature explicitly specifies that these materials are not necessarily 
crystalline,20 high crystal order is observed for many of them.
