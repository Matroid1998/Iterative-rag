Description:
A product of the solar photon-driven oxygen evolution reaction in water splitting.

Text:
The solar photondriven oxygen evolution reaction (photoOER) is a halfreaction of the 
overall water splitting process, in which four absorbed photons are required to form O2 
2H2O  4h  O2  4H

It is particularly challenging to achieve the high efficiency needed for the overall reaction to be 
energetically sustainable due to its multistep nature.13 Some researchers believe that the 
inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water 
oxidation processes is the root cause of poor efficiency.46 Several critical factors have been 
identified.
