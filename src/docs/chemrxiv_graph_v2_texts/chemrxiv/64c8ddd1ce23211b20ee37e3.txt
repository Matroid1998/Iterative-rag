Description:
An anticoagulant with a lethal dosage LD50 at 58 mg/kg.

Text:
Worldwide rodenticide resistance among rat populations (Rattus, sp) 
have been increasingly detected, most probably due to the intensive use of 
anticoagulants 1, 2 . For instance, resistance to warfarin (lethal dosage LD50 at 58 
mgKg) or coumatetralyl (16.5 mgKg), and both resistance and baitdeath 
association learning when using stronger difenacoum (1.8 mgKg), bromadiolone 
(1.1 mgKg), difethialone (0.56 mgKg), flocoumafen (0.46 mgKg) or brodifacoum 
(0.26 mgKg)3, 4 anticoagulants, have been reported. Together with the 
anticoagulantderived toxic residues found on several offtarget biological species 
1, 3, 57, which may even include humans, genetic resistances constitute one of the 
main actual concerns to the use of actual rodenticide anticoagulants. Future 
anticoagulant rodenticides that could maximize ontarget rat lethality while 
minimizing offtarget ecological impacts would be convenient 8 .
