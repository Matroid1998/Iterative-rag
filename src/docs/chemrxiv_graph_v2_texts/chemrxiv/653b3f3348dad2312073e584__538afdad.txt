Description:
A salicylate that is the active ingredient in aspirin and undergoes hydrolysis to produce salicylic acid and acetic acid.

Background Information 
The active ingredient in aspirin tablets is acetylsalicylic acid, a salicylate. Salicylates are esters of salicylic acid, the 
substance that aspirin owes its antiinflammatory properties to (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid is therefore, along with acetic acid, one of the products of the esterification of salicylic acid with 
acetic anhydride. Once an aspirin tablet is ingested and enters the small intestine, the acetylsalicylic acid undergoes a 
hydrolysis reaction, where acetylsalicylic acid reacts with water to break the ester bond and produce salicylic acid and 
acetic acid, as shown in Figure 1 (Awtry  Loscalzo, 2000, The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998).
