Description:
Complexes that were first reported to emit light in 1987.

Text:
The first report of emission from twocoordinate copper complexes 
came in 1987 and involved copper pyrazole complexes.5 Several other reports have since cited 
M(I)L2 and LM(I)X complexes (L  phosphine, carbene, X  halide, acetylide, aryl, amide) 
emitting strongly in the solid state and in solution.622 This chapter will focus on a subset of 
luminescent Group 11 complexes, i.e. twocoordinate d10 metal complexes, with an emphasis on 
copperbased complexes. More extensive reviews are available for the reader that wants to dig 
deeper into the cMa materials.3,2325 In this chapter we will focus largely on (carbene)M(amide) 
(cMa) complexes, as these have the most promising photophysical properties. The cMa complexes 
will be abbreviated 
 with the identities of the carbene and amide given through the text.
