Description:
A compound with high polarity, low nucleophilicity, and the ability to form hydrogen bonding adducts with donor functionalities.

Text:
The role of TFE in 
this reaction may be rationalized by a unique combination of high 
polarity, low nucleophilicity, and the ability to form Hbonding 
adducts with donor functionalities, aiding in the ring opening 
reaction of the aziridine.2829 The major side reaction pathway under 
optimized conditions was identified as dimer formation by 
competing nucleophilic attack of the aziridine. The ratio between 
the desired product and dimer is critically influenced by the 
protonation equilibrium of the aziridine and nucleophile (see SI for 
a comparison of nucleophiles with varying pKa). The direct reaction 
between His 10 and aziridine 9 was hampered by extensive dimer 
formation due to an insufficient pKa difference.
