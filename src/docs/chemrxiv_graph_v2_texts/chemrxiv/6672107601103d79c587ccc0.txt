Description:
An element involved in isotope separation processes.

Text:
Lithium penetration into solid electrolytes (termed Li intrusion) limits charging rate and poses 
safety concerns in solidstate batteries1,2 as well as in electrolysis cells for extracting lithium 
metal3,4 and separating hydrogen isotopes5. In brittle garnet solid electrolytes, mechanical 
imperfection in solid electrolytes is a key cause of Li intrusions, including surface defects such 
as nanoscale cracks69 and internal defects such as voids and grain boundaries1015.
