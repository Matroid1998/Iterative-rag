Description:
A material where band inversion leads to highly-corrugated Fermi surfaces with multiple carrier pockets near the band edge.

Engineering high valley degeneracy is a common design strat
egy for achieving high thermoelectric performance, as it en
ables high electrical conductivity while simultaneously maintain
ing high thermopower.16 In the absence of intervalley scattering,
the thermoelectric quality factor, which determines the maximum
thermoelectric gure of merit zT, is directly proportional to the
valley degeneracy NV .7 Improving zT by increasing the valley de
generacy has been a focus of many studies; for example, converg
ing the valence bands of PbTe at the Lpoint (NV  4) and along
the line (NV  12) has been shown to improve the thermoelec
tric performance of ptype PbTe.813
Recently, nontrivial electronic structure topologies have also at
tracted interest as a strategy for increasing the valley degeneracy
in materials such as rocksalt SnSe,14,15 PbTeSnTeGeTe alloys,16
and Bi2Te3.1719 In these systems, it is often discussed that band
inversion leads to highlycorrugated Fermi surfaces with multiple
carrier pockets near the band edge.
