Description:
A gas enriched in the para spin isomer used in the generation of nuclear hyperpolarization.

Long
lived nuclear singlet order plays a central role in the gen
eration of nuclear hyperpolarization from hydrogen gas
enriched in the para spin isomer4459. The
relaxation
mechanisms
of
LLS
have
been
extensively
studied3,6,15,6071. Most
attention
has
been given to the dipoledipole (DD), chemical shift
anisotropy (CSA) and random eld relaxation mecha
nisms3,6,60,61,64,68. More unusual relaxation mechanisms
such as nuclear spinrotation and scalar relaxation of the
second kind have also been identied4,15,6567,69. Gen
erally speaking, the eciency of a relaxation mechanism
is roughly proportional to the rotational correlation time
c for the random tumbling of the molecules in solution. This suggests that small molecules, which tumble more
rapidly in solution and have small values of c, tend to
have the longest LLS lifetimes.
