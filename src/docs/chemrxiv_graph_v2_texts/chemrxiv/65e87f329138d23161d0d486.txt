Description:
Rare earth ions that can be moved between bulk liquid and liquid-vapor interface using X-rays.

Text:
Control over this transport, from bulk to interface and 
46 
back, can lead to the triggering of interfacial processes as demonstrated by electrochemical methods 
47 
for the liquidliquid interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions.12,13 Here, we 
48 
demonstrate that exposure to Xrays provides a method to move rare earth lanthanide ions between 
49 
bulk liquid and its liquidvapor interface. This method utilizes complexants and extractants like those 
50 
used in solvent extraction processes to separate and purify lanthanides and actinides.

Description:
Extracted into the organic phase during separation processes involving complexants like DTPA.

Text:
This has been used to 
61 
advance the separation of actinides and lanthanides, where complexants such as DTPA hold back 
62 
actinides in the aqueous phase while lanthanides are extracted into the organic phase.21,22 
63 
The competing effects of extractants and complexants contribute to the equilibrium 
64 
distribution of ions in bulk and interfacial liquids.
