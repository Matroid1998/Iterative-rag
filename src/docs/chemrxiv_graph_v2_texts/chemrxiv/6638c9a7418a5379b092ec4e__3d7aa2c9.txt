Description:
A phase that adopts a superstructure of the TiNiSi type featuring GeGe dumbbells due to valence electron shortage.

67 Thus, 
another one valence electron short phase, CaAgGe (7 ve f.u) adopts 
instead a superstructure of the TiNiSi type, which features GeGe 
dumbbells in response to the valence electron shortage.8 Previously, 
aliovalent Ag for Mg partial substitutions were attempted to 
understand the influence of the VEC on the stability of the latest 
system, in particular regarding the occurrence of the superstructure. However, only a modest 13 Ag could be inserted in the Mg position 
to yield the hole doped CaMg1xAgxGe system, while retaining the 
TiNiSi type structure.9 The limited miscibility range of the pseudo
ternary CaMg1xAgxGe system, as experimentally observed, may be 
due to the atomic size mismatch between Mg (1. 60 ) and Ag (1.44 
).
