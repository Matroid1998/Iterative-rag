Description:
Sheets within graphite that have strong covalently bonded carbon atoms forming a network of honeycombs in each layer.

Since the commercialization of rechargeable lithiumion batteries
(LIBs) in 1991, they have become the ubiquitous power sources
for portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and grid elec
tricity storage. Over the past three decades, extensive research
efforts have been invested to develop new generations of cath
ode and anode materials with enhanced cycling performance. Nonetheless, graphite is still the dominant anode for commercial
LIBs because of its superior reversibility of Li deintercalation
and low cost.1,2 Graphite is a layered material consisting of
graphene sheets, which have strong covalently bonded carbon
atoms forming a network of honeycombs in each layer. The bind
ing forces between each layer arise from weak dispersion or van
der Waals (vdW) interactions, enabling the intercalation of ionic
and molecular species.

Description:
Layers that glide with respect to each other upon Li intercalation, changing symmetry.

Text:
Upon Li intercalation, the vdW interac
tions are screened, and the graphene layers glide with respect to
each other, resulting in a symmetry change from an AB stacking
(see Figure 1b) in graphite (C6) to an AA stacking (see Figure
