Description:
An element isolated after the preparation of thiocyanate compounds.

Text:
NCS
was first prepared and isolated by Porrett in 1814, well before
the isolation of elemental bromine, fluorine and iodine.8,9 In
this pioneering work, Porrett used HNCS to prepare sulferetted
chyazate salts of a number of elements, including K, Na, Ca,
Al, Ba, Sr, Ag, Hg, Cu, Pb, Sn, Bi, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, Pd, U, Mo and
Cr.8 Porretts work highlights not only the diversity of thiocyanate
chemistry but also how much is yet to be determined about metal
thiocyanate chemistry although these compounds were reported
more than two hundred years ago, the synthesis and structures of
Pd, U, Mo, Al and Cr thiocyanate have not been confirmed.
