Description:
Used in stoichiometric quantities to mediate selective reactions of CH bonds in sp3-rich scaffolds.

Text:
Palladiummediated CH functionalisation reactions provide a powerful approach for selective 
transformation of individual CH bonds on sp3rich scaffolds.1 Given the increasing importance of 
these compounds in medicinal chemistry,2 the ability to selectively introduce novel functionality at 
particular locations in the molecular framework could provide a highly useful tool in drug 
development. Building upon pioneering work on the use of stoichiometric quantities of palladium(II) 
salts to mediate selective reactions of CH bonds in sp3rich scaffolds,3 catalytic reactions employing 
a directing group to coordinate to the palladium(II) catalyst to control the site of reaction have proved 
to be especially effective.45 In most cases, the directing group incorporates one or more heteroatoms 
which can act as ligands for the palladium and deliver it to an adjacent CH bond.
