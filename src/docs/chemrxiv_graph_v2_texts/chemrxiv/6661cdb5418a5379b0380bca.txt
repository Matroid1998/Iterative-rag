Description:
A metal with conductivity comparable to that of a liquid metal formed at high alkali metal concentrations.

Text:
At lower alkali metal concentrations, the
resulting deep blue solutions contain localised solvated
electrons and dielectrons,1,35 which found practical ap
plication as reducing agents for the hydrogenation of aro
matic hydrocarbons within the Birch reduction process.6
At higher concentrations, as the excess electrons become
delocalised, the solution turns into a liquid metal with
a characteristic golden metallic sheen and conductivity
comparable to that of copper.1,4,5
Models of the nonmetaltometal transition in liquid
systems go back to the work of Landau and Zeldovich
in the 1940s7 and have been experimentally tested on
supercritical mercury or alkali metals numerous times.8
The emerging picture has been that of a sharp transi
tion occurring around the critical point, at which metal
clusters of sufficient size are formed in the dense super
critical vapour.
