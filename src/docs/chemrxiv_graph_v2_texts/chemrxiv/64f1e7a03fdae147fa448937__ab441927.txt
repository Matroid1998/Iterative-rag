Description:
A substrate used in iron catalytic oxidative couplings requiring carefully tailored chiral catalysts.

Text:
Comparing to the dominating precious metals, the earthabundant iron
metal is much less expensive, and often have less health and environmental impact.4 However, its wide arrange of
formal oxidation states and thus multifarious chemical nature, particularly under the oxidative conditions made the chiral
control of iron catalytic oxidative couplings highly challenging.5 The reported successful cases were relied on naphthol
substrates6, requiring carefully tailored chiral catalysts, where reversible SET
(single electron transfer) and
delocalization of Fesubstrate complex would lead to a depreciation of the enantiopurity6c,6d (Figure 1A). Even more
frustrating is the lack of reliable chiral iron catalysts for asymmetric oxidative coupling between Csp3 H and Csp3 H
bonds. Moreover, most of the sophisticated chiral ligandscatalysts were not easily available7, and their long
development design iterations poses additional challenges8.
