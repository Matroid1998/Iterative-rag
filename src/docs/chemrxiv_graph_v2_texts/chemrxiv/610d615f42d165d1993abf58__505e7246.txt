Description:
A class of well-studied photoswitches that undergo efficient isomerization from their thermodynamically stable form (E) to their metastable form (Z) using ultraviolet light (314 nm).

Light is an ideal external stimulus to promote organic reactions. Photoswitches are a class
of molecules that absorb light and reversibly interconvert between their thermodynamically
stable and metastable forms to create photostationary states. Azobenzenes are a class of
wellstudied photoswitches that undergo ecient isomerization from their thermodynami
cally stable form (i.e., E) to their metastable form (i.e., Z) using ultraviolet light (314 nm).1
The Z E isomerization is promoted with 365 nm light.1 This relatively highenergy
light (e.g., ultraviolet) may promote undesired side reactions that compete with the iso
merization pathway (e.g., electrocyclic ringclosing reactions).
