Description:
Has limitations including instability at high temperatures.

Surface modification is a ubiquitous problem in chemistry 
and materials science. In fields as broadly separated as 
photovoltaics1 and in vitro cell culture,2 it is necessary to treat a 
surface so that it presents a welldefined interface permanently 
covered in a particular functional group. The most wellknown 
technique in this area is selfassembly of alkanethiol and 
alkylsiloxanechlorosilane coating agents to prepare self
assembled monolayers (SAMs) These techniques are effective, 
but have limitations including instability at high temperatures in 
the case of thiols3 and long deposition times. Generally, to use 
selfassembly to make a functionalized surface, it is necessary 
to synthesize and isolate a thiol or silane with the desired 
functional group, requiring a substantial amount of work.
