Description:
A greenhouse gas whose emissions have increased steadily since 1750, contributing to global warming.

Text:
Global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased steadily since 1750, with a significant rise 
between 1970 and 2011 that accounts for almost 50 of the cumulative emissions.1 The rise in global temperature 
at both land and ocean surfaces, more frequent observations of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones2,3 
and heat waves,4 together with the projected increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have 
prompted an increase in international commitment to battle global warming. As a result, the 2015 Paris agreement 
was adopted by almost 200 countries, setting a goal of limiting global warming to less than 1.5C by reducing GHG 
emissions significantly. However, there have been discrepancies in the estimated global carbon budget1,57 and thus, 
uncertainty in the required trajectory for emission reduction.
