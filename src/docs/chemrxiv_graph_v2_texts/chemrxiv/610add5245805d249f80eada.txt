Description:
A transition metal extensively used in organic synthesis for forming CC bonds.

Text:
The formation of CC bonds remains the major synthetic challenge in organic chemistry. The 
use of transition metals in forming the CC bonds was probably the most studied area of 
research in organic synthesis in the last half of the century.1Among the transition metals 
palladium was the most relied one to be used in organic synthesis.

Description:
Compatible with different functional groups and can functionalize sp3, sp2, and sp carbon atoms.

Text:
This reliance made it to 
award the Nobel Prize in 2010 in chemistry on transition metal catalysed crosscoupling 
reactions.2 The palladium sometimes prove to be superior to the others owing to 1) 
compatible with different functional groups 2) it can functionalize all three types sp3, sp2 and 
sp carbon atoms 3) most of the palladium catalyst can tolerate air and moisture, and produces 
desired compounds in reasonably milder reaction conditions.3 Furthermore, palladium shows 
low toxicity and easy to separate from the reaction mixture after the reaction is complete. Fluorenone (2.1) is a cyclopentenone derivatives containing a fivemember ketone fused with 
two benzene rings. When one of the fused benzene ring is substituted by pyridine ring 
compound referred to as azafluorenone (2.2) (Fig. 2.1). Fig.
