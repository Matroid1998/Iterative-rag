Description:
Cyclic compounds featuring C(O)S used in anionic-catalytic ring-opening polymerization to prepare polythioesters.

Text:
Among the increasing wealth of degradable polymers, polythioesters 1 are gaining 
interest because of enhanced mechanical properties compared to their (oxo)ester 
counterparts,2 and as degradable, sustainable materials, 35 including for emerging 
biomedical applications.6 
Polythioesters are typically prepared through anioniccatalytic ringopening 
polymerization (ROP) of thiolactones (featuring cyclic C(O)S).712 Recently, 
the ROP of unstrained thionolactones (cyclic C(S)O) was shown to give 
polythioesters through SO isomerization.13 Only few reports have described the 
synthesis of polythioesters through the cationic ringopening polymerization (CROP) 
of thionolactones (which likewise involves SO isomerization).
