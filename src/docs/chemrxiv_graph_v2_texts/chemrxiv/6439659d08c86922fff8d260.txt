Description:
Doping in metal oxides gives rise to dilute magnetic semiconductors.

Text:
Metal oxides are the basis of a vast range of technologies and are typically subject to defect 
engineering to cater for demands across multiple different applications. For instance, incorporation 
of Sn or Mg into In2O3 leads to n or ptype conductivity1; introducing rare earth elements brings 
about light emission2,3; doping with transition metals like Fe, Co, Cr and Ni gives rise to dilute 
magnetic semiconductors47. Among others, native point defects play a particularly important role 
in metal oxides.8 Compared with extrinsic impurities, native defects are ubiquitously present and 
exert a significant influence on material properties.
