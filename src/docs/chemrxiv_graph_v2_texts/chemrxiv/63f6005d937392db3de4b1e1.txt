Description:
Nonactivated olefins exhibit much lower reactivity and generally require a transition-metal catalyst to engage in reaction with carbonyl compounds.

Text:
The selective formation of carboncarbon bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis1. In this 
respect, the carbonyl group is particularly relevant due to its dual role. It can either react as 
electrophilic component, or serve as a pronucleophile at the carbon in their enolized form to 
react with a broad range of external electrophiles 2 , 3 . In comparison to conventional 
nucleophiles or electrophiles, nonactivated olefins exhibit much lower reactivity and generally 
require a transitionmetal catalyst to engage in reaction with carbonyl compounds4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Over the past decade, the transition from precious metals to catalysts based on earthabundant 
metals made impressive progress, and especially nickel became a powerful tool due to its low
cost and unique reactivity profiles12,13.
