Description:
Catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Text:
Classical electrochemical concepts may invoke band structures and Fermi levels, outer
sphere electron transfer, or electric fields present in Helmholtz layer or ionic double layer at the interface of 
the electrode material and the saltrich solvent, the electrolyte.1316 Recent experimental studies on iridium 
dioxide (IrO2) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, have challenged the classical views 
12, 17, 18. Here we approach further steps towards a new paradigm for the electric potential and pH 
dependence of electrocatalytic reaction rates for a class of technologically relevant electrocatalyst materials.
