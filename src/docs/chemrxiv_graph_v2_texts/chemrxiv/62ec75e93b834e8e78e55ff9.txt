Description:
Cycled at interfaces between current collectors and garnet SSE.

Anodefree cells have also been used to observe lithium 
electrodeposition2832, but these configurations were generally chosen to avoid the challenges of 
probing buried interfaces. Recently, Wang et. al demonstrated that  3 mAh cm2 of Li could be 
cycled at interfaces between current collectors and the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) SSE12. However, these cells operated at relatively low current densities ( 0.3 mA cm2) and required hot 
pressing current collectors onto LLZO at temperatures  900 C for fabrication. Other work has 
investigated anodefree SSBs using the softer Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) SSE13, finding that performance
