Description:
Acts as a substrate in sulfonation reactions, which can generate extreme heat and toxic gases.

Text:
One notable
example is Prontosil which was discovered to have the same active pharmacophore as
sulfanilamide.1 The breakthrough that valuable drugs could be synthesized from
seemingly tangential precursors in the early 1900s led to a proliferation of sulfa drugs
and revolutionized the age of chemotherapeutics.2, 3
Despite the simplicity of the structure of sulfanilamide, the reagents in the conventional
synthesis protocol are often acutely toxic and hazardous according to modern safety
standards. Namely, sulfonation requires the generation of SO2 gas in situ, which
necessitates a great deal of patience in allowing dissolved SO2 to react with the aniline
substrate along with the risk of extreme heat generation and toxic gas evolution. Sulfonation can be conveniently performed with chlorosulfonic acid, but the reagent is
violently reactive with water.

Description:
Does not require protection with an acetamide in this synthesis approach.

Text:
In this experiment, a different synthetic angle was
explored to create sulfanilamide which would be markedly more efficient and safe. This
method involves a Willis reagent which performs SO2 addition through a
O(tertButyl)Nsulfinylhydroxylamine (tBuONSO) intermediate that houses a relatively
stable aqueous thionyl intermediate.4 This eliminates the need to rely on SO2 gas
dissolved in water to nucleophilically attack the substrate, but directly substitutes the
thionyl group onto O(tertbutyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride to form the activate
sulfonation reagent tBuONSO. The next step utilizes a grignard reagent
(4Bis(trimethylsilyl)aminophenylmagnesium), which overall achieves the same effect
as a sulfonation. This further eliminates the need to protect the aniline with an
acetamide. Overall, this approach is drastically different from the standard reaction flow
to synthesize sulfanilamide1.
