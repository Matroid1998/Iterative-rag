Description:
Involved in solar fuel production processes beyond water splitting.

Text:
Hydrogen production via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising path
way towards a clean energy cycle that addresses the sustainable development goals of fossil fuel
reduction in the near future 14. A PEC device produces hydrogen from pure water with zero car
bon emissions employing a solarpowered photoanode and a photocathode for water oxidation and
reduction reactions, respectively 5,6. Research on photoanodes attracts significant research interest
because of their potential in coupling with diversified solar fuel production processes beyond wa
ter splitting, including CO2 and N2 reductions 5,710. A central difficulty for the rational design of
efficient photoanodes is the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, which involves multiple charge
transfer pathways 1116.
