Heavy scaling of DRAM nodes requires unique 
propositions to improve electrical performances 1. Bit 
contact region is one of the most heavily affected regions 
due to the scaling down of DRAM nodes. The resistance 
increases exponentially with smaller critical dimensions 
(CDs) 13. The current junction for BC is made with a 
polycrystalline Si plug, followed by metallic silicidation 
using Ti deposition and rapid thermal annealing 4,5. This 
technique, called poly bit con (PBC) has been the standard 
processstructure for making BCs 47. A. Fundamentals of Metal bit contact (MBC) 
Bit contact forms a crucial part of the DRAM module, 
providing connections to the digit line of the DRAM access 
transistor. This contact has shrunk significantly since 1 
DRAM, thereby creating significant burden for the BC 
resistance.

Description:
Deposited on polysilicon to form silicide.

Text:
The usual BC step consists of four parts 1) 
Deposition of polysilicon on Si structure and 2) Deposition 
of Ti on polysilicon 3) Anneal to form silicide (TiSix) at the 
interface 4) Metal deposition, which connects the contact to 
the digit line. Prior technology nodes used a thick 
Polysilicon as the silicon material for creating the silicide 
and forming the contact 1,2. This Polysilicon occupied 
majority of the contact structure and region. In metal bit 
contact (MBC), the majority of the contact structure is made 
of metal (step 4), instead of traditional polysilicon (step 1) 
structure, which helps lower the overall resistance of the 
contact. This change from majoritypoly to majoritymetal 
is highly disruptive but is necessary to enable low resistance 
contacts at very small dimensions.
