Description:
A ring structure in lasso peptides threaded by the C-terminal tail.

Text:
Lasso peptides involve a 1rotaxane topology with a macrolactam ring 
threaded by the Cterminal tail.8,17 The ring is held in position by sterically bulky residues above 
and below the ring, which act as plugs. The ring in the lasso peptide is connected by an 
isopeptide bond between the Nterminal amino group and the carboxylic acid side chain of an 
aspartate or glutamate, which can be located at positions 7, 8, or 9 of the amino acid sequence 
depending on the specific Lasso peptide. Lasso peptides exhibit unique properties, including 
protease stability, thermostability, and thermal switchability.17 
Computational modeling can provide valuable insight into the dynamics1824 and non
covalent interactions2528 of proteins that govern structurefunction relationships.
