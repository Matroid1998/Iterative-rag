Carbonyl compounds like aldehydes and ketones are important classes of organic 
compounds and are widely used in organic synthesis and the chemical industry. Specifically, the adicarbonyl compounds and their derivatives are important structural 
moieties that have been widely developed their applications in the pharmaceutical 
industry, organic synthesis, radical polymerization, and in the preparation of sustainable 
materials like biobased plastic materials. 13 Selective oxidation of alcohols to 
carbonyl compounds has been recognized as one of the most efficient, important as well 
as challenging transformations both in academic and industry.
