Several complex electrolyte solutions resulting from reactions of Lewis bases 
(Grignard reagents like RMgX or MgR2, X  halide, mostly Cl and R  organic ligand, 
alkyl or aryl) with Lewis acids (such BX3nRn or AlX3nRn, n  1 3) in ethereal solvents 
(mostly THF or glymes) demonstrated reversible Mg depositiondissolution and 
electrochemical windows wider than 3V. A few of these systems were proven as 
promising via experiments with rechargeable Mg battery prototypes.69 The 
electrodes in such cells were usually Mg foil anodes and Chevrel phase cathodes 
(mostly the cluster compound MgxMo6S8, 0x2).10 However, Grignardbased 
electrolytes in ethereal solutions may suffer from low anodic stability and high chemical 
reactivity because of their strong nucleophilic and basic character.
