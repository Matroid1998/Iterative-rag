Description:
A metalsilicon precursor with distinct hydrolysis and polycondensation rates compared to Si(OR)4 under aqueous conditions.

However, there are two major limitations in this method when water is used as a 
solvent.3 First, different metalsilicon precursors (e.g., Si(OR)4 vs. Ti(OR)4 or Si(OR)4 vs. 
RxSi(OR)4x) may have significantly different hydrolysis as well as polycondensation rates 
under aqueous conditions leading to phase separation or heterogeneity. Second, due to high 
surface tension of water, the pore structures of wet gel may collapse during the drying process 
resulting in materials with poor textural properties. To overcome the limitations of the HSG mentioned above, the nonhydrolytic solgel (NHSG) 
can be seen as an alternative method where the solgel processes take place in waterfree 
environments.
