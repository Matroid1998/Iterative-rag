Description:
Show increasing interaction strength with HDEHP with increasing atomic number.

Text:
Dialkyl phosphoric acid extractants have been widely used in LLE of metals, particularly RE 
elements.29 Bis(2ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) preferentially extracts the heavier 
lanthanides in a dimeric form such that there are six phosphate groups coordinating the extracted 
lanthanide in the organic phase.30 Reverse micellar structures are formed in the organic phase after 
extraction of metals with HDEHP.3134 Interfacial studies using vibrational sumfrequency 
generation (VSFG) spectroscopy have shown the importance of hydrogen bonding interactions 
between the phosphate groups and water in stabilizing these micellar structures at the liquidliquid 
interface.10 Peak shifts in VSFG in the phosphate region induced by different lanthanides have 
been attributed to increasing interaction strength between HDEHP and the lanthanides with 
increasing atomic number.35 Interestingly, interfacial Xray scattering and fluorescence results 
suggest a preference for lighter lanthanides at the Gibbs monolayers of HDEHP at the airaqueous 
interface, due to the higher solubility of HDEHP complexes of heavier lanthanides.36 
Waterinsoluble molecules, with longer alkyl tails, are limited to the interface and can plausibly 
provide more information on the ionextractant interactions.
