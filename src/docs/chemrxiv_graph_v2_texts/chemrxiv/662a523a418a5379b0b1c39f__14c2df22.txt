Pivotal experiments by
Boxer and coworkers showed that ketosteroid isomerase ex
erts strong electric fields that correlate with its exceptional cat
alytic rate, emphasizing the paramount importance of electro
static preorganization.1214 Similar results were found in other
enzymes, including dehaloperoxidase A, horse liver alcohol
dehydrogenase and tyrosine kinases.1417 Theoretical studies
have provided a detailed picture of the origin of these electric
fields at the molecular scale.
