Description:
A category of sulfur-containing drugs with distinct chemical properties.

Text:
Sulfur is found in roughly 25 of active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) (Scheme 1A).1 This privilege arises from 
sulfurs ability to exist in a diverse array of structurally 
unique functional groups with distinct chemical properties. Sulfurcontaining drugs generally fall into 10 distinct cate
gories defined by these functional groups and, in turn, their 
biological activities.1c A few notable categories include thi
oethers, sulfoxides, and sulfones with examples of approved 
APIs in each category depicted in Scheme 1A.
