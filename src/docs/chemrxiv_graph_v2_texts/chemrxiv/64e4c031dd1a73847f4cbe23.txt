Description:
Synthesized in highly alkaline hydrazine hydrate in methanolic solutions.

Text:
Austin1 reported that nitrofurazone can be reduced to a glyoxylopropionitrile by means of a reductive fission a 
similar but different reductive fission of nitrofurans has also been reported elsewhere.2 This led Cisak et al.,3 to 
study the reactivity of 5nitrofurfural in alkaline and acidic solutions. In stark contrast to the aforementioned 
reported reactivity of 5nitrofufural in alkaline solutions, almost invariably all the previously reported 
procedures for synthesis of hydrazone 1 have been conducted in highly alkaline hydrazine hydrate in methanolic 
solutions4,5 (Scheme 1). For though Li et al.6 reported that a purum sample of 1 was obtained via a modified 
literature procedure (loc. cit.) the particulars of which was never disclosed, it was not feasible to reproduce such 
findings in this work.
