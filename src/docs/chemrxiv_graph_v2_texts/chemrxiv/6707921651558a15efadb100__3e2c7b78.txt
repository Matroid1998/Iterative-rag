A substrate used in carbon insertion reactions.

of electronwithdrawing groups. This 
approach is applicable to various substrates such as indole, imidazole, indene, and cyclopentadiene, resulting in the desired carbon
inserted products. Insights from insitu spectroscopy and theoretical calculations suggest the involvement of distonic radical cation 
intermediates, facilitating carbonatom migration on the aromatic ring and enabling insertion at different positions. This study expands 
the chemical toolkit for synthesizing polysubstituted (hetero)aromatic compounds and introduces a new concept for singlecarbon 
insertion chemistry. Introduction 
Polysubstituted (hetero)aromatic compounds play a crucial 
role in diverse fields, particularly in pharmaceuticals.18 Ap
proved drugs such as Netupitant, Esomeprazole, Pyridoxine, 
and Opicapone contain benzene and pyridine rings with more 
than three substituents (Figure 1A).
