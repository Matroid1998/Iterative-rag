Description:
Involved in studies of synthons for alkylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation reactions of acyl radicals.

Text:
tButyl phenylcyanoacrylate was synthesized by condensation catalyzed by porous silicate 
quaternary ammonium composite materials 1. It was involved in studies of synthons for 
alkylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation reactions of acyl radicals from benzothiazolines 2. 2 

The acrylate was also reported in catalysis studies of bifunctional 2D Cd(II)based metal
organic framework 3. Conjugate addition of perfluoroarenes to tbutyl 4
methylphenylcyanoacrylate was enabled by an alkoxidehydrosilane system 4. tButyl 
cyanoacrylate polymers have found multiple applications like waterbased ink compositions 
5, preparation of polymer microspheres 6, and positive working radiationsensitive 
composition 7. Earlier we have reported synthesis and styrene copolymerization of a number of alkyl ring
substituted methyl 8, 9, ethyl 10, 11, propyl 12, isopropyl 13, butyl 14, isobutyl 15, 
methoxyethyl 16, and octyl 17 phenylcyanoacrylates.
