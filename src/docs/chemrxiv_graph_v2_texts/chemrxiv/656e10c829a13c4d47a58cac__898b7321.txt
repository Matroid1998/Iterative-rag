Description:
An oxidizing agent used in chemical reactions.

Density functional calculations suggest very interesting properties for
these polymers, including metallic conductivity in certain metal complexes and semiconductivity
in others.2
Some of the natural next questions are to inquire (i) whether other metalloporphyrins M2
and other oxidizing agents could be used instead of Zn2 and K2IrCl6, possibly offering some
advantages, and (ii) how the structural and spectroscopic properties of metalloporphenes M1
compare with those of monomeric metalloporphenes M2. Such a study is hindered both by the
quite high cost of commercial 2 and poor yields of its published syntheses, and by the rather
incomplete and scattered literature information on the properties of parent M2, many of which
are unknown.
