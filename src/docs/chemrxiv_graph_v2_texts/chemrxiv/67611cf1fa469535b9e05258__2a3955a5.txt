Description:
Has a rigid structure, is a good electron acceptor, and has high thermal stability with favorable electro-optical, structural, and mesogenic properties depending on substituents.

Dicarbaclosododecaboranes, or carboranes, (C2B10H12), are threedimensional, icosahedral, 
carbonboron cluster compounds that exhibit threecenter twoelectron bonds, high polarizability 
and aromaticity. The three isomers, ortho (1,2), meta (1,3), and para (1,4)carborane (here 
abbreviated oC, mC and pC, respectively) have two CH bonds that can be substituted. Additionally, CB has a rigid structure, is a good electron acceptor, has high thermal stability and, 
depending on the nature of the substituents on the C positions, favorable electrooptical, structural, 
and mesogenic properties.1 2, 3In particular, orthocarboranebased diads (RoCR) and triads (R
