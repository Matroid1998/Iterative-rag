Metal phosphido compounds are important synthetic intermediates in organophos
13

phorus chemistry 13. Most copper phosphido compounds characterized by Xray crys
14

tallography have oligomeric structures 415 with a few notable exceptions 16, 17. We 
15

have been studying these types of compounds as intermediates in copper catalyzed hy
16

drophosphination 18. During our study, we isolated the novel bridging phosphido 
17

copper cluster, Cu4(PPh2)4(PtBu3)2 (1) and were able to determine its molecular structure 
18

using Xray diffraction (Figure 1). We also demonstrate that 1 is an active hydrophos
19

phination precatalyst. 20

Results and Discussion 
23

Treatment of a THF solution of copper(I) chloride with potassium diphe
24

nylphosphide in the presence of tritertbutylphosphine at 30 C results in the formation 
25

of compound 1 (eq. 1) as determined by single crystal Xray diffraction, 1H, 31P, 13C NMR, 
26

and 31P HMBC NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 can also be synthesized by treatment of 
27

mesitylcopper(I) with diphenylphosphine in the presence of tritertbutylphosphine (eq. 28

2 of 7 

2) or by treatment of Cu(acac)2 with three equivalents of diphenylphosphine in the pres
29

ence of tritertbutylphosphine (eq. 3). The 1H and 31P NMR spectra of products from these 
30

three methods are equivalent. 31
