Description:
A class of stable organic radicals where the unpaired electron is stabilized by steric shielding and delocalisation over the NO bond.

Text:
Nitroxides (aminoxyl radicals) are a class of stable organic 
radicals where the unpaired electron is stabilized by steric 
shielding and delocalisation over the NO bond. 1 The extremely 
long lifetimes of nitroxide radicals render them suitable for various 
applications in spectroscopy, in particular for investigations in 
structural biology. Nitroxides have gained a unique place within 
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy as spin 
labels that can reveal dynamic and structural information in 
biomolecules. 2 Through a process known as sitedirected spin 
labelling (SDSL), nitroxides can be covalently attached to the 
biomolecule of interest, which is then analysed by EPR 
spectroscopy.

Description:
Polarising agents for sensitivity enhancement by dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP).

Text:
3 This approach is especially powerful when 
integrated with the double electronelectron resonance (DEER) 
experiment (also known as pulsed electronelectron double 
resonance, PELDOR), which can extract the interspin distance 
and relative orientation of two paramagnetic centres within a 
biomolecule or biomolecular complex. 2a, 4 Nitroxides also hold a 
firmly established position as polarising agents for sensitivity 
enhancement by dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) in nuclear
