These chiral metal halides have been first reported in 2016 
and investigated for their biological activity by Salah and coworkers.13 The crystal 
structure shows a 0D structural motif made of a layered lamellar structure with a layer 
of disconnected CuCl4 tetrahedra and a bilayer of organic MBA cations.13 However, 
their chiroptical properties have been only investigated in 2020 by Hao.14 Through 
circular dichroism (CD) measurements they showed that the chirality transfer from the 
organic ligand to the inorganic framework led to one of the highest values of the 
absorption anisotropy factor (gCD) to date of the order of 0.06.14 The chiral (MBA)2CuCl4 
has been used as an absorbing layer to prepare a circularly polarized light (CPL) detector 
by creating a heterojunction with a semiconducting singlewalled carbon nanotube 
transport channel, providing a high photoresponsivity of 452 AW, a current response of 
the order of microamperes, and low working voltage down to 0.01 V.14 Further 
investigation on the same material in 2021 confirmed previous results and added the
