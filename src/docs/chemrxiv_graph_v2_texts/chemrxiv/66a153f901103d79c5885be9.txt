Description:
Loss of oxygen is attributed to structural degradation mechanisms in nirich layered oxide cathodes.

Nirich layered oxide cathodes can yield substantial increase in energy density

of solidstate Liion batteries, but they suffer from contact loss, and irreversible

layeredtospinel or disordered rocksaltlike phase transition 18. These structural

degradation mechanisms have been mainly attributed to oxygen loss and outofplane
