Description:
Undergoes epoxidation with increased rates when the density of (SiOH)x increases.

Text:
For example, rates of 1octene 
epoxidation increase 100fold when the density of (SiOH)x increases from 0 to 5 per unit cell within Ti
BEA,5 because the disruption of H2O clusters near Ti active sites greatly increases the entropy of the 
system.5,6 Conversely, glucose isomerization rates are 5  50fold greater in hydrophobic Ti and SnBEA 
than hydrophilic analogues, because H2O colocalized near active sites forms HB structures with glucose 
and decreases the entropy of relevant transition states.20,3335 In both of these examples, the dependence of 
epoxidation and glucose isomerization turnover rates on (SiOH)x density reflect changes in the 
thermodynamic stability of transition states via the H2O structures occluded within the BEA pores.
