Description:
Synthesized using differently substituted nitrile-containing functionalities.

Text:
The carbonitriles lack electrophilic properties and are 
generally activated by the transitionmetalacidbase catalysts towards nucleophilic additions 
and ensuing annulation.6 Many groups have utilized differently substituted nitrilecontaining 
functionalities for the synthesis of arylalkyl ketones, diketones, benzofurans, etc.7 In all such 
reactions the nitrogen atom was not found to be incorporated into the product due to the
