Description:
Forms bonds that can alternately point into forward and backward directions along a sequence.

Text:
First modelled 
by Hofmann and coworkers, these systems can form a 
diverse array of novel helices as reported in a series of in 
silico papers.8,9 Such helices are described as being 
mixed  and have the potential for hydrogen bonds to 
alternately point into forward and backward directions 
along the sequence, in contrast to helices with unidirec
tional hydrogen bonds. Among the various possible 11 
heteromers of aamino acids with higher homologated 
amino acids, a,b and a,ghybrid peptides predominate 
the literature.
