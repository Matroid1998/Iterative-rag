Description:
Forms bonds that are important in regulating condensate formation and guest peptide diffusion.

However, a subsequent experimental study involving 
different peptides and RNA suggested that hydrogen bonds between peptides and RNA may be 
more important than cation interactions in regulating condensate formation and guest peptide 
diffusion19. Niu et al. showed that the ability of peptides to form condensates with RNA is impaired 
when the ability of the side chain to form hydrogen bonds is reduced without altering net charge. These workers observed that replacing Arg with residues resulting from a common post
translational modification, asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), led to a loss of capacity to 
form condensates with RNA. At neutral pH, both the Arg and ADMA side chains bear a net 
positive charge, but the hydrogen bonding capacity of the ADMA residue is lower.
