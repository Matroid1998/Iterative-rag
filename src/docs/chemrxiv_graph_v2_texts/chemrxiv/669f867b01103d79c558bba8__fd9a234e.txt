Description:
Precursors that are cheap, versatile substrates for reversible O2 binding and release.

In order to overcome hypoxiarelated limitations, the design and development of biocompatible 
molecular vectors able to deliver O2 directly to the target tissues is gaining significant attention in the 
pharmacological field.9 In this context, an increasing amount of literature focused on aromatic 
endoperoxides (EPOs) as suitable OxygenReleasing Agents (ORAs).10 The polycyclic aromatic 
precursors are cheap, versatile substrates able to reversibly bind and release O2 when properly 
functionalized and stimulated. The chemistry of these interesting EPOs has been deepened in the 
past11 and many aspects regarding their preparation and reactivity are now wellknown and 
established.12 Among others, the group of W. Fudickar and T. Linker was able to produce a remarkable 
amount of EPOs from both anthracene13,14 and naphthalene15,16 derivatives.
