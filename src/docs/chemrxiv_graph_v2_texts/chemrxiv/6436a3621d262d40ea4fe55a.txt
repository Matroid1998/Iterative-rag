Description:
Molecules that exhibit differential chemical reactivity based on singlet and triplet states.

Text:
Chemical reactions whose outcomes are affected by electronic and nuclear spin are termed spin
chemistry processes1. Nuclear and molecularelectronic spin statistics are known lead to the 
differential chemical reactivity, for example, of singlet and triplet oxygen (O2) molecules. During the 
intermediate stage of redox chemical reactions in which radical pairs are formed, spin evolution may 
play a key role and change the outcome of chemical reactions2, leading to oscillatory occurrence of the 
reaction products (termed quantum beatings)3, as well as other timedependent observable 
quantities such as optical absorption4, fluorescence5,6 and spin polarization1,7. Often, a radicalpair 
mechanism (RPM) drives these processes and leads to the photochemically induced dynamic nuclear 
polarization (photoCIDNP)8,9, which manifests in substantial enhancements of NMR signal amplitude.
