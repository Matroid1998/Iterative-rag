Earthabundant transition metal (TM)based materials have attracted much attention 
as alternative electrocatalysts, especially in alkaline electrolytes.5 However, chemical 
modulation strategies of catalysts and economically viable synthesis routes to generate 
nanostructured materials with durable and enhanced catalytic performances are still required 
especially for the green hydrogen production, especially at an industrial scale.4, 6 
A major process bottleneck, when operating in alkaline media, is the reduced kinetics due to 
the waterdissociation energy barrier.7 However, alkaline water electrolysis allows the 
utilization of TMbased materials, which serve as PGMfree alternatives with better HER 
kinetics.8 Emerging technologies such as anionexchange membrane water electrolysis, for 
industrial scale water splitting, require electrocatalysts that are capable to even operate under 
mild alkaline conditions (less or equal to 1M KOH) or pure water.9 To enhance the kinetics 
of the reduction reaction, the chemical environment of TMbased catalysts can be tailored by 
incorporating nonmetals and metalloid elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen, 
selenium, and boron.10 Engineering of the materials morphology, crystal structure, and 
catalyst support are leveraged to improve extrinsic catalytic activity of complete electrodes.3 
A careful choice of the substrate material and the design of the substratecatalyst interface 
especially for highly conductive substrates is also important.11 This enables strong adhesion 
and enhanced charge transfer due to extended exposure of more catalytic active sites to 
adsorbates promoting the HER activity and lifecycle of the electrocatalysts.12 By combining 
the above strategies, earthabundant transition metalbased catalysts are developed with high 
activity comparable to precious metalbased catalysts.
