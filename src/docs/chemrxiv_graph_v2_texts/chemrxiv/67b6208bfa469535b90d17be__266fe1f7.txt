Description:
A catalyst that Ni could replace in the hydrogenation of NB to aniline.

Text:
In said mechanism, PhN(OH) either reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form aniline, or PhN(OH) 
reacts with itself to eliminate water and produce azoxybenzene.5 
Ideally, hydrogenation of NB to aniline at completion would be carried out in liquidphase at low tempera
ture over a solid catalyst employing earthabundant and lowcost Ni in place of Pt or Pd. So far, to the 
best of our knowledge, no such catalyst has been reported.

Description:
A component of a catalyst exhibiting excellent activity for hydrogenation.

Text:
Recently, for example, scholars in China re
ported a new Ptloaded Nigraphene magnetically separable catalyst (PtNiNG) at a Pt weight loading 
of 0.3 exhibiting excellent activity for the hydrogenation of NB to aniline achieving a turnover frequency 
of 27,240 h1 at 1 MPa reaction pressure and room temperature.6 Remarkably, the catalyst retained its 
selective activity over five consecutive testing cycles.
