Description:
Involved in oxidation reactions.

Text:
In analogy to genes in biology, the selected key
parameters are called materials genes of catalysis,6
since they correlate with the catalytic function of inter
est. The concept has been previously applied to model
the steadystate reactivity in alkane oxidation68, CO
oxidation 9, and CO2 hydrogenation.10 We note that
the relevance and weights of the different processes may
be very different for different materials. This questions
