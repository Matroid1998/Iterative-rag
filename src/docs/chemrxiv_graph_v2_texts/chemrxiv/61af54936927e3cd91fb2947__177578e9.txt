Description:
Key structures in natural products, biologically active molecules, agrochemicals, dyes, or materials science.

Text:
Nitrile and amide groups are all the key structures of natural products, biologically active molecules, agrochemicals, 
dyes, or materials science. In the past decade, nitriles were obtained from the conversion of oximes via dehydration,1 
as well as substitution reaction involving cyanogen reagents.26 In addition, carboxylic acid derivatives and amines 
are traditionally applied for the synthesis of amides via a condensation reaction, which needs to happen in harsh 
conditions.7 Unfortunately, most synthesis were performed with toxic reagents and cumbersome experimental 
operation. Though the great progress made in the generation of nitriles from aldehydes and have well applied in the 
wide substrate scope of aldehydes, there are few suitable methodologies for the synthesis of both nitrile and amide 
from aldehydes and ketone respectively.
