Description:
Present as two ions in the active site of AlkB enzymes, coordinated by a total of nine ligands.

Text:
However, in early 2023, two cryo
electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of two different AlkBs, both from the organism F. thermophila, were 
published.31, 32 The two structures are remarkably similar. Both show the six predicted transmembrane helices 
with a substrate channel leading from the periplasmic side of the protein to the active site, which rests in the 
cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The active site is comprised of two iron ions, coordinated by a total of nine
