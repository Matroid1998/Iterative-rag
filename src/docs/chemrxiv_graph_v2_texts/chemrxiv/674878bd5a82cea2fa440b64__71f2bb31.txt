Description:
An alkali metal cation with moderate size and electronegativity among the given alkali metals.

Its understanding has 
a pivotal role in understanding and tailoring materials in 
electrocatalytic systems. At the EDL, the surface of the OER 
active phase is in contact with the electrolyte. The precise 
structure of this EDL is influenced by the detailed surface 
structure of the catalyst, the kind of ions including solvation shells 
in the electrolyte as well as adsorbed at the electrode, and the 
interfacial pH, which can deviate from the bulk pH.6 In this study, 
we focus on the contribution of different alkali metal cations, 
whose effect on the EDL has been probed in various experimental 
and theoretical works.711 In the order Li  Na  K  Cs, the 
cation size increases, the electronegativity decreases, the 
hydration 
energy 
decreases12, 
and 
the 
Lewis 
acidity 
decreases13.

Description:
Has a hydration enthalpy of 409 kJ/mol.

These properties have implications on the hydration 
shell of these cations in the alkaline electrolyte. Taking Cs and 
Li for comparison, the solvation shell of Li is built from stronger 
noncovalent bonds. Cs, as a softer cation, on the other hand, is 
less solvated and is, therefore, expected to adsorb in larger 
quantities on the electrode surface.6,14,15 Their hydration 
enthalpies range from 519 kJmol for Li to 409, 322, and 264 
kJmol for Na, K, and Cs, respectively.16 The surface of the 
catalyst, that is in our case the surface of a NiOOH, OER active 
phase, varies depending on the conditions.
