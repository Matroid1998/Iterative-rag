vironmental microbiomes are continuously exposed to a broad variety of organic contaminants

that causes microbes to adapt their metabolism to xenobiotic compounds as novel substrates

and metagenomic information indeed hints at ongoing sequence mutations.10,11,2936

It is hypothesized that the evolution of oxygenases that can transform new contaminants in
51
biodegradation processes is tied to the erroneous handling of activated oxygen and the ensuing
52
release of reactive oxygen species (ROS),3739 a phenomenon referred to as O2 uncoupling.4045
53
Reactions with ROS can in fact inactivate proteins.
