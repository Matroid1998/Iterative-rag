Description:
A hydrophobic material used in gas diffusion layers with a metal catalyst coating.

Text:
While strategies for managing the gasliquidsolid boundary of the reactant 
stream, electrolyte, and catalyst are less mature than those of MEAs, considerable progress has been 
made in GDE systems by employing a hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL), such as 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), with a metal catalyst coating on the electrolytefacing side.3 

The manual assembly and operation of GDEs into electrochemical cells present an opportunity 
to accelerate experimentation via automation.
