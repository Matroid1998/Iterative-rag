Description:
Produced from two water molecules in the photosystem 2 protein complex during photosynthesis.

Text:
Every oxygen molecule we breathe is produced from two water molecules in 
the photosystem 2 protein complex of higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria. This highly 
endothermic reaction is carried out during photosynthesis using visible light energy under 
ambient conditions. To perform this task a unique water oxidising catalytic complex, 
Mn4CaO56, evolved some three billion years ago. This complex oxidises two water 
molecules to molecular oxygen at a rate approaching 1000 s1 at ambient temperatures and
