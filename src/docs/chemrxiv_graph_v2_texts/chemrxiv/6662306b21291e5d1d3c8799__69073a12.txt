Carbon (C), one of the most abundant elements in nature, displays various types of hy
bridized bonds, contributing to a rich energy landscape and a diverse range of properties
across different structural phases.13 This inherent versatility, combined with boundless pos
sibilities of its combination with hydrogen (H) leads to a plethora of structures and chemical
environments, ranging from simple hydrocarbons like CH4 to complex organic molecules like
carotenes (C40H56).49 The investigation of the hydrocarbons and other CH systems at atom
istic level is crucial for understanding chemical interactions and advancing materials design,
thereby, attracting significant attention from researchers.
