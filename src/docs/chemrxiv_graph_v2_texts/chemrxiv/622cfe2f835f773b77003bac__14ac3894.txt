Known for its high light transmittance and thermal insulation properties.

Aerogels have fascinated researchers because of their characteristic properties derived from their 
lowdensity structures. They have been fabricated from various materials, among which silica 
aerogel is the most representative one because of its high light transmittance and thermal 
insulation properties.1 However, among porous materials with low bulk densities, not many 
skeletal compositions lead to high visible light transmittance. Organic polymer aerogels such as 
resorcinolformaldehyde (RF),2 polyimide3 and polyurethane4 have low light transmittance 
or are opaque, and carbon aerogels5, 6 are black. On the other hand, bionanofiber gels, e.g.

Description:
Used as a framework in aerogels for optical materials in accelerator experiments.

cellulose and chitosan nanofiber, which have attracted considerable research interest in recent 
years, are also translucent because of their tendency to cause Mie scattering.7, 8 In fact, most 
of the aerogels that have been used as optical materials (detectors), for example, in accelerator 
experiments, are based on the silica framework.914 
In 2015, we reported the fabrication of aerogels using nanofibers with an aluminum 
oxide hydroxide (boehmite) framework.15 Boehmite nanofiber (BNF) aerogels obtained by the 
gelation of an acetic acidcontaining BNF suspension with the addition of a base, followed by 
washing and supercritical drying, have a minimum bulk density of 1 mg cm3, which is 
comparable to or smaller than the lowest bulk density of a typical silica aerogel.16 The skeletal 
network of the BNF aerogel is fiberlike and does not have interparticle necks like those observed 
in silica aerogel microstructures, and the BNF aerogel is mechanically strong considering its low 
bulk density.17 In fact, it has a relatively high Youngs modulus against uniaxial compression 
and does not crack when crushed.
