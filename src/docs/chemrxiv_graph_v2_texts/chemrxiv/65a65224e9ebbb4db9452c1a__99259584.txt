In recent decades, air pollution has emerged as a significant global
challenge with detrimental impacts on both human health and the en
vironment. Among the various air pollutants, nitrogen oxides (NOx),
encompassing nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
play a critical role in the formation of hazardous compounds and par
ticulate matter 16. These pollutants are primarily emitted from the
combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles, industrial processes, and power
plants. Upon inhalation, NOx can cause a range of health issues, includ
ing respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and exacerbation of
existing respiratory conditions 710. Additionally, NOx contributes
to the formation of acid rain and smog, leading to environmental degra
dation, ecosystem disruption, and subsequent economic costs 1114.
