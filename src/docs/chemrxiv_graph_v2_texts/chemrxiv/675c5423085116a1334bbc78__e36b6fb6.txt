Description:
Used as antiscalants in laundry additives and identified as a source of glyphosate in rivers.

Glyphosate is used to control many weeds.1 Due to its extensive use in agriculture, 
45 
horticulture, forestry, and urban environments, glyphosate is frequently detected in soils, water 
46 
bodies, food, and human fluids.211 Additionally, transformation of laundry additives in 
47 
wastewater (e.g., aminopolyphosphonates used as antiscalants) have been identified as a new 
48 
source of glyphosate in European rivers.12 Detection of glyphosate and its byproducts, 
49 
specifically aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), occurs despite their immobilization by 
50 
microorganisms, abiotic degradation, or retention on metal oxides in soils.1319 Increased public 
51 
concern regarding its potential toxicity and presence in the environment underscores the 
52 
importance of research into its persistence and interactions within ecosystems.
