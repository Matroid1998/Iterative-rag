Description:
Used as a reductant in chemical looping systems for CO2 transformation.

Text:
In recent years, chemical looping has been increasingly recognized as an effective technique 
for various chemical transformations, particularly those associated with CO2 utilization.29,30 For 
instance, a chemicallooping system for CO2 utilization employs CO2 adsorbents and CO2 reduction 
materials that can operate in various reactors.3133 This process can be used for CO2 transformation 
in the presence of O2 because the chemical absorption of CO2 is not inhibited by O2, and H2 as a 
reductant is not simultaneously introduced into the same reactor as O2. This is advantageous from a 
practical viewpoint because O2 is often present in waste gases containing CO2.
