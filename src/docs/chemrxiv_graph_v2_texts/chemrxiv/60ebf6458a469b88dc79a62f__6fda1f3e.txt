Description:
Involves a bond whose cleavage under photoexcitation is fundamental in chemistry.

Transition metal carbonyls have a rich legacy of well known photochemistry 13. The
23
nature of the metal carbonyl bond and its cleavage under photoexcitation is a fundamental
24
problem in chemistry with applications in catalysis and synthesis 1. The photochemistry of
25
more complicated cases of transition metal carbonyls containing metalmetal bonds, opens
26
alternative reaction pathways of energy relaxation 4. There has been a renewed interest
27
in these compounds with the advent of ultrafast spectroscopic techniques, which provide
28
means to precisely measure the initial photophysics and ultrafast evolution of the electronic
29
structure 5, 6.
