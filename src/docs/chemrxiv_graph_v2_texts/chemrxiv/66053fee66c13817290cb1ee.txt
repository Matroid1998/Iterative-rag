Description:
Used as an internal standard for the pseudo AgAgCl wire reference electrode in cyclic voltammetry.

Text:
Piperine is a potent inhibitor of 
cytochrome CYP4A6 and related familial isoforms 2122 but to the best of our knowledge 
the exact biological mechanism by which piperine is metabolised remains unknown.23 
There is, however, a body of evidence of typical piperine metabolites to enable confirmation 
by comparison. 2427 
Results and Discussion 
Prior to electrochemical reaction the cyclic voltammetry behaviour of piperine was measured 
28 We have previously shown the voltammetric behaviour of a drug molecule is inversely 
correlated to it in situ metabolic halflife.29 Using ferrocene (FcFc) as an internal standard 
for the pseudo AgAgCl wire reference electrode and a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the 
working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode (CE), the cyclic voltammetry 
behaviour of piperine was explored (Figures 1 ac).
