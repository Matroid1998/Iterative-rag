Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) where its adsorption energy affects catalytic activity.

Text:
Pt is the best catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).13 It can be explained by the well
known Sabatier Principle for catalysis the binding energy between the reactant and the catalyst 
should be neither too strong nor too weak. It should be strong enough so that the bonds in the 
reactant are activated, but not too strong to block the subsequent desorption of products.45 For 
ORR, this principle can be expressed as a volcano curve, obtained by plotting the ORR catalytic 
activity against the adsorption energy of oxygenated species calculated by density functional 
theory (DFT).6 Among metal catalysts, Pt indeed occupies the central position, with moderate 
adsorption energy for oxygenated species and the highest catalytic activity, which is consistent 
with the Sabatier Principle.
