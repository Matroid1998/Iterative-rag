Description:
Plays a major role in guiding zeolite synthesis through the ADOR process by preferentially occupying cubic double 4-ring (D4R) sites.

Text:
The process makes use of the specific (nonstatistical) dis
tribution of framework heteroatoms, generally germanium, to di
rect preferential hydrolysis of layered precursors into separate,
twodimensional intermediates, followed by targeted recondensa
tion into condensed phases4. This procedure allows for access to
zeolite topologies that are unavailable by other synthetic routes,
and indeed has led to the discovery of several new zeolite topolo
gies. From many previous studies, it has been established that
the presence of germanium has a major role in guiding zeolite
synthesis through the ADOR process5. Specifically, it is the pref
erential occupation of germanium atoms into cubic double 4ring
(D4R) sites that leads to the separability of layers, in e.g. zeolite
UTL, for which the ADOR approach has been most successful.
