Description:
A piezoelectric material with large responses, based on lead zirconate titanate.

Piezoelectric materials allow for the interconversion between
mechanical and electrical energy and find applications in di
verse areas including as sensors, actuator, and high precision
motors. Current stateofthe art piezoelectric materials are
based on inorganic ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate
(PbZr1xTixO3, PZT) with large piezoelectric responses.13
However, these materials are brittle, require high processing
temperatures, and may contain toxic and environmentally haz
ardous lead, which impose challenges for flexible and bio
compatible technologies. In the last decade, hybrid organicinorganic materials have
shown promising applications as, e.g., photovoltaics4,5 and
light emitting diodes,6 and more recently, high performance
hybrid organicinorganic ferroelectric and piezoelectric ma
terials have been reported.712 These materials are flexible,
solutionprocessable, and can be made from nontoxic and en
vironmentally friendly chemistries.
