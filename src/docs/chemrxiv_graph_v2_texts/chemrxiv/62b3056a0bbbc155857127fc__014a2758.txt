Description:
Compounds that react with Tz leading to slow release of alcohols and phenols, requiring 30 hours for 80% release.

1a), 
representing a strategy for the design of a variety of prodrugs, 
considering that OHfunctionalized compounds account for a 
large number of FDAapproved smallmolecule therapeutics.8 
However, only limited secondorder rate constants (k2) of less 
than 0.001 M1s1 have been observed for the IEDDA reaction of 
vinyl ethers and Tz.8 Versteegen et al. have subsequently 
developed rTCOethers and rTCOcarbonates that react 
substantially faster with Tz (k2 10 M1s1), leading to click
triggered release of alcohols and phenols (Fig. 1b).9 However, in 
the case of rTCOethers only slow elimination was observed, 
requiring 30 hours to obtain 80 of the released alcohol or 
phenol. While clicktorelease of phenolic rTCOcarbonates was 
found to proceed significantly faster (80 after approx.
