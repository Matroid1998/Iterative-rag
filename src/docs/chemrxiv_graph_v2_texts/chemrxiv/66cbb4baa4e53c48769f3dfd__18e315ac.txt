Description:
The chemical formula for the alloy tetrataenite.

Text:
Moreover, in the past few years, a new natural material has
been introduced, this material is coming from a meteorite component and it is named as tetrataenite which has a chemical
formula of (NiFe), it is an alloy. This new material has properties as the transition rareearth materials, it possesses a huge
magnetical properties. This material may possess advanced properties,which could be advantages for future catalysis,
engineering, and technologies applications. Interesting composite materials may be engineered in combination with other
materials as we know synergistic effect is playing interesting role in materials sciences applications. Therefore, we dedicate
here a brief review in the recent applications of nanomaterials designed from the inspiration of tetrataenite features in the
engineering fields. 2.
