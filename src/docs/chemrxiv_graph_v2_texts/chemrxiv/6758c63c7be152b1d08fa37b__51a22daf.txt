Description:
Subnano model catalysts examined for deactivation by sintering and coking.

Text:
In particular, carbon deposition (coking) under hydrocarbonrich conditions is a 
degradation mechanism that affects many catalysts, and for subnano clusters the high temperatures 
where coking tends to occur also are likely to drive sintering. The focus of this study is understanding 
the mechanisms by which Ge addition stabilizes subnano Pt clusters against both sintering and coking 
when the clusters are saturated by a model alkene (ethylene), and heated. We previously examined deactivation of subnano Ptnalumina (n  4,7,8) and Ptnsilica (n  
4,7) model catalysts by a combination of sintering and coking, during repeated ethylene temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.
