Description:
A faujasite-type zeolite used to remove sulfonamide antibiotics and other drugs like carbamazepine.

The adsorption of functional organic molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, personal care 
products, herbicides, insecticides, etc., in highsilica and allsilica zeolites is relevant in the 
context of different applications On the one hand, these hydrophobic adsorbents could be 
employed in the removal of emerging organic contaminants from wastewaters.1 Promising 
results have been obtained, for example, for the use of faujasitetype zeolite Y (FAU framework 
2) to remove sulfonamide antibiotics,3,4 other drugs like carbamazepine,5 and the personal 
care product triclosan,6 for highsilica mordenite (MOR framework) as adsorbent for various 
pharmaceuticals and other organic contaminants,7,8 and for zeolite beta (BEA framework) in 
the removal of drugs,9 pesticides,10 and perfluoroalkyl substances.11,12 On the other hand, 
highallsilica zeolites could also find use as carrier materials in the controlled delivery of drug 
molecules 1316 or for the encapsulation of organic UV filters, enhancing their UV filtering 
activity while at the same time preventing undesired release into the environment.17 Further 
potential applications of zeolites involving the adsorption of sizeable organic molecules from 
the liquid phase include the recovery of valuable fractions from complex mixtures, e.g., in the 
processing of rapeseed,18 and the use of zeolites as solid sorbents in (micro)extraction.19 
Given the vast number of potentially interesting organic species, and the multitude of zeolite 
frameworks that are available in highly or purely siliceous form (about 70 zeolite frameworks 
have been synthesised as allsilica zeolites to date 2,20), it is clear that experimental 
investigations of the adsorption properties are feasible only for a small fraction of the 
theoretically possible adsorbentguest combinations.
