Over the past decades, Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been widely 
27 
applied as ligands in organometallic chemistry,1,2 organocatalysts,3 and Lewis bases for the 
28 
stabilization of reactive main group species.46 Multifunctional NHCs that have additional 
29 
coordination sites on either the nitrogen atom(s) or on the backbone of the NHCs have led to 
30 
greater diversity in the structures and functions of NHCs. Given that the utility of the 
31 
multifunctional NHCs reported so far has been limited to their use as multidentate ligands for the 
32 
complexation of metals, the exploration of an unprecedented application of multifunctional NHCs 
33 
would significantly advance the development of their chemistry.711
