Description:
Used in the synthesis of the C20C26 fragment of the anticancer drug Halaven.

Text:
For example, compound 1 is used in the synthesis of the C20C26 fragment of 
the anticancer drug  Halaven.10,11 A kgscale synthesis of the bicyclic ketone, (1R,5S)
bicyclo3.1.0hexan2one (3), has been reported and this synthetic method begins with the chiral 
epoxide 1 (Scheme 1).12 In this transformation, the chiral epoxide is reacted with catalytic lithium 
2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidide (TMP) which allows insertion into the olefin group to provide the

bicyclic alcohol (2). Oxidation of the alcohol gives compound 3 as the single enantiomer.

Used to synthesize a potent series of cannabinoid receptor modulators and active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Text:
This 
bicyclic ketone has been used to synthesize a potent series of cannabinoid receptor modulators and 
active pharmaceutical ingredients.13,14 We have successfully used compound 1 in our current 
synthesis of a fragment of Lenacapavir 4, antiHIV drug, as shown in Scheme 1.15 
Scheme 1. A reported synthetic route for synthesis of compound 3 from epoxide 1.
