Description:
Forms the basis of carbon nanotubes, which have unique mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties.

Text:
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical tubes made from carbon, which are attracting 
great interest in the scientific community. They have many interesting mechanical, 
electrical, thermal, and optical properties.

Description:
Atoms connected on a graphene lattice in single walled carbon nanotubes.

Text:
CNTs have demonstrated to be superior 
additives to matrix composites and could play an important role in CO2 fixation and 
carbon cycles.13 In shielding materials, CNTs have been used due their high tensile 
strength and electrical conductivity at low density.4 Research on thermal properties 
point towards a isotropic thermal expansion of CNTs.5 And their high thermal 
conductivity has made CNTs attractive for electronic devices, optoelectronic devices 
and energy storage.68 Another remarkable discovery was in the optical properties of 
CNTs, as their absorption and fluorescence is linked to their diameter.911 Among them, 
single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have the most promising properties and 
they come in different structures (chiralities). The chirality is described with a roleup 
vector (n,m), that indicates connected carbon atoms on a graphene lattice (Figure 1).
