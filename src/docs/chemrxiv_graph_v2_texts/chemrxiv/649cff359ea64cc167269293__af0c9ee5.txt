Description:
A natural steroidal hormone with nanomolar affinities for ERa and potent agonist activity.

These nonsteroidal estrogens were able to 
mimic the natural steroidal hormone 17bestradiol (E2) with nanomolar affinities for ERa and 
potent agonist activity in reporter gene assays.1 Surprisingly, the Xray cocrystal structure of 
thieno2,3dpyrimidine (1) bound to ERa showed only a single hydrogen bond between the 
phenolic oxygen and E353 of the receptor (see Figure 2A).1 In contrast the phenolic oxygen of 
E2 forms an intricate network of hydrogen bonds with E353, R394, and a water molecule in the 
ERa ligand pocket that is essential for molecular recognition of steroidal estrogens.2 Initial 
analysis of the binding site suggested that the isomeric metaphenol (2) would be an improved 
estrogen mimetic, however it was shown to be much weaker for both receptor binding and 
agonist activity.1 The result was especially surprising since the 2isomer of the steroidal 
estrogen (Figure 1) that places a phenol in the same position in the ligand binding pocket as 
paraphenol (1) has been shown to have a 5fold weaker affinity for ERa.3 To resolve this 
puzzle and to further our understanding of how thieno2,3dpyrimidines function as nonsteroidal 
estrogens we performed a series of structurefunction, physiochemical, and computational 
studies to probe the interaction of the phenol pharmacophore with the receptor.
