Description:
A compound where incorporating anion vacancies and AgSbVX complex defects facilitates energetically unfavored SbIII to AgI replacement.

Selective 
generation of cationic vacancies has contributed to overcoming energy barriers in aliovalent 
doping reactions 20. To implement something similar beyond the nanoscale, it is necessary to 
create synthetic strategies that include much more complex disturbances in the defect structure of 
host matrices and might include external auxiliary tools to manage the qualitative and 
quantitative characteristics of ion exchange processing. Here, we present a robust strategy based on defect engineering and liquid phase design, 
capable of providing rapid cation exchange at the scale of TFs at low temperatures. We show 
that incorporating anion vacancies and AgSbVX complex defects into polycrystalline matrices of 
Sb2X3 (X S, Se) facilitates energetically unfavored SbIIItoAgI replacement over a long 
distance.
