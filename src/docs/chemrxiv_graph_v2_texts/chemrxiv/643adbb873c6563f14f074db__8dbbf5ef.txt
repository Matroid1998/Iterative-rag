Description:
A common oxide support used in catalysts.

Text:
The type of oxide support can substantially
inuence the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.3,4,20 Common choices for suitable oxides
include zinc oxide ZnO, zirconia ZrO2, titania TiO2, and alumina Al2O3. For example, the
ternary system of CuZnOAl2O3 is already an industrially established CTM catalyst, but
it displays relatively low conversion, typically below 20 , leading to eorts to develop more
selective catalysts in addition to the continuous search for increased activity.3,6,9,23 To this
end, zirconia (ZrO2) has been suggested as an alternative oxide support due to increased
turnover rates and selectivity of ZrO2supported Cu.3,20 Additionally, zirconia has been re
ported to oer enhanced thermal and mechanical stability and to prevent Cu particles from
