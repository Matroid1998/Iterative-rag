Description:
An ion-exchangeable monomer used in water-based photoresins.

Text:
Following debinding 
in air and sintering in a reducing atmosphere, the resulting copper 
architectures exhibit a minimum feature size of approximately 40 
m, accompanied by a high twin density and substantial copper 
content 
(96.2 
wt). The 
microstructure 
of 
copper 
is 
microcrystalline and compact, featuring an average grain size of 
6.5 m and 4.6  2.2 twins per grain. These findings underscore 
the powerful capability of this methodology in creating micro
architected 3D metal structures. A waterbased photoresin was developed, comprising 
sodium acrylate as an ionexchangeable monomer, polyethylene 
glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) as a crosslinker, PEGBAPO26 as a 
highly efficient waterborne photoinitiator, tartrazine as a photo
blocker to finetune printing resolution27, and cellulose 
nanocrystals (CNCs) as a toughening agent28 (Figure 1b).

Description:
A key active ingredient where Na ions can be replaced by Cu2 ions due to strong coordination.

Text:
Sodium acrylate was chosen as a key active ingredient, with Na 
ions being replaced by Cu2 ions due to their strong 
coordination29. Rheological measurements indicated that the 
incorporation of CNCs maintains a low resin viscosity, preserving 
the delay time while concurrently enhancing the elastic modulus 
after curing (Figure S1). Through the adjustment and optimization 
of printing parameters (Table S1), the successful fabrication of 
hydrogel scaffolds with a remarkable degree of design freedom 
was achieved. The addition of CNCs resulted in a reduction of the
