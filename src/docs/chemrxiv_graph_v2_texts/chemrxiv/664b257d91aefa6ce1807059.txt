Description:
Esters formed from glycerol and three fatty acid groups, abundant in marine oils.

Text:
Omega3 lipids (n3 or 3, first double bond from the methyl 
end group,  end, located on the third carbon atom) such as 
the triglycerides of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 205 3) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 225 3) abundant in 
marine 
oils 
are 
human 
essential 
nutrients.1 
These 
polyunsatured fats are key hormone precursors and 
moderate the propensity for arachidonic acid cascade 
overreactions when 6 (n6, first double bond from the  
end between 6th and 7th carbon atom) lipids dominate, 
defending tissue against oxidative stress.2,3 After over 
30,000 studies since Bangs and Dyerbergs landmark paper 
on plasma lipid and lipoprotein patterns in Greenlandic Inuit 
in 1971,4 the role of these long chain polyunsaturated fatty 
acid (PUFA) triglycerides in human health has been, at least 
in part, understood.1,2,3 

Omega6 lipids, in their turn, are abundant in most vegetable 
oils, pork, lard and turkey meat.
