Description:
Phosphorus-containing compounds with external PO-ligands at the I(III) center.

Text:
While most 
phosphoruscontaining iodanes like 5 and 6 are based on external POligands at the 
I(III) center20, 21, only a few examples of intramolecular POstabilization are known. Balthazor et al. reported the synthesis of the fivemembered iodane 7 (Figure 1, A), 
whereas Protasiewicz et al. published the synthesis of a phosphoruscontaining iodane 
with a pseudo cyclic structure. 22, 19 The first intramolecular phosphate stabilized 
iodane (8a) was synthesized by J. E. Leffler and H. Jaffe in 1973 by treating the 
corresponding phosphoric acid with peracetic acid.23 However, these initial 
explorations are focused on the structure of these compounds without investigating 
their further reactivity. Herein, we want to present the synthesis of various phosphate
