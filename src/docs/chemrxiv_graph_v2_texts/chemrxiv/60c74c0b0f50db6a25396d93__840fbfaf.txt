Description:
Used to access dithianes from a carbonyl compound in the presence of a Lewis acid.

Text:
Dithianes are commonly used in organic chemistry to 
mask the electrophilic nature of carbonyl groups1 in 
elaborated molecules but also serve as acyl anions in 
syntheses according to the Umpolung concept.2The 
main advantages of dithianes are their easy access 
from a carbonyl compound by using propane1,3
dithiol and a Lewis acid and their stabilities in 
alkaline and acid conditions notably permitting their 
purification on silica columns. In counterparts to this 
stability, many procedures have been developed for 
their deprotection but generally require drastic 
conditions.3 Most of the time, toxic metal salts as 
Hg(II),4 Ag(I),5 Zn(II),6 Ga(III),7 Cu(II),8 
Tl(V)9 and others are used in excess in harsh 
conditions 
with 
some 
success.
