Description:
Stabilizes radical intermediates in synthesis.

Text:
of carbonyl groups stabilizing the radical intermediate in triketone 13, the protection of carbonyl 
group adjacent to the radical center in 14, and the introduction of substituents at the site of radical 
10 
cyclization in 15, have predicted yields that are qualitatively in line with expert intuition. Compounds 16 and 17, which would readily lead to other clovane natural products, are predicted 
to cyclize in synthetically useful yields. Fig. 3. ML model informed synthesis of clovan2,9dione. (A) MLguided retrosynthetic

analysis and substrate refinement. (B) Counterintuitive 6endotrig radical cyclization enables the 
5step total synthesis of clovan2,9dione (1). As shown in Figure 3B, the synthetic route via radical intermediate 8 to clovan2,9dione (1) 
starts 
from 
commercially 
available 
4,4dimethylcyclopent2en1one 
(18).
