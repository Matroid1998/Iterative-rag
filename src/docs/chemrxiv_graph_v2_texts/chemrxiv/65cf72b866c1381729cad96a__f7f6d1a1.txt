Description:
Nanomaterials with continuous nanonetworks used for immobilizing enzymes at transducer surfaces.

Text:
As a direct electron transfer between enzyme and electrode may be 
challenging, and highly depending on the enzyme used, the use of redox mediators to facilitate the 
electron transfer can prove to be more effective.5 
 To date, a series of approaches have been developed to immobilize enzymes at transducer 
surfaces while achieving efficient electron transfer processes. 6 Nanomaterials with continuous 
nanonetworks are promising candidates, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and metal 
oxides. 79 However, the electrode fabrication processes are inefficient, which often adopt 
bottomtop approaches, leading to timeconsuming synthetic and doping steps for the 
bioelectrodes. In addition, health effects about employing these nanomaterials have been reported, 
in particular, the biocompatibility and the carcinogenicity of CNTs.
