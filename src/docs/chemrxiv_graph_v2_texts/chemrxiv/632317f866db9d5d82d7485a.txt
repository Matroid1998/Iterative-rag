Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful chemical characterization tool 
widely used in disciplines ranging from materials to biomedical sciences. However, it is limited 
by low sensitivity, typically requiring a substantial amount of material for analysis1. One promising 
way to overcome this limitation is via the use of nanoscale spin defects in solids, which can be 
brought in close contact with the sample26. The most promising system is the nitrogen vacancy 
(NV) center in diamond, which has been used to detect NMR signals from a few zeptoliters of 
material, single molecules or even nuclear spins under ambient conditions7,8. The NVcenter (Fig. 1 A) is a spin defect in the lattice of a diamond.
