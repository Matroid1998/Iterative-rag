Description:
d4 pseudotetrahedral complexes examined with density functional theory for stability.

Our curiosity about this question was further piqued by 
reports of quadruple binding in the diatomic molecule RhB12,13 and subsequently in several 
additional diatomics.14,15 Might an isoelectronic quadruplebonded metalcarbide fragment be 
isolable in the form of a synthetic complex?16,17 To shed light on the question, we have 
examined a series of d4 pseudotetrahedral tris(Nheterocycliccarbene) transition metal 
carbides and nitrides with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The nitrido 
complexes examined are closely related to stable, experimentally wellcharacterized 
systems18,19,20,21 and have been included here as calibration for our calculations on the 
speculative carbido systems. Based on their singlettriplet gaps and electron affinities, several 
of the terminal carbides examined are indeed expected to be thermodynamically stable and 
hence worthwhile synthetic targets.22,23
