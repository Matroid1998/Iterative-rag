A compound found in commercial electronic cigarette liquids.

Recent research claimed that cannabidiol (CBD) in commercial electronic 
cigarette (ecigarette) liquids can be converted into psychotropic amounts of 9
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This study aims to validate this claim using a realistic ecigarette 
setup. Additionally, this study also investigates if such a conversion may occur during 
smoking of CBDrich cannabis joints. Methods Two different CBD liquids were vaporized using two different ecigarette models, 
one of which was operated at extreme energy settings (0.2  and 200 W). The smoke of six 
CBD joints was collected using a rotary smoking machine according to ISO 43872019. Analyses were conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry as well as 
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS). Results For the condensed ecigarette liquids, no increase in THC concentration could be 
observed.
