ANION TRANSPORTERS WITH ANTIBIOTIC ANDOR ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY 
There is increasing pressure to develop new antibiotics to tackle the problem of antimicrobial 
resistance with 700,000 deaths occurring worldwide each year due to antibiotic resistance, and this 
number being estimated to rise to 10 million per year by 2050. 1,2 Cationophores such as lasalocid, 
monensin, narasin and salinomycin have been used extensively in animals as antibiotic agents and 
have been shown to be affective against Grampositive pathogens including MRSA. 35 However, it 
is only in the last decade that the potential of synthetic anionophores as antibiotic and antifungal 
agents has begun to be explored and efforts have been made to elucidate the modes of action. 611
