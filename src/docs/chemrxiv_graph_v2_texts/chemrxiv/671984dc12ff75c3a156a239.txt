Description:
Illustrates strong delocalization with quinonelike resonance forms showing conjugation.

Text:
For example, a particularly dramatic redshift is observed upon protonation of the 
central nitrogens of mesotetrakis(4aminophenyl)porphyrin (H2TAPP), with the lowestenergy 
band of H2TAPP shifting from 669 nm to 813 nm to H4TAPP2 (note that the peripheral 
amino groups remain unprotonated).6,7 The strong delocalization that generates the 
hyperporphyrin effect can be illustrated with quinonelike resonance forms that show 
conjugation between the aminophenyl groups and the protonated porphyrin. Gouterman and 
coworkers performed semiempirical calculations that supported this charge transfer;8 more 
recently, we published a TDDFT study, further refining the spectral assignments for 
H4TAPP2.9
