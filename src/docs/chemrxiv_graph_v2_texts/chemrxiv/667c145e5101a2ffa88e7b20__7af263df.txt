Description:
Used in Suzuki-Miyaura reactions, which are versatile and practically important.

For instance, 
they are used in palladiumcatalyzed SuzukiMiyaura reactions, 
which are of exceptional versatility and practical importance.2 For 
this reason, these reactions and their constituent elementary steps 
have been studied extensively.3 
Given the need to develop environmentally more sustainable meth
ods, the use of the rare metal palladium is currently viewed more crit
ically and efforts are undertaken to replace it by more abundant 3d 
metals. Here, copper is one of the most promising candidates due to 
its wellproven activity in crosscoupling reactions.4 Accordingly, 
various catalytic applications relying on boroncopper transmeta
lations have been realized. However, the mechanistic understanding 
of these transformations remains limited, thereby hindering their ra
tional optimization.
