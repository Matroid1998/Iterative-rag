Lipid oxidation is a major factor contributing to the deterioration of the sensorial quality of food products 
2 
containing oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids.1 In many of these products, oil is dispersed as droplets in a continuous 
3 
aqueous phase,2 such as sauces, dressings, and infant milk. In these oilinwater (OW) emulsions, lipid oxidation 
4 
is enhanced by the large interfacial area at which prooxidants present in the continuous aqueous phase are close 
5 
to the lipids.1,3 Lipid oxidation can be mitigated by utilizing synthetic antioxidants, packaging the products in inert 
6 
atmospheres, and storing products at low temperatures.3 Although these measures are very effective, the food 
7 
industry faces pressure to develop alternative solutions.
