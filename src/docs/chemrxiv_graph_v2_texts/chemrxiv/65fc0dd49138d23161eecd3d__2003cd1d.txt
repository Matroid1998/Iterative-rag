Description:
An anti-inflammatory agent featuring a terpene moiety proposed to be biosynthesized from an oxidized geranyl building block.

Text:
For instance, elodeoidol G (2, Figure 1), an anti 
inflammatory agent isolated by Luo, Kong, and coworkers, 
features a terpene moiety proposed to be biosynthesized from 
an oxidized geranyl 
building block through a series of 
epoxidations and an acidcatalyzed epoxide opening cascade. 14 
Similarly, the cytotoxic compound hyphenrone J (3, Figure 1), 
isolated by Qin, Xu, and coworkers, contains two prenyl groups 
and an oxidized geranyl side chain.15 
Biosynthetically, the phloroglucinol portion of cleistocaltone A 
(1) is proposed to originate from champanone B (4, Figure 1). Addition of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP, 5) then forms geranyl 
champanone B 6. Subsequent desaturation of the geranyl 
terminus and isomerization of the homobenzylic double bond 
generates a triene, enabling an intramolecular DielsAlder 
cycloaddition (IMDA) with the cinnamoyl dienophile.
