Visualized using fluorescent calcium sensitive dyes to indirectly interrogate neuronal activity.

Recording the electrical transients that accompany sig
nal transduction within neuronal cells is a key tool in ex
perimental neuroscience but remains a great challenge. The standard method for recording changes in membrane 
potential relies on whole cell electrophysiology, which is, 
however, invasive and low throughput.1,2 More recently, 
optical methods to interrogate signal transduction in neu
rons have emerged as a viable alternative to patchclamp 
techniques.3,4 Visualizing calcium transients with fluores
cent calcium sensitive dyes, both synthetic58 and protein
based,911 have become a highly popular optical approach 
to indirectly interrogate neuronal activity.
