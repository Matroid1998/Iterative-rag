Description:
A valuable chemical and fuel produced from syngas conversion.

Text:
A prime example of this is synthesis gas (syngas) conversion, which is an
important industrial process that can be used to produce valuable chemicals
and fuels such as ethanol and higher hydrocarbons. Here, the reaction network
features a wide range of dierently sized intermediates.47 Understanding
the selectivity of syngas conversion on a given catalyst therefore inevitably
requires at least an approximate notion of the adsorption energies of these
larger molecules. The main problem with this is that there are typically many local minima
on the adsorbate binding energy surface for larger adsorbates. This is due to
the fact that the possible binding motives on a catalyst surface are numerous in
this case, including multidentate geometries.
