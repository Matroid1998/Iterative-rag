Description:
Forms as a layer when AlxTi1xN coating heats up, increasing oxidation resistance.

The synthesis of nitrides in the form of metastable high Alcontent AlxTi1xN by CVD, where 
the cubic structure of TiN is preserved while adding AlN, i.e., increasing x, up to at least 0.9,17 
has gained increasing interest in recent years18,19. The presence of AlN increases oxidation 
resistance of the formed AlxTi1xN film by converting to an Al2O3 layer as the coating heats up 
resulting in increased oxidation resistance.20 Different techniques such as PVD that include 
reactive sputtering21,22, ion plating23, and cathodic arc evaporation24, and CVD22,25,26 have been 
employed in deposition of AlxTi1xN as a wear resistant coating. Albeit none of these techniques 
can combine precise film thickness control, high conformality and high uniformity in film 
quality and composition over large areas.
