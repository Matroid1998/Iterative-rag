Description:
Used as an anode in solid-state batteries.

Solidstate batteries are considered as one of the most promising next generations of 
energy storage technologies with a potential to revolutionize electric vehicles (EVs), due 
to their high energy density and intrinsic safety1. Here, the solid electrolyte is key since it 
allows the utilization of Li or Si as anode and the possibility to have bipolar cell 
configurations. Hence, several solid electrolytes have been explored, whereby most of 
them fall into two groups2 (i) Oxidebased solid electrolytes, such as garnettype 
Li7La3Zr2O12 and NaSICONtype Li1xAlxTi2x(PO4)3 and (ii) sulfides, such as thio
LISICONtype Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and Argyroditetype Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl). Of most solid 
electrolytes, LPSCl is considered one of the promising candidates, owing to its high ionic 
conductivity, favorable mechanical performance, and ease in processing3.
