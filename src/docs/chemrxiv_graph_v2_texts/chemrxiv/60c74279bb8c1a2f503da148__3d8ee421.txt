Description:
A metal-organic framework (MOF) known for its high porosity and negative thermal expansion (NTE).

Text:
In particular, several families of zeolites exhibit
NTE.6,7
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials, sub
ject to increasing attention, that can produce a wide variety of
porous framework structures through the combination of organic
ligand units and metal nodes.8 Many MOFs exhibit NTE, includ
ing the prototypical MOF5 and UiO66.911 MOFs have advan
tages over traditional dense solids due to their high porosity, with
