Description:
Transitions from the black phase to the yellow phase via a direct onestep pathway requiring a barrier of 68 meVatom, which can be reduced to 31 meVatom through a multistep process.

ies have been predicted that CsPbI3 transitioning from the black phase to the yellow phase via a
direct onestep pathway requires overcoming a barrier of 68 meVatom12, which can be reduced
to 31 meVatom through a multistep process involving four transition states and three metastable
states13. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have predicted a different transition
mechanism that the yellow phase of CsPbI3 transforms into a liquidlike disordered structure at
high temperatures before recrystallizing into the black phase14. Experimental validation of the
atomiclevel transition mechanism is currently infeasible, leaving the underlying mechanism un
clear. Water plays a crucial role in the BY phase transition in MHPs1521.

Description:
Exhibits a phase transition from black to yellow, sensitive to environmental humidity.

Under dry conditions,
rapid cooling can maintain the material in the metastable black  and  phases without transi
tioning to the yellow phase4,16,22. Experimental evidence suggests that without water molecules,
defect introduction via laser irradiation is insufficient to induce the BY phase transition16. How
ever, under humid conditions, water molecules in the air trigger the nucleation process of the BY
transition, and the transition is highly sensitive to environmental humidity1719. As humidity in
creases from 53 to 73, the nucleation barrier of yellowCsPbI3 decreases from 1.34 to 0.57
eV9. Additionally, the rate of the BY phase transition in CsPbI3 nanowires exhibits an instan
taneous response to environmental humidity, enabling realtime control of the transition rate by
regulating environmental humidity20.
