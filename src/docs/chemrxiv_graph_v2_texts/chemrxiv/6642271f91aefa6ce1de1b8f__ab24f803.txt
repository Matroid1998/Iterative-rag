Description:
A class of compounds that includes caffeine.

Text:
Caffeine a legal psychoactive and representative purine alkaloid found in the leaves of the 
Coffea arabica 1 form xanthine and uric acid metabolites in the body with only 3 of caffeine 
being excreted unchanged.2 These diverse caffeine metabolites enter the water environment 
and have implications for ecopharmacovigilance.3 Although the electrochemical behaviour of 
caffeine has been studied for uses including as sensors and determination of caffeine 
concentration, 45 to the best of our knowledge no structure electroactivity relationships 
(SeAR) of metabolite formation nor single step synthesis of major caffeine metabolites  
paraxanthine and theophylline have been developed. The primary human metabolism of caffeine (Scheme 1) proceeds predominantly through N3
demethylation to paraxanthine via CYP1A2 in the liver (7080 of metabolites). 3,6,7.
