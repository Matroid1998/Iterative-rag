Description:
A solvent used in the study, providing a deaerated environment for luminescence.

Text:
To achieve these properties, several strategies have been developed 1) TADF emitters capped 
with human serum albumin (HSA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA).5 Xiong et al. were the first to 
report a TADF emitter, DCFMPYM (Figure S1a), that was used in conjunction with BSA. This 
adduct was employed as the contrast agent in the TRLI of MCF7 cells, and showed longlived 
luminescence (d  22.11 s in deaerated ethanol) at PL of 649 nm.5a, 5b The BSA protein provides a 
hydrophobic cavity and a reductive environment that shields the emitter from oxygen, thus permitting 
the longlived delayed emission of DCFMPYM to persist in the cells.
