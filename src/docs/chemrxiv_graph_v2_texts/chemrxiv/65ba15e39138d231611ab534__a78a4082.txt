Description:
Equipped with an acid-labile dimethoxytrityl (DMTr) 5OH protecting group that is removed in the deblocking step.

Text:
In their original form, the phosphoramidites are equipped with an acidlabile dimethoxytrityl (DMTr) 5OH 
protecting group that is removed in the deblocking step to allow for the next coupling reaction, but beginning in 
the 1990s, researchers developed largescale parallel synthesis of DNA by replacing the DMTr group with a 
photolabile equivalent to allow for spatially selective deprotection. In particular, Affymetrix combined 
photolithographic techniques adapted from the semiconductor industry with the use of photolabile protecting 
groups for both peptide and DNA microarray synthesis810. DNA microarray synthesis became the first ultralarge
