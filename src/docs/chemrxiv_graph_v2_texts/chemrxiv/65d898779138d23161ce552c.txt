Description:
Involved in formate lyase reactions within anaerobic metabolic pathways.

Text:
Benzylsuccinate synthase 1,2 belongs to the family of fumarateadding enzymes (FAE) 3,4 
which is itself part of the growing superfamily of glycyl radical enzymes (GRE)58. GRE are 
involved in surprisingly different, but always chemically demanding reactions in anaerobic 
metabolic pathways of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. In addition to FAE, the currently known 
families of GRE consist of the pyruvate formate lyases (PFL) 9,10, type III anaerobic 
ribonucleotide reductases (ARNR) 11,12, glycerol 13 or diol dehydratases 14, 
hydroxyproline dehydratases 15, arylacetate decarboxylases 1619, choline 2022 and 
isethionate lyases 23,24. Their common reactive feature is either the formation, cleavage, 
or rearrangement of CC, CO, CN, or CS bonds in biomolecules via radicalbased addition or 
elimination mechanisms 5,6.
