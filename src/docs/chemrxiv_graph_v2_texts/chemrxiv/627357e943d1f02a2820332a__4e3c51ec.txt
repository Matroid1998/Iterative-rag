Description:
A greenhouse gas mainly responsible for global climate changes and a leading cause of global warming due to emissions from human activities.

Greenhouse gases, 
e.g., CO2, and NOx, are mainly responsible for global climate changes. Among these gases, CO2 
emission to the atmosphere from human activities such as breathing, industrial processes, and the 
burning of fossil fuels is one of the leading causes of global warming111. Thus, several methods 
were reported for CO2 capture and utilization (CCU), including adsorption and sequestration12. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are organicinorganic crystalline porous materials1322. They 
have welldefined pore structures with high porosity as high as 50 of the crystal volume, offering 
low density (0.21 gcm3) and high specific surface areas ( 10,000 m2g for some cases)23. They 
can be produced via a reticular synthesis procedure, creating ordered networks or framework 
structures with strong bonds between organic and organic moieties24.
