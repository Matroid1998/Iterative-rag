Electrodes with optical and (spectro)electrochemical properties.

Text:
A potent strategy for detecting such small absorption changes 
is the application of a periodically modulating potential and 
tuning a lockin amplifier onto the frequency of the modulation. With such potentialmodulated absorption spectroscopy 
(EMAS), even weak signals can be distinguished from a 
prominent background. In this work, we apply HIn2O3 (IHO) silica glass substrates as 
working electrodes (WE) for reductive and oxidative EMAS 
measurements of four different PbS QD samples with excitonic 
transitions between 1474 nm and 1729 nm. We demonstrate 
successful hole and electron injection and find evidence for 
shallow ingap density of states. Results 
Optical and (spectro)electrochemical properties of the IHO 
electrodes 
In Figure 1a, we compare the optical transmittance of IHOfilms 
on glass used here as working electrodes to commercially 
available FTO substrates.

Description:
Substrates with superior transmittance above 1000 nm, particularly above 1500 nm.

Text:
It is apparent that the IHO substrates 
are superior to FTO for all wavelengths above 1000 nm, 
particularly above 1500 nm. At 2000 nm, the IHO transmittance 
is still  80 , while the FTO transmittance has decreased to 5 . In the visible range of the spectrum, we observe fluctuations in 
the transmittance of the IHO substrates, which we attribute to 
interference effects. This is supported by the finding that the 
frequency of the fluctuations increases with the IHOfilm 
thickness. While such fluctuations can be problematic for 
techniques that measure A spectra (such as EMAS), the 
thickness dependence may be used to finetune the fluctuations 
into less important spectral regions (for details see 
Figures S1S2). a.
