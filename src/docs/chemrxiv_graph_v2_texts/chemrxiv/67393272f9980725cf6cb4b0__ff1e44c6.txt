Description:
A platinum group metal that adsorbs nitrogen species more strongly than Pt, leading to faster catalyst deactivation.

Text:
Many single and multimetal catalysts on a wide variety
of supports have been explored experimentally to understand
how altering the catalyst could potentially help control path
way selectivity.810 For transition metals, N2 formation has
been shown to be selective on Pt and Ir.11 For other platinum
group metals including Rh, Ru, and Pd, they adsorb nitrogen
species much more strongly than Pt, which results in faster
catalyst deactivation.11,12 Coinage metals are on the other
extreme of this spectrum, with low affinity for N, and thus
making them inactive for N2 production.11,12 As for multi
metal systems, it has been shown that IrRh nanoparticles
