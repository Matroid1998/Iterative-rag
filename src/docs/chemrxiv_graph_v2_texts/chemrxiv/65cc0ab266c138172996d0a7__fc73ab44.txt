Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), renowned for its green and environmentally friendly 
52 
properties, has catalyzed extensive research efforts aimed at developing synthetic 
53 
methods, largely fueled by its diverse industrial applications, including textile 
54 
bleaching1, chemical synthesis2, papermaking3, pharmaceuticals4, and water 
55 
purification5. Currently, industrial H2O2 production primarily depends on the costly and 
56 
polluting RiedlPfleiderer process, involving alkyl anthraquinone oxidation and 
57 
hydrogenation.69 Fortunately, the direct electrosynthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 
58 
through the twoelectron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) presents a promising 
59 
alternative. This strategy offers lower energy consumption, environmental friendliness, 
60 
and reduced transportation and storage risks, making it suitable for smallscale and even 
61 
in situ production.1012 Despite larger development (e.g.

63 
2e ORR, however, available electrocatalysts for 2e ORR suffer from limited activity 
64 
and selectivity, hindering widespread commercial adoption. Thus, finding a high
65 
performance electrocatalyst for 2e ORR is crucial as an alternative to the Riedl
66 
Pfleiderer method. 67 
Essentially, H2O2 is partially produced from O2 through the ORR process on the 
68 
cathode. O2 activation relies on metal site backdonation; higher backdonation yields 
69 
two adsorbed oxygen, while lower levels fail to activate O2. Hence, optimizing back
70 
donation of metal site is crucial for catalyst design to enhance H2O2 performance.
