Description:
Metal complexes involving NO ligands with an effective d electron count.

Text:
Fifty years ago, in a master stroke, Enemark and Feltham chose to sidestep the problem of local 
oxidation states by assigning an effective d electron count n to metal nitrosyls.9 Now known as 
the EnemarkFeltham electron count, n refers to the number of metal d electrons plus the 
number of NO p electrons; thus Fe(II)  NO corresponds to n  6  1  7 and is denoted as 
FeNO7. Despite the popularity of the notation, chemists have retained a strong interest in the 
oxidation state problem and have sought to assign oxidation states to both the metal and NO 
fragments in nitrosyl complexes. Unfortunately, density functional theory, the major 
theoretical tool for such studies,10,11,12,13,14,15 suffers from several pitfalls.
