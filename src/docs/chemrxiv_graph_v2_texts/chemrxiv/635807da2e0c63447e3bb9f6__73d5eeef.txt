Description:
Chemical contaminants in drinking water that require further investigation due to predicted mutagenicity.

Text:
In particular, predicted mutagenicity and occurrence frequency indicated the 
need for further investigation of halogenated hydroxycyclopentenediones (HCDs) 
and dibromomethanesulfonic acid in drinking water. Overall, this approach 
demonstrated that employing some selectivity for general molecular properties in NTA 
overall helped shortlist suspect and potentially toxic chemical contaminants with higher 
confidence, in this case for organic acids. 4
