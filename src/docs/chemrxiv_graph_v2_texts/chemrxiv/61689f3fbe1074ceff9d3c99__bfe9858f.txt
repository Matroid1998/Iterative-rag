Description:
An intramolecularly bound compound that partially redistributes to dichlorostannane and triphenylstannane.

Text:
Utilizing van Kotens N,C,N pincer ligand,11 (2,6
(Me2NCH2)C6H3), Rika and coworkers reported a partial redistribution at RT of an intramolecularly bound 
monochlorostannane (Figure 1, 1) in solvent to the dichlorostannane and the triphenylstannane after a 2 week time 
period.12 Nechaev and coworkers later detailed the high yield redistribution reaction of six coordinate PhSn(2O, N 
OCH2CH2NMe2)2Cl (Figure 1, 2) with PhSnCl3 to the symmetrical dialkoxydichlorostannane and Ph2SnCl2 species.13 In 
both examples, the presence of hypercoordinating interactions from the tethered donor side chains lead to a reversed 
redistribution of these organotin compounds. NMe2
