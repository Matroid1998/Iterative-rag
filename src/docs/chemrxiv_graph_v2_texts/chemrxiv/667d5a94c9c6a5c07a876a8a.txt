Description:
A macrocycle known for its ability to adapt polarity through conformational change, enhancing passive membrane permeability.

Text:
The ability of macrocycles to adapt their apparent polarity to that of the surroundings by conforma
tional change 14 has been termed chameleonicity 15, 16, with cyclosporine A being the most thoroughly
investigated example 17. In an apolar environment (such as the interior of a cell membrane), the
polar groups are shielded from the surroundings through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Chameleonicity
signicantly increases the passive membrane permeability of a compound in the presence of a relatively
