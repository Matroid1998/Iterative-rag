Description:
Reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form aniline or with itself to eliminate water and produce azoxybenzene.

Text:
In said mechanism, PhN(OH) either reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form aniline, or PhN(OH) 
reacts with itself to eliminate water and produce azoxybenzene.5 
Ideally, hydrogenation of NB to aniline at completion would be carried out in liquidphase at low tempera
ture over a solid catalyst employing earthabundant and lowcost Ni in place of Pt or Pd. So far, to the 
best of our knowledge, no such catalyst has been reported.
