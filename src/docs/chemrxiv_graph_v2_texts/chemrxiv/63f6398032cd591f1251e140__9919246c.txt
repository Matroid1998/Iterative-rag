yielding poly(dithiocarbonates) presented in this report. x  
0 (R  H) ,1 (R  H, alkyl). Using the liquid heavier homologue CS2 is 
substantially simpler as it can be employed as a 
cosolvent and in principle allows access to 
copolymers with even higher sulfur ranks. However, the ROCOP of CS2 with oxygen 
containing heterocycles has so far been plagued
