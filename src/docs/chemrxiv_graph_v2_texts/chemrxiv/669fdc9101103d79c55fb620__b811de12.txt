While primarily renowned for its role in oxygen transport 
and storage within hemoglobin and myoglobin,1 iron fulfils nu
merous other critical roles.2 Iron is a crucial component of cyto
chromes involved in the energyproviding electron transport chain 
in mitochondria.3 Ribonucleotide reductase, an irondependent 
enzyme, is necessary for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, 
the building blocks of DNA crucial for cell division and repair.4,5 
Iron also acts as a cofactor for various enzymes responsible for 
protection from oxidative stress6,7 or for the synthesis or degrada
tion of hormones and neurotransmitters.810 Nature has developed 
a sophisticated system to tightly regulate irons uptake and home
ostasis through proteins and hormones like transferrin, ferroportin, 
ferritin and hepcidin.11 This system ensures a delicate balance 
between meeting physiological iron needs and preventing the 
adverse effects of iron overload.
