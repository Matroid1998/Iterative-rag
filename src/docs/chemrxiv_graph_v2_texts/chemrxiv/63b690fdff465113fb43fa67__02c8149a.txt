Description:
A perovskite series exhibiting multiple reversible phase transitions due to changes in hydrocarbon chains and inorganic layer arrangement.

While the early investigation of the optical 
properties is quite limited, this important group of publications provides a very accurate and 
solid structural basis for current research.46,10 
In particular, Billing reported the crystal structure and phase transition behavior of the 
(CnH2n1NH3)2PbI4 perovskite series for 4n16 showing, in general, the presence of multiple 
reversible phase transitions due to changes in the hydrocarbon chains and the relative 
arrangement of the inorganic layers.46 Some of these compositions, in the form of single 
crystals, have been also characterized in terms of their optical properties indicating that the 
photoluminescence (PL) spectra for 4n12 are very similar but without providing detailed 
quantitative data and putting emphasis on the temperature dependence of the optical
