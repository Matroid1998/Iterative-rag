Description:
Dissolved in dichloromethane or methanol for activation of the SABRE catalyst.

Text:
Upon activation of the SABRE catalyst precursor Ir
(COD)(IMes)Cl (IMes  1,3bis(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)imi
dazol2ylidene; COD  cyclooctadiene), with any of the
substrates and dissolved H2 in dichloromethane (DCM) or
methanol (MeOH) (see Supporting Information), several iso
topologues of the nal octahedral complex are formed; they
are depicted schematically in the Figure 1c. The most abun
dant complexes containing the ligated substrates are the
ones with all nitrogen nuclei being 14N (98.9 ), followed
by species in which equatorial sites are occupied by an equal
amount of 14N and 15N nuclei (0.73  of all complexes). The
species in which 15N occupies axial position are present at
even lower percentage (0.36 ). Other isotopologues are
possible but their occurrence at natural isotopic abundance
is statistically very rare.
