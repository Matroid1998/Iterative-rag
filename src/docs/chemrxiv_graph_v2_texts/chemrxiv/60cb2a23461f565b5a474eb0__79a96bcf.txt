Description:
Used in the conversion to CH4 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

Text:
For example, CH4 production rate of 15.4 Nm3m3 d was achieved using a lab scale BTF
10 as compared to 3.7 Nm3m3 d using CSTR 11 and 0.25 Nm3m3 d using upow reactor 12. In addition, the BTF does not require stirring or gas recirculation and hences oers a lower operating
cost. The BTF technology can also be applied with other sources of CO2, e.g. for biomethanation of
syngas 13. In BTF the conversion of CO2 and H2 to CH4 is carried out by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens
(HM), a class of anaerobic archaea found in the anaerobic digester for the biogas production. The HM
are enriched and immobilized on a packing material in the form of biolm and the substrate gases pass
over it.
