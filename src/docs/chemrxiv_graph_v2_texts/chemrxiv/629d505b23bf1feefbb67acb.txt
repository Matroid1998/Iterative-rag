Description:
A chemical element involved in partial pressure and poisoning effects on catalysts.

Text:
However, Rubased catalysts are more sensitive to hydrogen partial pressure and 
more susceptible to hydrogen poisoning than Febased catalysts because the hydrogen order of Rubased 
catalysts is often negative while that of Febased catalysts is positive 10,11. On the other hand, Rubased catalysts reported in recent years exhibit high activity and durability under
