Description:
Participates in the formation of hydrogen bonds within proteins.

In some cases, the biomolecular 
PT process can be initiated with an external cue, such as with a light flash for lightgated proton 
channels or by depolarizing the membrane for voltagegated proton channels, which enables 
following the kinetics of the PT process from start to end (4, 5). The use of point mutations, 
chemical modifications, and inhibitors, together with the knowledge of the protein structure, has 
resulted in the understanding of PT pathways within proteins (69). In mechanistic terms, it is 
established that the PT pathway is comprised of specific amino acids that can participate in the 
formation of hydrogen bonds together with networks of water molecules within the protein (6, 7, 
1012).
