Description:
Nitrogen-rich heterocycles explored for synthesizing drug-like molecules.

Text:
Nitrogencontaining heterocycles are central scaffolds in medicinal chemistry and are 
incorporated in most smallmolecule drugs.1, 2 We were interested in feasible 
strategies to synthesize nitrogenrich heterocyclic scaffolds that can extend the 
currently available libraries with new druglike molecules. Our past work on pyrazoles 
36 and triazoles 711 motivated us to search for suitable and versatile strategies

to explore access to triazolepyrazole hybrids. Triazolepyrazole hybrids, particularly 
nonfused heterocycles of this class, have not been investigated systematically. Selected known derivatives (Figure 1, 14) inhibit the serinethreonine kinase ERK3 
12 or the choleracausing bacterium Vibrio cholerae 13, show antimicrobial 
properties 14, and can act as P2X7 antagonists, a receptor involved in 
neuroinflammation and depression 15.
