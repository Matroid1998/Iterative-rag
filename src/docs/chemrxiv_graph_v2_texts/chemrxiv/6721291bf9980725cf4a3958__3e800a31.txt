Description:
Diagnostic of aggregation states through 15N29Si coupling and 29Si chemical shifts.

Text:
Our emerging interest in heavier alkali metals is intended to facilitate 
applications in organic synthesis via a combination of structural and mechanistic 
studies and the development of strong bases with useful properties.1,2,3 We began 
what was intended at the outset to be a limited twopart study of organopotassium 
chemistry. The first stage focused on evaluating the solventdependent solution 
structure of potassium hexamethyldisilazide (KHMDS), the preeminent potassium 
amide used in synthesis.3 We exploited the Method of Continuous Variation 
(MCV) to determine the aggregation state in limited cases.4 15N29Si coupling and 
29Si chemical shifts in 15NKHMDS3 that had proved diagnostic of aggregation 
states in sodium hexamethyldisilazide (15NNaHMDS)2b proved invaluable.
