Description:
A well-known catalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER).

Text:
VolmerTafel mechanism Platinum, as a wellknown catalyst for HER, is thought to follow the this 
process2, which requires the combination of two MHads species. The observed bond length of the 
hydrogen molecule is just 0.74,3 but the distance between two neighbouring atoms in pure platinum 
(cubic, space group Fm3m) is 2.774.4 This demonstrates that the distance between nearby platinum 
atoms is 3.74 times the length of the hydrogen bond, and that extra energy is required for atomic 
hydrogen transfer across a long distance. In the VolmerHeyrovsky mechanism, the MHads is formed 
during the first Volmer stage, there is no obvious and persuasive procedure to explain adsorbing 
another H atom from water to form a H2 molecule.
