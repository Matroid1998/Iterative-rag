Description:
The Z-isomer has a thermal half-life of 4.7 hours, preventing photostationary states.

UV light can also promote
22dimerizations that alter the structure and function of nucleotides and has a limited
(epidermal depth, 0.1 mm)2 tissue penetration depth, thus limiting the therapeutic potential
of photoswitches in photopharmacology. The Zisomer of azobenzene has a thermal halflife
(t12) of 4.7 hours, which prevents the establishment of photostationary states. Ideal photo
switches feature long absorption wavelengths and long t12; unfortunately, the simultaneous
optimization of these parameters is challenging and has been empirically observed to com
pete. Functionalizing the phenyl rings has been shown to shift the max of azobenzenebased
photoswitches into the visible range. Konrad et al. 3 recently demonstrated that function
alizing the phenyl rings with halogens at the ortho positions led to a substantial red shift
to 410 nm.
