Description:
A gas for which the MOF shows high selectivity compared to N2.

Long et al. recently reported 
Cr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82 (BTT3 1,3,5benzenetristetrazolate)12 MOF, which exhibits very high 
selectivity for oxygen over hydrogen and nitrogen. Despite the structural similarity of this MOF 
to other metal ion MOFs reported, this shows high selectivity towards O2 compared to N2 and is 
currently one among the best MOFs for O2 selective separations.12 While multiple factors can 
influence gas adsorption in MOFs, the origin of very high selectivity for O2 is perplexing because 
structurally similar metal ion MOFs are unselective. Though the role of spin state and spin coupling 
in selective gas binding is not well studied in MOFs, there are reports on the magnetic separation 
of small molecules.13 The spin statesbased selectivity of gas in MOF14 needs to be addressed in 
detail.
