Description:
A heterocyclic ligand that influences spectral, electrochemical, and catalytic properties of Ru complexes.

Text:
The structure of the bridging ligand is one of the most 
important parameters controlling the interaction between the photocatalyst and the metal 
complex catalyst in the dinuclear complex and thus governing the efficiency of the dual catalyst. Variation of the structure of the bridging ligand allows fine tuning the catalytic system in view of 
enhancing its activity15, 34. The nature of substituents in the heterocyclic ligand and their position 
in the core significantly influence spectral, electrochemical and catalytic properties of Ru 
complexes3539. One may assume that binding metal complex and photocatalyst via various 
positions of the heterocyclic ligand (1,10phenanthroline or 2,2bipyridine) will help to improve
