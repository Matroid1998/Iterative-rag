Description:
An electron-withdrawing group that unexpectedly improves selectivity in 1,2-cis-galactosylations.

Crich con
cluded that formation of a dioxolenium ion was a borderline 
phenomenon that, although detectable, was not crucial to stere
oinduction in galactosylations directed by 4Oesters.25 
Under either of the above theories, the addition of electrondo
nating groups to the ester would be expected to improve stere
oselectivity, while electronwithdrawing groups would be ex
pected to be detrimental to selectivity. Herein we report obser
vation of an unexpected trend in studies of 1,2cisgalactosyla
tions, wherein high selectivity is observed using an electron
withdrawing paranitrobenzoate ester at position 4.34
