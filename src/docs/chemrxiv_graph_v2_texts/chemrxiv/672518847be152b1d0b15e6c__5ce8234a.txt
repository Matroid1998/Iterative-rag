Limiting global temperature rise to the 1.5C Paris target is becoming increasingly unlikely (IPCC, 2023). 40 
Global mean temperatures have risen by 1.1C relative to 18501900, and carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
41 
methane (CH4)  the two most abundant greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the earths atmosphere  are 
42 
responsible for approximately 50 and 30 of this warming, respectively (IPCC, 2023). Anthropogenic 
43 
CH4  mainly from agriculture, fossil fuel production, and waste decomposition (Saunois et al., 2020)  
44 
has become an attractive target to mitigate nearterm global temperature rise because of its potency and 
45 
short atmospheric lifetime relative to CO2. Ocko et al.

Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.

Text:
(2021) estimate that substantial and fast reductions 
46 
in CH4 emissions this decade could slow the pace of global warming by 30 and avoid 0.25C of 
47 
additional warming by 2050. 48 
Governments are increasingly making CH4 a focus of broader decarbonization strategies. Over 
49 
150 countries are participating in the Global Methane Pledge, a voluntary initiative to reduce CH4
