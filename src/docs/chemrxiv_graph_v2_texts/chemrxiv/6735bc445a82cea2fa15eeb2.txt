Description:
High-solid acrylic resins need to reach very high conversions to give acceptable thermomechanical properties.

of XLDeff, a single parameter for the assessment of thermomechanical 
properties. Therefore, it can be tremendously useful in streamlining the insilico design 
and optimization of the microstructure of complex polymer networks. Furthermore, our 
simulations provide a clear picture of the curing process of these networks, which 
potentially informs the formulation optimization. For instance, there is common knowledge 
that highsolid acrylic resins need to reach very high conversions to give acceptable 
thermomechanical properties52 and our results unravel the reasons behind this. High
