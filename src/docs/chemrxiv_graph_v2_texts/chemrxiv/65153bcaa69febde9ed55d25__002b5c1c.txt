Description:
A topology assigned to hexagonal C3 and C6 carbon allotropes.

Text:
The topology determination for the new phases is now made easy with the 
TopCryst program 5. Information on all carbon allotropes extracted from the literature is indexed in 
the SACADA database 6, which currently contains 703 allotropes. Diamond (both cubic and hexagonal) is still considered to have superior atomic density, elastic moduli 
and hardness 1. Recently, however, several superdense (  3.635 gcm3) carbon allotropes have 
been predicted from the firstprinciples studies 7,8, and hexagonal (space group P6222) C3 with 
assigned quartz topology (SACADA qtz 11) has even been claimed to have a hardness of 113 GPa 
8, i.e., 15 harder than diamond. Also, very recently superdense (  3.666 gcm3) ultrahard (HV  
102 GPa) hexagonal C6 (space group P6522) allotrope with qtz topology was proposed by us 9.

Description:
A topology observed in binary and ternary compounds.

Text:
The quartz topology is also observed in binary (ZnTe) and ternary (GaAsO4, FePO4) compounds. In 
particular, under pressure, in addition to the cubic sphalerite structure (space group F43m) 
characteristic of zinc chalcogenides, ZnTe also exhibits a trigonal HgStype structure (space group 
P3121) 10 with qtz topology. This may be because the Pauling electronegativity ()of the chalcogen 
decreases from oxygen ((O)  3.44) to tellurium ((Te)  2.10). Knowing (Zn)  1.65, ZnO is an 
ionic compound (ZnO1.79), while ZnTe is already a covalent compound (ZnTe  0.45).
