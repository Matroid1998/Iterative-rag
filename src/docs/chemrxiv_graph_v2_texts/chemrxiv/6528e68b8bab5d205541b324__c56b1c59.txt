Description:
Involved in electrochemical kinetics and conversion processes.

Text:
The interplay of these two materials,
creates a unique interfacial environment where
electrode polarization can modulate local elec
trolyte composition, ion pairing, and the result
ing interfacial solvation structure, in turn in
fluencing the electrochemical kinetics that con
trol the viability of critical processes such as
CO2 conversion. Here we use vibrational spec
troscopy and molecular simulation to study the
electrodeelectrolyte interface under conditions
relevant to CO2R. We reveal how ions like Na
