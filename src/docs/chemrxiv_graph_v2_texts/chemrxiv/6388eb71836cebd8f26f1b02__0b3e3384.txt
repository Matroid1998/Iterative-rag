A bidentate aromatic ligand used in Hofmann-like clathrates.

can also play an important role in climate change and the
development of capture strategies is interesting not just for
environmental concerns but also for the possibility of reusing
them in other industrial chemical processes. 17
Hofmannlike clathrates with general formula Fe(pz)M(CN)4
(pz  pyrazine, M  Ni, Pd, Pt) 18 are a versatile class of
MOFs with octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) centers con
nected by cyanide ligands, CN, to a squareplanar open
metal site, M(II). The resulting FeMII(CN)4layers are
pillared by bidentated aromatic ligands resulting in three
dimensional networks. These materials are interesting for
gas capture applications due to the combination of open
metal M(II) sites and bistable Fe(II) spincrossover centers.

Description:
A ligand in Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4 that shows hindered libration upon gas adsorption.

Text:
We
report a detailed study of gas adsorption mechanism of CO
and CO2 in Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4 in the lowspin state by means
of neutron scattering techniques and densityfunctional the
ory calculations. We identified the two adsorption sites, on
top of the openmetal site and between the pyrazine rings,
and the most stable orientational configuration of the guest
molecules and the pyrazine ligands of the framework was
determined. The inelastic neutron scattering results as
sisted by DFT calculations, show signatures of a hindrance
of the pyrazine libration and the outofplane movement of
cyanide ligands when the gas is adsorbed. Together with the
computed binding energy and a molecular orbital analysis,
these results agree with a physisorption mechanism for both
gases.
