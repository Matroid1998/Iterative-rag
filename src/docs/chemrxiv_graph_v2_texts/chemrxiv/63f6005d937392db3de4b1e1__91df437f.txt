Description:
Undergoes redox-neutral functionalizations with selected 1,3-dienes.

Text:
Unlike the abovedescribed reductive couplings amenable to a variety of CC 
unsaturations, the redoxneutral ketone functionalizations so far very limited and only 
observed with selected 1,3dienes17,18. The transformations require either harsh conditions 
andor the addition of base or wateralcohols for a reactive catalyst system. These eventually 
lead to epimerization of sensitive stereocenters and thus pose challenges for diastereo andor 
enantioselective processes. Thus, a more general approach is desirable and would be of a high 
synthetic value. Transitionmetal catalyzed CH bond functionalization became an important tool to construct 
CC bonds21,22,23,24. In this context, nondirected nickel(0)catalyzed (hetero)arene C(sp2)H 
activations and downstream reaction with olefins opened a successful strategy towards olefin 
hydroarylations under relatively mild conditions and full atomefficiency (Fig. 1b)25,26,27,28.
