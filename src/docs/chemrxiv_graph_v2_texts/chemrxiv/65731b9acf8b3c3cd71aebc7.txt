Description:
An element that can be produced sustainably via photocatalysis without the need for fossil fuels.

Text:
Hydrogen production via photocatalysis is an emerging pos
sibility for sustainable hydrogen production without the need
for fossil fuels. In this context, homogeneous lightdriven
catalysis emerges as a promising approach, seamlessly in
tegrating essential processes, such as light harvesting and
electron transfer, within a single system.
