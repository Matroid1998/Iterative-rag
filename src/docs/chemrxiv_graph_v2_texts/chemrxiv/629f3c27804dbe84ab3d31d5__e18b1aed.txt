Description:
Superior to Ag as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Text:
In both reaction mechanisms, on the other hand, the differences in catalytic behaviour of various 
catalysts toward HER are not stated, such as the rationale for Pt being superior to Ag. The defect of 
these mechanisms arising from this indiscrimination appears most evidently in the designing future 
catalysts for HER, so far, all of effective catalysts were developed by empirical method, so that, both 
catalytic mechanisms are of no use for predicting the catalytic activity of various catalysts for HER. Reported result of metals catalysts for HER 
Table 1 presents the selection of previous experimental values of exchange current density for the 
electrolytic evolution of hydrogen on pure metal catalysts.5 It is obvious that reduced exchange
