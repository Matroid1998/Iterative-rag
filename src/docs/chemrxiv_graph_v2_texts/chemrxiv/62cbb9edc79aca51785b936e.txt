Description:
Cations that occupy space between ZrO6 octahedra, forming BaO12 polyhedra.

The critical reaction to incorporate protons into the crystal lattice and possibly activate fast 
proton conduction in the oxides is hydration3, 7, 8. BaZrO3 perovskite, known as a mother 
compound that exhibits fast proton conduction35, consists of ZrO6 octahedra and Ba cations. The ZrO6 octahedra are connected to each other via the apexes of their oxygen anions through 
the entire perovskite, while the Ba cations occupy the space between the ZrO6 octahedra by 
loosely forming BaO12 polyhedra to maintain the structure. Doping trivalent acceptors, M, into 
tetravalent Zr sites, making MO6 octahedra, is a prerequisite for hydration to occur, where 
oxygen vacancies, VO, are created in the lattice to maintain the electroneutrality of the system 
(Figure 1a). The defect reaction is expressed in the KrgerVink notation as
