Description:
A polymer whose properties vary greatly depending on the degree of polymerization.

Text:
Polymer melts have many unique characteristics, such as viscoelasticity and entanglement, 
which are not observed in lowmolecularweight compounds. The properties of polymer melts 
vary greatly depending on the degree of polymerization in addition to their chemical species 
(polyethylene, polyacetylene, polysiloxane, etc.). Largemolecularweight polymer melts 
generally show high viscosity and take a long time to relax their molecules conformation and 
mechanical response. In particular, those above around the critical molecular weight (Mc) exhibit 
significant nonNewtonian properties owing to the molecular entanglement.13 Polymer melts are 
not only used as materials on their own but are often used in combination with other solid materials, 
such as for lubrication or fabrication of composite materials. In these applications, the interfaces 
between polymer melts and solids play crucial roles.
