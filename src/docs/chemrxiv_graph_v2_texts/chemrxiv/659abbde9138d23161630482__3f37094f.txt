Increasing technological demands, rising inflation, and global ecological crises of the modern 
era pose challenges that require extensive research dedicated to improving energystorage 
technology using highperformance, economically viable, and sustainable materials. Currently, 
lithiumion batteries (LIBs) dominate the field of energystorage technology due to their 
relatively long life cycle and high energy density 1. However, the primary anodic material used 
in LIBs for commercial purposes, graphitic carbon, faces limitations in terms of its low 
theoretical gravimetric capacity of 372 mAhg, hindering its potential for future technologies 
2. Furthermore, the unsustainable refinement and production routes of both natural and 
synthetic graphite are energyintensive, highly polluting, and geopolitically problematic.
