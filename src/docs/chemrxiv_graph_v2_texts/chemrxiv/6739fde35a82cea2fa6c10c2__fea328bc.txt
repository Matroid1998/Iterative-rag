Carbon dioxide is the main byproduct of fossil fuels com
bustion and the largest contributor to global warming.13
Among greenhouse gases, CO2 is responsible for approxi
mately 66 of Earths total radiative forcing.4 Thus, there is
an urgent need for developing chemical processes to capture
and transform CO2 into valuable compounds, such as olefins
and alcohols.512 These processes can support a sustainable
society if they are combined with the largescale production
of hydrogen from renewable energy sources.1315 Because
the molecule is rather inert, the efficient conversion of CO2
requires the use of catalysis.
