Description:
Undergoes transformation via metalhydride hydrogen atom transfer with high chemoselectivity.

Text:
Alkene transformation via metalhydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has become an effective 
method in synthetic organic chemistry.1 One of the main reasons for this is the high 
chemoselectivity of metal hydrides (e.g., iron and cobalt) toward alkenes (Figure 1). Markovnikov
selective formation of carbon radicals from alkenes is possible even in the presence of various 
functional groups on the reaction substrate. Various oneelectron reactions can occur using carbon 
radicals. Thus, it provides excellent tolerance to a variety of functional groups that are otherwise 
sensitive to acids, bases, heat, and reducing and oxidizing agents, and is an essential tool for the 
rapid and selective construction and modification of structurally diverse compounds.
