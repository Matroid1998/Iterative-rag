Description:
A sterically hindered unsaturated coupling partner used in dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation.

Text:
Driven by the pharmaceutical industrys endeavor to escape from flatland, increasing efforts have 
been devoted to construction of 3D molecules with strategic installation of chiral elements.1 
Axially chiral molecules are among this regime, and there has been increasing demand for 
enantioselective access to atropoisomers with diverse scaffolds.2 Three synthetic strategies have 
been adopted to this end.2e Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) represents a 
prevalent strategy.3 Starting from either an atropomerically labile or stable aromatic reagent, 
axially chiral products have been derived via DYKAT of a CH4 or a Chalo bond,5 respectively. Alternatively, Tanaka,6 TanLiu,7 our group,8 and others9 have realized DYKAT of a sterically 
hindered unsaturated coupling partner such as an alkyne or a carbene reagent.

Description:
A component in three-component Suzuki reactions with aryl halide and aryl boronic acid to form axially chiral olefins.

Text:
In prior studies, a sterically hindered but reactive aryl halide has been typically employed toward 
de novo construction of axially chiral biaryls (Scheme 1a). Early studies took advantage of the 
Suzuki reactions for atroposelective synthesis of CC biaryls.5a,10 The Song group11 further 
developed threecomponent Suzuki reactions between aryl halide, alkyne, and aryl boronic acid, 
affording axially chiral olefins. The same group also extended the reaction pattern to CB axially 
chiral products via a Miyaura reaction.12 By retorting to amidetethered isocyanide as a reactive 
coupling reagent, the Zhu group13 realized Pdcatalyzed atroposelective synthesis of 
diarylquinazolinone via CC coupling. The Taguchi14 group and our group15 addressed 
atroposelective synthesis of CN biaryls via BuchwaldHartwig coupling of two sterically hindered 
substrates.
