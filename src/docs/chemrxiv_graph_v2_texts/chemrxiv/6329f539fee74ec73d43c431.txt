Description:
Can cause aesthetic issues in drinking water due to source water and pipe corrosion.

Text:
Polyphosphates and sodium silicates are used widely as drinking water additives, often 
to control aesthetic issues caused by iron from source water and pipe corrosion. These 
additives have been shown to decrease the colour and turbidity of iron suspensions.15 
They reduce particle size, alter morphology, and increase stability by imparting strongly 
negative zeta potentials.36 There is also evidence from laboratory studies that they 
control iron corrosion.7,8
