Description:
Binds to the conserved cofactor pocket of Smyd isoforms.

Text:
Smyd1 belongs to the SET (Suppressor of variegation, En
hancer of Zeste, Trithorax) and MYND (MyeloidNervyDEAF1) domaincontaining protein
family (SMYD), consisting of five members (Smyd15), which are methyltransferases whose
catalytic SET domain is split by an MYND domain..5 In 2019, Edoardo et al. reported 11
Smyd2 inhibitors and 6 Smyd3 inhibitors.6 To date, no published inhibitor targeted to the
substrate pocket of Smyd1 is available. Only Sinefungin (SFG), which is similar to the en
dogenous molecules SadenosylLmethionine (SAM) or SadenosylLhomocysteine (SAH),
is known to bind to the conserved cofactor pocket of the three isoforms.7
As shown in Figure 1.a, the Smyd1 protein includes three main domains8 The SET
