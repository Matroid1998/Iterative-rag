Description:
The largest pool in soil that is biogeochemically active.

Soil is an important source of life on earth. It provides a reservoir of plant nutrients and
contains the largest carbon pool that is bio
geochemically active13. The functioning and
composition of terrestrial ecosystems, as well
as longterm climate regulation, are affected by
the soil. Leveraging the soils potential to mit
igate climate change requires an understanding
of its geochemical processes46. The organic fraction, also known as Soil Or
ganic Matter (SOM) is a diverse and com
plex mixture of organic substances, formed
through the interplay between various factors
such as plant and microbial inputs, the nature
of the parent material, and the climatic condi
tions1,7,8. Humic substances (HSs) are major
components of SOM formed from the decom
position of plant and microbial residues.
