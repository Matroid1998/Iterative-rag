Description:
Reactive species formed via lipid oxidation that can be scavenged by antioxidants.

Text:
In
37
food emulsions, protein emulsifiers are known to react with
38
free radicals formed via lipid oxidation thus acting as antioxi
39
dants via scavenging free radicals (BertonCarabin et al., 2014;
40
Schaich, 2008; Schaich and Karel, 1976; Wang et al., 2020;
41
Berton et al., 2012). Emulsions stabilized by whey proteins,
42
for example, showed better oxidation stability than emulsions
43
stabilised by the surfactant Tween (Zhu et al., 2018). It has
44
therefore been argued that due to their proximity to lipid
45
radicals generated in the droplet phase, proteins adsorbed at
46
the oilwater interface can function as effective antioxidants.
