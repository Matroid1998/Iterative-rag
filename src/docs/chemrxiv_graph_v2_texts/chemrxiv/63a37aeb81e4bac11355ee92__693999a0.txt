Description:
A cannabinoid with potential interaction in GPCR pathways within PDAC cells.

Text:
of THCV, HHC and HHCV as potential candidates 44 towards the 
248 
treatment of pancreatic cancer through possible interaction of GPCR pathways that are found 
249 
within PDAC cells could modulate and contribute to the proapoptotic and antiproliferation 
250 
properties that these cannabinoids produced invitro. The IC50 values of these compounds 
251 
compared to PARP inhibitors which are known for treating various cancers, are much lower 
252 
resulting in a more efficient compound for the specific treatment of pancreatic cancer. A semi
253 
SAR study by hydrogenating THCV and producing HHCV, did provide slightly lower IC50 value 
254 
on specific PDAC cell line.
