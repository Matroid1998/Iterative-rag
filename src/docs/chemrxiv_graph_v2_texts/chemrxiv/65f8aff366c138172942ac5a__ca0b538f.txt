Lithiumion batteries have become a norm for energy storage these days. Many advances
to increase their efficiency have been proposed. In the realm of material science, electrode,
electrolyte, and separator are interesting design elements. Specifically focusing on anodes,
several materials are being explored such as graphitic materials, metals, metal oxides, and
metal phosphide.1 A key material explored is silicon. The obvious reason for silicon being
a promising candidate is its high theoretical specific capacity (4200 mAhg for Li22Si5 2)
compared to the current graphite anode (372 mAhg3). Furthermore, silicon is the second
most abundant element in the earths crust, making it a readily available material.
