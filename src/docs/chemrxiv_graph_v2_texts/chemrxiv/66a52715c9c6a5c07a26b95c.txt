Description:
A metabolite involved in Nurr1 modulation.

Text:
These observations suggest great therapeutic potential of pharmacolog
ical Nurr1 modulation in neurodegenerative diseases68,10 prompting the search for Nurr1 modulating small molecules. The collection of available Nurr1 activators discovered and developed to date comprises the dopamine metabolite 5,6dihydroxyin
dole (DHI, 1)11 and natural fatty acid metabolites12,13, the antimalarial amodiaquine (AQ, 2)14,15, the AQdescendent 4A7C301 (3)16, 
AQderived fragments17 and analogues of DHI18 (Chart 1). Furthermore, we have recently developed the highaffinity Nurr1 agonist 
419 and mimetics derived by de novo design20 as nextgeneration chemical tools. These structurally diverse scaffolds provide a basis 
for the development of potent Nurr1 agonists. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20243bm54 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000297553394 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
