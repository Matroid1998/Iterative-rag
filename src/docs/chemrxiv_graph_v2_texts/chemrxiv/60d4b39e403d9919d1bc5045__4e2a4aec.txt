Description:
An important photoredox catalyst with differences in ground and excited-state dipole moments depending on counterion identity.

While many reports note spectral changes due
to ionpairing in common photoredox catalysts,30,3236 there are currently no direct quantitative methods that can probe the
ground and excitedstate electron density distribution to understand how ion pairing inuences the excited state structure
and evolution. Here, we introduce a modern implementation of timeresolved dielectricloss spectroscopy (TRDL) to in
vestigate how counterion identity inuences the excitedstate charge distribution within an important photoredox catalyst,
IrdF(CF3)ppy2(dtbpy)X.3739 We nd large differences in both the ground and excitedstate dipole moments depending on
