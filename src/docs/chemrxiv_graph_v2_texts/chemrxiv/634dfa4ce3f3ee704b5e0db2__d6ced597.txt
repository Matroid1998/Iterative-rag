Description:
Used as a starting point in water-catalyzed and autocatalyzed reaction mechanisms for adenine formation.

Text:
reported a pathway for synthesizing an HCN pentamer, adenine,
17
from the HCN tetramer, AICN.16 This observation triggered a search for even simpler reactants. 18
Among the important milestones along the way, Sponer et al. derived the reaction pathway for
19
adenine formation from a simple formamide dimer, N(Aminohydroxymethyl) formamide,17 and
20
later Wang et al. used formamide as an even simpler starting point using watercatalyzed and
21
autocatalyzed reaction mechanisms (orange box in Fig. 1a).18,19 Finally in 2016, Kua et al re
22
ported reaction pathways starting from HCN, NH3 and H2O to synthesize a formamide trimer,
23
1,3,5triazinane2,4,6triol (blue box in Fig. 1a).20 This abbreviated history, spanning 10years
