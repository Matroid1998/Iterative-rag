Description:
Used in the light-driven double bond isomerization as an energy fueling mechanism for molecular motors.

Artificial molecular machines are miniaturized versions of macroscopic machines and work by 
controlling dedicated motions within their molecular structures.19 Such control needs to be 
achieved against the equilibrating force of the Brownian motion to allow operation out of 
equilibrium.10, 11 In this regard molecular motors stand out as one of the most important subtypes 
of molecular machines as they convert external energy input into directional motions, which are 
not canceling out over continuous operation.2, 5, 1217 The first realization of a molecular motor was 
achieved in 1999 by Feringa, who used the lightdriven double bond isomerization of an 
overcrowded stilbene as energy fueling mechanism.18 This achievement gave rise inter alia to the 
Nobel prize in chemistry in 2016.3 Since then, the development of molecular motors is growing 
ever steeply and today a large number of different variants with different working mechanisms, 
energy supplies, and types of motions are available.
