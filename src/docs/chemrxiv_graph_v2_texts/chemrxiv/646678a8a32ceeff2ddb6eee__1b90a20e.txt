Description:
Carbenes with saturated carbon centres replacing a nitrogen atom.

Text:
Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are popular spectator ligands due to their modularity, strong donor 
strength, and in some cases acidity.1 Carbenes featuring heteroatoms other than nitrogen have been of 
interest since the early days of stable carbene research, including the report of a persistent 
(phosphino)(silyl)carbene in 1989.2 In 1997, a benzoxazolyl metal complex was reported,3 and a thiazol2
ylidene and its dimer was disclosed.4 More recently, mesoionic carbenes (MICs, 2001)57 and cyclic 
(alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs, 2005)810 have yielded examples with unsaturated and saturated carbon 
centres replacing a nitrogen atom, respectively. These variations on the NHC framework provide ligands 
with differing substitution patterns and electronic properties. Scheme 1. Structures of common carbenes.
