Description:
A polymer used to modify gold-coated QCM quartz surfaces for DNA hybridization studies.

Text:
These results confirm that the majority of the signal 
comes from specific DNA hybridization, while some residual nonspecific adsorption of ONs 
occurs. The changes in dissipation values (0.02x106 and 0.027x106) after introducing 10 M and 50 
M CON solutions, respectively (Figure 1(B)), mirror the quartz crystal frequency changes. The changes in dissipation after exposing the film to the solution of CON reflect the formation 
of a more rigid layer of dsDNA, upon hybridization of the CON to the surfacebound ON probe 
4041. Figure 1. (A) The change in QCM frequency of poly(PyPhEGcoPyPhON) (101)modified gold
coated QCM quartz surface upon introducing 10 M and 50 M CON target into the detection 
chamber. (B) Dissipation shifts (the data were smoothed using the SavitzkyGolay method).
