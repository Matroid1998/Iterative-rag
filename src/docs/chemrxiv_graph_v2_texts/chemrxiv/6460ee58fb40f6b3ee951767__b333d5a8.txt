Description:
React with hexabutylditin and Pd(0) to form alkyl radicals.

. Organometallic chemistry affords some of the most useful reactions in synthesis today. Recently, a 
lot of interest has been shown in the possible involvement of radicals in reactions using palladium or 
nickel salts and complexes.14 Generation of carbon radicals  for example, an early comparison of 
the reactions of aliphatic iodoesters (i) with hexabutylditin and (ii) with Pd(0) reagents by Curran 
et al.5,6 identified the formation of alkyl radicals in both cases. Reports of the formation of radicals 
from reactions involving palladium chemistry have increased markedly in recent years, with notable 
examples from Alexanian and Gevorgyan, among others.711 Many of these relate to aryl halide 
substrates. In particular, Gevorgyan has pioneered the use of Pd sources, usually under 
photoactivated conditions, to give rise to hybridPd radicals.
