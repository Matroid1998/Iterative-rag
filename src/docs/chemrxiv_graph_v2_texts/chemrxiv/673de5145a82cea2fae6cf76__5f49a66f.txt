Description:
An orthorhombic compound with high ZT up to 2.6 in single crystals and 3.1 in polycrystalline samples.

Text:
The current industrystandard materials for
low and hightemperature applications are based on Bi2Te3 (ZT
1 from 350450 K,2 ZT up to 1.9 reported for nanostructured
(Bi1xSbx)Te3 alloys10,11) and PbTe (ZT up to 2.2 at 915 K with
endotaxial nanostructuring12). However, the low abundance of
Te precludes widespread adoption, and thus alternatives com
posed of more abundant elements are critical.2
The discovery of high ZT in orthorhombic SnSe (up to 2.6 in
single crystals13 and 3.1 in polycrystalline samples14) has led to
considerable interest in the group IVVI sulphides and selenides.

Description:
Exhibits unusually low lattice thermal conductivity associated with the high-temperature Pnma Cmcm phase transition.

Text:
The favourable electrical properties of these materials are well
established from the use of SnS as a photovoltaic (PV) absorber
material,15 and SnS and SnSe also show unusually low latt as
sociated with the hightemperature Pnma Cmcm phase transi
tion.1619 However, the headline ZT in orthorhombic SnSe is
only achieved at high temperature, whereas many potential ap
plications of TEs require the recovery of lowgrade waste heat,2
and so SnSe cannot replace Bi2Te3.

Description:
Displays rich structural chemistry with potential phases for superior low-temperature thermoelectric performance.

Text:
While the thermoelectric performance of orthorhombic SnS
and SnSe is well characterised, the IVVI chalcogenides display a
rich structural chemistry, with several potential phases that could
show superior lowtemperature thermoelectric performance (Fig
ure 1).2123 Among these, the recentlydiscovered metastable cu
bic  phase of SnS and SnSe2426 has shown considerable po
tential for photovoltaic applications.2729 A recent study of the
IVVI chalcogenides also revealed new structuralproperty rela
tionships that suggest the  structure should lend itself to low
