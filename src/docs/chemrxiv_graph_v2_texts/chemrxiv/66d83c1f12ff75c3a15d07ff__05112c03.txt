Description:
An anion from ionic liquid that contributes to high ionic conductivity.

further explored ionic mobility in crosslinked 
PEObased ternary SPE systems that incorporate C4mpyrTFSI ionic liquid with relatively low 
concentration of LiTFSI (25 mol), demonstrating a decrease of LiEO interactions in the 
ternary system due to the additional TFSI anions from ionic liquid that contributes to the high 
ionic conductivity.15 The crosslinking process, induced by UV irradiation, helps to form a 
stable network that enhances the mechanical integrity of the SPE while accommodating the 
beneficial properties of ILs. The effectiveness of UVinduced crosslinking in the development 
of polymerplasticisersalt ternary systems was further validated by other researchers.16,17
