Description:
A neurotransmitter transported by the Monoamine Transporter subfamily within the SLC6 family.

Text:
The Solute Carrier Transporter Family 6 (SLC6) represents an important group of transporters 
within the large family of Solute Carriers (SLCs), playing an essential role in transporting 
neurotransmitters, amino acids, and osmolytes across cell membranes. (1) Comprising several 
subfamilies, SLC6 transporters are fundamental to an array of physiological processes and neural 
signaling pathways. (2) A prominent example is the Monoamine Transporter subfamily (MAT) 
comprising the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters, which have been a major area 
of interest for their therapeutic effects in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. (1,2) Additionally, 
the SLC6 family includes other subfamilies, such as the GABA, amino acids, and nutrient transporter 
subfamilies. (2) However, these subfamilies are considerably less explored than the MAT subfamily.
