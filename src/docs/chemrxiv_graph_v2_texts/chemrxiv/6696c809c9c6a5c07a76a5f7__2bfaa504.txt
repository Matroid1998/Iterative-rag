Description:
Has a shorter atmospheric lifetime but significantly higher heat-trapping potential compared to carbon dioxide.

Text:
Methane has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, but significantly higher heattrapping potential com
pared to carbon dioxide (CO2). As a result, methane reduction actions taken today will have a more
significant shortterm impact than CO2 reduction efforts. Human activities are responsible for ap
proximately 60 of global methane, with the oil and gas, agriculture (including fermentation, manure
management, and rice cultivation), landfills, wastewater treatment, and coal mining industries as the
largest contributors to anthropogenic methane emissions 1. In 2022, natural gas and petroleum systems were responsible for 28 of US methane emissions 1. Tackling oil and gas methane emissions is considered as one of the most economically and technically
effective ways of lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the near term 2.

Description:
A greenhouse gas with significant climate impact, often leaked and vented from the oil and gas sector.

Text:
In addition to its
climate impact, leaked and vented methane from the oil and gas sector results in substantial economic
losses in terms of lost sales and social costs 3. Several studies using various emissions measurement techniques report that the existing emission
inventories underestimate actual methane emissions from the oil and gas sector 417 with significant
regional variability in the scale of discrepancies between inventories and measurementbased estimates. A recent study reported that methane emission loss rates range from approximately 0.75 to 9.63
of natural gas production in different geographical areas in the US 18.
