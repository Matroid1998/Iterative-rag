The ability to control molecular structure and properties through external stimuli opens avenues for the design and development of 
advanced materials for applications involving organic electronics, sensing, biomedical research, molecular machines, and energy 
storage.1,2,3 In this context, indigoid photoswitches such as 3 or 2oxindole derivatives (Fig. 1), represent an intriguing class of 
molecules, characterized by their reversible photoisomerization and tunable electronic structures. Oxindoleindolone derivatives (3
oxindole called oxindoles or 2oxindole derivatives named azaaurones or hemiindigos) are typically synthesized via the Knoevenagel 
reaction, which involves a condensation of an aldehyde, or ketone with the respective active hydrogen compounds to form a carbon
carbon double bond (Fig. 1). Traditionally, the Knoevenagel reaction is conducted in solution under homogeneous conditions.

Description:
Products of the solvent-free mechanochemical Knoevenagel reaction with high yields.

Text:
In this study, we demonstrate that the solventfree 
mechanochemical procedure of the Knoevenagel reaction yields hemiindigos, hemithioindigos, and oxindoles in high yields, requires 
short reaction times, and tolerates a wide scope of reagents. The reaction is selective in regards to the doublebond stereochemistry 
and allows for stereoselective synthesis of multichromophoric and complex macrocyclic derivatives. The photophysical properties of 
selected new products are also reported.
