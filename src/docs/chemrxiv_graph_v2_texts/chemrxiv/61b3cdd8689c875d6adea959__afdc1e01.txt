Description:
A component of metalloenzymes that perform redox chemistry in polysaccharide monooxygenases.

Text:
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs; also designated PMOs) are copper 
metalloenzymes that perform unique redox chemistry resulting in disruption of polysaccharide chains by 
oxygen atom insertion at the glycosidic bond.1 The LPMO active site contains a mononuclear Cu2 center 
within a histidine brace motif in which the copper is coordinated by the Nterminal histidine amino 
group, the Nd atom of His1 and the Ne atom of a second conserved histidine.2 Of particular commercial 
and biotechnological interest is the ability of fungal LPMOs to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of 
recalcitrant crystalline cellulose at the C1 andor C4 position, thereby enhancing polysaccharide 
depolymerization by increasing glucan access to hydrolytic enzymes via the overall reaction shown in 
Scheme 1.35 

Scheme 1 Oxidation of the C1C4 carbon in the glycosidic bond catalyzed by LPMOs with oxygen as the 
cosubstrate.

H atoms to be abstracted by the reactive oxygen species shown in green. While H2O2 has also been shown to be a LPMO cosubstrate,6 the work presented here focuses on 
the activation of O2, the first characterized cosubstrate in polysaccharide oxidation and the substrate in 
the synthesis of H2O2 in absence of substrate.35 Oneelectron reduction of the copper active site to Cu1 
and binding of the molecular oxygen cosubstrate initiates the reaction cycle with the generally accepted
