Description:
Proved viability as a catalyst in PEMWEs.

Text:
Despite decades 
of research, no marketable alternative consisting of cheap 
earthabundant elements has emerged to replace this scarce 
and expensive noble metal catalyst, necessitating impactful 
materials innovation. Catalysts in commercial PEMWEs 
applications must not only be active but also durable over an 
extended time. The particular challenge lies in overcoming the 
inherent instability of nonnoble metals at lower pHs, which is 
the operating environment of PEMWEs. Recently, some promising demonstrations have proved the 
viability of Co and Mnbased oxides. For instance, Mondschein 
et al.
