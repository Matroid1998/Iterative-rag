Description:
Regenerated via chemical or electrochemical reduction in catalytic versions of the Wittig reaction.

Seventy years ago, Georg Wittig reported a groundbreaking reaction that revolutionized synthetic 
organic chemistry the Wittig olenation.13 This reaction, which converts carbonyl compounds into their 
unsaturated analogues via a 22 pericyclic mechanism, remains one of the most fundamental and 
extensively utilized transformations for the synthesis of functional alkenes.36 Despite numerous 
adaptations, the classical Wittig reaction continues to be crucial in modern synthetic chemistry, with 
applications ranging from polymer chemistry79 and material sciences10,11 to drug and natural product 
synthesis.1217 Even on an industrial scale, the Wittig reaction is frequently pivotal; a prominent example 
is BASFs tonscale synthesis of vitamin A and its derivatives.5,1823 
In light of growing environmental concerns, there is an urgent need for more sustainable and greener 
modications of this widely used reaction.23 Recent eorts have focused on developing catalytic versions 
of the Wittig reaction, using strategies to regenerate phosphine via chemical or electrochemical 
reduction of the resulting phosphine oxide.2428 Although these methods can recycle byproducts, they 
often generate wasteful byproducts themselves, for example when using chemical reductants like 
phenyl silane (PhSiH3).24 Additionally, attempts to use water as a reaction medium have been made,2934 
but the energyintensive process of treating aqueous chemical waste often mitigates any environmental 
and cost benets.35,36 Thus, the development of more sustainable and environmentally benign 
olenation processes remains a signicant challenge.
