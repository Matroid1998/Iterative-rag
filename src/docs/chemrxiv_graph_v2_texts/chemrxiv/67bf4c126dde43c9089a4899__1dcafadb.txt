Description:
A compound used as a proton acceptor with altered acid-base properties upon excitation.

Text:
In this study, we chose 7hydroxycoumarinyl4acetic acid (7HC) as the PA 
D and 6aminoquinoline (6AQ) as the PB A, respectively (Fig. 1c), which were designed to have 
similar excitation energies to initiate the PT process in a controlled manner (2224). Upon 
excitation, the acidbase properties of PAs and PBs are altered, resulting in a giant excitedstate 
pKa gap (pKa11, see below), which serves as the PMF for the PT across the bridge (Fig. 1c). Here, we synthesized unnatural amino acids (UAAs) containing the PA and PB, thus enabling the 
use of solidphase peptide synthesis (SPPS) to incorporate the proton D and A at desired positions 
within peptides.
