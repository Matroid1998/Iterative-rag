Description:
A material used in thin film applications, where increasing its thickness can enhance absorption and reduce reflectivity.

Text:
This cause a devia
tion from the Kirchhoffs law, resulting in decrease of the photo
thermal conversion efficiency, i.e., lighttoabsorbed energy con
version. By increasing the thickness of Cr film (base in MIM)
from 5 nm to 50 nm, the absorption loss due to Cr is moderately
increased, resulting in a nonreflective and highabsorptive state
of metasurface17.
