Description:
The amount emitted by industrial ammonia synthesis is equivalent to 1.4% of total human emissions.

Text:
Ammonia is an essential chemical for human society as a raw material for artificial fertilizers. Its production 
is mainly synthesized in largescale plants at a rate of 150 to 180 million tons per year, increasing by 2.3 per 
year 1. Ammonia is also attracting attention as a renewable energy carrier since it can be synthesized from 
hydrogen obtained by water electrolysis using surplus electricity from solar and wind power generation 1,2. While hydrogen needs to be lowered to about 240C to liquefy at 1 MPa, ammonia easily liquefies at room 
temperature at 1 MPa, thus liquefied ammonia has a higher energy density and is a superior energy carrier3. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by industrial ammonia synthesis is equivalent to 1.4  of total human 
emissions4.
