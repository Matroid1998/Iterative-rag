Description:
An element that is a nearest neighbor of carbon and forms compounds like boron nitride.

Text:
In the case of the nearest neighbors of carbon, boron and nitrogen, equiatomic 
cubic boron nitride (cBN) has been synthesized, which is half as hard as diamond but exhibits 
much higher thermal and chemical stability 3. Research efforts to identify new superhard phases of compounds of light elements require the 
use of structure prediction programs such as USPEX 4 and CALYPSO 5. However, novel 
structures can also be identified through the application of crystal engineering rationale as 
presented here. In all cases, such predictions must be validated by the quantitative study of 
energies and the derived physical properties using firstprinciples calculations. Over the years, 
the wellestablished quantum mechanics framework of the density functional theory (DFT) 6,7 
has proven to be the most efficient.
