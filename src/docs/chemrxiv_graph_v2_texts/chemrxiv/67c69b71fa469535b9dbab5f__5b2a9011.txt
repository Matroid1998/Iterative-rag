A naturally occurring compound known for its antioxidant properties.

Text:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring compound that belongs to the class of 
phytoalexins, antimicrobial chemical substances produced by plants to combat 
infection by a pathogen.1 It is wellknown for its antioxidant properties26 and is 
commonly found in grapes and peanuts.7 Although its most stable isomeric form 
is trans,8 upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, resveratrol undergoes 
photoisomerization, originating its cis configuration.911 The experimentally

Can undergo photoexcited reactions resulting in byproducts.

determined molar yield of cisresveratrol generated from transresveratrol 
excitation (in a hydroalcoholic solution exposed to solar irradiation) was 
approximately 60 and underwent significant degradation after 150 minutes.12 
This interconversion was detailed in several computational and experimental 
works, demonstrating that the isomerization process is consistently observed for 
transresveratrol, in both solution and solid phases. 11,13 
In addition to isomerization, photoexcited resveratrol can undergo reactions that 
result in byproducts (Figure 1).
