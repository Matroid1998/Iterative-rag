Description:
Frequently forms quaternary centers in bioactive natural products, pharmaceuticals, and drug candidates.

However, as a community, we are 
realizing trends that indicate enhanced developability and 
clinical success of organic molecules that exhibit greater 
degrees of saturation, which is often correlated with increasing 
numbers 
of 
sp3hydridized 
carbons.1 
This 
molecular 
complexity tends to improve a compounds aqueous solubility, 
crystallinity, and binding specificity.2 Allcarbon quaternary 
centers are frequently encountered in bioactive natural 
products, pharmaceuticals, and drug candidates (Figure 1).3 
In a recent analysis of modern Negishi, Suzuki, and various 
nickelcatalyzed photoredox crosscoupling methods for 
constructing C(sp2)C(sp3) arylalkyl bonds by Abbvie scientists, 
none were able to install a tertbutyl group.2b This highlights the 
challenges inherent in synthesizing quaternary carbon centers, 
as well as the limitations that exist even with stateoftheart 
catalysis.
