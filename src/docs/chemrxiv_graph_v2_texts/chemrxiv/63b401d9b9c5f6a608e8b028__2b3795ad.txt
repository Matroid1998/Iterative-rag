Description:
Compounds produced through hydrolysis and prepared via the Rochow direct process.

Text:
Most of them are produced through the 
hydrolysis of chlorosilanes that are prepared via Rochow direct 
process,4,5,6 then the associated production of cyclics (mainly 
D3 and D4) that are subsequently polymerized in the presence 
of a based catalyst.7 Although Silicon (Si) is an abundant 
elemental in the earth, the production of the Si metal grade 
necessary for the Direct Process is highly energyintensive 
requiring extremely high temperature (1400C).8 Moreover, it 
also releases a substantial amount of greenhouse gases 
detrimental to our environment.9 Recycling of outofspecs or 
endoflife polydimethylsiloxanes to valueadded compounds 
such as cyclic monomers or functional oligomers thus emerges 
as a highly desirable and potentially sustainable solution.
