Description:
A type of PFAS included in limited chemical analyses.

Text:
As a result of these restrictions and of the voluntary phaseout of PFOS and its precursors 
61 
by their main manufacturer (3M) between 2000 and 2002, the production of PFAS shifted 
62 
towards new structures and now over 4700 PFAS have been listed 26, 27. Despite the 
63 
numerosity of PFAS, in most epidemiological studies only a limited number of these chemicals 
64 
is analyzed, including the perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) and few other PFAS, like 
65 
perfluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSA), fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTS) and fluorotelomer 
66 
alcohols (FTOH) 28, 29. Measuring only these compounds is not sufficient to describe the 
67 
full extent of internal exposure to PFAS. In serum of Swedish women only 11  75  of 
68 
extractable organic fluorine could be explained by 17 target PFAS 30.
