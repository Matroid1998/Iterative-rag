Description:
A valuable compound that can be synthesized from smaller molecules like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane.

Text:
The modern world is dependent on heterogeneous catalysis, which is essential to important
industrial processes in synthesizing highdemand chemicals and materials. There are many
catalytic systems of interest which need to be described in great detail, such as upgrading
heavy crude oils1 and converting small molecules like carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide
(CO2), and methane (CH4) into larger and more valuable compounds such as ethylene or
hydrocarbon fuels.2 Acquiring intimate knowledge of both adsorbed and gasphase species for
one industrially relevant process on a single catalyst is both time consuming and challenging,
