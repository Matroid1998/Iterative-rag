Description:
Compounds that can easily undergo chemical reactions with the loading of mechanical force.

Text:
These specially designed molecules, called mechanophores, are a group of 
compounds that can easily undergo chemical reactions with loading of a mechanical force.5 Notably, 
the mechanophores are usually embedded into long polymer chains to allow the transduction of 
mechanical force.3c,5 Owing to the pioneering works in this field, a series of mechanophores were 
synthesized and subsequently investigated, such as gemdihalocyclopropanes (gDHC),6
