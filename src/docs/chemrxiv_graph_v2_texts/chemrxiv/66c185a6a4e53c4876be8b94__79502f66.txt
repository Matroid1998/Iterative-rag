Description:
Simpler systems have demonstrated tractability at near ambient pressures using machine learning surrogate models for DFT and first-principles thermodynamics.

Specifically, the pressurecomposition
temperature (PCT) phase behavior of the LuNH sys
tem has yet to be predicted, i.e., the expected N and H
concentrations as a function of N and H chemical poten
tials (temperatures and partial pressures). More gener
ally, quantitative prediction of PCT behavior 2628 is
difficult due to the computational cost of density func
tional theory (DFT) and the required highthroughput
sampling of the potential energy surface of hydrogen
and metal alloy interactions; nonetheless, tractability has
been demonstrated for simpler metal hydride systems at
near ambient pressures by combining machine learning
surrogate models for DFT and firstprinciples thermo
dynamics 29.
