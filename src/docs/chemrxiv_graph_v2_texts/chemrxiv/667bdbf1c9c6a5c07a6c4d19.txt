Description:
An oxygen donor used in nonhydrolytic polycondensation reactions to form metalsilicon oxides.

Text:
The NHSG method relies on nonhydrolytic polycondensation reactions 
between metalsilicon precursors and oxygen donors other than water under nonaqueous 
conditions and leads to the formation of metalsilicon oxides.3 These reaction rates are usually 
lower and level off compared to ones under aqueous environments, leading to the formation of 
materials with wellcontrolled properties such as homogeneity, composition, morphology, 
texture, and surface chemistry.
