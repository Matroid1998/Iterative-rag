Description:
Varietal compounds that contribute to fruity attributes and varietal characters in wines.

Text:
These changes tend to be 
24 
harmful to the overall aroma of white wines, as important volatiles such as esters and varietal thiols that endow 
25 
fruity attributes and varietal characters could be easily compromised.56 However, the focus of ageingrelated 
26 
oxidative studies of wine aroma is on the changes that occur after prolonged storage for months or years, 
27 
whereas the rapid oxidation events that occur in wine within several weeks of its exposure to an oxygenrich 
28 
atmosphere are not as widely studied. 29 
An indirect perspective to approach this rarely researched phenomenon is the consumption rates of oxygen in 
30 
O2enriched wine. For instance, Ferreira et al.

Description:
React readily with oxidation-induced reactive species, leading to aroma loss.

Text:
reported that red wines enriched with oxygen from air (5.56.5 
31 
mgL dissolved O2) exhibited fast initial consumption rate of O2 (averaged as 3.82 mgL in the first day of 
32 
oxidation).7 A high initial consumption rate of O2 was similarly observed by the same group in white and rose 
33 
wines, with copper, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamic acids shown to be the determining factors of the O2 
34 
consumption rate.8 Such findings were corroborated more recently by Kontoudakis and Clark, in that copper can 
35 
drastically increase the rate of oxygen uptake in aerated wine within a short time frame.9 
36 
Additionally from the aroma perspective, Nikolantonaki and Waterhouse have reported that the firstorder 
37 
reaction constant  between 4methyl1,2benzoquinone (a model quinone) and an important varietal thiol, 3
38 
mercaptohexanol (3MH), is 0.0578 s1, corresponding to the halflife of 3MH in this reaction as 12.0 s (calculated 
39 
as 
ln 2
).10 Although in reality the rate of quinonethiol reactions would be governed by other external factors such 
40 
as the presence of antioxidants, varietal thiols react readily with oxidationinduced reactive species, which 
41 
subsequently leads to aroma loss.
