Description:
A very nonpolar solvent used under appropriate conditions with a suitable supporting electrolyte.

However, a wide range of solvents can be used under appropriate conditions, including 
even very nonpolar solvents such as hexane provided a suitable supporting electrolyte is added.5 
That particular innovation comes with the considerable downside that the last thing most people 
wish to put in their instrument is a hexanesoluble ionic compound, which tend to have very high

surface activity, causing ion suppression and contamination of the source. As such, alternative 
solvents that support the necessary electrochemistry but do not require the added electrolyte are 
desirable, and we and others have tried many different options.
