Description:
A zinc-based zeolitic imidazolate framework effective as an adsorbent for organic dyes and carbon dioxide.

However, it is hard to find effective materials that can be used as adsorbents 
and photocatalysts simultaneously. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) such as zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are porous 
materials with the potential for various applications, including energy production and drug delivery 
10,1629. ZIFsbased materials such as ZIF8 (zincbased ZIFs) were reported as an effective 
adsorbent for organic dyes and carbon dioxide (CO2) 22,30,31. They can be classified to 1) pure ZIF
8; 2) nanoparticles modified ZIF8 such as ZnOZIF8 32,33; and 3) ZIF8derived ZnO loaded 
carbon (ZnONdoped C) 34. Despite ZIF8 exhibiting high performance as an adsorbent, it shows 
low photocatalytic performance due to its large bandgap (5.0 eV)35. ZnO exhibited high 
photocatalysis compared to ZIF83638.
