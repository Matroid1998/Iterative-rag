Description:
Hydrocarbons that can undergo copolymerization with gaseous SO2.

Text:
The copolymerization of olefins with gaseous SO2 presents an effective method for 
the direct preparation of aliphatic polysulfones (Fig. 1A). However, this 
copolymerization is constrained by the influence of ceiling temperature (Tc), above
