Description:
The basal planes are generally chemically inert with interactions driven by van der Waals forces.

Text:
This tunability directly stems from their hexagonal symmetry
structure, where each Mo atom is intricately coordinated by six neigh
boring chalcogen atoms (S, Se, or Te), forming strong covalent bonds
and adopting a trigonalprismatic geometry through the hybridization
of molybdenums sd5 orbitals. This structural arrangement results in
a lack of coordinatively unsaturated surface sites, rendering the basal
planes of materials like MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 generally chemi
cally inert, with most external interactions primarily driven by van der
Waals (vdW) forces. Moreover, the distinctive bonding configuration in
these sheets results in the outwardprojecting pz orbitals of chalcogen
atoms contributing to the valence band maximum (VBM). This feature
enables effective charge transfers, even in cases where surface interac
tions are relatively weak 18, 19.

One such promising application of TMDs capitalizes on their sensi
tivity to surface interactions and low chemical reactivity is gas sensing. Thanks to their exceptional surfacetovolume ratio, TMDs hold the po
tential for robust responses, even at room temperature (RT), provided
that the permolecule transfer rates are sufficiently high for the target
analyte. As a result, materials such as MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 have
exhibited remarkable sensitivity to NO2, facilitating excellent detection
limits even under RT conditions 2023.

Description:
A material with a narrow bandgap, making it suitable for detecting NO2 at room temperature and enhancing recovery through illumination.

Text:
In response to this challenge, researchers have demonstrated that rapid
recovery can be achieved by employing gate bias and light illumina
tion techniques 20, 22, 24 In this context, all Mobearing TMDs offer
distinct advantages. However, among them, MoTe2 appears to hold the
greatest potential for detecting NO2 at room temperature. This is due
to its narrow bandgap, which also makes it wellsuited for recovery
enhancement through illumination. Another pertinent issue relates to selectivity. Mobearing TMDs
exhibit exceptionally high sensitivity specifically to NO2. While this
attribute enhances their selectivity for NO2, it simultaneously restricts
the broader utility of TMDbased sensors in gas sensing applications.
