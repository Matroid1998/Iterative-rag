Description:
Involved in classical transformations such as reductions, 1,2-addition reactions, and arylations.

Aromatic ketones are invaluable synthetic intermediates 
that can be converted into a diverse array of compounds not 
only through classical carbonyl transformations such as re
ductions, 1,2addition reactions, and arylations, but also 
via transition metalcatalyzed aromatic ring CH function
alization at the ortho position (Figure 1A).1620 In contrast, 
deacylative transformations, which employ the acyl group 
of the aromatic ketones as a leaving group to introduce var
ious functional groups on the aromatic ring at the ipso posi
tion, are infrequently reported. The development of deacyl
ative transformations that utilize aromatic ketones as ary
lating agents is significant, as it presents a novel method for 
derivatizing the aromatic ketone skeleton, further enhanc
ing its value as a synthetic intermediate.
