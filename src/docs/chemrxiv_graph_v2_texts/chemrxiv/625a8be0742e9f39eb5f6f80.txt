Description:
Used as gate materials in ISFET devices for amino acid functionalization.

Text:
Since 1952, when Shockley invented FieldEffect 
Transistors (FETs); there have been undergoing 
many significant modifications to cater to the needs 
of 
sensing 
applications. In 
1970, 
Bergveld 
developed an ionsensitive FieldEffect Transistor 
(ISFET) which is used for ion detection in a 
chemical environment. With further development of 
technology, novel functionalizations for ISFET 
devices have been fabricated for protein and DNA 
detection. Various simulations have been carried out 
to further deepen the knowledge of the impact of 
functionalizations on the performance parameters 
1. In this paper, analytical simulations have been 
carried out to effectively simulate the Gouy
ChapmanStern model with the SiteBinding model 
for different amino acid functionalized on various 
types of gate oxides. Further, we plan on integrating 
numerical TCAD simulations with this work. II.
