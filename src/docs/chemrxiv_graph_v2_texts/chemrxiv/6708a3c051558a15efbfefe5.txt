Description:
Subject to corrosion, which affects the integrity of infrastructure and products through electrochemical reactions.

Text:
Iron and steel are not only used in infrastructure but are fundamental to modern construction, 
symbolizing strength, reliability, and durability. However, corrosion, the gradual deterioration 
of materials through electrochemical reactions with their environment remains a persistent 
challenge across various industries. The corrosion of iron and steel affects the integrity of large
scale infrastructure, transportation networks and even the lifespan of everyday products.14 
Despite advancements in materials science and the development of corrosion prevention 
strategies, such as the use of inhibitors, iron corrosion continues to pose serious safety and 
economic concerns worldwide.

Investigated for its oxidation processes at the atomic scale.

Text:
To advance our understanding of corrosion mechanisms at the atomic level and to develop 
corrosion mitigation strategies, computational approaches, particularly density functional 
theory (DFT), have become valuable tools.3,710 DFT enables researchers to probe atomic
scale interactions, providing insight into the energetics, adsorption behaviour, reaction 
mechanisms, and electronic properties of materials in corrosive environments.1116 
In the last two decades, numerous DFT studies have been conducted to investigate iron 
oxidation processes at the atomic scale. Since water and oxygen are the main corrosive agents, 
most studies have focused on how these agents interact with the crystallographic surface planes 
of iron. For example, Eder et al. investigated the water dissociation energies on Fe(100) and
