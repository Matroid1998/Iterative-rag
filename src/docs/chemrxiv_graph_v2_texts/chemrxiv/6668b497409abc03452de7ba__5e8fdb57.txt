Description:
Molecules with excited states that can be compared to the ground state in terms of electronic energy.

Text:
The analysis is based
on the exact solutions of the extended Heitler
London model, allowing us to rigorously quan
tify the contributions of kinetic exchange inter
actions and effective Coulomb interactions to
the overall bonding. Furthermore, we extend
our investigation to the excited states of hydro
gen molecules and discuss how they compare to
the ground state. Method
The total electronic energy of a system is
expressed as the sum of the kinetic interac
tion part energy. The kinetic energy term in
HartreeFock corresponds to the average kinetic
energy of noninteracting electrons in the effec
tive potential generated by the other electrons.
