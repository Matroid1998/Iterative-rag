Catalyst offering a general platform for C(sp3)C(sp2) cross-electrophile coupling reactions.

Extensive pro
gress has been made in developing C(sp3)C(sp2) crosselectro
phile coupling reactions, with Ni catalysis offering a particu
larly general platform.2 Mechanistic studies on select Nicata
lyzed reactions have revealed that distinct, hybridizationde
pendent activation mechanisms give rise to the crossselectivity 
with C(sp2) and C(sp3) electrophiles.3,4 In contrast, methods for 
selective coupling of two C(sp3) electrophiles remain underde
veloped, owing to the more subtle differences in reactivity be
tween the two reaction partners (Figure 1A).5 Nevertheless, 
there has been important recent progress made in this area using 
Ni6 or Cu catalysis7 with chemical reductants and electrochem
ical methods.8 These approaches typically rely on substrate stoi
chiometry, differences in (pseudo)halide identities or differ
ences in substitution at the carbon center to achieve selectivity.
