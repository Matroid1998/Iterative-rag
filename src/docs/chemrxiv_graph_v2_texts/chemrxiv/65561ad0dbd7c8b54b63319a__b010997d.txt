Description:
N-doped graphene SACs feature an isolated metal atom and exhibit enhanced catalytic activity.

Text:
Their unique electronic structure and unsaturated coordination 
environments have led to enhanced catalytic activity across numerous reactions39, 40. Among 
different classes of SACs, Ndoped graphene SACs25, 28, 41, featuring an isolated metal atom
