Description:
Nanoclusters exhibit remarkable properties arising from quantum confinement and discrete electronic structures.

The synthesis of copper (Cu) nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged 
relatively recently compared to their gold (Au) and silver (Ag) 
counterparts, primarily due to the inherent challenges in 
stabilizing the NCs during synthesis, which are prone to 
oxidation 
and 
decomposition, 
especially 
at 
ambient 
conditions.15 
However, 
recent 
advances 
in 
synthetic 
methodologies have made it possible to stabilize Cu NCs.6, 7 
Early efforts focused on Cuhydride NCs, which are stable at low 
temperatures, but the development of thiolate and alkyne
capped Cu NCs has since enabled the stabilization of these 
clusters under ambient conditions.713 After stabilization, Cu 
NCs exhibit remarkable properties arising from quantum 
confinement and their discrete electronic structures.
