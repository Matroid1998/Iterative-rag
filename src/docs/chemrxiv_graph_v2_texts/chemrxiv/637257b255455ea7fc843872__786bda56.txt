Description:
A fuel produced through the hydrogenation of CO2.

as in the course of CO2 hydrogenation towards methanol fuel, again key in making carbon 
economy circular 12. Thus, the interaction of CO with TMbased catalysts has gained 
importance as a way, not only to gain atomistic insights of the latter using CO as a probe 
molecule, but also as a crucial species in diverse processes of industrial and environmental 
relevance. Thus, a systematic investigation of the CO interaction with TMs and its possible 
dissociation would not only allow the discovery of the key, acting descriptors unfolding the 
physicochemical properties of TM surfaces and set a predicting basis for complex systems, 
e.g. TM nanoparticles 13 and bimetallic structures 14. It could also drive the description of
