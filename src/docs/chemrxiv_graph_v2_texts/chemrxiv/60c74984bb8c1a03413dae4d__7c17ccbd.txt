Description:
An accessory cofactor in PSII that acts as a primary electron donor.

Text:
Bacterial reaction centers (BRCs)
containing the electron donors P870 and P960 can be found in Rhodobacter sphaeroides
and Rhodopseudomonas viridis, respectively 1. Note that the numbers correspond to
the absorption maxima of those complexes. The primary electron donors of PSI and the
BRC are pairs of inner (B)Chl a 2,3, which are called the special pair (SP) in cases of
BRCs 4 (for an overview on RC structures, see Sec. 2). In case of PSII, the primary
electron donor is composed of an accessory Chl a cofactor 3. Being excited by the deliv
ered energy, these primary electron donors donate an electron forming shortlived radical
pairs with neighboring cofactors (for more detail, see Refs. 2, 3).
