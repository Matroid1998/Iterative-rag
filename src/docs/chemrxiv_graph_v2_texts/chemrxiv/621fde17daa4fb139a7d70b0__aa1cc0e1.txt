The NiVO chemical system contains multi
ple ternary compounds with intriguing mag
netic and electronic properties. Ni3V2O8 forms
a Kagome staircase structure with four low
temperature magnetic transitions1,2 and has
emerged as a component in new supercapaci
tors.36 Both NiV3O8, a ferromagnet with tran
sitions at 2 and 27 K,7 and Ni2V2O7, a 3D spin
1 antiferromagnet,8 have shown promising
electrochemical properties for Liion battery
