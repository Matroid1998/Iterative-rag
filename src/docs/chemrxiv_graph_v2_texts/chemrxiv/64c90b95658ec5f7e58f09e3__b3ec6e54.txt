Description:
A nonmetallic element vital to biogeochemical cycles and biosynthesis.

Exposure to excessive amounts of Cu2 can lead to various 
88 
disruptive effects and impairment of biological processes (Dave, 1984; Kramer et al., 2009; 
89 
Lamb et al., 2012; Saadani et al., 2016; Igiri et al., 2018; Tylor et al., 2020). 90 
Sulfur is a nonmetallic element vital to biogeochemical cycles and biosynthesis 
91 
(Giordano et al., 2004; Lucheta and Lambais, 2012) and is amply available in different 
92 
forms, such as sulfate SO42, which is prevalent in water (Giordano et al., 2004; WHO, 
93 
2004; Boone et al., 2012). Sulfate levels in freshwater are generally around 20 mgL (WHO 
94 
2004), whilst the Secondary Maximum Contaminant Level (SMCL) for sulfate in drinking 
95 
water is 250 mgL (Webb and Czapar, 2013).
