Description:
A compound involved in fixation processes to produce high-value-added chemicals and renewable fuels.

Text:
The significance of CO2 fixation is selfevident, as it can close the loop of the anthropogenic carbon 
cycle, additionally allowing production of highvalueadded chemicals, e.g. renewable fuels.1 
Photocatalytic CO2 fixation is one of the strategies where sunlight is used as the sole energy input 
to drive CO2 reduction into valuable fuels or chemicals. To implement this photocatalytic approach, 
an efficient catalyst is required to have good selectivity of product formation from the CO2 
reduction reaction, while a photosensitizer should be used to harvest solar light and provide 
photogenerated electrons.
