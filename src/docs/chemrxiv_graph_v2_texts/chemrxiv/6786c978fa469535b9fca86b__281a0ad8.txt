Description:
A key precursor material for the synthesis of cathode materials, preferred for its lower calcination temperature of around 650 C.

Currently, the 
methods used in the purification process require large amounts of hazardous chemicals as well as long
duration and energyintensive steps to produce the final material. Mainstream cathode materials such 
as LiCoO2, LiNixMnyCozO2 or LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 employ lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium 
hydroxide (LiOH) as key precursor materials for their synthesis, with LiOH being preferred due to the 
lower calcination temperature of around 650 C required to obtain the oxide cathode materials from 
LiOH as opposed to around 900 C for lithium carbonate.3,4 In the case of LiOH production from hard
rock minerals, acidroasting of the spodumene mineral with sulphuric acid produces a lithium 
sulphate (Li2SO4) leachate. The subsequently purified leachate would then be converted into the 
desired LiOH by reacting with caustic soda.
