Description:
A hydrogenated analogue of the sesquiterpene farnesane used to reduce sooting tendency in jet fuel.

Text:
The sootiness of terpenes relative to conventional 
jet fuel is not obvious terpenes are usually not 
aromatic and they often contain oxygen, which can 
suppress soot formation 15, but they also contain 
structural features that enhance soot formation such 
as double bonds and rings 16. Donoso et al. have 
demonstrated 
that 
turpentinederived 
terpene 
mixtures can have lower sooting tendencies than 
conventional jet fuel, and that hydrogenating them 
reduces sooting tendency further 2. Zschocke et al. have shown that adding the hydrogenated analogue 
of 
the 
sesquiterpene 
farnesane 
(2, 6, 10trimethyldodecane) to Jet A1 reduces 
sooting tendency 17. The objective of this study is to systematically 
investigate the sooting behavior of terpenes and 
their hydrogenated analogues.
