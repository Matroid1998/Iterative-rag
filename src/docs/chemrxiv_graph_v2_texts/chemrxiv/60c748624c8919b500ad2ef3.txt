Description:
Considered as an operation condition in the evaluation of PEM fuel cells.

Text:
The experimentally resulted data shows the performance of a PEMFC at several percent of 
membrane compression, different applied voltages, different pressure of H2O2 gas, and various 
humidity conditions of cathode and air, which can be used to study behavior of PEMFC that is 
necessary to research and development of fuel cells. In other words, the dataset help researchers 
and specialists who investigate and work on PEM fuel cells 1. Polarization and Impedance curves have obtained from specific empirical operation 
condition. MEA structure defines as composition of anode, membrane and cathode. Temperature 
of anode, cathode and cell, pressure and flow rate of H2O2 (ml.min1) have been considered as 
operation condition during the evaluation.

Description:
Used in impedance analysis at different pressures during activation procedures.

Text:
In Polarization curves, cell voltage (V) per current 
density (mA.cm2) and cell power density (mW.cm2) per current density (mA.cm2) has been 
obtained at various relative humidity, gas pressure and membrane compression. Impedance 
analysis were done at the end of the each activation set and procedure at different cell voltages, 
relative humidity and H2O2 pressure. Also, in each activation procedure, analysis has been 
accomplished by repeat of activation sets 2. Obtained data can be useful for simulation of PEMFC and simulation has important role in 
scientific and applied studies.
