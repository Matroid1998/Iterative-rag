Description:
Prepared through direct nucleophilic substitution of alcohols.

Text:
For 
instance, nitrogen atom derivatizations are involved in about 80 of all heteroatom 
alkylation and arylation reactions in the synthesis of drug candidates.15 Thus, the 
development of sustainable amidecoupling techniques along with the direct nucleophilic 
substitution of alcohols (e.g., for preparation of amines) have been listed among the top 
green chemistry research priorities by the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry 
Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS GCIPR).16 Advances in employing mechanochemistry 
for constructing CN bonds relevant to API synthesis, including the preparation of 
hydantoin derivatives,1722 amides,2326 bioactive peptides,27,28 aliphatic and aromatic 
amines,2934 sulfonylurea drugs,35,36 hydrazones,37 and sydnones38 have been described in 
the literature.
