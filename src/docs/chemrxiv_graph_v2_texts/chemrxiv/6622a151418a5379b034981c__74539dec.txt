Description:
Undergo strongfield-induced ionization and fragmentation when exposed to laser pulses with peak intensities of about 1014 Wcm2.

Text:
Upon passing near the
molecule, fastcharged particles, such as electrons or alpha par
ticles, will create a short, strong electric field comparable to the
atomic scales. To mimic such strongfield excitation of molecules,
we can apply strongfield laser pulses in the laboratory environ
ment. Previously, strongfieldinduced ionization and fragmentation of
PAHs were studied with tabletop laser setups.912 In particu
lar, laser pulses with peak intensities of about 1014 Wcm2 in
teracting with PAHs have produced ionic species up to tetraca
tions.9 Investigations of the ultrafast ionization and fragmentation
of PAHs induced by highly energetic XUV photons have recently
gained attention in the scientific community for tracing down
mechanisms of photochemical reactions.
