Description:
A perovskite oxide ferroelectric that is not CMOS compatible and shows a critical thickness limit below which ferroelectricity disappears.

Ferroelectric (FE) memory devices including FE tun
nel junctions (FTJs) and FE fieldeffect transistors (Fe
FET) are identified as exciting platforms to realize brain
inspired and lowpower neuromorphic computing13. Developing new FEs that are compatible with com
plementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) pro
cess, has been a longlasting ambition, both techno
logically and scientifically. Unfortunately, the well
known perovskite oxide FEs such as PbZrTiO3 (PZT)
are not CMOS compatible and generally show a crit
ical thickness limit below which ferroelectricity disap
pears due to the unscreened depolarization field4.
