Description:
Similar in structure to hexagonal boron nitride, with a two-dimensional hexagonal pattern.

This includes the 
voltammetric behavior at inlaid microdisk electrodes, put forth by Feldberg, who predicted 
peculiar deviations of the steadystate voltammograms from the commonlyused ButlerVolmer 
model of electrochemical kinetics.5 
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is arranged into twodimensional (2D) layers, in which 
boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bound in an alternating hexagonal pattern, similar to 
graphene. These layers are held together by van der Waals (vdW) forces in bulk hBN.

Description:
Exhibits increased carrier mobility when supported or encapsulated by hBN due to atomic flatness and lack of dangling bonds.

Text:
The lattice 
mismatch between hBN and graphene is only 1.5,67 their bulk interlayer spacing is nearly 
identical (3.33.4 ),78 and its polar nature renders hBN insulating, with a wide band gap of 6 
eV.910 These characteristics lead to an increased carrier mobility in graphene supported or 
encapsulated by hBN, owing to the atomic flatness, lack of dangling bonds, and suppression of 
charge doping at the graphenehBN interface.1113 It transpires from the present work that hBN is 
a suitable medium to study longrange electron tunneling, which leads to the observation of the 
MarcusHush behavior.
