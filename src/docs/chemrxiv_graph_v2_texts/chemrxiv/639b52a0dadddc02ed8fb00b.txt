Description:
Used in cryogenic single particle trapping experiments to measure adsorption kinetics of Ar atoms.

Text:
reported a 
cryogenic single particle trapping experiment in which the kinetics for adsorption of Ar atoms on 
silica NP was measured.15 These experiments detected the particles, and measured their motion 
in the trap optically, using either light scattering for large particles, or laserinduced fluorescence 
(LIF) for small particles. Recently we became interested in using NPMS as a method to measure 
kinetics for surface reactions of single NPs at high temperature, where NPs are detected, and 
their motion monitored, by measuring the thermal (blackbody) emission from the NPs, and 
fitting the emission spectra to determine the NP temperature (TNP).16, 17
