Description:
A compound that reacts with hydroxylamine to produce cyclohexanone oxime.

Text:
Cyclohexanone oxime is an important feedstock in the nitrogen industry as it can undergo 
Beckmann rearrangement to make caprolactam, the monomeric unit of Nylon6. With the 
annual global market of Nylon6 anticipated to be as high as 8.9 million tons by 2024,1 the 
production capacity of cyclohexanone oxime should also be expanded accordingly. To date, 
the majority of cyclohexanone oxime is produced by the nucleophilic additionelimination 
reaction between cyclohexanone and hydroxylamine (NH2OH),2 which is typically generated 
via hydrogenation of NOx on palladium catalysts3 or oxidation of ammonia (NH3) by O2H2O2 
(Figure 1a).46 However, these chemical processes generally require harsh reaction conditions 
(e.g. high temperatures andor pressures, strong acidicalkaline solutions), and therefore are 
challenged by a series of environmental and safety concerns.
