Description:
A nonrenewable resource used in medical applications, lasers, spectroscopy, and deep cooling.

Text:
The massive fossil fuel exploitation over the past century 
resulted in highly elevated levels of He in the atmosphere,2 while there is an ever craving need in the 
technology sector for He,3 for example in medical applications, such as MRI (magnet resonance 
imaging),4 or technological application in lasers, spectroscopy and deep cooling.5 Crude He sources 
are uncommon and have largely ceased exploitation due to their importance for the future of 
technology.6 He is a nonrenewable resource, thus generating strong interest in its separation from He
rich natural gas.2 While the components of Herich natural gas can be separated through cryogenic 
distillation, an energy efficient process can be developed from diffusion driven molecular sieving 
membrane technology.7 
Highly promising molecular sieving materials are MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs), hybrid materials 
consisting of inorganic metalcentres or clusters and organic linker molecules, which are connected via 
coordination bonds showcasing an extensive array of crystalline structures with a broad spreading from 
nonporous to highly porous networks.8 He is usually referred to as a nonadsorptive gas because it 
requires highly elevated pressure or very low temperatures to show condensation in pore systems, which 
is why diffusive separation is highly favoured instead.9 However, discussions have persisted regarding 
the molecular sieving capabilities of MOFs over recent years.10 This debate stems from the 
characteristics of the building blocks  the inorganic metal centre or cluster and the organic linker  
as well as the nature of their coordination bonds.11 While the building blocks offer numerous interesting 
features, they often render the frameworks unreliable for precise molecular sieving.12 This unreliability 
is primarily attributed to the flexibility of the organic components and the linkers, which can undergo 
rotational conformation changes and show thermal lattice vibrations,13 along with energetic hostguest 
interactions contributing to the socalled breathing effect14.
