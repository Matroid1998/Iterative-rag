Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries for electrochemical ion intercalation.

Text:
The charge storage mechanism of lithiumion batteries, as well as of novel cell chemistries 
beyond lithium, is based on electrochemical ion intercalation. The process involves the 
reversible storage of ions in a solidstate host electrode material that is typically undergoing 
small structural changes. Solidstate diffusion of the ions within the host lattice, as well as 
associated volumetric andor crystallographic phase changes of the host itself, can limit the 
kinetics of the intercalation reaction. To realize high power charge storage processes, 
strategies to mitigate such limitations are being developed from an electrode perspective 
across length scales, from the macroscopic particle size scale down to the microscopic atomic 
arrangement within the host.14 
Vanadium oxides are widely established as host materials for ion intercalation reactions.

Description:
A cation that can be hosted by the bilayered V2O5 phase.

Text:
The 
bilayered V2O5 phase (V2O5) is particularly versatile due to its ability to host a variety of 
cations, such as lithium, sodium, manganese, or zinc.5,6 It can further be synthesized by several 
wetchemical and hydrothermal methods, yielding a wide variety of attainable morphologies.7 
Thus, the material is suitable as a model system to explore electrochemical intercalation 
properties as a function of the host material structure and particularly its interlayer spacing. An emerging concept to reduce kinetic limitations in host materials is the direct tuning of 
lattice parameters, such as the interlayer spacing of layered and twodimensional materials, 
thereby modifying the nanoconfinement geometry within the host.
