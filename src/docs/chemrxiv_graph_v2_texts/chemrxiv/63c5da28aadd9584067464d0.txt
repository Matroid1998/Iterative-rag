Description:
Used in the design of redox mediators for oxidoreductase enzymes.

Text:
While many prior examples have demonstrated the design of diverse 
redox mediators, such as osmium complexes, quinones, methyl viologen, cobaltocene and 
ferrocene compounds for a variety of oxidoreductase enzymes, generally only three to five 
compounds were employed to evaluate the parameters that control electron transfer rates.1113 
Consequently, these insights may be less reliable in designing redox mediators for other enzyme 
systems. Additionally, a critical work by Kano and coworkers demonstrated the apparent 
importance of mediator electrostatics in dictating bioelectrocatalytic activity in a peroxidase 
biosensor.14 Specifically, increased charge density on the mediator was shown to enhance 
electrostatic interactions with peroxidase, thereby resulting in a higher electrochemical response.
