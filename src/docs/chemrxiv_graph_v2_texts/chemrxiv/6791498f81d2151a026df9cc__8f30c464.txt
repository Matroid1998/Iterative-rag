Description:
Part of the random distribution of metals in the crystal structure.

Text:
Atomic representation of the Al0.2Nb0.2Pt0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2B2 hexagonal crystal structured high entropy 
boride, the yellow spheres represent the boron atoms, and the purple spheres represent the random 
distribution of metals Al, Nb, Pt, Ta and Ti.
