In the context of global decarbonization, rechargeable
alkaliion batteries have become one of the key en
abling technologies for sustainable energy storage.13
Allsolidstate batteries (ASSBs) that incorporate inor
ganic solid electrolytes in place of ammable liquid elec
trolytes have drawn considerable attention due to their
potentially improved safety, and high power density.4
8 However, there are signicant challenges in developing
solid electrolytes for ASSBs, especially those related to
the interfacial instability with alkalimetal anodes.810
The interfacial stability in ASSBs largely depends on
the formation and chemical and electronic properties of
solidelectrolyte interphases (SEIs), which has been a
central topic of battery research.1113 Interfaces formed
between solid electrolytes and electrodes can be classied
into three types according to the formation and prop
erties of the SEIs13 (1) stable interfaces with no de
composition SEIs, (2) interfaces formed with SEIs that
conduct both electrons and alkali ions, and (3) interfaces
formed with stable SEIs that are electronically insulating.
