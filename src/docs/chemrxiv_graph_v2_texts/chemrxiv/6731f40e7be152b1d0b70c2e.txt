Description:
Pigments arranged in a highly symmetric manner in natural lightharvesting systems to promote efficient directional excitation energy flow.

Directed excitation energy transport at the nanoscale in supramolecular assemblies is of great 
importance for the development of new organic optoelectronic devices and nextgeneration solar 
cells.14 It is well known that the highly symmetric arrangement of the chlorophyll pigments in the 
natural lightharvesting systems promotes efficient directional excitation energy flow to the 
reaction center.59 This highly directed energy transport in such natural lightharvesting systems 
has been a great inspiration for their artificial counterparts, nanoantenna systems.
