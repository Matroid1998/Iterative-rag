Description:
Used to make plasticized membranes in low-cost ion-selective electrodes.

Text:
Analysis of selectivity coefficients, which 
describe the preference of the sensor towards the primary ion over others, indicates that in complex samples, with many interfering 
ions the response will be subject to considerable error. The problem can be solved by preparing calibration curves in the sample 
matrix, however one should expect much narrower linear range (as seen in the Fixed Interference Method)12. Variations in the 
electrode systems, liquidliquid junctions, calibration and measurement procedures are indicated in the guidelines for the analysis of 
blood samples as reasons why routine measurements can produce highly precise results, which might be far from being accurate13. In this work we have developed lowcost ionselective electrodes made from 2 mL disposable syringes equipped with plasticized 
PVC membranes.
