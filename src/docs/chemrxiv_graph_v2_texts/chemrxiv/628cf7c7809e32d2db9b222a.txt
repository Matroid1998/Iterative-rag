Description:
Molecular oxygen is critical for aerobic metabolism and is used in luminescent sensing to analyze concentration via photoluminescence.

Text:
Chemical and biochemical mechanisms of aerobic metabolism 
largely depend on molecular oxygen.13 Tumor hypoxia is 
associated with a variety of common diseases4 and therefore 
the sensing of triplet oxygen has been a recent area of 
interest.510 The level of molecular oxygen in tumors is a good 
indicator of metabolic state and can help guide therapy for 
cancer treatment. Beyond applications in pathology, accurate 
oxygen sensing with good spatial and temporal resolution is 
critical for monitoring physiological responses to extreme 
environments, e.g. subsea, arctic, and outer space.11 
Luminescent sensing of oxygen is particularly appealing, where 
the oxygen concentration is analyzed via the color, intensity, 
andor lifetime of photoluminescence.

Description:
Molecular triplet states are efficiently quenched by O2.

Text:
In principle any 
phosphorescent compound can serve as an oxygen sensor, 
since molecular triplet states are efficiently quenched by O2.12 
However, phosphorescent compounds give a turnoff 
response to oxygen, so their use requires accurate 
measurement of absolute luminescence intensity, which is 
prone to issues with calibration and reproducibility, resulting 
from variable excitation power, optical path length, and in 
biological applications heterogeneous cellular environments.13 
Measurement of the phosphorescence lifetime attenuation 
works well in principle for sensing oxygen but is more 
technically complex. Luminescent ratiometric oxygen sensors 
avoid these limitations by incorporating two emission signals 
which are differentially modulated by O2, and hence the ratio of 
the two emission intensities can provide a simple and accurate 
readout of oxygen concentration.
