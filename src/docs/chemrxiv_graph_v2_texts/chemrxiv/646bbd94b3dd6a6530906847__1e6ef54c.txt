Description:
A privileged structure due to its rigid and conjugated structure.

Text:
Coumarin and its natural and synthetic derivatives are a remarkable example of naturally 
based occurring heterocycle which presents an extensive range of pharmacological activities, 
including antibacterial (Kraljevi et al., 2016), antitubercular (Reddy, Hosamani  
Devarajegowda, 2015), sedativehypnotic (Gomha et al., 2020), antioxidante (Salar et al., 2016), 
antiinflammatory (Simijonovi et al., 2018), anticoagulant (Popov Aleksandrov et al., 2018), 
antileishmanial (Gonalves et al., 2020), and anticancer (Thakur, Singla  Jaitak, 2015; Emami  
Dadashpour, 2015; Dandriyal et al., 2016; Gomha, Abdelaziz  ElReedy, 2018; Akkol et al., 
2020). The 2Hchromen2one core is considered a privileged structure due to its rigid and 
conjugated structure.
