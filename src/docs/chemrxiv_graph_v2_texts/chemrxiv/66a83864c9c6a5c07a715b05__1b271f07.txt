Description:
A strong acid with a proton on the nitrogen atom, serving as an alternative to sulfonic acids.

Thus, 
the expansion of strong acid moieties in polymeric materials 
should advance materials and polymer science. In this regard, achievements in superacid chemistry could 
facilitate the replacement of sulfonic acids.3 Considering the 
acidity of sulfonic acids, bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Tf2NH, 
triflylimide) is the most suitable alternative to sulfonic acids.4 As 
shown in Scheme 1, the sulfonic acid bears a releasable 
hydrogen atom on the oxygen atom. However, Tf2NH features a 
strong acidic proton at the nitrogen atom, chemically and 
physically distinguishing it from its sulfonic acid counterparts.
