Description:
Used in nanoparticles as a more environmentally and health-friendly alternative to toxic heavy metals.

Text:
Colloidal nanoplatelets are ultrathin 2D nanomaterials
whose outstanding optical properties triggered a wide
research effort. (1) However they usually contain heavy
metals such as cadmium, (2, 3) lead (4) or mercury whose
toxicity is a drawback to their use wide acceptance. In the
quest for more environment and health benign materials,
indium based nanoparticles are often thought of as possible
alternatives. Among them, indium sulde is a wide band gap
semiconductor material which has useful properties such
as longterm stability and low toxicity when compared to
its toxic counterparts.

Description:
A metal used in the solvothermal synthesis of 2DInS nanomaterials.

Text:
showed
that nanoakes, spherical nanoparticles or nanobelts could
be obtained with the introduction of an appropriate metallic
ion in the initial mixture (20). Finally, starting from the same
type of precursors, other materials with different indium
oxidation states can be obtained. For instance, InS materials
may appear in four different allotropic varieties (orthorhom
bic, monoclinic, cubic and tetragonal) with the orthorhombic
Pnnm structure predicted to be the most stable (21). 1DInS
nanomaterials have already been reported in the form of
wires or rods (22), whereas 2DInS nanomaterials were ob
tained from a solvothermal synthesis between thioacetamide
and indium metal resulting in the formation of thin NR (23). Overall, the control of particle shape and atomic composition
in indium sulde nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the
synthesis parameters.
