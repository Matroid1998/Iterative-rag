Description:
Ion conductors promising for energy storage applications due to similar intercalation chemistry to Li.

Recently, sodium ion conductors have been reported to
be promising for energy storage applications because the
Na ion has a very similar intercalation chemistry to the
Li ion and, in some cases, the Na ionic radius is more
suitable for stabilizing fast ion conducting frameworks
because of its larger size compared with the Li ionic ra
dius. Thus, the development of sodium ion conducting
ASSB working at ambient temperatures is gaining re
newed attention. Recently, a unique class of heterostructures known as
honeycomb layered oxides has gained attention as high
energydensity electrodes and electrolyte materials for
their rich crystal chemistry that provides high cationic
conduction and high voltages using Na and K ions 15
