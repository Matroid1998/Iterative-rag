Description:
Elements known for forming azamacrocyclic complexes that bind to oxyanions.

In particular, as there exists a large literature on the synthesis of various derivatives of lanthanides azamacrocyclic 
complexes that bind to oxyanions.23,27,32,4251 
The mechanism of binding between a lanthanide(III) host and an oxyanion guest is most readily described in 
the scenario where the host is neutral and ion pairing effects can be ignored. Figure 1 shows this case, the equilibria 
involved, and the potential competitive binding events that change as a function of pH and media composition. Figure 1 includes two scenarios a europium(III) complex formed from a 7dentate ligand that create ternary
