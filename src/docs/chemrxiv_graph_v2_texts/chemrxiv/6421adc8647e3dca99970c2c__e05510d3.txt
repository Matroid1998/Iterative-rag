Description:
A molecule with both positive and negative charges, as found in lcysteine.

Text:
The amino acid lcysteine (Figure 1) is known to crystallise in two polymorphs at ambient
pressure. Form I is orthorhombic (P212121)1 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and
Form II is monoclinic (P21)2 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structures
of both forms have been studied at ambient temperatures; Form I by Xray1 and neutron
diffraction3 and Form II by Xray diffraction.2,4 An Xray diffraction study of Form I at 30 K
has also been reported.5 In all these studies lcysteine is found as a zwitterion (see Figure 1).
