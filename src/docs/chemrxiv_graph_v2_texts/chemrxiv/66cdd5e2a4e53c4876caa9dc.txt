Description:
Tends to form oxyanions that are highly soluble in water.

Geological disposal allows the reliable isolation of ra
dioactive waste, thereby protecting the natural environ
ment from the effects of residual radiation 1, 2, 3. Cur
rently, clays and hardened cement are considered the best
barrier materials due to their excellent sorption properties
4, 5. The transport properties of the 79Se isotope are
considered for the safety assessment of waste repositories
due to its long halflife. Selenium tends to form oxyanions that are highly soluble
in water. Four different oxidation states (II, 0, IV, VI)
of selenium are generally considered, and two of them (IV
and VI) are of particular interest in the aqueous phase. According to the experimental data, selenite Se(IV)O32
and selenate Se(VI)O42ions are also stable in the cement
matrix 6, 7, 8.
