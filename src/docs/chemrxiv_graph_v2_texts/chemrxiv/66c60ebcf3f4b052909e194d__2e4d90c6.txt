Description:
A commonly used precursor in selective deposition processes.

Text:
In case of the selective deposition of Al2O3, for 
example, 
a 
higher 
number 
of 
selective 
deposition 
steps 
was 
possible 
with 
dimethylaluminumisopropoxide (DMAI) compared to the most often used precursor 
trimethylaluminum (TMA).15 In the same way, triethylaluminum (TEA) outperformed TMA and 
a set of alkyl aluminumchlorides in terms of achieved selectivity.14,16 While selectivity in ASALD 
thus obviously depends on the choice of the precursor, the underlying reactivity is not yet fully 
revealed for many processes. Consequently, a better understanding of precursor chemistry is 
desirable to improve selectivity in current processes and to develop new ASALD processes. The precursor chemistry is defined by the precursor size, its chemical reactivity and physical 
properties like volatility and thermal stability.
