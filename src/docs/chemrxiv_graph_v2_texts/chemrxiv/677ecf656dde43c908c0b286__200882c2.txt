Description:
Unique among amino acids due to the large atomic radius of its sulfur atom and the relative weakness of the SH bond.

Cysteine is unique among the twenty proteogenic amino acids due to the large atomic radius
2
of its sulfur atom and the relative weakness of the corresponding SH bond. This imbues it
3
with remarkable nucleophilicity, facilitating spontaneous reactions even under mild conditions.1
4
The inherent nucleophilicity of a given cysteine is governed by its pKa, a value that implies the
5
favorability of the ionization state of the thiol.

Description:
Residues play functional roles in redox and nucleophilic catalysis, metal binding, environmental sensing, and structural formation.

Text:
Solventexposed cysteines have values near 8,2,3
6
while buried cysteines or those located in a unique protein microenvironment can range from 3
7
to 12.4,5 Given their variable pKa values and unique properties, cysteine residues play various
8
functional roles in redox and nucleophilic catalysis,6 metal binding,7 environmental sensing,8 and
9
structural formation.9,10
10
In recent years, interest has grown in targeting cysteine residues with covalent inhibitors.11
11
To overcome poor target selectivity and drug resistance, an electrophilic warhead moiety may be
12
incorporated into a reversible submicromolar inhibitor to covalently bind a nucleophilic residue this
13
modification can dramatically increase therapeutic potency.12,13 Members of this class of reactive
14
molecules are commonly referred to as targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) and predicting their
15
affinity and reversibility is particularly desirable.14
16
A key step in a TCI binding and reaction landscape is the deprotonation of the cysteine thiol
17
and the formation of the nucleophilic thiolate.

Description:
A side chain whose protonation rate and pKa are correlated, influencing its reactivity and propensity for covalent modification.

Text:
Experimental exchangerate studies have shown
18
that the equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated states of solventexposed cysteine
19
side chains is fast15 (i.e., 1012  M1s1) and that the protonation rate and pKa are well corre
20
lated.15,16 That is to say, the pKa of a particular cysteine provides the relevant information about
21
the energy required to form the nucleophilic thiolate and, by extension, the propensity for covalent
22
modification. 23
Experimental methods for determining the pKa value of a cysteine can involve kinetic assays,
24
spectrophotometric titrations, or NMR spectroscopy; however, in a purely computational in silico
25
screen of potential covalent modifiers, the ability to rapidly and accurately probe the reactivity of
26
a target cysteine under various conditions is highly desirable.
