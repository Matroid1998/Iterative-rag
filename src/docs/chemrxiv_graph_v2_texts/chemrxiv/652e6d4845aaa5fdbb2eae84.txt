of additional quinone 
redox active centers into the structure. The modification increased the voltage and capacity of 
the material. The OTQC delivers a high specific capacity of 327 mAhg1 with an average 
voltage of 2.63 V vs. LiLi in the Liion battery. That corresponds to an energy density of 860 
Whkg1 on the material level. Furthermore, the material demonstrated excellent cycling 
stability, having a capacity retention of 82  after 400 cycles. Similarly, the OTQC 
demonstrates increased average voltage and specific capacity in comparison with TQC in Zn
organic battery using aqueous electrolyte, reaching the specific capacity of 326 mAhg1 with 
an average voltage of 0.86 V vs. ZnZn2.
