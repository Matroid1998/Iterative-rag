Description:
A widely used plastic in the textile fiber and packing industries, known for its mechanical recycling challenges.

Plastics are good examples of the takemakewaste production model, with the vast ma
jority of its production coming from fossil petrochemical feedstocks and most of its disposal
relying on landfilling or incineration.1 These practices lead to severe, negative environmental
and economic impacts due to their accumulation and biodegradation recalcitrance.13 Due to
the nonrenewable origin of plastics, such a paradigm also raises questions about its scarcity
and potential impact on production chains worldwide in the near future.4
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most singleused plastics produced world
wide,5,6 with wide applicability in the textile fiber and packing industries.7 The most common
recycling process applied to PET is mechanical grinding followed by melting and reforming.8
Such processes lead to a downcycling each cycle produces a material with fewer mechanical
properties of interest, which eventually hampers further recycling.8
In recent years, plastic recycling research has gained new momentum with the iden
tification of a PET hydrolase isolated from I. sakaiensis capable of degrading PET close
to room temperature.9 Many other PET hydrolases have been characterized since then,
improving catalysis rates, enzyme thermostability, and reaction conditions.1015 Still, most
enzymatic protocols struggle with degrading highcrystallinity substrate or performing well
under lowpH conditions,5 which are the main challenges in reducing the cost of enzymatic
PET degradation.7
More recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided many structural
insights into the interactions between PET and many different esterases.13,1619 In addition,
other studies have modeled the interaction between carbohydratebinding modules and PET
