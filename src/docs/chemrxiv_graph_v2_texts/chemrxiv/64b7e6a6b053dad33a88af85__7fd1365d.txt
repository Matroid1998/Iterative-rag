Description:
Mainly produced by the thermal cracking of ethane or naphtha.

Text:
Ethylene (C2H4), an important chemical feedstock and 
industrial gas, has been widely used to produce polymers (e.g., 
plastics) and other valued products in modern life.14 
Currently, C2H4 is mainly produced by the thermal cracking of 
ethane (C2H6) or naphtha, with the inevitable presence of 
acetylene (C2H2) and C2H6 byproducts.

Description:
A compound purified using porous materials for its high efficiency and environmental friendliness.

Thus, separating C2H2 
and C2H6 from these mixtures is an industrial necessity to 
obtain polymergrade C2H4 (99.9 purity), but remains a 
significant challenge because of their very similar physical 
properties, including boiling points, quadrupole moment, and 
kinetic diameter.58 Recently, as an alternative separation 
technology, the utilization of porous materials as sorbents for 
C2H4 purification has attracted widespread interest due to their 
high efficiency and environmental friendliness.913 In this 
regard, porous crystalline adsorbents such as metalorganic 
frameworks (MOFs)1416 and hydrogenbonded organic 
frameworks (HOFs)1720 have been developed for C2gases 
mixture separation, significant progress has been devoted to 
addressing the efficient separation of C2H4 from binary 
C2H2C2H4 and C2H6C2H4 mixtures due to their welldefined 
structure, controllable pore size and modifiable pore 
environment.
