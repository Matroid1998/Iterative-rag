Description:
Subject to cleavage in biotransformation processes.

Text:
Once maleimide is hydrolyzed, the linker
payload is no longer subject to elimination through retro
Michael 
reaction 
and 
thus 
prevents 
nonspecific 
deconjugation.4,5 Another reported biotransformation is 
hydrolysis on the payload structure.6 Other observed changes to 
linkerpayload are cleavages or partial loss, such as hydrazone 
cleavage, peptide bond cleavage, carbamate cleavage, and 
disulfide cleavage, etc.3 In summary, the biotransformation of 
conjugated payload is very different from released payload or 
small molecules. Assessing biotransformation of conjugated payload is 
important for evaluating efficacy because the payload 
component may be still active depending on the change.7 
Overall, ADC biotransformation information is valuable for 
understanding in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics for 
guiding drug design. Traditional 
bioanalysis 
supporting 
pharmacokinetic 
assessments involves monitoring surrogate analytes (peptides 
or payload) via targeted bottomup based approach.
