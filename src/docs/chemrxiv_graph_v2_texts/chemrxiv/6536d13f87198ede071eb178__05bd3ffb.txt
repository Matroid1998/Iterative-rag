Description:
A type of activated alkyl halide involved in Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions.

Text:
Electrochemical reduction is an ideal platform for XEC because it avoids metal powder 
reductants, offers controllable reduction potential and reaction rate, and can be easily integrated 
with flow synthesis.18, 14, 16, 19, 12, 20 Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions between aryl 
halides and activated alkyl halides, such as chloroesters and chloroketones, were reported as 
early as the 1990s,2123 but never emerged as a general synthetic strategy.
