Description:
Complexes have been explored for their antimicrobial properties.

Text:
The crowdsourced organization, COADD (Community for Open 
Antimicrobial Drug Discovery)8 has tested over 300,000 molecules and shown that 27  of all metal 
compounds screened by them (1000) showed some antimicrobial activity, compared to the 2  of organic 
compounds.9 Furthermore, it is likely that antimicrobial metal complexes will act through mechanisms that 
are distinct to those of traditional antimicrobial agents which could delay the development of resistance. Palladium complexes have only been explored sparsely for their antimicrobial properties.10 Zalevskaya et al. described a series of terpenederived palladium complexes with antimicrobial properties in 2020.11 A recent 
analysis of the antifungal properties of the COADD metal complexes revealed that 51 palladium containing 
complexes were submitted for screening.

Description:
An element with compounds showing antifungal activity and low cytotoxicity in vitro assays.

Text:
Of these 31 (61) showed activity against the two fungal pathogens 
tested by COADD, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Together with silver, palladium was the 
element with the highest number of active compounds. In addition to antimicrobial activity, COADD also 
tests active compounds for their cytotoxicity against mammalian cells as well as their haemolytic properties. Of the 31 active compounds, 12 palladium complexes did not show any toxic properties in these in vitro 
assays. Figure 1 shows three of the structures (13) with the best antifungal activity in the COADD panel.12 
These compounds showed high levels of activity across a panel of fungal pathogens with different degrees of 
drug resistance. However, upon further investigation, relatively high levels of cytotoxicity and haemolysis 
were found for compounds 13.
