Description:
A resource used in Li-ion batteries, with concerns about scarcity and environmental impact during mining and disposal.

Text:
While Liion batteries offer high performance in terms of energy density, operating voltage, 
and cycle life 1, 2, they cannot meet the growing demand for energy storage alone, primarily 
due to the relative scarcity of lithium resources 3. Additionally, concerns exist regarding their 
physicochemical performance 4, safety 5, sustainability of the materials used 6, and 
environmental impact both during lithium mining 3, 7 and after battery disposal 8. Therefore, it 
is essential to explore alternative energy storage systems to address these limitations and
