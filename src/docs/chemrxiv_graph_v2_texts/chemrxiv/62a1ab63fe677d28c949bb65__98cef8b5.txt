Biomass, the most abundant renewable resource on the planet, has found applications in producing 
sustainable fuel sources and chemicals.1, 2 Vanillin is widely regarded as one type of platform 
intermediate for the conversion of lignin biomass into valuable chemicals and fuels due to the 
presence of OH, CHO and benzene ring functional groups. In particular, the selective 
hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin to 2methoxy4methylphenol (MMP) is highly desired as MMP is 
an essential chemical applied in fragrances and the synthesis of the pharmaceutical intermediates.36 
To achieve efficient conversion of vanillin to MMP, considerable catalyst systems have been
