Description:
Absorbs radiation in the form of black carbon, affecting global climate.

Text:
The formation of atmospheric molecular clusters is believed to be the initial step in atmo
spheric aerosol New Particle Formation (NPF).1 Aerosol particles directly aect our global
climate via aerosolradiation interactions. This can either be scattering of sunlight by inor
ganic particles or absorption of radiation by black carbon.2 Aerosol particles also indirectly
aect the global climate via aerosolcloud interactions.3 For instance, aerosol particles around
50 nm or larger can act as nuclei for cloud droplet formation.
