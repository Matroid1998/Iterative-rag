Description:
Consumed in fully electrochemical processes for ammonia generation, operating at near-ambient conditions.

Text:
Owing to its high volumetric energy density and facile liquefaction at moderate 
temperature and pressure conditions,1 renewablygenerated ammonia is a compelling lowcarbon 
fuel for the heavy transportation sector.2 
Fully electrochemical processes for ammonia generation, consuming only nitrogen, water, 
and renewable electricity, have received a great deal of recent interest in academic research, as 
they can operate at nearambient conditions and respond dynamically to power supply 
intermittencies.3,4 Despite labscale reports of fully electrochemical ammonia generation processes 
of all stripes, including high temperature electrochemical processes,57 ambientcondition 
processes using aqueous8,9 and nonaqueous electrolytes,1013 batch semielectrochemical 
processes,14,15 as well as plasmabased processes,16,17 these approaches are nearly universally 
assessed to lack the efficiency and robustness required to produce ammonia economically at scale 
in their present form.

Description:
Reacts with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure to synthesize ammonia in the Haber-Bosch process.

Text:
Processes which utilize watersplitting derived hydrogen and traditional HaberBosch 
reactors report ammonia costs of 0.81.2 kg NH3,1821 though there are reports of ammonia costs 
in the 0.40.6 kg NH3 as well.22 However, there are several drawbacks to these processes that 
could make a fully electrical ammonia production approach attractive. HaberBosch ammonia is synthesized by reacting nitrogen and hydrogen at high 
temperature and pressure in large, centralized plants.4 Typically, the hydrogen is derived from 
fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, most commonly via the steam reforming process.
