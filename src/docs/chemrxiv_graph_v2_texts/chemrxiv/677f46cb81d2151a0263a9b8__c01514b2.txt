Description:
Catalysts used in the oxidative coupling of methane.

Text:
A variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been explored as catalytic 
materials for direct methane conversion, including oxidative coupling of methane over metal 
oxides,17, 18 nonoxidative methane dehydroaromatization using zeolitesupported metal 
catalysts,19, 20 and direct conversion through CC coupling on metallic surfaces.21 Unfortunately, 
no practical catalysts exist today for direct methane conversion due to high CH bond activation 
barriers andor rapid catalyst deactivation by coke contamination.2224 
Recently, Marcinkowski et al.25 and Hannagan et al.26 experimentally demonstrated that 
single atom alloys (SAAs), atomically dispersing a minimum amount of reactive metal atoms in
