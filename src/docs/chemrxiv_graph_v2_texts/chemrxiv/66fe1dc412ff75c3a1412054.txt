Description:
An anticancer drug with the skeletal structure C47H51NO14.

Text:
With the establishment of a chromosomelevel highquality
reference genome map of Taxus in 2021, the biosynthesis of
anticancer drug Paclitaxel shown in Figure 1 has become a
more active area of research due to the potential to increase
drug compound yield using economical and convenient cul
tures. Therefore, 10 2024 abstracts were summarized by the
manuscripts author in the following paragraphs for comparison
purposes to AI regarding the taxane drugs biosynthesis. Figure 1 Paclitaxel Skeletal Structure, C47H51NO14
Li, C., et al. in May 2024 functionally characterized a novel
cytochrome P450 enzyme called Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1)
that efficiently catalyses the formation of the oxetane ring in
paclitaxel.

Description:
One of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents against a range of malignant tumours.

Text:
Using 2H and 18O labelling and density functional
theory calculations, a possible reaction mechanism was pro
posed involving intramolecular oxidationacetoxyl rearrangement
through a concerted process published in 1. As one of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents
against a range of malignant tumours, the increasing de
mand for paclitaxel has led to the development of multiple
strategies to address supply issues instead of extracting
this compound from the bark of slowgrowing yews due
to its low content in Taxus plants. Li, C., et al. 2024 1. Escrich, A., et al. in August 2024 combined in silico meth
ods and functional gene analysis to help characterize the taxane
hydroxylase, which is needed to oxygenate paclitaxel interme
diates.
