Description:
A product formed in reactions involving glucose, with yields compared to hydroxymethylfurfural.

For example, many have focused on
8
identifying the dominant pathways for forming hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from glucose using
9
a series of elimination and isomerization reactions.1821 However, the activation energies of the
10
proposed pathways to HMF formation are still relatively high (60 kcalmol),15,2022 and do not
11
provide convincing explanations for higher yields of HMF compared to other products, such as
12
hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA). 13
Automated reaction prediction methods have recently made great advances in terms of cost,
14
accuracy, and throughput that enable them to often find lowbarrier reaction mechanisms with
15
minimal or no mechanistic guidance.2332 However, many of these algorithms scale extremely poorly
16
with reactant size, limiting their application to very small systems. Even algorithms that can be
