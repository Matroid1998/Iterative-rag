Description:
A component of N-alkoxy alkyl-N-chloroacetyl substituted derivatives used in chloroacetanilide herbicides.

Nucleic acid 
reactivities vary far less than protein reactivities, and the mutagenic potential of nucleic 
acid adducts can be readily determined through wellestablished mutagenicity assays 
such as the Ames test. Assays that identify the protein targets of electrophiles and other 
reactive exposure agents are necessary to identify their molecular mechanisms of 
toxicity. One of the most popular herbicide classes over the past 50 years is the 
chloroacetanilides, which feature a highly electrophilic haloacetamide motif. These 
herbicides are Nalkoxy alkylNchloroacetyl substituted derivatives of aniline and 
commonly used to minimize weed control for agricultural goods such as corn, maize, 
and rice7. Despite increased regulation due to evidence for carcinogenicity8,9 and 
potential to accumulate in soil and wetlands10, chloroacetanilides remain widely used 
throughout the world11.
