Description:
A widely used photoanode material in PEC water splitting.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology to generate and store 
green energy as it directly converts solar energy into chemical energy by splitting water into 
hydrogen and oxygen. The PEC water splitting process consists of two halfreactions the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER), occurring through a fourelectron process in the photoanode, and the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), occurring through a twoelectron process in the photocathode 
2. The OER is the key limiting step in the PEC water splitting since it is mechanistically more 
complex and associated with higher overpotentials than the HER. Therefore, a lot of scientific 
effort has been devoted to developing more efficient photoanode materials 35. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a widely used photoanode material in PEC water splitting, 
recognized for its exceptional properties.
