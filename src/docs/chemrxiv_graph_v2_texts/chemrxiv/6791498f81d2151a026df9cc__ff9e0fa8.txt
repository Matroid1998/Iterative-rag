Description:
Contains a thiol group directly functionalized to the substrate.

Text:
Boron contributes sulfurresistivity for poisonresistant catalysis allowing 
it to avoid sulfur poisoning, even at elevated sulfur concentrations and enable a longer catalyst 
lifetime.57 What made Al0.2Nb0.2Pt0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2B2 remarkable was its ability to catalytically reduce 
4nitrothiophenol which contains a thiol group directly functionalized to the substrate. This would 
have been the worst possible test case for poisonresistant catalysts as the substrate itself is 
poisonous at 1,000 ppm loadings, far exceeding the sulfur tolerance of previous poisonresistant 
catalysts. This remarkable tolerance must be derived from the borophene sheets most important 
function; in that it shields platinum from sulfur, while maintaining its high catalytic activity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025018jg ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000256776970 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
