Description:
An aqueous electrolyte used in conjunction with NiO based photocathodes.

30 So far, it is 
unknown whether, and if so how, the external bias potential affects the charge separation and 
recombination dynamics in an aqueous electrolyte. In this work, we investigate the effect of external bias potential on the photodynamics of a NiO
based photocathode in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) by timeresolved photoluminescence
