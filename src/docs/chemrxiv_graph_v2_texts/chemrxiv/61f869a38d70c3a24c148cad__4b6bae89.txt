Description:
Cation is the most abundant in the Earth's crust.

In the current glass market, there is a great need for inorganic materials that are mechanically strong with respect to 
mechanical wearing, can withstand high temperature processing, and possess enhanced wettability with large water 
contact angles. Such materials are interesting for applications in photovoltaic panels installed in rainy or high humidity 
areas, windows of buildings, automobiles, etc. RareEarth metal oxides (REOs) possess hydrophobic properties 1. Cerium dioxide (ceria), which cation is the most 
abundant lanthanide in the Earths crust 2, exhibits a large bandgap between 3.03.6 eV 35 which makes this 
material promising for the abovementioned applications. The original explanation of the ceria wetting behavior was 
based on its electronic structure 1.
