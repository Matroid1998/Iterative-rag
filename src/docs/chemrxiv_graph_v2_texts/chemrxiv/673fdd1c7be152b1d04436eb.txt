Description:
A metal cation that interacts with triazolide clusters through charge-dipole interactions.

of electron lone 
pair density and dipole moments. Here we investigate sodiated and potassiated clusters of 1,2,3
triazolide, 
Mx(123T)x1 
(x  3, 4; M  Na, K), 
and 
1,2,4triazolide, 
Mx(124T)x1 
(x  3, 4; M  Na, K), using a combination of infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) and DFT 
calculations. Cluster structures are strongly influenced by chargedipole interactions and CT from 
N lone pairs to the metal cations. IRIS spectra indicated that the geometries of the triazolide 
moieties are essentially unperturbed by interaction with the metal ions. Additional spectral 
features, not predicted by DFT calculations, that are observed in the 1500  1800 cm1 region seem 
to be associated with combination bands involving CH wagging and ring torsion motions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20240qjmn ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000066559307 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
