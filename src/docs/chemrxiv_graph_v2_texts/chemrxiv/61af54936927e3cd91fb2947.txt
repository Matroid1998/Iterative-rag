Text:
Phosgene and its 
substitutes are important industrial feedstocks used in the productions of polyurethanes, polycarbonates, 
pharmaceuticals, insecticides, and aniline dyes.1718 On the other hand, phosgene, and diphosgene are highly toxic 
lung irritation effects even at low conversions, for which have been used as chemical warfare agents (CWAs) during 
World War I and World War II.19 As a substitute for phosgene, triphosgene is nonvolatile, and widely used in 
chemical synthesis.
