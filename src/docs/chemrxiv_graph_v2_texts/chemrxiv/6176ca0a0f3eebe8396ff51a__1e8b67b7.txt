Description:
Catalytically active sites modified through heteroelement incorporation.

Text:
The recent 
decade of work in the field has yielded important gains in understanding the roles of incorporating Fe 
impurities, lattice strain, substrate effects, interfaces and exfoliation.711 In an orthogonal direction, the 
modification of the catalytically active sites through heteroelement incorporation has yielded 
substantial gains in performance over purely NiCoFe oxides, though most efforts focus on cationic 
incorporation12. In contrast, anionic incorporation is seldom used, largely due to synthetic challenges, 
especially in the direction of fluoride substitution. However, initial reports suggest that heteroanionic 
compounds hold much promise as OER catalysts, though the factors driving these observations are not 
fully settled1319. Often, metal oxides catalyze the OER through sequential protoncoupled electron 
transfer steps.
