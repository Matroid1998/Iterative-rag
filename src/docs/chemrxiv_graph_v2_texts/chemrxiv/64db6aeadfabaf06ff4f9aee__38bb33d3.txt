Description:
A high-pressure phase linked to time-pressure-temperature synthesis protocols.

Text:
Extreme pressuretemperature conditions are a powerful tool for creating nanostructured materials.17 
Such materials are not only interesting for the fundamental understanding of microscopic phenomena 
due to nanostructuring (mechanical and transport properties, etc. ), but also have great potential for 
advanced applications as wide bandgap semiconductors. In traditional experimental approaches, the 
recovery of highpressure phases (diamond, stishovite, rsZnO, etc.) is linked to the timepressure
temperature (tpT) synthesis protocol (e.g. rate of decompressioncooling from pT synthesis 
conditions, decompression temperature, etc.) and the initial state of the precursors (e.g. grain size, 
impurities). For example, nanocrystalline stishovite (highpressure polymorph of SiO2) and rsZnO can 
be quenched down to ambient conditions starting from periodic mesoporous silica3 and nanopowders 
of wurtzite ZnO,4 respectively.

Description:
A nanocrystalline form that can be easily recovered at ambient conditions.

Text:
This problem has been solved in 
the case of nanocrystalline diamond,5 boron nitride,6 and stishovite,7 i.e., in the cases where the phases 
can be easily recovered at ambient conditions, one only need to optimize the tpT conditions of direct 
solidstate phase transformations in order to ensure nanostructuring of a highpressure phase. However, 
in the case of zinc oxide, this approach has not worked so far, and synthesis of pure rsZnO remains a 
major challenge, as does understanding of the properties of rsZnObased materials (nanocomposites, 
solid solutions with transition metals, etc.
