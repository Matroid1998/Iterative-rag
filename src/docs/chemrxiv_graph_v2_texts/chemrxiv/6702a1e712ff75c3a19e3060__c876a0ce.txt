Description:
Shows improved resistance to ACQ with modest PL decrease as doping concentration increases.

DCzBN shows improved 
resistance to ACQ as the PL decreased modestly from 98 to 90 as the doping concentration 
increased from 1 to 30 wt in 3,3bis(Ncarbazolyl)1,1biphenyl (mCBP) compared to that 
of SCzBN (95 to 84) and the naked MRTADF core, DtBuCzB, (92 to 48). The EQEmax 
of the OLEDs with DCzBN exhibited less sensitivity to the doping concentration of the 
emitter, decreasing from 28.7 to 24.8 in comparison the devices with SCzBN and DtBuCzB 
where the EQEmax decreased from 22.1 to 16.1 and 21.0 to 9.9, respectively, as the doping 
concentration increased from 5 to 20 wt. However, all devices (5 wt emitter doping) 
showed significant efficiency rolloff, with EQE1000 of 12.4, 11.4, and 11.7, respectively.
