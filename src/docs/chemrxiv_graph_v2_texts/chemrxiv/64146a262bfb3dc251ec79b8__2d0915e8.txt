Description:
A material where light absorption and charge separation occur in the same material.

Text:
This working principle differs from conventional photoelectrodes, based on e.g. Fe2O3 or Cu2O, where light absorption and charge separation take place in the same material12
13 In this case, the external potential (positive bias for ntype and negative bias for ptype 
semiconductors) facilitates lightinduced charge separation and retards charge recombination 
in the semiconductor by introducing more band bending,14 leading to a higher photocurrent at 
more positive (photoanode) 15 or more negative potential (photocathode) 16. However, whether 
an applied potential has the same effect on DSPEC cells with their configuration based on light
induced charge separation at the dyesemiconductor interface rather than inside the 
semiconductor is unknown, although some dyesensitized photocathodes show surprisingly low 
photocurrents at more negative bias potentials.
