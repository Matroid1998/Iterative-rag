Description:
Auxiliary ligands that influence the performance of transition metal catalysts.

Text:
Homogeneous transition metal catalysis, including hydroformylation,1 olefin metathesis,2 and 
crosscoupling reactions,3 has been established as one of the most important reactions in synthetic 
chemistry. Recently, the development of catalysts with high efficiency and selectivity for a desired 
chemical transformation, or unprecedented chemical bond recombination ability, has been a central 
research topic in organic chemistry. Generally, the performance of a transition metal catalyst is largely 
influenced by auxiliary ligands, such as organophosphorus compounds and Nheterocyclic carbenes 
(NHCs).4 Therefore, identifying the optimal ligand for a particular reaction, a process known as ligand 
screening, is crucial for the development of superior catalysts. Conventionally, ligand screening is 
performed through an empirical trialanderror approach (Figure 1a, left), which can be time 
consuming and resource intensive.
