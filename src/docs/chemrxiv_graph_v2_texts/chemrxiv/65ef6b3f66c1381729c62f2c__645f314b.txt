Description:
Alhydride complexes are used as precursors to provide reducing conditions.

Text:
Whereas Al2O3 thin films and the respective 
processes for their fabrication are well investigated and 
established, processes for the deposition of AlN and especially 
Almetal thin films are less explored and usually require strongly 
reducing process conditions like NH3, N2H4, or H2 coreactants 
or plasmas,18,19 owing to the highly negative electrochemical 
potential (Al3  Al0  E0  1.66 V)20. A strategy, providing 
those reducing conditions directly from the precursor and thus 
avoiding rather harsh (plasma) or hazardous (NH3, N2H4) 
process conditions, is to employ Alhydride (or alane) 
complexes as precursor.
