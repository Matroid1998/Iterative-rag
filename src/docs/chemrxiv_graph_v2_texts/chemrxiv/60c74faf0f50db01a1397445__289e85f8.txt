Description:
Require a small concentration for high capacity and low self-discharge.

Text:
In situ Raman and ex situ ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectroscopy 
30 
confirm I2, I3 and I5 during positive polarization and their reduction into I during negative polarization. In 
31 
situ SAXSWAXS data show that a majority of these species is confined to the carbon nanopores. Combined 
32 
with stochastic modeling, in situ SAXS quantifies the amount of solid iodine deposit and visualizes its 
33 
structural evolution in the pores. Based on the derived reaction mechanism, we show that high capacity with 
34 
low selfdischarge requires a small concentration of mobile polyiodides and a large fraction of immobile iodine 
35 
deposits. 36
