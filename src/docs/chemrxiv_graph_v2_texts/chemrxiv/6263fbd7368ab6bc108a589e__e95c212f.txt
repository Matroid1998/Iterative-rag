Description:
A catalyst used in the hydrogenation of alkene.

Simple 
heating of this mixture in isopropanol led to the exclusive 
formation of the impurity that was isolated and identified as 
lactone 1b. At that point, we did not pay much attention to that 
observation. Several months later, however, we received a 
request from a pharmaceutical company on the synthesis of 
oxetanecarboxylic acid 2a (Scheme 2). This acid was known 
in the literature6e,10 and scientists often used it in amide 
coupling.6e,11 Synthesis of 2a was described in a patent,10a and 
we followed the procedure hydrogenation of alkene 2 
(obtained in one step from 3oxetanone) using palladium on 
charcoal in methanol smoothly gave the desired product 2a. However, an inspection of this product by 1H NMR after one 
week revealed the presence of ca. 7 of an impurity.
