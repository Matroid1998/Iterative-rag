but this success is mitigated in certain cases by over
stabilization of delocalized electron systems,26,28,35,36
which is a consequence of selfinteraction error (SIE).37
This issue is thought to impact polymorph predic
tion in wellknown examples such as the anticancer
drug axitnib,26
the organic semiconductor molecule
rubrene,38 the wellstudied ROY molecule,26,28,35,39,40
molecule X26,41 from the third blind test of crystal
structure prediction,42 as well as other systems.26,36,43
Structures for several of these molecules are shown in
Fig. 1. Each of these molecules exhibits conformational
polymorphism whereby changes in intramolecular con
formation access dierent intermolecular crystal packing
motifs. Notably, in each of these molecules the extent of
electron delocalization changes as a function of one or
more intramolecular torsional coordinates.
