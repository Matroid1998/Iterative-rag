Description:
Shows significantly broadened peaks indicative of strong spin-spin interactions resulting from spatially localized TEMPO molecules.

TEMPOpolyCAT shows significantly broadened peaks compared to TEMPOCL, indicative of strong spinspin interactions 
resulting from spatially localized TEMPO molecules. d, The oxidation of 3phenyl1propanol (1) to its corresponding aldehyde (2) using 
TEMPOpolyCAT. e, Comparison of the rate of oxidation of TEMPOCL free in solution (black) and TEMPOpolyCAT gel (red). f, 
Cycling of the oxidation using TEMPOpolyCAT. Conversions are calculated based on 1H NMR integration vs. an internal standard. g, 
Deswelling, storage, and swelling of the material does not diminish the catalytic activity.
