Description:
An oxygenate compared to isobutanol, which has higher volatility and hydroscopicity.

In June 2018, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ap
proved the large scale blending of bioderived isobutanol into
gasoline at concentrations up to 16.1,2 This newly approved
oxygenate has multiple advantages over ethanol, such as lower
volatility,3 lower hydroscopicity,4 and higher energy density,3
while providing similar knock resistance.5 Relative to larger
alcohol additives, isobutanol also shows longer ignition delay
times with lower CO and NOx emissions,6 indicating it could
help boost the octane numbers of fuel while lowering other
emissions. With this approval, isobutanol could become a
major component of transportation fuel in the United States. While extensive experimental testing was necessary prior to
the approval,4 detailed isobutanol combustion models are still
inaccurate at enginerelevant conditions, indicating a gap in
our understanding of isobutanol combustion.
