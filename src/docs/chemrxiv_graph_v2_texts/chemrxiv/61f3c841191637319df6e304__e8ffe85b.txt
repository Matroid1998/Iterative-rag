Description:
HheG displays regioselectivity in the ring-opening of its derivatives.

for the synthesis of enantioenriched oxazolidinones, tertiary alcohols, epihalohydrines 
or spiroepoxyoxindoles, using HHDHcatalysis have been reported in literature.36 
Using a database mining approach based on HHDHspecific sequence motifs,7 a large number of new 
halohydrin dehalogenases have been identified in public sequence databases in recent years1 and 
several new members have been characterized as well.8 While most HHDHs display similar substrate 
scopes, HheG from Ilumatobacter coccineus also accepts sterically more demanding cyclic epoxides as 
well as acyclic nonterminal epoxide substrates.9,10 Additionally, HheG displays regioselectivity in 
the ringopening of different styrene oxide derivates,11 whereas other HHDHs exclusively attack the 
carbon of the epoxide ring. Solving the crystal structure of HheG9 revealed a much broader active 
site for this enzyme compared to other HHDHs,1215 which explains the acceptance of bulkier 
substrates.
