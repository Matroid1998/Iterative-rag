Apart from a drastic cut in emissions by the (full) transition from fossil to renewable energies,
the disposal of CO2 from the earths atmosphere  socalled negative emissions or carbon
dioxide removal (CDR)  is likely to become a challenge, mankind has to face within the next
decades, that is associated with significant land conversion.1,2 In this context, realising these
negative emissions at scale is becoming an increasingly important research topic spanning
20
a variety of research fields.3,4 A large number of currently investigated CDRtechnologies
are based on biological pathways or on a direct injection of CO2 into underground reser
voirs.3,5 (Photo)electrochemical methods  often also referred to as artificial photosynthesis
 offer a different approach.
