Description:
An inexpensive terminal oxidant used in combination with transition metal catalysts.

Text:
The oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones is an essential transformation in 
organic chemistry. 1, 2 The generation of aldehydes is particularly challenging as they 
are readily overoxidized to carboxylic acids. Over the past decades a variety of

methods have been developed, utilizing toxic heavy metals such as pyridinium 
dichromate (PDC) 35 or manganese dioxide (Figure 1). 6, 7 Molecular oxygen 8 
and peroxides 9, 10 can also be used as inexpensive terminal oxidants in combination 
with transition metal catalysts. Metalfree methods employ chlorodimethylsulfoniums 
as reactive species and gained great popularity under the name Swern oxidation or 
the CoreyKim oxidation.
