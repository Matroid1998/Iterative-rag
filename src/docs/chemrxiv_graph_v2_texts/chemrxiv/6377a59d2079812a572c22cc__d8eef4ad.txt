Description:
Subject to debromination in the suggested pathway.

Text:
In this work, we studied the fate of selected bromo and bromochloroalkanes in the active 
site of two haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs), LinB and DhaA. The dehalogenation reaction 
that these two enzymes catalyze is of prime importance from the environmental perspective as 
it leads to less toxic compounds, products of the halogen substitutions (Scheme 1). The 
dehalogenation by these two HLDs comprises two consecutive steps. The first one is a SN2 
reaction where a carboxylate group of the enzyme acts as a nucleophile and attacks a halogen
bearing carbon atom, yielding a halide and a reactantenzyme intermediate. This ester 
intermediate is then subsequently hydrolyzed by a neighboring water molecule, restoring the 
enzyme and yielding the product alcohol.1

Description:
Participates in a reaction catalyzed by LinB dehalogenase.

Text:
showed that the carbonhalogen cleavage is the rls in the case of DhaA 
reaction with 1,2,3trichloropropane (instead of product release as observed previously for the 
DhaA  1,3dibromopropane complex).3 Moreover, studies conducted using LinB in the 
reaction with 1,2dibromoethane,4 8chloromethyl4,4difluoro3,5dimethyl4bora3a,4a
diazasindacene (BDP), and 4(bromomethyl)6,7dimethoxycoumarin (COU),5,6 further 
underlined that the enzymatic process catalyzed by the same dehalogenase can be limited by 
different steps depending on the degraded substrate. These results, combined with those from
