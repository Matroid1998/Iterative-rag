Description:
An important widegap (3.4 eV) semiconductor with applications in opto and power electronics.

Text:
Gallium Nitride (GaN) is an important widegap (3.4 eV) semiconductor with applications in 
opto and power electronics.1 It offers excellent chemical durability and a high breakdown field 
strength.2 The high optical transparency and chemical stability of GaN make it a suitable 
material for solar cells.3 All of these applications require the deposition of GaN thin layers or 
films. An emerging technique for thin GaN films is atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique 
based on sequential delivery of gaseous reactant molecules to the surface of a heated substrate 
where surface chemical reactions deposit, ideally, one atomic layer. The film growth selflimits 
after the chemical reactions have consumed all available surface sites.
