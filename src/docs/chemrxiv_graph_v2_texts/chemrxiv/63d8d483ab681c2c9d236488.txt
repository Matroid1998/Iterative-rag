Description:
Organic acids characterized by the presence of a carboxyl group.

Therefore, recent method developments 
22 
have focused on HRMS coupled with liquid and or gas chromatography, including multidimensional 
23 
separations.3135 Ultimately, developing new, more effective analytical strategies within both sample 
24 
preparation, analytical separations and data processing is essential to increase our understanding of 
25 
petroleum acids. 26 
Herein, we describe a new methodology for profiling carboxylic acids in crude oil using a halogenated 
27 
amine tag with subsequent LC separation and precursor ion search by Orbitrap HRMS. The acidic fraction 
28 
was first isolated by LLE using a basic aqueoussolvent solution. The carboxylic acids in the extractant were 
29 
then activated and derivatized with 1ethyl3dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and 4bromoN
30 
methylbenzylamine (4BNMA), respectively (Figure 1). The method is based on Marquis et al.
