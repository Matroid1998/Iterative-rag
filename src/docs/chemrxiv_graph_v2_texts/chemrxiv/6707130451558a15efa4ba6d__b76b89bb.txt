Description:
A component in the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with negative curvature.

The difficulty extends to the zeolite templating method, 
in which even a smallest mismatch between crystal lattice param
eters of the zeolite template and the Schwarzite, or presence of any 
residual hydrogen atoms inevitably leads to defects. 22,23 
Recent advances in the bottomup synthesis of large size Polycy
clic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) have created a foundation of 
synthetic methods which may apply to the construction of novel 
carbonbased compounds and materials with exciting new topolo
gies beyond plane nanographenes. 2426 However, bottomup syn
thetic strategies for complete Schwarzite molecular architecture 
have not been discussed in literature. Currently, the only strategy 
for creating PAH with a negative curvature is narrowed down to 
occasional inclusion of heptagons or octagons between benzene 
rings.

Description:
A compound that can be constructed using heptagons or octagons as building blocks to form rings.

2631 The opposite approach suggested in this work is to use 
heptagons or octagons as building blocks and join them to con
struct benzene rings inbetween. This study is intended to bring 
attention of synthetic organic chemists to the needs of the research
