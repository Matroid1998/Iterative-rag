Description:
A sulfur-containing heterocyclic compound used in organic chemistry.

In reference 9 by Freeman it is surprising to see 
even a Hammett  value was reported for the dissociation of 5X2furoic acids without 
knowing Hammett  values because evaluation of Hammett  values took place only in 1937 
1. In spite of numerous works on the application of Hammett and Taft equations in organic 
chemistry, their application to five membered ring systems did not find much place in 
chemistry research 8, 11 except a onepage small publication appeared 50 years ago 9 and 
references cited there in. In this publication 9 the information of substituents in furan and 
thiophene derivatives used did not find a place. In the present work we tried a deep insight 
with a total of 12 heterocyclic systems.
