Description:
Catalysts used for manganese-catalyzed oxidative benzylic CH fluorination with better yields.

Text:
Manganesecatalyzed oxidative benzylic CH fluorination was 
shown to be accomplished with better yields using Mnsalen 
catalysts2. Mnporphyrin complexes were found to catalyze 
selective aliphatic CH bond halogenations with remarkable 
yields for a certain range of organic substrates1, 76. However, our 
attempts to fluorinate druglike molecules (e.g., containing 
heterocycles with N or O atoms) under the same experimental 
conditions were excluded. The reasons for this inapplicability of 
the published procedures of synthesis to druglike molecules, as 
far as we know, are unclear. Manganese exists in different oxidation states in the intermediates 
formed during a catalytic cycle12, 76, 7881. The presence of unpaired 
d electrons indicates a possibility of multiple spin states for each 
intermediate.
