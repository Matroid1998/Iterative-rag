Description:
Fatty acids used in the dimerization process to obtain dilinoleic diol.

Text:
However, plant oils, as well as fatty acid derivatives, 
have proved to be also a useful basis for developing biobased monomers (13). In our previous 
study, we demonstrated that dilinoleic diol (DLD) possessing a long aliphatic chain (C36) is a 
promising starting compound of novel polymeric materials (1420). Besides being an almost 
readily available, natural fatty acid derivative obtained via linoleic and oleic acid dimerization 
(21), it can be used as a comonomer to produce polymeric materials with improved flexibility 
(22). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20230qrs7v4 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000224743517 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
