Description:
Used in a reaction where the diazo peak in FTIR is absent in the product.

Text:
To test this, we treated various substrates 

Frist when thiophosgene was treated with 1a disubstituted diazo14, we obtained dichloro 
alkene 2a as major product along with impurities, and its beta lactam amide bond cleaved 
product 3a as minor product. The 3a is obtained due the C5N bond formation followed 
by amide bond cleavage. The aldehyde peak in NMR Is consistent with predicted values. in FTIR shows Isothiocyanate peak at 2060 cm1, which can be formed by SCN 
enolization15 The mass ms shows 447.2 peaks. (scheme2) 

On repeating the reaction with pyridine diazo 1b, we isolated a product 2b it contains, the 
C13NMR values consistent with product and the characteristics diazo peak in FTIR 
shows at 2240 cm1 is absent in product 3a.
