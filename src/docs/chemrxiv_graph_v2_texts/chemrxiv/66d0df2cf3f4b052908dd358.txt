Description:
Studied in alkaline systems on Pt(111) surfaces.

Here, the greatest concern is that the proton donors and acceptors activities, from a certain value, have no effect on the reaction 
24 
rate, resulting in a zeroth reaction order rather than half as the BV model predicts 23. This author proposes from his work on 
25 
polycrystalline platinum that it is ubiquitous in acidic, alkaline 3, and in the presence of other pH buffer systems. Instead, Lou et. 26 
al. argues that this phenomenon is only present in alkaline systems from their work on Pt(111) 2. 27

Here, I would like to offer an approach to describe electrochemical kinetics from statistical mechanics.
