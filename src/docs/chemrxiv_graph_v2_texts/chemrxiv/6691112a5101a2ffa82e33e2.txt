Description:
A phospholipid primarily present in high-density lipoprotein particles.

Text:
Egg yolk represents a complex system of functional ingredients that can be separated into 
plasma (78) and granules (22 of dry yolk matter)7. The plasma comprises 85 lowdensity 
lipoprotein (LDL) particles and 15 livetin. The granules consist of 70 highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) 
particles, 12 LDL, 16 phosvitin, and 2 ash8. Both LDL and HDL particles contain apoproteins and 
phospholipids, with the latter being primarily present as phosphatidylcholine (PC). Together with 
apoproteins and the phospholipids, phosvitin adsorbs at the oilwater interface, where it has been 
associated with prooxidant activity9. Phosvitin is a highly phosphorylated protein consisting of 
phosphoserine clusters capable of binding ferric ions. When released, these ferric ions can engage in 
redox cycling and thus catalyze lipid oxidation, which induces a loss of sensory and nutritional 
quality10.
