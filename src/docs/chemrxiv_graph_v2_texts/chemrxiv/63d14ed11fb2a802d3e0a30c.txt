Description:
Reacts with a Michael acceptor to release proline.

A distinct 
feature of natural shunts is that they offer control over product speciation in response to external 
stimuli or the organisms internal needs.710 Although the field of Systems Chemistry has 
developed numerous artificial reaction networks of various complexity,1120 shunts are 
exceedingly rare in synthetic reaction cycles. Here we show how two alternative pathways in an artificial reaction cycle (i.e., shunts) can be 
accessed depending on the oxidant strength (Figure 1). The reaction cycle starts from a Michael 
acceptor (MA) that reacts with a thiol to release proline. The thiol adduct is subsequently oxidized 
to the sulfoxide and further to the sulfone, allowing the proline to reattack and recover the original 
MA species. Strong oxidants provide access to all oxidation states of the sulfur species, i.e., sulfide,
