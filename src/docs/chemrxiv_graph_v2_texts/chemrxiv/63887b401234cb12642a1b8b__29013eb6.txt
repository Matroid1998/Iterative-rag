Description:
Based catalysts for PEMFC cathodes with performance nearly equal to PtC in fuel cells.

Text:
Fe single atoms in nitrogendoped carbon supports (FeNC) have emerged during the last decades as a promising 
cheap and accessible alternative electrocatalyst to precious group metals (PGMs) in the cathode of low 
temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Since Jasinski identified Fe macrocycles as 
promising PGMfree catalysts,1 plenty of research has been devoted to improve the activity and stability of iron 
based catalysts for PEMFC cathodes, whose performance nearly equals that of PtC in fuel cells.26 One of the 
most common approaches to improve the catalytic performance of FeNC materials is to enhance their intrinsic 
catalytic activity by modulation of the local coordination environment, for example by creating dual metal atom 
catalysts7,8 or introducing axial ligands.
