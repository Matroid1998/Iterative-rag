Description:
A conventional material used in solar photovoltaic cells.

In recent years, the production of renewable energy, particularly using solar photovoltaic 
(PV) technology, has increased significantly.1,2 Advances in alternative devices and materials to 
conventional silicon cells, such as perovskite,3,4 thin film,5 and organic PV,6 have been 
accompanied by growing interest in adjunct technologies that are able to enhance the 
performance of PV cells, or even just enable their use in nonstandard situations. In the built 
environment, widespread integration of standard PV panels is challenging, as their bulk and 
superior performance under direct light limits their installation to rooftops.
