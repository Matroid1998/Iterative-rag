Arsenic (As) is a toxic and highly mobile contaminant, which forms dangerous water
35 
soluble compounds for human health1,2. Anthropogenic sources and aquatic organisms 
36 
allow the methylation of inorganic arsenicals to monomethylated (MMA), dimethylated 
37 
(DMA), and trimethylated (TMA) arsenic species3, which usually have a lesser extent than 
38 
inorganic ones; however, increasing herbicides and pesticides worldwide makes them a 
39 
dangerous water and groundwater pollutant (Scheme 1a for molecular structures). Moreover, 
40 
trivalent and pentavalent methylarsenicals promote diabetes via distortion of glucose 
41 
metabolism46. Due to the latter, the World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted 
42 
regulatory standards to limit the arsenic concentration in drinking water, imposing a limit 
43 
value of 10 gL2.
