Description:
A mixed anhydride utilized in extant biological mechanisms.

Text:
Furthermore, an adequate hypothesis for how either of these mechanisms 
could have transitioned to the extant mechanism is yet to be proposed, calling into 
question their relevance to the origin and early evolution of life. We have previously reported an aminoacyltransfer reaction within a stemoverhang 
RNA structure (Fig. 1a).14 Starting from a chemically synthesised aminoacylphosphate 
mixed anhydride at the 5terminus of an RNA strand, in combination with a longer 
overhanging complementary RNA, the aminoacylresidue is spontaneously transferred 
to the 3terminus forming a 23aminoacylester. This mechanism has clear parallels 
to that of extant biology which utilises an aminoacyladenylate mixed anhydride and
