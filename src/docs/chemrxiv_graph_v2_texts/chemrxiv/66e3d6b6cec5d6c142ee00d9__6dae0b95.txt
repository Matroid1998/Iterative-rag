Description:
An underexplored structural motif for developing new chiral catalysts.

Text:
However, difficulties in preparation 
the biferrocenebased deveriatives cleanly (seperation from the reactants) and in high yield 
has held back the development of these type of ligands. Optical active biferrocenes still 
remain as an underexplored structural motif for developing new chiral catalysts. In 2012, Weissensteiner reported a synthesized route to build an unsymmetrically 2,2
disubstituted biferrocenes by Negishi coupling reaction.10 Two nonidentical ferrocene 
fragments was coupled and finally furnished a 2,2substituted biferrocenesdiphosphine, 
which could form eightmembered chelate ring by complexation to a metal. However, this 
synthesis methodology required optical pure precursors and total seven steps were needed 
which gave a low total yield (only 6.4).

Description:
Compounds that can be unsymmetrically 2,2-disubstituted through a diastereoselective route using Negishi-type coupling reactions.

Text:
Herein a diastereoselective route which can furnish 
two sets of unsymmetrically 2,2disubstituted biferrocenes derivatives with five steps was 
reported (depicted in Scheme 2 and Scheme 3). 2. Results and Discussion 
In order to synthesize the two sets of unsymmetrically 2,2disubstituted biferrocenes 
derivatives (Chart 1), Negishitype coupling reactions were found to be the most suitable and, 
depending on the type of starting material, a diastereoselective route was developed. A
