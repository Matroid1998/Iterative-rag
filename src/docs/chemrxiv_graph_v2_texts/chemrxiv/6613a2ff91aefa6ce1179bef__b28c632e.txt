Description:
Stores hydrogen efficiently at low pressures and moderate temperatures.

Solidstate hydrogen storage in metal alloys holds the potential to outper
form conventional (liquidcompressed) methods on accounts of volumetric ca
pacity, safety, and durability.1, 2, 3 One major advantage of hydrogen storage
in metal hydrides is their energyecient way of storing hydrogen at relatively
5
low pressures, and moderate temperatures eliminating the need for liquefac
tion or compression. The metalhydrogen bond oers the advantage of a high
volumetric hydrogen density under moderate pressures.4, 5 Despite signicant
performance improvements in metal hydrides over the past two decades, their
practical application is hindered by the unattainable thermodynamic and kinetic
10
properties at ambient conditions for economical viability.6, 7 The storage prop
erties of metal alloys are strongly related to the hydrogen pressure, temperature,
and the alloy compositions.
