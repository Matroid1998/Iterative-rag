However, POCs can 
pack together in the solidstate to form interconnected pore networks,6 and they have shown potential 
in the molecular separation of gases,7 hydrogen isotopes,8 and organic compounds.9 Additionally, POCs 
have been used as molecular sensors,10 and due to their discrete nature and solution processability, 
they have been incorporated into a new generation of porous materials known as porous liquids; that 
is, liquids that contain permanent intrinsic porosity.11 
The integration of stimuliresponsive moieties into porous materials such as MOFs and COFs can result 
in materials that are capable of a structural switch between two or more isomeric states.12 To induce 
a response, the energy input can be by photochemical irradiation,13 mechanical stress,14 or 
electrostatic stimulation.15 There are several benefits to incorporating stimuliresponsive functional 
groups in a porous material, including the ability to change the internal pore size allowing for onoff 
selectivity of gases, or to spontaneously release gas from within the porous material,16 or to block the 
pore windows enabling gas storage through a trapping technique.17 Several compounds undergo 
isomerization upon irradiation with UVvisible light (photoisomerization), including stilbenes,18 
azobenzenes,19 diarylethenes,20 spiropyrans,21 and imines.22 Here, azobenzenes were selected for their 
reversible EZ isomerization (Fig.
