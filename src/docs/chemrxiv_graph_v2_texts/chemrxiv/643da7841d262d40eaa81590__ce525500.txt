Description:
An achiral monomer used in catalytic mixtures to enhance enantioselectivity.

Text:
Along our interest in developing the catalytic 
properties of supramolecular BTA coassemblies,3641 we recently 
disclosed that the extent of the SSeffect was increased by two 
orders of magnitude, reaching homochirality with as low as 0.5 
of sergeants and close to the optimal enantioselectivity, at the 
surprizing condition that an achiral BTA monomer was added to 
the catalytic mixture.39 Improvement of the catalytic
