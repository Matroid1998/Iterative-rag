Description:
A gas that is highly soluble in monoethanolamine-based solvents.

Text:
In these technologies, aminebased solvents, particularly monoethanolamine (MEA), stand
out for their remarkable CO2 solubility, low viscosity, and satisfactory thermal stability 24. How
ever, MEAbased processes often require signicant energy for solvent recovery, and they are prone
to considerable solvent losses and potential equipment corrosion due to the presence of SO2 and O2
in the ue gases 50. Additionally, the synthesis of MEA from ammonia is, in itself, associated with
substantial CO2 emissions; this affects the overall lifecycle CO2 emissions of the capture process
26. Research also indicates that MEAbased processes have impacts on human toxicity and water
eutrophication 45.

Description:
Solubility in DESs can be tuned by changing the HBA and HBD components and their molar ratios.

Text:
In contrast to ILs, DES can be
synthesized from affordable and renewable raw materials under benign conditions and without the
necessity for elaborate purication processes. This also translates into considerably lower production
costs compared to ILs. Additionally, DESs offer desirable physicochemical properties, including low
melting points, low volatility, low vapor pressure, and high thermal stability 9. DESs are mixtures formed by a hydrogenbond acceptor (HBA), typically in the form of a poly
atomic cation with a Lewis base as an anion, and a hydrogenbond donor (HBD) that can be either
a Brnsted or Lewis acid 1. The properties of DESs (such as viscosity and CO2 solubility) can be
tuned by changing the HBA and HBD components and their molar ratios.
