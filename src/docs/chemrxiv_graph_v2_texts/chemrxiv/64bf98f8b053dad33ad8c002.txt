Description:
Undergo CH bond cleavage facilitated by transition metal complexes in solution.

Text:
Photochemical CH activation with transition metal 
complexes, involves the dissociation of one or several ligands from the photoexcited transition metal 
complex in a roomtemperature solution to generate a lowvalent reactive metal center that then 
facilitates CH bond cleavage in alkanes from solution. The most common metal complexes effectuating 
photoinitiated CH activation are second or third row transition metal carbonyls and dihydrides, where 
the loss of a carbonyl or dihydride ligand creates a reactive metal center. The open coordination site at 
the metal then enables the binding of an alkane to form a socalled alkane complex followed by 
subsequent CH bond cleavage in an oxidative addition step by insertion of the metal into the CH bond.
