Description:
A material whose performance in solar cells can be enhanced by coupling semiconducting and piezoelectric properties.

These 2D piezoelectrics can also nd in
teresting applications in new type of electronics such as
piezotronics1 where the electronic band gap is con
trolled by the electric potential steaming from piezoelec
tricity and in piezophotonics2, where light is coupled
with the piezoelectrically induced charges. For exam
ple, it has been predicted that the performance of MoS2
based solar cells can be enhanced by the coupling of semi
conducting and piezoelectric properties3. Quite often, reduction in materials dimension pro
motes unique properties. For example, bulk 2HMoS2 is
a nonpiezoelectric due to its centrosymmetry, whereas
the monolayer (also odd numbered layers e.g., trilayer)
has no inversion symmetry thus displaying piezoelectric
properties4.
