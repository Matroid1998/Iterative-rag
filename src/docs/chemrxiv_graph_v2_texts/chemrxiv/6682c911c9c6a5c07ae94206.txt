Description:
Released via a carbamate functionality in allylic position during TzTCO click reaction.

Text:
Bioorthogonal bondcleavage initiated by TzTCO click 
reaction was pioneered by Robillard et al., who demonstrated the 
release of amines linked to the TCO via a carbamate functionality 
in allylic position (Fig. 1b).5 This clicktorelease approach has 
been used to cleave ligandTCOdrug conjugates6 or activate 
TCOcaged prodrugs7 by in vivo reaction with systemically 
administered or locally restricted Tz, respectively. As these 
methods advanced toward clinical application,8 the scope of 
TzTCO bondcleavage has steadily expanded, enabling a 
growing number of applications in chemical biology and medicinal 
chemistry.9 Pretargeting the Tz, for instance, to organelles10 or 
solid tumors11 enabled targeted cleavage of TCOconjugates. The design of caged dihydrotetrazines as light or enzyme
responsive Tz precursors facilitates additional control of the click
torelease process.12 In contrast to turnon approaches such as
