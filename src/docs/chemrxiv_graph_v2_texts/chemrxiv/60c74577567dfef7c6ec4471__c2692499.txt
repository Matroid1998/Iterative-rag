Description:
A metastable supersaturated solid solution that decomposes into TiN and AlN-rich cubic domains above 900 C.

The addition of Al to TiN coatings drastically increases their resistance to
oxidation (from 500 C to 800 C), and also ensures the preservation of high values of hardness
and wear resistance at temperatures up to 900950 C.2224 Moreover, due to their variable optical
properties TiAlNbased coatings are very promising for photothermal and solar energy applications.25,26
However, the necessity to enhance the efciency of photothermal conversion of concentrating
solar collectors claims to increase operating temperature of solar absorbers. For example, in
concentrating solar power systems with gasphase central heat receivers operating temperature can
reach 1000 C.27 At the same time, annealing above 900 C results in spinodal decomposition of
the metastable supersaturated Ti1xAlxN solid solution into TiN and AlNrich cubic domains.
