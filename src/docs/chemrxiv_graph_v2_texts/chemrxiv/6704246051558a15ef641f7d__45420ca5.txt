Description:
Species whose binding energies correlate linearly with the binding energies of C atoms on various surfaces.

Text:
For instance, Pallassana and
Neurock (2000) demonstrated linear relationships between activa
tion energies and reaction energies, as well as between activation
energies and binding energies in CH bond breaking.5 Further work
by Nrskov et al. (2002) revealed a universal linear trend between
binding energies and activation energies for several types of disso
ciation reactions.6
A second class of linear relationships was proposed by Abild
Pedersen et al. (2007), who showed that the binding energies of
CHx, NHx, OHx, and SHx species on various closedpacked and
stepped surfaces correlate linearly with the corresponding binding
energies of C, N, O, and S atoms, respectively.7 A similar analy

Description:
Species that exhibit linear scaling relationships in binding energies on closed-packed surfaces.

Text:
(2011) demonstrated that several C2 species on
closepacked and stepped surfaces obey these linear trends well.8
Kolb et al. (2021) focused on closedpack surfaces only and also
observed linear scaling relationships between the binding energies
of C and CHx species.9 Such scaling relations have been rational
ized using a dband model7 through a separation of sp and d
electron contributions to the binding energy. Specically, the sp
electron contribution is expected to remain constant for a surface
made of different transition metals, while the delectron contribu
tion is deemed the major factor underneath the scaling relations. However, more detailed analysis is needed to further understand
the quantum chemical origins of these intriguing scaling relations
governing the binding energies.
