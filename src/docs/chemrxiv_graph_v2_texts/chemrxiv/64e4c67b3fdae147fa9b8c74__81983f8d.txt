Description:
A broadline radical used to polarize 1H spins in dynamic nuclear polarization.

The throughput 
of dDNP can be increased by using the broadline radical TEMPOL to polarize 1H spins and subsequently transfer 
the polarization from 1H to 13C spins before dissolution in the solid state, using crosspolarization (CP) in 
HartmanHahn conditions (HHCP)1618 or through the dipolar order (dCP).19,20 The CPbased approach is also 
capable of reaching high 13C polarization exceeding 60, but in a muchreduced time of typically 1520 min. However, the HHCP approach also has its Achilles heel as it requires strong radiofrequency (rf) powers that are 
difficult to realize in superfluidic helium, without detrimental arcing of the NMR coil.
