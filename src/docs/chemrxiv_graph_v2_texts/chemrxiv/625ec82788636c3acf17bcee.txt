Description:
Does not scale linearly with carbon in terms of chemisorption energies.

Text:
The model demonstrates that the root
cause of lack of scaling between two adsorbed species lies
in differences of their renormalised adsorbate valence en
ergies. For instance, Op states are considerably lower
in energy than Cp states. Through this analysis, we
identify the conditions under which carbon and oxygen
do scale with each other. II. CHEMISORPTION ENERGIES OF CARBON AND
OXYGEN DO NOT SCALE
In this section, we discuss the lack of linear scaling re
lations between the chemisorption energies of C and O. We use DFT calculations to obtain these chemisorption
energies (see Section VI for computational details).
