Description:
Organic anions present in biological molecules such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins.

Text:
The study of ion transport across artificial phospholipid membranes by synthetic transporters has 
become increasingly significant in recent years, as it allows for the emulation of biological membrane 
functions, including regulation of electrolyte levels and cellular communication.1,2 However, most 
studies have focused on the transport of inorganic anions, whereas the transmembrane transport of 
organic anions has been given less attention. This is surprising given that organic anions, particularly 
carboxylates, have essential roles in cells.3 Carboxylates (RCOO) are present in biological molecules 
such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins.4,5 Additionally, carboxylates are key molecules in cellular 
metabolism, biosynthesis, and the release of stored energy through the Krebs cycle. Furthermore, 
many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs),6 antibacterial,7 and fungicidal8 compounds have 
carboxylate groups in their structure.
