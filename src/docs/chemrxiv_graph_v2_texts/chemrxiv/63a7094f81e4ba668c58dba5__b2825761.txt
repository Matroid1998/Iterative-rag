Description:
A high-purity ceramic known for its good compressive properties and biocompatibility, making it suitable for dental and orthopaedic applications.

Text:
Alumina (Al2O3)based ceramics find extensive industrial applications owing to a number of 
desirable properties which mainly include low density, high compressive strength, wear 
resistance, and electrical and thermal insulation properties 1. A combination of good 
compressive properties of highpurity Al2O3 along with biocompatibility makes Al2O3 ceramic 
a potential candidate for dental and orthopaedic applications 2. On the other hand, laser 
additive manufacturing (AM) techniques (especially laser AM techniques) are based on a layer 
by layer deposition of materials, which leads to a largescale microstructural heterogeneity and 
formation of cracks (due to thermal stresses) in the deposited layers 35.
