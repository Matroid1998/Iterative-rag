Description:
An ABA type triblock copolymer with thermogelling properties used in the biomedical field.

Text:
Typically, reversible thermogelling properties of amphiphilic block copolymers are attributed to the 
use of a temperaturesensitive block, which enables temperaturedependent reversible formation of 
a micellar network.1 The nature of the micellar network is contingent upon the nanostructures formed 
by the underlying amphiphilic block copolymer, which in turn depends on the polymers composition 
and structure.2, 14, 15 Thus, micellar gel networks of BABtype block copolymers, where A and B signify 
hydrophilic and hydrophobictemperaturesensitive blocks, respectively, are generally achieved by 
bridging of flowerlike micelles.14, 1618 AB and ABA polymers, in contrast, typically undergo gelation 
due to the packing of regular spherical micelles, as is the case with Pluronics F127.14, 19, 20 This ABA type 
triblock copolymer is arguably the most widely used block copolymer with thermogelling properties 
in the biomedical field.2124 Being composed of hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) outer blocks and 
a thermosensitive polypropylene glycol (PPG) central block, it belongs to the class of Pluronic 
amphiphiles, also known as poloxamers.
