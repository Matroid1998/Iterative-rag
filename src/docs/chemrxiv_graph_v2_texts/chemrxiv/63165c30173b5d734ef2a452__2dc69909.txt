Description:
A transition metal layer in TMD sheets, adopting trigonal-prismatic or octahedral coordination.

Motivated by the novel properties and emerging appli
cation possibilities, twodimensional materials (2DM)
have been extensively investigated, with discoveries
surging in recent years16. Among them, transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) layers have gained par
ticular interest because of their unique properties, fa
cilitated by different elements and stacking polytypes. Each TMD sheet consists of a transitionmetal layer
(Mo, W, etc.) stacked between two chalcogen layers
(S, Se, or Te). Atoms within the sheet form strong
ioniccovalent bonds, with transition metals adopting
trigonalprismatic (2H) or octahedral (1T) coordina
tion. In contrast, the interactions between individual
threelayer sheets are limited to van der Waals (vdW)
attraction, which has allowed micromechanical exfolia
tion and intercalation of foreign species into the vdW
gaps of the TMD sheets.
