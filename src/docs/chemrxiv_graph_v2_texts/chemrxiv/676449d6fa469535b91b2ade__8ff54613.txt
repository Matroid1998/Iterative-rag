Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) derivatives have emerged as versatile alternatives for stabilizing 
AuNPs and planar surfaces.15 Compared with thiolbased counterparts, NHCs can offer higher stability 
and form stronger metalligand bonds.16 They can also be straightforward to synthesize and offer 
flexibility in modulating their steric and electronic properties through attachment of diverse functional 
groups.17 While NHCs had been shown to serve as ligands for AuNPs as early as 2009, these early 
examples did not explore stability or subsequent functionalization of the resulting surfaces.15f,g In 2013, 
our group reported the first examples of coating planar gold surfaces with chemically addressable NHCs 
that not only stabilize the surface but also possess functional groups suitable for further surface 
functionalization.15h Subsequently, Crudden and coworkers demonstrated the stability of NHCbased
