Description:
A metal oxide candidate as an adsorbent for enhancing the decomposition of CWAs.

Text:
For example, destructionbased methods (typically
23
pyrolysis) allow a onestep approach for the complete disposal of CWAs at the expense of
24
using specialized equipment under extreme conditions.1,2 On the other hand, neutralization
25
methods oer potentially reversible chemical treatments, leading to possible CWA precursors
26
under less severe conditions.1

Recent studies have shown that metal oxides can eectively destroy CWAs due to their
28
high surface area, a large number of highly reactive edges, corner defect sites, unusual lattice
29
planes, and high surfacetovolume ratios. In particular, metal oxides, such as CaO,3,4
30
MgO,5,6 ZnO,79 TiO2,1016 Al2O3,1720 Fe3O4,21 and CuO22 are candidates as adsorbents
31
for enhancing the decomposition of CWAs. In Al2O3, Al atoms in the bulk exhibit either a
32
tetrahedral or octahedral coordination.
