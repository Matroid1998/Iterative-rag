Description:
A gas used to fill the atmospheric pressure chamber in the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry process.

Text:
The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) process involves a solution of ions 
passing through a charged capillary. The solution emerges into an atmospheric pressure chamber 
filled with warm nitrogen gas, and creates a fine spray of droplets.1 These droplets carry an excess 
of one charge or another, dependent on the ion mode under study, and the excess charge is 
generated through electrochemical processes (oxidation in the positive ion mode, reduction in the 
negative ion mode).2,3 Electrochemistry is favoured in polar solvents,4 which is why ESIMS is 
nearly always conducted in such solvents, with wateracetonitrile and methanol being particularly 
popular.
