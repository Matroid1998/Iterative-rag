Description:
Used in micromotors that can propel in H2O2 solutions.

were the first to observe motion of 
commercially obtained MnO2 particles in the presence of H2O2, but the motion was rather 
slow and required a high concentration of the fuel.10 Later, few other groups reported MnO2 
based micromotors that could propel in relatively less concentrated H2O2 solutions.1416 Ye 
et al. introduced FeOxMnO2 and AgMnO2 based microtubular motors with ultrafast speeds 
and propulsion in very dilute H2O2 solutions.17,18 Wang et al. studied MnO2 micromotors 
for drug delivery,19 whereas Villa et al. used Fe2O3decorated MnO2 based microtubular 
motors for the removal of heavy metals and photocatalytic degradation of organic 
pollutants.20 He et al.
