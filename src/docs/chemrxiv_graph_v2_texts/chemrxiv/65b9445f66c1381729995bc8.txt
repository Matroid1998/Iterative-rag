Captured from dilute sources using amine scrubbing technology.

Text:
The conventional approach to capturing CO2 from dilute sources involves amine scrubbing technology, 
where CO2 is captured at 40C and released at 120C 3. However, these thermochemical techniques pose 
challenges due to their energyintensive nature, driven by operation at elevated temperatures. Additionally, 
they are susceptible to issues such as thermal degradation and corrosion of equipment, as well as the 
emission of volatile amines 4. In pursuit of more efficient alternatives, researchers have directed their
