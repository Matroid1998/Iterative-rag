Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and climate change.

Text:
The concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the 
Earths atmosphere are continuously increasing, being the main cause of global warming and 
climate change.1 In this sense, the use of renewable energies has become a recurring topic in order 
to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and, at the same time, to meet the increasing worldwide 
energy demands.2 However, such technologies are still far from coping with such needs, and other 
options need to be considered in the meantime. Within this context, one way of reducing the CO2 emissions is optimizing the energy efficiency 
of existing processes. For instance, removing CO2 from CH4 biogas fuel streams ensures an 
increase in the combustion power.
