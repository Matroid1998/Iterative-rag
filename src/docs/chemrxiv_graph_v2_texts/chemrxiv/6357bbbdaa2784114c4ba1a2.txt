Description:
A widely used benzodiazepine that metabolizes via hydroxylation and glucuronidation reactions.

To explore the potential of IRIS 
for the mapping of full metabolic pathways, we demonstrate here the identification of several 
metabolites resulting from the incubation of midazolam in human hepatocytes. Midazolam (MDZ) is a widely used benzodiazepine and is known to metabolize via hydroxylation 
and glucuronidation reactions.3336 Here, we detect several MDZ metabolites using LCMS and 
elucidate their full molecular structures in absence of reference standards, using a combination of 
MSMS fragmentation patterns and comparison of experimental IR spectra to DFT computed 
reference spectra. Glucuronated drug molecules readily expel the glucuronidegroup upon collisional
