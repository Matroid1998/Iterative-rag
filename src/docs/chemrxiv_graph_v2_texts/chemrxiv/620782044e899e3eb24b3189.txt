Description:
A substrate whose ortho CH bond can be activated by transition metal complexes.

Text:
For example, transition metal complexes bearing 
Lewisacidic ligands (based on B or Al) can activate the ortho CH bond of pyridine substrates (Figure 1).1013 C
H activation is believed to take place by an oxidative addition mechanism at the transition metal centre, 
leading to products in which the pyridyl group is directly bonded to this metal.1315 The main group ligand plays
