Description:
A building block used in palladium-based supramolecular cages.

Text:
For instance, the majority of metal sites in palladiumbased 
supramolecular cages are derivatives of the tetrakis(pyridine)palladium(II) building block.8 
Various methodologies have been used to model metalcontaining systems, including quantum 
mechanics (QM),912 molecular mechanics (MM) such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte 
Carlo (MC) simulations,12 and hybrid QMMM.11,12 These techniques have been applied to 
model metalloproteins,13,14 metalloorganic cages,15,16 and MOFs.1719 MM approaches, in 
particular, offer a significant advantage over QM methods in terms of computational costs.12 
MM based approaches for deriving forcefield parameters for metal ions, include the non
bonded,20,21,3032,2229 cationic dummy,3342 and covalent models (Figure 1b).4347 Nonbonded 
models describe metal centers as van der Waals spheres with integer charge, describing ligand
metal interactions through electrostatic Coulombic and LennardJones (LJ) terms.
