Description:
Versatile compounds used as mild oxidants in organic synthesis.

Text:
The chemistry of hypervalent iodine compounds, in particular aryl3iodanes, is 
versatile, and a wide range of applications is meanwhile established in organic 
synthesis.1 They can be applied as mild oxidants,2 in phenol dearomatizations3 or in 
oxygenation reactions.4 In a complemental reactivity, diaryliodonium salts are 
potent electrophilic aryl donors.56 Their cyclic, iodolium derivatives have a proven 
utility as precursors for the synthesis of hetero and carbocycles7, and their 
pronounced holes8 render them efficient halogenbond donors (XBdonors in XB
catalysis).9 Despite their great potential in organic synthesis and catalysis, their 
structural variation is still limited. In particular heteroarenebridged cyclic iodonium 
salts are rare.
