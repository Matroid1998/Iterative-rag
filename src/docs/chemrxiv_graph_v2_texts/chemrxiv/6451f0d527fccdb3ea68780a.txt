Description:
An early transition metal considered for use in next generation interconnects.

Text:
In this regard, the early transition metals Ruthenium57 (Ru) and Cobalt8
11 (Co) are of high interest as alternative materials for replacing Cu in next generation interconnects. While 
these metals are potentially facing supply issues, the amount of metal needed for interconnect at the 
transistor level, socalled level 1 and level 2 interconnect, will be very small, necessitating only limited 
quantities of both metals so that they are viable candidates for low level interconnect.
