have elucidated the intricacies of binding water molecules with 
formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) nanocrystal and demonstrated that its crystal facet 100 is 
substantially more vulnerable to moistureinduced degradation than facet 111.9 To improve the 
ambient stability of PNCs, doping of metal ions into perovskite crystal is in current focus of 
research.1012 
Metal iondoped perovskite nanocrystals (MPNCs) possess unique excellent photostability (PL), 
narrow spectral widths, and bandgap tunability. Very recently, doping of several alkalineearth 
metals (e.g., Mg2, Ca2, and Ba2) into perovskite nanocrystals have been investigated for 
improvement of photoluminescence quantum yield.1315 Transition metal ions have also been 
tested as dopants for achieving nearunity photoluminescence quantum yield, band tuning and 
improving stability.
