Description:
Contain angularly fused aromatic rings and express strong chiroptical responses due to their intrinsic helical chirality.

Text:
The classical helicenes contain angularly fused aromatic rings (Figure 1a) and 
express strong chiroptical responses due to their intrinsic helical chirality.1 A logical 
approach to enhance the chiroptical properties is an elongation of the helical structure. However, synthesis of long helicenes is very challenging as it requires the introduction of 
large strain and regioselective fusion of many rings.
