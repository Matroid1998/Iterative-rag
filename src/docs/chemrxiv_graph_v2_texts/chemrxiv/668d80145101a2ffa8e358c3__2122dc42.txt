Description:
Elements with inherent magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties.

Text:
Compounds containing lanthanide (Ln) elements have found multiple applications, due to 
their inherent magnetic, optical and catalytic properties.1 As Lnligand bonding is mainly ionic Ln 
ions tend to maximize coordination numbers to saturate their coordination spheres;13 these can be 
controlled with appropriate ligands to give complexes with favorable properties.49 Due to the hard 
Lewis acidic nature of Ln ions, the vast majority of Ln complexes contain ligands with hard Lewis 
basic light pblock donor atoms.1 For the group 15 elements this trend is epitomized by Ln amide 
chemistry being welldeveloped,1013 whilst Ln complexes bound by analogous ligands containing 
heavier softer pnictogens are comparatively rare.1416 
The bis(trimethylsilyl)amide ligand, N(SiMe3)2 (N), has been used extensively by fblock 
chemists since the trigonal pyramidal Ln(III) complexes LnN(SiMe3)23 were first reported over 
half a century ago.10,1719 Ln(II) N chemistry has flourished since EuN(SiMe3)22(sol)2 (sol  
DME or THF) provided the first structurally authenticated Eu(II) amide complexes in 1981;10,20 for 
example, a rare example of a Sc(II) complex, K(2.2.2cryptand)ScN(SiMe3)23, was reported 
in 2017.21 By contrast, the chemistry of the heavy pnictogen analog bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphide, 
P(SiMe3)2 (P), is immature.
