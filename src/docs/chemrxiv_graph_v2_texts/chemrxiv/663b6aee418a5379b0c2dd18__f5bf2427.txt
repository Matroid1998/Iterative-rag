Description:
Required in excess amounts for deacylative transformations of aromatic ketones.

A major challenge 
lies in cleaving the strong C(aryl)C(acyl) bond of the ke
tone. Examples of catalytic cleavage of the C(aryl)C(acyl) 
bond include methods using ring strain release energy of 
smallring aromatic ketones, and oxidative addition of the 
C(alkynyl)C(acyl) bond followed by decarbonylation in al
kynyl ketones (Figure 1B, left ).2123 While these methods 
have been successful with specific types of aromatic ke
tones (activated ketones), applying them to more general 
aromatic alkyl ketones or diaryl ketones (nonactivated ke
tones) as arylation agents has been considered challenging. A challenge with deacylative transformations of aromatic 
ketones has been the requirement for directing groups or 
excess amounts of transition metals.2428 
There are three remarkable examples of decarbonylative 
crosscoupling methods using nonactivated ketones (Fig
ure 1B, right).
