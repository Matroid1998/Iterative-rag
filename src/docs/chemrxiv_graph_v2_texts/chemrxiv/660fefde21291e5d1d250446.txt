Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by ZrN.

Transition metal nitrides (TMN) have gained increasing 
attention as active materials for numerous energy related 
applications including catalysis and energy storage due to their 
unique properties.14 The metal nitrogen bonding in TMN 
consists of covalent, ionic and metallic bonds which influence 
the material characteristics.5 While the metallic bonds lead to 
small electrical resistivities and high corrosion resistance, the 
covalent bonding enhances stress tolerance, accompanied by 
high hardness and brittleness.6,7 Furthermore, the ionic bonding 
leads to comparable electronic structure to that of precious 
metals such as Pd and Pt due to a contraction of the metal d
bands and an expansion of the parent metal lattice.1,6,8 
Among the numerous TMNs, ZrN has been recently identified 
as a promising material for a range of possible applications that 
include plasmonic devices,9 catalyst for oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR)10 and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).11 
Although ZrN displays favourable electrochemical activity to 
ORR and NRR while being cheap and abundant compared to 
commonly employed noble metals,12 in the bulk form 
conventionally used, there are a limited number of active sites 
which significantly reduces the efficiency and hinders its 
implementation in practical catalytic applications.3,12 The (100) 
facets of rocksalt structured ZrN, in addition to other TMNs 
such as CrN, NbN, and VN were theoretically described as 
possibly active and selective for the NRR and stable under 
typical 
electrocatalytic 
potentials.11 
The 
experimental 
evaluation of these computational descriptions is currently 
lacking, mainly due to difficulties in preparing facet controlled 
TMNs.
