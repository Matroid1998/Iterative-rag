Materials with high activity and excellent redox ability used in catalysis, medicine, and energy.

Text:
POMs have been widely used in catalysis, medicine and energy 
due to their high activity and excellent redox ability.89 In recent 
years, researchers have further improved the photocatalytic 
performance of polyoxometalatebased (POMbased) materials 
through the design and regulation of POMs.10 On the one hand, 
the bandgap of POMs can be tuned by changing the type of 
heteroatoms and metal atoms.1112 On the other hand, POMs 
loaded on titanium dioxide (TiO2), zeolite, activated charcoal, and 
other matrix materials achieve synergistic effects between various 
materials and ultimately enhance the photocatalytic activity of 
POMbased materials.9,13 At present, POMbased materials have 
been widely used in photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, 
clean energy conversion and storage, and solar cells.1415 
So far, some studies have systematically reviewed the 
application of POMbased photocatalysts.1011,1618 However, the 
visualization of the overall knowledge structure in this field isnt 
considered, and many research results are not effectively combed.

Description:
Materials used in photocatalysis.

Text:
To use bibliometric methods to investigate the 
knowledge structure of POMbased materials in photocatalysis, it 
is necessary to collect and collate relevant literature and extract 
key information for analysis (such as authors, countries, 
institutions, and keywords).20 
2.1. Data collection 
To ensure the comprehensiveness and authority of the 
relevant literature, the scientific publication of POMbased 
materials in photocatalysis is retrieved from the SCIExpanded in 
the Web of Science (Wos) Core Collection. The database 
contains highquality literature information in many research fields 
such as natural science and engineering technology.2122 In this 
work, we collect relevant literature through topic retrieval. The 
retrieval formula is as follows (TS(polyoxometalate OR 
polyoxometalates OR polyoxometalates oxygen cluster OR 
metaloxo 
cluster 
OR 
metaloxygen 
cluster) 
AND 
TS(photocatalytic OR photocatalysis OR photocatalyst OR 
lightdriven catalyst)).
