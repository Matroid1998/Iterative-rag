Oxidized amines are ubiquitous in organic chemistry and frequently manifest themselves in complex synthesis campaigns the 
Weinreb amide is an exemplar (Figure 1).1 As key components in an impressive portfolio of enabling technologies, routes to generate 
and strategically leverage NO bonds for structural preorganization have been intensively pursued.2 This traceless tether features in 
a range of applications including target synthesis,3 drug delivery mechanisms,4 protein ubiquitylation5 and asymmetric catalysis.6 
Prominent examples include the acyl nitroso DielsAlder reaction (Figure 1A),7 and the nitrile oxide8 and oxime 1,3dipolar cycload
dition9 manifolds (Figure 1B). In contrast, methods to facilitate cleavage of the relatively labile NO(Alkyl) bonds in Weinreb amides 
(5565 kcalmol) are conspicuously underdeveloped and typically rely on disproportionately harsh conditions.
