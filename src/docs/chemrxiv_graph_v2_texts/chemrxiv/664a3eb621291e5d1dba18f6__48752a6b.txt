Description:
A metal-free photocatalyst used to generate H2O2 through oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions.

Text:
Thus, our findings not only reinforce the potential view of metal
free photocatalysts, accelerating the understanding of gC3N4 working principles to generate 
H2O2 based on the oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions, but also propose a facile 
onestep way for fabricating highly efficient and scalable photocatalysts to produce H2O2 
without using sacrificial agents, pushing the practical application of insitu solar H2O2 toward 
realworld scenarios. Keywords gC3N4, mono and cluster vacancies, piezophotocatalysis, solventprecursor 
interactions, H2O2 production
