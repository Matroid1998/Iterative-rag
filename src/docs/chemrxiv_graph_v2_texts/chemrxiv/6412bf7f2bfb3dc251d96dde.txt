Description:
A straightforward alternative to lead in 2D perovskites based on its electronic structure.

7.7 Leadbased 
2D perovskites reported so far are close to 700 compositions, followed by tin (79) and finally 
germanium (2). On the other hand, the recent interest in exploring novel leadfree phases, 
triggered by the high toxicity of lead which will strongly limit the real use of any material 
containing this element, requires to significantly expand the plethora of leadfree 2D 
perovskites.810 In this context, tin based materials, as mentioned above, have received 
significant attention in recent years, being this element a quite straightforward alternative to 
lead based on its electronic structure.
