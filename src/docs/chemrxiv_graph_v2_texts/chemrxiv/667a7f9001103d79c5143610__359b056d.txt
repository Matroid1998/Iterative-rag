Widely established as host materials for ion intercalation reactions.

The charge storage mechanism of lithiumion batteries, as well as of novel cell chemistries 
beyond lithium, is based on electrochemical ion intercalation. The process involves the 
reversible storage of ions in a solidstate host electrode material that is typically undergoing 
small structural changes. Solidstate diffusion of the ions within the host lattice, as well as 
associated volumetric andor crystallographic phase changes of the host itself, can limit the 
kinetics of the intercalation reaction. To realize high power charge storage processes, 
strategies to mitigate such limitations are being developed from an electrode perspective 
across length scales, from the macroscopic particle size scale down to the microscopic atomic 
arrangement within the host.14 
Vanadium oxides are widely established as host materials for ion intercalation reactions.
