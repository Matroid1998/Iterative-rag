Description:
Can be treated with singlet oxygen generated with tetraphenylporphyrin as photocatalyst.

Next, we attempted the oxidative cleavage of the al
lenyl moiety to the corresponding ester 16.22 Although 
examples for ozonolysis of enol ethers in the presence 
of less electronrich olefins have been reported, con
trolled addition of a solution of ozone, even at 115 C, 
resulted in complete degradation of the starting mate
rial.23 Alternatively, enol ethers can be reacted with sin
glet oxygen leading to dioxetanes, which decompose to 
the corresponding esters.24 Singlet oxygen exhibits high 
chemo and regioselectivity depending on substitution 
patterns, conformations and stereoelectronic effects of 
the substrates.25 Gratifyingly, when methoxyallene 15 
was treated with singlet oxygen generated with tetra
phenylporphyrin (TPP) as photocatalyst in a test reac
tion the product could be isolated.
