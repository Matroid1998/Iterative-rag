Description:
A polymer film that can absorb almost 100% of incident thermal radiation at its primary molecular absorption band.

contrast to such relatively broadband coolingdirected applications, chemical sensors require narrowband radiation tuned to a
particular molecular vibrational mode to enable high selectivity and sensitivity detection. Sensors at the telecommunication
spectral window at nearIR7 are especially appealing due to capabilities to integrate them into CMOS (complementary metal
oxidesemiconductor) platform. Hence, development of a thermal radiation emitter with spectral behaviour controlled more
rigorously than lamp sources, and more affordable and ambient temperature compatible than quantum cascade lasers, is in
considerable demand8. It is expected that thermal radiation from a thick polymer lm could be used for narrowband thermal emission purposes. It is
straightforward to experimentally show that a 3 m thick polyimide lm can absorb almost 100 of incident thermal radiation
at its primary molecular absorption band.
