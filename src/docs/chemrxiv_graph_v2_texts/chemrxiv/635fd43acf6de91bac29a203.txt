Description:
Prone to spontaneous hydrolysis under acidic, neutral, or basic conditions.

Elegant examples include the deliv
ery of GFP7 and human ribonuclease 1.8 However, there are 
limitations that must be considered when carboxylate
masking is employed in vivo for the purpose of targeted 
cargo delivery. First, most esters are prone to spontaneous 
hydrolysis under acidic, neutral, or basic conditions.9,10 The 
body features numerous pH gradients (e.g., the pH in the 
gastrointestinal tract ranges from 5.7 to 7.4), which will re
sult in offtarget delivery upon systemic administration. Second, esterhydrolyzing enzymes are ubiquitously ex
pressed throughout the body in nearly all cell types, leading 
to indiscriminate cargo release. In general, ester stability is 
correlated to size and this property has been leveraged to 
tune the pharmacokinetics of drugs such as androgens.
