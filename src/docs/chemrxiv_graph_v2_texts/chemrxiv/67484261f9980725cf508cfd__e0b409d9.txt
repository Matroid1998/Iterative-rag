Description:
Readily eliminates boronic species, formally giving ipsosubstitution products.

Next, the 
carbocation formed readily eliminates boronic species, 
formally giving the ipsosubstitution products.2128 
While typical conditions for the above transfor
mations require an exogeneous radical source (e.g., 
through irradiation), analogous results can be achieved 
by the use of CB transmetalation (Scheme 1, C).2931 
In this case, the selectivity of the reaction is governed 
solely by the boronate moiety position rather than by 
electronic properties of the substrate.
