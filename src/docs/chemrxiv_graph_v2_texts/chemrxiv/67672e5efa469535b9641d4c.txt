Description:
Measured as intracellular content in living magnetotactic bacteria using X-ray nanobeam scanning fluorescence microscopy.

Although the field of liquid cell transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) is well developed, its use is limited to the 
study of thin materials (i.e., only a few hundred nm in 
thickness).15A few studies have imaged individual biological 
cells in liquid using Xray microscopy,1619 but do not follow 
biological processes in situ. As a result, there are few suitable 
liquid cell environments known to be interfaced with Xray 
microscopy techniques to enable nativestate imaging and in 
situ experimentation of biological systems. In this work, Xray nanobeamscanning fluorescence 
microscopy (nanoXRF) is employed to measure the intracellular 
iron content of living magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) in a liquid 
cell environment.
