Description:
Used for the synthesis of transition metal and lanthanide metal species.

Coordination compounds of Mn maintain long standing interest across a breadth of topics from 
bioinorganic chemistry1 to molecular magnetism.2 Key to manipulating and enhancing 
physicochemical behaviour for any application is structural control, and for polymetallic compounds 
the selfassembly process and identity of the final product is largely dominated by choice of bridging 
ligand.3 
We, and others,47 have employed ptBucalix4arene (H4TBC4, Fig. 1A) for the synthesis of a range 
of transition metal (TM) and lanthanide metal (LnM) species in which the TMLnMTBC4 moiety acts 
as a metalloligand that encapsulates an oxohydroxobridged polymetallic core.
