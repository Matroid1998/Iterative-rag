Description:
Used as a catalyst in the synthesis of enantioenriched, redundantly 2,6-substituted cuneanes.

Text:
However, during the preparation of this 
manuscript, Matsubara and coworkers reported the synthesis of 
enantioenriched, redundantly 2,6substituted cuneanes using 
asymmetric silver and (preferentially) palladium catalysts.8 The 
same manuscript describes the racemic, AgIcatalyzed isomeri
zation of 2 asymmetrically 1,4disubstituted cubanes to 2,6di
substituted cuneanes, the first such examples in the literature. In the course of ongoing work involving the alkylation of 
cubane derivatives, we serendipitously observed the highly re
gioselective rearrangement of an asymmetrically 1,4disubsti
tuted cubane to one of the corresponding 1,3cuneane isomers 
(Figure 1D). The value of this regioselectivity was immediately 
apparent as an entry point to a range of differentially 1,3disub
stituted cuneanes. We were surprised to find no literature prec
edent at the time for the rearrangement of such asymmetrically 
disubstituted substrates.
