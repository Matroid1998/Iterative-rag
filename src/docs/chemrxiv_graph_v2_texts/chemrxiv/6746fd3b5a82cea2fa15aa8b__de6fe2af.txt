Results and discussion 
It is known that the reaction of DACs with aldehydes 
under the action of anhydrous GaCl3 is an interesting method for 
the formation of substituted indenes and polycyclic lactones 
2627. Recently we have discovered a novel TaCl5mediated 
transformation of DACs in the presence of two equivalents of
