Description:
A neutral reagent used to differentiate isomeric drug metabolites.

Text:
This approach is limited by the fact that iso
meric ions often generate identical fragmentation patterns, 
making identification via CAD mass spectra unreliable.4,7 To 
address this issue, a MSMS approach based on diagnostic, 
reliable and predictable gasphase ionmolecule reactions has 
been developed.711 This approach can be used to identify spe
cific functional groups or their combinations in separated and 
ionized mixture components to thereby facilitate the differen
tiation of isomeric ions, usually without the need for reference 
compounds. One of the neutral reagents used previously to differentiate 
two isomeric drug metabolites is 2methoxypropene (MOP).7 
In these experiments, protonation of the analyte was achieved 
through atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in a 
linear quadrupole ion trap (LQIT) mass spectrometer.
