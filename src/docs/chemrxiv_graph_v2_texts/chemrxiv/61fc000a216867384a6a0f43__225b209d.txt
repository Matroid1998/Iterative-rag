Functional compounds used in organic and polymer synthesis.

Oxy ringfunctionalized cyanoarylacrylates, R1PhCH  C(CN)CO2R2 have found various 
applications as functional compounds in organic and polymer synthesis. Thus, phenoxy 
ringsubstituted ethyl cyanoarylacrylate (ECAA) was used in synthesis of tetrazoles 
compounds 1; it was a product of condensations catalyzed by triazinebased microporous 
network 2, imidazolium chloride immobilized SBA15 3, and biocatalyst lipase, 
Aspergillus oryzae 4. The ECAA was also used in N,Ndioxidelanthanum(III)
catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation with 2bromomalonates 5. It was employed in 
DBUmediated 4  2 annulations of donoracceptor cyclopropanes 6, in synergistic 
NaBH4 reductioncyclization in synthesis of 3oxabicyclo3.1.0hexane derivatives 7, as 
well as in studies on synthetic access to pyrano3,2c quinoline and 3substituted 
quinoline derivatives 8. Benzyloxy ringsubstituted ECAA was used in synthesis and 
biological evaluation of arylidenethiazolidinediones with potential hypoglycemic and 
hypolipidemic activities 9.
