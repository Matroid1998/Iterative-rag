Description:
A tropane analog used as a targeting ligand with high affinity for monoamine transporters.

All targeting approaches mentioned above require ge
netic alteration of the brain tissue in the species of interest. We wondered whether targeted voltage imaging could be 
achieved by a purely chemical approach. We recently dis
closed VoLDeMo (Voltage sensorliganddextran targeted 
to monoaminergic neurons) as the first example of a VSD 
targeted to specific neuronal subpopulations without the 
use of genetic manipulation.62 In our design, we used di
chloropane, a tropane analog, as a targeting ligand with 
high affinity for monoamine transporters.63,64 As a carrier, 
we used the polysaccharide dextran which compensates 
for the hydrophobic properties of the VSD and functions as 
a molecular platform supporting both the sensor as well as 
the targeting ligand.
