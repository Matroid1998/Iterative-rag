In 1856, Sir William Henry Perkin was the first one who developed the first 
synthetic color and by the turn of century, the use of synthetic colors has been popular 
throughout the USA and Europe in almost all food stuff like mustard, jellies, ketchup 
and wine. At that time more than 80 colors were sold of which some were used for 
dyeing textiles, not for foods. Since the starting 1900s, the most artificial colors were 
originated from aniline, a toxic petroleum product (BFSA, 1989). Due to more 
stability its demand is high. In addition, they are less expensive, add no flavor, blend 
more easily and more concentrated. Coal tar is also a major source from which many 
of synthetic dye are derived.
