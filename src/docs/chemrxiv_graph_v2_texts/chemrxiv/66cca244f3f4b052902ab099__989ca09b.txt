Description:
A widely used material whose properties can be modified by incorporating polar groups.

Text:
Polyethylenebased polymers are the most widely used materials in the world, and their 
distinctive functions can be gained from the incorporation of various polar groups into 
the nonpolar backbones that modifies the surface properties (e.g., adhesiveness, 
compatibility, toughness, adhesion, surface properties, etc.) of polyethylene.13 
Copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl monomers provides a straightforward 
route to prepare functionalized polyethylenebased polymers. However, the current 
methods can only produce random copolymers, and is impossible for the synthesis of 
sequencedefined copolymers (Fig. 1A).
