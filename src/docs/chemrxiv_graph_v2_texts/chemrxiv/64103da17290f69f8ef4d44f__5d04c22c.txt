Description:
Copolymers such as poly(sulfurn1,3diisopropenylbenzene) used to improve lithium-sulfur battery performance.

Lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries are considered as one of the candidates for nextgeneration
energystorage devices. Despite their very high specific energy, commercialization of LiS bat
teries is negatively affected by few drawbacks, such as irreversible capacity fade and volumet
ric expansion of the crystalline sulfur during the discharge. Recently, a huge amount of stud
ies has been concentrated on using polymeric sulfur cathodes to overcome these problems. In
particular, sulfurcarbon copolymers such as poly(sulfurn1,3diisopropenylbenzene) (SDIB)
have attracted much attention. Thanks to a straightforward synthesis procedure,1,2 SDIB
copolymers could be mass produced relatively easily. In addition, it has been demonstrated
that SDIB copolymers show a promising performance in alleviating the shuttle effect and
therefore, can result in a stable cycling performance of a LiS battery.
