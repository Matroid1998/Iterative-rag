Description:
A chemically unstable carboatomic ring.

Text:
The recent successful synthesis and characterization 
of cyclo18carbon by condensed phase experiments 3,4 evokes another longhidden 
identity to carbon chains, that is, they may be the ringopening products of such 
chemically unstable carboatomic rings 5. While conducting theoretical researches on 
cyclo18carbon and its analogues and derivatives 617, we are also interested in the 
properties of these carbon chains of different lengths. Since the electronic spectra of 
cyclic carbon clusters have already been extensively explored 6,8,10, the related 
properties of chainshaped species H(CC)nH with similar electronic structure 
become a subject worthy of study.
