Description:
A cage assembly composed of two Pd(II) ions and four ditopic ligands.

Past efforts on the multicomponent coordination assembly have 
mainly applied thermodynamic approaches by designing building 
blocks to make a single heteloreptic assembly more significantly 
stable than the other possible assemblies.1091 As to the Pd2L4 cage 
assembly composed of two Pd(II) ions and four ditopic ligands (L), 
there are six types of heteroleptic cages (Fig. 1). Type I,92 II,9398 and 
III99,100 cages composed of two kinds of ditopic ligands have mainly 
been produced under thermodynamic control so far and very recently 
a type V cage from three kinds of ditopic ligands was achieved.101 Lack 
of examples of the other types of heteroleptic Pd2L4 cages implies the 
limitation of thermodynamic approach for the creation of a variety of 
complicated multicomponent assemblies.

Description:
Heteroleptic cages formed through kinetically controlled self-assembly.

Text:
Kinetic chemical 
reactions are controlled by pathway selection, so towards kinetically 
controlled selfassembly, modulation of the energy landscapes is 
demanded so that a desired assembly can be produced exclusively 
through a proper assembly pathway. Here we present a kinetic approach of the assembly of all six types 
of heteroleptic Pd2L4 and tetranuclear Pd(II) cages by modulation of 
the energy landscapes. It was found that the selective exchange of 
weak ligands is possible on Pd(II) centers retaining its original 
orientation and that the kinetic stability of the resulting metastable 
species can be enhanced by rigid cyclic structures.
