Description:
A monomer used in copolymerization with polar vinyl monomers to create functionalized polymers.

Text:
Polyethylenebased polymers are the most widely used materials in the world, and their 
distinctive functions can be gained from the incorporation of various polar groups into 
the nonpolar backbones that modifies the surface properties (e.g., adhesiveness, 
compatibility, toughness, adhesion, surface properties, etc.) of polyethylene.13 
Copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl monomers provides a straightforward 
route to prepare functionalized polyethylenebased polymers. However, the current 
methods can only produce random copolymers, and is impossible for the synthesis of 
sequencedefined copolymers (Fig. 1A).

Description:
A nonpolar olefin used in copolymerization with polar vinyl monomers.

Text:
For instance, freeradical polymerization can 
be applied in the production of ethylenepolar monomer (e.g., acrylates, acrylic acid, 
vinyl acetate) copolymers, this method encounters the substantial difference of 
reactivity ratios between ethylene and polar vinyl monomers and leads to random 
polymers with low molecular weights and chains containing a significant amount of 
branches.46 Moreover, in coordination polymerization the polar groups act 
detrimentally to the transitionmetal catalysts, primarily due to the poisoning of the 
catalysts.713 In this scenario, the innovation of advanced strategies to produce the 
polyolefins consisting of polar blocks in accurate sequence control is highly 
desirable.1418 
Designing new olefins by integration of polar moieties into nonpolar olefins 
backbone transforms the original copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl
