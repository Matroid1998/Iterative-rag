Description:
Used in Ptalloy nanoparticles for improved Pt utilization and higher kinetic activity towards the ORR.

On the other hand, dealloyed Ptalloy (PtM) 
nanoparticles (NPs) with less expensive 3d transition metals (M  Ni, Cu, Co) supported on 
high surface area carbon supports, are currently the stateoftheart (SoA) solution to reach the 
production phase in PEMFCs 11,12  resulting from their facile and already at scale preparation. Cost reduction using Ptalloys is possible due to two key features (i) Ptalloys dilute Ptatoms 
inside the nanoparticles core and thus improve Pt overall utilisation 1316 and (ii) they exhibit 
a higher kinetic activity towards the ORR due to a combination of a ligand, strain, coordination 
number andor surface disorder effects 1723.
