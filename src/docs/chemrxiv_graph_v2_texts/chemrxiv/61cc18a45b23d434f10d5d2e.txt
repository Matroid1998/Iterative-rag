Description:
Leached by copper-based paints, it has potential disruptive effects on the biodiversity of coastal macrofouling communities.

Text:
One such paint is 
designed to last 35 years, gradually releasing all the incorporated biocides, causing a 
significant (and global) impact on marine life.5 
For example, a recent study on copperbased paints in the Venice lagoon revealed that 
copper leached by these paints has potential disruptive effects on the biodiversity of 
coastal macrofouling communities affecting both the settlement and growth of key species 
of macrofouling of hardsubstrata.6
