Description:
A potent and selective platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist.

Text:
This herculean achievement was documented in a 
series of backtoback publications, which detailed their 
isolation, 
characterisation, 
stereochemistry, 
and 
derivatisation.26 The structures were confirmed the same year 
by Xray crystallographic analysis by Okabe of the para
bromobenzoate of ginkgolide A.7 The ginkgolides are potent 
and 
selective 
plateletactivating 
factor 
(PAF) 
receptor 
antagonists,8 yet the potential link between this antagonism 
and their biological effects remains unknown.1, 9 
The structural complexity of the ginkgolides includes a tert
butyl group (seldom present in natural products),1013 six 
heavilyfunctionalised fivemembered rings and up to 12 
stereogenic centres. Two of the contiguous stereocentres in the 
ginkgolides are allcarbon quaternary centres (highlighted in 
yellow in Figure 1A), which are challenging to construct in a 
stereoselective manner.
