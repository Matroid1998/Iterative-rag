Description:
A diatomic gas that is inert under most conditions and is used as a cryogen at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

Text:
The 
highest TB has been reported by Guo et al.30, for organometallic 
Dy(III) complex displaying magnetic hysteresis at temperatures 
reaching 80 K. That discovery could facilitate development of 
SIM devices that function at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
