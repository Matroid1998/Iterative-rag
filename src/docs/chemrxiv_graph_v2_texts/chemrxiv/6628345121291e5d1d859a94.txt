Description:
Participates in a highly efficient and rapid bioorthogonal Diels-Alder cycloaddition with transcyclooctenes.

Text:
The DielsAlder cycloaddition between 1,2,4,5tetrazines and transcyclooctenes is a highly 
eicient and rapid bioorthogonal reaction.1 After an initial inverse electron demand DielsAlder 
reaction, which is the rate limiting step, a retroDielsAlder with loss of N2 gives a 
dihydropyridazine (Figure 1).2 Owing to its biocompatibility and high reactivity, this reaction is 
used in in vivo applications such as pretargeted radiolabeling3 and targeted drug release.4 In these 
applications, high reactivity is the most crucial property. The kinetics of such reactions have been 
the focus of intensive investigation in numerous experimental and computational studies, aimed 
at understanding and improving reactivity.510

have become increasingly common.
