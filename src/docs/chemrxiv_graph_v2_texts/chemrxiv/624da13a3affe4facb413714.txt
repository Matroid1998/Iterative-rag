Description:
Can be incorporated into peptide structures with high accuracy and are biocompatible.

Peptide based porous frameworks are an emerging class of 
materials, which have found applications as adaptive13and 
reversibly tuneable,4 porous materials, capable of capturing 
greenhouse gases,57 and, due to their inherent chirality, have 
found 
applications 
in 
facilitating 
chiral 
events 
and 
transformations,8,9 and separating chiral drugs8,10. Peptides can 
be prepared at scale with high purity, have canonical and non
canonical amino acids incorporated into their primary structure 
with high accuracy and are biocompatible.
