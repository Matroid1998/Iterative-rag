Cyclocarbon is a cyclic molecule composed of sphybridized carbons connected 
to each other. Earlier, cyclocarbons have been explored experimentally and there are 
evidences of their formation in the gas phase,14 but for a long time, no one can 
provide direct molecular morphology for them. In 2019, cyclo18carbon (C18) was 
first observed in the condensed phase,5 ending a longstanding controversy over the 
structure of this unique carbon allotrope and reigniting a wave of research on it.

Description:
Molecules with high reactivity that can fuse through covalent coupling, allowing for molecular polymerization into bigger carbon rings.

Over 
the next three years, scientists synthesized cycloncarbon molecules with various 
sizes, including n  6,6 10,7 12,6 13,8 14,7 16,9 20,10 and 26.8 Theoretical 
chemists have also conducted extensive research on the special properties and 
potential applications of cyclocarbon systems in recent years, among which we have 
achieved meaningful results in many aspects of C18 and related compounds, including 
geometric structure, electronic structure, ring strain, aromaticity, optical nonlinearity, 
intermolecular interaction, external field effect, dynamic behavior, excited state, and 
so on.1127 
Multiple works have speculated or confirmed that the high reactivity of 
cyclocarbons and their precursors allows them to fuse through covalent coupling, 
opening up avenues for molecular polymerization into bigger carbon rings.5,9 There 
are also indications that cyclocarbons are valuable precursors for building 
threedimensional carbon networks28 and forming fullerenes in graphite 
vapor.29 These statements all imply the possibility of encountering cyclocarbon 
molecules and other carbon materials in real space.
