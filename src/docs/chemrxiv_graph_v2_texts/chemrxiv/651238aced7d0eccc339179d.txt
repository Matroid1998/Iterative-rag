Text:
Chemistryrelated industries and living practices are increasingly becoming the main 
contributors to environmental deterioration in this era due to the use of various toxic agents. Besides that, the rapid population growth and industrialization pose a strong need for energy 
supplements and consumption worldwide. Nevertheless, fossilfuelbased energy has severely 
impacted the surrounding environment due to releasing a large quantity of carbon dioxide 
(CO2). Thus, shifting from conventional to sustainable energy sources is the guiding goal for 
academic studies and industries. Accordingly, among various renewable sources, solar energy 
is an ideal choice to mitigate the concerns in the chaotic century 1, 2, 3.
