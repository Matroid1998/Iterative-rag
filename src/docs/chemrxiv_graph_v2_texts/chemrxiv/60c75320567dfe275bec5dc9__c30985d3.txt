Description:
Used as an example in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions to determine regioselectivity by finding the protonated isomer with the lowest free energy.

In
this paper, we show that the open source semiempirical software package xtb can be used
in place of MOPAC without impacting the accuracy of the predictions. We go on to show
that the accuracy can be increased by considering dierent tautomeric forms of the molecule
and oer a qualitative prediction of the reactivity of each tautomer. Finally, we compare
the accuracy of the new version (RegioSQM20) to two MLbased models for regioselectivity
predictions. complex

uorobenzene as an example. RegioSQM approximates the Br complex as protonation
(shown as blue structures) and determines regioselectivity by nding the protonated isomer
with lowest free energy. 2
