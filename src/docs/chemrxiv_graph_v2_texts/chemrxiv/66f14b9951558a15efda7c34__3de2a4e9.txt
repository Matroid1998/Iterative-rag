Description:
Exhibits modest uptake at 273K, indicating limited ultramicropore distribution.

Direct 
comparison of this N2 adsorption data with that of the previously prepared PUNCCocbipyCo (Fig. 1c; SABET  845, Vmp  0.44 ml g1) indicates that the TPP guest molecules occupy around 50 of the 
free volume of the basic PNC structure (Fig. 3a). The modest uptake of CO2 at 273K by 
PUNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP (Fig. 5b) suggests that only a small fraction of the total pore volume 
is distributed as ultramicropores, defined as pores of less than 7  in diameter, which is consistent 
with the crystal structure of the PNC, for which only the narrow channels linking the voids are 
ultramicroporous.

Description:
A gas that can be uptaken by materials with increased ultramicroporosity.

Text:
Notably, the CO2 uptake for PUNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP is significantly 
higher than that of PUNCCocbipyCo, which is consistent with the increase in ultramicroporosity 
due to the included TPP increasing the length of the narrow interconnecting channels from 9  to 
15 , as measured from the scXRD structure. The resulting permanently porous PUNCvTPPCo
cbipyCovTPP possesses metalfree porphyrins suitable for metal cation incorporation via post
synthetic modification. Hence the crystals were exposed to a methanol solution of CuCl2 and the 
successful insitu incorporation of Cu2 to give PNCvTPPCuCocbipyCovTPPCu was confirmed 
by scXRD, which showed that the resulting CuCo distance is only 3.51 . Similarly, Co2 could be 
introduced into the TPP by exposure to a solution of CoCl2 to produce PNCvH2OCoTPPCocbipy
CovTPPCoOH2 with a CoCo distance of 3.52 .
