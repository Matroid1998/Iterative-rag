Description:
Observed as one of the most abundant ices.

Text:
Among the observed ices, water ice is the most abun
dant followed by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as smaller
amounts of organic molecules such as methane (CH4) and methanol (CH3OH)23. Gasphase chemistry (including barrierless ionmolecule24 and radicalmolecule reac
tions) and gasgrain chemistry are possible pathways for the production of many
of the observed species8, 2528. The formation of different organic molecules in
environments where temperatures are greater than 30 K can be explained via radi
cal recombination mechanisms; the formation of radicals is followed by diffusion and
recombination into larger molecular species5, 29, 30. At very low temperatures ( 20 K), diffusion of some of the radical species may
be limited and different lowtemperature channels for organicmolecule formation are
expected.
