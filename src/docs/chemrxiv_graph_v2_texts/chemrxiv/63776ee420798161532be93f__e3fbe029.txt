Description:
A compound involved in semihydrogenation reactions catalyzed by Pd(2pymo)2n.

Text:
Pd(2pymo)2n (2pymo  2pyrimidinolate) is the 
only currently known MOF using these kind of nodes and was first 
reported by Navarro et al.27 Its catalytic performance has already 
been studied on the olefin hydrogenation of 1octene and 
cyclodecene,2830 the oxidation of alcohols,3133 for the Suzuki
Miyaura 
crosscoupling 
reaction 
of 
arenediazonium 
tetrafluoroborate salts with arylboronic acids34 and for 
phenylacetylene semihydrogenation in water.18 The reported 
data show promising results especially for the selective catalytic 
hydrogenation but also the possibility of the reduction of Pd2 to 
Pd0 under reductive conditions, resulting in the collapse of the 
structure.2829 In this work, we explore the outstanding 
performance of the Pd(2pymo)2n MOF for the selective catalytic 
hydrogenation of acetylene under industrially relevant reaction 
conditions.
