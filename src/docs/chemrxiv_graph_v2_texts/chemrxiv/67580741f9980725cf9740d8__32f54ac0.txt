Description:
A thermoresponsive polymer that changes behavior below and above its lower critical solution temperature.

Text:
Adaptive materials, being a broader 
term, exhibit specific responses to external stimuli, enabling them to reversible transition 
between equilibrium states, between equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, or between 
multiple nonequilibrium states.9 
In the previous research, we presented the formation of the airwater interfacial adaptive 
system with FexOySiO2NPs capped with poly(Nisopropyl acrylamide) (ligand  PNIPAM, 
particles  PSiFe) as a building block.14 We provided data, an explanation of phenomena 
observed in the system, and an efficient deposition method for such hydrophilic nanomaterials 
on the water surface. Thermoresponsive PSiFe showed different behavior in two temperature 
regimes  below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) due to the changes 
in polymer chains capped on the surface of the nanoparticles.
