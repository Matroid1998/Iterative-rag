Description:
Compounds that can undergo substitution reactions with PS bonds.

Text:
The propensity of the PS bonds in these 
building blocks to undergo substitution by both alcohols and organometallic reagents was 

demonstrated and enables the synthesis of a variety of stereogenicatP(V) compounds, ranging 
from oligonucleotides to chiral phosphine oxides.
