Description:
A chemical element that can substitute for Sr in apatite, affecting its color.

Text:
One such example is the doping of Mn5 which can be doped onto the tetrahedral site and is 
noted to produce an intense turquoise colour 19. Despite the interest in this pigment material, there have been no studies of the effect of 
substitution of Ba for Sr, which offers the ability to examine how the different site preferences 
of Ba and Sr affect the colour of the resultant apatite. Consequently, through a third year 
undergraduate minilab project, we investigated 
the effect of 
Sr doping in 
Ba10(MnO4)(PO4)5Cl2.
