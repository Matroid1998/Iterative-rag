Description:
Investigated via Density Functional Theory for its potential in optoelectronics.

Text:
Despite aforementioned 
challenges, beryllium has been ubiquitous in industries such as nuclear, aerospace, medical and manufacturing due to small 
atomic (112 pm) and ionic radii (45 pm) inducing strong covalent bond resultant material properties of low density (1.85 
gcm3), tensile strength exceeding 700 MPa, high melting point (1560 K), modulus of elasticity (303 GPa), neutron 
reflectivity and oxidative resistance. Motivated by the potential of ternary beryllium oxides for optoelectronics applications, 
BeSeO3 is investigated via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that operate by approximation of manyelectron 
wavefunction systems via electron density computation (Eq.1) with an associated local density approximation of the 
exchangecorrelation correction to account for electronelectron interactions 3,4,5.

Description:
A material whose optoelectronic properties such as band gap, density of states, refractive index, and absorption coefficient are calculated using the Quantum Espresso DFT package.

Text:
Semiconductors with band gap greater 
than 2 eV are classified as wideband gap (WBG) materials notable for properties of elevated thermal conductivity and high 
dielectric strength for high power applications along with high optical absorptivity and visible light emission for 
optoelectronic applications in comparison to standard semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium. Band gap refers 
to the minimum energy required for electron transition from valence to conduction band in a material, higher band gap of 
WBG semiconductors is responsible for operational utility at higher temperatures and visible light spectrum range of 
emission utilized by photonics technology. Using the Quantum Espresso DFT package, optoelectronic properties of BeSeO3 
such as band gap, density of states, refractive index and absorption coefficient are calculated.
