Description:
Facilitates extension of p-conjugation with reduced band gaps via overlap of the unoccupied pz orbital on boron with antibonding p orbitals of adjacent organic systems.

In contrast, 
tricoordinate boron has been shown to facilitate extension of pconjugation with ensuing 
reduced band gaps via overlap of the unoccupied pz orbital on boron with antibonding p 
orbitals of adjacent organic psystems (Figure 1a, B).3 Largely reduced band gaps have also 
been achieved by linking together tetracoordinate boron complexes, such as dipyrromethenes 
(BODIPYs, C)4 or boron formazanates (D)5 to generate conjugated dimers, oligomers, and 
polymers (Figure 1b).6 Borondoped pconjugated polymers are attractive as pivotal 
components in electronic and optoelectronic devices,
