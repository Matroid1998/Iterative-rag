Description:
Known for its air instability in Sn2 cation form.

Tin (Sn)based 
perovskites, highly investigated for Pbfree solar cells, are not ideal for IPVs due to their 
narrow bandgap and the known airinstability of Sn2 cation.3,4 Perovskiteinspired 
pnictohalides employing cations from Group VA of the periodic table (e.g., antimony (III) 
(Sb3) and bismuth (III) (Bi3)) have recently emerged as promising lowtoxicity and highly 
stable absorbers for IPVs, owing to their bandgap of around 2 eV, which is nearly ideal for 
indoor lightharvesting.5,6 However, so far only a small handful of IPV studies have been 
reported5,7,8,9,10 with PCE(i) values already in the same range of commercially available 
hydrogenated amorphous silicon (aSiH) devices,11,12 though still far from the maximum 
theoretical PCE(i) of 5060.5,6 Indeed, all the reported PCE(i) values stagnate around 56 
at 1000 lux white lightemitting diode (WLED) illumination, with the highest record being so 
far 6.4.10 The reasons for such modest efficiencies lie in the low opencircuit voltage (VOC) 
and shortcircuit current density (JSC) values, mainly due to poor charge carrier transport 
resulting from abundant intrinsic defects and other typical recombination losses in this class of 
materials, such as selftrapping.13,14 
Despite being one of the most recently discovered pnictohalides, Cu2AgBiI6 (CABI) has 
already gained an exceptional interest from the photovoltaic and optoelectronic community 
owing to its direct bandgap, high absorption coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and the 
desired band gap of  2 eV for IPVs.8,9,15,16,17,18 Several works have contributed to improving 
CABI discontinuous morphology, consisting of smallsized grains and numerous cracks, by
