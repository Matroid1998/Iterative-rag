Description:
Sustainable, tunable, nontoxic, and chemically stable materials used in photocatalytic systems for light-driven reactions such as hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction.

Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN) are sustainable, tunable, nontoxic and chemically stable 
materials,14 that have been utilized in the construction of various photocatalytic systems for 
a wide range of lightdriven reactions, including hydrogen evolution,510 water oxidation,6, 
11, 12 CO2 reduction,13, 14 organic pollutant degradation,1517 or selective chemical 
conversions 1821. Notably, a vast majority of the studies on PCNbased photocatalytic 
systems encompassed investigations of suspensions of PCN powders, whereas studies of 
photoelectrocatalytic systems utilizing PCNbased photoelectrodes are much less frequent. In 
this context, it is important to realize that  apart from some drawbacks (e.g., increased 
installation costs due to photoelectrode and reactor fabrication)  there are several advantages
