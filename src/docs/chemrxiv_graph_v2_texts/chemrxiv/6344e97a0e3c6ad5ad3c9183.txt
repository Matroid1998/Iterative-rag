Description:
A quaternary diamondlike semiconductor used to demonstrate the usage of VTAnDeM.

Text:
VTAnDeM is an opensource soft
ware available and maintained on a Github repository https
github.comertekinresearchgroupVTAnDeM. In
this paper, we use the quaternary diamondlike semiconductor
Cu2HgGeTe4 11,12,33 as an exemplary multicomponent material to
demonstrate the usage of VTAnDeM. The effects of phase bound
aries on the defect formation energetics and resulting carrier con
centrations are visualized, and the interactive nature of VTAn
DeM is demonstrated. We encourage that the workow, analysis,
and gures presented here be interpreted as an example of the
application of VTAnDeM towards analyzing thermodynamic and
electronic properties of materials, especially materials for which
defect engineering may tune or alter fundamental properties.
