Atoms whose oxidation state depends on their coordination environment and the stoichiometry of the ceria substrate.

species with n 1, 2, or 4) either occupying Ce positions of the ceria lattice or deposited 
on undercoordinated sites of ceria substrates. The oxidation state of Pt atoms depends on 
their coordination environment and on the stoichiometry of ceria substrate, which can 
either accept or donate electrons by varying the occupation of the Ce4f states (reducing 
Ce4 cations to Ce3 and vice versa) andor the amount of O in the ceria lattice. Atomically dispersed Pt has often been distinguished from metallic nano or 
subnano Pt particles by the characteristic shifts of cationic Pt in XRay Photoemission 
Spectroscopy (XPS).2,23,24 Nevertheless, recent studies report the formation of small 
oxidized Pt particles (i.e.
