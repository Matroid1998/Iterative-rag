The fluorescence properties of the DTEbased pyrene derivatives 1 and 2 were investigated in 
solution at room temperature with a concentration of c.a. 106 M, diluted enough to exclude 
intermolecular excimer (Figure S30). The monopyrene compound 2 is nonemissive due to rapid 
competitive ringclosure reaction triggered by irradiation of UV light, which agrees with the 
photocyclization quantum yield determined at almost unity. However, the DTEbased bispyrene 1 
exhibits excimeric emission (Figure 3, Table 1).
