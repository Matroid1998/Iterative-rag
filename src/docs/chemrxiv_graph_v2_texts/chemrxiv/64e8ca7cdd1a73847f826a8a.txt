Description:
A ring structure with electron delocalization and aromaticity.

Text:
When Kekul first pictured the ring structure of benzene,1 hardly anyone could have imagined 
that electron delocalization and aromaticity may play a central role in an incredible variety of 
inorganic rings and 3D clusters containing s, d and even fblock metal atoms.2 Very recently, 
Boronski et al.
