Description:
A product of nucleoside phosphorolysis by nucleoside phosphorylases.

As such, 
truly efficient nucleoside synthesis is still considered an 
unmet challenge in organic chemistry, despite more than 
seven decades of research in the field.11 
To circumvent many of the challenges encountered during 
conventional nucleoside synthesis, increased efforts have 
recently been made toward the development of biocatalytic 
methods.12 As a result of this trend, the greater enzyme 
family of nucleoside phosphorylases13 has witnessed a true 
renaissance.14,15 Natively, these enzymes perform the 
phosphorolysis of nucleosides, yielding the corresponding 
nucleobase and pentose 1phosphate (Figure 1). Since this 
transformation is fully reversible,16 they can also be 
employed for the synthesis of nucleosides, either from the 
corresponding sugar phosphate or by transglycosylation 
from a sacrificial glycosyl donor.
