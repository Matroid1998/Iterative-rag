Description:
A metal ion not directly involved in biological processes, detectable due to its toxicity at low concentrations.

The use of maingroup elements in sensing 
applications has expanded greatly in recent years. The Lewis acidic character of many maingroup 
elements has allowed for the development of sensors 
for an array of substrates, including halide ions,1 and 
small molecules such as nitrous oxide and carbon 
monoxide.2 Another key class of substrates for such 
sensors are metal ions. The sensing of metal ions 
used in biological processes, such as iron and copper, 
is vital for medical contexts whereby either an excess 
or deficiency can cause health issues.3 The ability to 
sense metal ions not directly involved in biological 
processes, 
such 
as 
aluminium, 
also 
retains 
importance due to their toxicity at even low 
concentrations.4 Therefore, sensors that can detect 
these metals quickly and selectively is of widespread 
interest.
