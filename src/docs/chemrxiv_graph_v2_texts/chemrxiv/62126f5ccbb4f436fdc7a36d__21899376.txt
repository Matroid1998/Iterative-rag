Description:
Undergo sp3 CH functionalization using cocatalytic palladium acetate and glycine.

Text:
A transient directing group approach was 
first described by Jun for the alkylation of aldehydic CH bonds.4 
In 2016, Yu reignited interest in this field by demonstrating 
powerful benzylic and sp3 CH functionalization of aldehydes and 
ketones respectively using cocatalytic palladium acetate and 
glycine to form a transient coordinating imine.5 In 2017, Yu 
reported 
the 
palladium 
catalyzed 
transient 
orthoCH 
functionalization 
of 
benzaldehydes, 
achieving 
arylation, 
bromination and chlorination with imines derived from anilines 
(Figure 1b).6 Contemporaneously, Sorensen developed C(sp2)
H hydroxylation, fluorination and methylation processes.7 
Noticeably there are no examples of CS bond formation using 
transient CH functionalization. Furthermore, the majority of 
transient directing groups use precious metal catalysis, mainly 
palladium, but also rhodium, ruthenium and iridium.3,8,9
