Description:
A ligand that replaces chlorine ions in Re2Cl4(dppm)2.

Text:
Re2Cl4(dppm)2 complex, where dppm is Ph2PCH2PPh2, have 
firstly synthesised in 1976 and the solidstate structure was 
determined later in 1985.1,2 It is structure shows two Re ions 
bridged by two dppm ligands, each one of the Re atom bounds to 
two chlorine ions. Since then, several complexes have been 
synthesised based on this molecule for carrying out extensive 
reaction chemistry involving ReRe multiple bonds. For example, 
the reaction of Re2Cl4(dppm)2 with cyanotrihydroborate ligands 
replace all the four chlorine ions with BH3CN.3 The four chlorine 
ions were also replaced by CH3 by reacting Re2Cl4(dppm)2 with 
CH3Li to form Re2(dppm)2(CH3)4.
