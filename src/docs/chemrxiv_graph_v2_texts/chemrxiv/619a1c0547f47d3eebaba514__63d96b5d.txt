Description:
Compounds that require local PtG plants to avoid costly transport infrastructure and inefficiencies in distribution.

Using highly concentrated CO2 from those sources also offers to reduce industrial CO2 
emissions significantly. In perspective, this technology can be applied to achieve negative emissions, 
as well, if CO2 from ambient air is used as reactant (House et al., 2011; Goeppert et al., 2012; Dittmeyer 
et al., 2019). Such point sources for renewable energy and carbon oxides require local PtG plants in 
order to avoid costly transport infrastructure and inefficiencies in distribution (Vogt et al., 2019). This 
also requires plants at a smaller scale tailored to the local availability of the carbon and energy 
resources. Due to economic reasons such small scale plants, though, probably exhibit small buffer 
capacities to dampen fluctuations originating from renewable resources (Vogt et al., 2019; Theurich et 
al., 2020).
