Description:
A well-known heat-resistant polymer material that starts to decompose at temperatures above 350Â°C.

This indicates that it is
possible to realize a very useful narrowband light source for an
alytical systems at the IR absorption window, where such sources
and spectral filters are not (or less) available. Based on the previous studies, an IR light source can be made
harnessing selected molecular vibration and it has a high poten
tial for miniaturisation of IR optical sensors. However, when
organic molecules are used, heat resistance of polymer restricts
range of temperatures at which MIM structure can be used. For
example, even polyimide, a wellknown heatresistant polymer
material, starts to decompose at temperatures above 350C, re
ducing potential use of such metasurface as temperature driven
blackbody emitter.
