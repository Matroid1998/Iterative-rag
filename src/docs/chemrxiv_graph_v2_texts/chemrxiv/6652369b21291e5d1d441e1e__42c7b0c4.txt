Description:
Used as a single source precursor in chemical vapor deposition.

To enable the use of rBxC in such devices, there is a need to develop and 
understand thin film deposition processes for highquality, phase pure epitaxial rBxC films. We recently showed that rB4C can be epitaxially grown using chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) with triethylborane (TEB, B(CH2CH3)3) as a single source precursor and 4HSiC as 
substrates at 1300 C.21 The B4C films grew epitaxially on the (0001) surface of 4HSiC, 
commonly known as the Cface 4HSiC, with the inplane epitaxial relationship 
B4C(0001)1010 4HSiC(0001)1010.
