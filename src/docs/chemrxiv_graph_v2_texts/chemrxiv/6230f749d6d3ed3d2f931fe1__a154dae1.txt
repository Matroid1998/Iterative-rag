Owing to its high volumetric energy density and facile liquefaction at moderate 
temperature and pressure conditions,1 renewablygenerated ammonia is a compelling lowcarbon 
fuel for the heavy transportation sector.2 
Fully electrochemical processes for ammonia generation, consuming only nitrogen, water, 
and renewable electricity, have received a great deal of recent interest in academic research, as 
they can operate at nearambient conditions and respond dynamically to power supply 
intermittencies.3,4 Despite labscale reports of fully electrochemical ammonia generation processes 
of all stripes, including high temperature electrochemical processes,57 ambientcondition 
processes using aqueous8,9 and nonaqueous electrolytes,1013 batch semielectrochemical 
processes,14,15 as well as plasmabased processes,16,17 these approaches are nearly universally 
assessed to lack the efficiency and robustness required to produce ammonia economically at scale 
in their present form.

In this work, we carry out a holistic technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of the 
costoptimal design and operation of a fully electrochemical ammonia generation process that 
relies on intermittent renewable energy sources, setting out to identify key productivity metrics 
that are necessary for economic viability. Specifically, we find that a fully electrochemical reactor 
capable of synthesizing ammonia at partial currents exceeding 400 mA cm2 and energy 
efficiencies exceeding 30 can operate costcompetitively, i.e. at costs of 1 kg NH3, with 
processes using renewable electricitybasedhydrogen coupled with the traditional HaberBosch 
process.

Description:
Synthesized by reacting nitrogen and hydrogen at high temperature and pressure in large, centralized plants.

Text:
Processes which utilize watersplitting derived hydrogen and traditional HaberBosch 
reactors report ammonia costs of 0.81.2 kg NH3,1821 though there are reports of ammonia costs 
in the 0.40.6 kg NH3 as well.22 However, there are several drawbacks to these processes that 
could make a fully electrical ammonia production approach attractive. HaberBosch ammonia is synthesized by reacting nitrogen and hydrogen at high 
temperature and pressure in large, centralized plants.4 Typically, the hydrogen is derived from 
fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, most commonly via the steam reforming process.

Description:
Produced using the Haber-Bosch process, contributing to approximately 1.5% of worldwide CO2 emissions.

Text:
Utilizing 
fossil fuels for hydrogen production as well as thermal energy results in significant carbon dioxide 
emissions, ranging from a theoretical minimum of 1.8 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for natural gas23, to 
around 3.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for coal;21,24 the global average CO2 emissions are approximately 
2.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3.23 As a result of tremendous worldwide demand driven primarily by the 
fertilizer and chemicals industry, HaberBosch ammonia produced from fossilfuel derived 
hydrogen accounts for approximately 1.5 of worldwide CO2 emissions.23 If transportation fuels 
are to comprise another source of demand for ammonia, it is critical to mitigate the carbon footprint 
associated with current methods of ammonia production.
