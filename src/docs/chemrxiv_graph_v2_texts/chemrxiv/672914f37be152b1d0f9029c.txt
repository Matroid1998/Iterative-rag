Description:
Used as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries, posing challenges due to interfacial impedance growth.

Text:
For example, parasitic reactions between the electrolyte and AMs can cause severe 
interfacial impedance growth, especially at high temperatures, which poses a significant challenge 
for commercially relevant LIB AMs like layered oxide cathodes and silicon anodes 5,6. The electrochemical kinetics of LIB AMs can generally be separated into bulk (i.e., 
diffusion) kinetics and interfacial (i.e., chargetransfer) kinetics, although in many cases these are 
highly interdependent. In the literature, the interfacial chargetransfer kinetics of LIB AMs are 
generally assumed to follow the ButlerVolmer equation (BV), which describes the relationship 
between current (I) and overpotential () based on two kinetic parameters, the exchange current 
(I0) and the transfer coefficient ().
