Description:
Forms skeletons similar to those in abietane terpenoids.

Text:
Of note, carbon skele
tons similar to 4Bk can be observed in abietane terpe
noids.39 Although the yield of 4Bk is modest, we believe 
that the success in rapid construction of such a skeleton 
could potentially be utilized in synthetic and biological 
studies on related diterpenoids. This varied substrate scope 
clearly showed that the present methodology can give rise 
to a wide range of polycyclic skeletons simply by tuning the 
substituents of these readily available starting materials. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024dnf75 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000238965882 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
