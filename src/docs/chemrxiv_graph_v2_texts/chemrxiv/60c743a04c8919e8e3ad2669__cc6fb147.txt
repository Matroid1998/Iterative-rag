Description:
Arranged into two-dimensional layers with boron and nitrogen atoms covalently bound in an alternating hexagonal pattern.

This includes the 
voltammetric behavior at inlaid microdisk electrodes, put forth by Feldberg, who predicted 
peculiar deviations of the steadystate voltammograms from the commonlyused ButlerVolmer 
model of electrochemical kinetics.5 
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is arranged into twodimensional (2D) layers, in which 
boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bound in an alternating hexagonal pattern, similar to 
graphene. These layers are held together by van der Waals (vdW) forces in bulk hBN.
