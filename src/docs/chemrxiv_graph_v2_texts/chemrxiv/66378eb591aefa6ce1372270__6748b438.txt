Description:
Can react with lacuna in polyoxotungstates to form new structures.

Text:
As a rule of thumb, tungsten clusters are the most 
structurally robust in the POM family; hence, partial hydrolysis of tungsten derived polyoxo clusters, 
achieved through the controlled addition of base produces lacunary clusters.8 This straightforward 
synthetic method forms one or several metal voids in the structure of the POM molecule. The defective 
region, named lacuna, can react with other transitionmetal cations forming a new structure, for example 
MMnIII, CoIII, FeIII, TiIV, NiII, CrIII and ZrIV, amongst others. Monotransitionmetalsubstituted 
polyoxotungstates, explored in this work have the formula M(L)XW11O39q (X  P(V) or Si(IV), L
