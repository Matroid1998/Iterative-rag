Description:
Mimic a carbonyl group in bioactive compounds and increase water solubility, improve metabolic stability, and lower lipophilicity of organic molecules.

Text:
. More than a decade ago, oxetanes received a 
second breath, when they were shown to mimic a carbonyl 
group in bioactive compounds (Scheme 1). Moreover, the 
oxetane fragment was demonstrated to increase water 
solubility, improve metabolic stability, and lower the 
lipophilicity of organic molecules.1 Since that time oxetanes 
have been gaining popularity in different areas of chemistry 
including organic synthesis, chemical biology, and medicinal 
chemistry.24 In particular, oxetanecarboxylic acids have been 
mentioned in 200 peerreviewed manuscripts and patents as 
both bioactive compounds5 and starting materials in synthesis 
(Scheme 1).6 Not surprising that during the past years, we 
received many requests for their preparation. Some oxetane
carboxylic acids were known in the literature, some of them we 
needed to synthesize for the first time.

Description:
Compounds that can undergo intramolecular isomerizations by nucleophiles.

Text:
Over time, however, we 
realized that many oxetanecarboxylic acids were intrinsically 
unstable  they easily isomerized into lactones under storage at 
room temperature or under slight heating. Here, we want to 
disclose this unknown in the literature phenomenon, as 
chemists keep on using these molecules (Scheme 1), without 
realizing that many of them are unstable, as that could 
dramatically affect reaction yields and lead to negative results 
(especially in those reactions that require heating). Intended intramolecular isomerizations of oxetanes by 
nucleophiles were reported in the literature (Scheme 1).7,8 In 
most cases these reactions required additional activation of the 
oxetane ring by Lewisacid catalysts (In, Sc, Fe, BF3, Co, Pd, 
phosphoric acids, etc).
