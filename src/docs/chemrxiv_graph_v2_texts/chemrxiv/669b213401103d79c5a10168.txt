Circularly polarized (CP) organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) are optoelectronic devices that 
are capable of emitting left and rightCP light using organic CP luminescence (CPL) emitters 
under unpolarized excitations, making them highly valuable in applications such as 3D and 
highresolution displays,1 information encryption, 2 and spintronic devices.3 With the rapid 
conceptual advancement in the molecule design of CPL emitters, the performances of CP
OLEDs have made significant progress.4 Among all CPL molecules, multiple resonance (MR) 
organoboron chiral emitters have aroused particular attention owing to their unique alternative 
distribution of frontier molecular orbitals on single atoms, which can suppress vibronic 
couplings and minimize structural relaxation to generate high colorpurity narrowband 
emissions.5 Consequently, boronnitrogen (BN) embedded CPLMR emitters with axial 
chirality, central chirality, and planar chirality structures, etc have been developed, enabling the 
realization of highly efficient CPOLEDs with narrowband emission across the whole visible 
region.6 
Among the various manifestations of chirality, helical chirality is particularly notable.7 The 
highly twisted spiral structure ensures a stable molecular configuration, guaranteeing 
exceptional physical and chemical stability and also effectively suppresses the intermolecular 
 stacking in aggregate films.8 In 2022, Zhu et al.
