Description:
Identified using 13C CP and DEPT experiments in NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
Solutionstate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the goto spectroscopic 
techniques for structural determination of molecules since every spectral feature is a fingerprint 
of a structural motif. Usually, the workflow for structural determination of small molecules using 
this technique employs 1D 1H NMR and 1H1H COSY (Correlation Spectroscopy) to identify 
protons based on chemical shift, multiplicity, and Jcoupling. Further, 13C CP (CrossPolarization) 
and DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer, specially DEPT90 and 
DEPT135) experiments are used to identify carbon species. Finally, 1H13C HSQC (Heteronuclear 
Single Quantum Correlation) and HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Correlation) are 
acquired to assign carbon species attached to protons and the remaining carbons respectively.
