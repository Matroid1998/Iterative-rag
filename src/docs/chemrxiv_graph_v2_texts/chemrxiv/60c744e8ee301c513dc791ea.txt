Description:
A component of sulfur and nitrogen-containing porous polymers (SNPs) used in donor-acceptor interactions.

One further strategy to 
tune the optical bandgap of a conjugated polymer is the incorporation of heteroatomcontaining 
donoracceptor (DA) motifs into its backbone.1415 Recently, we have introduced a family of 
sulfur and nitrogencontaining porous polymers (SNPs) that make use of DA interactions 
between neighboring electrondeficient triazine (C3N3) cores and electronrich aryl thiophene 
building blocks of the polymer to achieve control over the bandgap energy without large changes 
to the pore structure.16 In addition, incorporation of aromatic spacers between the donor and the
