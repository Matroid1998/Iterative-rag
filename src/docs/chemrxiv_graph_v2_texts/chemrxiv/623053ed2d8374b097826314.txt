Description:
Have a virtual monopoly in the design of high performance single-molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their magnetic anisotropy and spin values.

The difficulties to push the boundaries of the per
formances due to the equilibrium between magnetic anisotropy 
and spin values associated to the discovery of the first mononu
clear lanthanide SMM,3 this led to a virtual monopoly for lan
thanide chemistry in the design of high performance SMMs.48 
The use of computational approaches to better understand the 
needed prerequisites helped to optimize such systems.910 Thus 
the strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy observed in organome
tallic lanthanide complexes allowed the observation of a high 
blocking temperature, up to 80 K.1114 Such molecular systems 
which display magnetic bistability could become good candi
dates to applications such as quantum computing15 and 
spintronics.16 With the aim to extend the range of potential ap
plications dedicated to SMMs, the reversible modification of 
the magnetic behavior by applying external stimuli opens the 
possibility to design switches and sensors.17 The switching of 
SMM behavior in lanthanide molecular systems is usually 
reached using i) chemical agents for redox reaction1821 and pH 
variation,2223 ii) selected solvents,2427 iii) light irradiation2831 or 
iv) a combination of several stimuli.3233 As recently reviewed,34 
lanthanides are ideal elements for the design of molecular 
switches since they are extremely sensitive to crystal field ef
fects, in other words, to any structural changes in the first coor
dination sphere or even farther in the crystal packing.
