Description:
In combination with 60Co radiolysis, it catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of monounsaturated fatty acids.

Structural analysis 
and mutational studies of the enzymes revealed that thiols play a 
crucial role in the reaction.12,13 As such, thiolbased molecules 
have been investigated as promoters of cistrans isomerization 
of unsaturated hydrocarbons.1422 However, none of them was 
genuinely catalytic conducive to practical applications (Table 
S1). Indeed, Chatgilialoglu and coworkers found that the com
bination of 2mercaptoethanol and 60Co radiolysis led to cata
lytic cistrans isomerization of monounsaturated fatty acids,18 
but the use of organic solvents may hinder efficient conversion. Adducts of thiols to double bonds by nucleophilic addition are 
frequently encountered as stable products, while the subsequent 
elimination of thiols following the pseudoEZ isomerization is 
impeded by both kinetics and thermodynamics.
