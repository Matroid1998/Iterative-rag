Description:
Amongst the most reactive and suitable Michael acceptors, allowing highly selective and efficient chemical modifications.

It has been successfully used to synthetize thermosets and 
hydrogels from biobased and biodegradable polymers, such as lignin 13, chitosan 14, or collagen 
15, mainly for biomedical applications 16. ThiolMichael addition takes place between a thiol, 
labelled as the Michael donor, and an activated double bond, labelled as the Michael acceptor. It is generally basecatalyzed but can also be nucleophilecatalyzed 17. The reaction is favored 
mainly by the electron deficiency of the Michael acceptor and the acidity of the Michael donor 
18. Accordingly, maleimides are amongst the most reactive and suitable Michael acceptors and 
allow highly selective and efficient chemical modifications when they are incorporated into the 
polymer structures 19.
