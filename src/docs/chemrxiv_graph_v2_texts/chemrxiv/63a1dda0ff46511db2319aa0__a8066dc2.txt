Description:
An electrode material studied for ionic transport in battery applications.

Forces acting on atoms
in a MD simulation is accessed from accurate (but expensive)
rst principles calculations, or inexpensive (and less accurate)
interatomic potentials (i.e., force elds). An alternative to MD is kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC, also
known as dynamic Monte Carlo)2224, which has been exten
sively applied to study materials kinetics including, recharge
able batteries2528, solidoxide fuel cells29,30, catalysis31,32,

crystal growth33, vacancy diffusion in alloys34,35, thin lm
growth36, and uid ow37. kMC is particularly useful in
quantifying ionic transport in battery materials, as demon
strated by van der Ven et al. in electrode materials, such as
LixCoO225, LixTiS238, Li1xTi2O439.
