In the early 21st century, environmental considerations have gained increasing importance, 
profoundly influencing economic progression and human sustainability. The implementation of 
international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement signifies a 
collective global commitment to diminishing carbon emissions, catalyzing a shift from 
traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This transformation is imperative in 
addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. The inherent intermittency of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, 
necessitates the integration of reliable electrochemical energy storage systems into future 
electrical grids. These systems are pivotal in managing this intermittency and ensuring a stable 
energy supply. The main energy storage technologies include leadacid, nickelcadmium (Ni
Cd), nickelmetal hydride (NiMH), lithiumion, and sodiumsulfur (NaS) batteries 1.
