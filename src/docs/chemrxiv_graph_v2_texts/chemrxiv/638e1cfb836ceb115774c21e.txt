Description:
Chiral organic molecules with large specific rotation influenced by molecular conformation and functionalization.

Text:
We have recently developed a scheme, referred to as Sia
analysis, whereby the OR is expressed as a sum of con
tributions from occupied i to virtual a molecular orbital
(MO) transitions.1 We can determine what physically is
driving optical activity and what parts of the molecule
are involved by analyzing the movement of charge density
described by these transitions. Using this framework, we
have investigated the influence of molecular conforma
tion and functionalization on the OR induced by chiral
organic molecules.7 More recently, we used this approach
to understand the origin of the large specific rotation in
helicenes, and how functionalization affects the optical
response.8 We found that the major contributions come
from transitions where density moves along the conju
gated  density.

Description:
Functionalization influences optical rotation in a complex manner, affected by substituent strength and helix length.

However, other transitions, which can
be described as the combination of two separate rota
tions of the orbital density along the twohalves of the

helix, tend to decrease the OR. Functionalization of the
helicenes influences the OR in a complex manner, where
the strength of the substituent groups and the length of
the helix may lead to cooperative or competitive effects
that are not easily predicted a priori, but can be inter
preted with our decomposition approach. As we showed
in Ref. 9, the method is robust, providing a consistent
physical interpretation of the OR in both modified veloc
ity gauge (MVG)10 and length gauge (LG) calculations,
regardless of the choice of perturbation used in solving
the linear response equations.
