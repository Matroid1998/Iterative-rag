Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to play a significant role in Parkinsons 
53 
disease pathogenesis. It can be induced by environmental toxins, particularly pesticides and 
54 
herbicides attack the central nervous system leading to the development of neurodegenerative 
55 
diseases (Carvey et al., 2006; Ruiperez et al., 2010). It is known that rotenone, a natural toxin 
56 
has been used tremendously as an insecticide or fish poison for the past 50150 years 
57 
(Giordano et al., 2012). Rotenone induces P.D. like symptoms in neurons by interrupting 
58 
ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) supply, by forming a complex with the membrane of the 
59 
Electron Transport Chain (Schuler et al., 2001). 60
