Description:
Metabolized using stable isotope tracers to study their metabolic pathways.

Text:
Stable isotope tracers have been widely used to study the metab
olism of carbohydrates, protein, lipids and metabolic cofactors.1 
Tracers can be used to determine the origins of specific metabolites 
by quantifying the incorporation of the isotope atoms from the la
beled substrates.24 Tracers can also be infused in vivo in a non
perturbative way to measure the turnover rates of circulating me
tabolites5,6. Another application of stable isotope tracing is meta
bolic flux analysis (MFA), which provides quantitative evaluation 
of the rates of biochemical reactions in the entire metabolic net
work.79 The most commonly used tracing isotopes are 13C, 2H and 
15N. 13C tracers are frequently used to study the biosynthesis of me
tabolites and quantify the carbon flow in the metabolic network10.
