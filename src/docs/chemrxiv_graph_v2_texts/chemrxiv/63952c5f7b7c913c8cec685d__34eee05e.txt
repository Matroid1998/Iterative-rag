Description:
Units involved in a threefold, partially intermolecular cycloaddition.

Text:
For example, Tilley et al reported a tribenzo, expanded 13helicene (A) 
through a threefold, partially intermolecular 222 cycloaddition with substrates 
containing three diyne units.4 Matsuda et al synthesized a expanded helicene that is the 
helically twisted analogue of kekulene (B) by using a 6fold ringclosing olefin metathesis 
reaction as a key step.6 Toyota et al developed a series of expanded helicenes consisting 
of up to five fused anthracene units (C) by PtCl2catalyzed cycloisomerization.7 However, 
the enantiomers of the abovementioned expanded helicenes could not be isolated by
