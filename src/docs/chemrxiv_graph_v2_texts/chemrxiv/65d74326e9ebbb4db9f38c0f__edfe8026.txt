Description:
Monomers used in conventional inks for two-photon laser 3D printing.

Inside 
of this voxel, the laser intensity is suciently high to start curing of the ink locally, what allows for the 
creaon of intricate 3D structures when scanning it within the ink. Convenonal inks for twophoton 
laser 3D prinng are composed of a mixture of (meth)acrylate monomers and crosslinkers, a 
photoiniang system as well as other addives.11,13,14 
Most of these components are usually derived from petrochemicals contribung to the rapid depleon 
of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
