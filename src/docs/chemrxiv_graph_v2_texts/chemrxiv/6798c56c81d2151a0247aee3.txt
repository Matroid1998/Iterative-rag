Description:
Chiral sp3 carbon atoms are associated with enhanced solubility and pharmacological properties.

Text:
Molecules embracing a high fraction of chiral sp3 carbon at
oms (Fsp3) feature an increased rate of clinical success ow
ing to their enhanced solubility, accessibility to more target 
space, and other pharmacological properties.16 As a conse
quence, enantioselective transition metalcatalyzed con
struction of Fsp3enriched molecules remained a dominant 
area of research in mainstream organic synthesis (Fig
ure 1A).715 Conceptually, the enantioselective construction 
of Fsp3enriched molecules generating multiple stereode
fined C(sp3)centers and quaternary chiral centers are 
among the most perplexing and fundamentally challenging 
formations in synthetic organic chemistry.710,16,17 Thus, as
sembling these moieties catalytically has been a cardinal 
objective for years.
