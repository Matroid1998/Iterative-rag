Description:
A secondary precipitate formed when Zn concentration is 2 wt and Ca concentration is 1 wt.

However, the alloying concentration of Zn and Ca 
along with the ZnCa atomic ratio influence significantly to the corrosion resistance and 
mechanical properties of the alloy system13,14. Based on previous reports, if the 
concentration of Zn  2 wt and concentration of Ca  1wt, extensive formation of 
secondary precipitates like Ca2Mg6Zn3 and Mg2Ca was observed1517. An ideal biomaterial 
should be devoid of any kind of secondary phases or precipitates18 to prevent the galvanic 
coupling between the precipitates and the Mg matrix19,20. Microalloying of Zn and Ca into Mg matrix in a trace amount (i.e., 1wt) could be an 
effective way to improve the mechanical properties with reduced secondary phases21.
