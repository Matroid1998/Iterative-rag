Description:
Atoms that, when adsorbed on metal surfaces, can lead to an anomalous decrease in the work function.

Batteries
based on anions such as chloride represent an alternative
to the widely used Liion batteries as they are typically
based on more abundant materials and also exhibit the
oretical energy densities which can be higher than those
of current lithium ion batteries 9, 10. Thus they con
tribute to more sustainable and environmentally friendly
energy storage technologies. Yet, the interaction of halides with metal surfaces is
also interesting from a surface science point of view. It
has been known for a long time that the adsorption of
halogen atoms on metal surfaces can lead to an anoma
lous decrease in the work function 1114.

Species that might form surface salts with metal surfaces.

Still, it is in
teresting from a fundamental as well as from an applied
point of view how the overall conversion of the metal an
ode on Clion batteries from a bulk metal to a chloride
salt proceeds. It is wellknown that metals can form socalled surface
oxides, i.e. thin adsorbed films with an oxidelike struc
ture, upon the exposure of metals to an oxygen atmo
sphere as a function of the oxygen concentration 21, 22. Hence the question arises whether metal surfaces upon
the exposure to halogen species might form equivalent
structure corresponding to a surface salt, i.e., thin films
with metalhalide like structures.
