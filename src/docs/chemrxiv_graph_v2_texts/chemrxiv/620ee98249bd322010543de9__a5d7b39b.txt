Description:
Older azobenzenes improved upon by newer sterically congested versions for better EZ isomerisation.

Several azobenzene substitution patterns have been developed to 
tune the isomers spectra, and thus the photoresponsiveness and 
completion of photoisomerisations.15 Tetraorthosubstitutions par
ticularly improve photoswitch performance, without necessarily 
compromising function (as most azobenzene photopharmaceuticals 
are azoextension or azolinker designs16 where only the 4,4 po
sitions determine bioactivity).1720 Hechts tetraorthofluoro pattern 
gives excellent EZ isomerisation at 500 nm and ZE at 400 nm.21 
Woolleys sterically congested tetraorthomethoxy,22 thioalkyl23, 
and chloro24 azobenzenes improved on older tetraorthoalkyl azo
benzenes,25,26 with still better EZ isomerisation at 550 nm (for good 
biocompatibility and depth penetration) making them alluring for 
photopharmacology in vivo;12 ZE isomerisation is most complete at 
400 nm (see Supporting Note 1).21,22 However, most tetraortho 
syntheses are inflexible, needing orthosubstituents to be introduced 
early and carried through synthesis;24,27 the only exhaustive latestage 
orthoderivatisation reported is tetraorthochlorination (Fig 1a).20
