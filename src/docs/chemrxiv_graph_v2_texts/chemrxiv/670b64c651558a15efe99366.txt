In the coming decades, achieving green energy and a circular economy will require humanity
to shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases. A crucial element in achieving this paradigm shift is the use of electrochemistry to convert
electrical energy into hydrogen and to convert hydrogen back into energy without direct
combustion in air. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a promising electro
chemical system for efficiently converting hydrogen into electricity, both in stationary appli
cations such as homes and buildings, and in mobility applications such as passengerowned
vehicles and heavyduty vehicles.13 Intensive research and development efforts have led to
remarkable improvements in efficiency and durability.
