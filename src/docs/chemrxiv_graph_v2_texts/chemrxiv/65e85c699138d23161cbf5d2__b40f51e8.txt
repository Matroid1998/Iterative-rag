Regulation via Fe doping lowers overpotentials for HER and OER under alkaline conditions.

Among them, the unique delectron configuration ren
ders transition metal sulfides promising candidates for al
kaline water electrolysis.2124,31,32 For example, hierarchical 
nanoassembled MoS2Co9S8Ni3S2Ni has been demon
strated as excellent toward overall water splitting, owing to 
the facilitated electron transfer properties induced by a 
strong interface interaction.31 Regulation of the local elec
tronic structure of Ni3S2 via Fe doping impressively lowers 
the overpotentials to trigger both the HER and OER under 
alkaline conditions.32 Indeed, engineering of structural de
ficiencies or regulation of crystal phases emerges as an ef
fective strategy to fabricate robust sulfidebased catalysts 
for effective alkaline electrolyzers.3337 Thus, a variety of 
transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been synthesized and 
examined for overall water splitting. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20242x795 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000292481109 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
