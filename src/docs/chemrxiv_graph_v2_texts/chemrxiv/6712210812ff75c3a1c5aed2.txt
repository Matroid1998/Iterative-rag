Description:
A greenhouse gas whose emissions contribute to climate change and is targeted for reduction through various capture technologies.

Text:
The continuous rise in global CO2 emissions has unfolded an era of unprecedented 
climate change with profound ecological and environmental consequences 1. Therefore, the urgency of mitigating the environmental impact of elevated CO2 levels 
raises a strong motivation to achieve largescale reduction of CO2 emissions 2. In 
this context, CO2 capture processes have received much attention 3,4. Considerable research has been dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of CO2 
capture technologies for largescale applications, particularly in natural gas 
purification and postcombustion processes 5. Various technologies are currently 
under investigation for the capture of CO2, including regenerative solventbased 
absorption 2,6, fixed bed adsorption 7, cryogenic separation techniques 8, and 
membrane separation methods 912.

Description:
A gas whose permeability and selectivity are key factors in membrane separation for efficient capture.

Text:
Of these, membrane technology offers 
advantages such as exceptional stability, high efficiency, low energy consumption, 
and ease of operation 5. However, a significant drawback of membrane separation 
is the inherent tradeoff between permeability (pressurenormalized flux) and 
selectivity (AB) for gases A and B, as described by the relationship in Eq. 1 5,12

Where PA is the steady state permeability of the more permeable gas A Barrer,  is 
the selectivity for gas A over gas B (PAPB), and k and n are gas pairspecific 
constants k is the prefactor Barrer, and n is the slope of the tradeoff relationship, 
which is typically negative. Extensive research efforts in the membrane separation 
field aim to improve CO2 permeability and selectivity to enhance the efficiency of CO2 
capture.
