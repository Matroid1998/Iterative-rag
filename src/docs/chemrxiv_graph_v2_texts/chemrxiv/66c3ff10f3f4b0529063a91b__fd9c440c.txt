Description:
Used for proximity mapping of T-cell protein environments and functionalization of aliphatic polymers.

Text:
Reagents developed on the 
trifluoromethyl aryl diazirine scaffold are also now frequently 
employed 
for 
proximity 
mapping 
of 
Tcell 
protein 
environments,6 and for the functionalization7 and crosslinking8
10 of lowfunctionality aliphatic polymers. Fig. 1 
Overview of diazirine reactivity and utility in chemical biology. A 
Photochemical or thermal activation of diazirine reagents reveals reactive 
carbenes that can engage in XH insertions to nearby substrate molecules. B 
Photoaffinity labelling of target proteins with diazirineenabled small molecules 
allows for identification of macromolecular binding partners.
