Description:
Exhibits a very wide anodic solvent window in water due to OER being disfavored and experiences minimal electrochemical corrosion.

The electrode materials which have shown most promise are 
synthetic boron doped diamond (BDD),1117 PbO2,18 TiO2,19 and NiSb doped SnO2.20 BDD is 
particularly interesting as it presents no heavy metal contamination issues, exhibits a very wide 
anodic solvent window in water due to OER being disfavored and experiences minimal 
electrochemical corrosion during operation, unlike materials such as PbO2 and doped SnO2.8 
To date, to the best of our knowledge, all studies which use BDD employ material 
grown using either hot filament or microwave chemical vapor deposition (CVD).21,22 The BDD 
is either grown in thin film form, where it remains attached to the growth substrate, or thick 
enough so that it can be removed and is freestanding.
