With the continuous advancements in technology, demand for efficient energy conversion and 
storage technologies, such as fuel cells and rechargeable batteries, is growing rapidly.1,2 Fuel cells 
and batteries are critical technologies in the shift away from polluting fossil fuel energy.3 The 
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a critical process in the operation of fuel cells and metalair 
batteries, with highly active but expensive platinum group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts typically 
used to drive sluggish 4electron ORR. The widespread commercialization of fuel cells is 
intimately linked to production costs, particularly those related to electrode materials.4,5 
Commercialization hinges on the discovery of costeffective, environmentally friendly, high
performance electrode materials.
