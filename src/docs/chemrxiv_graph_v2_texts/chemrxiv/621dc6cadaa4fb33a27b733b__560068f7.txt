Description:
A radical that can be activated by light to generate chlorine radicals.

Text:
On the other hand, we reported the CH oxygenation reaction of methane (CH4) through the light 
activation of chlorine dioxide radical (ClO2).8 In these oxidation reactions, the chlorine radical (Cl) 
generated from the ClO2 gas upon light activation cleaved the CH bond. The CH bond dissociation 
energy of CH4 is 104 kcal mol1, which was higher than that of CHCl3 (95.7 kcal mol1).9 These results 
prompted us to investigate the generation of COCl2 through the oxygenation of CHCl3 with ClO2
