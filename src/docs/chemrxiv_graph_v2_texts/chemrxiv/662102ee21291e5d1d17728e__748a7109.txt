Description:
A group 3 or 4 element that can lay between MXene layers.

Text:
Hence, the literature generally refers to 
the unit cell of Mn1XnT0 as pseudoP63mmc.14 

MXenes are fabricated from corresponding MAX phases with the chemical composition of Mn1AXn, where 
A is either group 3 or 4 elements (e.g., Al, Ga, Si) laying between the MXene layers.1518 MXenes have very 
diverse chemical compositions due to the different combinations of M, A, and X elements.
