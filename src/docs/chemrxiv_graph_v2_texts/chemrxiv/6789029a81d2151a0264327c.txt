Description:
A donor type ligand used in Zn2 based organic frameworks.

This 
is a consequence of the hydrolytic instability of the Zn4O clusters used as secondary building 
blocks.9,10 Compared to these two large classes of MOFs, Zn2based organic frameworks 
containing carboxylate and nitrogen donor type ligands in the structure have received less 
attention, probably because of the significantly increased structural diversity of this class of 
materials, which generally have low surface areas.11,12 Examples of Zn2 based MOFs built 
using of ditopic linkers containing a carboxylate and a nitrogen donor in the same molecule are 
more rare. This is probably because of the significantly higher synthetic effort required to 
prepare such linkers. Figure 1 shows the linkers combining an Ndonor and a carboxylate group 
in the same molecule used to prepare Zn2 organic frameworks.
