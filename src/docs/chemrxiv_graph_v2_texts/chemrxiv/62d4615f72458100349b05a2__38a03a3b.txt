Description:
Used as a photocatalyst for the oxidation of orthomethoxybenzyl alcohol.

Text:
This approach, however, does not take into 
account the photochemical behaviour of products of partial oxidation of aromatic alcohols that 
are produced during irradiation of the suspension of photocatalysts in the substrate solution. In 
2016, 
the 
Augugliaro 
group 
reported 
the 
photocatalytic 
effect 
of 
ortho
methoxybenzaldehyde, produced by oxidation of orthomethoxybenzyl alcohol over TiO2 
photocatalysts, on homogeneous photooxidation of other alcohols under UV light.19 
Surprisingly, this important finding that should have alarmed many researchers has been sadly 
neglected by the community, as this paper has received only few citations so far. Two years 
later, Pavan et al. addressed the question of benzyl alcohol selfoxidation under UVlight.20 
When irradiating benzyl alcohol solution in acetonitrile with UVA light, they observed that after 
a long induction time benzaldehyde was formed.

Description:
A photocatalyst that facilitates the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under irradiation.

Text:
The same experiments performed in the 
presence of a TiO2 photocatalyst showed that benzaldehyde was produced immediately upon 
starting irradiation; however, when the TiO2 photocatalysts was extracted after a certain time 
interval, the benzyl alcohol oxidation clearly proceeded further and the benzaldehyde 
concentration continued to grow. In other words, one can assume that the formed 
benzaldehyde initiated a photochemical reaction with benzyl alcohol leading to the oxidation 
of the latter according to the mechanism adapted from Bradshaw21, Heyes22 and Pavan20 and 
shown in Scheme 1.
