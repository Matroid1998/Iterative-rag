Description:
Used in the rearrangement of sulfonamide.

Text:
The reactions forming carbonsulfur bonds have received less attention, even though aryl 
thioethers are valuable synthetic intermediates frequently found in biologically and 
pharmaceutically active molecules. Indeed, several aromatic thioethers have shown potential 
clinical applications1. Page 2 of 11 

Past Work 
Among the numerous methods developed in the past decades, the most common and powerful 
approach are coupling of aniline with, thiol,2 Nthio Succinimide3, Chloro with thiol4, iodo with 
thiol5, reductive methods such as sulfinic acid,6 Tosylhdyrazine7 and disulfide8, thiol9 and 
rearrangement of sulfonamide in triflic acid10. Even though there are large reported methods 
for thioethers, there is always room for improvement and to find a novel and efficient method, 
especially were by using readily available, inexpensive, and easily handled reagent.
