Monitoring CO2 is imperative to understand its origin and impact. Both, the global climate crisis 
8 
and the current COVID19 pandemic have shifted attention and created awareness of the need in 
9 
comprehensive CO2 monitoring on local and global scales.1,2 To fight global warming, a deeper 
10 
awareness of the public for the impact of greenhouse gases like CO2 may be required.

Description:
A molecule that can be selectively captured or converted due to its binding sites.

Text:
Such NCs, 
27 
obtained from pyrolysis, are a class of materials, which has been proposed for selective CO2 
28 
capture or conversion as they intrinsically provide selective binding sites for CO2.1115 In 
29 
particular, polypyrrole or imidazolebased NCs demonstrate a remarkable CO2 sorption capacity 
30 
as well as excellent environmental stability and electrical conductivity.1618 Like CNMs, those 
31 
particulate NCs require additional processing steps to generate complex sensor architectures. 32
