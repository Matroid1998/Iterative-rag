Description:
Used in layered rock salt structures for lithium-ion cathodes with excellent mass-to-charge ratio.

The exploration and optimisation of novel chemistries
for lithiumion cathode materials remains a vast area of
research for the materials science community 15 ow
ing to the crucial role of electrochemical energy stor
age in transitioning to a low carbon economy. Dis
ordered rock salt lithiumion cathodes are an emerg
ing materials class in this area 69. These materi
als share the closepacked oxygen framework present
in most commercial lithiumion cathode materials such
as the layered rock salt cobalt and nickelrich struc
tures 10, 11 conferring an excellent masstocharge ra
tio and volumetric efficiency. While performant, layered
cobalt and nickel rich structures have poor longterm
technoeconomic prospects 12.
