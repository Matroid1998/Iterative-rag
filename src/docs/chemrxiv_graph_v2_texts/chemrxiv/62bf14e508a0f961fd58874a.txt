Description:
A compound used in batteries with a theoretical energy density among the highest for battery chemistries.

Text:
LiO2 batteries have been widely investigated due to their theoretical energy density being 
among the highest possible for different battery chemistries.1,2 However, parasitic reactions, poor 
cycling stability, and the insulating nature of their discharge productsmainly Li2O2have all 
proven to be large hurdles for the practical implementation and commercialization of these cells.3
8 Two primary pathways forming Li2O2 have been identified in conventional liquid aprotic 
electrolyte LiO2 cells. These are commonly referred to as surfacemediated and solutionmediated 
mechanisms.9 The former proceeds by sustained growth of a film on the cathode surface until a 
limiting thickness is reached.

Description:
A novel solid state electrolyte architecture that offers higher operating temperatures and avoids parasitic reactions found with organic electrolytes.

Text:
In the present contribution we investigate a novel solid state electrolyte (SSE)based 
architecture for LiO2 that could offer two significant benefits when compared to typical liquid 
electrolyte cells (i) access to much higher operating temperatures promotes depth of discharge 
through thermalenhancement of ionic and electronic conductivities of the discharge product, and 
(ii) the absence of carbonin either electrolyte or electrodecircumvents the parasitic reactions 
commonly found with organic electrolytes and graphitic electrodes. Additionally, because
