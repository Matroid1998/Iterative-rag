Of special interest are systems with components that respond to external stimuli.2023 Among the 
different external stimuli used to influence polymer system properties, light uniquely provides 
exact, realtime control over spatiotemporal distribution.24 One common use of light is to activate 
or demask photoresponsive protecting groups (PPGs).25 PPGs use a photochemically sensitive 
moiety to protect a functional group, enabling a light triggered approach to unveiling functional 
groups within organic polymers, molecular biology and bulk materials.25,26 Polymers with PPG 
are contributors to therapeutic delivery, offering precise control over the activation of prodrugs 
and the decomposition of nanoparticles.2729 Among PPGs, the 2nitrobenzyl moiety has received 
the most attention due to its potential to induce lightresponsive properties through either 
bioconjugation30, crosslinking3134, etc., to develop photoresponsive polymers.25,35
