Description:
A material used in carbon fibers, known for being lightweight, thermally stable, and having high stiffness and tensile strength.

Text:
Carbon fibers have a diameter of approximately 5 to 10 micrometers 1. The worldwide 
demand for carbon fibers has experienced remarkable growth, reaching approximately 150 
thousand metric tonnes in 2021, and is predicted to increase at 7.55 CAGR (Compound 
Annual Growth Rate) until 2035. The high CAGR of carbon fibers occurs because they are 
lightweight, thermally stable, and have high stiffness and high tensile strength. It has been 
used in several industries, such as wind, aerospace, automotive, civil, and pressure vessels 2. Currently, 90 of carbon fibers are based on polyacrylonitrile (PAN), while the remaining 
10 are pitchbased, precisely mesophase pitch. Both precursors are petroleumbased. These 
precursors contribute over 50 of the overall cost of production, making carbon fiber a 
luxury product 3.

Description:
An element that is a key component in carbon fibers.

To address this issue, researchers have started to work on various other 
precursors, such as polyethylene, lignin, and rayon. Table 1 compares the cost per kg of lignin 
with the total cost of PAN and pitch. The table shows that lignin is a more costeffective 
precursor than current carbon fiber precursors. Additionally, it is the only largevolume aromatic renewable feedstock with 60 to 65 carbon 
content, making it a potential precursor for carbon fibers 45. Lignin is mainly produced by 
paper and pulp industries, with a current annual production of 50 to 70 million metric tonnes 
worldwide, of which less than 2 are utilized to produce valueadded products such as 
formulations of dispersants, binders, and surfactants, and the remainder serve as combustor 
for heating and power generation 6.
