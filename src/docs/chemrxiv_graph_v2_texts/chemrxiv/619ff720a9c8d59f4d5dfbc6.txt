Description:
Examined in the context of high harmonic generation (HHG) using an atom-centered Gaussian representation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals.

These include abovethreshold ionization, nonsequential
ionization, multiphoton ionization, delayed photoemis
sion, and HHG.1113 Attosecond experiments are ex
pected to provide fundamental probes of electron correla
tion and ultrafast charge migration in both molecules and
materials.1316 Theoretical description of this emergent
physics promises to push the envelope of computational
quantum chemistry.17
In the context of timedependent density functional
theory (TDDFT),18,19 strongeld phenomena cannot
be described within the linearresponse approximation20
that has become essentially synonymous (in quantum
chemistry, at least) with the moniker of TDDFT.21 In
principle, an exact theory can still be formulated even
in the strongeld or nonperturbative regime, based
on direct solution of the timedependent KohnSham
equation.12,22 This approach is often called realtime
TDDFT,23 although we prefer the term timedependent
KohnSham (TDKS) theory.24,25 In practice, however,
there are signicant questions as to whether existing

exchangecorrelation functionals that invoke the adia
batic approximation are up to the task,12,23 although
improving the description of the derivative discontinu
ity improves the description of ionization, even within
the adiabatic approximation.26

Description:
Involved in high harmonic generation (HHG) simulations emphasizing the importance of using an exchange-correlation functional with correct asymptotic behavior.

Text:
Previous TDKS simulations of
HHG in H2 have emphasized the importance of using
an exchangecorrelation functional with correct asymp
totic behavior.2730 In some calculations, this has been
achieved in practice by using either timedependent
HartreeFock (TDHF) theory or else the closelyrelated
timedependent conguration interaction singles (TD
CIS) method.29,3133 Functionals with an explicit self
interaction correction have also been employed,27,28 as
this helps with the aforementioned derivative disconti
nuity.

Description:
A small molecule considered for simulation of high harmonic generation (HHG).

Text:
Recently, the use of rangeseparated, longrange
corrected (LRC) hybrid functionals3439 has been con
sidered for simulation of HHG in H2 and other small
molecules.33 As compared to either generalized gradi
ent approximations or even global hybrid functionals,
LRC functionals do a much better job of approximating
the derivative discontinuity.40 The simulations presented
herein will be based upon the LRCPBE functional,37
which was also used to simulate HHG in Ref. 33. Rather than using a gridbased algorithm to solve the
TDKS equations,22,27,28 we follow the path established
by Saalfrank, Luppi, and others,2933,41 using atom
centered Gaussian basis sets to represent the density.

Description:
A molecule for which both Gaussian and grid-based quantum chemistry representations are feasible.

Text:
This makes TDKS simulations accessible with widely
available, general purpose quantum chemistry codes, and
the compactness of the Gaussian representation oers
the possibility to extend TDKS calculations to larger
molecules than are feasible in gridbased representations. Even for H2, where both approaches are feasible, the
Gaussian representation is found to be at least an order
of magnitude more ecient,30 and only that approach
