Description:
An oxidizing agent used in the oxidation of organic compounds.

Due 
to its smell, the crude product (4) was used in the next oxidation 
reaction without further purification. Oxidation of the latter with 
mCPBA gave 51 mg of the needed product 2 in 26 yield after 
a column chromatographic separation. It became obvious to us, 
that a principally novel approach to pyrazole 2 was needed. We 
decided to challenge the preparation of a new reagent with the 
already installed MeSO2substituent that could be easily 
converted into the needed product. Figure 1. MeSO2substituent stateoftheart.
