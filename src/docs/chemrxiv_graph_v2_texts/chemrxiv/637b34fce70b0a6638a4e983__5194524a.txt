Description:
Contained in iodonium salt described by Lisichkina and Tolstaya.

Text:
Examples include the benzisoxazolecontaining iodonium salt 1 
described by Lisichkina and Tolstaya 1 (Figure 1).10 Our group is interested in the 
chemistry of hypervalent iodine species in all their variety, particularly those containing 
Nheterocycles either as tethered stabilizing ligands or as an inclusive part of a cyclic 
iodonium salt.1116 We prepared fivemembered, Nheterocyclecontaining iodoliums 
2 and investigated their reactivity and utility in XBcatalysis. We also established one
pot methods for generating sixmembered carbon, oxygen and nitrogenbridged 
iodonium salts, such as the iodazinium triflate 3.17,18 Based on these promising 
findings, we further want to elaborate this chemistry and herein present the first 
synthesis and application of more sophisticated imidazo and pyrazoloiodazinium salts. Figure 1 Nitrogencontaining iodolium and iodonium salts.
