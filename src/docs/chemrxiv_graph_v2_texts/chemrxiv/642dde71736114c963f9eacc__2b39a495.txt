Description:
A structural component of proton pump inhibitors, differing in substituent groups.

Text:
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a type of drugs that function on the cells by reducing the 
secretion of acid which is attached to the stomach. They act irreversibly by blocking the 
hydrogenpotassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the HK ATPase or, more 
commonly, the gastric proton pump) of the gastric parietal1,2 cells. They are substituted 
benzimidazoles which is applied for the remedy of acidrelated syndromes, including 
gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) and peptic sore disease. These are lipophilic weak bases 
which span the parietal cell membrane and enter the acidic parietal cell canaliculus3. They have a 
basic fundamental structure which differs only in the sort of substituents group located on the 
pyridine and benzimidazole4 rings.
