Description:
A polyvalent anion that is quite polarizable.

Text:
One of the earliest results of surfacesensitive vibrational sumfrequency generation
(VSFG) experiments 1,2 was the observation that soft anions impact the vibrational
lineshape in the OH stretching region, but that hard anions do not 36. The term soft
is chosen carefully here, as an alternative to polarizable, and can be roughly interpreted
as monovalent and polarizable, equivalent to having a low surface charge density 7. (Such ions are sometimes called chaotropic 8.) Although the surface activity of certain
anions is often discussed in terms of polarizability 917, it should be noted that polyvalent
anions such as SO2
4 (aq) are quite polarizable 18, however the presence of such ions in
solution does not affect the OH lineshape measure in VSFG experiments 19.
