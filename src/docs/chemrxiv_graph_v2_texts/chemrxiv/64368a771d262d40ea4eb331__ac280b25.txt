Such
trace impurities can play a significant role for
example in catalytic processes.6,19,20 Recently
it has been shown that NPG films can also
be prepared by anodization (Au oxide forma
tion at a Au anode set to a potential of a
few volts versus a fixed reference with cur
rent densities of approximately 0.035 Acm2)
and subsequent electrochemical reduction.21,22
Similarly, recently we have shown that NPG
films can be produced by (electro)chemically
reducing Au oxide films formed during high
voltage (HV) electrolysis and anodic contact
glow discharge electrolysis (aCGDE).

In this work,
we study the influence of
the crystallographic orientation of the sub
strate on the formation of the Au oxide dur
ing HV electrolysis and the structure of the
NPG film formed by electrochemical reduc
tion. Such aspects can be investigated by using
oriented singlecrystal electrodes, an approach
widely used in surface science and electrochem
istry. For example, the facetdependent ox
ide formation has been studied on noble met
als such as Pt,31 Au,32 and on nonnoble met
als such as Al,33,34 Ni,35 Fe,36 or Cu.37,38 Con
way and Jerkiewicz, for example, found that
oxide formation occurs at different rates on
the Pt(111) and the Pt(100) facets.31 Vve
