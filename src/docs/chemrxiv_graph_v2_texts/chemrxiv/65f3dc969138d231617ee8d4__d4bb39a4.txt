Description:
An organic layer used in conjunction with PbS quantum dots.

Text:
of an intermediate tripletdiffusing, FRETblocking organic layer between the 
PbS QDs and rubrene layers (see Figure 1e). We hypothesize that the introduction of 
some optimal thickness of an organic semiconductor would improve EQEs by reducing 
the BT process.

Description:
A compound with a triplet energy level of 1.14 eV and a singlet energy level of 2.25 eV.

Text:
This ideal interlayer would possess a triplet energy level between that of 
rubrene (T1  1.14 eV)78 and the PbS QD bandgap (1.2 eV) while possessing a singlet 
energy level higher than that of rubrene (S1  2.25 eV).78 As shown in Figure 1e, this 
proposed device architecture prevents the parasitic BT by acting as an uphill energetic 
barrier while maintaining the triplet energy flow to the rubrene through downhill energy 
transfer processes (ET1, ET2).65,67,74,75 
Here, we report the use of 5tetracene carboxylic acid (TCA, S1  2.4 eV, T1  1.3 eV, 
see Figure 1e)79 as an interlayer to improve NIRtovisible solidstate UC. In addition to 
improvements in BT alleviation (i.e., reduction in BT), we observe improvements in triplet 
extraction (ET1ET) efficiencies from PbS.
