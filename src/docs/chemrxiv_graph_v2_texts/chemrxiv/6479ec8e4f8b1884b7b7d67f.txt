Description:
Can terminate polymerization reactions if introduced into the system.

Text:
Even small
amounts of oxygen inadvertently introduced into the
system (e.g. by inadequate deoxygenation of a reactant,
or an air leak) will result into termination of the poly
merization reaction. Moreover, it means scaling up to
larger surfaces is difficult, since equally large airtight
glassware (to contain them) is required, and conversion
is extremely low; only a small fraction of monomer in
the solution is polymerized on the surface. 16, 17
Airtolerant polymerization methods greatly simplify
polymer brush synthesis 18, 19, 20, and make it
accessible to more people, as well as much more con
venient for experienced chemists.
