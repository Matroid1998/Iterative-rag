Description:
In C18, exhibits a special sp hybrid form with an unusual in-plane electron system in addition to the common out-of-plane system.

However, although 
cyclocarbon oxides are very special compounds with richcarbon features, maybe 
blinded by the pursuit of pure allcarboatomic rings, they have not received the 
attention they deserve. And yet we believe that, at least till now, studying the easily 
synthesized and relatively stable cyclocarbon oxides C18(CO)n (n  6, 4, and 2) 
should have more practical significance than investigating the very reactive and 
hardly attainable C18. Our previous theoretical studies on allcarboatomic C18 showed that, due to the 
special sphybrid form of its carbon atoms, the molecule exhibits an unusual inplane 
 electron system (in) in addition to the outofplane  system (out) that are common
