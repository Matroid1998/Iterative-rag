Description:
Involved in atom abstractions that are thermodynamically possible in radical chemistry.

Text:
The radical chemistry of proteins is of fundamental importance
in biochemistry. Radicals are involved in many enzymatic reac
tions. Also, oxidative damage to proteins is generally initiated
by radicals. For both, knowledge of reliable XH bond dissoci
ation energies (BDEs, X  C, N, O, S) for amino acids in pro
teins is important. XH BDEs allow to predict which hydrogen
atom abstractions will be thermodynamically possible, and which
lesion sites can be repaired by cellular antioxidants. Preferred
sites of radical attack and hydrogen atom abstraction are those
associated with the lowest energy barriers, and, according to the
BellEvansPolanyi principle,1,2 these reactions are typically the
most exothermic.
