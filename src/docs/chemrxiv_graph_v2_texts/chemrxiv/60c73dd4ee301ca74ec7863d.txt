Graphene is a twodimensional material made of a monolayer of sp2hybridised carbon atoms 
organised as a hexagonal lattice 1,2. The discovery of some of its properties in 2004 represented an 
unprecedented breakthrough in fundamental physics, which was recognised with the attribution of the 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 3. The enthusiasm generated by its unique combination of structural, 
mechanical, optical and electronic properties has quickly spread across a variety of scientific 
disciplines including physics, chemistry, material sciences and more recently biomedical sciences

Description:
A single-layer material derived from the exfoliation of graphite.

Text:
As a result, a variety of scalable production methods have been developed to overcome the low 
throughput of the original micromechanical exfoliation of graphite layers down to singlelayer 
graphene, including chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in low 
surface energy solvents 2. Such a variety led to the rise of a whole family of graphenebased 2D 
materials (GBMs), exhibiting various structural and physicochemical properties 5,6.
