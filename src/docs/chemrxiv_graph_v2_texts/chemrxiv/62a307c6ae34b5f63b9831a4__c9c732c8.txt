Description:
Complexes prepared from gold(III) precursors and characterized with gasphase ion spectroscopy.

Text:
We prepared the gold(II) complexes from their 
gold(III) precursors and explored how various common ligands 
stabilize the unusual oxidation state. We have characterized the 
prepared gold(II) complexes with gasphase ion spectroscopy. Benchmarked to the experiment, we have also investigated their 
structure and spectroscopic properties by DFT calculations.
