Description:
Photosynthetic cofactor in photosystems I and II with nearly C2 symmetric spatial arrangement.

Text:
Reaction centers (RCs) of photosystems I and II (commonly referred to as PSI and PSII)
share many structural similarities 1, 2. They both are formed by two protein subunits
and associated photosynthetic cofactors. The latter have nearlyC2 symmetric spacial
arrangements and, in the case of PSII, include (but are not limited to) the pairs of i) inner
chlorophyll a (Chl a) cofactors, ii) accessory Chl a pigments, iii) pheophytin a (Phe a)
molecules, and iv) plastoquinones. The rst three pairs are labeled as PDn, ChlDn, and
PheDn, where Dn is the protein subunit they belong to, i.e., D1 or D2. The plastoquinones
are often denoted as QA and QB.
