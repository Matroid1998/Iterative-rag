Description:
Formed from the oxidation of SO3 and exerts a harmful effect on the environment and infrastructure.

Text:
Typical concentrations of SO2 in the atmosphere range
from tens to hundreds of ppt in uninhabited regions, through tens of ppb
in cities, up to hundreds of ppb in industrial areas 7, 8. SO2 released
into the atmosphere is solubilized in water and slowly oxidized by oxy
gen, ozone, or Criegee intermediates to SO3, which subsequently leads
to the formation of sulfuric acid 9, 10. Consequently, precipitations
in the form of rain, snow, fog, or hail containing sulfuric acid fall to the
ground, exerting a harmful effect on the environment and infrastructure
1113. SO2 absorbed through the respiratory system or skin can be
a threat to human health or even life.
