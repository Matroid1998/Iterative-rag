Description:
An oil used to prepare ester oil-based nanofluids.

Text:
The ester oilbased nanofluids 
89 
were prepared by mixing palm fatty acid ester (PFAE) oil with three types of nanoparticles 
90 
(conducting Fe3O4, semiconducting TiO2 and insulating Al2O3) of size,1520 nm at a 
91 
concentration of 0.01 gL The ferrofluid was the best to show a 43  improvement in AC BDV. 92 
Similarly, Wenxia Sima et al. 14 studied the relative performances of conducting Fe3O4, 
93 
semiconducting TiO2, and insulating Al2O3 nanoparticles with size,10 ( 0.1) nm, modified by 
94 
Oleic acid, Stearic acid and Span 80 in TO. Due to the differences in the conductivity and the 
95 
dielectric constant, the rate of electron scavenging at the interface was found to be different for 
96 
different material. This led to different degree of improvement in impulse BDV.
