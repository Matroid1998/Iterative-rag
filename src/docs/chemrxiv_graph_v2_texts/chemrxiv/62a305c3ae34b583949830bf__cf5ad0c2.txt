Description:
The BiX bond undergoes homolysis that is mainly irreversible due to the high reactivity of the ensuing Bi radical species.

1C).18 Examples of Bi REC are scarce, 
and the few reported homolysis cases of the BiX bond are 
mainly irreversible, due to the high reactivity of the ensuing Bi 
radical species.19 Fundamental studies on a BiMo catalyst for 
the SOHIO process conducted by Hanna suggested that Bi(II) 
intermediatesformed after thermal homolysis of the Bi(III) 
bearing bulky phenolatescould be responsible for the for
mation of allyl radicals from propene.19c Similar reactivity with 
bulky phenolate anions was later observed by Evans in a unique 
CH bismuthylation of phenols.19a In 2018, Coles demonstrated 
that the Bi(III)O bond in a R2BiOTEMP compound is in equi
librium with the corresponding R2Bi(II) and TEMPO.20 Col
lectively, these precedents pointed to a facile thermal BiO 
bond scission of bulky oxytype anions that can stabilize O cen
tered radicals.19d, g Yet, the origin and factors that influence this 
process still remain unclear and investigations on such unusual 
chemical properties would be desirable.
