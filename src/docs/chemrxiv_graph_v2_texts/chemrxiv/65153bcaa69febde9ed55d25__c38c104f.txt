Description:
A binary compound with potential ultrahigh-density superhard polymorphs.

Text:
In this regard, the aim of the present work was to search for ultrahighdensity superhard polymorphs of 
the binary compounds BN and SiC with quartz topology based on qtz C6 9 by quantum mechanical 
calculations of crystal structures and physical properties in the framework of Density Functional 
Theory (DFT) 11,12.
