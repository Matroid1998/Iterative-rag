Description:
Requires development of methodologies for site-selective and substrate-oriented synthesis of unsymmetrical frameworks.

Text:
Considerable efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of diarylmethanes and diarylketones using 
methods such as FriedelCraftstype reactions, Grignardtype reactions, and transition metalcatalyzed 
crosscoupling reactions, including SuzukiMiyaura, Negishi, Kumada, and Fukuyama couplings (see 
Figure 1). While these elegant methods play a pivotal role in chemical transformations, they are often 
limited by challenges such as regioselectivity, air and moisture sensitivity, and the use of excess 
amounts of reagents which associated with the use of additives. Additionally, these reactions are 
frequently incompatible with unprotected functional groups. Although several promising stateoftheart approaches have been introduced, there remains a need 
for the development of a simple, complementary, and comprehensive methodology for the site
selective and substrateoriented synthesis of unsymmetrical diarylmethane and diarylketone 
frameworks.

Description:
A type of diarylated compound used in bioactive compound synthesis.

Text:
As part of our overarching strategies to synthesize a diverse range of diarylatedbased bioactive 
compounds (18, Figure 1B), encompassing diarylmethane and diarylketone derivatives, we identified 
organophosphonium salts (i.e., 11) as versatile core scaffolds for these molecules (Figure 1).1, 2 
Organophosphonium salts, characterized by the presence of CP moieties, particularly 
organophosphorusbased Wittig salts, are among the most widely utilized reagents in organic synthesis 
for constructing CC double bonds.1, 2 In recent years, innovative methods for functionalizing the C
P bond have emerged, employing organophosphonium compounds in novel ways to enable the 
formation of new chemical bonds such as CO, CN, CS, and CC bonds.2 These advancements
