Description:
A component of pentapeptide sequences that can vary except for proline.

Text:
ELPs constitute a particularly nice model system as they
can be expressed by bacteria in a strictly monodisperse fash
ion with different repeating sequences.1518 It is possible, for
instance, to synthesize pentapeptide sequences of the generic
form (VPGXG)n, where X stays for any amino acid except
proline.19,20 One can thus easily modulate the hydrophilic,
hydrophobic, and charged character of the ELPs20 together
with their LCST.18,21 Saltspecific effects were studied not only
for few neutral ELPs (e.g., V120),17,22,23 but also for the
weakly positively charged KV6120,8,24 and the weakly nega
tively charged DV2F64.9
For completely neutral polymers, e.g., pure PNIPAM or neu
tral ELPs, only two regimes of salt action were reported in the
literature,17,25 see Figure 1 (a).
