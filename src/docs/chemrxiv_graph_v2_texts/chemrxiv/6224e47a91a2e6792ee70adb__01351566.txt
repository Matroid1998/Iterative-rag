Description:
Involved in photosensitization as a reactant in nonradiative bimolecular energy transfer reactions.

While photosensitization has been the sub
ject of several theoretical studies 1017, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the process is
still lacking. Our aim, in this study, is to better understand photosensitization, using thiothymines
as the photosensitizers, since all three thiothymines (shown in Fig. 1)  2thiothymine (2tThy),
4thiothymine (4tThy) and 2,4dithiothymine (dtThy)  are known to have signicant singlet oxy
gen yields 18. Moreover, the thiothymines are known to have ultrafast intersystem crossing
(ISC) lifetimes 18 and near unity triplet yields with long long triplet lifetimes, of the order of
microseconds 19, 20, making them excellent photosensitizers. Specically, we wish to calculate
the rate constant at which they photosensitize O2, and thereby obtain physical and mechanistic
insights into photosensitization. Generally, photosensitization is a nonradiative bimolecular energy transfer reaction (Eq.
