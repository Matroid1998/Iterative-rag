Description:
A chiral ligand used in the preparation of chiral perovskites.

of a chiral ligand in lowdimensional 
MHPs. This approach, coupled with their rich structural tunability, made the preparation of 2D, 1D, 
and 0D chiral MHPs possible. Most of the chiral perovskites reported so far are based on the few available chiral ligands on the 
market such as methylbenzylammonium (MBA),  methylphenethylammonium (MPEA), 1
(naphthyl)ethylammonium (NEA), R3 aminopiperidine (3APD), 3ammonioquinuclidinium (3AQ), 
and 2 octylamine (2OA).518 In terms of structural motifs, 2D chiral perovskites are those most 
commonly reported together with 1D systems, while 3D systems have been predicted but not yet 
realized.16,19 This directly correlates to the fact that a chiral center requires organic ligands that are 
too big to be accommodated into a 3D lattice of interconnected octahedra but are easily inserted in 
layered systems.

Description:
Part of the (RSMBA)2SnI4 chiral perovskite system.

Text:
Tin replacement for lead in MHPs is a pervasive strategy not only to provide less toxic materials 
but also to reduce the band gap towards the optimum according to the ShockleyQueisser limit.26,27 
In addition, tinbased perovskites have similar or superior electronic and optical properties to lead
containing systems, such as higher charge carrier mobilities and longlived hot carriers.28 In the field 
of chiral perovskites, except for the (RSMBA)2SnI4 system (MBA methylbenzylammonium), no 
other tinbased materials have been reported so far. However, in view of potential future applications 
in chiral optoelectronic devices, the use of tin could guarantee a reduced environmental impact and 
provide the degree of optical properties tunability required.
