Description:
Used as a layer in TEM grids.

Text:
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful analytical tool for 
characterizing nanomaterials at the atomic level.13 TEM can also be used in combination with 
other TEM related techniques such as diffraction, to solve crystal structures, and electron 
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), to determine bonding and oxidation states.4 For the imaging 
of nanomaterials, a TEM grid coated with a continuous or partial thin film of an electron beam 
transparent material is often used. Thin films (3  30 nm) of carbon floated over a support 
substrate are particularly popular due to carbon being low electron scattering and electronically 
conductive. Here the carbon is typically an amorphous carbon film, although graphene oxide5 
and graphene6 layers have also been used.
