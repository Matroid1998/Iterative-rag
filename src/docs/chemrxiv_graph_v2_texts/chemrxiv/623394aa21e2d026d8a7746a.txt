Description:
Used at high pressures (34 atm) in Mn(I) catalyzed hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene.

Text:
Dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl complexes with bridging hy
drides have been known since the 1960s,17 and some of these 
react with alkynes leading to insertion products510 and one 
example is catalytic.11 In fact, to our knowledge, the first 
Mn(I) catalyzed hydrogenation used Mn2(CO)8(H)(
PPh2) (1), and it was an Eselective alkyne semi
hydrogenation (ESASH) reaction.11 This work has gone un
noticed in the context of Mn(I) (de)hydrogenative catalysis,12 
but this oversight is perhaps warranted since the catalysis was 
limited to diphenylacetylene (dpa) with low conversion (50) 
and Eselectivity (EZ  4) at high pressures of H2 (34 atm).
