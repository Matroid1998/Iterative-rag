Description:
Comprise eukaryotic membranes and typically bear two acyl tails.

Text:
The glycerolipids that comprise eukaryotic membranes all bear two acyl tails, with two 
notable exceptions. One is the fourtailed lipid cardiolipin (and its immediate metabolic precursors 
and products), a pseudodimeric phospholipid that plays several critical roles in the inner 
mitochondrial membrane.1 The other is a poorly understood triply acylated phospholipid, N
acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). First identified in 1965 as a minor component of wheat 
flour2, NAPE remained obscure until it was found to accumulate upon myocardial infarction and 
ischemia in mammals36, stimulating interest in its biosynthesis and metabolism.
