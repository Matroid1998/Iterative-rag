Description:
Bioisosteres that often demonstrate improved solubility, metabolic stability, and binding specificity over benzene analogues.

Substituted benzene rings are ubiquitous architectures present 
in biologically active molecules.1 However, recent trends in 
medicinal 
chemistry 
have 
highlighted 
the 
need 
to Escape from Flatland,2 by substituting planar aromatic 
rings with alternative scaffolds bearing higher degrees of 
saturation and accordingly, greater threedimensionality.3 
Bicyclo1.1.1pentanes (BCPs) have risen to prominence as 
suitable bioisosteres (Figure 1A), often demonstrating 
improved solubility, metabolic stability and binding 
specificity over their benzene analogues.4 

The most heavily utilized strategies to access BCP 
fragments5 originate with the highly strained hydrocarbon 
1.1.1propellane.6 Ringopening of 1.1.1propellane via 
radical or polar pathways can afford valuable bridgehead 
substituted BCPs.7 Despite the myriad ways in which this 
can be accomplished, such strategies suffer from the socalled 
propellane 
problem.5 
Specifically, 
the 
use 
of 
1.1.1propellane is associated with several practical 
downsides, namely cost, use of harsh reaction conditions, 
relative instability of the parent hydrocarbon and operational 
difficulty associated with handling the volatile compound in 
solution.5 These factors limit the practical utility of 
propellanebased methods and warrant investigation of 
distinct routes to BCP scaffolds,8 with a particular focus on 
methodologies amenable to industrial scale applications, a 
prerequisite for the use of BCP in therapeutic development 
programs.
