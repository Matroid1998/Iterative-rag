However, since Kempfs initial observations in 1905 of 

S2O82  C2O42  2 SO42  2 CO2 G0  490 kJmol (1) 

aqueous solutions containing S2O82 and C2O42, several reports have demonstrated that the 
reaction, despite being thermodynamically very favored, is extremely slow in the absence of a 
catalyst or thermal activation.13 Reports of Ag catalyzed reduction of S2O82 in the presence of 
reducing agents (e.g., Cr3, VO2, Mn2, Ce3, hydrazine, or ammonia) indicated that a strong 
oxidant is formed during S2O82 reduction.49 In addition, Ag catalyzed S2O82 reduction in the 
presence of C2O42 was reported to result in the complete oxidation of C2O42 at rates 23 orders 
of magnitude higher than systems containing the previously mentioned reducing agents.2, 3, 9 As 
first proposed by Allen, these findings suggest that Ag catalyzed S2O82 reduction in the presence 
of C2O42 initiates an autocatalytic reaction generating the strong transient oxidant, SO4 (E0(SO4
SO42)  2.24 V vs AgAgCl), which is capable of oxidizing C2O42 (eq 2) to produce CO2 
(E0(CO2CO2)  2.17 V vs AgAgCl), a strong reductant capable of reducing S2O82 (eq 3).3, 10

The large negative free energies associated with eqs 2 and 3 suggest that, once either SO4 or 
CO2 is generated in solution, the reaction between S2O82 and C2O42 (eq 1) should become self
sustaining, as shown by the red arrows connecting eqs 2 and 3.
