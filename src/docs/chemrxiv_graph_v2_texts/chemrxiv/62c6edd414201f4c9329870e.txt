Description:
A first-choice drug against malaria and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Text:
Chloroquine (CQ) is a firstchoice drug against malaria and 
autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and 
rheumatoid arthritis.1 It has recently been used for the 
emergency treatment of COVID19.2 In parasite digestive 
vacuoles, the pH is approximately 5.2.3 At this pH, the 4
aminoquinoline moiety is protonated (doubly positively 
charged) and undergoes trapping in these lysosomerelated 
acidic 
organelles.4,5 
The 
lysosomal 
targeting 
(lysosomotropism) of CQ is not only responsible of its 
antimalarial 
properties;6 
indeed, 
the 
endosomal 
alkalinization can lead to inhibition of viral replication and 
infection.7 Furthermore, the accumulation of CQ in acidic 
organelles can lead to the dysfunction of several enzymes 
required for proteolytic processing and posttranslational 
modification of viral proteins.8 
CQ has also been proposed to act as a zinc ion ionophore, 
i.e.
