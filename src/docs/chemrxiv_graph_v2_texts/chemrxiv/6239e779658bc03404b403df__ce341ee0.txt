Description:
Used in conjugate hydrocyanation of cyanoacrylates.

Text:
2Methylphenyl ringsubstituted phenylcyanoacrylate was reported in cyclopropanation of 
electrondeficient alkenes with 2bromo1,3propanedione compounds 1; in synthesis of 
ethyl 3amino1aryl1Hbenzofchromene2carboxylates in aqueous media 2; in 
conjugate hydrocyanation of cyanoacrylates using potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) 3; 
synthesis of novel 3,4dihydrophthalazin2(1H)yl4phenyl4Hpyrans 4; in diastereo 
and enantioselective synthesis of ,disubstituted bisalkoxycarbonyl sulfonates 5; in 
synthesis and study of binding affinities of methylvesamicol analogs for the acetylcholine 
transporter and sigma receptor 6. 4Phenoxy ringsubstituted phenylcyanoacrylate was 
involved in DBUmediated 4  2 annulations of cyclopropanes with 3aryl2
cyanoacrylates for the synthesis of fully substituted anilines 7, and in studies on quinolin
2(1H)one derivatives related to synthetic access to pyrano3,2c quinoline and 3
substituted quinoline derivatives 8. 4Methyl1,1biphenyl4ylsubstituted 
phenylcyanoacrylate was reported in synthesis of biaryl derivatives by sequential strategies 
via Suzuki couplingKnoevenagel condensation 9, 10.
