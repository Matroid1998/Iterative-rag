Description:
Involved in the oxidation process at the C1 and C4 positions in the glycosidic bond catalyzed by LPMOs.

Text:
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs; also designated PMOs) are copper 
metalloenzymes that perform unique redox chemistry resulting in disruption of polysaccharide chains by 
oxygen atom insertion at the glycosidic bond.1 The LPMO active site contains a mononuclear Cu2 center 
within a histidine brace motif in which the copper is coordinated by the Nterminal histidine amino 
group, the Nd atom of His1 and the Ne atom of a second conserved histidine.2 Of particular commercial 
and biotechnological interest is the ability of fungal LPMOs to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of 
recalcitrant crystalline cellulose at the C1 andor C4 position, thereby enhancing polysaccharide 
depolymerization by increasing glucan access to hydrolytic enzymes via the overall reaction shown in 
Scheme 1.35
