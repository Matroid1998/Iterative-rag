Description:
Exhibits intense free carrier absorption from the near to mid-infrared.

Text:
The extensively studied MXene Ti3C2Tx exhibits intense freecarrier absorption from the near
to midinfrared (IR) (15). Notably, a distinct nearIR absorption peak at around 800 nm (1.5
eV) has been widely reported for Ti3C2Tx (13,16). However, the assignment of this absorption
peak is still under debate. Two possible origins have been proposed interband transition (IBT)
or localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) (13,17). Densityfunctional theory (DFT) cal
culations demonstrated that this peak is an optically active IBT (18,19), which can vary with the
surface termination type. This was indirectly corroborated by our previous work (16), which
showed that this peak lacked strong anisotropic properties, typically seen in anisotropic plas
monic nanomaterials (2022).
