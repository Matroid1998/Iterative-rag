Description:
A component that increases the length of narrow interconnecting channels in porous structures.

Notably, the CO2 uptake for PUNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP is significantly 
higher than that of PUNCCocbipyCo, which is consistent with the increase in ultramicroporosity 
due to the included TPP increasing the length of the narrow interconnecting channels from 9  to 
15 , as measured from the scXRD structure. The resulting permanently porous PUNCvTPPCo
cbipyCovTPP possesses metalfree porphyrins suitable for metal cation incorporation via post
synthetic modification. Hence the crystals were exposed to a methanol solution of CuCl2 and the 
successful insitu incorporation of Cu2 to give PNCvTPPCuCocbipyCovTPPCu was confirmed 
by scXRD, which showed that the resulting CuCo distance is only 3.51 . Similarly, Co2 could be 
introduced into the TPP by exposure to a solution of CoCl2 to produce PNCvH2OCoTPPCocbipy
CovTPPCoOH2 with a CoCo distance of 3.52 .
