Description:
Type of material suited for use in MOFonMOF structures with porphyrin ligands.

Text:
This information however is not only crucial for understanding of 
MOFs function as optical sensor materials, but also as photocatalytic materials,7 photosensitizers for 
photodynamic therapy8 and in bioremediation applications.9 We prepared coreshell MOFs (often 
referred to as MOFonMOF materials) with isostructural elements that utilize organic linkers with 
significantly different photophysical properties10 and studied their different emission spectra and 
oxygen quenching behavior. PCN224 type materials are supposedly well suited for this endeavor since 
differently metalated and free porphyrin ligands crystallize in the same space group with the same 
lattice constants.1,2 
Results and Discussion 
The coreshell MOFs were prepared by a twostep procedure using 5,10,15,20tetrakis(4
carboxyphenyl)21,23Hporphyrin (H2TCPP) and its Pt(II) complex (Pt(II)TCPP) as the ligands. First, the 
core was synthesized by the conventional solvothermal reaction.
