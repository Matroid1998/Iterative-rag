Description:
Ligands that can cap nanoplates, causing lattice contraction.

of surface compressive stresses and can even remove atoms from 
the material.42 These surface effects impact not only the primary surface atoms, but cause 
distortions propagating inwards two to four atomic layers (Figure 4).42 To probe this effect, we 
collected selected area electron diffraction (SAED) data of undeformed single nanoplates before 
and after ligand exchange (Figure 4b, Table S4). Since surface atoms make up a nonnegligible 
percentage of thin nanoplates (10), lattice measurements from electron diffraction patterns for 
an entire particle should show deviations from the expected value if large surface reorganizations 
exist. Correlated lattice measurements were obtained for nine individual nanoplates capped first 
with carboxylate ligands (black) and then exchanged to thiol ligands (red, Figure 4b). On average, 
carboxylatecapped nanoplates exhibited a lattice contraction of 6.7.
