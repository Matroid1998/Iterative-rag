Cyclo18carbon (C18), an allcarboatomic molecule formed by 18 sphybridized 
carbon atoms connected in turn, has been widely concerned by many fields such as 
physics, chemistry, and materials science since it was structurally characterized twice 
by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the 
condensed phase in 2019 and 2020, respectively.135 By using atom manipulation on 
bilayer NaCl on Cu(111) at 5 K, the C18 molecule was produced for the first time by 
eliminating carbon monoxides from a cyclocarbon oxide molecule C18(CO)6 in one or 
more steps,1 while the latter was realized by dehalogenation of a bromocyclocarbon 
precursor, C18Br6.2 
The reaction precursors for preparing C18, C18(CO)n (n  6, 4, and 2) and C18Br6, in 
the two pioneering experiments are all planar ring structures with high symmetry, and 
belong to the category of carbonrich molecules in nature.

Description:
Forms a C18 ring that exhibits double aromaticity in its ground state.

Text:
Baryshnikov and coworkers 
demonstrated that diatropic ring current in groundstate C18 comes from the two 
scaffolds of 18 electrons oriented in and out of molecular plane, respectively, 
proving the idea of double aromaticity for the carbon ring.3 Charistos and 
MuozCastro reached the same conclusion by analyzing the contribution of the 
induced magnetic field from outofplane molecular orbitals (abbreviated as 
outMOs) and inplane  MOs (abbreviated as inMOs) of some C4n2 ring.4 The 
work reported by Dai et al. revealed that C18 is antiaromatic at its lowest excited state 
T1.5 Recently, we have extensively studied various properties and potential
