Description:
Chains that facilitate the formation of dimeric compounds in siliconsubstituted phthalocyanines.

Text:
Phthalocyanines, macrocyclic compounds composed of 
an aromatic carbon ring system interlaced with nitrogen,1 
can be chelated by a metal or metalloid and are utilized as 
an industrial dye, in solar energy applications, and cancer 
treatments.2,3 
Siliconsubstituted phthalocyanines can form dimeric 
compounds through siloxane chains (Figure 1). When ex
amined through Xray crystallography, observed torsional 
ringtoring rotation angles of approximately 15 and 40 de
grees run counter to expected confirmations, potentially 
implying the presence of an unknown intramolecular force, 
these forces have been dubbed long, directional interac
tions (LDIs).4 To date, structural data has been gathered on 
twenty such uniquely functionalized dimers, with further 
investigations into this phenomenon requiring new func
tional groups to be selected and utilized in the generation of 
dimeric phthalocyanines.
