Description:
Exhibit high selectivity for CO2 but have high thermal energy requirements for regeneration and limited lifetime due to oxygen sensitivity.

Text:
They tend to have relatively low CO2N2 selectivity, and frequently show high sensitivity to moisture in the gas 
mixture.11,12 Solidsorbents with grafted amines have also been reported. They exhibit high selectivity for CO2, but have high 
thermal energy requirements for regeneration, and limited lifetime due to the oxygensensitivity of amines.13,14 
Electrochemical CO2 capture techniques have gained considerable attention in recent years.5,7,15,16 They avoid the energy 
penalty associated with thermal and pressure cycling.

Description:
Redox-active compounds that tend to be oxygen-sensitive.

quinones, redoxactive amines).15,20,21 Redoxtechniques tend to have a more limited cyclelife, and frequently 
involve high cost materials such as carbon nanotubebased electrodes, redoxactive specialty polymers, copper, special 
amines, and ionic liquids. Quinones and amines tend to be oxygensensitive. Electrochemical methods based on pHswings, 
e.g. membranecapacitive deionization (MCDI),22 electrolysis,23 and bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED),24 have also 
been reported. However, MCDI require expensive materials such as cation and anionexchange membranes. Electrolysis and 
BPMED capture methods also require cation and anion exchange membranes and have high energy consumption (300 
kJ.mol1).5,15
