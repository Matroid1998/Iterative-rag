Halide perovskites (HPs) are now leading materials pioneering photovoltaic (PV) 
technologies, owing to their simple solution processibility and excellent optoelectronic 
functionality. Among them, inorganic Csbased HPs, where volatile methylammonium 
is excluded, are anticipated to be advantageous to thermal stability. Also, it offers a 
relatively wide bandgap of 1.71.8 eV that is desired for front cell in tandem PV 
applications14, while excluding substantial bromine incorporation that compromises 
bandgap stability via halide segregation5, 6. However, thermodynamically, the 
synthesis of photoactive CsPbI3 phase requires high temperatures over 325 oC7, 8. Such high temperature is incompatible with the organicbased holetransport materials 
(HTMs), thereby realizing pin type PVs  chemically more stable and a conventional 
architecture for tandem PV application  difficult.
