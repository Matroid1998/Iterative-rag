Description:
Known as the main factor for the greenhouse effect.

Text:
In recent decades, carbon dioxide (CO2) have become a serious threat in environment inspect, which was known as 
the main factor for the greenhouse effect. However, conventional methods of the utilization of CO2, for example, 
decreasing the CO2 level in the atmosphere through using chemical synthesis to produce functional chemicals or 
fuels concurrently.1 Traditionally, the eective routes to harvest CO2 is thermal energy activation via using higher 
reaction temperature or gas pressure, which can make this reaction difficult to industrialize. More attractive and 
green strategies for the utilization of CO2 is photocatalytic or electrocatalysis. About the above aspects, 
photocatalysis is one of the most effective and clean routes, wide application and perspective of pollution 
degradation and hydrogen evolutions.
