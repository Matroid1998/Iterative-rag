Description:
Element present in medicinally relevant molecules containing sulfur (VI) functional groups.

Text:
As a consequence, we recently disclosed an enantioselective 
Pdcatalyzed arylcarbonylation of sulfonimidamides with aryl 
and heteroaryl iodides (Figure 1B).9 This reaction leveraged the 
rapid tautomerization of the imido and amido nitrogens on un
protected sulfonimidamide starting materials, which provided a 
unique opportunity to desymmetrize the prochiral nitrogens via 
dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, Willis and coworkers 
have reported an enantioselective alkylation of protected sul
fonimidamides using cinchona alkaloidderived phasetransfer
