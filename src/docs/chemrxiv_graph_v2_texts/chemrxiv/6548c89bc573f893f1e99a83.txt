Tertiary alcohols containing two aryl groups and their ether derivatives feature across a number of 
11 
pharmaceutical classes (Scheme 1a).1 As such, the efficient synthesis of this motif draws widespread 
12 
interest. Traditional approaches rely on nucleophilic addition of stoichiometric organometallic reagents to 
13 
ketones.2 However, these intermediates can be difficult to prepare and are frequently air and moisture 
14 
sensitive. An alternative, streamlined strategy for construction of this motif from widelyavailable feedstocks 
15 
would be the catalytic intermolecular hydrofunctionalisation of 1,3dienes with carbonyl compounds.3,4 
16 
Beyond minimizing stoichiometric metallic waste, this strategy can offer increased functional group tolerance 
17 
with the products featuring a useful CC bond in close proximity, poised for further functionalisation.
