Description:
A moiety containing iron that underpins the redox capabilities of cytochrome c.

Text:
Cytochrome c (Cyt c), a 12.3 kDa protein, is a focus of research interest due to its unique redox 
properties 1. Located at the inner mitochondrial membrane, Cyt cs redox capabilities originate 
from the iron contained within the central heme moiety, which is capable of existing in Fe2 or 
Fe3 states, underpinning its primary roles in electron transport and apoptosis 2, 3. The 
functionality of such redox proteins extends to diverse sectors, including but not limited to their 
deployment as biocatalysts, their contribution to biofuel development, their integration into 
biosensor technologies, their potential in therapeutic interventions, and their application in genetic 
engineering endeavours. As such, their unique characteristics provoke an intense interest in their 
exploration and utilisation within the scientific community 48.
