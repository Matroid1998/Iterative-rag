Description:
A gas captured from flue gas of coal-fired power plants to prevent global warming.

Text:
The selective gas adsorption properties of nanoporous materials (NPMs) endow them with many
possible applications in the storage 1, 2, separation 3, and sensing 4 of gases. As examples,
promising applications of NPMs include (i, storage) densifying hydrogen (H2)a clean fuelfor com
pact storage onboard vehicles 2, 5, (ii, separation) capturing carbon dioxide from ue gas of coal
red power plants; subsequently sequester it to prevent global warming 6, and (iii, sensing) detect
ing toxic compounds and explosives 7,8. 1
