The incorporation of phosphorus into heterocyclic 
systems can lead to significant changes in their 
properties 
and 
reactivity. Phospholes, 
first 
synthesised in 1959,1 have emerged as highly 
valuable compounds in numerous fields ranging from 
photophysical applications to coordination chemistry, 
and often display aromaticity.25 Utilising phosphorus 
alongside its lighter group 15 congener, nitrogen, can 
bestow 
further 
reactivity 
in 
the 
heterocycle, 
particularly when featuring a direct PVN bond. This 
arises due to the highly polarised nature of the PVN 
bond, which yields significant singlebond character 
and a more basic nitrogen centre.

Description:
Used in heterocycles for luminescent materials and inorganic polymers.

Such phosphorus 
and 
nitrogen 
containing 
heterocycles 
have 
subsequently 
been 
used 
in 
areas 
including 
luminescent materials6 and as building blocks for 
inorganic polymers.7 
The 
majority 
of 
currently 
reported 
phosphorusnitrogen containing heterocycles are 
based on either five or sixmembered rings.8 Seven
membered rings containing both phosphorus and 
nitrogen and comparatively scarce.
