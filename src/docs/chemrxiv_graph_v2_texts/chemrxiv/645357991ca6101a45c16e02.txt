Description:
A metal-organic framework with pores that contribute to high internal surface areas.

Text:
In fact, the IUPAC 
definition of a MOF is a coordination network with organic ligands containing potential voids.2 
These voids (pores) range in diameter from approximately 0.3 nm to greater than 2 nm.3 An 
example is given in Figure 2, which shows the pores of the MOF Cu2(btc)3 (commonly termed 
HKUST1; btc  1,3,5benzene tricarboxylate).4 The presence of empty pores leads to very high 
internal surface areas (SAs)  MOFs with SA greater than 7000 m2g have been reported 
(approximately the area of 1.3 American football fields! ).56 MOFs have the highest surface areas 
of any known materials. Inorganic Unit
