Description:
Complexes studied using 2D IR spectroscopy to investigate groundstate and excitedstate dynamics.

Text:
Recent experimental advances allow for studying
biomolecules at interfaces,17,18 enable transient spectroscopy for following nonequilibrium
protein dynamics,19 and implement spectroelectrochemistry to study redoxactive pro
teins.20,21
Moreover, 2D IR spectroscopy is employed to investigate groundstate and
excitedstate dynamics in model systems such as metal carbonyl complexes2225 and can
be applied in material science to shine light on the ion dynamics in lithium ion batteries.26
However, the interpretation of 2D IR spectra critically depends on computations.2729
Only by comparison to computational predictions, detailed information on the structure
and dynamics can be extracted from experimental 2D IR spectra.
