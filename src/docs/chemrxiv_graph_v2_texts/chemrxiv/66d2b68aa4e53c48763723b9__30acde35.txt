A secondary phase that is detrimental to the performance of LLZO electrolyte.

Syn
thesis of phasepure LLZO is challenging due to easy formation of secondary phases, such
as the pyrochlore La2Zr2O7 and carbonates, that are detrimental to the performance of a
LLZO electrolyte. Furthermore, to prepare highperformance LLZO electrolytes, the fast
ionconducting cubic phase must be stabilized over the tetragonal phase at ambient temper
ature. The synthesis method and conditions, such as temperature, atmosphere, excess Li, and
type of precursors, govern the evolution of LLZO and potential competing phases such as
pyrochlore and carbonates. Hightemperature calcination is necessary to stabilize the cubic
phase of LLZO, but causes evaporation and loss of Li which might lead to decomposition
of LLZO and formation of La2Zr2O7 17,18.
