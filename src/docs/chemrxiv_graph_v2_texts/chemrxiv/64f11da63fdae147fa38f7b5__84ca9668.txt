Description:
A byproduct of water oxidation in solar fuel reactions.

Technological advances have increased the competitiveness of solargenerated electricity 
compared to electricity generated from fossil fuels. Similar advances are necessary to improve 
the direct conversion of sunlight to fuels as a storage medium.13 Important solar fuels reactions 
include water electrolysis (solartohydrogen, STH) or electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to produce 
useful products such as methanol or ethanol.49 A fundamental limit to the energy storage 
efficiency of these processes is the choice of reaction on the anode. In water, the anodic reaction 
is generally water oxidation, where the cathodic products are kept and the O2 is discarded.
