Among the many materials with a 2D structure, the family of transition metal chalcogenophosphates (MPX3; where M  V, Cr, Mn, 
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd and X  S, Se, Te) has recently attracted the growing attention of the research community.1 This interest 
arises from its extensive variety of electronic and magnetic properties.2,3 Thus, for example, these materials exhibit a wide bandgap 
(up to 3.5 eV)4 that broaden their potential application in optoelectronics;5 In addition, these materials exhibit cooperative 
magnetic properties, in particular antiferromagnetism,6 which has been proven to persist even in the 2D limit.7,8 Interestingly, the 
reliance between structural, electronic and magnetic properties boosts their potential in spintronics.6 Furthermore, these 
materials have also been studied as promising candidates for electrocatalytic applications.9 
Notice that most of the works focused on the fundamental characterization of ultrathin layers use dry approaches to obtain these 
layers, either topdown, using the scotchtape method for exfoliating large crystals,10 or bottomup strategies for synthesizing 
nanosheets in a controlled way.11 These methods give rise to high quality single or few layers MPX3 with a low degree of defects.
