Description:
Used as a transparent conductive oxide for touchscreens or solar cells.

Text:
Conductive 
oxides could serve the purpose, since the metals contained are already oxidized to their 
highest oxidation state, leaving no option for further oxidation by electrochemical fluorination 
apart from the oxidation of lattice oxygen. Especially SnO2based conductive oxides are 
prominent due to vast amounts of literature on those materials due to their application as 
transparent conductive oxides for touchscreens or solar cells. However, easy utilization of conductive oxides by ballmilling  in a similar manner to how 
carbonbased cathode composites are prepared  did not yield a conductive composite 6,
