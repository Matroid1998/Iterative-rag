Description:
A chemical that can be produced through CO2 hydrogenation.

Text:
. The United States (US) chemical industry consumes roughly 7,000 trillion BTUs of energy 
annually, accounting for over 10 of the total energy consumption in 20181. As such, the chemical industry 
contributes a significant fraction of the US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ranking 7th amongst 
anthropogenic contributors2. The deepening climate emergency underscores the urgent need to reduce 
the carbon footprint of manufacturing; key contributors to this footprint are the combustion of fossil fuels 
and the production of basic feedstocks. A potential decarbonization strategy consists of capturing and 
converting emitted CO2 into chemicals (e.g., producing methanol through CO2 hydrogenation); alternatively, 
it is also possible to reduce the generation of CO2 during the production of key feedstocks (such as 
hydrogen)3.
