Description:
A later transition metal that has been extensively researched in coordination chemistry.

Ever since Alfred Werner coined the term coordination complex in 1893,1 and was able to 
exemplify his farreaching theory using the example of hexol in 1911,2 the coordination 
chemistry of the later transition metal cobalt (Co) expanded vastly and has been subject of 
extensive research. Among the many compound classes known to date, there are Co(II) 
(silyl)amides, pyrrolates and aminopyridinates. With our longterm research focusing on the 
synthesis of inorganic complexes and their evaluation as precursors for the application in 
chemical gas phase deposition processes such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD),3,4 and our recent interest in the chemistry of 
the later transition metal Co,5 we identified prior mentioned classes as promising model 
systems for our studies.
