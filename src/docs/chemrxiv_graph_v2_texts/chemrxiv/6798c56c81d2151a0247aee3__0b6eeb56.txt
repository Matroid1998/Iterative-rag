Description:
Structurally mimics certain ligand classes.

Text:
Notably, 
these ligand classes structurally mimic the ketoenolate37 
and ketoiminate38,39 ligands and selected transition metal 
complexes have been synthesized with 2N,Ooxazoline
enolates as ligands (Figure 1B).4043 It is noteworthy Shi and 
Niu showcased the applicability of salicyloxazoline (Salox) 
ligands for oxidative enantioselective cobalt(III)catalyzed 
CH activations.44,45 Numerous cobaltaelectrocatalyzed 
CH activations with cobalt acetylacetonato (acac) com
plexes reported by our and other groups18,20,21 and mecha
nistic understanding with electrochemically synthesized 
isolated cobaltacycle intermediates46 encouraged us to as
sess the applicability of chiral 2N,Ooxazoline enolates, 
and amides in enantioselective CH activations. These lig
ands are accessible with modifiable steric and electronic 
features from simple precursors.
