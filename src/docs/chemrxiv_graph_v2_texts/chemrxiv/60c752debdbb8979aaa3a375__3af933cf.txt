Based molecules attract great interest in chemical research.

from ultralow band gaps 15 to spinpolarized bands.16 In fact, also acene
based molecules attract great interest, as for example in the case of starphenes.1720 All of the aforemen
tioned structures may potentially be obtained by onsurface synthesis from the reactant m1 displayed in 
Fig. 1a (see supplementary information note 1 and Figs. S1S5 for synthesis details). It includes two hal
ogen atoms and two methyl groups on either side of the anthracene backbone. Both types of function
alization are included among the first groups whose thermal activation was demonstrated to work in 
onsurface synthesis experiments, leading to the controlled and reproducible covalent coupling of re
actants.21,22 Onsurface, the orthodibromo moiety could afford an aryne (named as head, Fig.
