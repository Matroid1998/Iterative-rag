Description:
Isoelectronic with CaBi2 but lacks a Bi square lattice.

Text:
Bi is known to form several stable hypervalent polyan
ions, such as Bi square network found in LiBi and NaBi but not 
observed in the isoelectronic NaSb14. Similarly, CaBi2 and the 
recently reported SrBi2 both host a hypervalent Bi square lattice 
5,6, which is missing in the isoelectronic CaSb2 7. A number of binary bismuth superconductors are known, in
cluding Ca11Bi10x 8, CaBi2 9,10, SrBi3 11,12, BaBi3 13, Ba2Bi3 14, 
LiBi 4,15, NaBi 3, KBi2 1618, RbBi2 18, and CsBi2 19. The latter 
three compounds are cubic Laves phases, crystallizing in a re
latively simple MgCu2type structure in which Bi atoms form a 
pyrochlore (vertex sharing tetrahedral) network (Fig. 1).
