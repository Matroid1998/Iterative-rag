Description:
A material used in detectors that are highly sensitive to NO2 even at room temperature.

For most TMDs, the sheets can be
either semiconducting (1H) or metallic (1T) 9, and for the former, the
size of the bandgap depends on the comprising elements and the num
ber of sheets stacked 1012. As a result, TMDs offer good chemical
stability and a versatile set of electronic properties, which have ben
efited several highperformance electronic devices, notably chemical
sensors and fieldeffect transistors (FETs). Detectors based on MoS2
and MoTe2 have been reported as highly sensitive to NO2 even when
operating at room temperature 1317, despite conventional metal
oxidesemiconductor (MOS) sensors requiring heating to several hun
dred C to operate efficiently 1820. Likewise, TMDbased FETs
have shown improved performance 2123 and low devicetodevice
variation 24, illustrating the maturity of the processing technology.
