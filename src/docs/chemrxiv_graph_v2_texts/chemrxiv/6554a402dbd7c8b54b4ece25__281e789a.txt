Description:
A purine with a single ligand that appears to be more photostable.

Text:
guanine(13) and isoguanine(14)) may be more photostable
than the homosubstituted purines (2,6diaminopurine and xanthine(15, 16)), while purines
with a single ligand (adenine,(17) 2AP,(18) 2oxopurine,(19) and hypoxanthine(20)) appear
to be more photostable than most purines with two ligands. (13) MartinezFernandez et al. in a thorough computational study on the photostability effects of position and oxoamino
substitution for purines with a single ligand,(19) found that amino or oxo substitution at C2
has little effect on the photodynamics, while C6 functionalization leads to photostability. However, these general trends do not include details, such as the role of the solvent. A wellknown example of this structure dependence is the difference between
adenine (6aminopurine), and its isomer 2aminopurine (2AP). 2AP has a strong
fluorescence signature in aqueous solution, while adenine does not.

Description:
In the gas phase, it has an excited-state lifetime of the order of single picoseconds or less.

Text:
Adenine in the gas
phase has an excitedstate lifetime of the order of single picoseconds or less depending on
the exact measurement technique,(4, 2125) with similar lifetimes reported in solution. (26)
The lowest excited singlet state of adenine exhibits n character and significant 1n1
mixing after initial excitation. (2631) Adenine undergoes aromatic ring puckering
associated with C2H tilting and outofplane deformation at the C2N3 position to reach an
S1S0 conical intersection (CI) with a barrier of about 0.1 eV, enabling relaxation to the
electronic ground state. In contrast, Lobsiger et al. found isolated 2AP to have an
excitedstate lifetime of 150 ps when excited near the excitation threshold, which is
significantly longer than in the case of isolated adenine.

Undergoes aromatic ring puckering associated with C2H tilting and out-of-plane deformation at the C2N3 position to reach an S1S0 conical intersection with a barrier of about 0.1 eV.

Description:
Can relax via NH bond breaking at higher excitation energies.

Text:
(18) Furthermore, these authors
observed another decay component with a lifetime of more than 2 s, attributed to a triplet
state populated by intersystem crossing. The lifetime increases significantly upon
microhydration near the amino group in the C2 position, i.e., up to a hundredfold compared
to the isolated molecule. This increase presumably corresponds to the fluorescence decay
noted for solvated 2AP. (3235)
The excitedstate dynamics also depends on the irradiation wavelength, especially
near excitation threshold (origin transition) where dynamics can be slow. In that case the
dynamics can be hypersensitive to any barriers, which can modulate competing relaxation
pathways. For instance, at higher excitation energies, adenine can also relax via NH bond
breaking, which occurs in the 1 state.
