Substances known for environmental bioaccumulation and long halflives.

The thermal destruction of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has garnered much attention
recently due to concerns of adverse health effects, environmental bioaccumulation, and long
halflives.15 Full mineralization of all CF bonds into HF and CO2 is necessary for effective
removal of PFAS from contaminated matrices, but the combustion is often incomplete.

Description:
Chains that undergo homolytic dissociation in radical-radical reaction channels during the destruction of perfluorinated acids.

Text:
The
difficulty in experimentally characterizing the products of incomplete combustion, which are
potentially hazardous, has prompted a variety of computational studies into the chemical
reaction mechanisms of PFAS pyrolysis and oxidation.610
Extensive examinations of the thermochemistry of species involved in the destruction of
perfluorinated carboxylic acids and perfluorinated sulfonic acids indicate that radicalradical
reaction channels, such as homolytic dissociation within perfluoroalkyl chains, are likely
important alongside molecular or pericyclic reactions with sufficiently low electronic barriers
to contribute at incineration conditions. However, in the existing theoretical studies on
PFAS thermal decomposition, the consideration of barrierless reactions has been limited.

Description:
Involved in carbon-carbon bond scissions and radical combinations.

Text:
An example is the variational transitionstate theory treatment of reactions like fluorine
atom loss or singletCF2 dissociation from nperfluoroalkyl radicals or the dissociation of
the carbonsulfur bond in perfluorinated sulfonic acids, using bondstretching coordinates
and singlereference density functional methods by Altarawneh and coworkers.7,8 While
these reactions may be relevant to PFAS thermal decomposition, the series of carboncarbon
bond scissions (and their reverse associations) within perfluoroalkyl chains indicated to be
important by bond dissociation energies have not been studied thoroughly. Wardlaw and
coworkers have carried out a theoretical study of 2 CF3 
C2F6 using canonical flexible
transition state theory,11 but more refined theoretical studies of this reaction and studies of
the size dependence of perfluoroalkyl radical combinations have not been published to our
knowledge.
