Description:
Intermediates that decompose thermally to yield deoxygenated, cross-coupled products.

Text:
A pioneering approach, that 
enables the direct coupling of sp2 and sp3 electrophiles, such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids, heralds 
an unprecedented disconnection in the crosselectrophile coupling domain (Figure 1A). Aryl sulfonyl 
hydrazones are considered as a benchstable, activated form of aldehydes due to their known propensity 
to undergo both radical and polar addition, ultimately yielding deoxygenated, crosscoupled products 
upon thermal decomposition of alkylated hydrazide intermediates (Figure 1B).1827 Utilizing abundant 
aliphatic carboxylic acids activated as NHPIbased redoxactive esters (RAEs) to serve as sp3 
electrophiles, and employing visible lightmediated decarboxylation to yield carboncentered
