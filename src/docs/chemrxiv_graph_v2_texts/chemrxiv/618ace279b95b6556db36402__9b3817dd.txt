Description:
A product of CO2 electrolysis and a valuable feedstock for the chemical industry.

Yet, 
photochemical or electrochemical reduction strategies enabling 
to produce C1 and C2 chemicals from flue gases will certainly be 
one of the essential bricks of the next industrial revolution.15, 16 
The main products of CO2 electrolysis are usually CO, CH4, C2H4, 
formate, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH,17 which are valuable 
feedstocks for the chemical industry and for energy storage. A 
large array of transition metal complexes18 containing 
macrocyclic, (e.g. porphyrins, phthalocyanines, corroles and 
cyclams),1921 polydentate, (e.g. 2,2bipyridine (bpy), 1,10
phenantroline (phen), etc. )2224 and phosphine ligands (e.g. 1,2
bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane 
(dppe), 
triphenylphosphine 
(PPh3), etc. )2527 have been tested as molecular electrocatalysts 
in solutions, wherein CO2 was injected as a pure gas. Re and 
Mnpolypyridine complexes were shown to be among the most 
promising catalysts, displaying high reaction rates and 
selectivity.
