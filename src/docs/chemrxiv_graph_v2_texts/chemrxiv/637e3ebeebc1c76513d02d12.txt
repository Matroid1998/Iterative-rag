Description:
A gas that can be extracted from air using a chemical sorbent and stored permanently in DACS technology.

CO2 emissions are required from between 2040 and 2070.4 Direct air capture (DAC) and storage 
35 
(DACS) is a technological solution to CDR. DAC entails the extraction of CO2 from air using (in most 
36 
cases) a chemical sorbent and subsequent release of that CO2 from the sorbent. When that released CO2 
37 
is stored permanently, then this is DACS.
