Description:
Involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Text:
The exfoliated MoS2 form was demonstrated to have a

better performance in the inactivation of Escherichia coli biofilm production, this difference 
32 
being attributed to an enhanced creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to their higher 
33 
electron conductivity when in 2D form.27
