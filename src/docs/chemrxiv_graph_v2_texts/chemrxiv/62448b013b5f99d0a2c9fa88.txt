Description:
A component of tribofilms formed by ZDDP on steel substrates.

Text:
To 
rationally design antiwear additives with improved performance, a molecularlevel 
understanding of the tribofilm formation and wearreduction mechanisms of ZDDP are first 
required.2 The tribofilms formed by ZDDP on steel substrates are mainly composed of zinc and 
iron polyphosphates.3 These are formed by nucleophilic substitution reactions at the P atoms, 
which result in the formation of the POP chains.5 This reaction is dramatically accelerated once 

4
some of the alkyl or aryl groups (that are added to ensure solubility in the base oil) are removed 
through CO cleavage.6 Therefore, ZDDPs containing different alkyl and aryl groups show greatly 
varying tribofilm growth and antiwear performance;79 however, the underlying molecular 
mechanisms for these differences in macroscale behavior remain unclear.
