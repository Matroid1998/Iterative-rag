Description:
Nonaqueous solvents explored for coordination with metal complexes.

However, these are extreme cases  in most instances, no such idealised
intermediate exists, and instead, a concerted interchange mechanism with dissociative (Id)
or associate (Ia) characteristics occurs.2,3
Of particular interest is ligand exchange with solvent, with metal aqua complexes being
the most extensively studied.4 The rate of this exchange depends on the nature of the metal
ion, particularly ionic radii, charge, and coordination environment, ranging from 200 ps for
Cs to 300 years for Ir3.4 Coordination with nonaqueous solvents such as alcohols, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (MeCN), and amides, has also been explored.5
Among the cations investigated, significant efforts have been made to study Mg2 com
plexes due to their prominent role in biology, including RNA folding, ATP hydrolysis, cellular
signalling, and photosynthesis.6 In aqueous solution, Mg2 forms octahedral Mg(H2O)62
complexes with a MgO distance of 2.10 A, surrounded by a second solvation shell of 12 wa
ter molecules.79 Water molecules in the first solvation shell are tightly bound to the cation
and undergo exchange with the bulk solvent molecules on the microsecond timescale (k 
5.3 105 s1 at 298 K) via a dissociative or interchangedissociative mechanism.10,11
Another important example is Pd2, which although less prevalent in biology has an ir
replaceable role in organocatalysis1214 and supramolecular chemistry.1520 Pd2 complexes
