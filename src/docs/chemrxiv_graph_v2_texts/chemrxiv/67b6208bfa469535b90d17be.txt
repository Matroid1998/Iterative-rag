Description:
Used in the vapor phase process with NB in a tubular reactor.

Text:
In the vapor phase process NB is fed 
with hydrogen into a tubular reactor containing a supported Cu catalyst at 270 290 C and 15 bar in the 
presence of a 91 (H2NB) excess of hydrogen.2 In the liquid phase process, the capability for utilization of 
reaction heat (more than 500 kJ mol1) is much higher due to higher heat transfer coefficient, and supported 
noble metals (palladium and platinum) are employed.3 
Given the industrial and economic relevance of the process, plentiful academic and industrial research is 
still conducted today to improve the existing processes.4 In 2005, Jackson in collaboration with catalysis 
industrys researchers demonstrated that the Habers threestep reaction mechanism (aniline converted to 
nitrosobenzene, the latter to phenylhydroxylamine, and phenylhydroxylamine to aniline) is wrong.5 The 
newly suggested reaction mechanism indicates formation of PhN(OH) (nitrobenzene) as surface interme
diate.

Description:
Reacts with PhN(OH) to form aniline.

Text:
In said mechanism, PhN(OH) either reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form aniline, or PhN(OH) 
reacts with itself to eliminate water and produce azoxybenzene.5 
Ideally, hydrogenation of NB to aniline at completion would be carried out in liquidphase at low tempera
ture over a solid catalyst employing earthabundant and lowcost Ni in place of Pt or Pd. So far, to the 
best of our knowledge, no such catalyst has been reported.
