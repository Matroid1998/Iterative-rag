Description:
Cations used in germanium 2D MHPs to study structural distortion parameters on optical properties.

However, Gecontaining 2D or even 3D perovskites have 
been very scarcely considered in the current literature even though some encouraging and 
interesting properties have been demonstrated in several applicative fields.6,1116 Such lack of 
investigation strongly limits the establishment of solid structureproperty correlation in Ge
based perovskites which is a prerequisite to design optimized and novel materials. We recently 
tried to fill this gap by computationally and experimentally exploring a series of germanium 2D 
MHPs including aromatic monoammonium cations clarifying the role of different structural 
distortion parameters on the optical properties.16 Such work allowed us, for example, to further
