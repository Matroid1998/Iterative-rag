Description:
A polar solvent often avoided in ESIMS analysis due to its strong coordinating properties.

Some of the more unusual 
examples 
involved 
in 
successful 
analyses 
that 
we 
have 
demonstrated 
include 
dimethylformamide,6 fluorobenzene,7 chlorobenzene,8 and 1,2difluorobenzene.9 Reasons for 
avoiding the polar solvents typical of ESIMS analysis usually concern reactivity, with strongly 
coordinating andor protic solvents being incompatible with, for example, reactive organometallic 
species.9
