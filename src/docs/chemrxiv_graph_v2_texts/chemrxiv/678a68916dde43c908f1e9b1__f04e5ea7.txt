Description:
Produced through enzyme-like activities of resorcinol-formaldehyde resins.

Text:
Used as a glue for more than 70 years, resorcinolfromaldehyde
resins (RFs) are inexpensive organic polymers synthesized
by condensation between formaldhyde and resorcinol. They
are now widely used as adhesives, 1 for hydrogels and aero
gel preparation 2,3. Pioneering work carried out by Zhang
et al. 4 in 2015 let to the discovery of semiconductive and
photocatalytic properties of RFs, and since then, various
works highlighted the efficiency of RFs for photodegrada
tion of organic pollutants, 49, water oxidation 4, enzyme
like activities 10,11, H2O2 production. 9,1218. Efforts have
been made to control the semiconductive properties and
morphology of RF resins, by varying synthetic conditions,
tailoring, organic or metal doping.
