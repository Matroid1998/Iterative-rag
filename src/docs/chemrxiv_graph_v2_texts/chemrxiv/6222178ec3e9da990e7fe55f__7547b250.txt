Description:
A five-membered aromatic heterocyclic ring system.

Use of Hammett equation 14 dealing with meta and parasubstituted 
benzene derivatives and Taft equation 5, 6 dealing with orthosubstituted benzene 
derivatives in elucidating the reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry is indubitable. Since 
their introduction 16 numerous publications have appeared in literature 3, 4 and still 
being published to date. Application of Hammett equation and Taft equation to five 
membered aromatic heterocyclic ring systems was less commonly studied. The first

application of Hammett law (not as an equation) 7 to furan ring was with 5X2furoic acids 
8. But this was quoted in reference 9 as it was published in 1935 10 even before the 
Hammett equation came into existence.

A heterocyclic compound used in organic chemistry.

In reference 9 by Freeman it is surprising to see 
even a Hammett  value was reported for the dissociation of 5X2furoic acids without 
knowing Hammett  values because evaluation of Hammett  values took place only in 1937 
1. In spite of numerous works on the application of Hammett and Taft equations in organic 
chemistry, their application to five membered ring systems did not find much place in 
chemistry research 8, 11 except a onepage small publication appeared 50 years ago 9 and 
references cited there in. In this publication 9 the information of substituents in furan and 
thiophene derivatives used did not find a place. In the present work we tried a deep insight 
with a total of 12 heterocyclic systems.
