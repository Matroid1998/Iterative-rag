Description:
Used in the Blanc reaction to form chloromethyl arenes.

Text:
Typically, modification involves 
modifying chemically active sites or increasing the reactivity of both aromatic and aliphatic 
hydroxyl groups. However, this strategy only aims to produce more efficient, more reactive 
macromonomers. Although the Blanc reaction, a chemical method to form chloromethyl arenes 
with formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride catalyzed by Lewis acids has been widely used for about
