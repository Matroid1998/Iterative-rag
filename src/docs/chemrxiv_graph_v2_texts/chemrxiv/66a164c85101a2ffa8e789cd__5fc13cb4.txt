Description:
A type of lead halide perovskite where X can be Cl, Br, or I, noted for excitonic coupling and superfluorescence.

Text:
More recently, studies on superlattices of lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, where X  Cl, Br, 
I) have drawn attention to excitonic coupling, which in these materials results in an unusually 
high exciton diffusivity7 and in quantum coherent light emission known as 
superfluorescence.8 Both phenomena are reportedly mediated by dipoledipole coupling,911 
which depends on the relative spatial position and exciton energy of the interacting particles.

Description:
Nanocrystals with narrow size distribution and faceted shape promoting higher order packing and structural coherence.

Text:
This makes CsPbX3 nanocrystals the ideal test system their narrow size distribution leads to 
high energetic homogeneity,12,13 while their faceted shape promotes higher order packing than 
spherical quantum dots,14 leading to a structural coherence comparable to that of epitaxial 
films.15 
As the energetic and structural disorder are expected to affect the coupling strength, the optical 
properties of superlattices are often studied under cryogenic conditions, where the thermal 
quenching of lattice vibrations further narrows the emission spectrum and minimizes thermal 
decoherence.1618 However, this implies the assumption that the structure of superlattices 
remains unchanged upon cooling, or at least that modifications are negligible.

Description:
Cuboidal nanocrystals that form a simple cubic superlattice.

Text:
This is a 
reasonable expectation, since disorder is often associated with an increase in temperature and a 
superlattice contraction occurs upon cooling.19 Indeed, the few reported lowtemperature 
transformations in superlattices are phase transitions between different packing symmetries (for 
example, a FaceCentered Cubic  BodyCentered Tetragonal phase transition for spherical 
particles).20,21 Hence, a significant phase transition is not expected in a simplecubic 
superlattice made of cuboidal CsPbX3 nanocrystals. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20245q319 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000164398132 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
