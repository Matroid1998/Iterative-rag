Description:
An oxidation phase of uranium.

Text:
Currently, uranium compounds are being studied more closely due to their potentiality in 
benefiting environmental safety in maximizing the utilization of limited sources.24 
Upon studying uranium, the uranium framework contains linear structure ions and donor 
ions, through this characteristic one can confirm the donor atoms from the organic ligands will 
display uranyl equatorial positions which give rise to clusters, 1D chains, or 20 layers.510 The 
challenge with this element stems from the element displaying different physical and chemical 
properties existing in four different oxidation states of 3, 4, 5, 6. The oxidation states of 3 
and 5 are very stable, leading this earth metal to exist in oxidation phase UO2, U3O8, and U3O11.

Description:
Used in catalysis reactions in an aqueous environment.

Text:
This study aims to discuss the proper methodology for synthesizing U3O8 using the silica 
gel matrix for enhanced catalysis reactions in an aqueous environment at atmospheric pressure, 
provide the proper techniques on creating simple costeffective composites, with the addition of 
acetic acid (CHCOOH), Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and standard no acid to create a homogenous 
mixture after heat treatment was conducted on uranyl acetate for final confirmation; the protocol 
with the two acids can aid in providing homogenous mixture similar to no acid catalysis.
