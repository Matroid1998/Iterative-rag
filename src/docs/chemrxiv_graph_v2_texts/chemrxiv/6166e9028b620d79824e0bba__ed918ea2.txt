Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are network solids wherein metal ions or clusters are connected 
36 
by organic ligands into extended structures.1 A number of MOFs have been proposed as potential gas 
37 
capture and separation materials,27 including candidates for H2 storage applications,815 due to their 
38 
prodigious storage capacities and ease of structure optimisation and functionalisation.
