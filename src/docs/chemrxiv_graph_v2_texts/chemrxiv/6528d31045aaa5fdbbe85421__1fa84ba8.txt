Description:
A component of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) used as a low-viscosity photocurable ink.

Text:
In the model system 
demonstrated here, oppositely charged diblock or triblock polyelectrolytes (DbPEs and TbPEs) 
serve as building blocks of electrostatic selfassemblies  micelles or network, respectively37  
while gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) at 37 C serves as a representative lowviscosity photocurable 
ink. Mixing of the three ink constituents (the oppositely charged block polyelectrolytes and the 
crosslinkable precursors) results in swift assembly of GelMAcontaining viscous and extrudable 
PEC hydrogel inks. The PEC hydrogels recover quickly (significantly faster than hydrogenbonded 
biopolymer hydrogels) upon deposition, providing structural robustness and enabling multilayer
