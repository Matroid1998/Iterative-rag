Description:
A transition metal commonly used as a catalyst in organic chemistry.

Text:
Even in recent years, some Fecatalyzed or
ganic chemical reactions have been reported.10 However, the 
catalytic use of iron in organic chemistry is less common than 
that of other transition metals such as Pd, Ni, and Cocata
lyst. In this context, we report the direct CC bond formation 
reaction using a redoxneutral Feelectrocatalytic deoxygen
ative Giese reaction.
