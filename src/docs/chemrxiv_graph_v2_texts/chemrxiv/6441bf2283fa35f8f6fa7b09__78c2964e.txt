Description:
An atmospheric oxidant that can oxidize brown carbon, reducing its absorptive properties and climatic impact.

Text:
It contains a large amount of organic molecules that absorb 
UV and visible light, known as brown carbon (BrC), which leads to a warming of the earth
atmospheric system (912). While in the atmosphere, BrC can become oxidized by ozone or other 
atmospheric oxidants, eventually causing BBOA to become less absorbing with a weaker climatic 
impact (1318). Despite the importance of BBOA, our understanding of the physical and chemical 
properties of BBOA particles is limited, leading to uncertainties in its impact on the global radiation 
budget. 2
