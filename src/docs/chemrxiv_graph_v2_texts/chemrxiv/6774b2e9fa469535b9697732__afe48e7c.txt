Description:
Intercalates into graphite, screening van der Waals interactions and causing graphene layers to glide.

Text:
Upon Li intercalation, the vdW interac
tions are screened, and the graphene layers glide with respect to
each other, resulting in a symmetry change from an AB stacking
(see Figure 1b) in graphite (C6) to an AA stacking (see Figure
