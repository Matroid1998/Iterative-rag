Description:
A framework used in multiresonant TADF emitters for narrowband emission.

At present, commercialized highresolution OLED displays mainly employ a color filter or 
microcavity to reach the color purity required by broadcasting standards, which is inevitably 
accompanied by losses in device efficiency and energy utilization.7 Therefore, it would be of great 
utility to devise an emitter showing narrowband emission. Recently, Hatakeyama et al. introduced a 
subclass of TADF emitters coined multiresonant TADF (MRTADF), that show the desired 
narrowband emission. This is due to their rigid polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) framework,8 where 
the rigid molecular skeleton and the shortrange CT (SRCT) nature of the emissive singlet excited 
state enable simultaneously narrowband emission and small DES1T1. In this design, the electron 
densities of the HOMO and LUMO are localized on the adjacent atoms.
