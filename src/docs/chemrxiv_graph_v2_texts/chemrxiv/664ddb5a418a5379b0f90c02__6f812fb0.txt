Description:
A core structure present in a large number of bioactive natural products.

Text:
Azaarenes with alkyl substitution at different positions are 
important synthetic goals owing to their frequent occurrence in 
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, chiral ligands, catalysts, and 
materials.1 Direct CH alkylation of abundant and inexpensive 
azaarenes is the most attractive approach for sustainable and 
wastefree synthesis.2 Among them, isoquinoline core is present 
in one of the largest numbers of bioactive natural products.3 
Substitution at each carbon of the isoquinoline core is prevalent, 
including metafunctionalized bioactive compounds with sub
stituted alkyl groups.4 Among different CH bonds, ortho and 
paraalkylation were achieved successfully with a broad range 
of electronically and sterically diverse substituents.5 However, 
the metaCH alkylation remained a formidable challenge due 
to its inertness towards both electrophilic and nucleophilic rea
gents.

Description:
A compound used in the synthesis of natural products with meta-alkyl substitution.

Text:
As a result, most of the isoquinoline natural products con
taining metaalkyl substitution were synthesized from their al
kyl substituted acyclic precursors.6 
In a more direct approach, Minter and Re in 1988 showed a 
onepot multistep operation for effective metaCH alkylation 
of isoquinolines with aldehydes (Figure 1A).7a This strategy is 
based on reductive hydroboration, followed by electrophilic 
functionalization of the resulting enamine, and finally, dehydra
tiontautomerization for the overall metaalkylation. The reac
tion was shown to work only with aldehydes, limiting it to the 
installation of primary alkyl groups. In 2022, the Wang group developed an improved Lewis acid 
catalyzed reductive hydroboration to enamine and its electro
philic functionalization at metaCH.
