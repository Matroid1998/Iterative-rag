Our report demonstrates the potential of cooperative catalysis to produce previously 
inaccessible maingroup rich materials with beneficial chemical and physical properties 
Introduction 
The incorporation of sulfur centres into the 
polymer main chain rationally offers distinct 
material properties and functions associated with 
the periodic trends of the maingroup elements.1 
The altered electronic nature of sulfur containing 
polymers compared to their lighter oxygen 
analogues causes amongst others degradability 
benefits, the potential to scavenge heavy metal 
contaminants, high refractive indices, stimuli 
responsiveness in drug delivery systems and 
enhanced 
semicrystallinity.27 
Moving 
from 
oxygenated 
to 
sulfurated 
polymers 
can 
furthermore 
be 
used 
to 
tune 
the 
(de)polymerisation equilibria of polymers to 
facilitate 
chemical 
polymer 
recling.810 
Furthermore, using monomers which can be 
directly sourced from elemental sulfur (such as 
CS2 from S8 and methane) is also relevant in the 
context of S8 utilization, a waste product of the 
petrochemical industry being produced at an 
annual megaton surplus.1115 Sulfur containing 
polymers are often synthesized by condensation 
or ringopening polymerisation (ROP) methods, 
which can require multistep monomer synthesis 
and do not give easy access to many polymer 
structures.16,17 An increasingly popular method for 
the synthesis of heteroatom containing polymers 
is the ringopening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of 
a strained heterocycle with heteroallenes.
