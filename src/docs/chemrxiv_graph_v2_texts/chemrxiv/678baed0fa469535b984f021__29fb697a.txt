Description:
Reacts with trifluoromethyl ketones and magnesium to form difluoroenol silyl ethers.

As a result, only a few exam
ples of radicalbased defluorinative functionalization of trifluo
romethyl ketones have been reported to date.6 
For trifluoromethyl ketones, the most established approach in
volves the generation of difluoroenol silyl ethers, as demon
strated by Uneyama and Amii (Figure 1B).7 In this method, tri
fluoromethyl ketones are treated with magnesium and TMSCl 
to form difluoroenol silyl ethers, which can react at the posi
tion with various electrophiles to produce difluoromethyl com
pounds.8 While effective, this strategy requires the difluoroenol 
silyl ether to be prepared in a separate step, limiting its practical 
application.9 While other difluoroenolate surrogates have been 
reported,10,11 they are typically unstable and cannot be isolated. Furthermore, they lack the versatile reactivity exhibited by 
difluoroenol silyl ethers.
