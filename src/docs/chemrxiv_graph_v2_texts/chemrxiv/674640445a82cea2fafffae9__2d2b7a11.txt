Used in complexes for carbon monoxide release in therapeutic applications.

Transition metal complexes (TMCs) have long been utilized in medicinal chemistry 
for a variety of therapeutic applications, including anticancer and antimicrobial 
treatments, due to their rich excitedstate properties.13 Particularly, TMCs that enable 
selective ligand release have proven highly effective in drug delivery systems.4 One 
class of these ligands includes gasotransmitterssmall molecules such as nitric oxide 
(NO) and carbon monoxide (CO).5 Several TMCs have been developed as tools for 
releasing these small molecules for therapeutic purposes.68 For instance, ruthenium 
and ironbased complexes are used for NO release,9,10 while rhenium and manganese
based complexes are employed for CO release.11,12 A major global threat today is 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is projected to result in 10 million deaths 
annually by 2050, alongside a reduction in global economy by 2 to 3.5, costing the 
world up to 100 trillion.1315 One promising approach to combat AMR is through the 
use of CO, a gasotransmitter with known antimicrobial properties, which has been 
studied as a potential treatment for infectious diseases.16 Recently, photoactivatable 
carbon monoxide releasing molecules (PhotoCORMs) have been suggested as a new 
synthetic class of antimicrobials to fight against AMR, such molecules enable spatial 
and temporal control of CO release process.17
