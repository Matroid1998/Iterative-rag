Description:
Traditional techniques like X-ray crystallography cannot distinguish between aluminium and silicon atoms.

Zeolite ZSM5 stands out as one
of the most extensively used zeolites in the petrochemical industry,
where it can serve as an efficient catalyst for hydrocarbon trans
formations.1,2 The catalytic activity of zeolites is primarily gov
erned by their chemical composition, with structural features such
as channel shape, accessible pore volume, and the positioning of
aluminium atoms within the framework significantly influencing
their catalytic behaviour.24
Accurately determining the position of aluminium atoms within
the zeolite framework is useful for understanding and optimizing
catalytic properties.2,4 However, traditional techniques like Xray
crystallography have inadequate sensitivity for distinguishing be
tween aluminium and silicon atoms and thus it cannot be used for
the determination of the aluminium siting.
