Description:
Simple lipids involved in prebiotic chemistry and the formation of supramolecular structures.

Text:
Due to their prebiotic availability and spontaneous generation of supramolecular structures, lipids have been 
widely implicated in studies of the origin of life. The traditional view of a protocell particularly invokes a vesicular 
bilayer surrounding an assortment of replicating polymers within its lumen interior7, 8. The proposed role of the 
lipid bilayer in such studies is to sustain the replicating polymers and prevent them from diffusing away. This 
view has elicited a renewed focus on lipid systems in the context of prebiotic chemistry9, 10, usually comprised 
of simple lipids such as fatty acids and alcohols11. Recent accounts5, 12 have suggested that lipids have other 
important functionalities besides acting as barriers between the protocellular inner network and the aqueous 
solution.
