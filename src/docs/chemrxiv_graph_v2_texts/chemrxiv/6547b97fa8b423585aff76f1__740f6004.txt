Description:
Pure-silica zeolites that can store mechanical energy when electrolyte solutions are used.

Text:
Historically, intrusion of water in puresilica zeolites (also called zeosils) has been
first reported in 20019 and represents the starting point of subsequent intrusion and extrusion
experiments performed on various zeosils.1019 Later, Tzanis and coworkers20 discovered
that replacing water by electrolyte solutions was an effective way to increase mechanical
energy stored in zeosils, because of the shift of intrusion pressure towards higher values. For instance, it was shown that intrusion of highly concentrated LiCl solution (20 M) in
silicalite1 increases intrusion pressure from 96 MPa to 280 MPa, resulting in an increase of
