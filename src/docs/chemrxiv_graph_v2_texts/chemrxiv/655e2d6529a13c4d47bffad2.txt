Description:
Complexes with promising antibacterial properties, with one compound family undergoing preclinical evaluations.

We could show 
that metal complexes did not possess higher rates of cytotoxicity or haemolysis 
against human cells compared to their organic counterparts.14 Ruthenium complexes 
in particular seem to have promising antibacterial properties, with one compound 
family currently undergoing preclinical evaluations.9,16,17 However, at this stage the 
vast transition metal chemical space remains largely uncharted, particularly in 
comparison with the vast screening campaigns that have been performed on organic 
molecules. Machinelearning (ML) approaches have been applied to different facets of the drug 
discovery process, including the prediction of bioactive compounds. In 2020, Stokes 
et al. reported the application of deep learning to the prediction of antibacterial 
compounds. The authors trained a deep neural network on Escherichia coli growth 
inhibition data of 2,335 unique compounds.
