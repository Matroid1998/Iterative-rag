Description:
A renewable feedstock derived from lignin biomass, providing a source of sustainable aromatic carbon.

22 P450GcoA, in 
particular, gained special attention as it catalyses the downstream lignin degradation which can 
potentially be used to produce a dropin biofuel.23Lignin is ubiquitous in the biosphere and it 
alone constitutes 1530 of Lignocellulosic biomass (LB). Moreover, the pulp and paper 
industry alone produces around 5060 million tons of lignin each year which further adds to 
this enormous renewable carbon feedstock.2425 Lignin biomass, therefore, is an unexploited 
treasure that provides an excellent source of sustainable aromatic carbon. Hence, 
understanding the mechanism of downstream lignin breakdown for potential biofuel 
production could be pivotal for the bioengineering of this natural enzyme to enhance biofuel 
production.
