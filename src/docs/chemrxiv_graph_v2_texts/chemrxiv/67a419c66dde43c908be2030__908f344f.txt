Description:
An essential element for life and a core component of most synthetic fertilizers.

Text:
Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for life that, along with nitrogen (N) and potassium, forms 
the core of most synthetic fertilizers. The demand for increased agricultural yields driven by the need to 
feed a growing population has resulted in global phosphorus fertilizer application tripling over the last 60 
years.1 However, modern phosphorus fertilizer production is unsustainable.

Description:
A nonrenewable resource used in agricultural production, sourced from phosphate rock deposits.

Text:
Approximately 80 of the 
phosphorus used for agricultural production is sourced from phosphate rock deposits which were formed 
over millions of years.2 These deposits are a nonrenewable resource, and the accelerated rate of depletion 
has raised concerns over a peak phosphorus event in the near future, where increased resource scarcity 
results in shortages and increased prices.2,3 Such a scenario would undoubtedly affect vulnerable, low
income communities the most, putting them at an increased risk of food insecurity and malnutrition. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20253n9sdv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000226874385 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
