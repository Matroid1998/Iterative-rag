Description:
Used in a coreshell coaxial electrospinning strategy.

Different 
17 
strategies have been used to aid the electrospinning process, such as adding flexible polymers, 
18 
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(caprolactone), in the spinning solution of P3HT, or using 
19 
a coreshell coaxial electrospinning strategy using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).5,20,21,24,25 
20 
The usage of high molecular weight of PEO is common, which has shown to lead to uniform, bead
21 
free fibers.20,22,2426 Interestingly, few studies have also reported the electrospinning of P3HT 
22 
without adding any flexible polymers.23,2729 Although high P3HT concentration led to gelation,
