Description:
A precursor dye used in primary brain tumor surgery that exhibits high water-solubility.

Text:
The established treatment of primary brain tumors includes an initial tumor resection in a surgical 
procedure using fluorescencesupported tumor tissue visualization (8). For this purpose, the patient is 
administered a fluorescent dye, capable of passing the disrupted bloodbrainbarrier that selectively 
accumulates in the cancerous tissue. Precise tumor removal is then aided by the use of intermittent dye
specific illumination, which allows better contrast between healthy and cancerous brain tissue (9). The 
application of 5aminolevulinic acid (5ALA), as a precursor dye, is currently considered the gold 
standard for primary brain tumor surgery (10, 11). This molecule exhibits high watersolubility, which 
facilitates its implementation as pharmaceutical formulation, and thus its administration to the patient.
