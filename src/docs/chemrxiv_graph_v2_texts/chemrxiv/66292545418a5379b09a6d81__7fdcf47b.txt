Description:
Formed via cyclisation using synthetic and biological methods.

Text:
Cyclisation via amide bond formation has 
been applied using both synthetic methods (peptide ligation11
13) and biological approaches exploiting intein chemistry (e.g., 
SICLOPPS14, 15), mRNA display,10 and ligase enzymes.16 Due to 
the nucleophilicity of the thiol sidechain, numerous Cys
selective reactions (beyond disulfide and thioether formation) 
have been developedrepurposed for peptide cyclisation.
