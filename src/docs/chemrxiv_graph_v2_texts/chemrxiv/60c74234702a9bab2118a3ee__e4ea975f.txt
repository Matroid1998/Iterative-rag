Description:
Structurally the same scaffold as ATXII but lacking the epoxide, reported to be mutagenic in vitro.

Only a few LCMS 
68 
based methods allow to determine and accurately quantify this potent toxin, after having isolated the 
69 
compound from fungal cultures (Liu and Rychlik, 2015; Puntscher et al., 2019a; Puntscher et al., 2018; 
70 
Zwickel et al., 2016). While genotoxic and mutagenic effects of AOH described in vitro (Brugger et al., 
71 
2006) were linked to topoisomerase I and II poisoning (Fehr et al., 2009), the mechanism of action 
72 
related to ATXII has not been elucidated so far. The reactive epoxide of ATXII is likely to be involved 
73 
in toxicological effects. However, even altertoxin I (ATXI, Fig. 1), structurally the same scaffold but 
74 
lacking the epoxide, was reported to be mutagenic to a certain extent in vitro (Schrader et al., 2006).
