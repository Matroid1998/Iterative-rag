Whereas the liquidcrystal templating mechanism is a wellestablished approach in the case of 
silicabased mesoporous materials,10 the synthesis of elemental tetrel structures perforated with 
tunnels on the nanoscale remains challenging because of the difficulty in growing and 
organizing appropriate precursors. 69, 12 Notwithstanding the longrange ordering in the 
structure of mesoporous semiconducting frameworks of the already described systems, 
significant violations of the translational symmetry on the atomic scale are very common in their 
pores and, such defects would complicate the full structure description at atomic resolution, 
which is important for to understand the templating mechanism. 68 
Opened framework Zintl phases show strong structural similarities with mesoporous silica and 
are largely considered as precursors for nanostructured materials.
