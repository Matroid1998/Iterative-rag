Description:
An isotope of interest for electrocatalysis or battery research.

Text:
It can be applied at brilliant synchrotrons such as Petra III, ESRF, 
Spring8 or APS.2634 In contrast to MS, which is mainly used to study Fe57 and Sn119 isotopes, NFS 
can also be applied to a wide range of elements of interest for electrocatalysis or battery research, e.g. Ni6130, Ru9928 and Ir19335. Since NFS is not yet widely used in the electrochemistry community, we 
first present the similarities and differences compared to MS as a baseline for the discussion of the 
specific results on the HER catalyst. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023sk5sr ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000208841459 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
