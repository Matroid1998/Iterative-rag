Description:
A nucleophilic amino acid residue that reacts with sulfur(VI) fluorides.

Whilst photore
active functionalities can provide improved proteome cov
erage by potentially modifying any residue, the low levels of 
modification can limit their sensitivity (Figure 1Bii).2022 Re
active functionalities that enable robust, highyielding cova
lent capture of an expanded set of amino acid residues will 
diversify the proteome that can be targeted by covalent 
tools. Sulfur(VI) fluorides (SVIF) have emerged as a promising 
electrophilic group for the covalent modification of pro
teins, reacting with multiple nucleophilic amino acid resi
dues including Tyr, Lys, His, Arg, Ser and Thr (Figure 1Biii). 4,2332 SVIF functionalities can achieve a balance of broad 
protein reactivity alongside high yields of modification.
