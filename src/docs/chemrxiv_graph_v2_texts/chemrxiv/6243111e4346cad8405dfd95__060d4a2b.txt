Interestingly, more than a thousand compounds have been isolated from marine fungi with a 
66 
wide range of bioactivities including antiviral, anticancer, and antibacterial activities 17. 67 
Even though only one bioactive compound, cyclosporine A, has been approved for clinical use 
68 
in the market. This might be attributed to problems in the optimization methods or the screening 
69 
approaches of natural products discovery 18. 70 
Studying the marinederived fungi has been started around two centuries ago when the first 
71 
fungal species, Sphaeria posidoniae (Halotthia posidoniae) was reported on a rhizome of the 
72 
marine grass Posidonia oceanica in 1846 19.
