ple, the introduction of cavitycontaining MOCs endows the re
sulting gels with the ability for selective encapsulation and re
lease of guest molecules.23 The combination of dynamic coor
dination bonding of MOCs with the polymer flexibility affords 
the gel network with photoswitchable topologies and respon
siveness.2426 Recently we reported the fabrication of wet gels 
with hierarchical porous structures by coordinatively linking 
cuboctahedral MOPs, Rh2(bdc)212 (HRhMOP; bdc  ben
zene1,3dicarboxylate), with bidentate linkers, bix (1,4
bis(imidazol1ylmethyl)benzene).2728 The high thermal stabil
ity of HRhMOP results in gels that are able to withstand the 
desolvation process to form the corresponding aerogels with in
tact accessible MOP cavities. Despite these achievements, it is 
still challenging to further characterize and control the porosity 
in these amorphous gel materials.
