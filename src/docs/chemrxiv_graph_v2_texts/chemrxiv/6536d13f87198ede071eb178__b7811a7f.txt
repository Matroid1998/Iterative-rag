Description:
Require activation for use as substrates in some Ni-catalyzed electrochemical reactions.

Text:
For example, Sevov and coworkers reported an overcharge protection method using redoxactive 
shuttles and a dynamic ligand exchange method using a mixture of Nligand and Pligand to 
control the Ni redox states in the XEC reactions between aryl halides and secondarytertiary alkyl 
halides.3133 Recently, Weix and coworkers reported a dualligand strategy to optimize the 
selectivity of Nicatalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions at high temperatures.3435 Some Ni
catalyzed electrochemical XEC reactions using conventional catalysts and under mild conditions 
were also reported, but these methods require activated alkyl halide substrates, such as
