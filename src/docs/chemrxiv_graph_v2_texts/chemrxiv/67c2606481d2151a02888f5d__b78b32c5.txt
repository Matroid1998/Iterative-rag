Description:
A catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction that requires cations in the electrolyte.

Text:
Optimization of electrochemical systems such as electrolyzers for CO2 conversion involves
considering the elementary reactions occurring on the catalyst surface and the tuning of
multiphysical transport processes 1. While catalyst optimization has seen significant
advancements guided by binding energy descriptors and volcano plots 2, the intricate
multiscale nature of the catalystelectrolyte interface known as microenvironment re
mains to be elucidated 35. Engineering the microenvironment is especially relevant in
electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) as the reaction cannot occur on Cu, Ag and Au
if cations are not present in the electrolyte 68.

Description:
Higher concentrations of electrolyte cations favor CO formation at mildly reductive potentials.

Text:
On Ag and Au, higher concentrations
of electrolyte cations favor CO formation at mildly reductive potentials, but at strongly
negative potentials, they adversely impact cell performance, decreasing the CO Faradaic
efficiencies 9 and hampering device stability due to salt precipitation 10, 11. The na
ture of the alkali cation also impacts current densities, with higher values obtained with
increasing atomic number 12. Descriptors such as cations hydrated size 13 and acidity
14 were considered to rationalize the observed behavior. Other larger organic cations
also promote eCO2R in aqueous electrolytes by modulating the double layer thickness and
strength 15. However, there is a lack of robust tools for designing microenvironments
that optimize the operating conditions for eCO2R.
