Description:
A catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction that requires cations in the electrolyte.

Text:
Optimization of electrochemical systems such as electrolyzers for CO2 conversion involves
considering the elementary reactions occurring on the catalyst surface and the tuning of
multiphysical transport processes 1. While catalyst optimization has seen significant
advancements guided by binding energy descriptors and volcano plots 2, the intricate
multiscale nature of the catalystelectrolyte interface known as microenvironment re
mains to be elucidated 35. Engineering the microenvironment is especially relevant in
electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) as the reaction cannot occur on Cu, Ag and Au
if cations are not present in the electrolyte 68.
