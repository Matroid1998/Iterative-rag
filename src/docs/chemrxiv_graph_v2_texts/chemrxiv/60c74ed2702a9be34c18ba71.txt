Description:
An indole alkaloid that binds to opioid receptors and represents an atypical opioid ligand with distinct signaling properties.

Text:
In the U.S., the use of the dry leaf 
material, known as kratom, has been on the rise in the last decade, along with the number of 
anecdotal reports that point to the efficacy of kratom in a range of disorders with limited 
therapeutic options, including opioid dependence, treatmentresistant depression, anxiety, and 
pain syndromes.510 A number of alkaloids in this plant, including mitragynine (MG) and its 
oxidation product 7hydroxymitragynine (7OH, Fig. 1), have been found to bind to opioid 
receptors and represent novel molecular scaffolds for the development of opioid receptor 
modulators.11,12 Mitragynine, as an indole alkaloid, shows no structural resemblance to 
traditional morphinetype compounds and represents an atypical opioid ligand with distinct 
signaling properties and physiological effects compared to clinically used opioid analgesics.

Description:
A partial MOR agonist with a potential bias for G protein signaling.

Text:
For 
example, we have shown that mitragynine is a partial MOR agonist with a potential bias for G 
protein signaling (showing no arrestin2 recruitment) in cellbased assays.13,14 Further, we have 
found that 7OH is a more potent partial MOR agonist compared to mitragynine, and that it acts 
as a potent analgesic in mice.13,14 The relative activities of mitragynine and 7OH are highly
