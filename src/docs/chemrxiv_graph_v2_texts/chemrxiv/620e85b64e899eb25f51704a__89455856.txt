Description:
Used in CVD processes to produce high-quality coatings with growth rate enhancement.

Text:
The addition of Cl to the SiC CVD processes has been reported to not only increase 
the growth rate but also prevent the formation of Si droplets in the gas phase. The stronger 
SiCl bonds (400 kJmol)3 can suppress the formation of weaker SiSi bonds (226 kJmol)3,4. In 
terms of the Csource precursor, branched and small hydrocarbons such as ethylene or 
propane are often used since they can produce highquality SiC coatings and are available at 
high purities. As in many polycrystalline materials, the physical and chemical properties of 3CSiC 
coatings are dependent on the crystalline orientation. It has been shown that the Vickers 
microhardness of 111oriented 3CSiC films, i.e. films in which the (111) planes were 
aligned parallel to the surface, was higher than those 110oriented5.
