Description:
A highly potent substance that complicates law enforcement and public health responses due to its presence in complex drug samples.

Fentanyl analogs have been some of the more problematic drugs of abuse this past decade 1. Historically, authorities scheduled fentanyl analogs individually, which allowed for slightly 
modified and unscheduled variants to be distributed faster than they could be controlled 2. While 
blanket scheduling of fentanyl analogs by governing bodies like the United States Drug 
Enforcement Administration have helped limit the rise of new modified versions 3, their high 
potency has allowed them to permeate the drug supply chain as components in increasingly 
complex samples 4, complicating both law enforcement and public health responses 1,5,6. Underlying these societal challenges is a fundamental measurement issuefentanyl 
analogs are difficult to unambiguously discriminate with analytical techniques typically found in 
forensic laboratories.
