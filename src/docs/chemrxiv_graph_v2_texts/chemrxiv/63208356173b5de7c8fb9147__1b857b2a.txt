Description:
A component of the solid-electrolyte interface formed at the Mg anode.

have shown that the salt anion ClO4 is chemically
reduced at the Mg anode in carbonatecontaining solvents, forming a solidelectrolyte inter
face (SEI) consisting of Mghalides, MgO, Mg(OH)2, MgCO3, and Mg(ROCO2)2.11
Second, short circuits are induced by nonuniform Mg growth, which can be further sub
divided into hemispherical,12 porous13 or dendritic14 growth morphologies.9 Hemispherical
3D particles with different shapes have been detected in TFSIbased electrolytes as a function
of the applied current density.12 In an Mg(TFSI)2 salt electrolyte with MgCl2 as additive,
continuous stripping and plating leads to fracturing and reformation of the SEI layer, re
sulting in large effective current densities at the respective fracture sites and inhomogeneous
Mg deposition.13 Through this mechanism, hemispherical deposits are further degraded to
porous morphologies and trapped sediments that are irreversibly lost for cycling.
