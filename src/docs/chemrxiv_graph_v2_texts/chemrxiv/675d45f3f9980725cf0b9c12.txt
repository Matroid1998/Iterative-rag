Description:
A candidate for totally substituting chlorine dioxide in TCF bleaching sequences but causes depolymerisation of pulp carbohydrates.

Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences may 
perform better environmentally but have suffered from technical limitations such as 
insufficient brightness, poor brightness stability, or high cost (Rennel 1995). Among TCF 
chemicals, ozone is a candidate for totally substituting chlorine dioxide but provokes an 
inevitable depolymerisation of the pulp carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicelluloses). Today, the cellulose degree of polymerisation (DP) is generally considered the main 
parameter for kraft fibre strength prediction. Although various DPstrength correlations 
have been established in the past, there is no such thing as a unique linear trend 
encompassing the large diversity of chemicals affecting cellulose integrity. In fact, some 
chemical treatments would target weak spots in the fibres (ie. kinks or curls). Derivatisation 
reactions (e.g.
