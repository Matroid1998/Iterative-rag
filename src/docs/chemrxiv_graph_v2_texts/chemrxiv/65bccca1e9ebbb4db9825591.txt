Organosulfur compounds have been widely utilized in organic synthesis, 
material science, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry.1 Among different types 
of sulfurcontaining compounds, aryl fluorosulfates can serve as triflate surrogates in 
transitionmetal catalyzed coupling reactions2 (e.g. SuzukiMiyaura coupling, 
BuchwaldHartwig coupling, Negishi coupling), Substitution reactions3 and other 
reactions.4 More importantly, aryl fluorosulfates have been successfully used in 
chemical biology and drug discovery, including latestage drug functionalization,5
