Description:
Undergo difunctionalization transformations for the synthesis of complex alkyl chlorides.

Text:
The multifaceted reactivity of alkyl chlorides makes them important 
building blocks for the assembly of architecturally complex C(sp3)
rich molecules (Figure 1A)1. Despite their wellrecognized utilities, 
methods to access alkyl chlorides directly from readily available rea
gents remain rare2, beyond classical syntheses from Markovnikov ad
ditions to alkenes3 and substitution reactions of alcohols4. One area 
that has resulted in the evolution of new technologies for the synthe
sis of complex alkyl chlorides has been transformations based on the 
difunctionalization of alkenes. In the 1950s, Meerwein and cowork
ers developed a radicalbased approach to alkyl chloride synthesis 
through the arylchlorination of alkenes (Figure 1B)5a, b.

Description:
Electronically diverse compounds used in a catalyzed arylchlorination reaction.

Text:
For example, we found 
that two copperbased catalysts were optimal for azidoarylation13, 
but a ruthenium photocatalyst in combination with an iron group 
transfer catalyst were preferable for the aryl chlorination of vinyl bo
ronic esters14. We questioned whether our dual catalysis strategy could be engi
neered to accommodate a range of electronically diverse alkenes to
wards a broadly applicable arylchlorination reaction, during which 
the formation of the carbonchlorine bond proceeds exclusively 
through a catalyzed group transfer pathway rather than radical cou
pling or carbocation pathways, which define other processes9, 15.
