Description:
An elastomeric polymer used in blends to reduce elastic modulus.

2, 3 Semiconducting polymers utilise 
conjugation along the polymer backbone to allow delocalised charge carriers to travel between electrodes in a 
device, however they still exhibit a high elastic modulus when compared to the most flexible parts of skin (MPa 
vs kPa).4, 5 Many approaches have been successfully carried out to circumvent this issue,6 and one proven 
strategy is blending the semiconducting polymer with an elastomeric polymer that exhibits a lower elastic 
modulus.7 Notable examples are blends with polymer systems such as crosslinked poly(dimethylsiloxane) 
(PDMS),8, 9 paraffin,10 poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA,11 poly(styreneethylenebutylenestyrene) (SEBS),12, 13 
and butyl rubber.14 The best performing blends, that exhibit high charge carrier mobility when submitted to high 
strain, show large phase separation due to incompatibility between the two polymer systems.
