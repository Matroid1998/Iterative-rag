Description:
Involved in elimination and autocatalytic decomposition processes.

Text:
The first theoretical
analysis of the decomposition mechanism for RDX was conducted by Melius and Binkley8 at the MP4 level of
theory. They found that the NN homolytic cleavage in an RDX molecule is the primary decomposition pathway
with a dissociation energy of 48 kcalmol. Harris and Lammertsma9 calculated the potential energy surface at the
B3LYP631G level of theory and identified that the NNO2 and CH bonds in RDX are fragile. A mechanism is
proposed to initiate the decomposition by NN bond cleavage and propagate by H atom transfer. A detailed
decomposition mechanism was established by Patidar et al.10, including HONO elimination, NNO2 homolysis,
reactions with NO, autocatalytic decomposition via HONO and ONNO2 addition, and hydrogen abstraction via
NO.
