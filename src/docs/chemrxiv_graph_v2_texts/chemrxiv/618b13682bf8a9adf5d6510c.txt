Description:
Forms strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding.

Text:
ANFs can have strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, 
aromatic and van der Waals interactions with the surrounding polymer matrix, which lead to their 
exceptional strength and stiffness.30 ANFs are prepared by treating industrially produced Kevlar 
in a basic solution which enables the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network as well as partial 
hydrolysis of the amide linkages, resulting in rigid and nanometer sized polymeric fibers. This 
solution can be used as a dispersion in a solvent or to obtain ANF pulp by precipitating the fibers 
from these solutions. Previous work has shown that a small amount of ANFs in a polymer matrix
