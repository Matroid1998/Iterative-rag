Description:
An ionic compound with a structure dominated by alternating divalent NH2 anions and monovalent Li cations.

The large
fluctuations observed in the top layers of the surfaces allow a series of reac
tions to take place resulting in the final release of N2 and H2 molecules. Once
the flux of reactants is stopped the catalyst reverts to its initial conditions. Results
Reactantinduced dynamics of the surface
As a catalyst Li2NH16 is rather unusual since it is an ionic compound. In
fact, its structural arrangement is dominated by the need to alternate divalent
NH2anions and monovalent Li cations (Fig. 1a) in order to establish local
charge neutrality. The experimentally reported defective antifluorite structure
does reflect this building principle17,18,19.
