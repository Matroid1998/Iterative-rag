Description:
An atom with unique properties that has garnered increased attention in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Functional group (FG), an atom or a group of atoms that has 
similar chemical properties whenever it occurs in different 
compounds, is a cornerstone concept in fundamental organic 
chemistry.1,2 In medicinal chemistry and related areas, FGs 
usually play several important roles, being responsible not only 
for the chemical transformations of organic molecules, but also for 
establishing specific ligandtarget interactions and improving 
physicochemical parameters  key desirable features in drug 
design.3 Examples of the classical FGs most often occurring in 
medicinal chemistry include the derivatives of carboxylic acids 
(i.e., amides and esters), ethers, amines, or halogens.4 For the 
last decade, increased attention to fluorinated moieties5 was 
observed due to the unique properties of the Fluorine atom.
