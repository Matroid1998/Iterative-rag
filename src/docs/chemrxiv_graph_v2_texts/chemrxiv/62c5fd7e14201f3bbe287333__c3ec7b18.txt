Description:
A major constituent of cannabis synthesized from cannabigerolic acid.

Text:
Cannabigerol (CBG, 1, Figure 1) is often referred to as the 
mother of phytocannabinoids (pCBs) since most of the pCBs 
in the cannabis plant, including 9tetrahydrocannabinol 
(9THC, 3) and cannabidiol (CBD, 4) are synthesized from 
the 
related 
cannabigerolic 
acid 
(CBGA, 
2).1 
Phytocannabinoids demonstrated beneficial effects in the 
treatment of pain, cancer, asthma, and arthritis,24 and while 
most research has been focused on major constituents 9
THC and CBD, CBG is increasingly being used for medicinal 
purposes owing to its nonpsychotropic behavior and wide 
range of pharmacological effects.5 It was postulated that 
CBG mimics the endocannabinoids due to its versatility in 
physiological function;6 however, conclusive mechanistic 
work is still required in this regard.
