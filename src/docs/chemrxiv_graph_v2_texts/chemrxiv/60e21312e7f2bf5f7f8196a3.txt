Occupy the pores of NMDA receptors under resting conditions.

This observation is 
what we presently know as synaptic plasticity, which depicts the capacity of synapsis to strengthen 
or weaken in time 2. Presently, our view of memory formation is dominated by longterm 
changes in synaptic communication. This effect is accepted to be bidirectional; longterm 
potentiation (LTP) as a longlasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons and long
term depression (LTD), in which case the extent of transmission between neurons is weakened. In 
summary, LTP and LDP are accepted as the biomolecular mechanism that underlies memory 
acquisition 3. The structure of how LTP operates starts up with specific triggers. Under the resting condition, 
the pores of NMDA (NmethylDaspartate) receptors are occupied with Mg2 ions.
