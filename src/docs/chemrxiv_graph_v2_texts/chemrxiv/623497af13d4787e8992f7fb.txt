Description:
Coupled to cavity modes that can modify the symmetry of the groundstate wavefunction.

We
apply both methods to the analysis of several paradigmatic
systems, including the groundstate polaritonic structure of
formaldehyde coupled to cavity modes that can modify the
symmetry of the groundstate wavefunction, and the polari
tonic potential energy surfaces of the magnesium hydride ion
coupled to a lossy photonic mode. We also compute the pho
ton occupation of groundstates obtained from NHCQED
CIS in the ultrastrong coupling regime for a variety of loss
rates, showing qualitative agreement with analysis found in
