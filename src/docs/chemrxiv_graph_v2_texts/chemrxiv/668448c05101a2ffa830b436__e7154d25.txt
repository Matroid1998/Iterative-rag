With a

remarkable combination of high theoretical energy density, costeffectiveness, and the 
5 
widespread availability of sulfur, LiS batteries stand out as a promising contender for the next 
6 
generation of energy storage solutions.14 The theoretical energy density of LiS batteries have a 
7 
fivefold increase compared to that of conventional LIBs, positioning them as an optimal choice 
8 
for both electric vehicles and gridscale energy storage applications.5 The exceptional energy 
9 
density of LiS batteries is predominantly attributed to sulfur serving as the cathode active 
10 
material, boasting a theoretical capacity of 1675 mAhgsulfur, significantly surpassing traditional 
11 
cathode materials like cobalt, nickel, and manganese oxides used in LIBs.5 Furthermore, sulfurs 
12 
nontoxic nature and abundant supply make it an attractive and sustainable choice for energy 
13 
storage applications.1, 6 In essence, the remarkable energy density inherent in LiS batteries 
14 
confers practical viability to their integration into energy storage systems.
