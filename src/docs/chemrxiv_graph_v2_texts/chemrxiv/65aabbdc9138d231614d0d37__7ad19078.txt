Description:
Identified as ROMP monomers suitable for further study due to their functional properties.

Text:
Recent detailed studies of the mechanism4 and the effects of the exo
norbornene monomer structure on the rate of propagation and degree of livingness of these 
polymerizations58 have led to new insights that may guide the design of nextgeneration initiator 
and monomer classes. For example, Matson and coworkers58 have suggested that the HOMO 
energy levels of exoNBs correlate with their G3initiated ROMP propagation rate. Inspired by 
this work, and seeking synthetically accessible, functional monomers that do not compromise 
polymerization kinetics and controlled polymerization behavior, we identified tricyclononenes 
(TCN) and tricyclononadienes (TCND) as ROMP monomers ripe for further study (Figure 1).
