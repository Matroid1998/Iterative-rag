Description:
Known for its structural, electronic, and chemical properties similar to Pd.

Text:
Pt and Pd are well known for their close similarity in their 
structural, electronic, and chemical properties, e.g., in lattice constant or number of delectrons.17 
Nevertheless, there are distinct differences in their surface properties, such as alloy formation, the
