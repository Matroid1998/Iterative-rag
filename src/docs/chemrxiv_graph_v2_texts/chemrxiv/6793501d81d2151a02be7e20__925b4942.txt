Description:
Involves successive contractions and hybridization changes in phase transitions to diamondlike structures.

and context. The change from 2D Graphiticlike carbon to 3D Diamondlike structure (G2D) involves 
physical and chemical mechanisms that have been studied both experimentally and at 
different levels of modeling over the last 25 years. In 1999, Fayos showed that successive 
contractions of graphite in different directions, accompanied with C(sp2) to C(sp3) 
hybridization change simulate G2D phase transition 1. Recently we proposed to broaden the 
G2Dlike changes approach to be initiated by i the puckering of the atomic planar G layers 
by driving selected carbon atoms into offplane positions on the one hand, and ii a 
rationalized interlayer insertion of extra C to enforce the 3D structure, on the other hand (cf. 2 and therein cited works).
