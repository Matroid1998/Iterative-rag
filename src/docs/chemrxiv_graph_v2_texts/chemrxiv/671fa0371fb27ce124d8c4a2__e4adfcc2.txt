Description:
Display high extensibility characteristic of polymers in the rubbery state.

Text:
Silicone vitrimers constitute a unique class of polymers that can combine the high extensibility of 
elastomers with the selfhealing and reprocessability properties of covalent adaptive networks. 16 These 
combined features arise from highly mobile poly(siloxane) networks that contain reversible dynamic 
covalent bonds in their molecular structure. Because the glass transition temperature of poly(siloxanes) 
lies well below room temperature, silicones display the characteristic high extensibility of polymers in 
the rubbery state. 3, 4 Dynamic covalent bonds that rely on associative interactions allows the covalent 
network to adapt its topology while maintaining a constant density of crosslinks. Several types of 
dynamic covalent bonds have been exploited to synthesize silicone vitrimers.

Description:
Contain dynamic bonds that undergo boronic ester exchange.

Examples include 
silicones containing dynamic bonds that undergo boronic ester exchange 6, 7, transamination of 
vinylogous urethanes, 4 and transthioesterification of Meldrums acids. 3 However, the selfhealing and 
reprocessability enabled by such dynamic bonds are typically achieved at the cost of the mechanical 
strength and creep resistance of the vitrimer. The tradeoff between the mechanical strength and the selfhealing ability of vitrimers has motivated 
research on strategies to optimize such antagonistic properties. This effort has led to the development 
of vitrimers combining multiple types of crosslinkers, 812 reinforced with particle fillers 1315 or featuring 
novel architectures at the meso or macroscales.
