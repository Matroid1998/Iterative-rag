Description:
A representative of active substrates for Mnporphyrin-catalyzed fluorination.

Text:
Lastly, we obtain potential energy curves along the 
reaction coordinate for CH fluorination, for the simplest cases of 
cyclohexane and piperidine (representatives of active and non
active substrates, respectively, for Mnporphyrincatalyzed 
fluorination) to understand why fluorination of druglike 
compounds with heteroatoms does not occur as simply as 
fluorination of hydrocarbons. 2. Reaction Mechanism 
We accept in this work the reaction mechanism suggested in prior 
studies12, 7879 for aliphatic CH fluorination with Mn complexes. In the resting state (1), the catalyst consists of Mn(III) coordinated 
to tetramesitylporphyrin (TMP) in the equatorial plane and 
fluoride in an axial position, with the other axial position being 
vacant (Figure 1). Oxidation of this resting state intermediate 
results in a highly reactive oxomanganese species (2), 
Mn(V)O(TMP)F 
(Figure 
1).
