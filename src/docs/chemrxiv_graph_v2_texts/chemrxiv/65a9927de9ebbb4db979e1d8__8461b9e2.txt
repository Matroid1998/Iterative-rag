Protective layer used in stability studies.

of a GE encapsulant further enables a leap in 
stability over previous studies involving nanometre thin TiO2,29 
PEI27 or Pt protective layers.46 The 0.51 mm thick hydrophobic 
coating avoids pinholes and crossplane moisture infiltration, 
whereas polymer interactions between PCE10 and the epoxy 
resin produce a tight seal around the sample edges, preventing 
the lateral moisture degradation observed in perovskite 
photocathodes.37 While a gradual photocurrent decay is 
consistent with photovoltaic reports,33,39 the molecular 
tuneability of OSCs in terms of synthesis, functionalisation and 
donoracceptor combinations presents a wide scope for further 
performance improvements. Conclusion 
This work demonstrates the potential of organicbased PEC 
devices towards longterm water splitting and CO2 reduction.
