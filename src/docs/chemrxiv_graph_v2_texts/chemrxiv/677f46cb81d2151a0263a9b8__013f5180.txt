Description:
Poised to become the most crucial hydrocarbon feedstock for fuel and chemical synthesis.

Text:
In the foreseeable future, carbonbased fuels will continue dominating our energy consumption. Development of robust catalytic materials to meet our daily energy needs is arguably the most 
critical scientific and engineering challenge.17 Methane (CH4), as the primary component of 
natural gas, methane clathrates,8, 9 and shale gas,10 is poised to become the most crucial 
hydrocarbon feedstock for fuel and chemical synthesis, providing an economical alternative to the 
declining petroleum reserves. Despite the vast availability of methane, it requires a complex 
infrastructure for secure transportation, storage, and distribution, limiting efficient usage of the 
natural resources.
