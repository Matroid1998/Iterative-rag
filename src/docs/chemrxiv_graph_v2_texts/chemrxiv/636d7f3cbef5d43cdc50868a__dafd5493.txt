Description:
Completely unreactive to reductive dechlorination by green rust.

Text:
The extensive use of chlorinated hydrocarbons (especially chlorinated alkanes and alkenes; 
CAEs) as solvents, degreasers, drycleaning agents, and fumigants has resulted in localized 
contamination of soils and aquifers, particularly in regard to carbon tetrachloride (CT; CCl4), 
chloroform (CF; CHCl3), methylene chloride (DCM; CH2Cl2), 1,1,1trichloroethane (C2H3Cl3), 1,2
dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2), perchloroethene (PCE; C2Cl4), and trichloroethene (TCE; C2HCl3) 5153. Given the human health and ecotoxicity issues associated with CAEs, there has been a concerted 
effort to develop approaches for the remediation of CAE contaminated environments, often by means 
of reductive dechlorination to lesser or nonchlorinated products 54,55. Reductive dechlorination 
of CAEs by green rust is highly variable, with some, such as CT and hexachloroethane (C2Cl6) 
undergoing rapid reduction, and others such as chloromethane (CH3Cl) and chloroethane (C2H5Cl) 
being completely unreactive 28,47,48,5664.
