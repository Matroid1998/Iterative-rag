Description:
Associated with fluorescence lifetime changes in RAMOS cells upon B cell receptor knockout.

Text:
Recently, we observed 
that the knockout (KO) of the functional B cell receptor in 
RAMOS cells is associated with a decreased NAD(P)H 
fluorescence lifetime in comparison to wildtype (WT) RAMOS
