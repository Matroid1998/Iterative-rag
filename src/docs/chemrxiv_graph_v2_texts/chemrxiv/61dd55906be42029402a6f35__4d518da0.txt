Description:
A polymer that can be protonated by H2O.

Text:
In a second step, an intermolecular electron transfer oc
curs in which a neutral polymer chain donates an electron to the
protonated polymer chain, leaving a (positive) polaron on the un
protonated polymer chain. The formation of polaronic states is
conrmed by UVVisNIR spectroscopic measurements and EPR
and ENDOR measurements reveal the presence of unpaired elec
trons. Recent measurements on a related polymer, PCPDTBT
SO3K, which can be protonated by H2O, show similar results.12,13
Detailed insights into the effect of Brnstedtype acid complex for
mation of BCF on the doping of P3HT were obtained identifying
