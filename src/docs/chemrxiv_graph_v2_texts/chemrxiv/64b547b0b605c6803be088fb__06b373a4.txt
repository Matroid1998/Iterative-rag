Description:
Form layers that sandwich Mo atoms in trigonal-particle geometry.

This has led to particular progress in the detection
of NO2 1623, with the main competing platforms based on Mo
bearing sheets, i.e., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum dise
lenide (MoSe2), and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). All three enable
RToperable ultrasensitive gas sensors with ppb detection limits, high
selectivity, realtime response, and rapid onoff switching, which is due

to them sharing the same type of atomic structure. Mobearing TMDs
favor trigonalparticle geometry with Mo atoms sandwiched between
two layers of chalcogens. It results in electronic states at the valence
band maximum (VMB) capable of acting as electron donors upon ad
sorption of NO2 24.
