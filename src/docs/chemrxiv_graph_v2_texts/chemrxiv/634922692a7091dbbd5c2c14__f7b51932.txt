Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for capture and storage to reduce emissions.

Text:
Carbon dioxide capture and storage is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
meeting netzero emissions targets.1,2 A range of technologies are under development to meet 
the need for more energy efficient carbon capture. One promising strategy to improve on 
traditional aqueous amine technology is to use solid adsorbent materials for capture.35 In 
particular, installation of reactive amine or hydroxide functional groups within a porous 
scaffold such as a metalorganic framework or a porous silica brings about selective reactivity 
with CO2,610 with the porous scaffold providing a large surface area for hosting the reactive 
groups while maintaining channels for CO2 transport.
