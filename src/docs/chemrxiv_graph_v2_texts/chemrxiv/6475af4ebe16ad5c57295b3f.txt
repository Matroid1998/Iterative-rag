In 2022 more than 3 million tons of SiMG were produced while 
demand was substantially higher (3.53.75 million tonnes) lead
ing to 300 price increases to 6,0009,000t from 2,000
3,000t in 2021 3. Alone, China in 202021 accounted for 80 
of the 3 million tyr annual production, followed by Europe and 
the Americas. Nearly half (45) of the total demand originates 
from aluminum alloys, 35 from silicones, 15 from photo
voltaic cells, and 5 from the semiconductor industry 3. Driv
en by increasing demand for silicon from the solar photovoltaic 
industry, the market for SiPV has nearly doubled from 1.8 million 
tyr in 2010 4.
