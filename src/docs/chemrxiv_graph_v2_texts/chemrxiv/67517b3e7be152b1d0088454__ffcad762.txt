sian Blue (PB, Na02FeFe(CN)6) and its analogues (PBAs, Na02BB(CN)6 where B and
B are transition metals) are strong contenders for a very sustainable, sodium based battery
value chain.17,18 While the energy density of these materials is lower compared to lithiumion
batteries, their use will solve a lot of issues regarding the planned massive expansion of grid
storage solutions.9,19
On the atomic level, the lattice of Prussian Blue is made up of cyanide ligands, which
interconnect highspin, nitrogen coordinated iron atoms with lowspin carboncoordinated
iron atoms in an alternating fashion along all three spatial directions.2022 During the
(de)intercalation of charge carriers, such as sodium, both species of iron atoms are elec
trochemically active, with the Ccoordinated iron being reduced first.23,24 Recently, the dif
ferent stages of sodiation in Prussian Blue compounds are named after their characteristic
color, meaning the fully desodiated, half sodiated and fully sodiated compounds are de
