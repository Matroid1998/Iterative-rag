Description:
A U correction of 6 eV was applied to its f orbitals using the Dudarev formalism.

Text:
Calculations on EuAg4Sb2 were performed
in the unrestricted KohnSham formalism with the Eu spins
aligned ferromagnetically, and a U correction of 6 eV was
applied to the f orbitals of Eu using the Dudarev formalism
