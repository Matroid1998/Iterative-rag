Description:
Used in molecular clusters for exploring structure-property relationships.

Text:
Molecular silicon and silicongermanium clusters are 
attractive models for exploring such structureproperty re
lationships (Figure 1) due to their atomically precise struc
tures.712 Achieving synthetic control over their internal and 
peripheral chemical structure is a critical objective that 
must be met for such structureproperty studies to be exe
cuted.1324
