Description:
Used in supercritical CO2 technique for activation and purification processes.

In general, the purification and activation 
process often face some difficulties due to the potential for 
structural collapse and loss of crystallinity.1 Typically, the 
commonly used techniques for activation include thermal 
treatment, 
solventexchange 
(prior 
to 
evacuation 
evaporation), freeze drying, and supercritical CO2 
technique.1,2 In addition, there are some methods that are 
less common such as microwave heating,3 ultrasound,4 and 
ultravioletvisible (UVvis) irradiation.5 The most widely 
used method amongst all of these techniques is solvent
exchange, which entails replacing an evacuating solvent 
with another one that can easily be evacuated and 
evaporated without incurring permeant damages to the 
material.6 
As such, it is very crucial to understand the relationship 
between the properties of MOFs and the structural collapse 
during solvent removal. Intrinsic structural factors (e.g.
