Description:
A solvent used for cleaning substrates by ultrasonication.

Text:
To terminate the etch and remove any etchant remaining on 
the Sisurface, the wafers were immersed in a 5 HCl solution for 120 seconds and subsequently rinsed and dried 
using N2 gas. The mass loss from the wafers was found to be roughly 6 of the initial value. Before deposition of 
ceria, Sisubstrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in isopropanol for 10 minutes, rinsed with deionized water and 
dried in N2 gas at room temperature. For the reference samples, we utilized nontreated flat Siwafers as substrates.
