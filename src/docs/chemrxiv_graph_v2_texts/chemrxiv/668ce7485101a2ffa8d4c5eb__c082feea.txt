Description:
A chemically modified form of PBAT that participates in a Diels-Alder reaction to form a crosslinked network.

Those 
conventional methods yielded polyestergrafted polysaccharides with different levels of 
efficiency. Another more recent and relevant grafting strategies are based on click chemistry, i.e. quick and 
quantitative reactions, performed under mild conditions and producing inoffensive and easily 
removable byproducts 10. In a previous work, a thermally reversible network based on reversible 
and click DielsAlder (DA) reaction, from amylomaize starch (AMS) and PBAT was developed 
11. This was achieved after chemical modifications of AMS and PBAT, to synthesize AMS
maleimide and PBATdifuran, respectively, which were able to form a crosslinked network by 
DA reaction at 65 C. This network was successfully uncleaved by retro DA at higher 
temperatures12. Considering the cleavage kinetic, thiolMichael addition presents some strong advantages as 
one of the fastest click reactions.
