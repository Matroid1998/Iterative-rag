Description:
Forms lightweight alloys with low density when alloyed with magnesium.

Text:
In this 
63 
regard, alloying of AZseries Mg alloys with Li makes it possible to obtain lightweight alloys with 
64 
low density (density of ca. 1.3 gcm3) 79. The microstructure of binary Lirich Mg alloys 
65 
depends on the concentration of Li in the alloys 1012. At low lithium contents (below 5.7 wt. ), 
66 
the crystal structure of the formed alloys is a hexagonal closepacked (hcp) with the phase as a 
67 
solid solution of lithium in magnesium. At high lithium content (above 11.3 wt. ), the crystal 
68 
structure is bodycentered cubic (bcc) with the phase as a solid solution of magnesium in lithium. 69 
Magnesium alloys with a medium amount of Li have both hcp and bcc crystal structures 
70 
10,13,14.

Description:
Has a higher affinity to Al and Mg compared to Al's affinity to Mg.

Text:
The formation of the latter 
78 
two phases is more probable since the affinity of Li to Al and Mg is higher than that of Al to Mg.
