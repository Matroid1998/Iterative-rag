Description:
A class of compounds to which Nconfused porphyrin belongs.

Text:
Cobalt complex of Nconfused porphyrin 
(NCP), the first among carbaporphyrins,12, 13 quite effectively 
catalyses cyclopropanation reaction.14 On the other hand, the 
forced proximity of the (typically) aryl fragment to the metal 
centre within the macrocycle creates unique conditions that 
could facilitate its selective functionalisation.10, 15 Thus, NCP 
reacted with a cobalt source can get functionalised at the inner 
C(21) atom with an oxygen atom,16 cyano,17 2chlorovinyl,16 
methyl,18 or tolyl groups,19 depending on the reaction 
conditions. Here, the C(sp3)H activation and functionalisation 
of an carbon atom in ketones within metallocarbaporphyrins 
remain underexplored.

Description:
Structures with unique steric and electronic effects on the coordination sphere of encapsulated metal centers.

Text:
The 
structural 
rigidity 
and 
electronic 
properties 
of 
carbaporphyrins can impose unique steric and electronic effects 
on the coordination sphere of the encapsulated metal centre, 
potentially altering the typical reactivity patterns (or lack of 
such) observed for both the metal and the bound substrate, 
including ketoenol equilibrium in the case of the activated 
ketones. In this context, our research seeks to address this gap by 
systematically investigating the reactivity of a series of ketones 
confined within cobalt carbaporphyrin complexes. Through 
these studies, we aim to elucidate the mechanistic aspects of 
this confinement and its impact on the cobaltassisted 
activation and subsequent arylation of ketones with a 
carbaporphyrin fragment (azulene or pyrrole moiety), as well as 
the attached fragment behaviour towards the confining 
framework.
