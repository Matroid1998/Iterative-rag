Description:
Ternary compounds that are relatively unexplored due to the toxic nature of beryllium.

Text:
Ternary Metal Oxides (TMO) have received recent investigation for application in photonics due to properties of 
enhanced conductivity, tuneable optoelectronic behaviour and multiple oxidation state of oxygen inducing functional 
diversity such as spinel metalcobalt oxides for high performance supercapacitors or nitrogen doped TMOs inducing adjusted 
band structures for enhanced photocatalytic activity via bandgap reduction for increased optical absorption 1,2. Although 
TMO research has grown, ternary beryllium oxides have been relatively unexplored due to the toxic nature of beryllium 
inducing the chronic lung disease berylliosis and regulatory procedures for material access.

Ternary compounds investigated for optoelectronics applications.

Despite aforementioned 
challenges, beryllium has been ubiquitous in industries such as nuclear, aerospace, medical and manufacturing due to small 
atomic (112 pm) and ionic radii (45 pm) inducing strong covalent bond resultant material properties of low density (1.85 
gcm3), tensile strength exceeding 700 MPa, high melting point (1560 K), modulus of elasticity (303 GPa), neutron 
reflectivity and oxidative resistance. Motivated by the potential of ternary beryllium oxides for optoelectronics applications, 
BeSeO3 is investigated via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that operate by approximation of manyelectron 
wavefunction systems via electron density computation (Eq.1) with an associated local density approximation of the 
exchangecorrelation correction to account for electronelectron interactions 3,4,5.
