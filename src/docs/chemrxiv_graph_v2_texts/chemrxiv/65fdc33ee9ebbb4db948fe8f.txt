Description:
Used in coating to improve electron transfer in MoS2 due to its presence.

Text:
These advantages have made MoS2 one of the most studied anode materials of PIBs.10,1315 
A great deal of research attention has been directed towards enhancing the PIB performance of 
MoS2 by addressing issues such as poor electronic conductivity and structural instability. Carbon coating1618 and phase engineering (1T phase and 1T2H mixed phase)1922 can 
improve electron transfer owing to the presence of carbon and the metallic nature of the 1T 
phase (10100 S cm1),23 respectively.
