Description:
A short-lived (12 years) potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential of 28 times that of CO2 and the primary component of natural gas.

The increase in humaninduced methane emissions over the last 150 years has contributed to
33
climate change, and mitigating these emissions is an immediate target to limit the planetary
34
mean temperature rise to 1.5 C to 2.0 C above the preindustrial level this century.14
35
Methane, a shortlived (12 years) potent greenhouse gas with a 100year global warming
36
potential of 28 times that of CO2 is the primary component of natural gas commonly emitted
37
from the oil and natural gas (OG) industry.4 OG emissions are the second largest source
38
of methane emissions in the United States (US), and it is estimated that methane emissions
39
could be reduced by 75 from the OG sector globally by implementing already established
40
mitigation approaches, including leak detection and repair (LDAR).5
41
LDAR programs are implemented in the OG sector to monitor and identify equipment
42
component leaks (fugitive emissions) to reduce emissions through leak repairs.6,7 Current
43
regulations in the US and Canada require periodic groundbased LDAR using handheld
44
optical gas imaging (OGI) cameras or portable volatile organic compound analyzers (US

Although these approaches can precisely localize sources, they are laborintensive due to
48
their small scope of application (component level) compared to the extensive spatial scale
49
of OG infrastructure.
