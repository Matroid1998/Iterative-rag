Description:
Prochiral compounds that undergo enantioselective desymmetrization through C(sp2)H alkylation.

An additional level of difficulty arises when the CH bond 
functionalization in question results in the generation of a 
stereocenter and the issue of enantiocontrol. In 2015, one of our groups developed a simple strategy4 
for direct introduction of unfunctionalized alkyl groups into 
olefinic C(sp2)H bonds, not only enantioselectively but also 
without using directing group. This transformation utilizes 
airstable and inexpensive nitroalkanes (2) as the alkyl 
source under the influence of a bifunctional tertiary amino
urea derivative (4) as the catalyst (Scheme 1A). More spe
cifically, prochiral 2,2disubstituted cyclopentene1,3dio
nes (1) were desymmetrized enantioselectively through 
C(sp2)H alkylation. The generality of this strategy was sub
sequently demonstrated for the enantioselective desymme
trization of mesonorbornenoquinones.
