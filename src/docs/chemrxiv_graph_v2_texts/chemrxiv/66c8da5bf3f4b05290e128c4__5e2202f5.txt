Description:
A polymer that does not form well-defined micelles in aqueous solution.

Text:
However, unlike PVP and P(VPcoVA), the POxPOzi based amphiphilic ABA triblock 
copolymers form welldefined micelles in aqueous solution.2021 Previously, the latter have 
been explored in high drug loading polymeric nanoformulations with drug loadings of more 
than 50wt 20, 2229, as well as stabilization of drug nano and microparticles30. In the spring
andparachute model often described for ASDs, the ASD serves as the spring, while the in 
situ formed micelles serve as a parachute by increasing the apparent aqueous solubility of the 
drug. The drug loaded micelles can remain colloidally stable over a period of up to several
