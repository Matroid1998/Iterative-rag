Description:
An important resource that can have a significant impact on our climate if released into the atmosphere.

Text:
Natural gas consists mainly of methane,1 an important resource that can unfortunately have a 
significant impact on our climate if released into the atmosphere.2 Methane can, however, be used 
to produce another important base chemical methanol.

Description:
Used in the synthesis of methanol through the creation of syngas.

Text:
Methanol is currently synthesized from 
methane through the creation of syngas, a thermodynamically inefficient process, as it requires 
high temperatures and pressures to overcome the reaction energy of 206 kJmol in steam 
reforming.3,4 Due to the need for intermediate syngas creation, the onsite usage of methane at 
smaller and remote sources of methane is greatly hindered, and the methane at such remote sites 
is often simply flared, as its transport to other locations is not easily achieved.4,5 Methanol, 
however, can be stored and transported with much less effort, as it is a liquid under ambient 
conditions.

Description:
A hydrocarbon that can be converted to methanol with high selectivity challenges.

Text:
A direct and selective pathway from methane to methanol, usable at small and large 
scales, would therefore greatly decrease the environmental impact of remote methane sources, 
as well as methanolderived substances and methanolbased fuels. A key challenge is achieving 
high selectivity in the direct methane to methanol reaction. Burning methane is easy, stopping at 
methanol is not.6,7 
Recently, many advances in the field of methane activation have been made. Inspired by 
enzymes, many biomimetic, homogeneous catalysts have been designed811 to achieve the goal 
of high selectivity combined with high yield. However, industrially, heterogeneous catalysts 
provide many advantages.

Description:
A compound whose CH bond can be activated by metal oxo centers.

Text:
Two 
important design goals for a MOF catalyst for the selective conversion of methane to methanol 
are suggested by economics and prior work 1) the catalyst should be active under mild 
conditions16 and 2) the obtained methanol should be protected to prevent overoxidation.6 Metal
oxo centers are active species for the activation of the CH bond of methane and other alkanes10,17
22 and can be designed into a variety of MOF structures.

Description:
Involved in activation mechanisms in zeolites with metaloxo centers.

Text:
Also, the secondary interactions23,24 and 
geometric effects of the host system (sometimes called secondsphere effects) can be exploited 
to control reaction mechanisms in nanoporous materials as recently shown by Snyder et al.25 The 
mobility of the CH3 radical involved in many mechanisms for methane activation proved to be a 
key factor in the activity of zeolites incorporating metaloxo centers, which have already been 
shown to be active for continuous methane oxidation using N2O and H2O.26 
In MOFs, ironoxo centers (FeO) have been successfully incorporated into the Fe2(dobdc) family 
(FeMOF74, dobdc42,5dioxido1,4benzenedicarboxylate) and have been shown to be 
catalytically active towards CH bond cleavage in experiment and theory.27,28 For the case of 
ethane to ethanol conversion, this MOF exhibited a high selectivity due to the strong binding of 
the product to the open metal sites, resulting, however, in a low yield27,29 in both flowthrough and 
batch operation modes as the reactive sites become blocked by the strongly bound product.

Description:
A compound investigated for oxidation by metaloxo centers.

Text:
Many 
other systems incorporating metaloxo centers have since then been investigated for the oxidation 
of methane by computational means.3034 Also, our group recently investigated metaloxo species 
in MOFs for the activation of the CH bond by identifying structureactivity relationships in MOFs 
based on DFT calculations,35,36 screening a MOF database to identify promising MOF systems,37 
and investigating triazolate based MOFs with varying metals and anions theoretically.38,39
