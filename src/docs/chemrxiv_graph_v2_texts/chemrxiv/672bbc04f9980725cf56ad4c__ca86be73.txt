Description:
A symbol for molybdenum, used in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides.

The successful isolation of graphene from graphite along with the
discovery of its distinctive properties has attracted considerable inter
est in 2Dlayered materials 1. In recent years, remarkable progress
has been made in the exploration of these materials, evolving from fun
damental research to advanced materials engineering and the develop
ment of innovative technologies 25. A special place among 2D
layered materials belongs to semiconducting transitionmetal dichalco
genides (TMDs) containing molybdenum (Mo) such as MoS2, MoSe2,
and MoTe2 with the general formula MoX2, where X refers to a chalco
gen element. MoX2 monolayers possess a direct band gap in contrast
to graphene and offer unique physicochemical characteristics, paving
the way for their application in (opto)electronics, spintronics, electro
catalysis, sensing, and energy storage 415.

Description:
Exhibits sd5 hybridization in MoX2 sheets, where it is sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms.

Text:
MoX2 sheets share a similar hexagonal threelayered structure, char
acterized by a common bonding configuration, in which the Mo atoms
are sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms 1. In this ar
rangement, Mo exhibits sd5 hybridization, while X atoms adopt sp3 hy
bridization. Consequently, these monolayers feature outwardprojecting
orbitals of the same type, leading to generally similar surface interac
tion mechanisms 16. The lack of coordinately unsaturated surface
sites makes their surfaces chemically inert and causes external interac
tions to be driven by van der Waals (vdW) forces 1727.
