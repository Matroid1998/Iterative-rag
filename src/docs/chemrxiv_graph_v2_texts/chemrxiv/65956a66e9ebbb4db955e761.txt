Description:
Compounds that can achieve chemoselectivity in acylations.

Text:
Most dendrimers reported have simple structures with one type of branch cell and one type of surface group or a statistical distribution of 
surface groups, while welldefined dendrimers with a welldefined heterogenous surface are mainly limited to peptide dendrimers made by 
solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) 2326. There are two different strategies that can be applied for synthesizing dendrimers with a welldefined surface chemistry; symmetrybreak
ing reactions on a preformed symmetrical dendrimer (which in essence is a protective groupfree synthesis) or synthesis by convergent 
synthesis involving suitably protected building blocks. Symmetrybreaking reactions on preformed dendrimers such as aminoterminated 
dendrimers reflects the fact, that it is possible to achieve chemoselectivity in acylations on polyamines (see for example reference 2729 
and references therein).
