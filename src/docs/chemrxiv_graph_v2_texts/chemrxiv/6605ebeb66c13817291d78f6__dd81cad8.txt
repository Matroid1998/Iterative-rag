opening, pyridineboryl radical transfer19,20 and photochemical excitation of the strained bridging bond to 
30 
access the corresponding diradical21,22. Employing these strategies has led to the development of many 
31 
unique transformations and, as a consequence, BCBcontaining compounds have become cemented as 
32 
valuable tools in areas such as bioconjugation23,24 and in the assembly of challenging arene isosteres10,11,25. 33 
However, in order to find new applications and access unexplored regions of chemical space, alternative 
34 
reactivity modes that harness the unique properties of BCBs are required. 35
