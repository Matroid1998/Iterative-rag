Description:
Stable compounds used in asymmetric copper-catalyzed cross-couplings.

Text:
Consequently, a range of groups 
have reported the asymmetric coppercatalyzed crosscouplings of readily available and stable aryl boronic acids, organoboronate 
esters and azoles with benzylic radicals and amide radicals derived from alkylarenes, benzylic halides, or Katritzky salts (Figure
