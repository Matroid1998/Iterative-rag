Description:
Stored in metal hydrides at low pressures and moderate temperatures.

Text:
Solidstate hydrogen storage in metal alloys holds the potential to outper
form conventional (liquidcompressed) methods on accounts of volumetric ca
pacity, safety, and durability.1, 2, 3 One major advantage of hydrogen storage
in metal hydrides is their energyecient way of storing hydrogen at relatively
5
low pressures, and moderate temperatures eliminating the need for liquefac
tion or compression. The metalhydrogen bond oers the advantage of a high
volumetric hydrogen density under moderate pressures.4, 5 Despite signicant
performance improvements in metal hydrides over the past two decades, their
practical application is hindered by the unattainable thermodynamic and kinetic
10
properties at ambient conditions for economical viability.6, 7 The storage prop
erties of metal alloys are strongly related to the hydrogen pressure, temperature,
and the alloy compositions.

Description:
The content in a material changes with pressure and temperature as illustrated by the PCT isotherm.

Text:
This presents a vast chemical space that needs to
be explored to discover suitable solidstate hydrogen storage materials. The PCT analysis is employed to assess the suitability of an alloy for hydro
15
gen storage. The PCT isotherm, also known as a pressurecompositionisotherm
(PCI) curve, illustrates how the hydrogen content in a material changes with
pressure and temperature. The PCT isotherms of an alloy are determined by
conducting thermogravimetric and volumetric measurements with Sieverttype
apparatus.8 They provide crucial information, like maximum reversible storage
20
capacity, hydride phase transition, and the equilibrium plateau pressure. The
length of plateau determines how much hydrogen can be stored reversibly.
