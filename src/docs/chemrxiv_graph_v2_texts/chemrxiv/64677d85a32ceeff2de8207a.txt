Description:
Forms linear chains known as novolacs through condensation polymerization.

Text:
Phenolic 
resins are commonly used as CC composite matrix precursors due to their relatively high char 
yield, or retained percentage of mass after pyrolysis, of about 55, which reduces the number PIP 
cycles required to achieve a dense product acceptable for service 1. Phenolic resins polymerize 
via a condensation reaction to produce linear phenol chains known as novolacs. Novolacs can be 
ground into a powder and mixed with a hardener to form a highly branched network of phenols 
called Bakelite, which is a carbon matrix precursor 2. However, the insoluble and infusible nature 
of Bakelite and the complex chemical and structural changes that occur during pyrolysis make 
experimental characterization and process optimization difficult.
