Description:
Compounds with limited reliable synthetic access.

In this context, 
the 6substituted indolo3,2bcarbazole scaffold was chosen as the synthetic target to build novel relevant AhR 
ligands (Figure 1B). In this regard, the 6formyl derivative (FICZ) displays highly potent and selective activity, but 
suffers from a long synthetic access 7 with limited options for chemical diversification. Furthermore, FICZ is 
phototoxic, lacks proper druglike characteristics due to its CHO group, and its therapeutic projection is unsuitable 
despite being the most used AhR probe. In general, although the preparation of symmetric 6,12disubstituted 
indolocarbazoles has been thoroughly studied 1, the reliable synthetic access to 6substituted indolocarbazoles
