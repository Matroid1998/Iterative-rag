believed to revolutionise the battery industry by substitut

ing the liquid electrolyte in todays batteries (which are

flammable and unstable under temperature extremes) with a
24
solid inflammable material.1 However, interfacial instability
25
and resistance are among the most difficult challenges facing
26
SSEs2 This includes synthesis conditions and sample pu
27
rity that contribute to the formation of the Liresistant solid
28
electrolyte interphase layer and the growth of lithium den
29
drites. The most critical challenge against the broad adop

tion of SSEs is interfacial instability at the lithium metal in

Description:
A metal whose diffusion in solid structures can be simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics.

Text:
The thermodynamics of a number of SSE materials
32
at the lithium metal interface were examined by Zhu et al.3
33
Several works, such as the seminal work by Mo et al.,4
34
s.abbasdeakin.edu.au
have established the utility of ab initio molecular dynamics
35
(AIMD) in simulating the diffusion of lithium in solid struc
36
tures.

Description:
Diffuses in liquid and polymer electrolytes.

Text:
The key to the capability of AIMD in such simula
37
tions is that it applies density functional theory (DFT) for the
38
computation of the atomic forces, rather than using empirical
39
force fields in classical molecular dynamics approaches that
40
have traditionally been the workhorse simulators of lithium
41
diffusion in liquid and polymer electrolytes.5
42
However, the accuracy advantage brought by AIMD is ac
43
companied by a scalability disadvantage there is a harsh
44
limit to the system size that can be simulated, given that DFT
45
computations scale as N 3 where N is the system size (such
46
as the number of atoms), making it infeasible to model sim
47
ulation cells with more than 500 atoms for a few hundred
48
picoseconds.
