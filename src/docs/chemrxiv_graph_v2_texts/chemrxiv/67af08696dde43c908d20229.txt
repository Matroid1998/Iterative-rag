Supercritical fluids are an environmentally friendly and efficient alternative to traditional
chemical solvents used in various industrial processes.1 Among the most widely utilized
supercritical fluids is carbon dioxide (scCO2), which is characterized by its safety, inertness,
nonflammability, ease of recycling, and high solvation potential for nonpolar compounds. With a critical temperature of 304 K and a pressure of 73.8 bar, scCO2 is a costeffective fluid
and particularly wellsuited for processing thermally sensitive drugssolutes, foodrelated,
