Description:
Used in peptide chemistry for isosteric replacement of CO with sulpha analogues.

Text:
The scientific introduction of the term isostere by Langmuir in 1919 1 and its application to 
biological activity by Friedman in 1951 2 is one of the cornerstone concepts in modern MedChem 
3. Despite the seeming simplicity of the concept, its practical using sometimes seriously limited by 
synthetic accessibility of corresponding speculatively generated isosterestructures. As an example 
of the statement the benzene isosteres story could be highlighted 4. Therefore, the generating of 
isosteric structures, which could be easily obtained by the changing of readily accessible starting 
materials using the general approach to parent structure is promising for modern MedChem. For 
example, the isosteric replacement of CO with SO2 was widely used in peptide chemistry via 
exchanging of the corresponding amino acids to sulpha analogues 5,6.

Description:
Considered for isosteric replacement in Biginellitype compounds.

Accordingly, our amazing has been even more when only two papers 
described the synthesis of thiadiazine1,1dioxides from sulfamide via a Biginellilike approach, 
while using nonclassical cyclization partners. In one, the thiadiazine1,1dioxides core was 
obtained using the recyclization of an 8member adduct of 2 molecules NH2SO2NH2 and 2 molecules 
(EtO)2CHCH2CO2Et with aryl aldehyde. This method was developed in a course of evaluation of SO2 
isosteric replacement in analogous of Biginellitype compound MAL1127, active in a Model of 
Huntingtons Disease 12. Another paper obtained the bicyclic structure with a specific methylene
active component  hexane1,3dione. 13 (Figure 1, C). Finally, Bolm and coworkers described 
the Biginellitype reaction with sulfonimidamides leading to 2,3dihydro1,2,6thiadiazine 1oxides 
under solventfree mechanochemical conditions catalyzed by AcOH or Yb(OTf)3 14.
