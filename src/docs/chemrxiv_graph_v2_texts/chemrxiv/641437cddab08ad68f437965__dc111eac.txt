Description:
Improves solubility when combined with certain groups.

Text:
As they are superior in steric demand to the corresponding carbon 
containing analogues, isopropyl and tertbutyl,1,2 they allow the isolation of reactive fblock37 and 
main group complexes812 and improve hydrocarbon solubility.13 Moreover, the introduction of silyl 
groups allows the generation of sensitive (redox)species due to hyperconjugation effects, allowing the 
isolation of highly reduced organic compounds1418 or lowvalent actinide and lanthanide compounds, 
like C5H5n(SiMe3)n3M1 (n  1, 2) containing metal centers with a formal oxidation state of II as 
demonstrated by the Evans group.1924 Although higher degrees of silylation are expected to result in 
an increased kinetic stability of lowvalent species due to steric demand and changed electronic 
properties of the Cp ligand, the demanded steric overload and the further changed electronic properties 
of the Cp ligands pose a formidable synthetic challenge.
