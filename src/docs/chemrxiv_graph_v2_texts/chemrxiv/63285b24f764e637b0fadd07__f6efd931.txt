Moreover, hydrosilylation opens a route to a wide variety of organosilicon products that 
38 
are widely used in nearly all fields of human activity, from aviation and space industries 
39 
to agriculture and medicine.2

This process was first mentioned in the middle of the 20th century, but a real 
41 
breakthrough in this field was made in 1957 in a work by Speier who was the first to 
42 
suggest the use of H2PtCl6 (in iPrOH; Speiers catalyst) as a homogenous catalyst for 
43 
the antiMarkovnikov hydrosilylation of unsaturated compounds.3 The application of 
44 
Speiers catalyst made it possible to expand the capabilities of hydrosilylation 
45 
significantly and make it an industrial process.

An industry that consumed about 5.6 tons of platinum in 2007.

Studies on the synthesis 
55 
of new Ptcomplexes are still continuing. Thus, in recent years, articles on the 
56 
development of new highly active and selective homogeneous Ptcatalysts of 
57 
hydrosilylation, in particular singleatom catalysts (SAC), were published.5 However, 
58 
Speiers and Karstedts catalysts still hold their position as the main industrial 
59 
hydrosilylation catalysts.1 Although these Ptcatalysts are efficient at rather low loads 
60 
(0.1 mol), the industrial consumption of platinum is high. In 2007, the organosilicon 
61 
industry consumed about 5.6 tons of platinum.6
