Mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 accumulation is essential to tackle the current climate change 
and loss of biodiversity.1 Large scale global efforts are ongoing to develop CO2 conversion 
technologies for green fuel production.2 Solardriven CO2 conversion is a promising approach to 
produce clean fuels and chemicals as it directly utilizes sunlight as the sole energy input.35 
However, current CO2 utilization processes depend on pure and pressurized CO2 as reactant, 
whose production from postcombustion emission streams and air is energy intensive (2 GJ 
tonCO21 or 100 kJ molCO21).6,7 Majority of this energy demand (80) is from desorption and 
compression steps following CO2 capture, involving heating large volumes of alkanolamine 
solutions and subsequent pressurization of the released gas (Figure 1a).8,9 Direct solardriven 
utilization of captured CO2 species is therefore a more attractive way to reach netzero carbon 
cycle, but barely explored due to their thermodynamic stability.10,11,12,13 Thermocatalytic 
hydrogenation of captured CO2 has recently been reported at elevated temperatures (100150 
C).1416 Electrochemical reduction of alkanolamine captured CO2 can also be achieved over 
metallic electrodes (Ag, Cu, etc.)
