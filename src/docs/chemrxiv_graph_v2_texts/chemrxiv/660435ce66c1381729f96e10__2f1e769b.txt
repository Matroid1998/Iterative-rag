Description:
Isoelectronic with CO and can be combined to form homocoupled products.

Focusing on C2 products, it has 
been shown that two equivalents of CO can be combined at reducing metal centres to form 
ethynediolates,612 ethenediolates,1318 ethanediolates,19 ketenes,20 an acetaldehyde enolate,21 and 
ethene.22 Isocyanides (CNR, R  alkyl, aryl) are isoelectronic with CO. Related reactions that combine 
two or more equivalents of isocyanide to form homocoupled products are widely reported (Figure 
1).2337 When considering these studies, an obvious question arises as to whether it might be possible 
to combine CO and CNR to form crosscoupled products. For the C2 series this would potentially lead 
to the formation of products containing a 1,2difunctionalised carbon chain with vicinal oxygen and 
nitrogen containing functional groups.
