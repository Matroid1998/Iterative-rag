Due to the rising amount of new chemicals released to the environment nontargeted analysis using 
27 
mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to liquidgas chromatography (LCGC) have risen as a new approach in 
28 
analytical chemistry to detect, identify and eventually quantify chemicals in environmental samples 1,2. 29 
Especially nontargeted analysis is prevalent when working with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine 
30 
(UDMH), which is a toxic component of rocket fuel. The particular complexity of UDMH as a research 
31 
object lies in its high reactivity, which leads to the formation of a large number of transformation products 
32 
3,4. Establishing the structure of new UDMH transformation products is a challenging task as standard 
33 
samples are in most cases unavailable.
