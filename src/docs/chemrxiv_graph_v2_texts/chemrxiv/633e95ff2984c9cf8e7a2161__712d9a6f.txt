Description:
A novel equiatomic (super)hard compound proposed using the glitter C6 structure as a template.

Text:
Tetragonal C6 is characterized by mixed C(sp2)C(sp3) hybridizations and reveals 
exceptional mechanical properties (very high hardness and elastic moduli) while being dynamically 
stable with electronic conductivity due to trigonal C(sp2) atoms. At this point, we should mention that tetC6 shows similarities with glitter C6 proposed 
theoretically as a dense tetragonal hexacarbon starting ad hoc from 1,4cyclohexadienoid units 8. The corresponding structure shown in Fig. 1d consists of four trigonal carbons C(sp2) and two 
tetrahedral carbons C(sp3). The structure was called glitter, i.e. shining due to the electronic 
conductivity. First principles investigations and full characterization of glitter C6 was recently 
undertaken, and the structure was used as template to propose novel equiatomic (super)hard SiCN 
9.
