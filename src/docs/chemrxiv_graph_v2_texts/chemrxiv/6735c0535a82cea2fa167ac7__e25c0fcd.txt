Electrochemical energy conversion technologies such as electrolyzers or fuel cells are crucial for renewable 
energy storage, efuel synthesis, and a nonfossilbased industry1,2. One prominent example is a water 
electrolyzer where hydrogen is produced on the cathode via the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen 
is produced on the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimization of catalytic processes 
taking place at the interface between catalyst and the electrolyte remain a challenge, particularly for the 
OER as it suffers from sluggish kinetics, that limit the efficiency of the overall reaction3,4. Therefore, the 
catalytic properties of the OER catalyst material must be optimized to decrease the OER overpotential3,4. Perovskite oxides are one promising material class to reduce the high overpotentials in the OER.
