Description:
A molecule containing an amino group used in hyperpolarization studies.

Text:
SABREbased hyperpolar
ization can be generated quickly (buildup of hyperpolariza
tion in seconds compared to minuteshours for DNP) and,
importantly, in situ inside NMR spectrometers 23,24. SABRE is based on spinorder transfer from parahydro
gen (pH2)a nuclear spin isomer of hydrogen gas 25to
a substrate of interest that can undergo reversible associ
ation with a polarization transfer catalyst (PTC), see Fig
ure 1a. For this study, we chose four substrates (with natu
ral isotopic abundance of 13C and 15N nuclei) containing
aminogroups
benzylamine, phenylethylamine (phenethy
lamine), 4aminopyridine, and ammonia (Fig. 1b). These
molecules are present in various biological and industri
ally important samples and their hyperpolarization and in
situ detection by benchtop NMR spectroscopy would signif
icantly accelerate the analysis.
