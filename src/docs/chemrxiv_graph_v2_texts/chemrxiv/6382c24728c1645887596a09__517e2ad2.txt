Description:
A bimetallic nano hybrid that is expensive.

Text:
For example, the method of Xiaochen Ji et al uses nobel metal 
palladium and methyl acrylate, which is toxic and stinky24, 25. As far as Mandeep Kaurs method is concerned, bimetallic AuFe3O4 Nano
Hybrid is expensive, and methyl propiolate is toxic, corrosive and highly irritating26. CF3ynones is not a cheap and easily available reagent, 
and its preparation usually requires a complex process27. The method of J. Zeng et al need to use Grignard reagent and Ti(OEt)4, which are 
hazardous and moisture sensitivity28. The method of Masayuki Wasa et al needs high temperature and uses noble metal Pd0 and PCy2tBu
HBF4, the latter is skin corrosive irritant29.
