Description:
A highly conductive metal-organic framework with a conductivity of 0.45 S/cm, classified as a Robin-Day class III mixed valence compound with high electronic delocalization.

Text:
The orbitals
of the ligand are energetically matched with transition metal
3dorbitals, enabling effective metalligand coordination and
longrange conjugated pathways along the framework struts
for efficient charge transport 28. The magnetoelectronic properties of three MOFs using
dhbq as their ligand have been investigated experimentally 29,30. The conductivities of Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 and
V2(Cl2dhbq)3 were found to be 2.7  103 Scm, 1.4  102
Scm and 0.45 Scm, respectively. These are high values
compared to other MOFs, especially V2(Cl2dhbq)3 which is
one of the most conducting frameworks based on oxodonor
linkers reported to date. Optical spectroscopy indicated
a high degree of electronic delocalisation in V2(Cl2dhbq)3,
which led to a classification as a RobinDay class III mixed
valence compound, whereas Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3
were classified as class II.
