Description:
A metal with extremely high theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g1) and low reduction potential (3.05 V vs. SHE) used in solid-state batteries.

Text:
Solidstate batteries (SSBs) are at the forefront of nextgeneration energy storage technologies 
as they offer improved specific energy, energy density, and safety13. In particular, the use of 
lithium metal anodes in SSBs has attracted significant attention due to the opportunity to achieve 
specific energies greater than 350 Wh kg1 4,5. It is believed that the use of a solidstate electrolyte 
(SSE) can mitigate the effects of dendritic deposition and inactive lithium formation that plague 
lithium metal anodes in liquid electrolytes6,7, thereby safely taking advantage of the extremely high 
theoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g1) and low reduction potential (3.05 V vs. SHE) of lithium. A key challenge in the development of lithium metalbased SSBs is to achieve uniform lithium 
deposition at LiSSE interfaces810.

Description:
A metal that penetrates through a variety of solid-state electrolyte materials during deposition, leading to short circuits.

Text:
While SSEs were originally theorized to mechanically resist 
dendrite or filament formation11, it has been shown that lithium metal penetrates through a wide 
variety of SSE materials during deposition, which results in catastrophic short circuits1217. This 
behavior is more prominent at high current densities, where electrodeposition becomes 
increasingly nonuniform and filamentary. Although the exact mechanisms behind lithium 
penetration are not entirely understood and depend on the properties of the SSE, recent work has 
suggested that lithium penetration is primarily driven by fracture of the SSE and subsequent 
deposition of lithium into cracks1821. Furthermore, a variety of studies has shown that unstable 
lithium deposition is affected by surface defects, grain boundaries, microstructural 
inhomogeneities, electronic conductivity, and other factors12,16,1924.

Description:
Plays a major role in destabilizing deposition at LiSSE interfaces and can penetrate through SSE to form a short circuit when local current densities are high.

Text:
Recent studies have also demonstrated that stripping at LiSSE interfaces plays a major role in 
destabilizing subsequent lithium deposition2529. Stripping current densities that exceed the rate 
at which lithium can be replenished at the interface via deformation andor selfdiffusion lead to 
contact loss through the formation of interfacial voids. Contact loss causes higher current 
densities at the interface, and current constriction at the edges of interfacial voids further 
increases local current densities10,25. When plating occurs after contact loss, these higher local 
current densities increase the likelihood that lithium will penetrate through the SSE to form a short 
circuit. Efforts toward reducing the prevalence of lithium penetration and short circuiting in lithium metal 
SSBs have primarily emphasized the importance of platingstripping rates in dictating cell stability.

Description:
A metal whose plating and stripping behaviors are influenced by current densities.

Text:
It has been widely reported that sufficiently high plating current densities drive lithium penetration, 
and that stripping current densities exceeding the lithium replenishment rate destabilize 
subsequent plating. However, this prevailing focus on current density has overshadowed another
