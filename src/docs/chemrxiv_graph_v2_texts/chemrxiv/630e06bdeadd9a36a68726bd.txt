Description:
Complexes that undergo light-induced low-spin to high-spin transitions, important for molecular data storage.

Text:
This is showcased by the lightinduced lowspin
(LS) highspin (HS) transition in Fe(II) polypyridyl complexes, which have attracted
grand attention due to its potential importance in new technologies, e.g., molecular data
storage.3,4 From femtosecond transient optical absorption5 (TOAS), Xray absorption6,7
and Xray emission spectroscopy8,9 (XES) investigations, it is known that irradiation of
the prototypical Fe(bipy)32 complex (bipy  2,2bipyridine) by visible light promotes
the system from the LS ground state (1GS) into singlet metaltoligand charge transfer
states (1MLCT), which in turn leads to conversion into the quintet HS state in 200 fs.
