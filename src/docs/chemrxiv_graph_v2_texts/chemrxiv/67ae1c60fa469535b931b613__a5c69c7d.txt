Description:
Chemically stable compounds with temperature resistance and dielectric properties, widely used in electrical equipment and as plasticizers in polymers and paints.

Text:
Due to their chemical stability, 
temperature resistance and dielectric properties they had been widely used, for example, in 
closed electrical equipment but also openly as plasticizers in polymers and paints.5,6 It was 
estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million tons of PCBs were produced worldwide since the 
1920s until being mostly banned in the 1980s and 90s.7 Because of improper discharge and 
high environmental mobility, they are not only found around urban industrialized places like 
Munich in Germany,8 the San Francisco Bay in the United States9 or megalopolises in China,10 
but also in more rural areas like the Himalayan riverine network in Pakistan11 or down at the 
Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean.12 The omnipresence is particularly concerning as it is 
known that PCBs negatively influence early childhood development13,14 and are declared 
carcinogenic15 among other harmful effects.16 In the river Nile in Egypt concentrations of PCBs 
between 14 and 20 g L1 were measured17, while the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency enforces a maximum contaminant level of 0.5 g L1 with the declared goal of zero 
residues in their national primary drinking water regulations.18 In fact, the Stockholm 
Convention set the sophisticated aim of complete and environmentallyfriendly elimination of 
PCBs until 2028 to obey the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.19 
Therefore, it is necessary to efficiently clean waste water from PCBs at very low 
concentrations, socalled trace concentrations.
