Description:
A phosphorus-rich phosphide with established bulk synthesis as a single crystal or powder.

However, reports of polycrys
talline Prich phosphides as thin films are very scarce
and seem to be limited to basic characterization of ZnP2
and CdP2 deposited by evaporation of powders of the
presynthesized compounds.3,4 Thinfilm growth from el

the synthesis process. Similar to other Prich phosphides, bulk synthesis of
CuP2 as a singlecrystal or powder is well established510
but there are no reports of thinfilm growth.

Description:
A semiconductor proposed as a solar absorber, thermoelectric material, and electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution.

Text:
CuP2 is
a semiconductor that has been proposed as a solar ab
sorber,11 thermoelectric material,12,13 electrocatalyst for
hydrogen and oxygen evolution,14 and as a component
in composite anode materials for Li1517 and Nabased
batteries.18,19 Although CuP2 has been incorporated in
electrochemical devices, its optoelectronic and thermo
electric characterization is incomplete. For example, the
optical absorption coefficient of CuP2 crystals has only
been measured in the weak absorption region just above
its 1.4 eV1.5 eV band gap,8,10 so it is impossible to eval
uate its performance as a light absorber in the visible. For thermoelectric applications, the properties needed
to calculate the quality factor zT have only been mea
sured separately on different CuP2 specimens in single
crystal or powder form.
