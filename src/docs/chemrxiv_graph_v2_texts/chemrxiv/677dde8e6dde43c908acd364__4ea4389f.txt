Description:
Induces fragmentation following ozonolysis to generate derivatives.

Deconstructive transformations in organic synthesis are valuable approaches to utilizing 
chiral pool materials that include functional groups that can be removed in a synthetic route. Performing deconstruction of Csp3Csp2 species can be particularly useful in terpenebased 
frameworks, as these chiral natural products often contain isopropenyl groups that are often not 
included in the final products. Hydrodealkenylation is a deconstructive transformation that enables 
the usage of chiral pool starting materials containing excess alkenyl functionality for the overall 
synthetic route. The ability to remove such groups without interfering with other functional groups 
already in place in the molecule is a challenge that has been explored briefly wherein ozonolysis 
is followed by Fe (II)induced fragmentation to generate a number of derivatives (Fig. 1A,B)1.
