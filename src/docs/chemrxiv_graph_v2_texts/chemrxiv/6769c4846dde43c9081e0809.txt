Involved in hydrogen bonding, a key interaction in biomolecular systems.

for dispersion and hydrogen bonding.1,4,5 Such 
augmented methods, most notably PM6D3H4X, provide a highly accurate description of non
covalent interactions in large biomolecular systems, such as proteinligand and proteinprotein 
complexes for which reliable crystal structures are available.6 Recently, an empirical correction 
for close SO contacts (PM6D3H4S) has been developed,7 which was applied to describe 
chalcogen bonds in biomolecular complexes.8 To extend the utility of PM6D3H4 to aqueous 
solutions, the COSMO2 implicit solvent model was reparametrized for singlepoint energies with 
superior performance for model systems as well as proteinligand complexes.9,10 
The binding of insulin to its receptor (insulin receptor, IR) produces a proteinprotein 
complex of primary clinical relevance.
