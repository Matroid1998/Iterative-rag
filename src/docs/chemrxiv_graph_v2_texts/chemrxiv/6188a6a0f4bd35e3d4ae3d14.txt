Involved in heterogeneous reactions, such as activation on metal oxide surfaces.

In the context of heterogeneous catalysis, computational methods are relatively mature for
12
characterizing the transition states of targeted reactions,612 performing microkinetic modeling on
13
established reaction networks, and using descriptorbased methods for improving catalysts.1316
14
However, a central challenge in characterizing new catalytic interfaces lies in establishing the ki
15
netically relevant reaction network, which is often based on intuition and can be timeconsuming
16
and error prone to characterize ad hoc.4,5 Indeed, even seemingly simple heterogeneous reactions,
17
like methane activation on metal oxide surfaces, can be decomposed into multiple elementary
18
steps.17,18 Furthermore, catalytic cycles can involve many intermediates or even open ended reac
19
tant lists such that brute force enumeration and characterization are infeasible.
