Description:
Dimers whose formation, disassembly, and stability depend on the size of alkali metal cations.

Text:
showed that the 
formation, disassembly, and stability of crown ether fullerene dimers depend on the size of 
the alkali metal cations used, which was attributed to different adduction sites.4 Rister et al. used IMMS to separate isobaric steroids and reported varying CCS resolutions for different 
A, highlighting the relevance of choosing the most suitable chargecarrying species.3 
In this work, we investigate the influence of different cations A (A  H, Na, K, Cs), and 
H2O, on the disassembly, stability, and conformational landscape of metallosupramolecular 
complexes, namely the homometallic ring Cr8F8(O2CtBu)16  RingCr and the rotaxane 
families PhM and AmM, NH2RRCr7MF8(O2CtBu)16, where for PhM the thread NH2RR is 
NH2(CH2Ph)(CH2CH2Ph) 
(TPh) 
and 
for 
AmM 
the 
thread 
NH2RR 
is 
NH2(C6H12NHC(O)tBu)2 (TAm), with M  MnII, FeII, CoII, NiII, CuII, ZnII, CdII.
