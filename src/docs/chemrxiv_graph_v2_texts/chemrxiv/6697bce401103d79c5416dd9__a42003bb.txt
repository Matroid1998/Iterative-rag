Description:
A divalent metal cation that coordinates to six halide anions in perovskites.

3D halide perovskites with formula ABX3 have demonstrated exceptional photoelectric performance.711 In this 
structure, a divalent metal cation (B site; e.g., Sn2 and Pb2) coordinates to six halide anions (X site; e.g., I, Br, 
and Cl) to form a BX6 octahedral framework. Furthermore, a monovalent cation (A site; e.g., MA, FA, and Cs) 
occupies the centers of four BX6 octahedra. Nonetheless, the lack of stability continues to hinder the 
commercialization of MHP filmbased devices. Recent studies have shown that the inclusion of longchain organic 
cation spacers in 3D perovskite can produce 2D perovskite, which enhances the films stability against aging and 
decomposition caused by exposure to water and oxygen.1221 Specifically, 2D perovskite is typically 
represented by the formula (A)m(A)n1BnX3n1.
