Description:
A solvent used in the electrochemical formation and EPR characterization of radicals.

Text:
An early example of the 
sensitivity of 1 EPR spectra is Riegers computational study, who demonstrated that the solvent, in this 
case dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, plays a significant role in the hyperfine coupling constants 
(HFCs) of 1.29 Some years later, Geske and Maki reported the in situ electrochemical formation and EPR 
characterisation of 1 via cathodic reduction in acetonitrile with nPr4NClO4 as buffer in a mercury pool 
electrode.30 They were able to model the EPR spectra considering a monoradical ( 2.0032) 
experiencing HFCs to one nitrogen, and two ortho, two meta and one para hydrogen atoms (  10.32, 
  3.39,   1.09,   3.97 Gauss, respectively  see Equation 1 and Table S1).
