Description:
A greenhouse gas whose atmospheric concentrations are targeted for reduction through capture and storage.

Text:
Carbon capture and storage from fossilbased power generation is a critical component of realistic 
strategies for preventing a further rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, capturing 
meaningful amounts of CO2 using current technology could result in a prohibitive rise in the cost 
of electric power consumed. One strategy to minimize energy consumption and economic 
penalties is to exploit industrial streams in which CO2 is already at high partial pressures, such as 
the syngas exiting coal gasifiers at integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants.

Description:
An acid gas commonly removed from syngas streams using physical solvents.

In these highpressure CO2containing streams, one wellestablished approach to removing acid 
gases (CO2 and H2S) from the syngas stream is the use of physical solvents.1 
The physical solvents used in precombustion capture of CO2 from coalgasified power plants are 
typically more effective at high pressures than chemical solvents.2 Physical solvents that have 
been studied for CO2 absorption include Nmethyl2pyrrolidone (NMP  Purisol), propylene 
carbonate (Fluor solvent),3 methanol (Rectisol),4 and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol 
(Selexol).5,6 
One physical solvent that had been studied earlier, but was then seemingly neglected, is tributyl 
phosphate (TBP), originally identified in the Estasolvan process.7 This solvent was used for 
natural gas purification and while it showed only moderate capacity to absorb CO2, it was an 
excellent solvent for absorbing H2S and SO2.8,9 The inclusion of etheric side chains in the form
