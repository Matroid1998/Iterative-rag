Description:
Compounds formed from the dehalogenation of haloalcohols and can undergo ring opening with nucleophiles.

Text:
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) have recently distinguished themselves as powerful enzymes for the 
asymmetric diversification of oxyfunctionalized synthons.18 In nature, these bacterial lyases catalyze the reversible 
dehalogenation of haloalcohols through formation of the corresponding epoxides.9 More importantly, they are 
capable of accepting a number of anionic C, N, O, and Snucleophiles in the reverse reaction, i.e. epoxide ring 
opening, giving access to a large repertoire of valuable products.10 For instance, recent impressive biocatalytic 
examples for the application of HHDHs in asymmetric synthesis include the preparation of enantiopure 
nitroalcohols11, and thiiranes12, as well as the desymmetrization of 2substituted1,3dichloro2propanols with 
subsequent cyanatemediated ring opening to afford optically pure epoxides and oxazolidinones1 among others.

Description:
Compounds that undergo ring opening reactions catalyzed by enzymes like HheC.

We selected these HHDHs based on their biocatalytic relevance,4,10,13,20,2528 the fact that both enzymes offer high
resolution crystal structures,17,20,26 as well as their highly dissimilar catalytic properties. HheC is the by far best 
studied member of the HHDH family, generally displaying high catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the 
dehalogenation of various substrates as well as in the ring opening of terminal epoxides.35,15,2933 Moreover, 
numerous protein engineering studies of HheC have been published aiming either at an increased activity, 
enantioselectivity or stability of the enzyme.3437 In contrast, HheG is rather thermolabile and much less selective.

Description:
Compounds with a three-membered cyclic ether structure that can undergo ring-opening reactions.

However, this HHDH was the first reported enzyme with relevant ringopening activity towards sterically more 
demanding internal epoxides (cyclic as well as acyclic).19,20,2628,38 Even though less protein engineering data are 
available for HheG so far, the enzyme exhibits distinct structural differences compared to HheC.20,26,27,38,39 This 
includes a much broader and open active site, an additional helix in the nucleophile binding site loop, as well as 
a long and highly flexible loop in the Nterminal part of the protein, modulating substrate access to but possibly also 
substrate binding in the active site.20,40 
In this work, we experimentally examined all possible single mutants of HheC and HheG with defined 
amino acid exchanges at the three conserved motif 1 residues, namely threonine, phenylalaninetyrosine and 
glycine (Figure 1A), to investigate the impact of each residue on enzyme activity, selectivity and stability.
