For instance, the advancements
in Cbased materials have revolutionized fields like hydrogen storage1015 and the capture of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pollutants.1618
Recent advancements in theoretical and computational methodologies, particularly those
based on quantum mechanics (QM), such as density functional theory (DFT)19,20 have sig
nificantly enhanced our ability to study and explore materials at the atomic scale. While
QM methods provide accurate understanding into material behavior, the computational cost
of them increases with the system size,21,22 hindering their applications for exploring exten
sive energy landscapes or largescale simulations. Therefore, we need a tradeoff between
accuracy and computational cost in modeling materials at atomic scale.
