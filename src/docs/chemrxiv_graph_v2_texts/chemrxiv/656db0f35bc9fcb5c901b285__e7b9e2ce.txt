Description:
An effective treatment for the Ebola virus and approved for use against SARS-CoV-2.

Text:
Compounds containing one or more phosphorus atoms in the P(V) oxidation state are important to chemistry, biology, and 
medicine (Scheme 1A).1,2 These include marketed antiviral drugs such as such as Tenofovir alafenamide3 and Remdesivir, the 
latter being an effective treatment for the Ebola virus4 which was also approved for use against SARSCoV2.5,6 Other relevant 
compounds include Fosinopril,7 a compound used to treat hypertension and heart failure and WHO essential medicines listed 
chemotherapy agent Cyclophosphamide.8 In addition to being common APIs, P(V) containing compounds are also highly 
relevant motifs in agrochemistry.9 A representative example is the herbicide Zytron developed by Dow.10 As such, the 
development of efficient methods for the preparation of enantioenriched P(V) containing compounds is crucial.
