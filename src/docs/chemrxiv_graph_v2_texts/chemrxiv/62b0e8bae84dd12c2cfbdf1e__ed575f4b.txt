Early actinides display facile redox chemistry compared to lanthanides.

Recent advances in heavy element chemistry spurred by innovative molecular design, new 
spectroscopic techniques, and relativistic theory have evolved our understanding of the divergence 
between the chemistries of 5f elements and their 4f counterparts. Historically the primary 
distinction between these two series has been that early actinides display facile redox chemistry 
compared to lanthanides with the exception of those with special electronic configurations such as 
EuII (4f 7) and YbII (4f 14).1 This key attribute is largely lost in all transplutonium elements 
(excluding nobelium) where the most stable oxidation state is 3 akin to lanthanides.2 This has led 
to the notion that their chemistries are lanthanidelike.

Description:
Elements from californium to nobelium with accessible 2 oxidation states.

The combination of this bias with their 
scarcity, short halflives, and need for specialized research facilities has further stymied progress 
in understanding these elements. However, it has been known for several decades that actinides 
from californium to nobelium have accessible 2 oxidation states.3 In fact, electro and 
thermochemical measurements have shown a progressive stabilization of the 2 state ultimately 
revealing that NoII is more stable than NoIII by 1.45 V.46 

Of late significant efforts have been dedicated to isolating complexes containing felements 
in either new or rare oxidation states for the purpose of determining their electronic configurations, 
bonding trends, spectroscopic features, and reactivity.
