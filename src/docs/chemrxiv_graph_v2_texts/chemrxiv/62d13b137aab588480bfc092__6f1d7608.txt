Zeolites are crystalline, microporous materials renowned for their molecular sieving and catalytic 
applications. 1,2 The aluminosilicate framework is assembled from silica and alumina tetrahedra 
linked through apical oxygen atoms. Chargecompensating cations reside in the zeolite pores to 
render an overall neutral framework. Existing zeolite materials are often modified to optimise their 
performance in many applications. For example, cation exchange can be used to tailor the pore 
architecture of a zeolite to significantly improve its selectivity, adsorption and diffusion properties. We have previously shown that changing the nature of the extraframework cations in zeolites A 
(LTA) and Y (FAU) can cause structural modifications, such as altering the size of the unitcell and 
pore windows and changing the local environment of aluminium atoms in the framework.
