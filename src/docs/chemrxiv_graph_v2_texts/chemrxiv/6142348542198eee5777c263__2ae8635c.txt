Description:
Used in catalysts that work better than iron-based ones under milder conditions.

For industrial ammonia synthesis, it is 
widely recognized that Rubased catalysts work better than Febased 
catalysts under milder reaction conditions 11,12. However, the high 
activation energy for direct N2 dissociation and the severe poisoning 
effect of hydrogen on conventional Ru metal catalyst renders 
efficient NH3 synthesis under lower temperatures ( 623 K) and lower 
pressures ( 50 bar) unattainable13. Therefore, many attempts to 
develop new catalysts for efficiently catalyzing N2H2 to NH3 under 
mild conditions1417. Recently discovered, a new class of ammonia 
catalysts  the ternary ruthenium complex hydrides18 is a 
breakthrough in this endeavor.

Description:
A component of ternary complex hydrides used to produce NH3 at low temperature by selective N2 activation.

Text:
In this paper, we present the reaction mechanism facilitating ternary 
ruthenium complex hydrides to successfully produce NH3 at low 
temperature (448 K  T  573 K) by selective N2 activation and 
escaping H2 oversaturation. This work shows the unique ability of 
the RuH64 catalytic center in the ternary ruthenium hydride to shift 
its ratedetermining intermediate states and transition states of the 
N2H2 to NH3 reaction path in response to the lowering of the 
reaction temperature, which brings a significant change in reaction 
order of hydrogen and ammonia. This variation in the kinetics as a 
function of operating conditions (temperature, reactant partial 
pressures, etc.) is not a common phenomenon in catalysis but is 
observed in some cases 1923.
