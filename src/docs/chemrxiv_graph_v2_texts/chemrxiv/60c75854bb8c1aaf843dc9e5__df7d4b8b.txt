Among lowdimensional carbon allotropes (such as graphene and carbon nanotubes), the 
33 
buckminsterfullerene molecule (C60) is a class of 0dimensional (0D) organic compounds of 
34 
spherical molecular shape and high surface area, displaying remarkable physical and chemical 
35 
properties due to surfaceinterfacial effects and quantum confinement1. In particular, C60 displays 
36 
a remarkable electron acceptor character with a semiconductor bandgap. Also, C60 is merely 
37 
composed of sp2hybridized carbon atoms, which confer it an electrondeficient polyalkene nature, 
38 
and thus, it is chemically reactive1.
