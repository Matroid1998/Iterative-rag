Description:
A product of higher hydrocarbon conversion that can be used in synthesis processes.

Text:
Materials engineering and catalysis are known as central sciences, which can deeply contribute to the
technological development of our nations, and as well as ensure the environmental protection and cleaning from
both organic and inorganic contaminants. So, the design and synthesis of powerfully performance materials are
required for many technologies, such as in conversion of higher hydrocarbons to lower hydrocarbon as methane
(CH4) or to carbon monoxide (COCO2), methanol (CH3OH) or even to hydrogen (H2) 1,2. Also, performance
hybrid materials are also so wanted for recycling waste products such harmless (CO2), and harmful (CONOx) to
valueadded products, because it should be considered as an alternative fuels, which limit the use of feedstock
fuels from natural gas reforming or higher hydrocarbons cracking 3,4.
