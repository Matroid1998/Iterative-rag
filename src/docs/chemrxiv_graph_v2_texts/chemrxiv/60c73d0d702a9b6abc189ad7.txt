Description:
Materials with unique structures displaying mechanical properties such as large-scale elastic anisotropy and complete auxeticity.

Text:
Indeed, among the large array of topologies observed in
known zeolites, there are unique structures that display mechanical properties unusual in
the inorganic world, such as largescale elastic anisotropy. This also includes a structure that
displays complete auxeticity,3 a rare property demonstrated by few materials, and even fewer
crystalline structures.4 Moreover, it has been proposed that mechanical stability, reected
in the elastic properties of the frameworks, plays a key role in the selection of feasible zeo
lite structures, i.e.
