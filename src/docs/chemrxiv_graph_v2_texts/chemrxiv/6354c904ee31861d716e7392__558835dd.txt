Description:
Typically used as catalysts for the reduction of vanillin.

alcohols and 
diols).7.These alcohols are more conducive to the subsequent processing of biooils 
with increased hydrogen content 8.Vanillyl alcohol is also more costly and expensive to 
produce than vanillin and can be used directly as a flavouring 9.MMMP can be used as 
a fuel additive or food flavouring agent10,and is also widely used as an intermediate for 
flavours or drugs and fragrances11.The difficulty in this reaction is the selectivity 
control of the hydrogenation products. The catalysts typically used for the reduction of 
vanillin are divided into two main categories, noble metals and transition metals. The 
usual noble metal catalystsAu12, Ru13, Pd14due to their excellent catalytic reduction 
ability, will strip off O in one step during the reaction to produce 4methyl guaiacol 
(MMP).
