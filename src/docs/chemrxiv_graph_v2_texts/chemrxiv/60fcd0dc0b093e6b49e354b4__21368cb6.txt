Description:
Molecules composed of a lactonic ring and a carbonate chain connected by an amide, used as autoinducers in Lux type quorum sensing systems.

Nowadays, there are known twenty transcription factors (TFs) involved in QS; all of them having multiple 
interactions with each other 6. Las, Rhl, PQS, and IQS are related to the activation of QS and the 
production of multiple virulence factors (elastase, protease, rhamnolipids, pyocyanin, hydrogen cyanide) 7, 
8; Las and Rhl are systems of the Lux type, while PQS is a quinolone dependent system. Las and Rhl systems are important for QS activation. These systems have an inductor protein (LasI and 
RhlI) and a receptor protein (LasR and RhlR); inductors synthesize AIs and receptors recognize them 9. Lux type systems work with acylhomoserine lactone molecules like AIs. These molecules are composed of 
a lactonic ring and a carbonate chain of variable size connected by an amide.
