Description:
Can be produced directly from lignocellulosic biomass fractions.

Text:
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is considered to be a promising technology for 
upgrading biomass into fuels and valuable chemicals in the presence of multiphase 
catalysts 1. Lignin accounts for 10  35  by weight and up to 40  of the energy in 
biomass feedstocks 2,As one of the lignocellulosic biomass fractions can be used 
directly in the production of alkanes 3, 4. Vanillin is currently the most abundant 
aromatic molecule produced on an industrial scale from lignin, and is one of the few 
renewable resources that can be easily catalyzed to obtain alkanes5.
