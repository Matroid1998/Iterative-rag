Decarbonizing the global infrastructure for production of chemicals and energy by reducing or 
eliminating the use of fossil fuels is essential to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic climate change.1 
One route to reducing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is through the use of carbonnegative sources 
of energy such as the incomplete combustion of biomass to produce hydrogen (H2). This process 
encompasses numerous mature and industrially implemented biomasstohydrogen technologies, 
including fermentation, super critical water gasification, and steam reformation of pyrolysisgasified 
hydrocarbons.2 The production of H2 from biomass is particularly useful since H2 can be used as both 
industrial feedstock and fuel.
