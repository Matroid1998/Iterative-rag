Description:
Proposed to have the same scaffold as xylogranatin F, except being diastereomeric at the C3, C5, and C10 positions.

Text:
For the limited number of bislactone limonoid 
alkaloids that have been isolated, diversity mainly arises from 
the oxygencontaining substituents present on the C3 position 
(12 to 14), as depicted in Scheme 1.3,4 While the C3methoxy 
group was assigned as the epimer for granatumine A (12), 
several other alkaloids in this class were proposed to have an 
C3substituent, such as the case of xylogranatin F (13). Sur
prisingly, granatoine (14) was proposed to have the same 
scaffold as xylogranatin F (13), except being diastereomeric 
at the C3, C5, and C10 positions.4a 
Traditional methods for pyridine synthesis, including 
Hantzsch5 and Chichibabin6 pyridine synthesis, involve amine 
condensation onto carbonyl compounds, which entails intrin
sic restrictions on the substitution patterns of the target pyri
dines.
