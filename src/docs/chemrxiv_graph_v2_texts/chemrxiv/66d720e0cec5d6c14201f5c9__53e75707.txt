Description:
Reagents used in Ni-catalyzed alkylarylation reactions with amines and aryl halides.

Text:
Herein, we disclose a combination of nitriles and electrondeficient alkenes (EDAs) that enable Nicatalyzed alkylarylation 
of unactivated alkenes in amines with alkylzinc reagents and aryl halides by promoting C(sp3)C(sp3) reductive elimination from a dial
kylnickel(II) species. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024d4wvk ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000289939131 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
