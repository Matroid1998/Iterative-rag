Description:
A solvent used to increase the stability of a two-component BTA-based SCP.

their ability to maintain their 
integrity upon dilution and heating, is hard to achieve upon simple 
design of the monomer structure, probably because of the 
difficulty to properly engineer the aforementioned free energy of 
heterointeraction. Meijer and coworkers reported the higher 
stability in water for an amphiphilic benzene1,3,5tricarboxamide 
(BTA) monomer when coassembled with a BTA monomer 
decorated 
with 
dendronized 
ethylene 
glycolbased35 
or 
monosaccharide side chains.5 Our group recently found that 
adding an achiral monomer significantly increases the stability of 
a twocomponent BTAbased SCP in toluene.36,37 In these 
examples, the enhanced stability was attributed to a subtle 
influence of the comonomer leading locally to a decrease in the 
number of chiral or structural defects.
