Description:
Small organic molecules used in applications such as thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, and photocatalysis.

Text:
Perylene diimide (PDI) small organic molecules have become an increasingly relevant 
class of material in a broad range of applications beyond simple pigments, such as in biological 
systems, thermoelectrics, optoelectronics, sensing, photocatalysis, and synthetic photochemistry.1
7 The successful utilization of PDIs in many of these applications requires an effective doping 
method to produce free carriers in the solidstate or radical anions in solution.
