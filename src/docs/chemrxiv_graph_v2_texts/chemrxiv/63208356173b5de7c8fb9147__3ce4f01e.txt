Description:
A solvent used in a 0.5 M solution of MeMgCl where Mg dendrites have been detected.

Text:
The most
extreme form of nonuniform Mg growth is the formation of dendrites, which occurs much less
frequently at the Mg anode than in the Li equivalent. So far, dendrites have been detected
only for a 0.5 M solution of MeMgCl in THF at a current density of 0.921 mA cm2.14
Third, corrosion of the Mg surface upon contact with ambient air leads to the formation
