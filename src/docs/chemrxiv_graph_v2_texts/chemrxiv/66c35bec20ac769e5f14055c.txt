Description:
A molecule that can exhibit changes in emission properties based on its aggregation state.

Text:
Changes in luminescence color or intensity are strong 
indicators of changes in aggregation behavior in response to external stimuli triggered 
by various noncovalent interactions.21, 22 Aggregationinduced emission (AIE) has 
provided a general platform and research paradigm to study the influence of factors 
such as packing structure, admixture, intermolecular interactions, and aggregate 
morphology on the performance of macroscopic materials from the molecular to the 
aggregate level.2325 In a notable case, Tang and coworkers developed a pyrene
based molecule, PIP, which displayed dim emission in the crystalline state but bright 
emission in the amorphous state due to strong  interactions in the crystalline
