Description:
An abundant, cheap, yet important feedstock for the industrial production of many valuable chemical intermediates, petrochemicals, and fuels.

Text:
Methane (CH4) is the simplest member of aliphatic saturated hydrocarbons called alkanes. It 
constitutes about 8596 wt of natural gas compositions obtained from the cracking of petroleum 
or as a byproduct of coalification or biomass fermentation process 1,2. According to the 
International Energy Agency (IEA, 20A23), approximately 140 billion cubic meters of natural gas 
are flared during the upstream petroleum refining and hydrocarbon production processes annually, 
leading to emissions of nearly 400 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere 3. Fig. 1. Global methane emissions from the energy, 20002022, and Direct CO2 combustion emissions 
from flaring and flaring intensity in the Net Zero Scenario, 20102030 3 
CH4 is one of the abundant, cheap, yet important feedstocks for the industrial production of many 
valuable chemical intermediates, petrochemicals, and fuels.

Description:
A valuable fuel source with high calorific potential used for residential heating, cooking, and electricity generation in gas turbines.

Text:
The abundance, inexpensiveness, and 
high calorific potential of CH4 make it a valuable fuel source for residential heating and cooking, 
as well as for generating electricity in gas turbines 4. Despite all the advantages offered by CH4,
