Copper (Cu) is a redox active metal, which makes it suitable for various essential cellular 
67 
processes such electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration,1,2 the breakdown of reactive 
68 
oxygen species,3,4 and uptake of iron.5 However, the same redox properties that make Cu 
69 
beneficial can be toxic when concentrations exceed what can be properly handled by the cell, 
70 
resulting in decreased cell growth and ultimately leading to cell death.69 The most bioavailable 
71 
and toxic form of Cu is the cupric ion (Cu2).5,6,10 The toxicity threshold for especially sensitive 
72 
microbes, such as cyanobacteria,6,11 can be as low as 1013 M, which is within the range of 
73 
environmental Cu2 concentrations in seawater (1015 to 1012 M).12,13 One strategy microbes 
74 
employ to mitigate the toxicity of Cu2 is to produce organic ligands that complex Cu to make it 
75 
less (or not at all) bioavailable.14,15 For example, phytochelatins (oligomers of glutathione) and 
76 
metallothioneins (a family of low molecular weight proteins) form strong complexes with Cu2 
77 
and have been shown to be produced in response to Cu toxicity.1618 
78 
In seawater, dissolved Cu is almost entirely complexed by organic ligands (CuL).19 
79 
Remobilization of the ligandbound Cu is governed by the structure of the ligand which plays a 
80 
role in determining the strength of complexation, influencing its photoreactivity and ultimately 
81 
the bioavailability of Cu.20 The detection and identification of CuLs in seawater has been 
82 
plagued by analytical challenges common to marine samples  high concentrations of salts, low 
83 
concentrations of individual CuLs, and an ultracomplex background organic matrix.
