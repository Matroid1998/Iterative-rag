Description:
Simple compounds described in millipede studies.

Text:
Very few studies focused on millipedes belonging to the 
other three orders within Colobognatha, and in those limited studies, 
only simple monoterpenes were described.8 However, this changed 
recently and there has been a surge of new chemistry discovered, 
particularly from species of Platydesmida. First, indolizidine and 
quinolizidines were discovered from Brachycybe producta and 
Brachycybe petasata defensive secretions; then deoxybuzonamine 
isomers were described from Brachycybe lecontii and Brachycybe rosea 
secretions; and finally, the highly oxidized ischnocybines were 
discovered from Ischnocybe plicata secretions (Fig. 1).911 The 
ischnocybines incorporate functionality rarely seen within millipede 
metabolites and represent a surprising increase in structural complexity.
