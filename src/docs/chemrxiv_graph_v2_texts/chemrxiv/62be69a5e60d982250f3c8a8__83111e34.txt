Description:
Used as a linker to connect two 10paraphenylene loops in the synthesis of a special oligoparaphenylene nanohoop.

So far, C60CPPs and C70CPPs have 
attracted enough attention with their fascinating topologies.58 
Over the past few years, organic macrocycles with twisted conjugation have 
become the focus of materials chemists on account of their exceptional structures and 
interesting functionalities.913 They typically have unique nanoscale cavities that can 
be used for supramolecular assembly. Very recently, a special oligoparaphenylene 
nanohoop (referred to as OPP in the following) was successfully synthesized by 
employing cyclooctatetrathiophene as a linker to connect two 10paraphenylene 
loops.14 Different from most conjugated monocycles, the newly prepared OPP is a 
dualloop nanohoop with a figureeight configuration.
