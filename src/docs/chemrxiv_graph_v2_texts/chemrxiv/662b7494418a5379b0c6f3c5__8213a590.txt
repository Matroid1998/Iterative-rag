Description:
A compound with 6,561 potential conformers due to eight rotatable bonds.

Text:
The first example involves a DielsAlder reaction between 4,4dimethyl
3methylenepent1ene (1) and (E)dec5ene (2), which has a total of 6,561 potential con
formers due to eight rotatable bonds. The second example involves an intramolecular acid
catalysed cyclization reaction of polycyclic azocane derivative, a previously analyzed reaction
in our group9 and whose selectivity appeared to be driven by conformation equilibria. The
