Description:
Functionalized poly(arylene alkylene) to mitigate backbone degradation.

Therefore, alternative 
PBI chemistries1214 and other polymers based on poly(arylene ether sulfone),15 
perfluorosulfonate,16 imidazole functionalized poly(arylene alkylene),17 poly(vinyl 
alcohol),18 styreneethylenebutylene copolymers19 and poly(oxindole biphenylene)20 have 
been explored with the aim of mitigating backbone degradation. In the field of anion exchange membranes, structures devoid of arylene ether linkages 
and other polarized bonds as part of the backbone architecture are commonly employed to 
prevent degradation.21 This strategy has positioned structures derived from polyethylene,22
