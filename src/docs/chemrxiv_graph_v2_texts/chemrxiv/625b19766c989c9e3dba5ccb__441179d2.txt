Description:
Materials with piezoresponse comparable to 1HMoS2.

Text:
In agreement with the theory4, inplane
piezoelectricity in 1HMoS2 monolayer, which is compa
rable to piezoresponse of commercially used wurtzite
nitrides e.g., d33 of wAlN, has been con rmed by re
cent experiments5. However, generally speaking, a
high piezoresponse in these 2D materials is desired for
any devicelevel applications. Therefore, enhancement
of piezoelectricity as well as discovery of new 2D piezo
electrics has drawn a signi cant research interest. Typ
ically, 1Htype 2D materials (D3h symmetry) have been
investigated for large piezoelectric response 69. So
far, piezoelectricity has been predicted in several families
of nonferroelectric 2D materials like doped or chem
ically modi ed graphene 1012, metal dichalcogenides
or oxides, Janus monolayers 69, 13.
