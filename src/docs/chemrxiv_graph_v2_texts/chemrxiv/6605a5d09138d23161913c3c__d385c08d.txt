Description:
A radical initiator used in polymerization processes.

Text:
The experimental determination of rate
constants is constrained by the operating capabilities of
laboratoryscale reactors and diagnostics, thus inhibiting
the exploration of wider ranges of temperatures (T
 400 K) and limiting the combinations of solvents
and mixture composition typical of (de)polymerization
processes. The
main
reaction
classes
involved
in polymerization processes are well known to be
propagations and terminations of end chain radicals
(ECR) by recombination or disproportionate. ECRs are
formed starting from the reaction of a radical initiator
(usually a peroxide) with a monomer. In addition, at
increasing temperatures, a large proportion of polymer
chains (polyethylene, polystyrene, polybutyl acrylate,
etc.) exhibit a high propensity to form midchain
radicals (MCRs) through intramolecular (or less likely
intermolecular) hydrogen abstraction, also known as
backbiting.
