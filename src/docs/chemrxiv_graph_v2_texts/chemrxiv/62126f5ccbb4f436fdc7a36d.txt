and removal. Here we report the first use of a transient directing group in 
combination with copper to effect CH functionalization. The copper 
mediated bC(sp2)H sulfonylation of aldehydes with sulfinate salts is 
accomplished using alanine, in catalytic quantities, to form a 
transient imine. A broad range of sulfonylated benzaldehydes are 
prepared using copper fluoride as both copper source and oxidant, 
involving a 5,6 cupracyclic intermediate. The transient directing 
group provides exclusive regioselectivity in CH functionalization, 
even in the presence of other strongly coordinating Lewis basic 
groups. In addition, g(peri)sulfonylation of napthyl and phenanthrene 
carboxaldehydes is achieved through 6,6 cupracyclic intermediates. Further derivatisation of the aldehyde products is demonstrated.
