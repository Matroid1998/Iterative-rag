Description:
A tetragonal compound with double Eu layers and a metallic state.

Text:
Orthorhombic Eu3Sn2P4 (Cmca) also has
a metamagnetic transition,5 in analogy with the In
containing compounds, and likewise the precise nature
of the magnetic orderings is unclear. The same com
plexity arises in the double Eu layers of tetragonal Eu
SnP (P4nmm).68 In the compounds where the elec
tron count is not balanced, notably EuSnP and EuSn2P2,
a metallic state should be expected, which indeed oc
curs. In EuSn2P2 the crossing bands are believed to be
split near the Fermi energy by spinorbit coupling to in
duce topologicallyprotected surface states.4,9
Layered compounds, especially those that may be ex
foliable, are under heavy investigation, and Eu serves
