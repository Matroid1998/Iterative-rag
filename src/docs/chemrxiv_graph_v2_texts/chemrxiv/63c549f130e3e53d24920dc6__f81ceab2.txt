Description:
Crystals that can be converted through a chemical reaction into a supramolecular assembly of pyroglutamine molecules.

Text:
We have
64
recently shown, for example, that glutamine aminoacid (Lglu) crystals can be con
65
verted through a chemical reaction, in a supramolecular assembly of pyroglutamine
66
molecules.20 These pyroglutamine molecules are linked together by very strong
67
hydrogen bonds (SHB)21 which appear to endow them with a longer excited state
68
lifetime, ultimately leading to fluorescence. 69
