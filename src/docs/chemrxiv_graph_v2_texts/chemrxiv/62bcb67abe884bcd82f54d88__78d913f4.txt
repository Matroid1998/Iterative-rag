Description:
An amorphous structure that incorporates single metal atoms through coordination with N donor atoms.

The low definition and the presence of side 
phases hinders systematic investigations.9 This impedes the 
development 
of 
structurepropertyrelationships 
and 
consequently a knowledgebased optimization of the preparation 
process towards optimal catalyst activity. Intensive structural 
characterization has shown the active center in MNC catalysts to 
be constituted of single metal atoms incorporated into an 
amorphous carbon structure by coordination of N donor atoms, 
which are covalently doped into the carbon layers, see Figure 1a 
for a schematic depiction. The configuration of the N atoms 
surrounding the metal center and the geometry of the ligand 
sphere are still under debate,6c,9b,10 but most suggestions for the 
active site structure have a square planar nitrogen coordination 
environment in common.11
