Description:
An essential constituent of nucleic acids and lipids, involved in crucial regulatory modifications of proteins.

Text:
If one has to name the most important element of life as we know it, one would probably
not spontaneously think of phosphorus. Accounting for less than 1 of a human body mass,
i.e., much less than carbon or oxygen for example, the vast majority of it composes the
hydroxyapathite, the main constituent of bones. Each kilogram of tissue actually contains
less than a gram of phosphorus. Yet, it is an essential constituant of nucleic acids and lipids,
and it is involved in crucial regulatory modications of proteins. The equilibrium between
diphosphate and triphosphate is at the very core of the freeenergy storage and release in
most biological processes.

Description:
Typically present as phosphate, involved in the rupture and formation of PO chemical bonds.

Text:
Phosphorus is typically present as phosphate, whose incorporation into organic materials
involves the rupture and the formation of PO chemical bonds. The corresponding chemical
reaction is essential for the synthesis or the degradation of nucleic acids, the conversion
between ATP and ADP, the phosphorylation of proteins, the synthesis of phospholipids,
to name a few key examples.
