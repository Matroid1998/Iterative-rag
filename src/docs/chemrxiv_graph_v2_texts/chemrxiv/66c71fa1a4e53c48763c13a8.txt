Description:
Captured CO2 is transported at high pressure above the critical pressure for effective pipeline transport.

Text:
When captured CO2 from e.g. post combustion cap
ture 1 is to be transported from the capture site to a
final destination be it for injection into subsurface reser
voirs for long term storage, for offsite utilisation into var
ious efuels such as emethanol, emethane or Sustainable
Aviation Fuels (SAF), for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
or other means of storage or reuse, high pressure pipeline
transport above the critical pressure is found to be the
most effective method 2, 3. To achieve such high pres
sure, the captured CO2 needs to be pressurised often by
a factor of 100 or more. When CO2 is captured, it exits
the capture facility in a gaseous state, typically at 12 bar
pressure for postcombustion capture.

Description:
A compound involved in postcombustion capture and compression processes from power plants.

Finding the optimal pressurisa
tion pathway has been addressed in several investigations
4, 5, 6, 7. Witkowski and Majkut 4 investigated 13 different
CO2 compression concepts for postcombustion capture
from a 900 MW pulverised coalfired power plant includ
ing heat integration. All cases considered compression
from 1.51 bar to 153 bar. Some of their findings include
a reduction in power by increasing the number of com
pression stages, increasing power with higher interstage
temperatures, and also that a compression path from the
initial pressure to an intermediate pressure followed by
liquefaction and pumping to the final pressure offers sig
nificant reduction in compression power. However, the au
thors do not include a quantification of the compression
power required for the refrigeration cycle. Martynov et al.
