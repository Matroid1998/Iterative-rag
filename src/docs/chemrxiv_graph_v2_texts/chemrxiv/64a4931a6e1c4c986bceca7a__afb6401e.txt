Description:
An ion involved in ion-binding molecular complexes with size-dependent binding preferences.

Text:
of a large ion into a smaller cage creates repulsive forces, resulting in strain that 
depends on the flexibility of the complex. In summary, a datadriven approach provided physical insights into the mechanisms of ion 
selectivity in ionbinding molecular complexes. By studying the energetic preferences of a curated 
dataset of 563 molecular complexes binding to K, Na, and Li using DFT, we found that binding 
preferences are related to ion size. Complexes prefer to exchange to an adjacent ion in the size 
sequence K  Na  Li rather than to the species that is more dissimilar in size.

Description:
Disfavored in binding compared to Li in compounds with large ring sizes.

Text:
While this 
observation follows intuition, we identified unique complexes which deviate from this trend and 
hold significant promise for distinctive forms of selectivity in materials, namely those with planar 
coordinating atoms that could preferentially bind K and Li over Na, compounds with large ring 
sizes despite small coordination numbers that would disfavor Li binding in comparison to Na or 
K, and complexes with N coordinating atoms which favor Li over Na or K. Additionally, we 
showed that the majority of the differential binding energy originates from chemical interaction 
rather than molecular reorganization. Our trained ML models revealed that both electronic and 
geometric features play critical roles in predicting the differential binding energy, and neither 
category strongly dominates the prediction.
