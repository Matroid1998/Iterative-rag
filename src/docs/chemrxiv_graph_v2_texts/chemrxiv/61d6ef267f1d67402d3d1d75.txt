. Lanthanide luminescence is used in highly sensitive timeresolved and 
dissociation enhanced DELFIA bioassays,13 in display and lighting technology,4 and in lasers and 
telecommunication56. All application relies on the robust, atomlike, narrow and highly defined 
absorption and emission lines of the trivalent lanthanide ions. The optical transitions between the 
states in a trivalent lanthanide ion are all forbidden due to symmetry, spin, overlap, and momentum 
conservation. Molecular photophysics rationalize allowed optical transitions in molecules, and has 
strong experimental descriptors.78 As molecular photophysics dictates that an observable can be 
related to specific molecular structure, the union of lanthanide luminescence and molecular
