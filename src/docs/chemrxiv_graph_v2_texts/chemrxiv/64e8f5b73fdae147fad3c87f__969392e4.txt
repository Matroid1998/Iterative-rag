Description:
Undergoes oxidation from Fe3 to Fe4 during OER.

Text:
Operando Mssbauer spectra show the oxidation 
73 
of Fe3 in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide to Fe4 during OER and that these Fe4 species largely 
74 
persist after the potential was decreased into a nonOER region30. Such Fe4 species were 
75 
hypothesized to arise from fully coordinated internal sites within the NiOOH that were too
