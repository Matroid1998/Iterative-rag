Description:
Involved in homopolymerization reactions.

Text:
Since the 
use of solvents is usually undesirable, there is a strong interest to develop an easy 
and modular synthetic route to prepare DMAP analogues with tunable solubility. Another motivation is to provide a convenient method for incorporating additional 
functional groups, such as those used for polymerization or immobilization of 
DMAP derivatives 19,20, or for tuning the activity of the catalysts. Herein we disclose a synthetic methodology based on the azaMichael 
reaction 21 of 4aminopyridine or 1,2,3,4tetrahydropyrido3,4bpyrazine with 
electronpoor olefins, namely acrylonitrile and ethyl acrylate, and test the 
performance of the obtained derivatives and their followup products (Scheme 1) 
in epoxy homopolymerization as well as in the epoxyalcohol reaction.
