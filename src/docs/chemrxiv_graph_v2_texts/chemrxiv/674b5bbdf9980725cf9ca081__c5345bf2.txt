Description:
A high-energy product generated during photosynthesis.

Text:
The most relevant process of lightenergy conversion in nature is photosynthesis, which takes place 
within the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane is a 
lipid bilayer that assembles multiple protein supercomplexes in a transmembrane fashion to absorb 
light and transfer electrons across the membrane to generate highenergy products such as NADPH 
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen) and carbohydrates as well as oxygen as a 
side product.1 The benefit of transmembrane electron transfer is that the oxidation site is physically 
separated from the reduction site and that such compartmentalization can finetune local reaction 
conditions to prevent detrimental recombination.2,3 Additionally, the transmembrane charge 
transfer generates a proton gradient which fuels the ATP synthase (ATP  adenosine triphosphate, 
see Figure 1a).4,5

Description:
Produced in natural photosynthesis as part of the conversion of solar energy.

Text:
a) In natural photosynthesis, the light is 
absorbed by multiple protein supercomplexes to convert solar energy and produce NADPH and ATP 
(PSI  photosystem I, PSII  photosystem II). b) This work integrates a lightactive molecule for 
photoinduced transmembrane electron transfer in a liposome membrane to connect two spatially 
separated oxidation and reduction reactions. Created in httpsBioRender.com. Current artificial photosynthetic systems mostly investigate either an individual catalytic lightdriven 
reduction (e.g., H2 evolution,6 CO2 reduction7) or an individual oxidation reaction (e.g., water 
oxidation),8,9 both of which are still relying on the use of sacrificial reagents. A useful oxidation and
