Description:
Related to an orphan receptor inhibitor in the context of sultams.

Text:
The vast majority of 
synthesized and patented sultams are decorated with a fused 
saturated sulfonamide fragment. Notable examples of of 
m.n.0sultams include an antischizophrenic agent 13, an 
antithrombotic agent 14, an anticancer agent 15, a protease
activated receptor 1 (PAR142) antagonist 16, a secretase 
inhibitor 17,43 and a casein kinase II inhibitor 18.44 
Conversely, bicyclic bridged and spirocyclic sultams are less 
studied, likely due to the limited number of synthesized 
representatives to date, and the scarcity of described 
preparation methods compared to their fused counterparts. This 
chemotype 
is 
represented 
by 
a 
human 
immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor 1945 and a related 
orphan retinoic acid receptorrelated orphan receptor 46 
(ROR) inhibitor 20. Additional interest in saturated sultams has rised from 
their advantageous physicochemical properties.
