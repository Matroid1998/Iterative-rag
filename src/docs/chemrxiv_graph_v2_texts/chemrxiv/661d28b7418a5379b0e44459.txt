Description:
Organic compounds that are byproducts of incomplete combustion and include mutagenic and possible human carcinogens.

Text:
Pyrene belongs to a group of organic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), which are byproducts of incomplete combustion of organic materials and are ubiqui
tous in the environment. They have been variously found in food and water. Several PAHs 
have been identified as mutagenic and some as possible human carcinogens; they are among 
priority compounds listed for monitoring. Pyrene is among 16 PAHs listed by the US EPA as 
a priority compound for monitoring 1, 2. Fig. 1 Structure of pyrene
