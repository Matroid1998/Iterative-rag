A greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.

Realtime sensing of greenhouse gases is essential in environmental studies, air quality and 
2 
process monitoring. Fugitive methane and carbon dioxide emissions, e.g., from distribution 
3 
pipelines, abandoned oil and gas wells and carbon capture sites, have become increasingly 
4 
concerning due to their effect on global warming. Therefore, realtime monitoring, quantifying 
5 
and locating emission sources is essential.13 Commercially available solidstate sensors offer 
6 
a costeffective solution but are hampered by poor selectivity, irreversible poisoning at 
7 
saturation levels and short lifespan under nonideal conditions.
