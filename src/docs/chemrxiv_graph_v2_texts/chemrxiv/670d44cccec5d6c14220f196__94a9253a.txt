Description:
Explored as an excipient for drug formulation, especially in amphiphilic ABA triblock copolymers.

To 
overcome this, amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) can be prepared, wherein the amorphous 
form of a drug is stabilized using suitable excipients, e. g., through tuning the interactions 
between polymeric excipients and drugs.69 This is not only stabilizing the amorphous form, 
but also influencing the dissolution profile and therefore the bioavailability of the drug.10 
Common polymer excipients for the preparation of ASDs are poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)11, 
poly(vinyl pyrrolidonecovinyl acetate)12 or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose1314. Previously, 
poly(2oxazoline) (POx) and poly(2oxazine) (POzi) bearing polymers were explored as 
excipients.1517 Especially, amphiphilic ABA triblock copolymers comprising POxPOzi have 
been used for the formulation of drugs with low water solubility with drug loading up to 
50wt.1824 More recently, these polymers were studied regarding the stabilization of drug 
nanocrystals25 and in drug loaded microneedles26.
