A conjugated polymer frequently utilized as an active material for electrodes in organic batteries.

Conjugated polymers (CPs) have driven innovations in a variety of energy conversion and 
storage fields including organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1,2 supercapacitors,3 transistors,2 
thermoelectrics,2 lithium ion batteries (LIBs),35 and other metal cation battery systems.3,4 
Recently, CP research has increasingly focused on developing novel, simplified reaction schemes 
as an alternative to costly multistep synthetic procedures with traditionally catalyzed cross
coupling reactions that may be difficult to implement at scale.6 For example, previous reports have 
demonstrated that OPV cost scales directly with the number of synthetic steps,7 and significant 
effort has been dedicated towards developing new, comparatively simple polymerization methods 
such as direct heteroarylation to produce conjugated polymers.6,8 

Within the LIB field, polyaniline is frequently utilized as a CP active material for electrodes 
to produce organic batteries.3,4 Similarly, iminebased covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have 
received significant interest as a new class of materials for energy storage applications, including 
as promising LIB electrode materials.9 These materials are typically synthesized using a 
combination of condensation reactions,913 acidcatalyzed conditions,9,1113 autoclavebased 
methods,14,15 or microwaveassisted synthetic procedures,12 which are often not compatible with 
other fragile nanoscale materials that may be susceptible to oxidation or degradation in harsh 
synthetic conditions.
