Description:
Implemented in phenol-based polymeric backbones for creating cascade degradable nanoparticles sensitive to H2O2.

Text:
In contrast, boronatebased polymers have been extensively studied in the last 10 years because 
their sensitivity to H2O2 is in the submillimolar range.2627 Implementing boronic esters in a 
phenolbased polymeric backbone, Almutairi et al. reported in 2012 a cascade degradable 
nanoparticle sensitive to only 50 M of H2O2.28 This unique example of a nanocarrier sensitive 
to biologically relevant concentrations of H2O2 was, however, accompanied by poor control over
