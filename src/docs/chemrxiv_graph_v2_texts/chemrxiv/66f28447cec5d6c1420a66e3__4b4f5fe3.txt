Description:
High energy molecules that can be produced via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Text:
In future energy supply systems, powertoX (PtX) concepts can 
be incorporated as a solution for longterm energy storage of 
fluctuating renewable energy in form of high energy molecules, 
such as hydrogen, methane, or liquid hydrocarbons.1,2 One 
possibility for the production of such molecules is the Fischer
Tropsch (FT) synthesis, where hydrogen from water electrolysis 
reacts with CO from renewable sources to form a wide spectrum 
of aliphatic hydrocarbons (see R1  R2).3 
CO  (2 1)HCH HO

CO  2HCH HO

The CO hydrogenation is a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction 
and is usually carried out on supported transition metals, in 
particular Co, Fe and Ru, supported on various solid oxides, such 
as SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3 or CeO2 among others.4,5 Catalytic fixedbed 
reactors, such as those used for FT synthesis, are usually 
operated in stationary mode.
