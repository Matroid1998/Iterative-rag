Description:
An MRTADF emitter encapsulated with an ortho,orthodiDtCzPh group to reduce aggregation.

However, their typically planar structure also makes these materials 
prone to aggregationcased quenching (ACQ). Thus, MRTADF OLEDs typically use the 
emitter at very low doping concentrations, which results in a narrow recombination zone that 
contributes to the severe efficiency rolloff in the devices. The incorporation of bulky 
substituents on the MRTADF emitters has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to 
mitigate against the aggregation. Zhang et al.15 encapsulated the MRTADF core, DtBuCzB, 
with an ortho,orthodiDtCzPh group within DCzBN and an orthoCzPh group in SCzBN 
as a comparation (Figure S1) as a strategy to mitigate aggregation.
