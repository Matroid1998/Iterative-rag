Description:
A key reactant in the production of hydrocarbon fuels via the Fischer-Tropsch Process.

Text:
The assembly of complex molecules from carbon monoxide via CC bond formation represents 
a fundamental chemical challenge that has key relevance to the production of hydrocarbon fuels 
via the heterogeneous FischerTropsch Process.1 Although employed industrially since 1925, the 
mechanism for the conversion of mixtures of CO and H2 to shorttomedium chain alkane products 
through the formation of CC bonds remains the subject of significant debate.2 CC bond formation 
to yield alkenes represents a competing homologation process, and the product mixture typically 
also includes oxygenated species along with methane  an undesirable reduction product produced 
without accompanying CC bond formation. The idealized ratio of H2CO (ca. 21; eqn 1, typically 
with 10  n  20) reflects the importance of the reductant (H2) in generating the desired alkane 
products.
