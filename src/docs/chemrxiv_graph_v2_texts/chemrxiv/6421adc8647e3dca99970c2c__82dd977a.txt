A functional group that can form hydrogen bonds with either another thiol group or an oxygen of the carboxylate anion.

A low temperature study (30 K) of Form I5 showed that the thiol group is ordered with regular S
H...S bonds and a NCCS gauche (g) dihedral angle of 70.6. However, a neutron diffraction
study at room temperature3 showed disorder in the Form I lattice that can be modelled as
either involving just the thiol hydrogens or modelled using both sulfur and hydrogen atoms. The disorder arises because the hydrogen of the thiol group can form a hydrogen bond with
either another thiol group (as in the Form I 30 K crystal structure) or with an oxygen of the
carboxylate anion as shown in Figure 2.

an ordering transition of the thiol groups. In order to model the data it was necessary to use a
