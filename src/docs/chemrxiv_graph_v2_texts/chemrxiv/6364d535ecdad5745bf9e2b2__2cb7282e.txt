Description:
An impurity in capture streams that must be addressed in carbon capture processes.

Text:
However, CO2 concentration 
from atmosphere for this stepwise process must incur substantial energy and cost penalties 
(projected to be 9 GJ ton1 and 94232 ton1)4 to enable efficient carbon capture and utilization 
from dilute gas streams. This must also be addressed alongside common challenges in capture 
streams with impurities such as O2, NOx and SOx.8,9
