Description:
Structures based on V6O19 studied for their reactivity and redox chemistry.

Tailoring of these 
properties is, however, key to a variety of potential applications 
of switchable POMs, including multistate data storage, high
sensitivity nanoscale sensing, rechargeable batteries, etc.8 
The first experimental work investigating the structural 
characteristics, 
the 
reactivity 
against 
reduction 
and 
protonation, and the redox chemistry of Lindqvisttype V6O19
based (POV6) structures VV6O13(OCH2)3CR22 (R  NO2, 
CH2OH, Me) is that of Zubieta and coworkers,4 where the 
reduction and protonation of these tris(alkoxo) ligated 
complexess in solution were studied by simultaneous addition 
of electrons and cations. Densityfunctional theory (DFT) simulations2 of fully
oxidized POV6 ligated by different tris(alkoxo) ligands 
(OCH2)3CR revealed that the position of the lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital (LUMO), which is distributed between V 
atoms, is not considerably changed upon varying the type of the 
structurally exposed R group.
