For 
sustainable 
environment 
research on the Lowcost, scalable power 
storage cells are significantly increased, 
to overcome some of the limitations of 
organic redox flow battery1 and to 
enhance 
the 
power 
efficiency 
the 
introduction of a new type of hybrid cells 
derived from the bioinspired quinone
based 2, 3electron transport and 
storage unit is designed for the storage of 
the 
excess 
renewable 
energy 
produced4 mainly generated by tidal 
and solar energy5 and further use of the 
excess energy that is stored for further 
utilities. The metal and organic hybrid 
cells show promise for storing energy 
with excellent efficiency6, cost, and 
flexibility to allow those for largescale 
applications.
