Description:
A handle for bioorthogonal chemistry in functionalised linkers.

This is problematic, as owing to resistance issues, there is 
a need for novel targets, to prevent risk of crossresistance to current medications and those 
in clinical trials, and to provide combination therapies. Although new targets can and will be 
identified from phenotypic screening of diversity libraries followed by target deconvolution, 
more direct target identification approaches are now required to expand the number of 
chemically validated targets. The use of Fully Functionalised Fragments (FFF), as described by Cravatt and colleagues,4 
represents an alternative route to the identification of new and druggable targets. Each FFF 
consists of a fragment moiety attached to a functionalised linker containing both a photo
affinity group (typically a diazirine) and a handle for bioorthogonal chemistry (typically an 
alkyne) (Figure 1).
