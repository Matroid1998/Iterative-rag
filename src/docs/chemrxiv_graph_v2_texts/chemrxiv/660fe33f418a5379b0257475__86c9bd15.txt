13,14 In addition, the physicochemical properties as well as the catalytic activity can be 
tuned using synthesis doping strategy. 15,16,17 Among various TMOs applied for the CH4 
catalytic oxidation, Mn oxides such as MnOx, Mn2O3, MnOOH, and Mn3O4 have received 
much attention thanks to their specific physicochemical properties. 18,19 In the group of Mn oxide 
catalyst, MnO2 is a promising alternative to noble metals and is intensively applied for the CH4 
total conversion to H2O and CO2. An extensive illustration of the mechanism involved in CH4 total 
oxidation studied by Wang et al. and Hu et al., suggested that CH4 total oxidation over MnO2 may 
follow the LangmuirHinshelwood Mechanism (LH) with an indirect Marsvan Krevelen (MvK)
