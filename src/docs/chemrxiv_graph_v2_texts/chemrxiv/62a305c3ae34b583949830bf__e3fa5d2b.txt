Description:
Formed from the activation of ammonia and amines by Bi REC.

Text:
Herein we report on the 
synthesis, reactivity and structural characterization of a Bi REC, 
whose BiO homolyzes reversibly at room temperature without 
the need for irradiation (Fig. 1D). We demonstrate that such 
complex permits fast, and mild activation of ammonia and wa
teramong other alcohols and aminesresulting in wellde
fined Bi(III) amido and alkoxy compounds. We suggest that 
upon coordination to Bi(II), ammines and alcohols undergo X
H bond weakening, thus permitting their facile radical activa
tion. In addition, we propose that the novel pincerbased 
Bi(III)NR2 compounds show reactivity with a triad of H, H 
and H sources.
