Description:
A model pollutant with potential carcinogenicity and toxicity risks towards wildlife and human health.

Text:
Some substances, particularly aromatic compounds like chloro (CP),
nitro (NP) and other substituted phenols have been found to be persistent and biorefractory in the
aqueous environment and in waste water treatment plants 5. To date, there is a total of 19 existing
chlorinated phenols 6 but in this work, 2chlorophenol (2CP) will be evaluated as a model pollutant
given its potential carcinogenicity and toxicity risks towards wildlife and human health. 2CP is a
potent endocrine disrupting agent 7. It is classied as one of the priority pollutants by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency 8 and also listed in the European Parliament Decision No. 24552001EC 9 highlighting the stringent need of monitoring and regulation required for this
chemical.
