Description:
Used in carbon-supported form for H2 oxidation in anodic reactions, functioning as a reference electrode.

In addition, electrochemical reactions of gaseous substances can be conducted and nonpolar 
solvents can be used. The catalyst layers are composed of noble metals, carbon black, and an 
ionomer. They have a highly porous structure to provide an effective triplephase boundary for 
efficient electrochemical reactions. In addition, reactions are conducted in a flow operation. The anodic reaction in a PEM reactor is not problematic in principle as long as it is a proton
supplying reaction. In this situation, if H2 oxidation at carbonsupported Pt is selected as the anodic 
reaction, the anode also functions as a reference electrode because its potential is approximately 
the same as that of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).68 Therefore, in this case, the cathodic 
reaction can occur under potentiostatic conditions.
