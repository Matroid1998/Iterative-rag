Description:
Found in the earth's crust at approximately 0.5 parts per million as elemental mercury or as a sulfide.

Text:
Mercury (Hg) is found in the earths crust at approximately 0.5 parts per million (ppm) as 
35 
elemental mercury or as a sulfide.1 Outgassing from rock, volcanic activity, coal burning, and mining 
can release mercury into the atmosphere. Additionally, mercury can be introduced to marine 
ecosystems as a result of industrial runoff or discharge, such as in the events that occurred in 
Minamata Bay, Japan, in the 1950s and in commercial gold mining operations.24 As elemental or 
inorganic mercury enters the water cycle, it is converted into an organic compound, such as 
40 
methylmercury, by microorganisms.5 Once these microorganisms are consumed by smaller creatures 
and eventually by larger fish near or at the top trophic levels (e.g., tuna, swordfish, or shark, etc.
