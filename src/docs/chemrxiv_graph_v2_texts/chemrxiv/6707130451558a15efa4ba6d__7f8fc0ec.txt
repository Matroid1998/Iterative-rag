Description:
A natural source for the economical production of graphene through exfoliation.

The phenomenal rise of carbon allotropes such as graphene,1 
nanotubes, 2,3 and fullerenes, 4 has been continuously offering tech
nological advances in various fields, including photovoltaics, 5,6 bat
teries and supercapacitors, 710 membranes, 11,12 gas separation and 
storage, 13 chemical catalysis, 1416 and electronic sensors. 1719 It is 
quite fortunate that carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes can be easily 
produced on industrial scale by brute force methods  precipita
tion of carbon from the gas phase using metal catalysts or via an 
electric discharge between carbon electrodes, and that graphene 
can be economically produced by exfoliation from natural graphite 
sources. 14 
Schwarzites, a particularly elusive form of carbon allotropes, 
have generated considerable excitement, although synthesis re
mains unrealized.
