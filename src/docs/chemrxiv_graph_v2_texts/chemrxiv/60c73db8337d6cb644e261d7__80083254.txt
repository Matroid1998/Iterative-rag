Description:
Used in surface functionalization procedures for conductive and nonconductive materials.

Text:
We therefore sought to design a simpler process of 
fewer steps for graftingfrom reactions of diazonium salt layers. In this work, we present a surface functionalization 
procedure of only two overall steps for several conductive and 
nonconductive materials based on the spontaneous surface
