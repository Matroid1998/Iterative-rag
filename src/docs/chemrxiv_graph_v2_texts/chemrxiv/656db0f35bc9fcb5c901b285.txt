Description:
Atoms in the P(V) oxidation state important to chemistry, biology, and medicine.

Text:
Compounds containing one or more phosphorus atoms in the P(V) oxidation state are important to chemistry, biology, and 
medicine (Scheme 1A).1,2 These include marketed antiviral drugs such as such as Tenofovir alafenamide3 and Remdesivir, the 
latter being an effective treatment for the Ebola virus4 which was also approved for use against SARSCoV2.5,6 Other relevant 
compounds include Fosinopril,7 a compound used to treat hypertension and heart failure and WHO essential medicines listed 
chemotherapy agent Cyclophosphamide.8 In addition to being common APIs, P(V) containing compounds are also highly 
relevant motifs in agrochemistry.9 A representative example is the herbicide Zytron developed by Dow.10 As such, the 
development of efficient methods for the preparation of enantioenriched P(V) containing compounds is crucial.

Description:
A central atom in enantioselective desymmetrization reactions involving prochiral groups differentiated by a chiral catalyst.

Text:
The final strategy is an enantioselective desymmetrization by which prochiral groups linked to a 
phosphorus center are differentiated by a chiral catalyst (Scheme 1B, v). Multiple reactions have been developed using this 
strategy, however, until recently none have involved chemistry occurring at the P atom directly, but rather generate the P 
stereocenter indirectly (through manipulation of enantiotopic side chains) inherently limiting their scope.93145 
A strategically distinct enantioselective desymmetrization of P(V) species would involve an enantioselective nucleophilic 
substitution of enantiotopic leaving groups. By judicious choice of leaving group, nucleophile, and catalyst the desired 
enantioenriched species could be obtained in high yield and with excellent enantioselectivity (stage 1).
