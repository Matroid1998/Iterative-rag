Description:
A two-dimensional material with novel physical and chemical properties.

Text:
The discovery of graphene1 opens up the eld of two
dimensional (2D) materials such as hBN2, 3, 4, SiC5, 6,
phosphorene7, transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)8,
and MXenes9 for both theoretical and experimental re
search. These materials have drawn considerable inter
est due to their novel physical and chemical properties
compared to their threedimensional (3D) bulk counter
parts. Depending upon the crystal structure, most of the
TMDs exhibit substantial mechanical strength10 with
direct bandgap11, higher carrier mobility12, 13, and
strong spinorbit coupling (SOC)14. Unlike graphene and
many other 2D materials, the inplane asymmetry in TMDs
provides them with extraordinary thermoelectric and opto
electronic properties15, 16.
