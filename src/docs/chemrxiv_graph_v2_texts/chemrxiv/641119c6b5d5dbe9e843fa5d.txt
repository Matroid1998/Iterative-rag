Description:
A component of the Zr-based MOFL0.

Text:
Specifically, the reaction 
between a Zrbased MOFL0 (also known as pbzMOF163) 
and FeCl3 was shown to generate intermediate MOFs with ab
sorption that redshifts from 345 to 850 nm. Based on our mech
anistic studies, we assign this red shift in the observed optical 
bandgaps to the successive formation of MOFs with planarized 
ligands (MOFL6, also known as PCN13662) and absorption 
at 490 nm, MOFs with chlorinated and planarized ligands 
(MOFL6Cln) and absorption at 615 nm, MOFs with oxidized 
radical cation and dication ligands (MOFL6Cln and MOF
L6Cln2) and the lowestenergy absorption band at 800 nm. Scheme 1. Illustration of the progress of the MOF reaction 
with FeCl3.
