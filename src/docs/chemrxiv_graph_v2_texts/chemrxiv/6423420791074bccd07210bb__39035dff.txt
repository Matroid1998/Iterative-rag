Description:
Used in metal and fluoride-free one-pot procedures for the direct reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones.

Text:
In previous work with 1hydrosilatrane, we developed 
metal and fluoridefree onepot procedures for the direct 
reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones to 2 and 3 
amines.17,18 We envisioned it might be possible to intercept 
the imine intermediate instead with 1allylsilatrane to form 
new CC bonds during the course of reductive amination 
and produce valuable building blocks that are amenable to 
further modifications. While not yet commercially available, 
1allylsilatrane can be synthesized from readily available 
starting materials on a multigram scale in high yields.1922 
Herein, we report a metal and fluoridefree procedure to 
access benzaldehyde and anilinederived homoallylic 
amines using 1allylsilatrane. Scheme 1 Three component reactions to access 
homoallylic amines using allylsilanes.
