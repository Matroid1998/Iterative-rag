Description:
A conducting polymer with a rigid backbone and limited solubility in common organic solvents.

Although the electrospun fibers 
9 
can potentially be used in many large volume applications,4,1820 a fundamental understanding of 
10 
the processingstructureproperty relationships for the electrospinning process of CPs is still 
11 
incomplete. 12 
Among different CPs, the electrospinning of poly(3alkylthiophene) (P3AT), especially poly(3
13 
hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has been investigated in the past.5,2022 CPs generally have lower 
14 
molecular weight and are less flexible because of their rigid backbone, and have limited solubility 
15 
in common organic solvents.23 As a result, CPs usually do not reach the sufficient chain 
16 
entanglements in the solution required to form fibers through the electrospinning process.
