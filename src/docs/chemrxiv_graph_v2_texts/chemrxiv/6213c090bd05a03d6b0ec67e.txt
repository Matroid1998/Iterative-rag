Description:
A polymer used to functionalize chromophores for improved water solubility and biocompatibility.

Since its invention in the late 1990s twophoton fluorescence 
microscopy has experienced impressive developments,12 and 
has opened unprecedented perspectives in tissues imaging that 
have substantially benefited such diverse fields as neurobiol
ogy,3 physiology,4 embryology5 and tissue engineering.6 These 
developments have been achieved thanks to combined advances 
in the optical setups design and in the developments of increas
ingly sophisticated and selective endogenous (green fluorescent 
proteins)7 and exogenous (synthetic organic chromophores and 
nanoparticles) fluorescent contrast agents.811 
In this framework, the conception of molecular probes or nano
objects that combine sizeable twophoton induced emission 
properties with good solubility (or colloidal stability) in physi
ological media has been a major issue, on which we have been 
extensively working in recent years.1214 
In previous reports, we have proposed chromophore function
alization with water solubilizing poly(hydroxyethylacrylate) 
(PHEA) polymeric side chains as a relevant approach to achieve 
high biocompatibility of molecular bioprobes.15 We have 
shown that this functionalization could efficiently shield the 
molecule from interactions with its local environment, ensuring 
solubility of inherently lipophilic and pronetostacking fluoro
phores into aqueous media, and keeping luminescence efficien
cies high.
