Description:
A subgroup in nonconventional luminescent polymers (NCLPs) represented by NHCO.

Recently, nonconjugated polymers with intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) have 
attracted considerable attention.1, 2 Generally, these nonconventional luminescent 
polymers (NCLPs) consist of certain subgroups, such as acylamino (NHCO), 
carbonyl (CO), hydroxyl (OH), or cyano (CN).39 It is generally accepted that the 
emission of NCLPs is due to the clustering of nonconjugated chromophores and 
through space conjugation (TSC) effect, namely, clusteringtriggered emission (CTE).1, 
8, 1015 By taking advantage of the straightforward processability of polymers, NCLPs 
have potential for applications in anticounterfeiting, sensors, bioimaging, etc. Polymerization is the process to create polymers, and the chosen polymerization 
route and conditions determine the fundamental features of a polymer, including 
composition, configuration, molecular weight, dispersity, and functionalization, to 
name but a few.
