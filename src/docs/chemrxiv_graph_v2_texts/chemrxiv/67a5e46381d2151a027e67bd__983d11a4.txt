Description:
A sugar-derived biobased packaging material with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and comparable mechanical properties to PET.

Durability, gas and water barrier properties, 
transparency, and low cost makes this material ideal for manufacturing singleuse food and beverage 
containers.4 However, the fate of these manufacts after their use is still far from being environmentally 
sustainable.5 Moreover, the synthesis of these polymers is sourced by fossil raw materials, whose 
availability is limited and the value chain is highly energy demanding.6 Finally, PET recycling is still not an 
attractive solution because processed materials lose most their properties and the treatment is 
economically disadvantageous compared to the production from fossil fuel monomers.7 
To address these challenges, biobased packaging materials have emerged as a promising alternative to 
reduce the carbon footprint and to lower environmental impact than petroleumbased plastics.6 A 
remarkable example is the sugarderived polyethylene2,5furan dicarboxylate (PEF), which combines 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions during synthesis with nontoxicity and comparable mechanical 
properties to PET, positioning it as a valuable potential substitute in the near future.8 
In this scenario, finding efficient solutions for the sustainable and efficient upcycling of plastic debris is 
mandatory.
