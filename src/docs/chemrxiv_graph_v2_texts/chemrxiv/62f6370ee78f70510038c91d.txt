Description:
A solid substrate commonly used for forming supported lipid bilayers.

Text:
They can be used to investigate interactions between membranes
and drug molecules and the response of membranes to physical stimuli.15 Research into
bacterial membranes as drug targets for antimicrobial treatments has led to the develop
ment of several planar mimetic systems which facilitate investigation by surface sensitive
techniques.68
Membrane models comprised solely of lipids or lipid mixtures are an important tool for
understanding membrane biophysics.9, 10 Such systems are drastically simplied compared
to living systems, but they provide good control and allow detailed structural studies of
membrane behaviour and interactions with relevant agents, such as proteins, peptides, and
DNA.11
Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) are lipid bilayers formed on a solid substrate, most com
monly silicon or quartz.
