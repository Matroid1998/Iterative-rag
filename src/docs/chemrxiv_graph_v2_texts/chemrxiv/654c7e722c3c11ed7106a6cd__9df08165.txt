Description:
A widely used photocatalyst due to its high reactivity and stability.

Photocatalysis involves the use of a semiconductor catalyst and light to produce highly reactive 
species, such as hydroxyl radicals, that can oxidize and degrade organic pollutants into possibly 
harmless products. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a widely used photocatalyst due to its high 
reactivity and stability, and the most used photocatalyst for wastewater treatment ((S.J. Armakovi, M.M. Savanovi, S. Armakovi, Titanium dioxide as the most used photocatalyst for 
water purification an overview. Catalysts. 13, 26 (2022).)). However, TiO2 can only absorb UV 
light, which makes up a small portion of the solar spectrum.
