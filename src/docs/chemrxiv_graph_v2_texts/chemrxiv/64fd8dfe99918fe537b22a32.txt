Description:
A gas that can be captured and separated using covalent organic frameworks.

In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a highly promising 
class of crystalline porous polymers, which possess unique structures composed of a network 
of dynamic covalent bonds.1 Owing their unique structures, COFs possess a large void space 
and a high surface area, which render them have the capacity to be used in capturing and 
separating hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and other gases.24 Besides, COFs are promising 
catalytic platforms because of their abundant uniform and open channels as well as the 
excellent insolubility nature and high stability, which are crucial to the mass transfer process 
in catalysis.5,6 The highly efficient size selectivity of COFs due to their uniform pores also 
renders them can be employed as highly efficient and sizeselective catalysts.7 Meanwhile, 
COFs have been designed as potential Li ion solidstate conductors as well as the flexible 
electronics, since most of them are flexible and have the high conductivities among the reported 
crystalline porous materials.8,9 
Among different types of COFs, twodimensional (2D) COFs are currently receiving 
much attention due to their unique structural properties.
