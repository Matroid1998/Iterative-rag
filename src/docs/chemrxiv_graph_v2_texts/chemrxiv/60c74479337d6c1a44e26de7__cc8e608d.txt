Description:
A product formed from 1,413C2fumarate by the enzyme fumarase in the citric acid cycle.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a powerful, 
noninvasive medical technique, but has limitations due 
to the intrinsic low sensitivity. To overcome this problem, 
it is possible to hyperpolarize the nuclear spins, a 
procedure that has been shown to produce signal 
enhancements of biomolecules up to 105 at high field 
1,2. Unfortunately, the hyperpolarization decays in 
(typically) tens of seconds due to spin relaxation. Despite 
this temporal limitation, it is possible to observe realtime 
cellular metabolism in vitro and in vivo after injection of 
hyperpolarized metabolites 36. One 
promising 
candidate 
metabolite 
is 
1,413C2fumarate, 
which 
is 
converted 
to 
1,413C2malate by the enzyme fumarase in one step of 
the citric acid cycle.
