Description:
A product of methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation that can strongly adsorb on catalysts.

In response to these challenges, we introduce a machine learning approach that 
guides design of catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of methyl cyclohexane to 
toluene. This particular liquid organic hydrogen carrier is selected because it has been 
demonstrated in pilot plant and more or less ready to be scaled up by industry21,22. The 
endothermic dehydrogenation reaction necessitates high temperatures, typically 
above 500 K, and requires a catalyst23. While Pt is a promising catalyst for methyl 
cyclohexane dehydrogenation, its high cost and low selectivity to toluene hinder the 
widespread applications24. Toostrong adsorption of toluene leads to undesirable side 
products like benzene, bibenzyltoluene, and coke, diminishing the efficacy of this 
technology25.
