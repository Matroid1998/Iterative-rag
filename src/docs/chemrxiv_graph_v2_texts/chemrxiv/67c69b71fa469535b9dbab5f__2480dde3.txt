determined molar yield of cisresveratrol generated from transresveratrol 
excitation (in a hydroalcoholic solution exposed to solar irradiation) was 
approximately 60 and underwent significant degradation after 150 minutes.12 
This interconversion was detailed in several computational and experimental 
works, demonstrating that the isomerization process is consistently observed for 
transresveratrol, in both solution and solid phases. 11,13 
In addition to isomerization, photoexcited resveratrol can undergo reactions that 
result in byproducts (Figure 1).
