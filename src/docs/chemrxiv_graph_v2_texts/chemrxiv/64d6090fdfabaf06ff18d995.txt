Description:
A functional group characterized by a carbonyl group bonded to two hydrocarbon groups.

An 
125 
aphenyl substrate cyclized to yield the desired blactam 2m in 71 yield and complete diastereo and 
126 
regioselectivity (201 d.r., 201 r.r.). aAryl substrates with electrondonating groups in the 4position also 
127 
successfully cyclized, with higher yields correlating with more electronrich arenes. 4Methyl substrate yielded b
128 
lactam 2n in 79 yield (201 d.r., 201 r.r.) and 4methoxy substrate cyclized to give 2o in 82 yield (201 d.r., 
129 
201 r.r.) respectively. Xray crystallography allowed us to confirm the relative stereochemistry of blactam 2o, 
130 
illustrating that the cyclization occurs to place the asubstituent syn to the ketone. Substrates bearing aromatic rings 
131 
with relatively weak electronwithdrawing substituents such as 4fluoroaryl 2p (74, 201 d.r., 201 r.r.
