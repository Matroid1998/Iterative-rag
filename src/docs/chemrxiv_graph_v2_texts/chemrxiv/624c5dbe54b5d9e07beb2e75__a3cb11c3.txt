Description:
Bulky Lewis acids capable of activating H2.

Text:
Ashley and coworkers 
demonstrated for the first time the prospect of H2 activation by the 
bulky Lewis acids B(C6Cl5)x(C6F5)3x x 0 to 3 in THF solvent which 
was followed by hydrogenation of imine.5e Herein, we have tried to 
understand if there is a role of the Lewis basic diglyme solvent as a 
hidden partner of the Lewis acidic bisborane system in developing a 
FLP like cooperativity in the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB. Our 
previous experiences with computational design based monoboron 
based dehydrogenating systems have shown that action of solvent
