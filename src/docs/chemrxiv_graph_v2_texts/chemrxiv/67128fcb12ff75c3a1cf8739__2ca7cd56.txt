Involved in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.

Electrification of the petrochemical industry has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions in the manufacturing of commodity chemicals; however, electrification on a global scale 
is only achievable using earthabundant materials for electrocatalysis in place of stateoftheart catalysts 
made from precious metals. Nickel phosphide (Ni2P) is a promising earthabundant catalyst that has 
been used for industrial hydrodesulfurization,1,2 as well as electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution,3,4 nitrate 
reduction,5 carbon dioxide reduction,6 and oxygen evolution.7,8 Ni2P and other transition metal 
phosphides benefit from active site ensembles that moderate the binding of reaction intermediates 
compared to their pure metal counterparts.3,9 This makes metal phosphides promising electrocatalysts 
for reactions beyond those listed, especially for other hydrogenation reactions.
