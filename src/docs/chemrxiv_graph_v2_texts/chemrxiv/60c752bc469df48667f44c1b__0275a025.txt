Description:
A solvent used for crystallizing compounds to form suitable crystals for X-ray crystallographic analysis.

Text:
1Hydroxy4,5benzohydroxytropylium 4a, 4b and 4c could be crystalized from CH2Cl2 to form pale yellow crystals 
that were suitable for Xray crystallographic analysis. The ORTEP drawings of 4a, 4b and 4c are shown in Figure 
1 and the structural parameters are summarized in Table 1. The molecular structures of 4a and 4c were slightly 
distorted, and the C2 and C7 carbons of 4a4c deviated from the mean plane of the 4,5benzotropylium ring by
