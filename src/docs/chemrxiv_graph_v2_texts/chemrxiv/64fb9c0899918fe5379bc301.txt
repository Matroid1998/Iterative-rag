Developing chromatographic methods for acylCoAs is challenging due to their structural 
53 
complexity. These compounds exhibit significant variations in their physicochemical properties 
54 
by factors such as carbon chain length, degree of saturation, and the presence of functional 
55 
groups1517. Additionally, acylCoAs have low endogenous levels and are highly unstable 
56 
in aqueous solutions. Due to these reasons they are susceptible to hydrolysis, making sample 
57 
preparation challenging and resulting in poor recovery and low signal intensity15,18. The 
58 
quantification of acylCoAs has previously been accomplished using a variety of analytical 
59 
techniques, such as gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and reversed phase liquid 
60 
chromatography (RPLC) coupled to UV or fluorescence detection1922.
