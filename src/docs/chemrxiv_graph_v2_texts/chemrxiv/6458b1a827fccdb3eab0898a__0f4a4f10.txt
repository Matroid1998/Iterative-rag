Clean and sustainable energy production and storage is the major challenge for mankind today 14. Although clean energy can be produced economically from aeolian, hydro, solar, etc., only a minor 
part is stored, since as yet, there is no perfect energy storage technology 5. Hydrogen offers a viable 
approach with a large storage capacity of 142 MJkg. At present, more than 95 of the hydrogen 
produced is obtained by steam methane reforming. Although this is the most efficient technology 
known at present ( 70 efficiency 6), this way of producing hydrogen is far from being clean or 
sustainable, since for every ton of hydrogen produced, 2 to 9 tons of CO2 are emitted depending on 
the details of the process.

Description:
Produced via water electrolysis using electricity from renewable sources.

Text:
Water dissociation into H2 and O2 through electrolysis, offers an alternative 
for hydrogen production, particularly when using electricity from renewable sources. An important 
amount of external electrical energy input is mandatory to overcome the water redox potential of 1.23 
V (1.6 V if we consider overpotentials at the electrodes). As an example, an industrial electrolyser 
producing 750 Nm3h consumes an electrical energy of approx. 5 kWh for each Nm3 of H2 produced 
7.
