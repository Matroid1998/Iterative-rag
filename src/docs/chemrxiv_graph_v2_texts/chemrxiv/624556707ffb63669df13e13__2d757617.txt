Description:
Reacts to form vinylidene carbene.

Vi
nylic SN1 or SN2 or reactions via alkylidene carbene intermedi
ates are common, whereas Michael additions are less likely.1922 
Vinylidene carbene formation has also been proposed in reac
tions with alkynyliodonium salts2324 and EBX.2526 Mechanistic 
studies of the latter revealed that thiol alkynylation can proceed 
via ligand coupling or Michaeltype addition depending on the 
electronics of the reagent.2526 
To increase the utility of VBX as an efficient vinylating agent, 
tools to understand and predict the principles for product regio
chemistry are important. Based on literature precedent, several 
possible mechanisms could be proposed to explain the observed 
regiochemistry (Scheme 1c).
