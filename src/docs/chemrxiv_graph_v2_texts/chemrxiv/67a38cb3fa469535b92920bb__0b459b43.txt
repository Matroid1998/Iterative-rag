Description:
A complex designed with a hydrophobic membrane to increase loading capacity and enable pH-sensitive release.

To further en
hance tumour targeting, the microcarrier is functionalized with drugloaded Psomes containing a curcu
min complex (CU(CD)2), designed with a hydrophobic membrane to increase loading capacity and en
able pHsensitive release. In summary, this study aims to establish a multifunctional robotic platform to 
advance localized and targeted therapy to enhance treatment outcomes from a functional and structural 
point of view. To this end, the following key objectives have been addressed (i) Selection of a well
established microcarrier featuring TiFe and Au outer discrete multicoating for magnetic guidance and 
photoacoustic imaging applications. This microcarrier is chosen for its adaptability and biological activity, 
allowing for the decoration with specific therapeutic nanoreservoirs tailored to distinct therapeutic win
dows (e.g., controlled release of antitumor drugs and extracellular enzymatic therapeutics).
