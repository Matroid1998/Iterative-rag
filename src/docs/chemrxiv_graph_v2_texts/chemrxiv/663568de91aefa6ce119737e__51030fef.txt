Description:
Involved in catalysis and forms complexes with metals, important for understanding metalligand chemical bonding.

Text:
Molecular oxygens ready ability to form stable complexes with transition metals is crucial for
cellular respiration, profitable for the industrial use of many catalysts, and interesting for under
standing the fundamental forces at play in metalligand chemical bonding.14 Voluminous studies
report the reactivity of heme5 and Vaskas complex6 with small molecules, particularly O2, attest
ing to the high level of biochemical and organometallic interest in dioxygen catalysis. The breadth
of these metalO2 species is notable.

Description:
A ligand with versatile binding modes, forming superoxo or peroxo species.

Text:
Various elements, oxidation states, and doccupancies can be
observed in the transition metal centers7 and diverse reactivity, binding modes, and a distribution
in the extent of OO bond activation (typically 1.2 to 1.5 A) in the O2 ligands.8 Nonetheless, on
the basis of spectroscopic, structural, and magnetic measurements, metalO2 compounds can gen
erally be dichotomized according to the electronic character of the dioxygen superoxo (O2 ) or
peroxo (O22).7 Peroxometal adducts constitute the majority of this family9 and tend to feature
elongated, sideon bound OO moieties, 1.4 to 1.5 A. Superoxometal species, on the other hand,
often have shorter, endon OO units, 1.2 to 1.3 A.9 And yet despite the versatility of dioxygen as
a ligand, the maximum known ratio of peroxide ligands to metal center is four10 in the homoleptic
tetraperoxo metal complexes of the form M(2O2)4.
