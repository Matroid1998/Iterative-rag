Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction pathway for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production.

Text:
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been widely used as a clean oxidant in industrial processes, such 
as organic synthesis,1 disinfection,2 water treatment,3 etc. Photocatalysis provides a green 
way for H2O2 production in contrast to the industrially applied anthraquinone process,4 since 
the latter is an energy intensive process that requires large amounts of organic solvents, making 
it environmentally unfriendly. The primary pathways of photocatalytic H2O2 production include 
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the water oxidation reaction (WOR). The 
photoinduced WOR pathway for H2O2 generation is a twohole pathway (eq 1).
