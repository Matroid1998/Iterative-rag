Description:
Known to be unstable in the presence of lithium-based battery anodes.

Especially for alternative alkaline batteries employing sodium or potassium, some very sim
ilar challenges remain compared to those known for lithium batteries.14,15 Commonly used
electrolyte components like ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl
carbonate (DMC), and dimethoxyethane (DME), LiPF6, LiBF4, and LiTFSI, are known to
be unstable in the presence of lithiumbased battery anodes, leading to the formation of a
passivation layer known as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).16 The SEI formation poses
one of the main limitations in the insufficient cycling stability of the battery, leading either
to a reduced battery capacity or, in the worst case, a catastrophic thermal runaway.10 At
