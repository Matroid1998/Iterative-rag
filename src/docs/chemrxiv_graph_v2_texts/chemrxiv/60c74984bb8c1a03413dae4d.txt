Description:
Constitutes the primary electron donor in the reaction center of photosynthetic systems.

Text:
The mechanism of natural photosynthesis can conveniently be divided into several distinct
steps 1 i) light harvesting in antenna proteins, ii) a fast primary electrontransfer event
in the reaction center (RC), iii) protein stabilization due to charge separation, and iv)
subsequent steps involving the synthesis of new chemical compounds. In the rst step,
the photosynthetic system does not undergo any chemical transformations and simply
transfers the absorbed energy to the RC. The RC contains (bacterio)chlorophyll (B)Chl
molecule(s), which constitute the primary electron donor. For the cases of green plants,
algae, and cyanobacteria, two primary electron donors are known P700 in photosys
tem I (PSI) and P680 in photosystem II (PSII) 1.
