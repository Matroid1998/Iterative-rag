Description:
Bridging ligands that facilitate magnetic interactions in Mn12 clusters.

Text:
If magnetic anisotropy is present in such a system, it shows MNM properties.23, 
24 An MNM of this type stands behind the success story of the whole field as it was indeed started by the 
discovery of a dodecanuclear carboxylatebridged cluster Mn12  a highspin molecule (S  10) comprising 
eight MnIII and four MnIV ions interacting magnetically via the bridging carboxylate ligands.2527 However, 
the indirect character of these magnetic interactions, based on weak superexchange coupling mechanism, 
limits the performance of Mn12 to very low temperatures, below the boiling point of liquid helium.
