Description:
Has two naturally occurring isotopes, 10B and 11B, both of which are NMR active.

Text:
Unlike 1H and 13C with a nuclear spin I  , both naturally occurring isotopes of boron i.e. 10B (I  3) and 11B 
(I  52) are NMR active; however, the latter is more versatile than the erstwhile for NMR investigations by 
virtue of the fact that 10B has a natural abundance of only 19.6, whereas 11B exhibits a natural abundance of 
80.4,1 as such 10B comes with a much lower receptivity i.e. receiver gain, and quadrupole moment almost 
thrice as much as that for 11B, which broadens 10B NMR signals. Moreover, the Larmor frequency of 10B is 
almost three times lower than that for 11B, resulting in a much lower signal resolution and coupling constants i.e.

Description:
The isotope 11B is more versatile for NMR investigations due to its higher natural abundance and lower quadrupole moment compared to 10B.

Description:
NMR spectroscopy is advantageous in elucidating structures of boron compounds and their behavior in solutions.

J (in Hz) in 10B NMR spectra.2 Despite these drawbacks 10B NMR can be particularly useful in niche 
mechanistic studies such as rearrangements.3 
NMR spectroscopy much to contemporary efforts has proved exceptionally advantageous in elucidating 
structures of boron compounds, and their behaviour in solutions.4,5 The extrapolation of NMR activities of other 
common NMR active nuclei such as 1H, 13C, 15N, 31P etc., to 11B NMR suggests that the following factors should 
determine chemical shifts () in 11B NMR spectra 

Electron density 

Coordination number 

Hybridisation 

Ring current

However, the above is found not to be true for many 11B NMR spectra.
