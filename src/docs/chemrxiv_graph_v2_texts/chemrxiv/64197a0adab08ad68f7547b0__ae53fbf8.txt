Description:
A compound involved in thiol exchange reactions and signal amplification.

Text:
This 
strategy, first described by Anslyn and coworkers9, detects thiol signals indirectly via thiol
exchange mediated release of BME and its subsequent reaction with a Meldrums acidbased 
reagent. Once initiated, the reaction converts one equivalent of BME or DTT to decouple two 
equivalents of thiol. Using this approach, the authors were able to amplify initial thiol input and 
convert it to macroscopic material degradation and optical detection.15 Inspired by these 
concepts, we sought to develop a new strategy for creating soft polymeric materials that are 
able to recognize, amplify and translate (bio)chemically relevant signals into global 
macroscopic material changes, regardless the quantities or molecular size of the applied 
signal.
