Description:
Involved in electrochemical adsorption on catalyst surfaces during the HER process.

Text:
The process of the catalytic HER is often regarded as the VolmerTafel and the VolmerHeyrovsky 
mechanism. Both mechanisms involve electrochemical hydrogen adsorption, hydrogen atoms were 
adsorbed on active atoms of the catalyst to form adsorbed H Volmer reaction (Equation 1), then 
followed by the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms to produce H2 molecule Tafel 
reaction (Equation 2) or the reaction between one adsorbed hydrogen and a solvated proton from the 
water layer to form a H2 molecule Heyrovsky reaction (Equation 3).1

MHads signifies a H atom adsorbed on the surfaceactive atoms of the catalysts.

VolmerTafel mechanism Platinum, as a wellknown catalyst for HER, is thought to follow the this 
process2, which requires the combination of two MHads species. The observed bond length of the 
hydrogen molecule is just 0.74,3 but the distance between two neighbouring atoms in pure platinum 
(cubic, space group Fm3m) is 2.774.4 This demonstrates that the distance between nearby platinum 
atoms is 3.74 times the length of the hydrogen bond, and that extra energy is required for atomic 
hydrogen transfer across a long distance. In the VolmerHeyrovsky mechanism, the MHads is formed 
during the first Volmer stage, there is no obvious and persuasive procedure to explain adsorbing 
another H atom from water to form a H2 molecule.
