Description:
Used in nanoprisms to reduce photobleaching rates and enhance photostability.

This is particularly critical in fields
such as superresolution microscopy, where prolonged ob
servation times are necessary, or in solar energy harvesting,
where consistent performance over extended periods is essen
tial1821. a)These authors contributed equally to this work. Various strategies have been developed to enhance chro
mophore stability and prevent oxidation. A particularly
promising approach involves coupling chromophores to
nanoparticle surface plasmons or optical cavities2224. This
method exploits strong lightmatter interactions to mod
ify excited state dynamics25,26, creating new relaxation
pathways that compete with harmful triplet state forma
tion. Notable demonstrations include the 100fold reduc
tion in photobleaching rates for Jaggregates coupled to sil
ver nanoprisms17, and the enhanced photostability of P3HT
polymer in silver mirror cavities16.
