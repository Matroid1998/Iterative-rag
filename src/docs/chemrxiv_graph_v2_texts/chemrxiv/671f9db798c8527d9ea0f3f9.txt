Description:
A key element in lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used for energy storage but have limited and geopolitically restricted resources.

Text:
As the world transitions towards sustainable energy solutions, the demand for efficient, cost 
effective and abundant energy storage systems is escalating. Sodiumion batteries (SIB) emerge 
as a compelling alternative to the widely applied lithiumion battery (LIB), primarily due to 
the ample and lowcost nature of sodium1. Since lithium resources (and other elements 
necessary for LIBs) are limited and geopolitically restricted, the need for a more readily 
available and environmentally benign option is critical2. SIBs not only promise a reduction in 
material cost but also exhibit significant potential for largescale energy storage applications, 
essential for balancing renewable energy sources like solar and wind3. Their continued 
development could play a pivotal role in addressing the global energy crisis, fostering energy 
security, and promoting a greener future.
