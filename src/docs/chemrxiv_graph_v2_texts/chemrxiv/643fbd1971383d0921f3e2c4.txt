Description:
A molecule with inversion symmetry, often used to study the effects of symmetry rules in chemical processes.

Thus symmetry se
lection rules play a pivotal role in the formation of a
RIXS spectrum, and can be analyzed both in terms of
dipole transition moments and point group symmetry. Often if V E0V Eiis forbidden as a direct tran
sition, the corresponding RIXS channel may be allowed
in the three level scattering process10, 11. This opens
up an avenue to observe optical dark states. However
the purely electronic symmetry selection and propensity
rules can be broken in the presence of vibronic couplings
as has been extensively discussed earlier 6. The eect
of breakage and restoration of these symmetry rules are
most interesting and profound in molecules having inver
sion symmetry, of which SF6 is a particularly interesting
example.12, 13.
