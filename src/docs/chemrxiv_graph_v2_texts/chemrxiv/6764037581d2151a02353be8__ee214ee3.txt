Description:
An element used in drug formulations for its diverse applications.

If unaddressed, AMR is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths 
annually by 2050, surpassing cancer as a leading cause of mortality (ONeill, 2016). The pharmaceutical industry 
relies heavily on elements such as aluminium and potassium due to their diverse applications in drug formulations. Aluminiumbased compounds, such as aluminium hydroxide, are widely used as antacids to manage gastric 
acidity, while aluminium sulfate serves as a vaccine adjuvant to enhance immune responses (Sweetman, 2011; 
WHO, 2019). Similarly, potassiumbased compounds play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance in the 
body. For example, potassium chloride is commonly used to treat hypokalemia and prevent cardiac arrhythmias, 
whereas potassium citrate helps manage kidney stones by increasing urinary citrate excretion (Kaplan, 2018; 
Curhan et al., 1993).

Description:
Nanoparticles exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through mechanisms such as oxidative stress induction, cell membrane disruption, and inhibition of protein synthesis.

Text:
Despite their benefits, prolonged exposure to aluminium and potassium compounds may 
pose health risks, including neurotoxicity and renal complications (Reinke et al., 2010; Yokel  Sjgren, 2009). Recent advances in nanotechnology have introduced aluminium and potassium nanoparticles as promising 
antimicrobial agents due to their unique physicochemical properties. These nanoparticles exhibit broadspectrum 
antibacterial activity against Grampositive and Gramnegative bacteria through mechanisms such as oxidative 
stress induction, cell membrane disruption, and inhibition of protein synthesis (Vashistha et al., 2021; Aqib et al., 
2021). Studies have demonstrated that aluminium nanoparticles effectively inhibit pathogens like Escherichia coli 
and Staphylococcus aureus, with reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values as low as 10 gmL 
(Girma et al., 2021).

Description:
Used in the synthesis of metal nanoparticles with antibacterial activity.

Text:
The potential of nanoparticles to bypass conventional antibiotic resistance mechanisms 
makes them a valuable tool in combating drugresistant bacterial infections (Ozdal  Grkk, 2021; Gautam et 
al., 2021). The aqueous extract of Polyalthia longifolia has emerged as a natural, ecofriendly resource for 
synthesizing nanoparticles. Rich in phytochemicals, the extract acts as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the 
synthesis of metal nanoparticles, including aluminium and potassium (Mumtaz et al., 2022). These green
synthesized nanoparticles have demonstrated potent antibacterial activity, with MIC values as low as 0.039 
mgmL against Staphylococcus aureus, along with significant zones of inhibition against pathogens such as 
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Savu et al., 2022; Parvin et al., 2013).
