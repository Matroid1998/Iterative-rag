Description:
Considered as an alternative to lithium in battery technologies.

Text:
One wellestablished
method is the electrochemical storage of energy in rechargeable batteries, with lithiumbased
batteries, in particular, having revolutionized energy storage for all sorts of electronic de
vices.1,2 Lithiumbased batteries alone, however, will not solve todays energy storage prob
lems as they face a variety of challenges, ranging from limited resource availability3 of crucial
battery components over limited battery lifetimes4 to serious safety concerns.5 To combat
the increasing resource shortages associated with lithium batteries and provide affordable
and environmentally sustainable energy storage for the foreseeable future, research efforts
with regards to alternative battery types have increased tremendously.613 Alternatives to
the current generation of lithium batteries include other alkaline batteries, replacing lithium
with sodium or potassium, as well as batteries using magnesium, calcium, or aluminum.
