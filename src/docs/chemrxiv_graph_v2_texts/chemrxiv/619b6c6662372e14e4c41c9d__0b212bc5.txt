Description:
Formed from the conversion of carboxylic acids promoted by NbCl5.

Text:
According to 
6, NbCl5 promotes the conversion of carboxylic acids into 
carboxamides. In this work, in order to study the possibility of 
conversion 
of 
carboxylic 
acids 
under 
the 
conditions 
of 
organotantalum synthesis, we studied the reaction of carboxylic 
acids with secondary amines in the presence of catalytic amounts of 
TaCl5. Results and discussion
