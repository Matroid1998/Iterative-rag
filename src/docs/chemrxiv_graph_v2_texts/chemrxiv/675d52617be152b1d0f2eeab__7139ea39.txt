Description:
A type of mesoionic imine based on a MIC platform, recently reported.

Text:
Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are an important class of reactive organic molecules used as ligands and 
organocatalysts (Scheme 1).1 Triazolylidenebased mesoionic carbenes (MICs) are a comparatively new 
class of carbenes that have been popularized in recent years.2 Just like NHCs, Nheterocyclic imines 
(NHIs) are another significant class of ligands that are derived from the NHC scaffold with a highly 
polarised exocyclic CN bond (Scheme 1).3 Due to their high electrondonating ability, NHIs have found 
numerous applications in stabilizing various lowvalent main group and transition metal compounds.4 
Since the first report of NHIs by Kuhn and coworkers in 1995,5 several other types of imines based on 
different carbene scaffolds and their reactivities have been reported by the groups of Tamm,6 Inoue,7 
Braunschweig, 8 and others.9 Among these, the 1,2,3triazolin5imine type mesoionic imine (MII) based 
on a MIC platform is one of the newest members, recently reported by us and others.1011 Just like NHCs, 
NHIs as well as MIIs can react with carbondioxide to form zwitterionic MIICO2 adduct (Scheme 1).
