Description:
Produces a deformation-dependent electrical potential when mechanically stretched in hydrogels.

For instance, the compressive deformations of co
polymer hydrogels of polyacrylic acid (PAA) were shown
to generate electrostatic potentials on order several mil

livolts 4. Similarly, polymethacrylic hydrogels respond
to mechanical stretching by producing a deformation
dependent electrical potential 5. The emergence of
such electrostatic responses was attributed to changes
in the ionic distribution throughout the deformed hy
drogel structure. In accord, the coarsegrained molec
ular dynamics (MD) simulation studies, in which the sol
vent was modeled implicitly (i.e., no solvent molecules
were present in the simulations) with a uniform dielec
tric constant, demonstrated enhanced electrostatic in
teractions between counterions and hydrogel backbone
charges under mechanical compression 18, suggesting a
deformationdependent counterion condensation.
