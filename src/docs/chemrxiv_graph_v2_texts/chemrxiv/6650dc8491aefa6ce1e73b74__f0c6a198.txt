Description:
Highly valuable compounds in fields ranging from photophysical applications to coordination chemistry, often displaying aromaticity.

The incorporation of phosphorus into heterocyclic 
systems can lead to significant changes in their 
properties 
and 
reactivity. Phospholes, 
first 
synthesised in 1959,1 have emerged as highly 
valuable compounds in numerous fields ranging from 
photophysical applications to coordination chemistry, 
and often display aromaticity.25 Utilising phosphorus 
alongside its lighter group 15 congener, nitrogen, can 
bestow 
further 
reactivity 
in 
the 
heterocycle, 
particularly when featuring a direct PVN bond. This 
arises due to the highly polarised nature of the PVN 
bond, which yields significant singlebond character 
and a more basic nitrogen centre.
