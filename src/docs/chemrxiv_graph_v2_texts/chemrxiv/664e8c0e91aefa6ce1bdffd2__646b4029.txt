Description:
A redox-active molecule that can generate nucleophilic sites via reduction.

Text:
For 
instance, EGNs rely on the generation of nucleophilic sites on a redoxactive molecule (e.g., 
quinone, Q) via reduction to initiate the selective capture of CO2 from its electrophilic carbon site. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024c25fk ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000344436239 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
