Description:
Plays a crucial role in the agricultural industry as a primary element for fertilizer production.

Text:
Ammonia plays a crucial role in the agricultural industry as a primary element for fertilizer 
production and it is also a foundational feedstock for pharmaceuticals, dyes, and chemical 
synthesis 1. Ammonia has also emerged as an energy carrier and transportation fuel. Ammonia consists of 17.6 wt  of hydrogen, and thereby, it can be used as an indirect 
hydrogen storage compound 2. Moreover, ammonias energy density is approximately 4.32 
kWh.L1, showing a capacity equivalently to methanol and almost double than that of liquid 
hydrogen 3. Recently, automobiles operating on pure ammonia and gasolineammonia fuel 
modifications are being hypothesized and near to be prototyped 4, 5.

Description:
A synthetic fuel that can be manufactured to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Text:
An important advantage 
of using pure ammonia is the resulting diminished reliance on fossil fuels by changing to a 
sustainable fuel source that can be manufactured synthetically 6. Soon synthetic low
carbon fuels will be needed as a response to the current environmental emergency, and 
ammonia is among such synthetic fuels.
