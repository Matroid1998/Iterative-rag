Description:
Can act as a counterion in aqueous electrolytes.

However, the influence of (H2O)6 clusters, which are prevalent within the defec
tive structure, has been debated, with some work concluding that these sites can inhibit ion insertion into the channels, while others 
deducing that K sits within the (H2O)6 cluster itself (Scheme 1b).15,21 The complications in understanding K ion location have resulted in 
ambiguity when assigning the chargebalancing species during framework redox processes, with suggestions that in aqueous electrolytes 
H3O or K can act as counterions.15,22,23 Indeed, similar uncertainty is also observed for other cations that can be incorporated into the 
structure, such as Mg2.24 
Another challenge in utilizing PB for energy storage applications is its varied stability over repeated cycling.
