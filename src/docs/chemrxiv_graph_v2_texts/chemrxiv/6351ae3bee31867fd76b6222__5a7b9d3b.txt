Description:
A dienophile used in the selective Diels-Alder cycloaddition with furanic compounds.

Text:
Several routes to biomassderived aromatics have been reported. Among those, one important 
pathway is the selective DielsAlder cycloaddition of furanic compounds, especially furan 
derivatives, with dienophiles such as bioethylene.5 High costs associated with the production of 
furan and its derivatives from biomass are currently the biggest drawback.6 Another fundamental 
route is the depolymerization of lignin by (catalytic) fast pyrolysis which yields a biooil, a 
complex mixture of oxygenated aromatic compounds.7 These require extensive purification, 
separation, and deoxygenation to obtain alkyl aromatics suitable for downstream processing. A 
more selective but less explored pathway is the selfcondensation of alkyl ketones. The CC
coupling reaction of alkanones via robust acidbasecatalyzed condensation is an efficient way to 
achieve deoxygenated aromatics from existing biorefinery streams, e.g., acetone from ABE
