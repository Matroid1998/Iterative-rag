Description:
Compounds with varying degrees of oxygenation and structural complexity that disrupt cellular membranes and induce cytotoxicity.

These amphiphilic compounds, consisting of aliphatic and alicyclic carboxylic acids 
50 
with varying degrees of oxygenation and structural complexity, disrupt cellular membranes 
51 
and induce cytotoxicity. At concentrations exceeding 0.10 mgL, NAFCs exhibit toxicity 
52 
toward aquatic organisms, and levels as high as 120 mgL have been observed in OSPW due 
53 
to their persistence 13. Consequently, developing efficient passive treatment methodologies 
54 
for OSPW remediation is of significant environmental and industrial importance. 55 
Buoyant photocatalysts (BPCs), comprised of glass microspheres functionalized with TiO, 
56 
offer a promising solardriven approach for the remediation of OSPW4,810. These 
57 
photocatalysts remain at the airwater interface, where solar illumination activates TiO2 and 
58 
generates reactive oxygen species capable of oxidizing NAFCs.
