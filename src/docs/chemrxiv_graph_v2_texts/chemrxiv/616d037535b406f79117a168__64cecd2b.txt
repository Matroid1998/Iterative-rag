Description:
Derived from a relatively low feed ratio of dicyclopentadiene and used in mixtures processed as liquids at elevated temperatures.

Text:
The reaction between sulfur and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) has been 
investigated for nearly half a century, providing a processible form of 
sulfur useful in the construction and composites industries.15 In 
these applications, the sulfur is primarily unreacted elemental sulfur 
dissolved or plasticised in a solution of low molecular weight 
polysulfides derived from a relatively low feed ratio of DCPD 
(typically 25 or less by mass).15 These mixtures can be processed 
as liquids at elevated temperatures (130140 C) and used as mortar 
for concrete buildings,2 sealants for tailings ponds,2 or reinforcement 
for plastic and glass fibres.3 Recently, we revisited copolymerisations 
of sulfur and DCPD,6 establishing how the feed ratio can be used to 
tune the thermal and mechanical properties of these polymers.6, 7 In 
these prior studies, sulfur was fully incorporated into the final, cured 
polymer, distinguishing these materials from the earlier sulfur 
plasticisation studies.
