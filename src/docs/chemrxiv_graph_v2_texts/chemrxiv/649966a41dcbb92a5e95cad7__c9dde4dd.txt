Description:
Used in vapor deposition techniques to form thin films of copper.

diagram of CuI. Upon the inclusion of
SOC, further splitting occurs on the
2 5MOs into light and heavy hole
channels and a spinorbit splitoff
band, as seen in (b). Figure 1. Crystal and electronic structure of CuI. In addition to its rather attractive electronic structure, the simplicity of CuI is another strong fac
tor in its revival in popularity. Good quality thin lms can be deposited via relatively straightforward
techniques such as vaporising iodine onto thin lms of copper ( la Bdeker), 35 solid and solution
