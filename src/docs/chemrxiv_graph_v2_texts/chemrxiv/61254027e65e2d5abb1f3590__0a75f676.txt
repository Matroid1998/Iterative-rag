Description:
Used as a precursor in the ALD of crystalline InN films.

Text:
We have previously hypothesized that steering the deposition chemistry fully to the surface 
could be an alternative route for low temperature CVD of InN as it could circumvent the 
problem of the slow kinetics in the gas phase decomposition of NH3. A CVD approach fully 
relying on surface chemistry is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which uses a sequential supply 
of the precursor gases to make the deposition chemistry surface controlled.20 ALD of 
crystalline InN films has been demonstrated using trimethyl indium (TMI) and either nitrogen 
plasma21,22 or NH3 plasma.23 In addition, complex precursors with chelating ligands with InN
