Description:
Used as a betadiketonate precursor in eCVD of copper.

The eCVD process can thus be regarded as a dry form of ECD with the 
potential to replace the wetchemical methods, allowing for integration in vacuum cluster 
tools. The eCVD has been demonstrated with iron, cobalt and nickel,4 but not yet for copper. In 
this study we explore eCVD of copper using the betadiketonate precursors Cu(hfac)2 and 
Cu(acac)2. Previous eCVD studies indicate that alternating the supply of the metal precursor 
and plasma electrons tends to yield higherquality films.6 By experimenting with pulse and 
purge times while studying the deposition in situ by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) 
sensor, we find conditions where the deposition chemistry seems to be selflimiting. We thus 
propose that we have demonstrated eALD of copper.
