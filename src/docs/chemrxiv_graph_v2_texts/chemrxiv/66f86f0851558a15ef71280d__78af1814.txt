Synthetic pumpkin-shaped macrocyclic molecules known for high affinity and selective binding interactions in medicinal chemistry and biomedical applications.

To address 
these challenges, the utilization of bioorthogonal chemistry to 
regulate selfimmolation presents a promising venue for precise 
control of cargo release.3639 
Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to highly specific chemical 
reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfer
ing with native biochemical processes and has been coupled 
with controlled release systems.40 Noncovalent chemistry is 
emerging as an alternative approach to covalency for forming 
unnatural complexes in living systems for applications such as 
cell labeling.41 Besides its potential for reversibility, noncova
lent chemistry benefits from not being dependent on second
order rate constants or highly activated reagents, which are ma
jor challenges present in developing bioorthogonal reactions.42 
Instead, the emphasis is on achieving high binding affinities 
(Ka).42 A group of synthetic pumpkinshaped macrocyclic mol
ecules known as cucurbitnurils (n  58, 10, 1315) have at
tracted increasing attention in medicinal chemistry and biomed
ical applications due to their high affinity4346 and highly selec
tive binding interactions which typically do not interfere with 
biological systems.4749 These characteristics have rendered cu
curbitmediated hostguest chemistry promising for a range of 
biological applications, such as proteins and biomolecule label
ing,5052 cellular and animal imaging,5357 modulating dynamic 
DNA chemistry,58,59 and protein aggregation,60,61 controlling 
bioorthogonal catalysis,62 and protein separation.63 
Of particular interests are cucurbitnurilmediated supramo
lecular drug delivery systems encapsulating physically en
trapped therapeutic agents.64 A popular strategy involves encap
sulating engineered small molecule drugs in the cucurbitnuril 
cavity through noncovalent hostguest interactions to down
regulate their bioactivity,65 while introducing a competitive 
guest molecule with a higher binding affinity enables the on
demand release of the caged therapeutic molecule and activa
tion of its therapeutic effects.6670 Moreover, cucurbitnuril
based chemistry has been innovatively used to construct self
assembling DNAsmall molecule chimeras,71 nanomateri
als,72,73 and hydrogel networks74 for the delivery of therapeutics.
