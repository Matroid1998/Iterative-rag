characteristics and are capable in the excited state of both accepting and donating an electron by 
interacting with adjacent donors or acceptors can act as centers for the absorption of light and 
photogeneration of electric charge carriers, in particular, in the photoconductive polymers 714. Among the organic dyes these requirements are met most fully by polymethine dyes 7, 9, 15
17. However, their photoelectric characteristics have been little studied. In the present work 
such characteristics of novel thin filmtype photoconductive polymeric composites (PPCs) based 
on an photoconductive naphthalimidecontaining copolymer and symmetrical cationic 
polymethine dyes (CPDs), depending on their key structural factor (the length of the 
polymethine chain), were investigated for the first time. 2.
