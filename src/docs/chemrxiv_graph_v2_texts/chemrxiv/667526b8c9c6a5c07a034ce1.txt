Paramagnetic complexes involving zinc are essentially unknown. A handful of 
related paramagnetic species have been described that contain TiHM or ZrHM (M  Al, Mg) 
groups.1319 The paramagnetic NiHFe core is also wellknown in hydrogenase enzymes.20

coordinated zinc hydride bond would be unique. Such species could lead to discovery of new types of 
reactivity and new directions in catalysis.
