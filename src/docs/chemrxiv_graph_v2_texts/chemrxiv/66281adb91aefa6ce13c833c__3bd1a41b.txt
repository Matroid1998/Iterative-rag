Description:
Has a higher decomposition temperature compared to thioacetamide and Lcysteine, releasing sulfur less readily.

For 2HMoS2, an irreversible transition to 1TMoS2 during the first electrochemical 
lithiation cycle at around 1.1 V vs. LiLi leads to an unfavorably low initial Coulombic 
efficiency17. The findings underline the significance of controlling MoS2 crystal structure, 
crystallite size, and morphology, to obtain desired functional properties. Not only electrochemical charge storage, but also the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution 
(HER) performance is dependent on MoS2 crystal structure and morphology18. This led to 
the exploration of various hydrothermal synthesis routes controlling MoS2 structure by choice 
of sulfurprecursor1922. Liu et al. found that thioacetamide (TAA) and Lcysteine (LC) 
possess lower decomposition temperatures than thiourea (TU), thereby releasing sulfur more 
readily, leading to smaller particle sizes and the tendency to form the 1Tpolytype, which in 
turn, leads to a favorable HER activity23.
