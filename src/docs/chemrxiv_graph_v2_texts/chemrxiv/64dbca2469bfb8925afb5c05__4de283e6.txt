Description:
A reagent that is violently reactive with water and used in sulfonation reactions.

One notable
example is Prontosil which was discovered to have the same active pharmacophore as
sulfanilamide.1 The breakthrough that valuable drugs could be synthesized from
seemingly tangential precursors in the early 1900s led to a proliferation of sulfa drugs
and revolutionized the age of chemotherapeutics.2, 3
Despite the simplicity of the structure of sulfanilamide, the reagents in the conventional
synthesis protocol are often acutely toxic and hazardous according to modern safety
standards. Namely, sulfonation requires the generation of SO2 gas in situ, which
necessitates a great deal of patience in allowing dissolved SO2 to react with the aniline
substrate along with the risk of extreme heat generation and toxic gas evolution. Sulfonation can be conveniently performed with chlorosulfonic acid, but the reagent is
violently reactive with water.
