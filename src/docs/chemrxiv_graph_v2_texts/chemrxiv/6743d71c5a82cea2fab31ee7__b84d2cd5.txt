In aquatic environments such as streams and rivers, contamination by trace metals 
39 
such as copper and zinc is a longstanding environmental issue (Luoma  Rainbow, 2008; 
40 
Namba et al., 2020). The risk assessment approaches for many individual metals, such as 
41 
copper, zinc, and nickel, have seen considerable advancements, particularly with the 
42 
development of biotic ligand models (Adams et al., 2020). However, predicting 
43 
ecological impacts of metal mixtures remains a challenging task (Farley et al., 2015), 
44 
although a general risk assessment framework has been proposed to address this issue 
45 
(Nys et al., 2018).
