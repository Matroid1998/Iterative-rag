Description:
Precursors for the synthesis of aryl azides via the diazonium salt.

Text:
Aryl azides 
are readily available from anilines, via the diazonium salt, and so this approach has become popular, especially 
when combined with a suitably protected alkyne (e.g. TMSCCH  C4C5 synthon) that can be conveniently 
removed when necessary. 4
