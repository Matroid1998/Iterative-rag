Description:
Compounds that can be hydrolyzed by OPH to reduce toxicity before entering the central nervous system.

Text:
A direct method that can hy
drolyze OP agents before they enter the central nervous system is needed. Currently, OPH is the only
enzyme used in organophosphate remediation (Cho et al. 2000), but more investigation is needed to
improve the use of OPH in medical therapy. The advantage of using OPH therapy over oximebased
treatment is rapid hydrolysis of OP agents in the circulatory system. Thus, nerve agents are eliminated
before penetrating the bloodbrain barrier and exerting eects in the nervous system. While the hydrolytic products of OP breakdown by OPH are generally of reduced toxicity relative
to their parent compounds (Cho et al. 2000, Kanugula et al. 2011), catalytic rates (kcat) and substrate
binding constants (KM) are inadequate for therapy.
