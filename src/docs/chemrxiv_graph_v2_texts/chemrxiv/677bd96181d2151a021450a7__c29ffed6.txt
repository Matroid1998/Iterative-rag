Description:
A ligand that confers stability in harsh environments.

Text:
530 mg19,20 and an average pore size of 67 2022, CALF20 (Zn) demonstrates a 
remarkable capacity and selective CO2 adsorption23 at desired conditions.21 Its unique framework, composed of 
1,2,4triazole and oxalate ligands confers stability in harsh environments.21 The necessity of capturing CO2 under 
fluctuating conditions is emphasized by the varying concentrations of CO2 found in diverse industrial emissions 
and atmospheric contexts. CALF20 (Zn) exhibits exceptional versatility in maintaining operational efficacy 
across a range of temperatures and pressures, positioning it as an indispensable tool in global efforts to mitigate
