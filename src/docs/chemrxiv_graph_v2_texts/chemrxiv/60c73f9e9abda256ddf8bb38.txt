Description:
An oxide ion conductor used in solid oxide fuel cells with high ionic conduction at 923 K.

Text:
Anionicconducting materials, especially oxide ion conductors, have been the focus of continued
research efforts over the past decades due to their potential use in renewable energy applications,
such as oxygenpermeable membranes and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).13 A crucial parameter
holding back their widespread implementation is the undesirably high temperature at which they
show sufciently high ionic conduction, which even for currently used, bestinclass materials
(such as yttriastabilised zirconia, YSZ) is 923 K.4 There is still very much a need to discover
and develop novel ionic conducting materials that operate at lower temperatures and to characterise
the connection between structure and conductivity in order to move towards rational design of
