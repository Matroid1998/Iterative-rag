Silymarin, an extract from fruits and seeds of the milk thistle Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn., 
69 
is basically a flavonolignan complex.1,2 Although its composition may vary depending on the 
70 
source, 70 is made up of the flavonolignans silybin A and B, isosilybin A and B, silychristin 
71 
A and B, silydianin and the flavanol taxifolin.

Description:
Undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation.

Text:
In vitro studies suggest that silymarin 
85 
may inhibit the proliferation of CD4 cells, affect the pathways of NFB activation10 or 
86 
inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokine.11 
87 
The bioavailability of silymarin components after oral administration is in the range 2050 
88 
due to low water solubility, extensive phase II metabolism, low permeability through intestinal 
89 
epithelial cells and involvement of efflux transporters.1214 The flavonoids and flavonolignans 
90 
undergo extensive enterohepatic circulation, with up to 80 of the absorbed silymarin 
91 
constituents reintroduced into the intestine via bile.12 In the large intestine, these compounds
