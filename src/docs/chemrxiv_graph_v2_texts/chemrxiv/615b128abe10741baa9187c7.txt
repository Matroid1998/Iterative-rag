Description:
Participates in a reversible reaction with NO to form the brown ring complex.

This inherent instabil
26
ity has hindered a detailed study of the brown ring test, though recent attempts have given
27
invaluable insights into the electronic structure and instability of the complex 4. Wanat
28
and coworkers have studied the kinetic and spectroscopic aspects of the reversible reaction
29
of NO with Fe(H2O)62 to give the brown ring complex 4. Their study also indicated
30
the presence of a S32 (quartet) species using EPR, which also also the presence of a
31
complex with an electronic structure resembling that of a FeNO7 species, following the
32
EnemarkFeltham notation 5. The superscript in FeNO7 denotes the combined number
33
of valence electrons in the Fe 3d and NO() orbitals.
