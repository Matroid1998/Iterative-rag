Description:
A hyperpolarized metabolite produced from the addition of paraenriched hydrogen to 113Cacetylene dicarboxylate.

Text:
However, the 
application of this powerful tool to in vivo metabolic 
studies is hampered by the limited number of metabolites 
that can be hyperpolarized by means of parahydrogen 
addition to an unsaturated precursor of the target 
molecule 1316. Hyperpolarized 113Cfumarate has 
Figure 1 Reaction scheme showing the chemical addition of 
paraenriched hydrogen to an unsaturated 113Cacetylene 
dicarboxylate precursor, to yield 113Cfumarate. The proton 
singlet order is then transformed into 13C magnetization by 
applying a constantadiabaticity magnetic field cycle 18, 
optimized for the 113Cfumarate Jcouplings. The field
cycling profile is shown in the inset.
