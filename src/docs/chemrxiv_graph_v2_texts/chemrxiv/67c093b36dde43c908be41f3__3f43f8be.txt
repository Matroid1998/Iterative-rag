Description:
A signaling molecule whose roles are studied using sulfide salts like Na2S or NaSH.

Text:
Hydrogen sulfide is a small gaseous signaling molecule, 
often labeled with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide in the 
group of signaling agents termed gasotransmitters.1 It 
plays a crucial role in many pathophysiological processes in 
mammalian tissues,24 including modulation of neurotrans
mission,5 vasodilation,6 and cytoprotection against reactive 
oxygen species (ROS).7 Simple sources of H2S, including sul
fide salts (Na2S or NaSH), are commonly used in biological 
studies on the roles of H2S.89 However, their unpredictable 
release rate that poorly mimics enzymatic reactions can 
lead to toxic and adverse effects.1011 To address these con
cerns, researchers have made significant advances in the 
development of small molecule donors that can be activated 
by hydrolysisesterases, endogenous oxidants, biological 
nucleophiles, and other specific biological conditions.1214 
Among these, caged thiocarbamates represent a novel class 
of H2S release molecules that can be activated by various 
specific biological stimuli to release carbonyl sulfide (COS), 
which is then quickly hydrolyzed to H2S by the ubiquitous 
carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme.1012 Following this strat
egy, some groups have expanded the toolbox to include do
nors activated by various triggers, such as selfimmola
tive,15 reactive oxygen species (ROS),16 glycine and cyste
ine,1718 click chemistry,19 esterase,20 and others2124 (Figure

Description:
Released from COSH2S donors activated by UV light or BODIPY-based photolabile donors with visible light activation.

Text:
A recentlydeveloped alternative approach to study reac
tive sulfur species (RSS) involves lighttriggered donors, as 
they have distinct advantages including high availability, 
modularity, and precise control over release in biochemical 
systems, while minimizing sideproduct formation.25 In 
2017, Pluth and coworkers reported the first COSH2S do
nors activated by UV light (  365 nm), leveraging the pho
tocleavage of the onitrobenzyl group (Figure 1b) to release 
COS and aniline.21 However, phototoxicity may occur due to 
prolonged UV light exposure which could limit the broad 
applicability of this material. To overcome this issue, 
BODIPYbased photolabile H2Sdonors with visible light ac
tivation were explored.
