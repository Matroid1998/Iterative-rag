While the abovereported materials represent wellestablished photocatalysts, in the last years 
metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have demonstrated to be efficient and promising materials for 
various photocatalytic applications thanks to their unique features such as tunable band gap, high 
absorption coefficient, and long charge carrier lifetime and diffusion lengths, which are crucial for 
reducing recombination rates and enhancing photocatalytic efficiency.2225 While MHPs have been 
extensively explored for several solarrelated applications, such as photocatalytic H2 generation, 
photoreduction of CO2, and synthesis of organic molecules, their exploitation in the field of nitrogen 
photofixation is in its newborn era, with the first example, reporting the Cs2AgBiCl6gC3N4 
heterojunction, recently published by our group, where it was proved that such system is capable, by 
properly tuning the heterojunction composition, to carry out both H2 photogeneration and N2 
photofixation with active sites for this reaction present on the carbon nitride and with the perovskite 
acting to improve charge carrier management.26 While this paper represents the first demonstration 
of a MHPsbased heterojunction for ammonia photoproduction, the obtained rates were relatively low 
and the full exploitation of the potential of such systems for nitrogen photofixation has still to be 
demonstrated.
