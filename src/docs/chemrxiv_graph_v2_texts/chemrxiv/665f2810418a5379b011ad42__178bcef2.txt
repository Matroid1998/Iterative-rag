Description:
An anode material incorporating silicon particles into a conjugated system.

Text:
Addressing these limitations, our research focuses on the development of a novel full cell 
system (Figure 1a) utilizing silicon coated by triazinebased graphdiyne (TzG) at the anode 
and SPAN at the cathode to overcome the traditional barriers associated with LiS batteries. The TzGSi anode benefits from the incorporation of silicon particles into a conjugated
