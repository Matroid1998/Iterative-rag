Description:
Used in metal recovery and catalysis of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in water splitting.

Text:
Examples include pollutant 
sensing30 or removal from water,3134 and catalysis in aqueous solutions.35 Certain applications 
require greater stability still, namely stability in acidic or basic aqueous solutions, such as metal 
(e.g., palladium) recovery36 and catalysis of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution 
reactions in water splitting.3740
