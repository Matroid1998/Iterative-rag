Description:
A solid material consisting of the fine-grained residues of biomass pyrolysis.

Text:
Here we consider this magnetic material in its 
role of catcher in the water, that is in the treatment of wastewater pollutants. Actually, the use of waste 
biomass to produce biochar useful to treat wastewater can be considered as a winwin approach (Xiao et al., 
2023) to the persistent problems regarding water pollution. 2. Biochar 
Biochar is a solid material which is consisting of the finegrained residues of biomass pyrolysis. It is the 
product of the thermochemical decomposition of biomass at moderate temperatures (350700C) under 
oxygenlimiting conditions (Brassard et al., 2019). Besides biochar, liquid (biooil) and gas (syngas) products 
are obtained from the thermal decomposition (Han  Kim, 2008, Ok et al., 2018, Bartoli et al., 2020).

Description:
Used as an amendment in agricultural soils due to its high carbon content, stability, porosity, and surface area.

Today, 
the main use of biochar is as amendment in agricultural soils, because of its high carbon content, stability, 
porosity and surface area (Brassard et al., 2019, Ok et al., 2015). Because of its relevantly functionalized 
surface, biochar is exhibiting compatibility with cement, asphalt, and polymer (Tan et al., 2021, Zhao et al.,
