Description:
Ligands studied for their role in NiI catalytic mechanisms.

Text:
Examples 
of such investigations have examined several ligand classes 
on NiI centers Matsubara12 and Schoenebeck13 have studied 
Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, Hazari9,1416 and 
Schoenebeck17 bisphosphine ligands, and Hazari18,19 and 
Martin19,20 phenanthroline ligands. For each ligand class, 
tractable conclusions about the role(s) of NiI species in the 
respective catalytic mechanisms have been put forth. How
ever, existing strategies for synthesizing NiI species (Figure 
1A) limit the breadth of complexes that can be accessed 
with catalytically relevant ligands.
