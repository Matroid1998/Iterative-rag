Description:
A material analogous to porphene but composed of fused benzene rings.

Text:
Recently, the twodimensional fully conjugated polymer porphene (1), analogous to
graphene but composed of fused porphyrin instead of fused benzene rings, was synthesized by a
singlestep oxidative polymerization of the Zn salt of parent porphyrin 2 (also known as
porphine) on the surface of water, with K2IrCl6 as the oxidant.1 The initially formed freebase 1
strongly doped with electron holes was reduced with NaI and subsequently converted to its zinc
salt Zn1 and other metal salts of 1 by reaction with solutions of metal chlorides. The potentially
very large family of metalloporphenes M1, possibly carrying a variety of axial substituents,
remains to be explored.
