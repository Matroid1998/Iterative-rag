Description:
Involved in dinuclear copper(II) complexes studied for hydrogen bonding effects.

On one hand, it helps to 
stabilize the dioxygen (O2) binding to irondependent pro
teins like hemoglobin and myoglobin.1 On the other hand, it 
helps to drive the reactivity in O2 utilizing enzymes like ox
idases and oxygenases.2 However, the exact molecular de
tails of hydrogenbonding assistance are difficult to study 
due to the complex dynamic behavior of the hydrogen 
bonds in the enzymes.3 
An elegant example for investigating the effect of the hy
drogen bonding on the metaldioxygen stabilization was re
ported previously by the group of Masuda.4 In their re
search, they studied the effect of the hydrogen bonding on 
peroxo dinuclear copper(II) complexes.
