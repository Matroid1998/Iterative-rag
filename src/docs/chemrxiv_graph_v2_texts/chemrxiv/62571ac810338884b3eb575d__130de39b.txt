Green hydrogen economy 
Despite decades of research towards alternatives, fossil fuels account for more than 80 of global energy 
consumption today.1 Facing dwindling natural resources and burgeoning ecological consequences, we are 
challenged with charting a sustainable course for modern life using renewable energy sources. This will 
require safe and reliable methods of converting, storing, and using energy that can compete with 
hydrocarbon fuels extracted from the Earth. While the optimal solutions may vary depending on 
geographical location and availability of alternative energyenabling materials, one major proposed 
avenue is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier and hydrogen fuel cells as a primary method of 
converting energy into electricity.
