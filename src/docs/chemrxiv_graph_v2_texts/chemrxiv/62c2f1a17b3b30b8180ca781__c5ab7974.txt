Molecular wheels attract continued attention, partly due to beautiful structural aesthetics, but also 
because some show fascinating and potentially useful physical properties.1 In the field of molecular 
magnetism, molecular wheels of 3d transition metals came into prominence in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s with the publication of CrIII8 and FeIII10.2 The former has inspired the development of a 
large family of homo and heterometallic Cr wheels including the first examples of oddnumbered 
wheels that display topological frustration, with potential as quantum bits in information processing.3 
The latter, and other antiferromagnetically coupled evenmembered wheels, are characterised by a 
diamagnetic spin ground state and display interesting quantum phenomena and spin dynamics, 
including tunneling of the Nel vector,4 spinmultiplet mixing effects5 and magnetic level repulsions.6 
The intervening years have witnessed the publication of wheels of all the 3d metals with nuclearities 
up to eighty four.7 In CoII chemistry8 early examples of wheels included a dodecanuclear cluster built 
with a substituted pyridone9 and an heptanuclear Anderson wheel stabilised by tripodal alcohols,10 
both display ferromagnetic exchange interactions.
