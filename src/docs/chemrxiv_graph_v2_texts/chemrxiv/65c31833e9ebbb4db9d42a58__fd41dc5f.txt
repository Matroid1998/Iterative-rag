Description:
A type of plastic comparable to biodegradable plastics formed from vanillin.

Text:
Lignin is a heavily branched and complex molecule that can be degraded using the Nitrobenzene
Oxidation (NBO) Method, eventually giving rise to Vanillin Figure 1. Vanillin is the key
component responsible for forming Biodegradable plastics, comparable to polyethylene
terephthalate (PET). Vanillin can be acetylated using Sodium Acetate and Acetic Anhydride to
form acetyl ferulic acid, which can be polymerised using Zinc Acetate Zn(OAc)2 and processed
further to form Bioplastics. Figure 1 Reaction Scheme to form Vanillin from Lignin
