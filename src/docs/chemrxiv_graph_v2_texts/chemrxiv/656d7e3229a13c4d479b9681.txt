This demonstrates, if proof was

and biobased chemistry concepts, which aims to add value to 
biomasses, mainly agricultural, algal or forestry, without 
competing with food resources. Therefore, while biodiversity 
hotspots have historically attracted the most significant re
search interest, the chemical profiling of dedicated biomasses 
or coproducts from existing industries has become an essen
tial challenge for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 via the 
circular economy concept.
