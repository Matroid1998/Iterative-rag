Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted by aviation that contributes to radiative forcing.

Text:
The impact of soot on climate change 
is particularly pronounced in aviation not only is the 
radiative forcing (RF) from aviationgenerated 
black carbon almost onethird that of aviation
emitted CO2 (9.5 vs. 35 mWm2 12, 13), but soot 
particles are the primary nucleation source for 
aviationinduced cirrus (AIC), which has the largest 
RF due to aviation (50 mWm2 12). Experiments 
with aircraft flying in tandem have demonstrated 
that contrail formation from the lead plane is 
reduced if it is burning sustainable aviation fuels 
(SAFs) with low aromatics content 14.
