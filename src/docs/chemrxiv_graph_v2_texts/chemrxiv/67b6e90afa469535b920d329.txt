Description:
Additives ensuring good electrical conductivity in lithium-ion battery electrodes.

Energy storage technologies, such as LithiumIon Batteries (LIBs), play a major role in the 
ongoing global energy transition. LIBs play a very important role in our societies, as illustrated by 
the wide variety of their successful applications, from portable electronics to transportation 1 
LIB cells are made of two porous electrodes supported on current collectors, and a porous 
separator. The electrodes are composites made of Active Material (AM) ensuring lithiation and 
delithiation electrochemical reactions, carbon additives ensuring good electrical conductivity, and 
polymeric binders ensuring mechanical integrity. The pores within the electrodes and the 
separators are filled with liquid electrolyte in order to ensure lithiumion exchange between the 
electrodes upon the electrochemical cycling of the LIB cells.
