Description:
A chromophore commonly found in proteins that harvests light energy in natural systems.

Previous studies revealed the possibility 
of generating photocurrents using the PS protein111 and of utilizing the protein in photovoltaic 
devices12,13 and solar cells.1417 The use of the PS protein in such devices requires a deposition 
process of the PS, resulting in a monolayer or a multilayer film, and thus, it has to be formed on a 
surface, such as an electrode or gold nanoparticle.1 Furthermore, in most studies the photocurrent 
generation was achieved in an electrochemical setup, i.e., in an aqueous solution, which can be a 
limiting factor. In natural systems, the light energy is harvested by a myriad of chromophores 
situated within proteins, one of the most common ones of which is the chlorophyll (Chl) 
chromophore.
