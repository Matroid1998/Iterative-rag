Description:
An oxygenate with lower volatility, lower hydroscopicity, and higher energy density than ethanol, providing similar knock resistance.

Text:
In June 2018, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency ap
proved the large scale blending of bioderived isobutanol into
gasoline at concentrations up to 16.1,2 This newly approved
oxygenate has multiple advantages over ethanol, such as lower
volatility,3 lower hydroscopicity,4 and higher energy density,3
while providing similar knock resistance.5 Relative to larger
alcohol additives, isobutanol also shows longer ignition delay
times with lower CO and NOx emissions,6 indicating it could
help boost the octane numbers of fuel while lowering other
emissions. With this approval, isobutanol could become a
major component of transportation fuel in the United States. While extensive experimental testing was necessary prior to
the approval,4 detailed isobutanol combustion models are still
inaccurate at enginerelevant conditions, indicating a gap in
our understanding of isobutanol combustion.

Description:
Involves peroxy radical chemistry important in combustion regimes.

Text:
Detailed isobu
tanol mechanisms typically deviate more from experiments
than do models of nbutanol, tertbutanol and secbutanol.7,8
Multiple intermodel comparisons using detailed isobutanol
models have showed that at lean, lowtemperature conditions
the models yield a wide range of ignition timings that devi
ate from experimental ignition delay measurements in homo
geneous charge compression9 and shock tube setups.10 One
mechanism shows the largest deviations from experiments be
low 850 K and at fuel lean conditions, indicating that the
dependence on O2 might be incorrectly described.11
Such shortcomings of isobutanol combustion indicate a
need for an improved understanding of isobutanol combus
tion in combustion regimes in which peroxy radical chemistry
is often important.12 The dominant degradation pathway of
peroxy radicals at various temperatures and pressures impacts
overall ignition properties such as the negative temperature
coecient region, in which ignition slows with increasing tem

perature. While several aspects of isobutanol combustion chemistry
have been studied in detail, such as the initial hydrogen ab
straction by OH13 and the oxidation of its smaller oxidation
products,14 accurate pressuredependent kinetics of peroxy
radicals formed in isobutanol combustion has not been fully
developed nor incorporated into detailed models. This is in
spite of some isobutanol studies showing that ignition delay
is sensitive to peroxy radical reactions.8,10 Given the sensi
tivity of this fuel to equivalence ratio and pressure,5 the for
mation and fate of peroxy radicals can signicantly impact
ignition timing and multistage heat release.12,15 Peroxy rad
ical chemistry is also expected to control the environmental
fate of isobutanol emitted into the environment, since peroxy
radicals are also key intermediates in atmospheric degradation
processes.

Description:
Undergoes hydrogen abstraction leading to the formation of peroxy radicals.

Text:
Figure 1 shows the peroxy radicals studied in this work,
which correspond to the three most predominant hydrogen
abstractions that isobutanol can undergo. The alkoxy radical
formed from hydrogen abstraction of isobutanol by OH is ex
pected to be much less common13 and is not included in this
work. For each of the three isomers studied, various unimolec
ular reactions can occur, as shown in Figure 2. The peroxy
radicals (RO2) can isomerize through intramolecular hydro
