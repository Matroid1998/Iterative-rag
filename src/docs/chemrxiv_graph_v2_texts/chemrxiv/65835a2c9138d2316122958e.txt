Description:
Robust surface chemistry used for tuning glycan density and valency on gold nanoparticles.

In particular, gold nanoparticles, GNPs, are 
wellsuited for constructing polyvalent glycoconjugates, owing to their advantageous properties, such 
as low nontoxicity,18 widely available size and shape range, and robust goldthiol surface chemistry 
for easy tuning of the glycan density and valency.19 Notably, their large surfaceareatovolume ratio 
is also advantageous in forming stable, well presented threedimensional displays of target glycans.12, 
17 Furthermore, glycanfunctionalised GNPs (glycanGNPs) have excellent colloidal stability, 
biocompatibility, and high resistance against nonspecific interactions, these make them wellsuited 
for a wide range of biological and biomedical applications.9, 20 
Meanwhile, pH is a vitally important environmental stimulus for many biological processes and 
functions. It also plays a key role in viral infections.
