Description:
A catalyst used in oxidation reactions, though less effective than gold in resisting oxygen deactivation.

The selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding 
aldehydes and ketones is a pervasive process within the realm of 
synthetic organic chemistry.14 This reaction remains a focal 
point of extensive investigation, driven in part by the prevalence 
of these components in pharmaceuticals, vitamins, and 
fragrances.1,58 The use of stoichiometric amounts of oxidants 
often leads to uncontrolled overoxidation, resulting in the 
formation of the unwanted carboxylic acid13,5 accompanied by 
the generation of toxic or environmentally harmful waste. To 
counteract this, alternatives based on homogeneous and 
heterogeneous catalysis are being researched.9,10 Gold catalysts 
demonstrate superior performance over Pd, Pt, and Ru, showing 
enhanced resistance to oxygen deactivation and higher selectivity 
for the oxidation of primary over secondary alcohols.11,12,13.
