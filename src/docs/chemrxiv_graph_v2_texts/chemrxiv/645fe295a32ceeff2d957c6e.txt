Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to impact a number of nextgeneration 
technologies owing to their extraordinary electrical, thermal and chemical properties.1,2 The key 
to achieving their promise lies in maximizing their yield during synthesis, while at the same time 
tailoring their structural properties for their intended application.3 A number of approaches have 
been employed for increasing CNT yield, including the addition of growth promoters,411 feedstock 
compositional control,1214 and improved catalyst design.15,16 Among all of the synthesis process 
variables, the growth temperature has arguably the greatest effect on growth behavior; an 
increase in the growth temperature enhances yield but also results in other issues such as 
amorphous carbon deposition (sooting), increasing tube diameters and excessive catalyst particle 
coarsening (Ostwald ripening and coalescence).1719 The temperature is typically treated as a 
static variable, where a substrate coated with a metal catalyst film is heated in a hot or coldwall 
furnace up to a predetermined value, followed by a hold time at that temperature while the catalyst 
is exposed to the hydrocarbon feedstock.
