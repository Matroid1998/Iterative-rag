Used in the analysis of aluminum corrosion through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

However, to the best of the 
authors knowledge, the current trend particularly in mechanistic analysis leans towards the 
Nyquist plot, attributed to its straightforward distinctive semicircle visualization.1, 13, 14 Taking 
analyzing aluminum corrosion in concentrated KOH as an example, a series of electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data was obtained across various potentials and visualized by 
Nyquist plot, and the interpretation involves identifying the electrochemical process that best 
aligns with the loci of experimental impedance spectra, utilizing a set of optimized model 
parameters.15 Determining the superior data representation in EIS remains an open question, given 
the diverse features of various formats, and the challenge of statistically evaluating the impact of 
data representation on manual EIS interpretation further complicates this inquiry.
