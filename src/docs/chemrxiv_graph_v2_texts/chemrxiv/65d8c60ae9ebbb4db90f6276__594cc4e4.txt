Description:
A component of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons, forming fused ring structures.

Text:
Polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) are poly
cyclic aromatic systems (PASs) that contain
only fused benzene rings. PBHs can be con
sidered as cutouts from a graphene sheet and
can be further divided into catacondensed and
pericondensed PBHs (ccPBHs and pcPBHs,
respectively; see Figure 1). The difference lies
in the way the benzene rings are fused to one
another. While in ccPBHs, any carbon atom
can be shared by at most two adjacent rings,
in pcPBHs, a single carbon can be shared by
up to three rings, which leads to the forma
tion of 2D structures.

Description:
The prototypical aromatic system used as a model for studying aromaticity and reactivity.

Text:
Because they con
tain only benzenethe prototypical aromatic
systemPBHs are sometimes considered the
prototypical PASs and serve as model systems
for investigating chemical concepts such as aro
maticity1 and reactivity.2 In addition to their
importance for fundamental studies, PBHs are
pervasive in both the natural and manmade en
vironments, and play key roles in multiple areas
of research, including the formation of stars,36
human health,7 environmental impact,8 and
more recentlyas promising materials for or
ganic electronics.9 PASs in general, and PBHs
in particular, have been used for a variety of
electronic and optoelectronic technologies, in
cluding field effect transistors,1014 solar cells,15
chemical sensors,16 anode and cathode materi
als,1721 and anolytes22 for redoxflow batteries. 1
