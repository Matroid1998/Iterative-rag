Description:
The nature of which affects the effectiveness of organic removal methods from zeolites.

Text:
In the case of zeolite membranes,
calcination may introduce cracks that compromise their separation performance and mechanical
properties.1 Thus, there is a significant interest in developing routes for the removal of organics
from zeolites through milder treatments.2 The effectiveness of such methods depends on the pore
system and on the nature of the OSDA.
