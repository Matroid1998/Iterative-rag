Description:
A solid-state electrolyte known for its conductivity.

Further disad
vantages are formation of potentially rate limiting solid
electrolyte interphases, simultaneous anion diusion8,
lower operating voltages9, and dendrite formation caus
ing incompatibility with Limetal anodes with 10
the capacity of current graphitic anodes10).11 The use of
a solidstate electrolyte (SSE) is therefore desirable as it
xes many of these problems simultaneously. Current solid electrolyte materials include e.g. the
Lirich garnets such as Li7La3Zr2O12
(LLZO)1214,
the
Argyrodites
Li6MS5X
(MS,Se,XCl,Br,I)1517,
Li10GeP2S12
(LGPS)1820,
as

as

(LiPON)21,22. Unfortunately, these materials possess
a tradeobetween stability and conductivity.
