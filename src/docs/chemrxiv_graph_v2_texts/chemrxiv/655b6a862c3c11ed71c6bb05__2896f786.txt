Description:
The fluorophore used for tumor visualization.

Text:
After accumulating in the brain tumor, 5ALA is enzymatically transformed into Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) 
(12), which is the fluorophore used for tumor visualization. The brain tumor surgery is followed by 
radiochemotherapy to reduce residual tissue and thus improve the overall tumor removal (13, 14). However, these therapies do not selectively affect cancerous tissue and result in collateral damage of 
healthy, surrounding brain cells. A recent therapeutic approach, with the goal of establishing a tumor specific therapeutic alternative to 
chemo or radiotherapy, focuses on enhancing the functionality of the already administered fluorescent 
dye used for tumor visualization to additionally act as a photosensitizing agent in photodynamic therapy 
(PDT) (15).
