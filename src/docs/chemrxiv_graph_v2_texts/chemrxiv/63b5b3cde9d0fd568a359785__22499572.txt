Description:
Introduction of nitrogens into the conjugated system lowers the HOMO energy level without influencing the planarity of the molecule.

However, it 
was found that benzodithiophenes undergo photo
oxidative degradation at the 4 and 8position.9 As 
it is known for acenes, in particular pentacene, in
troduction of nitrogens into the conjugated sys
tem lower the HOMO energy level without influen
cing the planarity of the molecule.1014 Consequ
ently, Nheteroacenes are more airstable and 
possess higher electron transport efficiency.10,15,

In this respect, Hayashi et al. could show by 
quantum chemical calculations that the introduc
tion of nitrogen(s) in syn and antibenzodithiophe
ne 1 and 2, represented in dithienopyridines 3 and 
4 and in syn and antidithienopyrazine 5 and 6 
leads to a continuous decrease of both, the HOMO
