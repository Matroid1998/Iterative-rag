Description:
Porous materials used as sorbents in adsorption-based processes for CO2 capture.

In contrast, adsorptionbased
processes for the capture and separation of CO2 using porous sorbents have been
proposed as a promising energy and costefficient alternative. Pressurevacuum and
temperatureswing (PSVA, and TSA) adsorption have been explored at both lab and
pilot scales to successfully drive the capture and regeneration of CO2 in sorbents such as
zeolites 69, porous carbons 3, 10, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) porous
coordination polymers (PCPs) 1113. Although the running costs of such processes
using porous sorbents offer significant benefits as compared to CO2 capture using amine
compounds, problems with these techniques still exist and are related to e.g. large energy
consumptions for CO2 capture in feed gas mixtures containing low concentrations of CO2
(i.e.
