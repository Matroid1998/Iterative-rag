Description:
Induces a substantial steric impact, affecting the conjugation of the NAH framework.

Text:
of the methyl group induces 
a substantial steric impact, evident from the alterations in the conjugation of the NAH 
framework as analyzed by theoretical studies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
data. Among the series, the compound with two methyl groups is the most anomalous. Despite having two methyl groups, this compound exhibits greater polarity than the 
compound with a single methyl group on the amide nitrogen, as determined by thinlayer 
chromatography. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical 
properties of alkylated NAH derivatives and can guide their application in various 
branches of chemistry and medicinal chemistry. Introduction
