Description:
Analyzed using Raman spectra with temperature variation.

Text:
A detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of SiCN deposited 
with a temperature variation as well as of carbon nitride with nitrogen flow rate has been published 
previously 1, 2, 3 
A flow rate of 5 sccm was maintained for C2H2 while flow of nitrogen was varied as 5, 15, 30 and 60 sccm. The deposition chamber was pumped down to 105 mbar by turbo molecular pump prior to inletting the 
precursor gases. The chemical composition of the deposited films was done by EDS. The concentration 
of nitrogen in film increased with the increase in nitrogen flow and reached nearly 15 at at a nitrogen 
flow rate of 60 sccm. Increase of nitrogen percentage in the films leads to increase in clustering of sp2 
carbon.
