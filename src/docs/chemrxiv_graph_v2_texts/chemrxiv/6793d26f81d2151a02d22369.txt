Description:
Involved in the stretching of backbone amides in the Amide I mode.

Text:
For instance, the Amide I mode (mainly CO stretch
ing of backbone amides)49 can be used to distinguish between
parallel and antiparallel sheet structures5054 and quantita
tively assess the strength of hydrogen bonding interactions
between strands.49,5558 The Amide III mode, which derives
from amide CN stretching and NH bending,49 can be used to
measure the distribution of Ramachandran angles adopted
by peptide bonds in fibrils.40,42,5965 Thus, these and other vi
brational bands enable the facile differentiation of structural
features and interactions between different fibril polymorphs. In contrast to the fingerprint region, the lowfrequency re
gion ( 500cm1) of vibrational spectra has been less ex
plored for probing the structural characteristics of amyloid fib
ril polymorphs.
