Description:
A reactive species involved in transfer catalysis to CH bonds and olefinic substrates.

Text:
Since Breslows seminal discovery of Mn porphyrincatalyzed amination of cyclohexane, Mn 
tetrapyrroles have emerged as an important platform for nitrene transfer catalysis.1 The 
combination of nitrene precursors, such as iminoiodinanes1c, 2 or Nhaloamides,3 and Mn(III) 
porphyrin catalysts enables nitrene transfer to CH bonds and olefinic substrates to afford amines 
and aziridines, respectively (Figure 1). Enantioselective nitrene transfer catalysis has been realized 
using D4symmetric chiral Mn porphyrin catalysts.2c, 4 More recently, White et al. have developed 
related Mn(III) phthalocyanines as highly active catalysts for aliphatic CH amination.5 In 
analogy to metalloporphyrinsupported metal oxo intermediates in CH hydroxylation catalysis, 
the developed nitrene transfer catalysis is proposed to proceed via the intermediacy of reactive 
highvalent Mn nitrenoids.6

Description:
A reactive intermediate involved in nitrene transfer reactions.

Text:
Mn tetrapyrrolecatalyzed nitrene transfer catalysis has been applied to both CH amination and olefin 
aziridination reactions. Electrophilic Mn nitrenoids are proposed to mediate this family of nitrene transfer reactions. The reactivity of the Mn nitrenoids that are invoked as transient intermediates in nitrene 
transfer catalysis renders these species challenging to observe.7 Stabilization of these 
intermediates via synthetic modification of the ancillary ligand set can attenuate the reactivity of 
the supported Mn nitrenoid and enable isolation.
