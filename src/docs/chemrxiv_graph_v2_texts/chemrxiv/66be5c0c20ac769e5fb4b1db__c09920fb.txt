Description:
Forms intermolecular CHF interactions when partially substituting CPPs.

Text:
In the whole family of the 
CPPs, only one member, 6CPP, has been reported to crystallize 
in a porous tubular arrangement.12 In this case, the tubular 
stacks can be reinforced by intermolecular interactions; for 
example, CPPs form nanotubelike arrays after partial 
substitution with fluorine, due to intermolecular CHF 
interactions.13 This type of packing can be utilized as a confined 
space to form hostguest composites.14 
Based on the sixfold symmetry of the porphyrin nanoring c
P6T6 (Fig. 1a), it might be expected to form hexagonal arrays, 
resulting in tubular stacks and infinite 2D sheets due to the 
stacking between the planar walls oriented perpendicularly to 
the macrocycle.
