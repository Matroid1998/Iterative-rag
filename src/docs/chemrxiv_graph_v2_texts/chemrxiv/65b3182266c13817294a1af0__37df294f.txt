Description:
Centers that reversibly form and split H2.

Text:
Enzymes often use two or more metal sites to catalyze difficult oxidative, reductive, and redoxneutral 
transformations. For example, nature uses diiron and dicopper sites to activate O2 and oxygenate substrates,1,2 
as well as diiron and NiFe centers to reversibly form and split H2.3,4 Two metal cations can also work jointly 
to increase the electrophilicity and nucleophilicity of reaction partners, such as in the hydrolysis of phosphate 
ester and amide bonds.5,6 We have been interested in translating these bioinspired concepts to a heterogeneous 
platform, to leverage the greater stability, 
recyclability, and unique microenvironments 
found in porous materials. An ideal heterogeneous scaffold would, like 
enzymes, offer precise control over the active site 
nuclearity and metalmetal distance, as well as the 
identity and flexibility of the primary coordination 
sphere.
