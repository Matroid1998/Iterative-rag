Description:
An iron complex activated via UV irradiation to promote nitrile reduction with HBpin.

Text:
The first example of iron
catalyzed nitrile hydroboration was reported by Nakazawa 
using a cooperative ironindium heterobimetallic system, 
1a.23 Findlater and coworkers reported an iron complex 
bearing the redox active bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN) 
ligand for nitrile hydroboration without the use of an exog
enous activator, 1b.24 Recently, Hashimoto and coworkers 
reported the use of an iron silylNHC complex 1c with acti
vation via UV irradiation ( 300 nm) to promote nitrile re
duction with HBpin.25 There has been even less develop
ment in iron catalysis for the functionalization of Nhet
eroarenes, in 2017 Tung and Wang reported a N2bridged 
diiron complex, 1d, and showed it to catalyze the selective 
1,2hydroboration of Nheteroarenes.26 Liang and Song also 
utilized a piano stool iron(II) complex, 1e, for the 1,4
