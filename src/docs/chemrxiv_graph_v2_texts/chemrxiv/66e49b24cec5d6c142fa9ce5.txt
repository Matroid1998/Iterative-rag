Description:
Centered within heme, contributing to the quenching of Hb fluorescence.

Text:
As 
110 
Hb fluorescence is quenched due to the iron centered within heme 2,28, fluorimetry could 
111 
provide insight into the ex vivo degradation of blood biomolecules other than Hb. Previous 
112 
bloodstain TSD studies using fluorimetry reported that whole blood contained three prominent 
113 
endogenous fluorophores tryptophan (Trp), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and 
114 
flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 2932. Weber et al. 30 and Wjtowicz et al. 29 collected 
115 
steadystate measurements (i.e., excitation and emission spectra) of peripheral blood and menstrual 
116 
blood, respectively, within the first 24 hours following deposition. Both noted a timedependent 
117 
decrease in the fluorescence corresponding to Trp and an increase in the fluorescence 
118 
corresponding to NADH and flavins 29,30.
