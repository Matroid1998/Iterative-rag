Description:
Derivatives can be oxidized to secoCPI analogues, which undergo spontaneous cyclisation.

Text:
In our efforts to generate biooxidatively activated prodrugs of 
the duocarmycins, we have previously shown that Cytochrome 
P450 
(CYP) 
enzymes 
can 
oxidise 
dehydroxylated 
chloromethylindoline derivatives such as 6 to their secoCPI 
analogues, which undergo spontaneous cyclisation and 
subsequent sequence selective DNA alkylation (Scheme 1).9, 21
