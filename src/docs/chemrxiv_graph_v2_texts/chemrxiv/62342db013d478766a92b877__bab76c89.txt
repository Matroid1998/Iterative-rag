Small particles created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.

Despite the increasing use of clean energies in the energy supply system, traditional fossil 
fuels will continue to play a dominant role in the foreseeable future. This is particularly true in 
the transportation, where internal combustion engines use 70 of the nearly 90 million barrels 
of crude oil consumed worldwide each day. However, the burning of fossil fuels contributes 
significantly to the greenhouse effect and the climate change, in addition to the formation of 
various harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and soot. Soot is made of small carbon 
particles created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (1, 2).

Description:
A fuel that undergoes pyrolysis in the formation of soot particles.

Text:
The generation of soot 
particles is believed to undergo four steps, including the pyrolysis of carbon fuel, PAH growth, 
soot nucleation, soot growth and oxidation (7, 8). However, detailed chemical mechanism of 
PAH growth has not yet been well established and specific reaction paths leading to the PAH 
growth remain elusive. Furthermore, definite chemical mechanisms leading to the inception of 
soot from the growth of PAH is probably the least known part of soot formation process, and is 
highly debated (8, 9). In recent years, many efforts have been made to investigate the formation of the soot both 
by experiment and theory.
