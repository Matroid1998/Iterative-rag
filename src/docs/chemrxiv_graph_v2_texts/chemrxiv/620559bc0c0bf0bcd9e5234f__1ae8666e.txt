Description:
Metallic lithium anodes have a high theoretical capacity (3861 mAh/g) and the lowest negative electrochemical potential (3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode).

The most 
prominent representatives are Lithiumion batteries (LIBs)15, which are facing controversy 
due to the use of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, or graphite.6 Metallic 
lithium anodes have a high theoretical capacity (3861 mAhg1), the lowest negative 
electrochemical potential (3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), and a low density 
(0.59 gcm3), however, are prone to form dendrites.7 Dendrites are needleshaped structures 
leading to short circuits, thermal runaways, and even battery failures, although promising 
approaches such as the electrostatic shielding of the lithium surface through additives have 
been proposed to tackle this problem.8 Due to these safety concerns, graphite with 
intercalated lithium ions is still used as anode material in commercial LIBs, reducing its 
theoretical capacity by roughly one order of magnitude to 372 mAhg1 in present day 
commercial LIBs.9 
Therefore, rechargeable multivalent magnesiumion batteries (MIBs) have emerged as a 
promising alternative, mainly due to the bivalency of the magnesium atom, which allows it to 
carry twice the charge resulting in a higher volumetric capacity (3833 mAhcm3 vs. 777 
mAhcm3 of graphite anodes in commercial LIBs).10 Additionally, magnesium has a low 
electrochemical potential (2.37 V vs. SHE), is highly abundant, of low cost, and is 
environmentally friendly.
