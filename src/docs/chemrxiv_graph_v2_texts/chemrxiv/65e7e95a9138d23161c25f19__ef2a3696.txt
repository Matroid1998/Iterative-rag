Earlier intermittent research on such carbon molecules provided only evidence of 
their existence in the gas phase.912 In 2019, the successful generation and clear 
imaging of cyclo18carbon (C18) in condensed phase quickly sparked a research 
boom on cyclocarbons.13 Subsequently, in the past four years, due to its attractive 
aesthetic structure and potential application prospects, a large number of property 
predictions and synthesis attempts for C18 and its analogues were emerged.1447 
Thereinto, our group has conducted extensive and indepth theoretical research on C18 
ring and related systems, and achieved significant results.2944 Very recently, three 
smaller carbon rings, i.e., cyclo16carbon (C16),46 cyclo14carbon (C14),47 and 
cyclo10carbon (C10),47 have also been prepared and characterized in the condensed 
phase, which is bound to trigger another wave of research enthusiasm for 
cyclocarbons.
