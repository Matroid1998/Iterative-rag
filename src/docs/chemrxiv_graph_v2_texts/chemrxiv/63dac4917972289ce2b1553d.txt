Description:
Quantum dots capable of driving carbon-carbon coupling reactions.

Text:
In 2017, the Weiss and Weix groups demonstrated 
that cadmium chalcogenide QDs were capable of driving carboncarbon coupling reactions.3,4 
Since then, QDs have also been shown to catalyse alcohol oxidation,5 dehalogenation,6 lignin 
depolymerisation,7,8 nitro reduction,9 transfer hydrogenation,10 and various polymerisation 
reactions.11 There have also been examples using more environmentally benign and lower energy
absorbing InPZnS12 and CuInS2 as photocatalysts.13 There is much motivation to continue 
developing such catalysts as chemical manufacturing now accounts for 10 of total global energy 
consumption and 7 of greenhouse emissions.14 
In order to extract charge carriers from photocatalysts, charge transfer must outcompete 
native radiative and nonradiative recombination pathways.15 To this end, QDs can be engineered 
such that there is minimal overlap of electron and hole wavefunctions, thereby extending the 
excited state lifetime and preventing recombination.
