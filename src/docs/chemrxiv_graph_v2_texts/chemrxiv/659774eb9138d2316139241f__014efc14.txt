Description:
Conversion is influenced by the structure of the support and catalyst, affecting the active catalytic surface area and flow dynamics.

Text:
Particles are generally deposited 
onto the support by capillary solvent adsorption or vapor deposition techniques.1922 The 
structure of the support and catalyst has been shown to influence the overall CO2 conversion by 
affecting the true active catalytic surface area, the flow dynamics of reactant gases, and the 
electric field inside the discharge region.9,2325 
While the use of chemically synthesized, particulate catalysts may allow for convenient control 
during synthesis, the heterogeneity of the distribution can have significant effects on the process. It is difficult to separate catalytic effects from those derived from mass transport or interactions 
with the plasma in the reactor.
