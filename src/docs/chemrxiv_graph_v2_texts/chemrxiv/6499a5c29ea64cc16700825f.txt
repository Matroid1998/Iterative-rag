Description:
A single crystal layered material used as a cathode active material in Li-ion batteries.

Text:
One strategy to improve
the stability of Liion batteries is to fashion
the cathode active material from micronsized
single crystals instead of polycrystalline aggre
gates.2 Single crystal layered materials such as
LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) have demon
strated unprecedented cycling life in laboratory
environments, theoretically enabling batteries
which could operate for many decades.3,4 This
is due to the lack of defects and grain bound
aries which concentrate stress.5 Cracks nucle
ate and propagate from these features, lead
ing to pulverization, lowered capacity, and an
increase of internal resistance over time.6,7 In
tracrystal heterogeneities and fracturing there
fore limit the maximum useful cycling rate, the
maximum cell voltage, and the stability of the
surface.4,6,810
Manufacturing highperformance active ma
terials at scale with controlled crystal quality
is challenging.
