Description:
A neutral sugar that is part of the branched regions in pectin.

Text:
The linear HG structure is interrupted by branched 
regions composed of (12)lrhamnose units (RGI regions) further binding 
neutral sugars including galactose, arabinose, xylose, and fructose.4 

Besides apple pomace, lemon or orange citrus processing waste (CPW, dried 
or fresh if the pectin plant is close to the citrus processing plant) is the main 
raw material for commercial pectin production based on prolonged acid 
hydrolysis using mineral acid in hot water followed by vacuum evaporation and 
alcohol precipitation.2 Between 2013 and 2018, close to 500 new food and 
beverage products employed pectin as stabilizer, whereas the second most 
use hydrocolloid (carboxymethylcellulose) slightly exceeded 100.3 Said 
commercial 
pectin, 
however, 
is 
very 
different 
from 
the 
native 
heteropolysaccharide abundant in the pericarp of citrus fruits.
