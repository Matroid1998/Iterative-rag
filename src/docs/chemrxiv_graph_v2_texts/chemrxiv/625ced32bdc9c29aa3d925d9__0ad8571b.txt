Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as qPCR have remained the primary 
intervention for the detection and containment of a pathogenmediated disease outbreak and also for 
screening genetic diseases, food soiling, and biowarfare prevention. The utility of NAATs is, however, 
dependent on the quality of nucleic acid templates being used, where the presence of DNA polymerase 
inhibitors may affect its efficacy as well as accuracy1. Silicabased spincolumn kits, magnetic particles, 
or automated extractionamplification systems could be utilized to extract nucleic acid from the sample 
of interest. Despite established sensitivity, automated extraction systems remain expensive with high 
per sample cost2, while silicabased spincolumn kits require centralized highspeed centrifuges. Commercial magnetic particles, either silica or carboxyl coated, or pHmodulated chargeswitching 
chitosanbased, are costly.
