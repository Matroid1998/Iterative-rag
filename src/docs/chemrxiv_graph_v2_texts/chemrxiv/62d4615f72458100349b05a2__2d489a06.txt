Description:
Undergoes photooxidation to benzaldehyde in the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide.

Text:
Heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a vibrant research field13 with possible applications 
ranging from water detoxification4 to solar fuel generation5 and chemical synthesis.68 Due to 
its simplicity, selective photooxidation of benzyl alcohols is often employed in photocatalysis 
as a model reaction for evaluation of the performance of various photocatalysts.915 A 
prominent example is the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide, an attractive high
value compound that can be employed as a fuel or a versatile and nontoxic oxidizing agent 
in various industrial processes, via reduction of dioxygen with concomitant photooxidation of 
benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.1618 As a rule, a blank test intended to confirm the 
photocatalytic nature of the reaction is performed by irradiating the solution of benzyl alcohol 
or other electron donor in the absence of photocatalyst, thus ruling out possible photochemical 
reactions which the substrate might undergo.

Description:
Undergoes oxidation to benzaldehyde in the presence of a TiO2 photocatalyst and irradiation.

Text:
The same experiments performed in the 
presence of a TiO2 photocatalyst showed that benzaldehyde was produced immediately upon 
starting irradiation; however, when the TiO2 photocatalysts was extracted after a certain time 
interval, the benzyl alcohol oxidation clearly proceeded further and the benzaldehyde 
concentration continued to grow. In other words, one can assume that the formed 
benzaldehyde initiated a photochemical reaction with benzyl alcohol leading to the oxidation 
of the latter according to the mechanism adapted from Bradshaw21, Heyes22 and Pavan20 and 
shown in Scheme 1.
