Description:
A feedstock for ethylene production through cracking.

Ethylene is one of the most important platform chemicals due to its application as monomer in 
35 
polymer production and as reactant for the production of intermediate products such as 
36 
dichloroethane, ethylene oxide, ethyl benzene and vinyl acetate.1,2 The conventional route for the 
37 
production of ethylene is the cracking of naphta or recently, the production from bioethanol by 
38 
dehydration. The cracking conditions mainly favour the formation of olefins as well as the 
39 
formation of smaller amounts of multi unsaturated compounds.1 High purity ethylene streams are 
40 
required especially in polymer production to ensure reproducible product qualities.
