Description:
A promising two-dimensional material with high specific surface area.

Text:
Graphene oxide (GO) is a promising twodimensional (2D) material with high specific 
surface area. As a graphene derivate, its carbon skeleton is decorated with oxygen 
functionalities, which largely limits its electrical conductivity and application in 
electrochemical energy storage, especially in supercapacitors.

Description:
A compound that can be chemically reduced to produce reduced graphene oxide.

Therefore, reducing GO 
to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has become a widely used method for 
obtaining high performance electrode materials with a high conductivity and large 
specific surface area.1 Among the large number of methods to reduce graphene 
oxide, chemical reduction is one of the most investigated methods since it is simple, 
costeffective and scalable.2 However, chemical reduction of GO usually involves 
organic solvents and toxic reductants which are environmental friendly .3 Recently, 
reducing GO with green and efficient reductant in aqueous solution has attracted 
many interests, and vitamin C (VC) is one of the most promising green reductants 
which is water soluble and can provide an efficiency as high as those conventional 
reductants.3 With such favorable features, using VC to reduce GO may still cause 
some unfavorable changes of the materials that is similar to other chemical reduction 
methods, for example, the destruction of laminar structure and morphology.
