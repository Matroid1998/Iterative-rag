Description:
Emitted in quantities of 2 to 9 tons for every ton of hydrogen produced through steam methane reforming.

Clean and sustainable energy production and storage is the major challenge for mankind today 14. Although clean energy can be produced economically from aeolian, hydro, solar, etc., only a minor 
part is stored, since as yet, there is no perfect energy storage technology 5. Hydrogen offers a viable 
approach with a large storage capacity of 142 MJkg. At present, more than 95 of the hydrogen 
produced is obtained by steam methane reforming. Although this is the most efficient technology 
known at present ( 70 efficiency 6), this way of producing hydrogen is far from being clean or 
sustainable, since for every ton of hydrogen produced, 2 to 9 tons of CO2 are emitted depending on 
the details of the process.
