Description:
A mononuclear complex selected for high-pressure studies due to its well-known magnetic properties.

Text:
Neverthe
less, in both examples the applied pressure induced the loss of 
crystallinity due to the release of solvent molecules42 or phase 
transition.43 
The mononuclear complex of formula Dy(tta)3(L)C6H14 (tta 
 22thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L  4,5bis(propylthio)
tetrathiafulvalene2(2pyridyl)benzimidazolemethyl2pyri
dine) was selected from our library of compounds for high pres
sure studies because its magnetic properties are experimentally 
and computationally wellknown,44 magnetic dilutions and iso
topic enrichment studies were performed4547 as well as spectro
electrochemistry investigations.48 Moreover the nuclear spin 
free 162Dy(III) (I  0) ion was chosen to cancel the hyperfine 
coupling and to diminish the underbarrier magnetic relaxation 
mechanisms. Therefore, here we present the highpressure sin
gle crystal Xray diffraction study and magnetic investigations 
of 162Dy(tta)3(L)C6H14 (162Dy). The magnetic measurements 
are 
completed 
by 
those 
of 
the 
diluted 
analogue 
162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)C6H14 (162DyY).
