Description:
A sandwich-type POM used to investigate the influence of different transition metal ions, starting with cobalt centers.

Along these lines, we conducted a more detailed comparison 
of the anticancer activity of the Preysslertype POM, 
NaP5W303739,4244 
and 
the 
sandwichtype 
POM, 
Co4(PW9)2,40 based on the following selection criteria (a) 
both POMs exhibit stability at physiological pH,26,45,46 (b) 
NaP5W30 serves as a model compound for high tungstate 
loading, (c) sandwichtype POMs, such as Co4(PW9)2, offer 
the opportunity to investigate the influence of different 
transition metal ions, starting with cobalt centers in the 
following, as cobalt complexes have been of interest as 
anticancer agents.47 
Previous works have introduced modifications to the core 
inorganic 
structure 
of 
the 
POM,48,49
