Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most emitted anthropogenic greenhouse gas by mass and has been assessed to 
30 
be the source of 77 of the human contribution to the environmental climate challenges 1. Correspondingly, 
31 
the global CO2 emissions from industrial processes and combustion of fuels for energy production have 
32 
rapidly increased and reached an annual emission of 36.3 Gt in 2021 2. As a response to negate the global 
33 
growth of CO2 emissions, the development of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) processes, where CO2 is 
34 
captured and converted to valueadded products, have been intensified correspondingly to a projected 
35 
annual utilization potential of 300600 Mt CO2 for chemicals in 2050 and 10004200 Mt CO2 for fuels 3.
