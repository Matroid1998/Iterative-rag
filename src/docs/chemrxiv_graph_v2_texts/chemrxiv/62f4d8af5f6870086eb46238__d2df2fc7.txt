Description:
A versatile reagent extensively used in the synthesis of condensed pyrazoles.

Text:
Cyanoacetohydrazide is a versatile reagent as it contains five different 
functional groups ( cyano, active methylene, carbonyl, amido and hydrazino 
groups ) . Some of them could act as a nucleophile or as an electrophile. Also they 
could act in pairs as a bidentate reagent affording several probabilities . the 
predominance of which depends on the reaction conditions and the other reactants. 2 
Moreover, the versatility of this reagent could be extended to form condensed 
heterocycles via the involvement of more than two centers in the reaction course . 1

 In addition, cyanoacetohydrazide could be easily self  cyclized to afford a new 
versatile reagent namely 3amino5pyrazolone, which has extensive use in the 
synthesis of condensed pyrazoles1.
