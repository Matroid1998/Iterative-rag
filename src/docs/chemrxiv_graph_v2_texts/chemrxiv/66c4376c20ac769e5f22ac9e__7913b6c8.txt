Description:
Unstable and moisture sensitive at higher temperatures, leading to decomposition and potential safety concerns in lithium ion batteries.

Text:
Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the standard lithium salt for the stateoftheart 
commercial lithium ion batteries (LIBs). LiPF6 is the obvious winner over other lithium salts 
due to the virtue of its higher ionic conductivity (102 Scm1 at 25C), excellent anti
corrosion nature toward aluminum, and good anodic stability ( 4.2V vs. LiLi) 1. Nevertheless, there remains longstanding concerns over the safety of LiPF6 based lithium 
salts for LIB applications particularly at higher temperatures. LiPF6 is unstable and moisture 
sensitive at higher temperatures (60 C), which degrades to other decomposition products, 
and this eventually results in capacity fading and thermal runaway of the corresponding LIBs 
2.
