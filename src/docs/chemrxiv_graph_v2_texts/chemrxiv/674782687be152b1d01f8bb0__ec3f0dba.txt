Description:
Leads to poisoning of Ziegler-Natta catalysts in polymerization reactions.

Multi
41 
unsaturated impurities such as acetylene lead to poisoning of ZieglerNatta catalysts in 
42 
polymerization reactions.35 Therefore, the generation of ethylenerich streams with acetylene 
43 
concentrations lower than 1 ppm are necessary.37 
44 
Industrially, two main operating methods are commonly used for acetylene removal, tailend and 
45 
frontend operation. In the first case, the acetylene removal unit is located after the deethanizer. 46 
The feed contains only C2fractions and stoichiometrically added hydrogen.610 The low hydrogen 
47 
concentration guarantees a high selectivity for conversion of acetylene to ethylene avoiding the 
48 
overhydrogenation to ethane. However, it favors increased oligomer and green oil formation 
49 
leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes in the acetylene hydrogenation.
