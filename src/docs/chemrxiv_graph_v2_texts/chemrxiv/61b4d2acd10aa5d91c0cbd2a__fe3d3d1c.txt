Description:
The most successful VitD analog prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis.

Text:
Critically, VitD is also implicated in a number of 
biological processes specifically through the regulation of the transcription of hundreds of genes 
in a cellspecific fashion. As a consequence, starting in the 1950s, an enormous amount of effort 
was expended by medicinal chemists to search for VitD analogs that could exhibit pro
differentiating and antiproliferative effects on normal and cancer cells as well as 
immunomodulatory effects without causing hypercalcemia.1,3 Such programs resulted in the 

synthesis of 3000 modified VitD analogs and the commercial launch of about a dozen new 
medicines (e.g. Hectorol, Zemplar, Calcijex, Rocaltrol).3c,4 Calcipotriol (7, DovonexTM, LEO 
Pharma) is currently the most successful VitD analog and is prescribed for the treatment of 
psoriasis, an autoimmune skin disease. Figure 1.
