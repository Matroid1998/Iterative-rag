Description:
A gas resulting from the combustion of carbon-containing fuels, contributing to atmospheric buildup and global warming.

Text:
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a critical component for plant life and thus animal and human life. Combustion of carboncontaining fuels to CO2 allows humans to live almost anywhere on Earth 
and provides power for industrial production. However, as shown in Figure 1, rapid growth of 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations has undesired consequences including global warming where the 
past 40 years have seen temperatures rise at a rate (0.18Cdecade) that is more than twice that 

3
(0.08Cdecade) in the 100 years prior. 1 CO2 emissions from naturally preexisting and 
anthropogenic activities outweigh uptake and sequestration pathways, resulting in a cumulative 
buildup of atmospheric CO2 levels. Thus, global warming, atmospheric CO2 levels, and world 
population are interconnected.

A greenhouse gas with atmospheric levels of 417 parts per million as of 2021, contributing to global warming.

Today, our global population is almost 8 billion and atmospheric CO2 levels are 417 parts per 
million (ppm).5 Land use changes and fossilfuels usage account for 40 billion metric tonsyear 
CO2 emissions globally as of 2021. 6, 7 In comparison, world population was  2.5 billion in 1950 
and the global CO2 emissions were estimated at 11.5 billion metric tonsyear. According to the 
predictions by an Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), global warming is likely 
to reach 1.5C between 2030 to 2052 (relative to preindustrial levels between 18501900). Due 
to the farreaching ecological consequences the international community adopted significant CO2
emissions reduction targets (race to zero by 2050) in 2015 at the 21st Conference of Parties on 
Climate Change. 8
