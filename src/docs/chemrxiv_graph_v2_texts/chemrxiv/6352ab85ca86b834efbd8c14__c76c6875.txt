Play a crucial role in several classes of drugs for cancer treatment.

Several nitro and aminoincorporated sulfides are reported as 
biologically active moieties widely used in the treatment of 
inflammation, Alzheimers, HIV, breast cancer, malarial diseases 
and fungal related conditions.4b, 5 Similarly, vinyl sulfones play a 
crucial role in several classes of drugs for cancer treatment.6 
Synthetic routes to diaryl sulfides have been investigated 
thoroughly,7 and most common routes involve a transition metal
catalyzed 
crosscoupling 
between 
thiophenols 
or 
other 
organosulfur reagents and aryl halides or aryl boronic acids.
