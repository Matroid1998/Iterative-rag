magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, particularly 27Al NMR,
has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the local environments
of aluminium atoms in zeolites.57 Several studies have attempted
to correlate experimental 27Al NMR spectra with specific Tsites in
the zeolite framework.813 However, sizable inconsistencies in the
calculated chemical shifts reported in these studies illustrate the
continuing challenges faced by researchers in this field. Interpreting solidstate NMR spectra can be challenging due to
signal broadening and overlap.
