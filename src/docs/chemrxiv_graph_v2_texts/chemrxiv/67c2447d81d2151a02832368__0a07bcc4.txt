Description:
Widely used as a basic scaffold for delivery systems in gene editing and transfection applications.

Polymers are promising nonviral delivery vehicles for
gene editing and therapy applications, offering a safer and
more versatile alternative to viral vectors, which face chal
lenges like immunogenicity, limited capacity, and high pro
duction costs1,2. Polymers bind and compact DNA or RNA
cargo into nanoparticle complexes, called polyplexes, for
delivery into cells3. Among the most popular polymer
systems is polyethyleneimine (PEI), sold commercially as
jetPEI, which is widely used as a basic scaffold for deliv
ery systems employed in routine transfection and gene editing
applications48. Despite their potential, PEIbased systems still face sig
nificant limitations in achieving the high delivery efficien
cies required for clinical use9. A critical factor influencing
efficiency is the formation and stability of polyplexes10,11.
