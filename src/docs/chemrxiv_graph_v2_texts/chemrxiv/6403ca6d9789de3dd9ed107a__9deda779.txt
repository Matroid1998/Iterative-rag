Description:
Used in enantioselective conjugate addition with indolizines catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid.

Text:
disclosed a Bronsted acidcatalyzed 
protocol to the C3functionalization of indolizines, which focused on orthomethide 
quinones as substrates (Scheme 1a).7b paraMethide quinones (used as substrate or 
generated in situ from dehydration of a parahydroxybenzyl alcohol) were also shown to 
be suitable electrophilic partners in this reaction, nevertheless only two examples were 
reported and in moderate yields. Consequently, the former examples of alkylation of 
indolizines with pQMs suffered from limited scope in terms of both reactants. In previous works carried out by our research group, we have developed some 
synthetic methodologies exploring indolizines as substrates in conjugated additions to 
,unsaturated systems. In 2017, the enantioselective conjugate addition of indolizines 
to enones catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid (S)TRIP was explored.
