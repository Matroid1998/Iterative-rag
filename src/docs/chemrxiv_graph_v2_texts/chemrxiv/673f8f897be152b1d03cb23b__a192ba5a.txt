Crystallizes in a centrosymmetric trigonal structure.

The exploration for precious metals in natural sources
led to the discovery of Ag3AuSe2 (fischesserite) and
Ag3AuTe2 (petzite) in the nature in the early 1900s.1,2
They were identified to have stoichiometric compositions
and share the chiral cubic I4132 space group, as deter
mined by Xray diffraction. Ag3AuS2 crystallizes in a
centrosymmetric trigonal structure3 and is not the focus
of this study. Early research on Ag3AuSe2 and Ag3AuTe2 explored
structural transitions at high temperatures using dif
ferential thermal analysis (DTA) and Xray diffraction
(XRD).47 Both compounds have similar melting points
around 730 C and undergo multiple phase transitions at
elevated temperatures. Although synthesis of Ag3AuSe2
and Ag3AuTe2 have been reported,58 experimental data
on the physical and chemical properties of the synthetic
samples remain limited.
