Description:
2D materials with the stoichiometry MX that exhibit auxetic behavior.

Text:
The auxeticity of
these materials lead to many special properties
like
enhancement
of
plane
strain
fracture
resistance,
increment
of
fracture
toughness,
shear modulus and even boosting of acoustic
response.4
Several 2D materials, including graphene oxide,
transition metal selenides, and transition metal
halides with the stoichiometry MX (where M
represents elements such as V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
and X represents elements like Se, Cl, Br, I),
exhibit
auxetic
behavior.5,6
Although
most
auxetic materials with homogenous (NPR for all
directions) values are either Porous foams or
specifically
designed
metamaterials,79
John
Dagdelen et. al10 came up with three distinctive
types of auxetic crystals and discovered some
new auxetic compounds. Later, Chivani et al11
reported a few more auxetic materials.
