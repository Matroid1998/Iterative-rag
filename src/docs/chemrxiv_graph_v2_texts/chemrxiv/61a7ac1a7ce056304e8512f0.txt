Description:
An inert noble gas used as a filler gas for lamps, anaesthetic and imaging agent in medicine, propellant for ion thrusters, gain medium for lasers, and medium to detect ionizing radiation.

Text:
The inert, noble gases xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), and argon (Ar) have several industrial applications,
such as ller gas for lamps (Xe, Kr, Ar), insulation in multiplepane windows (Xe, Kr, Ar), anaesthetic
and imaging agent in medicine (Xe), propellant for ion thrusters on spacecraft (Xe), gain medium for
lasers (Xe, Kr, Ar), and medium to detect and measure ionizing radiation (Ar, Xe). Ar is used in bulk
quantities, as a protective gas, during the production of metals and semiconductors. 1,2
Xe, Kr, and Ar naturally occur in the atmosphere of the earth at 0.0000086 mol , 0.000114 mol , and
0.9300 mol , respectively (troposphere, dry conditions) 1.

Description:
A fission product that evolves from spent nuclear fuel during reprocessing.

The task of capturing dilute Xe andor Kr from air is encountered in (i) the reprocessing and recycling
of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) 46 and (ii) the detection of nuclear explosions from (banned) nuclear
weapons tests 3, 7. Expanding on (i), reprocessing and recycling the large US inventory of SNF 8
would recover unused ssile material for new fuel assemblies and reduce the volume of radioac
tive waste to sequester 9,10. However, radioactive isotopes of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) (ssion
products) evolve from the SNF during reprocessing (400 ppm 127Xe, 40 ppm 85Kr in the ogases),
which must be captured and (particularly, 85Kr) sequestered as opposed to released into the atmo
sphere 6.
