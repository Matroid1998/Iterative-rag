Whereas predicting retention times
is relatively straightforward for polymeric biomolecules such as peptides2 and oligonucleotides3,
it turned out to be an extremely challenging problem for socalled small molecules (meaning
molecules with a mass smaller than 1000 Dalton). In the following, we will concentrate on small
molecules of biological interest, or biomolecules for short Small biomolecules include primary and
secondary metabolites, drugs and drug degradation products, as well as toxic small molecules such
as tetrodotoxin, the poison of the fugu fish. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous substances in
biological samples or even biosystems is nowadays referred to as metabolomics. Despite four decades of development1,4,5 and literally hundreds of published machine learning
models, retention time prediction for small molecules is still far from being in everyday use.
