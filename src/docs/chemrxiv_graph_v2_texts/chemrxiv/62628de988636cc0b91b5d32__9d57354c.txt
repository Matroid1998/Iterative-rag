Description:
Precursors that include alkenes and alkynes, used to increase molecular complexity.

Unsaturated hydrocarbons 
such as alkenes and alkynes represent another important class of precursors (Figure 1b). Hydrometalation and carbometalation across unsaturated bonds provide highly useful reactive 
organometallic species such as alkyl and alkenyl metals.712 A key advantage of metalating 
unsaturated bonds is to increase molecular complexity and values by starting from simple 
unsaturated compounds such as alkynes, which are among the most prevalent and primitive 
structures in organic molecules. Naturally, the subsequent conversion of the resulting carbon
metal bond offers straightforward routes to target molecules. Given the unparalleled importance of the monometalation like hydrometalation and 
carbometalation, 1,2dimetalation of unsaturated bonds would be a fascinating transformation. For example, twoelectron reduction of alkynes should ideally lead to 1,2dimetalation (Figure
