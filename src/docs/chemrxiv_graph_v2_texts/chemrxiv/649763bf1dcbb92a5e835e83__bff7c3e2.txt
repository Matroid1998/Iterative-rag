Description:
Used as an electrolyte salt.

Text:
Here, it is investigated if there is a more systematic correlation between lithium
concentration in the electrolyte and the observed T1 relaxation time constant in the
solid using a concentration series of the electrolyte salt. The observed results are
modeled using a simple twophase equilibrium for lithium, the limits of this model are
discussed, and an approach for a more quantitative model is suggested. 2 Sample and Experiment Details
All preparation steps were done in a glove box with argon atmosphere. For each
experiment a Youngtype NMR tube was filled with 100 mg of nanoLTO powder
from SigmaAldrich, and 1.5 mL of an electrolyte was added. Electrolytes con
sisted of dimethylcarbonate (DMC) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide.
