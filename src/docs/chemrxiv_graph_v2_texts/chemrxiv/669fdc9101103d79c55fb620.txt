Description:
A crucial component of cytochromes involved in the electron transport chain in mitochondria.

Text:
While primarily renowned for its role in oxygen transport 
and storage within hemoglobin and myoglobin,1 iron fulfils nu
merous other critical roles.2 Iron is a crucial component of cyto
chromes involved in the energyproviding electron transport chain 
in mitochondria.3 Ribonucleotide reductase, an irondependent 
enzyme, is necessary for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, 
the building blocks of DNA crucial for cell division and repair.4,5 
Iron also acts as a cofactor for various enzymes responsible for 
protection from oxidative stress6,7 or for the synthesis or degrada
tion of hormones and neurotransmitters.810 Nature has developed 
a sophisticated system to tightly regulate irons uptake and home
ostasis through proteins and hormones like transferrin, ferroportin, 
ferritin and hepcidin.11 This system ensures a delicate balance 
between meeting physiological iron needs and preventing the 
adverse effects of iron overload.

Description:
Its levels are reduced in response to inflammation to restrict availability to pathogens.

Text:
For instance, in response to 
inflammation, iron levels are reduced to restrict its availability to 
pathogens, but it can also impair immune cell function by restrict
ing their iron supply.1214 Artificial systems that mimic these 
functions or exert spatiotemporal control over iron levels are 
consequently attractive in the context of potential biomedical 
applications. Ferrocene (Fc) with its captivating sandwich structure with a 
central iron atom represents one of the most studied organometal
lic compounds since its discovery in the early 1950s.15 Its popu
larity can be attributed to a unique combination of its redox chem
istry, structural fluxionality, and exceptional chemical and photo
chemical stability that parallels that of aromatic compounds.
