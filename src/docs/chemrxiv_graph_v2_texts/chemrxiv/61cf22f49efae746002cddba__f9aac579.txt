Description:
Ring-substituted ECPP used as an intermediate in synthesis.

Text:
Electrophilic arylfunctionalized trisubstituted ethylenes, ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2
propenoates, RPhCHC(CN)CO2C2H5 (ECPP) continue to attract attention as organic 
intermediates and compounds with useful properties. Thus, acetoxy ringsubstituted ECPP 
was used as intermediate in microwavepromoted sequential threecomponent synthesis of 
tetrahydrobenzobpyran in water catalyzed by heterogeneous amine grafted on silica 1, in 
Knoevenagel reactions catalyzed by nanosilica PAMAM dendrimer 2 and by amine 
supported on silica gel 3. 4Acetamido ECPP was involved in studies of enaminones in heterocyclic syntheses as a 
new onestep synthetic route to pyrrolo3,4bpyridine and convenient syntheses of 1,4
dihydropyridines and 1,1(1,4phenylene)bis(1,4dihydropyridine) 4. It was also used 
as nonlinear optical material based on cyano(acetylamino)cinnamate ester 5. 2Cyano 
ECPP was used in studies of structureactivity relationships and brain uptake of a novel 
series of benzopyran inhibitors of insulinregulated aminopeptidase 6.
