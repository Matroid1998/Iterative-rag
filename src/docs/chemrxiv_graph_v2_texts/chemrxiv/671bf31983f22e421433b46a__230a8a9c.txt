Materials with favorable optoelectronic properties used in LEDs, photovoltaics, and photodetectors.

In the continuing pursuit of highly efficient renewable 
energy technologies, halide perovskites (HPs) have become 
ubiquitous in the semiconductor research community in just 
over the last decade. Their favorable optoelectronic properties 
for applications including lightemitting diodes (LEDs), 
photovoltaics (PVs), and photodetectors,(1) demonstrate the 
wide utility of these materials. The word perovskite describes 
the crystal structure of the material and can be simplified to the 
formula ABX3, where, for HPs, A is a monovalent cation, typically 
Cs, CH3NH3 (methylammonium, MA), andor CHNH2NH2 
(formadinium, FA); B is a divalent cation, typically Pb2, Sn2, 
andor Ge2; and X is a monovalent halide, typically Cl, Br, 
andor I. In terms of optical response, HPs have been shown to 
have remarkable luminescent properties.
