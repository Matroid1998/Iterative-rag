Description:
Binds with carbon atoms in nitrogen-doped graphite conjugated catalysts.

To address this gap, the development of 
designer nitrogendoped materials with welldefined active sites has been pursued by multiple 
groups.19,20 
These studies support the critical conclusion that carbons adjacent to pyridinic moieties are 
responsible for the oxygen reduction activity in these catalysts but raised further questions 
about the source of this activity. In the case of a previous study by Ricke et al. which focused on 
one particular nitrogendoped graphite conjugated catalyst (NGCC), there was only a single 
carbon atom in the catalyst that would form a bond with O2.19 This activity could not be solely a 
result of the pyridinic nitrogen acting as an orthopara activator to the aromatic system, as the 
alternate carbon ortho to the pyridinic nitrogen would not bind O2.
