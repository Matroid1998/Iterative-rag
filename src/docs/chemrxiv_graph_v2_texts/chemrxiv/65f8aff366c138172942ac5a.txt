On the fundamental aspect, unavoidable volume expansion in each crystalline grain of
silicon upon lithiation creates important mechanical stress in the material, responsible for
rupture. A major mechanism to relieve this stress would be to allow facile sliding at the
grain boundaries.26,27 Previous experimental observations of GB sliding have been predomi
nantly limited to metallic materials such as Al, Cu, Sn, Zn, and Mg.2832 To our knowledge,
there has been no work in the literature for GB sliding in silicon. This comes from the fact
that silicon has strong covalent bonds, which may render GB sliding highly activated and
inoperative at near ambient temperature.
