Description:
Salts used as electrophilic arylating reagents.

In recent years, the chemistry of hypervalent iodine compounds experienced an immersive 
grow resulting in a plethora of applications in organic synthesis,1,2 including the oxidation of 
alcohols,3,4 CHoxidations4 and phenol dearomatizations.5 Besides their remarkable 
reactivity as dehydrogenative oxidants, in particular aryl3iodanes turned out to be potent 
electrophilic group transfer reagents.6 The most prominent representatives are diaryliodonium 
salts as electrophilic arylating reagents,7 alkenyl(aryl)iodonium salts as electrophilic vinyl 
motives8 and alkynyl(aryl)iodonium salts for electrophilic alkyne transfer reactions.9 In the 
latter, thermal stability is a latent problem.10 Here, intermolecular stabilization by oxygen
based donors in the form of ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX) revealed a significantly 
increased thermal stability and hence an improved synthetic utilization of alkynylsubstituted 
iodanes (Figure 1).11

reagents.
