of stronger electrondonating bithiophene linker. The peaktopeak separation (Epp) for 
each wave is ca. 60 mV, indicating their good reversibility. In Figure 3b, the differential pulse 
voltammograms (DPV) further confirm the fourelectron reduction processes of 1 and 2, and the 
patterns are consistent with the CV. The CV of 3 is almost identical with that of 2 (Figure S9). In 
addition, a negligible loss of signal is observed in both cases after 10 continuous CV cycles at a scan 
rate of 100 mVs, suggesting their excellent electrochemical stability. Overall, each carbonyl 
pyridinium unit can serve as twoelectron storage unit. As such, compounds 1 and 2 can store up to 
four electrons per molecule. To make it more intuitive, the fourelectron transfer processes are depicted 
in Figure 3c.
