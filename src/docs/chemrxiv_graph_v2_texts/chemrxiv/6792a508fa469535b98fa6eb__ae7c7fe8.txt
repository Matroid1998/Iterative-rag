Exhibits a layered structure resembling the natural mineral tobermorite.

C(A)SH is the main hydration product of Portland cement
(most common type of cement) , accounting for about 5060
of the total volume of hydrates7. C(A)SH exhibits a layered
calciumsilicate structure resembling the natural mineral tober
morite8. In contrast to the tobermorite minerals the silicate
chain structures is defective (missing silicates) and the interlayer
space contains a higher amount of ions, most notably Ca2 and
OH 8,9. These features give C(A)SH its nanocrystalline char
acter, as observed by Xray diffraction, where characteristic re
flections are seen and are assigned to repeating distances in the
calciumsilicate mainlayer1012. Most of the fundamental knowledge about the C(A)SH struc
ture derives from the coupling of solidstate nuclear magnetic res
onance (NMR, mainly 29Si, 27Al and 1H) and atomistic simula
tions1317.
