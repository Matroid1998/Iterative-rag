Description:
A type of plastic that can be repolymerized to retain original properties.

Text:
Sorted plastic waste (in the form of a mixed bale) undergo a series of chemical con
versions including pyrolysis and steam cracking to arrive at pure plastic monomers (olens), which
can nally be repolymerized into products with the same original properties as virgin plastics (here,
we target lowdensity polyethylene and polypropylene, which are two of the most dominant plas
tics 21. The ability of going back to original virgin plastics enables the creation of a circular plastics
economy. Recent work has analyzed opportunities presented by upcycling and highlighted the potential
contributions of such pathways to plastic waste management 21, 17, 8, 19, 28. Substantial work has
also been devoted in analyzing the economic and environmental performance of various upcycling
pathways 15, 22, 25.
