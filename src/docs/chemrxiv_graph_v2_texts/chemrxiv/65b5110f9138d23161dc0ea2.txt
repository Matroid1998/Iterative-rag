Description:
Subject to chemoselective reduction.

Text:
Selectivity is an important feature in organic reactions. The three most common are 
chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. Chemoselective reactions are those with 
a preference for one of two or more possible reactive entities (eg same functional groups).1,2

Regioselective reactions are primarily associated with addition reactions to nonsymmetric 
alkenes, alkynes, and aromatic compounds. By definition, adding a unique functionality on either 
site (region) of the substrate generates a unique molecule. Regioselective reactions show a 
preference for one site (region). E.g.
