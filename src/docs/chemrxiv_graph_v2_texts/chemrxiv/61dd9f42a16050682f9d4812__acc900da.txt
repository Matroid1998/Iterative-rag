Description:
Materials used in organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

Text:
In the last decade, organic materials have shown promise due to their tunability (e.g., in terms of light 
absorption), and their potential to be produced inexpensively on large scale.12,13 Although organic photo
catalysts were investigated widely after the first report of carbon nitride in 2009,16 most studies have 
been confined to sacrificial halfreactions that produce either hydrogen or oxygen, not both.1721 Few 
organic photocatalysts have been reported for overall water splitting. Carbon nitride materials have been 
coupled with metal oxides to facilitate overall water splitting in so called Zschemes, whereby hydrogen 
evolution occurs on the organic photocatalyst while oxygen evolution occurs on the metal oxide.

Description:
Active for photocatalytic overall water splitting when loaded with PtCoOx as a cocatalyst.

Text:
Most reported systems require a metal cocatalyst to archive overall water 
splitting.27,29,30 This is because metal cocatalysts facilitate charge separation,31 store charges, and serve 
as reaction sites that catalyze water oxidation and reduction.24,32,33 As such, much effort has been spent 
in the development of cocatalysts for photocatalysis.34,35 For example, carbon nitride loaded with 
PtCoOx as cocatalyst was reported to be active for photocatalytic overall water splitting.36 Similarly, a 
covalent triazinebased framework loaded with NiPxPt was reported to act as a single component pho
tocatalyst for overall water splitting.37 Here, we explored the homopolymer of dibenzob,dthiophene sul
fone (P10, Fig. 1a), which was shown previously to drive both proton reduction38 and water oxidation39 
as separate halfreactions in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors or acceptors.
