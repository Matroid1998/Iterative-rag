Description:
An intermediate in the shikimate pathway involved in producing L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and L-tryptophan.

Polyphenols are a complex family of molecules that contain at least one hydroxy group attached
to an aromatic ring. This molecular family can be separated into several distinct classes based on
the backbone structure (Fig. 1a) 1. Polyphenols are prevalent phytochemicals found in various
plants and fungi. They are derived from secondary metabolite pathways which are not yet
completely understood. For example, they can derive from the shikimate pathway which involves
producing Lphenylalanine, Ltyrosine, and Ltryptophan from the intermediate shikimic acid and
these three amino acids are the building blocks for various polyphenols 2. The production of
polyphenols is modulated by both, biotic and abiotic, stress of the plants and fungi, such as
herbivores, UV radiation or temperature 2. Polyphenols are involved in various biological
processes, e.g.
