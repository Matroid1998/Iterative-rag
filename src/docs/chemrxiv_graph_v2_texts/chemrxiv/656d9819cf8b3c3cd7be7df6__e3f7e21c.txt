Description:
A support material for TiCl4 in the Ziegler-Natta catalyst.

Text:
The heterogeneous ZieglerNatta (ZN) catalyst has detained the monopoly over industrial 
polypropylene (PP) production owing to its high activity and stereospecificity. It facilitates the 
production of a significant quantity of highquality PP under mild reaction conditions and at a 
low cost. In its modern form, the catalyst consists of a precatalyst that involves TiCl4 supported 
on nanosized MgCl2, along with an organic Lewis basic modifier referred to as the internal 
donor (ID). This precatalyst becomes active with the introduction of alkylaluminum, often 
accompanied by an additional Lewis base called the external donor (ED).1 The inclusion of 
these donors marked a significant advancement in PP production, owing to a substantial 
improvement in both the stereospecificity and activity of the catalyst.
