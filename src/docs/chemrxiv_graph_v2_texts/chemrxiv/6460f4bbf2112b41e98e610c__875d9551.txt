Description:
Used in a reaction to obtain product 3h with a yield of 59.

Text:
of steric hindrance by orthosubstituents (3de) led to lower product yields 

(7866), and small amounts of biphenyl were observed by GCMS as expected. Substrates containing 
metasubstituents were also competent coupling partners (3f), although not as efficient as those with 
parasubstituents. Electronwithdrawing substituents also led to lower yields (3g). Product 3h, obtained 
from reaction of 4fluoroiodobenzene, was obtained in 59 yield along with 16 of pterphenyl. Considering that 4fluorobiphenyl (3h) is an unsuitable substrate in this reaction, yielding 0 p
terphenyl after 16 h (see SI), it is highly unlikely that the formation of terphenyl arises through a second 
initiation of 3h and instead could indicate radical anion intermediates (see below),40 which provides 
evidence that a BHAS mechanism is in operation. When 1(allyloxy)2iodobenzene was employed, 
product 3i was obtained.
