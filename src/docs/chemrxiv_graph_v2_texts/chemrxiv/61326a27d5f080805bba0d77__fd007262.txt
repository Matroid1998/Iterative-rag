Description:
A synthetic polymer used in the formation of hydrogels.

Hydrogels have become a very important class of materials, 
with the global sales reaches approximately 1520 billion U.S. 
dollars annually.1 Since their first demonstrated application in 
1960,2 hydrogels have found uses in many different areas such 
as contact lenses, wound dressings, cosmetics, drug delivery 
systems, tissue engineering, agriculture, and hygiene products.3 
Hydrogels can be made of synthetic polymers such as 
polyethyleneglycol (PEG), natural polymers such as gelatin and 
collagen, or hybrids of natural and synthetic polymers.4 The 
choice of polymers and crosslinkers is crucial, as this affects the 
final properties of the hydrogel. Pore size, mechanical 
properties, swelling ratio, swelling rate, biodegradability, 
biocompatibility, chemical resistance, optical properties, and 
stimuli responsiveness are additional important hydrogel 
properties, which must be tailored according to the application.
