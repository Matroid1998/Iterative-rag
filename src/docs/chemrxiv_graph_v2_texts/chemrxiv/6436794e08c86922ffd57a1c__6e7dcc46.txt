Description:
Exhibit inverted singlet and triplet states with the S1 excited state lower in energy than the T1 excited state.

Text:
By the use of wavefunctionbased electronicstructure methods instead of hitherto preferred time
dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methodology, it was discovered that azaphenalenes, 
such as cycl3.3.3azine, heptazine (heptaazaphenalene) and related triangular carbon nitrides or boron 
carbon nitrides exhibit inverted singlet and triplet states, that is, the S1 excited state is lower in energy 
than the T1 excited state.15 Although evidence of a possibly unusual singlettriplet spectrum was 
found in earlier spectroscopic investigations of several azaphenalenes, the inversion of the S1 and T1 
energies could not be firmly established at that time due to the difficulty of determining precise triplet 
excitation energies.6, 7 Recently, the inversion of S1 and T1 excited states in several derivatives of 
heptazine was unequivocally established by measurements of timeresolved photoluminescence decay, 
its temperature dependence, as well as transient absorption spectra.2, 8, 9 
 Organic molecules with nearly degenerate or inverted S1 and T1 states are primarily of interest as 
emitters in organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs).1013 While the majority of currently studied 
organic chromophores for OLED applications exhibit small positive S1T1 gaps and rely on the 
mechanism of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T1 to S1 at room temperature,14, 15 the 
discovery of organic chromophores with inverted (negative) S1T1 gaps has stimulated the vision of a 
new generation of OLED devices which exploit the fluorescence from inverted S1 states.3, 9, 16 Adachi 
and coworkers17, 18 and more recently Aizawa and coworkers9 synthesized several derivatives of 
heptazine and demonstrated their enhanced functionality in OLED devices.

Description:
Chromophores with a negative singlet-triplet gap and a triangular shape essential for alternating localization of HOMO and LUMO densities.

Text:
So far, all known chromophores with negative singlettriplet gap ST  ES1  ET1 are azaphenalenes 
or are closely related to these. Apparently, the triangular shape seems to be essential to allow the 
localization of the densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on alternate atomic sites.2, 5, 19, 20 This alternating localization 
pattern is the origin of the exceptionally small exchange integral.
