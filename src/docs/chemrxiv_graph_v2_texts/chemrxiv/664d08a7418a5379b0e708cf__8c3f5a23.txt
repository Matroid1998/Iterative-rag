Description:
Photoactive complex used as a photoredox catalyst due to appropriate RedOx potentials and photostability.

Dinuclear complexes combine a variety of useful properties due to the presence of two 
metallocenters in their structure, and owing to this feature they find applications in 
supramolecular assembles design, chemosensors, optoelectronic devices, smart materials, 
photoelectrodes components and photocatalysts14. Photoactive Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes with 
various polypyridine ligands (2,2bipyridine, 1,10phenanthroline, 2,26,2terpyridine, etc.) are frequently used as photoredox catalysts due to appropriate RedOx potentials, high extinction 
coefficients in the visible range of the spectrum, photostability and long lifetimes 5, 6. One of 
their application is dual catalysis (or metallaphotoredox catalysis), combining photocatalysis 
under visible light irradiation and catalysis by metal complexes 711. This metodology opens 
possibilities for the formation of carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom bonds under mild 
conditions thus enabling the synthesis of a wide range of valuable compounds 9.
