Description:
An antiinfluenza drug that prevents virion release from infected cells.

Text:
Sialidases (SAs) or neuraminidases, are glycoside hydrolases 
hydrolysing sialic acids, which are negativelycharged sugars 
widely present in animal species. Bacterial, parasitic and viral 
SAs have been reported as virulent factors used by the 
pathogens to i) feed on host sialic acids, ii) unmask binding 
ligands for cell colonization, or iii) form protective biofims.4 SA 
inhibitors may be relevant antiinfective agents,5 as illustrated 
by the approval of zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir 
(Tamiflu), two antiinfluenza drugs preventing virion release 
from infected cells. Academic research also focuses on 
developing selective inhibitors of human SAs,6,7 to impact 
cellular processes, and bacterial and parasitic SAs,8,9 as an 
alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatments facing 
increasing resistances.
