Description:
Crystalline microporous aluminosilicate networks used in industrial heterogeneous acid catalysis.

Text:
Aluminosilicates are industrially indispensable materials with a farreaching global 
commercial importance. Besides their more mundane use in construction materials and 
ceramics, their porous forms, most notably zeolites,1 represent the backbone of industrial 
heterogeneous acid catalysis. Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate 
networks where some of the SiO4 tetrahedra are replaced by AlO4, necessitating 
charge compensation by a loosely bound cation in the pore space. Protonation gives rise 
to wellunderstood intraframework Brnsted acid sites of the Si(2OH)Al type,2 which 
were in the past believed to be responsible for all the catalytic properties of these 
materials.

Description:
Materials that form Lewis acid sites as extraframework or framework-associated defects under high-temperature steaming and calcination to enhance catalytic activities and hydrothermal stabilities.

Text:
More recently, the presence and importance of Lewis acid sites have been 
uncovered and intensively studied.35 Such sites are not ordinarily present in freshly 
synthesized zeolites, but instead they are formed as extraframework or framework
associated defects under the harsh conditions of hightemperature steaming and 
calcination  procedures used to increase the catalytic activities and hydrothermal 
stabilities of zeolites prior to industrial use.
