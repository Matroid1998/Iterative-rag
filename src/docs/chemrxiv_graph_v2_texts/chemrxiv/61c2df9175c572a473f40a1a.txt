Description:
A potential sustainable energy carrier that does not emit pollutants or greenhouse gases during conversion processes.

Text:
Toward a sustainable energy cycle, H2 economy has been considered as one of the most 
promising solutions to overcome drawbacks of the current fossil fuel economy since it does not 
emit any pollutants or greenhouse gases during conversion processes1, 2. However, 96  of the 
current H2 production relies on thermochemical conversions of carbonbased fuels via pyrolysis, 
gasification and steam reforming of natural gas, requiring clean alternative methods2, 3. Water 
electrolysis has been investigated to produce green H2, which consists of H2 evolution reaction 
(HER) at the cathode and O2 evolution reaction (OER) at the anode4.
