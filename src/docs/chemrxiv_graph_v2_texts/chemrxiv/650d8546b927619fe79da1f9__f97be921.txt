The best performing solution-processed photovoltaic materials with a power conversion efficiency record of 26 in 2023.

Text:
The development of solutionprocessed optoelectronic materials based on abundant and nontoxic elements is 
of great interest for sustainable technological progress. In particular, lead halide perovskites are at present the 
best performing solutionprocessed photovoltaic materials, with a power conversion efficiency record of 26 in 
2023.1 Nevertheless, both the regulatory concerns due the presence of lead and poor stability under ambient 
operating conditions pose major barriers to their commercialization.

Description:
Materials with exceptional optoelectronic properties but have stability and toxicity drawbacks.

Text:
Lead is toxic and when released from the 
perovskite structure into the soil it is 10 times more bioavailable than other natural lead sources.24
The exceptional optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites, along with these stability and toxicity 
drawbacks, have spurred major research interest in perovskiteinspired materials.5,6 These are materials with 
similar structural andor chemical properties to the prototypical halide perovskites, but avoiding the presence 
of lead.
