Description:
A dissolved gas in geothermal fluids that can exsolve with changes in pressure and temperature.

Text:
The design and operation of a geothermal plant are heavily impacted by the phase behavior of the fluids 
extracted from the subsurface. The phase behavior of the aqueous fluid is a function of its composition 
and pressure  temperature conditions. Deep geothermal fluids are often highly saline (6 M) and 
contain dissolved gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2). Any change in pressure and temperature across the 
geothermal loop will disturb the existing equilibrium conditions, triggering mineral precipitation and 
gas exsolution until a new equilibrium is achieved.

Description:
The release of CO2 from the brine increases the pH, which promotes scaling.

Text:
For a given temperature and composition, the pressure at which the first bubble of gas appears is called 
the bubble point pressure. Operating in a twophase regime is usually undesired and can be avoided if 
the bubble point pressure is known. The amount of gas released from the aqueous solution upon pressure 
or temperature shifts impacts the aqueous chemistry and thermophysical properties of the geothermal 
mixture. For instance, the release of CO2 from the brine increases the pH, which promotes scaling. Changes in the gasliquidratio (GLR) in a twophase system alter the fluid density, specific heat,
