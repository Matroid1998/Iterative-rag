Description:
A positive control in antiinflammatory screens with an IC50 of 34.3 M.

To the best of our knowledge, this renders 2 one of only five natural MIAs (out of 3,000) to 
contain a cyclopropane.6 From a synthetic perspective, its unique 656635 hexacyclic ring system presents challenges not 
readily addressed via existing approaches to the sarpagine alkaloids. In addition, preliminary biological testing has shown 
rauvomine B (2) to be among the most active of its congeners in antiinflammatory screens, displaying inhibition of RAW 
264.7 macrophages (IC50  39.6 M; positive control, celecoxib IC50  34.3 M).1 Inspired by the unique structure of 
rauvomine B (2) and seeking to develop a new synthetic entry to the sarpagine family for further biological screening, we 
embarked upon a total synthesis of 2.
