Description:
A precursor in the synthetic pathway that is converted to prostaglandin (PG) G2.

Text:
The first step in the synthetic pathway is the conversion of 
arachidonic acid to the highly unstable prostaglandin (PG) G2, which rapidly forms PGH2, and is subsequently 
converted by other enzymes into several PGs, the most abundant of which is PGE2.6 
COX2 is overexpressed in several tumors, including colorectal, breast, stomach, lung, and pancreatic cancer.7 
Moreover, there are suggestions that higher levels of COX2 may be related to a bad prognosis for patients 
and that increased PG levels in cancer cells can also be caused by chemo and radiotherapy.8 Several studies 
highlight how COX2 is likely involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression, affecting aspects like 
xenobiotic metabolism, angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, immunosuppression, and invasiveness.9 Also, 
there is evidence for PGE2 to contribute in angiogenesis, tumor promotion, and cellular apoptosis 
resistance.10 The use of COX2 selective inhibitors is often addressed as a powerful tool in the fight against 
cancer.
