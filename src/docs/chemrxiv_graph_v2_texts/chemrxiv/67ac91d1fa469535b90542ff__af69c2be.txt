Description:
A leaving group in nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions.

Text:
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions are widely employed in both 
academic and industrial settings to structurally modify aromatic ring scaffolds.15 While the 
electronrich system in aromatic molecules typically makes them react as nucleophiles in 
substitution reactions,68 several strategies have been developed to render them susceptible 
to nucleophilic attack.1,6,911 The most common strategy involves functionalization of the 
aromatic ring with electronwithdrawing groups (EWGs), which reduce the electron density on 
the arene. This facilitates nucleophilic addition at the position bearing a leaving group, such 
as F or Cl, leading to the formation of a Xadduct (Fig. 1a), also known as the Jackson
Meisenheimer complex.
