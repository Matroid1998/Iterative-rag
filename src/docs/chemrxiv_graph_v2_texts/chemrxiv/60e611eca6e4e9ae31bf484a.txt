Description:
Small molecule metabolites measured in plasma.

Text:
We conducted this pilot study at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) to better characterize the changes seen in lipoproteins and other metabolites, in individuals 
with severe COVID19, using a clinically deployed NMR analyzer capable of measuring the 
particle number and size of different lipoprotein subfractions 17. Moreover, it allowed us to 
quantify the plasma levels of several small molecule metabolites, such as branchedchain amino 
acids (BCAAs) and ketone bodies 1820. Finally, we also determined the levels of GlycA, a 
composite NMR index of overall plasma protein Nglycosylation, previously established as a 
marker of systemic inflammation 21, 22. Methods
