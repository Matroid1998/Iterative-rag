Description:
Converted to nitriles via dehydration.

Text:
Nitrile and amide groups are all the key structures of natural products, biologically active molecules, agrochemicals, 
dyes, or materials science. In the past decade, nitriles were obtained from the conversion of oximes via dehydration,1 
as well as substitution reaction involving cyanogen reagents.26 In addition, carboxylic acid derivatives and amines 
are traditionally applied for the synthesis of amides via a condensation reaction, which needs to happen in harsh 
conditions.7 Unfortunately, most synthesis were performed with toxic reagents and cumbersome experimental 
operation. Though the great progress made in the generation of nitriles from aldehydes and have well applied in the 
wide substrate scope of aldehydes, there are few suitable methodologies for the synthesis of both nitrile and amide 
from aldehydes and ketone respectively.

Description:
Serve as precursors in the synthesis of nitriles or amides with phosgene or its substitutes.

Text:
Compared with traditional nucleophilic substitutions by using HCN or 
metal cyanides811 as well as recent popular oximationdehydration strategy12 with the prepared reagents13 or 
additional alkali1415 we designed an environmentally friendly alternative using triphosgene. This reagent is cheap 
and used without further preparation. In a recent report,16 the reaction site of oxime was used in the chemical detection of phosgene. Since then many 
researchers reported the synthesis of nitriles or amides from various oximes with phosgene or its substitutes 
(triphosgene and diphosgene). But most of these applications suffer from the effect of toxic phosgene overflow at 
alkaline conditions (such as adding TEA in the reaction system) and narrow substrate scope.
