Description:
Derivatives dehydrate to form imides and isoimides.

Text:
Imidic acid derivatives on dehydration under different conditions give 
corresponding imides and isoimides. A large number of applications of imides are known and 
plenty of methods to design them are well established.1,2 In comparison with imide, the isoimide 
chemistry is less explored and only limited isoimide chemistry is known.
