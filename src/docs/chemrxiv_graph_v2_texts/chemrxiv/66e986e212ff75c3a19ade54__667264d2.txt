Description:
Forms radicals that can be used in visible-light-mediated halogen atom transfer reactions.

Text:
This approach would provide 
a complementary strategy to most current visiblelight 
driven CF bond activation methods. Halogen atom transfer (XAT) is one example of a reaction 
that primarily depends on BDE.4547 Recent advancements 
in visiblelightmediated XAT have enabled the use of even 
unactivated alkyl chlorides as radical precursors, using var
ious radical species such as aaminoalkyl radicals,4853 silyl 
radicals,5467 ligated boryl radicals,6871 gterpinenyl
