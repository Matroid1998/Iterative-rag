Description:
A metal used in metal-air batteries.

Text:
Given its abundance, atmospheric molecular oxygen is an attractive 
oxidant for the generation of electricity from chemical fuels (such as H2 or methanol in fuel 
cells14 or metals like Zn, Fe, or Al in metalair batteries58) or for the distributed onsite 
electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide.9,10 In aqueous systems at room temperature, 
these separate applications require different selectivity in the terminal product of oxygen 
reduction, where generating hydrogen peroxide terminates at a net 2electron2proton 
reduction (hydrogen peroxide production reaction, HPPR O2  2H  2e  H2O2, E0  0.695 V 
vs. SHE) and fuel cell or metalair battery applications ideally reduce oxygen to water through a 
net 4electron4proton process (oxygen reduction reaction, ORR O2  4H  4e  2H2O, E0  
1.23 V vs. SHE).
