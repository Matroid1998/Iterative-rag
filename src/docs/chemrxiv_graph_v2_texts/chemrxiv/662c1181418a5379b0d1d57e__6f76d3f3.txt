Description:
Inhibits GABA degradation by inhibiting the enzyme GABA transaminase.

Text:
Increase in GABAergic activity is the basis for the mechanism of action of several anti
epileptic drugs (Macdonald and Kelly, 1993). For example, Clobazam, barbiturates such as
Phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines such as Diazepam are GABA receptor agonists, Tigabine
inhibits reuptake of GABA into the synaptic vescicles and increases the concentration of GABA in
the synaptic cleft, and Vigabatrin inhibits GABA degradation by inhibition of the enzyme GABA
transaminase (GABAT) (Czuczwar and Patsalos, 2001). The antiepileptic drugs Valproate and
Gabapentin are modulators of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) which catalyzes the
conversion of glutamate to GABA. Some of these antiepileptic drugs have multiple targets
(Macdonald and Kelly, 1993).

Description:
The only approved drug that targets GABA transaminase.

Text:
For example, Valproate targets Sodium channels for modulating the
membrane potential and Ttype Calcium channels for modulating neurotransmitter release
(Johannessen and Johannessen, 2003). And Gabapentine targets Calcium channels and increases
intracellular concentration of GABA (Czuczwar and Patsalos, 2001). Vigabatrin is the only
approved drug that targets GABA transaminase. However, Vigabatrin is associated with serious
adverse effects (Hawker and Silverman, 2012a). Therefore, GABAT, the validated molecular
target of Vigabatrin, was chosen as the target for the design of novel antiepileptic drugs in this
work. GABAT is also known as GABAamino transferase (GABAAT). Computer aided drug design can facilitate the rapid development of new drugs (Salman et al.,
2021), (Azad et al., 2023).
