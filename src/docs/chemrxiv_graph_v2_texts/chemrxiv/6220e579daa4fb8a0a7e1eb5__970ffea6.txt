Description:
A building block for terpenes, known as 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene.

Text:
Terpenes and their derivatives are a diverse 
family of biological molecules that provide a rich 
chemical space for finding renewable fuels with 
superior properties. Plants and microorganisms 
synthesize terpenes by combining units of isoprene 
(2methyl1,3butadiene). Products made from one 
isoprene (hemiterpenes; C5) are suitable as gasoline 
alternatives, while products from two isoprenes 
(monoterpenes; 
C10) 
and 
three 
isoprenes 
(sesquiterpenes; C15) can replace jet fuels and 
diesel fuels. Proposals for largescale production of 
terpenes include harvesting them from agricultural 
crops or from microorganisms growing in 
bioreactors 13. The compartmentalized nature of 
terpene biosynthesis provides opportunity to 
genetically engineer favored organisms such as 
Eucalyptus or E. coli to make any desired terpene, 
and to metabolically engineer yields that are beyond 
the natural baseline 4, 5.

Description:
A compound with a branched structure that causes terpenes to have methyl side chains.

Text:
The branched structure of 
isoprene causes most terpenes to have methyl side 
chains, which promotes favorable coldweather 
properties such as low melting points 6. The bio
synthesis process readily produces rings, including 
strained rings with carbon numbers as low as three, 
which gives terpenes high energy densities 6, 7. The biosynthesis process can also functionalize the 
terpenes by adding hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, 
ether bridges, etc. (These molecules are often 
termed terpenoids, but we will include them with 
terpenes.) For some applications, especially current 
aviation engines, oxygen and double bonds are not 
acceptable since they compromise energy density 
and storage stability; therefore terpenes must be 
hydrogenated to saturated hydrocarbons before they 
can be used as fuels 6.
