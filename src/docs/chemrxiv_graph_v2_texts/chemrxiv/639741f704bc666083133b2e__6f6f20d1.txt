Description:
Positioned for SNAr reactivity and regioselective attachment in the synthesis of adagrasib.

Text:
Commercial route development began with review and 
analysis of adagrasibs reported route (Figure 2).3 Iterative 
sidechain appendage to bicyclic pyrimidine core 2 resulted 
in a modular and convergent synthesis, and reparation 
required a longest linear sequence (LLS) of 8 synthetic step 
from available building blocks. Figure 2 Reported route to adagrasib, highlighting features to retain and revise. Synthesis commenced by forming a methanol adduct of 2 
at the northern aryl chlorides position. Blocking this site 
preserved SNAr reactivity at a later point in the synthesis 
and allowed regioselective prolinol attachment at the
