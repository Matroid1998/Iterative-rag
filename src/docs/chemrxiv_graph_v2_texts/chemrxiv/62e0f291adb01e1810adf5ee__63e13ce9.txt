Description:
Selectively couples with one of the primary amines formed upon deprotection of the DCP.

17 To this end, the authors 
optimized the formation of trans4,5diaminocyclopentenones 
(DCPs) from biomass derived furfural promoted by dysprosium 
trifluoromethanosulfonate under mild conditions,18 which have 
been further studied by several research groups (Figure 1B).19 
One DCP was used as diaminocyclopentane synthon through 
deprotection of the diallylamine group.17 Despite the concomi
tant reduction of reaction steps and increase in yield provided by 
the one step introduction of the two amines and formation of the 
carbocycle, a major challenge of this approach is the differentia
tion of the two primary amines formed upon deprotection of the 
DCP. The authors overcame this issue via a selective coupling 
of bromopyrrole lithium carboxylate and one of the primary 
amines. Figure 1.
