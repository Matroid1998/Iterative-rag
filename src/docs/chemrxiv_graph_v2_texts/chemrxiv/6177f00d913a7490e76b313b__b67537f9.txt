Description:
A nucleoside analogue first disclosed in the early 1960s.

A significant proportion of current chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer involve the use 
of antimetabolites, particularly modified nucleoside analogues that possess a capability to mimic 
native purine or pyrimidine nucleosides, which can disrupt metabolic and regulatory pathways.1 
Notwithstanding this significant medicinal capability, therapeutic intervention using nucleoside 
analogues is often limited by poor cellular uptake, low conversion to the active triphosphate 
metabolite, rapid degradation or clearance and development of resistance profiles in certain cell 
types.2 Consequently, research activity in this field continues to develop syntheses for next 
generations of nucleoside analogues that can overcome these limitations and provide new therapeutic 
options.35 
Within this context, 4thionucleosides, where the furanose ring oxygen is substituted with 
sulfur, have received attention from several academic and industrial groups since a first disclosure of 
4thioadenosine in the early 1960s;6,7 Figure 1 highlights some key achievements in this area.
