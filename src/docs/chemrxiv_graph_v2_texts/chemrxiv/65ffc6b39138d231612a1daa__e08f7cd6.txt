Description:
A ligand evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

Text:
Similarly, explicit solvent MD simulations revealed 
a 10  shift of the F169 side chain of p38 MAP kinase, exposing a cryptic pocket in the 
presence of BIRB 796  a novel ligand, later named doramapimod  which was evaluated by 
Boehringer Ingelheim in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases3. As it 
samples and explores different conformational states, molecular dynamics is particularly well 
suited to identifying cryptic pockets which remain occluded in many crystal structures4,5. While
raltegravir and doramapimod are excellent examples of molecular modeling and dynamics
