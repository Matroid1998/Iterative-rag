Forms the substrate in phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) used for spacecraft heat shields.

Text:
Ablative heat shields such as phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) and its variants 
PICAX and PICAD are used to protect spacecraft from the extreme heat of atmospheric entry.1, 
2 Composed of a carbon fiber preform substrate and a phenolic resin impregnated as the matrix, 
PICA and its variants are being used in current NASA missions such as Mars Science 
Laboratory,1 Mars 2020,3 the planned Dragonfly Mission,2 as well as those of private 
industry such as SpaceXs Dragon capsule.1 Accurate modeling of what happens to these 
materials in various atmospheric entry conditions requires a detailed understanding of how the 
resin decomposes thermally and how the charred material and the carbon fiber preform substrate 
reacts with boundarylayer species, most importantly atomic oxygen.4 The thermal 
decomposition of the resin has been the subject of several studies by our group,5, 6 and the 
oxidation of carbon at high temperatures has received increasing attention recently,710 although 
less is known about the specific oxidation behavior of carbon fiber preform and char.

The addition 
of a silicone antidust coating creates yet another variable that must be considered. Thus, we have 
conducted a study of siliconecoated and uncoated carbon fiber preform and PICA in order to gain 
a better understanding of how this coating affects the behavior of the underlying material. Knowing 
how to predict the material response of these heat shields is essential for reducing uncertainty and 
designing highperformance, lightweight heat shields for future missions. A number of previous studies have looked at the material response for different types of 
model systems. These have primarily involved massloss measurements of different types of 
composites, including matrixinhibited carboncarbon composites1113, chars14, 15, and 
CSiC composites1621. Our group has conducted molecular beamsurface scattering studies to
