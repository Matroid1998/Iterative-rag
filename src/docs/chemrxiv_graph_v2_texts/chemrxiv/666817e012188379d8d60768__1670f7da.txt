Description:
Involved in nickel-catalyzed cross coupling processes via oxidative addition through a radical mechanism.

Text:
Moreover, Doyle10a and Mei10b have successfully merged 
asymmetric nickel catalysis with photoredox catalysis or paired electrolysis to provide milder enantioselective reductive cross
coupling processes for the arylation of styrene oxides and chloroesters. It has been accepted that many of these Nicatalyzed 
crosscoupling processes of alkyl halides involve oxidative addition via a radical mechanism.
