Description:
A bond that can be cleaved at elevated temperatures or using light.

Text:
Cleavage of the peroxo bond at elevated temperatures or using 
light, also referred to as S2O82 activation,3,4 results in the formation of the sulfate radical anion 
(SO4), which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of  2.2 V vs. AgAgCl.5 The resulting SO4 
is capable of abstracting an electron or a hydrogen atom from molecules to form SO42 or HSO4, 
respectively.2 The ability of SO4 to abstract a hydrogen atom is leveraged frequently in organic 
synthesis for CH activation.68 For instance, McMillan and coworkers carried out arylation of 
ethers using photochemical reduction of S2O82.9 
Recently, we reported the selective oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding 
aldehydesketones (pH  7) and carboxylic acids (pH  7) via the electrocatalytic reduction of 
S2O82 to S2O83 using electrogenerated Ru(NH3)62.10 Our prior studies suggested an eightstep 
mechanism for the overall alcohol oxidation, with the first five steps, shown below as eqs.
