Description:
An amphiphilic spin probe widely used in EPR-based studies of LCST-type polymers.

Text:
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), optical 
transmission measurements, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are 
among the key techniques used to study thermal transitions in LCSTtype polymers. Continuous 
Wave (CW) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, as demonstrated in our 
studies on various thermoresponsive synthetic and bioinspired polymers, 23, 5, 1213 is 
particularly effective to predict and monitor pretransition temperatures. Utilizing EPR 
spectroscopy, one detects paramagnetic centers, such as persistent or shortlived organic 
radicals, or paramagnetic transition metal ions. Nitroxylbased compounds, particularly those 
derived from 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidine1oxyl (TEMPO), have proven to be of high use in 
soft matter research. Such, TEMPO itself has been widely used as an amphiphilic spin probe in 
EPRbased studies of LCSTtype polymers, by us and others.

Description:
Can dissolve to some extent in water, where it predominantly resides in hydrophilic regions of the sample.

Text:
With a high octanolwater 
partition coefficient of POW90, 14, 15 TEMPO can dissolve to some extent in water, where it 
predominantly resides in hydrophilic regions of the sample. However, it also sensitively detects 
more hydrophobic regions, such as the collapsed, waterdepleted areas of the polymer, as 
illustrated in Scheme 1. 5, 13, 1618
