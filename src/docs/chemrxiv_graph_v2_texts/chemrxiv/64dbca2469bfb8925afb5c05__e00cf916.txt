Description:
A Grignard reagent used to achieve sulfonation.

In this experiment, a different synthetic angle was
explored to create sulfanilamide which would be markedly more efficient and safe. This
method involves a Willis reagent which performs SO2 addition through a
O(tertButyl)Nsulfinylhydroxylamine (tBuONSO) intermediate that houses a relatively
stable aqueous thionyl intermediate.4 This eliminates the need to rely on SO2 gas
dissolved in water to nucleophilically attack the substrate, but directly substitutes the
thionyl group onto O(tertbutyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride to form the activate
sulfonation reagent tBuONSO. The next step utilizes a grignard reagent
(4Bis(trimethylsilyl)aminophenylmagnesium), which overall achieves the same effect
as a sulfonation. This further eliminates the need to protect the aniline with an
acetamide. Overall, this approach is drastically different from the standard reaction flow
to synthesize sulfanilamide1.
