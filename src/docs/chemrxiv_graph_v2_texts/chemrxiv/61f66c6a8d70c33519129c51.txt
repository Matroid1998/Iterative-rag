Description:
Photochromic compounds that uniquely combine ease of synthesis and bistability.

Text:
Molecular photoswitches12, molecules that undergo structural changes upon optical stimuli, enable 
scientists to remotely control the motion of molecules and to modulate their properties and functions. These compounds attract considerable attention, as they play significant roles in various fields ranging 
from nanotechnology to biology37, and their great potential has been shown in applications such as data 
storage89, drug delivery4, 7, 10, sensing1112, catalysis13, and energy conversion,14 etc. Over the past 
decades, various types of photoswitches have been developed and explored, including azobenzenes15, 
diarylethenes16, and spiropyrans17, and hydrazones11. Among these photochromic compounds, 
hydrazonebased switches18, which are a new addition to the molecular toolbox available to the 
community, uniquely combine ease of synthesis, bistability (thermal halflife as long as 5300 years19),
