Description:
Elemental sulfur is less selective and very susceptible to addition reactions with unsaturated functional groups.

through a facile 
multicomponent polymerization directly from elemental sulfur and 
primary diamines (Figure 1b).23, 2731 However, elemental sulfur is 
less selective and very susceptible to addition reactions with a 
large number of unsaturated functional groups,3234 resulting in a 
limited choice of substrates. Besides, due to the siteblocking 
effects of the condensation reactions, the synthesis of 
polythioamides via secondary diamines is rarely reported.29 
Herein, we report a new and general method for the synthesis of 
unprecedented polythioamides from CSF2, diboronic acids, and 
secondary diamines via a facile Nicatalyzed CF exchange 
process (Figure 1c). Diverse and welldefined structures, 
including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were 
realized. A DFT calculation indicates that the selfligation of CSF2 
can improve the selectivity of the reaction.
