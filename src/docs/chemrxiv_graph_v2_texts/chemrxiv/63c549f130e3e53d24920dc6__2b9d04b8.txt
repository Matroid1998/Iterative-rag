Description:
The plane can be distorted by local vibrational fluctuations, affecting the carbonyl bond.

So far, the current observations indicate that nonaromatic fluorescence is pre
53
ceded by a nearvisible absorption associated to two alternative electronic transi
54
tions (i) the n transitions localized in the carbonyl bonds, which can be shifted
55
towards the visible range when local vibrational fluctuations distort the amide plane
56
and elongate the carbonyl bond (CO) distance,14 and (ii) charge transfer transi
57
tions followed by charge recombination have been also identified as a possible source
58
for the UVvis absorption.15, 16 In addition, the role of hydrogen bonds (HBs)
59
between CO and peptide NH groups causing electron delocalization and enabling
60
lower transition energies as well as higher radiative relaxation efficiency, was first
61
suggested17, 18 and confirmed later on.19, 7, 12
62
The fate of nonaromatic molecules on excited states and how they can possibly
63
get trapped leading to emission of visible light, remains an open challenge.
