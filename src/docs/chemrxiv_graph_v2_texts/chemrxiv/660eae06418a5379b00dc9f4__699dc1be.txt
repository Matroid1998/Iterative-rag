Description:
Forms host-guest complexes with cyclodextrins due to their nonpolar nature and suitable size.

Text:
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are capable of forming hostguest complexes with various guest 
molecules, such as adamantane, azobenzene or fullerenes.1 The hydrophobic effect allows 
nonpolar molecules with fitting size and geometry to be included into their cavity.2 Such 
noncovalent complexes have numerous uses, for instance, in the development of 
supramolecular systems applied in drug delivery systems3 or food chemistry4. In particular, 
combining the hostguest interaction with polymers is exploited in many applications.5,6 The 
creation of stimulusresponsive polymer materials with diverse applications can be achieved
