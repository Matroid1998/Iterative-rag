Description:
A species with an electronic structure resembling that of a complex with a combined number of valence electrons in the Fe 3d and NO orbitals.

This inherent instabil
26
ity has hindered a detailed study of the brown ring test, though recent attempts have given
27
invaluable insights into the electronic structure and instability of the complex 4. Wanat
28
and coworkers have studied the kinetic and spectroscopic aspects of the reversible reaction
29
of NO with Fe(H2O)62 to give the brown ring complex 4. Their study also indicated
30
the presence of a S32 (quartet) species using EPR, which also also the presence of a
31
complex with an electronic structure resembling that of a FeNO7 species, following the
32
EnemarkFeltham notation 5. The superscript in FeNO7 denotes the combined number
33
of valence electrons in the Fe 3d and NO() orbitals.

Description:
A species with a high spin FeIII center antiferromagnetically coupled with a NO(S1) moiety.

ment with EPR study also indicated the presence of a FeNO7 species with a high spin
35
FeIII center antiferromagnetically coupled with a NO(S1) moiety. Eventually Monsch
36
and coworkers reported the crystal data for the Fe(H2O)5(NO)2 complex in their recent
37
study 6. The crystal could be isolated due the use of bulky gallate counter ion having
38
peruoropinacolato ligands. The XRD established the theoretically predicted octahedral
39
structure of the complex with an axial NO ligand.
