Description:
Absorbed at the ocean-air interface, where about one third of anthropogenically generated CO2 is taken up.

Text:
The gasliquid interface is a ubiquitous chemical environment in nature. It plays a major role in 
industrial processes, atmospheric chemistry, and environmental science. Examples include airfuel mixing 
in internal combustion engines,1 acid rain formation,24 tropospheric aerosol surface chemistry, 5 and the 
uptake of CO2 at the oceanair interface, where about one third of anthropogenically generated CO2 is 
absorbed.6 It is thus desirable to develop a molecularscale understanding of chemistry at the gasliquid 
interface.
