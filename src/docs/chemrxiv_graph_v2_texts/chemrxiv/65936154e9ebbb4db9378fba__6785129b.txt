Description:
Vibrational probes whose VSE facilitates the measurement of the electric field projected along the CN bond axis.

Text:
Vibrational Stark effect (VSE) spectroscopy 
interprets changes in the absorption of molecular vibrations 
through the inluence of the local environmental electric 
ield4 and therefore provides a direct comparison with the 
output of simulations. Nitriles (CN) are popular 
vibrational 
probes1822 
whose 
VSE 
facilitates 
the 
measurement of the electric ield projected along the CN 
bond axis, FCN,23 and, as such, enables the quantiication of 
the strength of noncovalent interactions using an 
electrostatic scale.

Description:
Frequencies can be evaluated within the framework of the VSE in aprotic environments.

Text:
Previous work demonstrated that nitrile 
frequencies of small molecules observed in aprotic 
solvation environments have a linear correlation with 
nitrile electric ields obtained from ixedcharge (FC) and 
polarizable (POL) MD simulations (called FCN,FC MD and 
FCN,POL MD, respectively).4,24 This indicates that nitrile 
frequencies in aprotic environments can be evaluated 
within the framework of the VSE, and electric ield
frequency calibrations enable the extraction of an electric 
ield when a frequency is measured in a new environment, 
herein termed FCN,FC FREQ or FCN,POL FREQ depending on the FF 
used for calibration. Many studies attempted to extract 
FCN,FREQs for nitriles in protic solvents25,26 and more 
complex Hbonding environments in proteins (where 
nitriles were introduced via ligands and noncanonical or 
modiied amino acids)18,2730 for direct comparisons with 
FCN,MDs in these environments.
