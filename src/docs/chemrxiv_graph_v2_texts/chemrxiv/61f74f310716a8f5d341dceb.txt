Description:
Forms thermodynamically favorable interactions with low-valent, d-electron-rich metals through strong metal-to-CO backdonation.

Text:
of low (or zero) valent, delectronrich metals, as such metals 
35 
can form thermodynamically favorable metalCO interactions through their stronger metaltoCO 
backdonation compared to highervalent metals (21,22). However, the strong interaction 
between lowvalent metals and CO greatly affects the desorption efficiency. In fact, the reversible 
chemisorption of CO with zerovalent transition metals has been achieved under the extreme 
conditions used in the Mond process (vide supra). Thus, hitherto reported adsorption technologies 
40 
have predominantly relied on the chemisorption of CO by highervalent metals to minimize the 
influence of metaltoCO backdonation. Temperatureswing operations, i.e., the use of a higher 
operation temperature during CO desorption than during CO adsorption, are frequently applied, 
and desorption is often carried out under reduced pressure (pressureswing operation) 
(6,8,9,12,13,15).
