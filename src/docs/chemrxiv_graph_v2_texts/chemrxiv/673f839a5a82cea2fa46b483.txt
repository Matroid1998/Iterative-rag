Description:
A greenhouse gas that remains in the atmosphere longer than methane.

Text:
The production of natural gas (NG) in the US increased by 4, 5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), in 2023 
compared to the production in 2022 1. Natural gas consists of between 70 and 90  methane (CH4) 2, 
one of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although CH4 stays in the atmosphere for a 
shorter period than CO2 3, it has a global warming potential that is 27  30 times higher than CO2 in a 
100year timespan 4, 5, 6. Methane is emitted from natural sources, such as wetlands, and 
anthropogenic sources, such as energy production and agricultural activities 7. Globally, emissions from the energy sector accounted for approximately 130 million tonnes of CH4 in 
2023 8.
