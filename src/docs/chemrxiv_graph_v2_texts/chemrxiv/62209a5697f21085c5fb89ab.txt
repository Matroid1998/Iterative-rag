Description:
A chromophore that converts photon energy into vibrational energy in the vision mechanism.

Text:
Any excess of vibrational energy in a molecule above its zeropoint level may induce 
physicalchemical reactions like isomerization, dissociation, or rearrangement. The role of such 
vibrational energy excess is particularly relevant when a lightexcited molecule transfers the 
photon energy to the ground state without emitting radiation. The classic example is the vision 
mechanism, where a complex sequence of events is triggered in the rhodopsin protein after the 
retinal chromophore converts photon into vibrational energy.1 
We often say that a molecule with large vibrational energy is hot. However, if we ask what 
the molecules temperature is, the question sounds odd.
