Description:
A material alternative used in the preparation of MPs.

Text:
To expand the 
material alternatives to PLGA, MPs have been prepared from poly(caprolactone) 15, 
methacrylates 16, hydrogels 17, naturallysourced polymers 18, and silica 19. Our group 
has explored polyesters functionalized with pendant olefinic groups which can be UV irradiated 
to prepare crosslinked polyester MPs (xMP) 20,21.
