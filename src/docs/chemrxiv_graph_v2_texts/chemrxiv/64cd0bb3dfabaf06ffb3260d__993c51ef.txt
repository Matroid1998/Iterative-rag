Description:
A sequence that can be installed using urea.

Besides, the above
mentioned isosteric replacement also was used in more sophisticated structures including cyclic ones 
(Figure 1, A) 7. Among these compounds, some examples bear NS(O)2N sequence instead of 
NC(O)N ones. Logically, we can explore classical reactions in which urea is used for the NC(O)N 
installation for the replacement of the latter to (H2NSO2NH2). Moreover, such examples of using 
H2NSO2NH2 as 1,3binucleophile is already existing 8. Thus, it was a great surprise for us, that the 
simple switch from urea to sulfamide in the classical wellknown multicomponent reaction, like 
Biginelli 9, was unknown for today (Figure 1, B). Since Monastrols discovery in 1999 10 three
component Biginelli condensation became one of the most widespread reactions in MedChem 
utilizing urea derivatives 11.
