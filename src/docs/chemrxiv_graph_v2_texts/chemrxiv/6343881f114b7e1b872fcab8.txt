Description:
Axially chiral compounds whose dihedral angles influence reactivity and enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis.

Text:
of substituents with bigger steric hindrance at 6, 6positions leads to 
bigger dihedral angles. Interestingly, introduction of halos at 5, 5positions makes dihedral angles 
of the axially chiral biphenyldiols become smaller. It is well known that the dihedral angles for the 
axially chiral ligands and catalysts are a key factor for reactivity of substrates and 
enantioselectivity of products in asymmetric synthesis.
