Since the identification of the first antimicrobial peptide (AMP), cecropin, from silk 
moths (Hyalophora cecropia) in the early 1980s, approximately 2000 AMPs, have been 
isolated from various biological sources from insects to humans.57 The unique therapeutic 
features of AMPs, such as nonspecific mode of action and broadspectrum activity, have 
attracted the attention of many research groups around the world.8, 9 Many reports have 
proposed that AMPs exert their action by binding to the cell membrane, causing cell death by 
direct membrane disruption or translocation into the cytosol where potential internal targets are 
aected.911 AMPs are known to exert microbial killing via a unique, multifaceted mode of 
action, which makes it very difficult for pathogens to develop resistance against them.12 In 
addition, the different mode of action of AMPs compared to the conventional antibiotics, which 
specically target cellular components at various levels, explains their broad spectrum of 
activity, including against drugresistant pathogens.1315 Consequently, extensive efforts have 
been made to develop AMPs as novel antimicrobial agents.1618 In addition to the native lipo 
and glycopeptide antibiotics such as daptomycin, polymyxin B, and vancomycin, which are 
already available on the market, many synthetic AMPs are still in the drug development phase, 
yet to reach clinical application.1820 Despite being recognized as a promising class of 
molecules for many years, AMPs have not made a substantial impact in the treatment of 
infections caused by resistant bacteria and fungi.
