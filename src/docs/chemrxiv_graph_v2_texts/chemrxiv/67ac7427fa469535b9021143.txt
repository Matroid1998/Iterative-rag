Molecules found in many commercially successful drugs.

Text:
It is a wellknown phenomenon in drug discovery that many bioactive compounds share 
the same scabold1,2. Among these privileged groups, bicyclic Nheterocycles such as 
benzimidazoles, benzoxazoles, and (tetrahydro)isoquinolines are overrepresented, 
making them very important targets for synthetic strategies. Consequently, many of these 
privileged groups have already been accessed via biocatalytic routes, which are often 
discussed in the context of sustainable synthesis36. However, enzymatic routes have not 
been described for all Nheterocyclic groups, such as in the case of indazoles. These 
molecules are found in many commercially successful drugs, such as granisetron, 
axitinib, niraparib and pazopanib, which are used to treat nausea and cancer (Figure 1A). The 1Hand 2Htautomers of indazoles are equally important for drug development.

Description:
In the case of indazoles without N-substitutions, the 1H tautomer dominates because it is more stable.
