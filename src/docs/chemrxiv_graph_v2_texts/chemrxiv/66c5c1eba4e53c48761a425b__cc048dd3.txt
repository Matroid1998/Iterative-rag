Description:
A 65 wt% aqueous solution with 99% purity used in the preparation of SilverSil coatings.

Text:
Besides we investigate the preparation of new SilverSil coatings in the presence or 
without added AgNO3 as well as the effect of selected parameters including the 
wateralkoxide ratio, the absence of ethanol as a cosolvent, the time of gel aging, 
and the alcogelhydrogel drying conditions. Results are revealing and further support 
the investigation of SilverSil towards practical application as antibacterial coatings of 
broadscope and limited antimicrobial resistance. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 Reagents 
TEOS (purity grade 99), MTES (purity grade 99), APTMS (99 pure), NaBH4 
(purity grade 96), aqueous nitric acid (65 wt, purity grade 99), aqueous 
ammonia (25 wt), and AgNO3 (99.9 pure) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MI, USA). All chemicals were of high purity and were used without any 
further purification.
