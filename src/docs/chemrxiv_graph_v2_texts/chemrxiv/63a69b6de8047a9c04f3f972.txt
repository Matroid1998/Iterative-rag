A two-dimensional nanomaterial with fascinating physical properties.

Text:
Since the discovery of graphene with fascinating physical properties, the research 
on twodimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as 2D monoelemental materials, metal 
chalcogenides, perovskites, etc., has flourished.113 Among them, 2D monoelemental 
crystals have attracted a lot of attention due to exotic electronic properties and 
transport behaviors.8,9,1416 2D monoelemental crystals possess a honeycomb lattice 
structure similar to that of graphene but with different degrees of outofplane 
buckling.

Description:
A 2D monoelemental crystal from group IVA materials, important for accessing topological insulator states.

Text:
A typical class of 2D monoelemental crystal is groupIVA materials, 
including graphene, silicene, germanene and stanene, most of which are important 
candidates for accessing topological insulator states.9,1719 Besides, subsequently 
found borophene exhibits metallic characteristics with highly anisotropic electronic 
properties, further enriching the 2D monoelement family.14 Another important group 
of 2D monoelemental crystals is GroupVA 2D materials, recently exhibiting 
remarkable development potential in the semiconductor device and arousing 
widespread interest.15,2024 For example, black phosphorene, the most investigated
