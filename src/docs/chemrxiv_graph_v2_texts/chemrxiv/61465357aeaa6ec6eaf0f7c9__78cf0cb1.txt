Description:
A compound whose anatase phase stability is maintained by Ta doping at high temperatures.

Text:
Importantly, we find that Ta 
doping preserved the anatase content of TiO2 up to annealing temperatures of 850 C which 
allows anatase stability to be maintained at typical ceramic processing temperatures. The 
substitution of Ti4 by the Ta5 ions increased the electron concentration in the crystal lattice 
through formation of Ti3 defect states. Raman studies revealed the formation of new Ta bonds 
via disturbing the TiOTi bonds in the crystal lattice. It is concluded that under the oxidising 
conditions, Ta5 ions could be enhanced on TaTiO2 surface due to the slow diffusion kinetics. Keywords Anatase; Defects; Dopant; Titanium dioxide; Oxygen vacancy
