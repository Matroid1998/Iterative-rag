Description:
A component of the stator in the described molecular motor, involved in the structural transformation during the motor's operation.

Text:
If one views the motor, in the stereochemistry shown, along the central bond, from the rotor to the
stator, the rotor turns clockwise relative to the stator. In the rst step, the central double bond
undergoes ZE photoisomerization, converting the stable form (A) to the metastable form (B). In the
second step, thermal helix inversion (THI) converts B to another stable form (C). Here, the change in
stator pucker from B to C resembles a ap of buttery wings, putting the stator benzene rings from
the back to the front. Another, similar, 180rotation then converts C to A via D. Because the motors
shown here have symmetric stators, A and C have identical energy, as do B and D. In contrast, A and
