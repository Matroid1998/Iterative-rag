Description:
An element used to alloy with iridium in catalyst powders.

Text:
This decreased catalyst utilization comes along with significant performance losses.1012 
To overcome the problems associated with too thin catalyst layers, the iridium content in the catalyst powder should be decreased to enable 
the fabrication of sufficiently thick catalyst layers with low iridium loadings. In other words, advanced electrode architectures require a high 
electrode thickness factor, which per definition is the electrode thickness as a function of catalyst loading. 1,8,13 
Common strategies to reduce the iridium content in the catalyst powder are either to alloy iridium with more abundant elements or to 
support the iridium. Alloying has been shown with many different elements, such as Fe14, Cr15, and Ni14,16.
