Description:
Hierarchically porous materials prepared with good control on texture and particle size using the Steam Assisted Crystallisation method.

Text:
The Steam Assisted Crystallisation (SAC) 
method, also called Dry Gel Conversion (DGC), has 
become a popular procedure to prepare hierarchically 
porous zeolites with a good control on texture and 
particle size 2832. In this method, an amorphous 
(mixed) oxide is prepared in the form of a dry gel and 
treated under hydrothermal conditions in the presence 
of a structuredirecting agent and of steam. Upon 
steaming, the crystallization of the zeolite proceeds via 
an oriented attachment route, which consists in the 
aggregation and alignment of tiny crystallites that form 
bigger crystals 29. This technique therefore differs 
from the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites, the latter 
involving the crystallization route by nucleation and 
growth in liquid phase water.
