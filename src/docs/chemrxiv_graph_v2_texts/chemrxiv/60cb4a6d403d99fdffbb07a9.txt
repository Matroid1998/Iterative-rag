Coordination polymers are polymeric arrays of monomeric units that are held together through metal 
18 
coordination (Yang et al., 2015). These materials continue to attract attention due to their use in a 
19 
wide range of applications from medicine (Medici et al., 2016), to catalysis (Zeng et al., 2016), 
20 
sensors (Yi et al., 2016) and luminescent materials (Yersin et al., 2017) (To et al., 2020). Among the 
21 
metals used to synthesize coordination polymers, silver is of particular interest due to the range of 
22 
geometries and coordination modes available (Young and Hanton, 2008).

Description:
Forms coordination polymers with 1D, 2D, and 3D networks.

Text:
Silver has been 
23 
demonstrated to form coordination polymers with a range of morphologies, 1D, 2D and 3D 
24 
coordination networks have been demonstrated for a range of ligands (Carlucci et al., 1995) (Chen et 
25 
al., 2006) (Roy et al., 2016). 26 
Luminescent coordination polymers containing silver(I) were first documented in 1999 (Tong et al., 
27 
1999) with the report of a selfassembled 3D coordination polymer of silver(I) with bisphenol Schiff 
28 
base ligands that showed bright blue emission in both the solid state and in solution. Since then, 
29 
many luminescent silver coordination polymers have been reported. Macrocycles and 2D structures 
30 
made of Ag(I) and pyrimidinebased thioether ligands, reported by Han and coworkers (Han et al., 
31 
2005), also show bright luminescence.
