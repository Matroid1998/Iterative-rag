Description:
Ions used in coordination chemistry to generate chiral monomeric and polymeric systems.

Text:
The coordination chemistry toolbox consisting of combining 
sophisticated chiral conjugated ligands with lanthanide ions 
constitutes a very fruitful strategy for generating chiral monomeric 
and polymeric systems.

Description:
Elements known for their strong magnetic anisotropy and finely structured emission.

In such systems, a precise chiral topology 
and multifunctionality can be designed and achieved from the 
synergy of the chiral ligand properties and the specific optical and 
magnetic features of the lanthanide ion.13 Furthermore, this 
strategy unravels fascinating cross effects originating from the 
combination of chirality with optical, conducting or magnetic 
properties, such as ferroelectricity, chiral singlemolecular magnet 
(SMM)

interest in combining the inherent characteristics of lanthanides, 
especially strong magnetic anisotropy and finely structured 
emission, with chiral features within the same architecture.
