Central to sustaining the Earth's human carrying capacity through industrial production.

Additionally, as of 2020 most (98) hydrogen is produced for chemical, non
energetic purposes such as ammonia production and oil refinement.4 It is well known that industrial 
ammonia production is central to sustaining the Earths human carrying capacity; this underscores the 
importance of developing renewable hydrogen production avenues. In this paper, we refer to the 
integration of renewable hydrogen into the global energy system as the green hydrogen economy (GHE) 
and explore research trends in each of the three facets of the green hydrogen economy green hydrogen 
production, hydrogen storage, and hydrogenbased fuel cells.
