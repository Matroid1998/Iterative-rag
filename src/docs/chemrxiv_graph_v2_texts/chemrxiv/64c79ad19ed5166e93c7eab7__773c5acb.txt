Description:
An oxidation product of TCNQ.

Melamineformaldehyde resins are widely used in a variety of plastic
products such as kitchenwares as well as coating. Neutral melamine, e.g. melamine in water,
is colorless and absorbs ultraviolet light 1112 and uoresces ultraviolet light 1314. It is
therefore a perfect host that is transparent in the visible range. Doped melamine single crystals are synthesised by mixing an aqueous solution of melamine
and a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of TCNQ, followed by crystallisation by vaporization
at room temperature. The doping level is tuned by varing the molar ratio of melamine
and TCNQ in the aqueous THF. Mass spectrometry combined with UVVis spectroscopy
elucidates that the dopants are TCNQ and dicyanoptoluoyl cyanide (DCTC), an oxidation
product of TCNQ.
