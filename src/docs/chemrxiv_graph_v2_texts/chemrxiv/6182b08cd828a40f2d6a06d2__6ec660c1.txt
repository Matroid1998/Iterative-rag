Description:
A large polymer that does not mix ideally with lipids at low compositions.

Text:
Early work on the properties hybrid PBdPEO giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) 
investigated the large PBd46PEO30 polymer mixed with POPC.13, 14 Mixing between these 
components was not ideal at low lipid composition, where it was assumed that a high energy cost for 
insertion of these larger polymers into a thin lipid membrane frustrated hybrid vesicle formation, and 
no GUVs were observed at intermediate compositions.13 The GUV membranes that were formed in 
this study were, however, homogeneous, but biotinylation of either the lipid or polymer and cross
linking by addition of the multivalent neutravidin protein did result in microscopic domain formation.
