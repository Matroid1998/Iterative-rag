Description:
A molecule with inherent stability, requiring about 750 kJ/mol to break the CO bond.

One of the directions for tackling global warming
25
and our dependency on fossil fuels is to convert the emitted CO2 in the socalled highvalue products, a process named
26
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Over the past years, the scientific community has devoted considerable attention to this
27
area, leading to a wealth of published articles that explore diverse materials and methodologies aimed at establishing a
28
closed CO2 cycle710. Figure 1 (yellow) depicts the rising trend in works regarding CO2 and CO reduction reaction as
29
topic. 30
One of the greatest challenges in CO2RR is the inherent stability of carbon dioxide molecules. The energy required to
31
break the CO bond is about 750 kJmol, about twice the value for forming CH, CC, and CO bonds7,11.
