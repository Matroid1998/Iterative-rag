Description:
Doubly prefunctionalized precursors that are less readily available for generating dilithium species.

Text:
In light of the paramount importance of organolithium species, organodilithium 
species that have two carbonlithium bonds in a single molecule should be fascinating, 
especially in the construction of cyclic frameworks.2 However, the generation of such 
dilithium species often encounters difficulty (Scheme 1) A) doubly prefunctionalized 
precursors, mostly dihalides, are much less readily available; B) the second lithiation is more 
difficult than the first one and unwanted intramolecular reductive CCbond formation can thus 
precede the second lithiation; C) the dilithiated species generated under harsher conditions are 
thus unstable and highly reactive, which limits the variety of useful dilithium species. Scheme 1. Difficulty in generating dilithium species.
