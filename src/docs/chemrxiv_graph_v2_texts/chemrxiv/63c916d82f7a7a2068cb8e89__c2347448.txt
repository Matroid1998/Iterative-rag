Description:
Forms nonclassical complexes with some extent of HH bonding preserved.

Text:
Strong orbital interactions result 
in oxidative addition, fully cleaving the HH bond to form a metal dihydride (Figure 1, b).3,4,68 In 
contrast, weaker interactions result in nonclassical dihydrogen complexes, in which some extent 
of HH bonding is preserved.810 
Activation of molecular H2 with 3d metals is generally more challenging than with 4d or 5d metals 
because they tend to form weaker MH bonds.
