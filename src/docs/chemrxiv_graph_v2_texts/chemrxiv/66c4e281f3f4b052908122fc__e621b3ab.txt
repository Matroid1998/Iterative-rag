Description:
Used for metabolic labeling in cellulo to track RNA molecules within biological systems.

The field of therapeutic RNA has gained significant attention due to its potential in revolutionizing 
the treatment of genetic disorders, cancer, and infectious diseases13. Central to the development 
of RNAbased therapeutics is in vitro transcription, which produces the desired synthetic RNA3 
and allows for the incorporation of modified nucleotides3. Modifications of RNA are employed to 
their stability and efficacy as therapeutic agents4. Besides, metabolic labeling in cellulo of RNA 
through the addition of modified nucleotide triphosphates is widely used for tracking RNA 
molecules within biological systems4. The ability to introduce specific modified nucleotides into 
RNA strands can provide insights into RNA metabolism and function, underscoring the 
importance of modified RNA labeling techniques4.
