Description:
A nontoxic, thermally stable gas with excellent dielectric properties, commonly used in high-voltage systems and the semiconductor industry.

Text:
The excellent dielectric properties of SF6, in
conjunction with it being a nontoxic, thermally stable as well as the higher density than air, has 
made it a commonly used gas in many electrical systems, such as highvoltage systems and 
circuit breakers as well as in the semiconductor industry 3. Various methods have been 
employed to reduce the emission of SF6 ranging from 1) disposal methods such as incineration,
