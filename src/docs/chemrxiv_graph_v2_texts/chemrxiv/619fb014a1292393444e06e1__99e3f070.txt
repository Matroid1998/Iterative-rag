Description:
Used in hydrofluorination to introduce fluorine atoms into organic molecules.

Text:
Hydrofluorination is an essential method in synthesis. The addition of HF to unsaturated functional 
groups serves as an atomefficient and expedient way to introduce fluorine atoms into organic 
molecules.110 Such substitutions are highly attractive for drug discovery and agrochemical sciences 
where the introduction of fluorine is known to block metabolic pathways, improve lipophilicity, modify 
pKa of adjacent sites, and improve binding through noncovalent interactions.11,12 

Hydrofluorination methods are not without their technical challenges.
