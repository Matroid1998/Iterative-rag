Description:
A compound whose reduction is proposed to be the rate determining step for producing carbon-coupled products.

Text:
As yet it is not possible to reliably tune the downstream C2 products produced, such as 
ethylene and ethanol, and the mechanisms defining such selectivities are not firmly established (Scheme 1).5 Even 
on a planar catalyst, perhaps the simplest practical system for mechanistic studies, there are many effects to consider, 
including, but not limited to concentration polarization effects from dissolved CO2, intermediates, electrolytes, 
fluctuations in local pH, and the faceting and restructuring of the electrode surface.6

Scheme 1 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO requires two proton and electron transfers. Reduction of CO is proposed to be the rate
determining step for producing carboncoupled products, but the exact species it is reduced to upon dimerization are still under 
investigation.5
