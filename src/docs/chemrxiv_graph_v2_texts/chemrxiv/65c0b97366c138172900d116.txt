Description:
A chiral molecule studied using ab initio and classical MD simulations.

Text:
The analysis of IR spectra based on the identication
of eective modes 15 has been previously applied to a
variety of molecular systems 1722 where diverse MD
techniques were employed to generate the trajectories. In
the present work, we focus on the IR spectroscopy of the
alanine amino acid 2327, a chiral molecule that some
of the authors have recently studied based on ab initio
and classical MD simulations in dierent phases 5. The
eective modes analysis is used here to (i) identify the
spectral signatures of neutral and zwitterionic alanine in
the gas phase in the region 10002000 cm1 as well as to
