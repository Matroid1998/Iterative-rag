Description:
Detected as intermediates in the formation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons.

Text:
Carbon chains are onedimensional linear molecules of the generic formula 
R(CC)nR connected by sphybridized carbon atoms. The Hcapped ones, 
H(CC)nH, is the simplest form of a variety of endsubstituted carbon chains. They 
are sometimes referred to as polyacetylenes in the literature, which is an error because 
the polymer with the formula (HCCH)n actually is polyacetylene, while the exact 
name of H(CC)nH should be polyyne. Early exploration found that Hcapped carbon chains are of relevance in the 
chemistry of dense interstellar clouds and these highly unsaturated polymers 
contribute significantly to the astrochemical evolution of the interstellar medium 1. Moreover, they are also detected as intermediates in the formation of polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons and fullerenes 2.
