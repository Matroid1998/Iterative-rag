Description:
Found in posttreated desalinated water at much lower concentrations than recommended by public health authorities for drinking water.

Text:
The median iodine 
concentrations for four groups of tap water samples ranged from 0.3 to 12.3 gL, which is 
lower than the concentrations previously reported by other researchers in Israel. Based on 
typical consumption, the water samples can provide no more than 3.39 of the recommended 
dietary allowance level for iodine. The analysis of posttreated desalinated water samples 
indicated that these waters comply with industrial specifications but contain only trace 
concentrations of iodine and much less magnesium than recommended by different public 
health authorities for public consumption of drinking water. Conclusion The total iodine concentrations found were lower than several 
observations reported in previous years in the literature. There are currently no strict
