Description:
Functions as an optical cycling center in molecules, enabling laser cooling by scattering photons with minimal population loss.

Text:
The CaO group attached to a molecular scaffold can function as an optical cycling center
(OCC). Molecules functionalized with OCCs can be lasercooled by scattering thousands of
photons with a minimal loss of the population from the cycling pair of states (preferrably,
the ground state and the lowest excited state). Lasercooled molecules are exploited in quan
tum technologies as well as in studies of fundamental physical phenomena116 and ultracold
chemistry1729. The idea of using OCCs in polyatomic molecules builds on the success of
lasercooling of diatomic molecules3042. The electronic structure of lasercooled molecules
(all the way through hyperfine structure), their applications, and recent experimental ad
vances are thoroughly covered in recent reviews4349.

Description:
Functions as an OCC by providing access to an electronically excited state that decays to the ground state.

Text:
The CaO group can function as an OCC because it supplies the molecule with an access to
an electronically excited state that spontaneously decays almost exclusively to the molecular
(electronic and vibrational) ground state5057. Other quantum functional groups suitable for
laser cooling, such as SrO and YbO, have also been identified5787. FIG. 1

groups, such as CaO OCCs, for precise optical sensing of chemical events.
