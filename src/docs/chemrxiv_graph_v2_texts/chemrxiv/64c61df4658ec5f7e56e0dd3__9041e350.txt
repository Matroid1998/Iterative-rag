Description:
A heterocyclic system valuable for medicinal chemistry and part of an FDA approved HIV entry inhibitor.

Text:
A heterocyclic system of 1Hpyrrolo2,3cpyridine, which is also named 6azaindole, is a 
valuable object for medicinal chemistry. This core is not represented in nature as is. Still, its 
benzofused analogue carboline is a wellknown scaffold for the plenty of natural compounds 
(787 structures are presented in the Reaxys database). Recently representatives of another 
benzofused system, 3Hpyrrolo2,3cquinoline have been found in natural objects, e.g. antiplasmodial alkaloid Aplidiopsamine A 1 and antifungal Pyonitrin family 2 (Figure 1, A). However, 6azaindole heterocyclic system has brought an FDA approved HIV entry inhibitor 
Fostemsavir 3.

Description:
A scaffold used in compounds for treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases via inhibition of signaling pathways through Toll-like receptors.

Text:
In 2009 this system was also found by GSK scientists as a template for the 
construction of potassium competitive acid blockers (pCABs) 4, which led to the developing by 
Yuhan Research Institute 5 a promising drug candidate YH4808 against reflux esophagitis having 
achieved Phase 2 of clinical trials 6. Furthermore, Bristol Myers Squibb has recently developed 
a promising compound incorporating a 6azaindole scaffold for treating inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases via inhibition of signaling pathways through Tolllike receptors 7, 8, or 9 7 
(Figure 2, B). All the mentioned indicate a growing need for efficient synthetic approaches to 
MedChem relevant building blocks comprising the 6azaindole core. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023qk7sx ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000342818268 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
