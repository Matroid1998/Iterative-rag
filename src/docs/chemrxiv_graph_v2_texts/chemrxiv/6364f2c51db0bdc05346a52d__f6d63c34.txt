Description:
Compounds formed by reacting defective regions with peripheral metal cations.

Text:
79 The defective region can 
react with peripheral metal cations forming a new class of compounds known as transitionmetal
substituted polyoxotungstates, M(L)XW11O39q (X  e.g. P(V), Si(IV), L  H2O, DMSO, etc.). Lacunary polytungstates behave as an inert, pentadentate ligands containing five 2bridging 
oxoligands. Conventionally, hexacoordinate heteroatoms are incorporated into polytungstates so the 
sixth coordination site are occupied by solvent ligands from the local environment. These structures 
have attracted significant interest as single atom catalysts (SACs) in fields including but not limited to 
(i) water splitting; (ii) carbon dioxide reduction; and nitrogen reduction.10
