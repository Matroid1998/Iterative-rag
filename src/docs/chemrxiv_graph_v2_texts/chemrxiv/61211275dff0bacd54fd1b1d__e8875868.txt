Light harvesting chromophores that exhibit desirable excitonic properties for application in photocatalysis.

Text:
Nanographenes, such as graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and nanoribbons (GNRs), are light
harvesting chromophores that exhibit desirable excitonic properties for application in 
photocatalysis. The relative size of GQDs and GNRs constrain their excitons to a size that is 
smaller than the essentially infinitely large exciton Bohr radius of bulk graphene. Consequentially, excitons in these systems are quantumconfined, enabling size tunable energy 
gaps.1 Sizedependent tunability of the energy gap has been shown both theoretically2 and 
experimentally,3 demonstrating the versatility of lightharvesting in nanographenes.

Description:
Computational results confirm the sextet rule when comparing armchair and zigzagedged nanographenes.

For example, 
triangular GQDs of varying size exhibit a progressive redshift of their ultranarrow absorption 
and emission bands with increasing size.3 Nanographene sizeshape can also be utilized to tune 
their optical properties (and chemical stability) and is best described by the chemically intuitive 
Clars sextet rule of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which states that the more aromatic 
sextets (that is, the more benzenelike subunits) in the molecule, the larger the optical gap and 
higher the stability.4 Computational results confirm the sextet rule when comparing armchair 
and zigzagedged nanographenes.

Structures that can be selectively modified using Diels-Alder or CH activation chemistry to study their electronic and optical properties.

The 
aromatization of these soluble polyphenylenes is achieved using oxidative 
cyclodehydrogenation to form insoluble nanographene products.18 More recently, oneshot 
annotative extension has been developed as a useful growth from template method to 
selectively modify K, L and bayregions of nanographenes using DielsAlder or CH activation 
chemistry.19,20 These synthetic tools have enabled numerous studies on the effect of 
nanographene size, shape and heteroatoms on the electronic and optical properties of well
defined carbon materials.21,22 
Only a limited number of studies report the optical properties of GNRs.14,2334 Using wet 
chemistry synthetic methods discussed above, several GNRs with 0.52 nm ribbon widths (where
