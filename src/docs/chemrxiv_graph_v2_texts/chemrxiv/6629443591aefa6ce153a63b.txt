Watersplitting dyesensitized photoelectrochemical cells 
(WSDSPECs) have been widely studied as a molecule
based system for lightdriven generation of hydrogen from 
water.13 This concept was built on the design of regenera
tive dyesensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which were devel
oped initially by Grtzel and coworkers in the mid1980s.4 
While advances in silicon, compound semiconductor, and 
perovskite solar cells have eclipsed those of DSSCs over the 
past few years, the DSSC has recently struck back with a rec
ordbreaking power conversion efficiency of 15.2.5 Both 
WSDSPECs and DSSCs involve ultrafast interfacial charge 
transfer steps, which are crucial for their energy conversion 
efficiency but are still not completely understood.
