The very first discovered FeNHC photosensitiser.

Despite the remarkable progress made in the coordination chem
istry and photophysics of Fecarbene complexes, consistent mech
anistic understanding of the undergoing excitedstate dynamics
is often still lacking; this profound knowledge could in fact also
be the key for reallife applications for solar cells and photocata
lysts. Inconsistencies may typically be rooted in discrepancies in
interpretations, stemming from the complexity of data acquired
by timeresolved (pumpprobe) experiments andor approxima
tions made in theoretical models for excitedstate simulations. For
FeNHCs, the scenario is best illustrated by the case of the very
first discovered FeNHC photosensitiser, Fe(bmip)22 (bmip 
2,6bis(3methylimidazole1ylidine)pyridine), shown in Figure
1, right.

Description:
A complex whose excited-state dynamics are fully resolved using full-dimensional hybrid quantum-classical excited-state simulations.

Text:
Clearly, there is a significant difference
in these experimental assignments, i.e., TOAS (485 nm excitation)
vs XES (400 nm excitation), as well as the XES data vs theory
in the appearance of the 100 fs 3MC component. This ultra
fast 3MLCT quenching channel could in fact have a vital role as it
challenges the general picture of Fecarbenes possessing longlived
MLCT states and potentially weakens the complexs photosensing
ability. Crucially, using fulldimensional hybrid quantumclassical
excitedstate simulations, we herein clarify and explain all impor
tant aspects and ambiguities of Fe(bmip)22, fully resolving its
excitedstate dynamics. . 2

Theory overview
In the following, we address the ultrafast (subps) quenching
of 3MLCT states by 3MC, observed by fsresolved XES.
