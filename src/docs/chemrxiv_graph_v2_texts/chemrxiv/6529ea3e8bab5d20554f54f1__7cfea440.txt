Description:
Involved in transition metal-catalyzed transfer to transform structural moieties into nitrogen-containing building blocks.

Text:
The presence of nitrogen functional groups in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products is essential 
to their beneficial physiochemical and biological properties.1,2 This importance of the carbonnitrogen bond has 
long inspired organic chemists to devise new methods for expedited and precise installation of nitrogen into 
compounds, advancements with significant potential to contribute to the identification and expansion of new 
chemical space. Toward this goal, transition metalcatalyzed nitrene transfer (NT) has emerged as an elegant 
strategy that directly transforms ubiquitous structural moieties, including olefins and CH bonds, into valuable 
nitrogencontaining building blocks.

Description:
Inserts into alkenes to form aziridines.

Text:
Chief among these are aziridines, resulting from nitrene insertions into alkenes, 
which are wellknown for their frequent occurrence in natural products and bioactive molecules, as well as their 
synthetic utility.3,4 The reactivity of these smallest Nheterocycles is mainly attributed to their strained nature that 
leads to a high propensity to undergo ringopening and ringexpansion processes, often with excellent regiocontrol 
and stereochemical integrity of the newly created stereogenic center(s).37 Therefore, aziridines are exceptionally 
versatile and efficient intermediates for olefin difunctionalization, as well as the construction of higher order 
heterocyclic scaffolds that feature prominently among medicinal chemists most desirable synthetic targets.819 
 Due to the potential of alkene aziridination to introduce structural and stereochemical complexity from feedstock 
starting materials, the development of enantioselective aziridination strategies via NT is of key importance in 
organic synthesis.

Description:
Precursors used in catalytic systems for asymmetric aziridinations.

Text:
Early work by Evans and Jacobsen reported asymmetric intermolecular aziridinations with 
copper salts supported by chiral bis(oxazoline) (BOX)20 and chiral diaminebased ligands21, respectively (Scheme 
1A). Although satisfactory yields and ee were observed with only a few select substrates, these results stimulated 
the discovery of several catalytic systems for both asymmetric inter and intramolecular aziridinations that employ 
a variety of other metals, ligand scaffolds, and nitrene precursors.7,2224 Despite remarkable advances in both 
generality and efficiency, most of these methods, especially for intermolecular reactions, give the best results for 
terminal, styrenebased, and other conjugated olefins. In contrast, intramolecular aziridinations via NT exhibit 
superior reactivity and stereoselectivity with internal and unactivated olefins, yet have received much less attention 
(Scheme 1B).
