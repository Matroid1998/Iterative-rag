Description:
Anionic brushes functionalized on nanochannel walls for regulating electroosmotic and pressuredriven electrokinetic transport.

Text:
Das and coworkers also employed this allatom MD simulation framework for 
capturing the effect of functionalizing the nanochannel walls with such PE brushes in regulating 
the electroosmotic transport and pressuredriven electrokinetic transport.5153,59 Specifically, for 
the case where the nanochannels were grafted with Naionscreened anionic PAA brushes, there
