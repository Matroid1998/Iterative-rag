Description:
Used as a masked primary amide to prevent epimerization and imide formation during carboxylic acid activation.

After screening a variety 
of activation reagents, the combination of PyAOP with HOAt was 
found to be the most effective conditions under which to forge the 
macrocycle to yield 4 in 54 yield over two steps. The aziridinebased strategy outlined above could be leveraged 
again to forge the tryptophanasparagine linkage. Thus, western 
fragment 3 was prepared by employing 2methyl furan as a 
nucleophile onto aziridine 7. The use of 2methylfuran as a masked 
primary amide provided several advantages, notably avoiding 
undesired side reactions such as epimerization of the bcarbon and 
imide formation during carboxylic acid activation.
