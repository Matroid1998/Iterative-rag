Description:
Involved in dynamic covalent exchange in Michael addition reactions.

Text:
With a global recycling rate of plastics as low as 9 in 2019,1 multiple strategies reaching from 
mechanical recycling to chemical recycling or upcycling need to be targeted to increase recycling rates. Whereas in chemical recycling the polymer is degraded into its monomer,2 by upcycling new 
molecules, polymers or materials are obtained.3 Thus, implementing reversible reactions in polymer 
chemistry is key for forming recyclable materials. Upon depolymerization of polymers, building blocks 
suitable for subsequent polymerization can be obtained. Recently lots of research has been performed 
in the field of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) or vitrimers, which undergo reversible reaction 
under external stimuli such as pH, heat or UV light. Regarding Michael addition reactions, dynamic 
covalent exchange for thiol and aminebased Michael adducts has been reported.

Description:
Involved in the transfer from a ketone to an acrylate product.

Text:
by the transfer of a thiol from a ketone to an acrylate 
product at 90 C7 (Scheme 1) or by the exchange of thiophenol with mercaptoethanol in a thiolketone 
or thiolmaleimide adduct at 90 C.5,8 Moreover, dynamic exchange of thiaMichael polymer networks 
is reported.7,8,9 Examples include thiolmaleimide linkers in RAFT based materials, thiolacrylate linkers 
in covalently crosslinked polyester networks or thiolvinyl sulfone linkers in polymeric network formed 
by radical polymerization.8,9,10 Those materials show reshaping and selfhealing ability at temperatures 
from 90 to 100 C. Also networks solely built up by thiolMichael reaction with cinnamonitrile 
derivative show selfhealing behaviour from 60 C onward.11 Moreover, reversible thiolyne 
crosslinking was demonstrated by the group of P. Du Prez.12 Regarding retro azaMichael reaction 
typically high temperatures ( 150 C) are required.
