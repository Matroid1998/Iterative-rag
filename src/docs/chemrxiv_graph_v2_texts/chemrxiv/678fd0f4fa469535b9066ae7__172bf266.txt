Description:
A high-energy isomer of acetylene with a very low barrier for isomerization.

Text:
Vinylidene (H2CC) is a highenergy isomer of acetylene (HCCH), and isomerization between 
the two species represents the simplest example of a 1,2hydrogen shift reaction.1 Vinylidene has 
been the focus of many theoretical211 and experimental1218 studies owing to its very low barrier 
for isomerization to acetylene (0.1 eV),19 which opens the possibility for coupling between 
vibrational states of vinylidene and highly excited acetylene. Because of the low isomerization 
barrier, the vibration of vinylidene can be strongly anharmonic, especially for modes related to the 
isomerization coordinate. In fact, such departures from the harmonic limit encode the 
isomerization dynamics.

Description:
A stable anionic counterpart of vinylidene that is straightforward to produce in the gas phase.

Text:
Moreover, the ground and lowlying electronic states of vinylidene are 
subject to nonadiabatic effects including intersystem crossings, conical intersections, and 
HerzbergTeller (HT) coupling.17, 20 While neutral vinylidene is a highly reactive transient species 
and thus difficult to study directly, its anionic counterpart H2CC is stable and straightforward to 
produce in the gas phase. Previous experimental studies on vinylidene have taken advantage of the 
stability of the anion by using anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) to measure the effect 
isomerization plays on the neutral vibrational structure.12, 17, 2022 In this paper, we aim to further 
study the vinylidene system by infrared (IR) vibrational excitation of cryogenically cooled anions 
paired with slow electron velocitymap imaging (IR cryoSEVI).
