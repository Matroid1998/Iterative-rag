Description:
Mn2 ions in bulk oxides have a high-spin state with a magnetic moment of 5 Bohr magnetons.

Text:
In bulk oxides, the coordi
nation geometry of manganese and cobalt ions is usually
tetrahedral (Td) or octahedral (Oh) resulting in highspin
state for both Co2 and Mn2 ions (with magnetic mo
ments MS of 3 and 5 B, respectively). In contrast, for
Co3 three dierent spin states are possible, i.e. lowspin
axel.grossuniulm.de
(MS  0B), highspin (MS  4B), and intermediate
spin (MS  2B). In this case the spin state is very
sensitive to changes in the coordination geometry, e.g.,
CoO length or CoOCo angle. Dierent to the cobalt,
in manganese oxides Mn3 always remains in highspin
state (MS  4B) 18.
