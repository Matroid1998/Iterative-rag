Description:
Compounds that can be reduced via catalytic hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen to synthesize amine compounds.

Text:
Amines are key intermediates in the 
chemical industry. Due to their nucleophilic 
properties, they impart high reactivity1. Various amines, including primary, secondary, 
and tertiary amines, are widely used to produce 
agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, and 
polymers2. Primary amines, in particular, are 
important raw materials for manufacturing 
drugs, 
pesticides, 
emulsifiers, 
and 
plasticizers3. Currently, the methods for 
synthesizing primary amines include reductive 
amination 
of 
carbonyl 
compounds4, 
hydrogenation 
of 
nitro 
compounds5, 
amination of alcohols6, reduction of nitrile 
compounds7, and Nalkylation of halogenated 
compounds8. Among them, the catalytic 
hydrogenation of nitrile compounds using 
molecular hydrogen as a reducing agent has the 
advantages of high atom economy9 and 
a simple process and is a popular choice for the 
industrial synthesis of amine compounds10. However, nitrile hydrogenation also has 
disadvantages.

Description:
Compounds involved in hydrogenation reduction using precious metals.

Text:
The hydrogenation mechanism 
is complex as shown in Fig 1. The byproducts 
include 
partially 
hydrogenated 
nitrile 
compounds, also known as imines, and 
condensation 
side 
reactions 
with 
other 
nucleophilic substances such as substrates in 
the hydrogenation system to form secondary 
and tertiary amines11, resulting in the problem 
of low selectivity of the amination product in 
the reaction12. It is still a huge challenge to 
obtain primary amines with high selectivity. Precious metals such as Ru13, Pd14, Pt15, 
Re16, etc. are more commonly used in nitrile 
hydrogenation 
reduction 
and 
some 
heterogeneous 
catalysts 
have 
superior 
conversion effects17. However, the scarcity 
and high cost of precious metals hinder their 
widespread 
industrial 
application, 
while 
transition metals18, which are more abundant 
in earth resources and have lower costs, have 
come into the public eye19.

Description:
Compounds that are usually hydrogenated by metal catalysts such as Ni and Co under harsh conditions.

Text:
However, metal contamination and 
recycling issues of these catalytic systems limit 
their commercial development and largescale 
utilization. In heterogeneous catalytic systems, 
metal catalysts such as Ni23 and Co24 usually 
hydrogenate nitrile compounds under harsh 
conditions25. From the perspective of green 
chemistry and sustainable development, it is of 
great significance to develop nonprecious 
metal catalysts that can show high activity 
under mild conditions.26 
Recently, much more fit for the above 
requirements 
of 
green 
chemistry 
and 
sustainable development, the advanced flow 
synthesis methodology attracted more and 
more 
attention.
