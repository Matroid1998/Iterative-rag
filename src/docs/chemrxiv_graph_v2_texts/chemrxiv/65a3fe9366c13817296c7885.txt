Description:
Commonly involved in mineralization processes, forming minerals in confined spaces.

Text:
The ions 
used in biomineralization are sequestered and 
concentrated from the aqueous environment.2 Highly 
disordered and hydrated minerals are formed and 
transported into the mineralization sites.3, 4 The 
mineralization sites are often performed confined and 
delimited spaces.5 These mineralization pathways 
serve several functional purposes, such as the rapid 
delivery of the dense mineral material into 
mineralization space and the ability to mold it into the 
required shape and size without constraints that are 
derived from crystal anisotropy and natural habit.6 
Another trait common to many mineralizing calcium
