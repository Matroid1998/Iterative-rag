Description:
A greenhouse gas with atmospheric concentration surpassing 420 ppm in 2022, affecting climate change.

Text:
Despite the numerous legislative acts that have been put forth in order to mitigate CO2 emissions, the 
atmospheric CO2 concentration has surpassed 420 ppm in 2022 and is affecting climate change all over 
the world.1 Reduction of CO2 emissions is therefore an unavoidable challenge to solve climate change.2 
Postcombustion CO2 capture has been performed directly from many point sources, e.g. steel and 
cement plants,3, 4 and has no doubt contributed to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the 
atmospheric CO2 concentration has continued to increase. Therefore, new CO2 capture technologies are 
required to be developed on both the material and method side in order to efficiently adsorb CO2 at low
