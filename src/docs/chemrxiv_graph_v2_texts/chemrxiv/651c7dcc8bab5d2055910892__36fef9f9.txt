Description:
A component of air separated from O2 and N2 during cryogenic distillation.

Text:
Enriched or highpurity O2 is a critical commodity in the medical, 
manufacturing, and aerospace industries and for the production of 
feedstock chemicals such as ethylene oxide and phthalic anhy
dride.1,2 The vast majority of O2 is produced from the cryogenic dis
tillation of air.3,4 This multistep process involves compression and 
pretreatment of air to remove volatile organic compounds, water, 
and CO2, and then the resulting gaseous mixturepredominantly 
O2, N2, and Aris expanded and cooled to cryogenic temperatures 
upon passing through a series of heat exchangers, before being fed 
into distillation columns where O2 is separated from N2 and Ar (Fig
ure 1a).
