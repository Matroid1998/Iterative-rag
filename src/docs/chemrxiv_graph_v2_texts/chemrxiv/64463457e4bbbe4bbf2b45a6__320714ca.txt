Description:
Originates from CH4 in CH3OH.

Text:
All these clearly reveal that the carbon in CH3OH originated 
from CH4 and not from CO. Further, the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic 
study for the reaction using 13CO indicates that the carbon in carboxyl group of CH3COOH 
originated from CO (Figure S20), confirming that the present AuHMOR could catalyze the
