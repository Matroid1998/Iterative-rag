Description:
A neurotransmitter that binds to ionotropic receptors, causing the channel pore to open.

Text:
Ionotropic glutamate receptors are cationpermeable ion channels responsible for fast excita
tory signal transmission in vertebrate neurons.1 Upon glutamate binding, the transmembrane
channel pore adopts an open conguration that is nonselective for monovalent cations. In
amino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR), the permeabil
ity for calcium depends exquisitely on their composition. The GluA2 subunit gene encodes
a Gln at residue 586, but posttranscriptional RNA editing yields an Arg residue (QR site)
at about 96 2 of subunits in the brain. If they lack the edited GluA2(R) subunit, AMPAR
