Description:
A potential hydrogen carrier and fuel.

Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most produced chemicals in the
world, with over 150 million metric tons being produced each year.1
It is essential for the manufacturing of fertilizer needed to feed the
growing world population.2,3 NH3 is also a potential carbonfree
energy carrier, capable of storing surplus energy from renewable
energy sources, a possible hydrogen carrier, and fuel.416
The HaberBosch process is by far the most prevalent method for
converting nitrogen (N2) into ammonia, but requires high temper
ature (400650C) and pressure (200400atm) for industrial
scale production of NH3.2,3,17,18 Finding a catalyst capable of
producing ammonia more efficiently, or under more ambient con
ditions, would be a major boon for the worlds population and cli
mate, and could potentially even allow for decentralized, smaller
scale production of fertilizer close to the point of use, reducing
transportation costs and the need for distribution infrastructure.19
The N2 molecule is especially inert, with a very stable triple
bond, no dipole moment and very low polarizability.4 The N2
dissociation to 2N is therefore often the ratelimiting step (RLS)
in the chemical synthesis of NH3 from nitrogen via the dissocia
tive pathway (see Fig.
