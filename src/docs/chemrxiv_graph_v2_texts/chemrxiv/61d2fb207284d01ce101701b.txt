Description:
An organometallic compound discovered in 1951.

Text:
Since the discovery of ferrocene in 1951,1,2 cyclopentadienyl 
ligands have developed into one of the most fundamental ligand 
families in organometallic chemistry and have found wide
spread use in (asymmetric) catalysis,3,4 small molecule activa
tion,5 and coordination chemistry (e.g. for the synthesis of sin
gle molecule magnets).6,7 Cyclopentadienyl ligands are classi
cal spectatorligands and their steric and electronic properties 
can be readily modified by introducing one or more substituents 
on the carbon atoms. These substitutions have dramatic effects, 
including slower rotational dynamics in the fivemembered ring 
as well as higher steric protection of the coordinated metal cen
tre.
