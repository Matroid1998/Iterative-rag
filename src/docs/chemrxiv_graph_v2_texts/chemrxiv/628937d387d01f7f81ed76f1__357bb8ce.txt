Description:
A low thermal conductivity material with promising thermoelectric performance.

Text:
Inspired by this chemical space of materials, the
valencebalanced Sc2Te3 was synthesized and found to have   2
WmK.25 Due to the prevalence of rareearth chalcogenide TE
materials, it is, therefore, natural to ask if there are other poten
tially highperforming TE materials within this chemical space. Zhu et al. identified Y2Te3 as a lowL material with promis
ing TE performance in their preliminary investigations.10 The or

Description:
Has ordered vacancies that likely promote point defect scattering of phonons and lattice softening.

Text:
Besides the preliminary studies undertaken by Zhu et al.,10 rel
atively little is known about the fundamental TE transport prop
erties and doping characteristics of Y2Te3. The ordered vacancies
in the Y2Te3 structure likely promotes point defect scattering of
phonons and lattice softening,31,32 both of which contribute to
the lowering of L. The TE performance of Y2Te3 was found to
be comparable to La3xTe4 and Yb14MnSb11, reaching a zT 0.8
at 900 K when dopedalloyed with Bi.10 In their study, Zhu et
