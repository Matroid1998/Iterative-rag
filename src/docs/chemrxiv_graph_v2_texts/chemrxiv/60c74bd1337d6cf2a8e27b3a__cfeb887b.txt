Description:
Dependence on O2 might be incorrectly described in isobutanol combustion models.

Detailed isobu
tanol mechanisms typically deviate more from experiments
than do models of nbutanol, tertbutanol and secbutanol.7,8
Multiple intermodel comparisons using detailed isobutanol
models have showed that at lean, lowtemperature conditions
the models yield a wide range of ignition timings that devi
ate from experimental ignition delay measurements in homo
geneous charge compression9 and shock tube setups.10 One
mechanism shows the largest deviations from experiments be
low 850 K and at fuel lean conditions, indicating that the
dependence on O2 might be incorrectly described.11
Such shortcomings of isobutanol combustion indicate a
need for an improved understanding of isobutanol combus
tion in combustion regimes in which peroxy radical chemistry
is often important.12 The dominant degradation pathway of
peroxy radicals at various temperatures and pressures impacts
overall ignition properties such as the negative temperature
coecient region, in which ignition slows with increasing tem
