Description:
A fragment of protein used in the MFCC scheme.

Figure 1 Illustration of the MFCC scheme for an alanine dipeptide. The protein is cut at
the peptide bonds. The dangling bonds of the resulting fragments are capped by acetyl
groups (red) and by Nmethylamide groups (blue). These two caps are joined to form a
new cap molecule, Nmethylacetamid. One particularly popular fragmentation method for proteins is the Molecular Fraction
ation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC) method 1517. It allows for the linearscaling
calculation of, e.g., total energies of proteins, proteinligand and proteinprotein inter
action energies, as well as electron densities and other properties of proteins 1822. In the simplest case, the protein is partitioned into single amino acids by cutting the
peptide bonds.
