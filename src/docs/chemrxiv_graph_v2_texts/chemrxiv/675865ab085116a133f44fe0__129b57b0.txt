Description:
Dianions often referred to as weakly coordinating or superweak anions.

Owing to this behaviour, B12X122 dianions are often referred to as weakly 
coordinating or superweak anions.9,10 In the gas phase, however, small dianions such as SO42 
and HPO42 are unstable, whereas B12X122 species may be readily produced, trapped, and 
probed.6,11,12 This exceptional stability enables the study of ionic clusters containing B12X122.
