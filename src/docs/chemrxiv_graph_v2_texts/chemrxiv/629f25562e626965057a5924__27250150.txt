Description:
Associated with gravimetric uptake in activated carbon pores at specific pressures.

Computational methods at
tempt to determine the uptake of the sorptive in an idealised
sorbent with pores of a single width via DFT or GCMC meth
ods.5,12,37 Whereas experimental data can be used to perform
ing linear regressions of uptake at a given pressure against pore
volume in a certain range (usually all pores below some maxi
mum).11,13,15,17,35,38 By the latter method, Presser et al deter
mined (N24) that at 1.0 bar, pores in activated carbons of width
8  are most strongly associated with gravimetric CO2 uptake,
while this reduced to 5  for uptake at 0.1 bar.
