Galliumcontaining materials are employed as catalysts in an array of industriallyrelevant reactions, 
including alkane dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization, amongst others.19 However, the role 
and the structures of Ga sites in these materials are often debated, with an array of oxidation states, 
geometries and charge states invoked across the existing literature.36,913 This apparent ambiguity is 
due, in part, to the fact that direct insights into the distribution and geometry of Ga surface sites using 
conventional spectroscopic techniques remains challenging. One technique that has been widely used 
for understanding Gacontaining oxide materials is Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), which can 
be used to provide insights into the coordination environment of Ga in materials.
