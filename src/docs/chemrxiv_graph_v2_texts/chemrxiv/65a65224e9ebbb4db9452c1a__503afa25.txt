Description:
Elements that can affect molecule-sheet interactions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).

Consequently, chalcogens compris
ing the TMDs could directly affects moleculesheet interactions. On
the other hand, MX bonds could also play an important role in charge
distribution in the sheet, and thus have some impact on the adsorp
tion. This in turn, could affect the interaction between acceptortype
molecules and TMD sheets, thus impacting their sensitivity to NOx. The sensitivity of the sensor relies significantly on the charge trans
fer (Q) occurring between the analyte and the sensing layer. This pro
cess directly impacts observable properties like conductivity and pho
toluminescence, making it feasible to detect gases. Conversely, the
recovery of the sensor depends on the adsorption energy (Eads) of the
target species, as it governs desorption rates.
