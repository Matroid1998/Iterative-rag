Description:
Accepts two electrons and two protons from reducing and acidic substrates.

Special attention has being directed at improving the efficiency of 
energy conversion, which plays a pivotal role in slowing global 
warming and addressing energyrelated challenges such as 
biomass power generation. Among them, the redox system of 
bioactive quinone as an electron carrier in organisms is promising 
for realizing truly efficient energy conversion in industrial use.1,2 
In particular, aerobic organisms efficiently convert energy using 
dioxygen (O2) and quinones. In the photosystem II protein 
complex,1,3 plastoquinone exhibits two distinct electroncarrying 
modes depending on their proton environment quinone
hydroquinone (QH2Q, electron acceptor and electron donor) 
conjugation. In the QH2Q redox system, the cyclohexa2,5
diene1,4dione (benzoquinone, Q) moiety accepts two electrons 
and two protons from reducing and acidic substrates, forming the 
reduced form, benzene1,4diol (hydroquinone, H2Q) moiety.
