Description:
Compounds with toxic fluorinated portions that are resistant to degradation.

Text:
As plants and the bacteria associated with them are typically not able to degrade CF 
70 
bonds,5 PFAS removed from the soil by hemp are likely to retain the toxic fluorinated portion of 
71 
their structure. A potential advantage of using fiber hemp for this work is that the parts of the plant 
72 
that are less susceptible to bioaccumulation of PFAS (stems) may be able to be used in products
