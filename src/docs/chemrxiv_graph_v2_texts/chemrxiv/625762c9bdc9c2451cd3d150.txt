Description:
Oligomers with intriguing photophysical properties and potential for single-molecular conductance through orbital overlap.

Text:
Among various porphyrinoid oligomers, oxobridged molecular arrays have attracted 
attention due to their long wirelike shape, singlemolecular conductance through the orbital 
overlap, sequence control and intriguing photophysical properties.1,2 Despite such promising 
features, their emission characteristics have been not wellstudied probably due to the weak 
emission intensity. Furthermore, the emission could be observed in the NIR region in many 
cases as a result of excitonic interaction. Although NIR emissive dyes are one of attractive 
research targets, detection of low energy bands and detailed photophysical measurements need
