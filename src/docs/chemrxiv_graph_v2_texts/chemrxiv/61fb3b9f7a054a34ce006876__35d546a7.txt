Description:
Involved in the hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) growth mechanism.

Text:
Physical nucleation of PAHs is only possible for 
large PAHs (667 Da), but these species fail to be 
observed in experimental studies due to their low 
concentrations 10. Chemical nucleation is a process 
where reactive sites on PAHs are chemically combined 
to form a stable structure. These reactive sites can be 
connected by acetylene, which refers to the wellknown 
hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) 
growth mechanism 9. Another chemical pathway is 
the formation of a bonding network where radicals 
directly react with PAH radicals without the 
requirement of hydrogen abstraction 11. These 
radicals can be stabilized due to delocalization, also 
known as longlived resonantly stabilized radicals 
(RSRs).
