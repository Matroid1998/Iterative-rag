Description:
Useful isosteric replacements for carbonyl compounds in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Molecular scaffolds featuring strained fourmembered rings have become increasingly popular in medicinal chemistry 
due to their ability to modulate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of drug candidates.1,2 These motifs 
can lead to increased solubility, greater metabolic stability, and improved interactions between receptors and ligands.3,4 
Cyclobutanes, azetidines, and oxetanes in particular have been demonstrated to be useful isosteric replacements for 
aryl rings, piperidines, and carbonyl compounds, respectively.512
