Description:
Has the highest energy density on a gravimetric basis of any energy carrier.

Text:
Establishing a renewable energy economy based on hydrogen requires technologies that support the 
three enabling pillars of production, utilization, and storage. As is well known,1 hydrogen has the highest 
energy density on a gravimetric basis of any energy carrier but its volumetric energy density is much lower 
than conventional fuels.

Description:
Used in both stationary applications and transportation, with varying storage capacity and delivery rates.

Text:
Materialsbased storage systems have long been considered as an alternative to 
pressurized hydrogen gas for light duty vehicles (LDV), driven by the technical targets set by the U.S. 
DOE.2 However, the application space for hydrogen is undergoing a major expansion and now includes 
stationary uses as well as transportation.1 The associated storage capacity and delivery rates for these 
diverse use cases differ by orders of magnitude, making it likely that no single material will be able to 
meet all requirements.
