Description:
A hybrid metallosilicate that acts as an active catalyst for the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene.

. The extent 
of the hydrolytic SiC(sp2) bond cleavage is quantitatively followed by 29Si MAS NMR, TG analysis, 
and GCFID analysis of effluent coming from samples exposed to water vapor. Two important 
features affecting the hydrothermal and thermal stability are identified (i) the homogeneity of 
metal dispersion within the silica matrix, and (ii) the electronegativity of the incorporated metal. The stability of hybrid metallosilicates is significantly improved by replacing the phenylene bridges 
with xylylene bridges, due to the presence of more stable SiC(sp3) bonds. Interestingly, the latter 
hybrid metallosilicate proves to be an active catalyst for the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene. Unlike the other hybrid materials presented here, it reaches high ethylene yields without 
undergoing degradation and deactivation.
