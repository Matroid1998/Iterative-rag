The source of 77% of the human contribution to environmental climate challenges.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most emitted anthropogenic greenhouse gas by mass and has been assessed to 
30 
be the source of 77 of the human contribution to the environmental climate challenges 1. Correspondingly, 
31 
the global CO2 emissions from industrial processes and combustion of fuels for energy production have 
32 
rapidly increased and reached an annual emission of 36.3 Gt in 2021 2. As a response to negate the global 
33 
growth of CO2 emissions, the development of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) processes, where CO2 is 
34 
captured and converted to valueadded products, have been intensified correspondingly to a projected 
35 
annual utilization potential of 300600 Mt CO2 for chemicals in 2050 and 10004200 Mt CO2 for fuels 3.

Description:
Converted to biomethane for decarbonization and used in biogas plants.

Text:
A key 
36 
product from CCU is the production of biomethane (CH4) from CO2, which is promoting the abatement of 
37 
greenhouse gas emissions 4. Biomethane utilizes the existing gas infrastructure and can be utilized to relieve 
38 
the peak loads from nondispatchable renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and PV by balancing 
39 
the energy system to reinforce the security of supply. Moreover, the production of biomethane from CO2 is 
40 
necessary for the decarbonization of the hardtoabate sector, where electrification is challenged in 
41 
applications such as longdistance heavyduty transport and industrial processes that are reliant on carbon
42 
based fuels 5. 43 
The use of biomethanation has until now primarily been applied to conversion of CO2 from biogas plants.
