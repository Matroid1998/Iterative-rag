Description:
Relatively electronegative elements that exhibit exceptional nucleophilic properties in their anionic state.

Text:
Halogens, being relatively electronegative elements, exhibit exceptional nucleophilic proper
ties in their anionic state.1 However, this nucleophilicity diminishes as they transition into
a diatomic state through the formation of covalent bonds with more electronegative atoms. Consequently, this leads to the emergence of an electrondeficient or electrophilic region
