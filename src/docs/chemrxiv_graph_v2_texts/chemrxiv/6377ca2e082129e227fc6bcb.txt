5(E)2(4Hydroxyphenyl)ethen1ylbenzene1,3diol 
(transresveratrol, 
RsvH3) 
is 
a 
stilbenoid, a kind of natural phenolic compound,1 and a phytoalexin,2 which is found in 
mulberries, grapes, and red wine.24 RsvH3 shows a surprising number of health benefits, the 
mitigation of agerelated diseases including carcinogenesis and neurodegeneration, and 
pharmacological activities such as antiinflammatory and cardioprotective properties.1,59 Since 
their pathogenic seems to be related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in several 
biochemical processes and pathologies, RsvH3 could be valuable as a multitarget molecule 
against several diseases.
