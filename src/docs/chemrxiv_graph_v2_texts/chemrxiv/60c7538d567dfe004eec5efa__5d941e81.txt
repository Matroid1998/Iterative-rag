Description:
Synthesized de novo using cysteine as the rate limiting substrate.

The elevated expression of system xC
 in a wide range of cancer types can be targeted by
radiotracers specific to this transporter to provide high contrast images of tumors 7, 11, 1618. Clinically, 18FFSPG has been evaluated in hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung
cancer, prostate cancer and intracranial malignancies 9, 15, 18, 19. Interest in noninvasively imaging system xC
 has increased as its central role in modulating
cellular redox homeostasis has emerged 17, 2022. System xC
 transports extracellular cystine
into the cell in exchange for intracellular glutamate 23. Once transported into the cell, cystine is
quickly reduced to cysteine, the rate limiting substrate for de novo glutathione synthesis 24.

Description:
Essential for the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis.

Text:
Glutathione is essential for the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, and is often
upregulated in cancer cells in response to elevated levels of ROS 25. Subsequently, elevated
expression and activity of system xC
 can increase the antioxidant capacity of cancer cells,
resulting in resistance to chemotherapy 26. In mouse models of ovarian cancer, 18FFSPG was
