Description:
Molecular oxygen used as the oxidant in redox reactions during contaminant biodegradation.

Understanding biodegradation processes of anthropogenic organic contaminants in natural and
33
engineered environments including soils, sediments, as well as (waste)water treatment plants is
34
a critical step for designing measures that maintain ecosystem services and sustainable access to
35
food and water under increasing human impact.15 Contaminant biodegradation routes often
36
involve redox reactions with molecular O2 as the oxidant.

Uncoupling phenomenon associated with the release of reactive oxygen species.

vironmental microbiomes are continuously exposed to a broad variety of organic contaminants
48
that causes microbes to adapt their metabolism to xenobiotic compounds as novel substrates
49
and metagenomic information indeed hints at ongoing sequence mutations.10,11,2936

It is hypothesized that the evolution of oxygenases that can transform new contaminants in
51
biodegradation processes is tied to the erroneous handling of activated oxygen and the ensuing
52
release of reactive oxygen species (ROS),3739 a phenomenon referred to as O2 uncoupling.4045
53
Reactions with ROS can in fact inactivate proteins.
