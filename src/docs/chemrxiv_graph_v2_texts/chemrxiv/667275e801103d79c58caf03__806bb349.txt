However, 
conventional methods for generating radical anions or cations 
often require the use of extensive oxidizing or reducing agents, 
some of which may be environmentally hazardous. However, 
nonchemical stimuli such as light or heat can control the spin of 
a molecule dynamically that may provide switchable materials for 
applications in memory and switches.13 The ability to have on
demand control over the formation and destruction of radicals is 
intriguing. Successful switching of spin states in allorganic 
molecules is a rare achievement. 1418 Abes research group has 
crafted a singlemolecule photochromic switch. This switch 
comprises hexaarylbisimidazole units capable of undergoing 
rapid and reversible biradical formation, with a halflife measured 
in milliseconds even at room temperature.19
