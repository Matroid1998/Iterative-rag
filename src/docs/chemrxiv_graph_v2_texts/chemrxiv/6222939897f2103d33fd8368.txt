Description:
A target for capture and storage applications using Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) due to its presence in greenhouse gases.

Finally, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on graph properties to 
successfully deconvolute MOF selfassembly into a small number of molecular descriptors, such as the average coordination 
number between halfSBUs and fractal dimension, which can be followed by timeresolved spectroscopy. We conclude that 
graph theory can be used to understand complex processes such as MOF nucleation through providing molecular descriptors 
accessible by both simulation and experiment. INTRODUCTION 
MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) constitute a class of po
rous materials that thanks to their high porosity and surface 
area, have ignited interest in a plethora of applications in
cluding carbon capture and storage1, 2, separations3, extrac
tion of water from air4, electrodes5 and drug delivery6.
