Description:
Used as catalysts in traditional AP methods for water splitting and CO reduction.

Text:
The reduced
titanium species, with increased electron density, effectively capture atmospheric CO, initiating a
spontaneous and intricate reduction process that produces longchain oxygenated hydrocarbons. This solardriven, autonomous production distinguishes the system from conventional AP methods. Traditional AP approaches primarily target water splitting and CO reduction to small hydrocarbons
(C1C3) using metal oxide catalysts. These methods often require high CO concentrations and
separate processes, achieving limited success. In contrast, the novel organotitaniumbased system
integrates water splitting and CO reduction into a single, continuous process, producing oxygenated
organics directly from ambient CO (0.04). This capability to convert trace amounts of CO into
valuable materials represents a significant leap in AP technology.
