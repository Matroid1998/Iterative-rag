Description:
Used as a substrate for surface functionalization and experiments.

of novel, flat silicon substrates as replacements for prisms. We illustrate the feasibility of this technique for 
bottom illuminated AFMIR in both air and liquid. We also show how modern rapid prototyping technologies enable commercial 
AFMIR instrumentations to accept these new substrates. This new methodic approach paves the way for a wide range of experi
ments since virtually any established protocol for Si surface functionalization can be applied to this sample carrier and the low unit 
cost enables rapid iteration of experiments. INTRODUCTION 
MidInfrared (IR) spectroscopy provides information about 
molecular chemical composition through wellestablished 
spectrastructure correlations. Absorption of midIR light 
stimulates vibrational modes, enabling identification of specif
ic functional groups.
