Description:
Used in hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposite materials to resist atomic oxygen attack.

Thus, an 
appropriatelydesigned VLEO satellite would be expected to have materials on its exterior surfaces that are 
highly AOresistant while keeping gassurface energy and momentum transfer to a minimum. Polymers 
are desired over inorganic materials because of their significant weight advantage and the ease with which 
their functions can be tailored using different chemical formulations. A general approach to producing AOresistant polymeric materials is copolymerization or blending 
of an organic polymer with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) to yield a hybrid 
organicinorganic nanocomposite material that can resist AO attack through the formation of a passivating 
SiOx layer, while not significantly altering the mechanical or optical properties of the base organic
