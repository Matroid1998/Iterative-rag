Description:
A promising and cost-effective candidate for next-generation positive electrode materials for Li-ion batteries.

Text:
Spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is one of the most promising and 
costeffective candidates for nextgeneration positive electrode 
materials for Liion batteries. This material offers a high capacity 
of 147 mAh.g1 due to the oxidation of Ni2 to Ni4 at an average 
potential of 4.7 V vs. LiLi, which results in an appealing energy 
density of 650 Whkg.1,2 However, some issues still prevent its im
plementation in commercial devices. Limited stability of electro
lytes at such high potentials leads to secondary reactions at the elec
trodeelectrolyte interface involving Mn dissolution into the elec
trolyte and cathode electrolyte interphase growth.3 A deep compre
hension and adjustment of its intrinsic properties are necessary to 
make LNMObased batteries available.

Description:
A stoichiometric phase that loses oxygen at elevated temperatures.

Text:
In LNMO spinel structure, Ni and Mn can occupy either a single 
crystallographic site or two different ones within cubic symmetry 
unit cells. The first unit cell is described in the Fd3m space group 
and associated with a disordered (statistical) distribution of transi
tion metal ions, whereas the second one is described in the P4332 
space group and associated with a 13 ordering between the two 
transition metal ions. The disordered LNMO is generally obtained 
via hightemperature solidstate syntheses ( 900C), inevitably 
next to a rocksalttype impurity such as NiO and LixNi1xO.4 The 
formation of this mixture of phases is driven by the oxygen loss 
from the stoichiometric phase LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 at such elevated tem
peratures.
