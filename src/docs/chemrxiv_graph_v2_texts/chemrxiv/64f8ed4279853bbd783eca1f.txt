Description:
Nanoparticles used to create catalytic systems that can degrade organic pollutants.

Text:
If the oil layer contains compounds that can cure and solidify, the double 
emulsion droplet can be converted into a microcapsule in which a thin shell surrounds a liquid aqueous 
interior.17 These microcapsules are useful for several applications, including drug or fragrance 
delivery,1, 6, 8 cosmetics and food additives encapsulation,1 as microreactors for enzymes,9 or as a shell 
for artificial cells.5, 9 Double emulsion capsules have also been used to encapsulate nanoparticles, for 
instance, TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles, to create catalytic systems that can degrade organic pollutants.10 
Shell materials of these microcapsules can be synthetic or natural polymers, or colloidal particles that 
stabilize the oil phase. These components or their precursors must be soluble in the oil phase, namely 
an organic solvent that is not miscible with water.
