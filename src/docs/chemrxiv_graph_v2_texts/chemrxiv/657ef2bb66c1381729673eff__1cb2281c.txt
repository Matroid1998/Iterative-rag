Description:
A putative species formed through the interception of alkylPd(II) with a highly electrophilic chlorination reagent.

Text:
1,2Arylpalladation to the carboncarbon double bond of 
the alkene generates an alkylPd(II) intermediate, the interception 
of which with a highly electrophilic chlorination reagent leads to the 
formation of a putative alkylPd(IV)Cl species and prompts CCl 
bond formation through reductive elimination. Although these 
highvalent Pdmediated transformations have underpinned the 
syntheses of many arylethyl chlorides, the use aryl tin reagents di
minishes the attractiveness of these methods (Figure 1B)12. We reasoned that the invention of a mechanistically distinct modu
lar and catalytic method for the synthesis of alkyl chlorides would be 
a valuable addition to the arsenal of synthetic tools and of interest to 
practitioners of moleculemaking in academic and industrial envi
ronments.
