Description:
Has low solubility in oil and water and poor bioavailability in oral administration.

Text:
However, low solubility in oil and water, 
poor bioavailability of 40 in oral administration, sensitivity to basic and acidic environments, and the 
resistance developed by the malariacausing microorganism must be addressed for its effective use 5. Many strategies have been considered to address the challenges related to the effective use of artemisinin 
combined therapies. These include the use of materials, specifically nanoparticles, as drugdelivery 
systems 6. Nanomaterials such as liposomes, micronanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles,
