Description:
Has a very high binding energy of 945 kJ mol⁻¹.

Text:
In the HaberBosch process, a typical method for industrial ammonia synthesis, Febased catalysts 
have been used for more than 100 years, and the addition of alkali metals enhances their activity 5. In industrial 
processes, Febased catalysts synthesize ammonia at 400600C and 100300 atm 2,5. These severe conditions 
are due to the very high binding energy of the N2 molecule (945 kJ mol1). Synthesis plants become massive and 
centralized to produce ammonia more cheaply and in larger quantities for benefits of scale 6,7. Rubased catalysts, the next generation of ammonia synthesis catalysts, are less susceptible to ammonia 
poisoning and more active than Febased catalysts 5,8. Ru is one of the best metals for ammonia synthesis 
based on a volcano plot 9.
