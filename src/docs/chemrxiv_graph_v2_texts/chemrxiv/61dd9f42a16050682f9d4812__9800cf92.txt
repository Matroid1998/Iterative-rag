Description:
Functions as a redox mediator in a Z-scheme for water splitting.

Text:
Both 
photocatalysts are excited and charges are transferred between the catalysts using redox mediators.22
25 Similarly, we reported a Zscheme for overall water splitting using a homopolymer of dibenzob,dthio
phene sulfone (P10) as the hydrogen evolution catalyst, coupled with BiVO4 acting as the oxygen evolu
tion catalyst using a Fe2Fe3 redox mediator system.26 Overall water splitting occurred, but the solar 
efficiency was very low. The use of redox mediators in Zschemes can result in limitations arising from the kinetics of diffusion to 
and from the surface of the photocatalysts, surface interactions, and charge transfer between the medi
ator and the photocatalyst.
