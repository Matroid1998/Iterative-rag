Description:
An aromatic amine used in the synthesis of N-substituted heterocycles.

Text:
A key area of amine synthesis research has been the develop
ment of new methodologies for Nalkylation to overcome issues 
intrinsic to common procedures such as reductive amination 
and the nucleophilic substitution of alkylating agents, including 
overalkylation, poor atom economy, and unsustainable rea
gents.2,3 The most widely developed of these, borrowing hydro
gen catalysis, has seen further application in the synthesis of 
saturated Nheterocycles through the Nalkylation of amines 
with terminal diols.46 These redox neutral annulation reactions 
allow for Nsubstituted heterocycles to be synthesised with wa
ter as the sole byproduct, but typically require forcing condi
tions and are largely limited in scope to benzylamine and aniline 
derivatives.
