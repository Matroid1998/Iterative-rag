Description:
Binds free metal ions via chelation to reduce lipid peroxidation.

Text:
Reactions between alkyl radicals (L)
27
and molecular oxygen generate peroxyl radicals (LOO), which
28
further accelerate lipid peroxidation by reacting with unsat
29
urated lipids. Whereas at neutral pH prooxidant iron ions
30
are strongly bound to the negatively charged phosvitin, a
31
weaker binding at the acidic pH of mayonnaise makes them
32
available as catalysts for lipid oxidation (Merkx et al., 2019). 33
Therefore, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is often
34
added to mayonnaise to bind free metal ions via chelation
35
and thus reduces the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO)
36
products (Lee and Decker, 2011; Nielsen et al., 2004).
