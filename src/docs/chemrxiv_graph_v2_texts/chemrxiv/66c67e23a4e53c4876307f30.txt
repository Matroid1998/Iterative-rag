Description:
A low value product in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode during electrolysis.

Text:
Hydrogen is a key reactant in many chemical processes (e.g., ammonia synthesis, 
hydrogenation reactions, FischerTropsch, etc. ), and it can also be used as a green fuel.1 
Water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity can produce hydrogen via the hydrogen 
evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Although promising, electrolysis technology is not 
developed enough to compete with the cost of fossil fuelderived hydrogen. Electrolysis is 
thermodynamically and kinetically limited by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the 
anode, incurring high electricity costs that cannot be offset by oxygen, a low value product.
