Description:
Less prone to protonation than the TMS ether.

We thus investigated the corresponding triethylsilyl (TES) ether 
5a, which would be less prone to protonation than the TMS ether. The catalytic reaction 
proceeded in the same manner as for the TMS ether (98 NMR yield) and the desired 
silyl fluoroenolate (6a) was isolated in 89 yield after chromatographic purification. The 
geometry of isolated 6a was determined to be Z using 1H19F heteronuclear Overhauser 
effect spectroscopy (HOESY; Scheme S3). We confirmed that the reaction also proceeded 
on the gram scale to give 2.1 g of the desired product (78 yield). With the optimized
