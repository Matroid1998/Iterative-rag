Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds, which are highly directional and used in supramolecular materials for reversible and tunable polymer formation.

Early 
supramolecular materials employed the use of the hydrogen 
bond;4 
a 
particularly 
powerful 
tool, 
which 
showcased 
reversibility and tuneability of the formed polymers that is not 
achievable with regular covalently linked polymers.5 These same 
interactions were then used to craft soft 2D materials, where the 
highly directional nature of the hydrogen bond directs the 
assembly. Similar strides have been made in the field of metal 
organic frameworks (MOFs) where incorporating directional 
coordination bonds between metal and ligand has yielded thin 2D 
layers,6,1e although the suppression of layerbylayer growth in 
the third dimension remains a challenge to this day. Despite the 
clear design approach, it is often not a sole interaction that drives 
the assembly but a combination of several which leaves much 
room for serendipity.
