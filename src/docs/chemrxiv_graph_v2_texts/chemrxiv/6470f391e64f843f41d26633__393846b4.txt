A synthetic ester found in polyvinylchloride (PVC) flooring.

Incidents of asthmalike symptoms, referred to as sick building 
syndrome (SBS), have been reported following occupant exposure to 2ethylhexanol, believed to 
be generated via hydrolysis of DEHP and DEHA found in polyvinylchloride (PVC) flooring.47 
While hydrolysis of synthetic esters (SEs)such as DEHP and DEHAis relatively slow even 
under alkaline conditions which may be present on concrete,810 the ubiquitous nature of SEs in 
the indoor environment raises concerns about the possible contribution of these pathways to poor 
indoor air quality during both acute SBS episodes and more ordinary conditions.
