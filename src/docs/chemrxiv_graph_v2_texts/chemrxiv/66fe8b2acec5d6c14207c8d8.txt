Description:
A metal that can enhance electronic properties when incorporated into gC3N4.

of foreign elements such as metals (e.g., Fe, Co) or nonmetals (e.g., S, P) into the g
C3N4 matrix effectively enhanced its electronic properties and improve charge separation.1618 For the 
nitrogen photofixation reaction the combination of gC3N4 with other materials, such as metal oxides 
or conducting polymers, through the realization of heterojunctions, can synergistically enhance 
photocatalytic activity and stability promoting good ammonia production rates.6,16,1921 Among other 
approaches, the generation of nitrogen vacancies in carbon nitride shows to be a good strategy to 
boost the nitrogen photofixation as demonstrated in recent times.
