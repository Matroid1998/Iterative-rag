Description:
Forms coordinated polyhedra with Ca2 in the described structure.

Text:
5 The struc
ture originally proposed as the most plausible, with high symmetry, is a hexagonal model
involving a helical symmetry operation, where CO3
2 groups occupy interlayer positions be
tween Ca2 sheets. In this structure, CO3
2 groups occupy alternating positions across Ca2
sheets, forming the Kamhi model with a P63mmc space group (SG).6 The lattice parame
ters are a  4.13 A and c  8.49 A. The CO3
2 groups exhibit threedimensional rotational
freedom, while Ca2 forms 6 or 7coordinated polyhedra with oxygen atoms in CO3
2. Additionally, stacking sequences of CO3
2 along the caxis can disrupt sixfold rotational
symmetry, leading to various crystal structures with reduced symmetry.

A light atom detectable in CO3 2- using advanced microscopy techniques.

Text:
Since 2010, theoretical studies using rstprinciples calculations based on density func
tional theory (DFT) and advanced imaging techniques, such as highresolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), have signicantly advanced understanding of vaterite crys
tal structures.7,8 Light atoms such as carbon and oxygen in CO3
2 can be detected using
annular brighteld and atomicresolution highangle annular dark eld (ADF) microscopy,
producing clear diraction images of microscopic regions. 7,9,10 Spectroscopic techniques, in
cluding Raman11 and 43Ca solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 12 have further
rened the understanding of vaterite structures. An excellent review summarized these nd
