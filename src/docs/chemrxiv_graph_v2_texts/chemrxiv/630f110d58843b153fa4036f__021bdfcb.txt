Dependent oxygenases essential for the regulation of many biological pathways.

Text:
. Fe(II)aketoglutarate (aKG)dependent oxygenases are essential for the regulation of 
many biological pathways, including oxygen homeostasis,1,2 DNA repair,35 and epigenetic 
inheritance.68 To perform their biological functions, Fe(II)aKGdependent enzymes have 
evolved to carry out distinct chemical transformations spanning hydroxylation911 and 
halogenation12,13 to isonitrile formation.14,15 Despite their diverse reactivities, they utilize a highly 
conserved coordination environment centered around a mononuclear highspin iron center.
