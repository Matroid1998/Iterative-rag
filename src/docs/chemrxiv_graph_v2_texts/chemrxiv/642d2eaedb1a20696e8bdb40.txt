Description:
Known for its high thermoelectrical conductivities, corrosion resistance, and antimicrobial properties.

Text:
Applying coatings 
to steel contacts can provide a route to minimise, protect and prevent the effects of friction, 
wear and corrosion within switch assemblies, which would reduce failures, in addition to 
improving energy efficiencies and lowering their environmental impact.1419 
Coppercoating of mechanical components and surfaces is commonplace in industry20 due to 
the coatings excellent chemical and physical properties imparted onto the surface of a 
component. These include; its high thermoelectrical conductivities, corrosion resistance and 
antimicrobial properties.2124 However, the application of copper coatings within contact 
mechanisms is limited due to its poor wear resistance under applied load.25 Therefore, 
improving the wear resistance of copper has become a key issue for use in highperformance 
mechanical components.
