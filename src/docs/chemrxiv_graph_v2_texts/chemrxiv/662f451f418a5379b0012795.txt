Description:
A solvent supported in hybrid physicalML modelling.

Text:
With this setup, an error of RMSE(logS) 0.7 was
obtained, which is close to the experimental accuracy of 0.71.0
log units for druglike molecules.5,24 While this work does illus
trate the advantages of hybrid physicalML modelling, it is still
somewhat restricted from a practical point of view it requires
expensive ab initio calculations, supports a limited set of solvents
(acetone, benzene, and ethanol), and requires the experimental
melting point. Vassileiou et al.25 further support the observation that hy
brid physicalML approaches lead to improved predictive per
formance. Here, the conductorlike screening model for real
solvents (COSMORS) with RMSE(logS) 1.0 is critically com
pared against machine learning on 2D descriptors (RMSE(logS) 
0.92), as well as hybrid models thereof, with hybrid models
(RMSE(logS) 0.8) giving the best results.
