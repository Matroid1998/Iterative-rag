Bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized the field of chemical 
biology by offering unparalleled precision in initiating and 
controlling molecular transformations within complex biological 
matrices.1 Among the most impactful of these methods is the 
inverse electron demand DielsAlder (IEDDA)initiated reaction 
between 1,2,4,5tetrazines (Tz) and transcyclooctenes (TCO, 
Fig. 1a).2 Due to its exceptional reaction kinetics, TzTCO click 
chemistry facilitates fast and efficient ligation even at minimal 
reactant concentrations, making it indispensable for time
sensitive in vivo applications.3 
Over the last decade, the scope of bioorthogonal chemistry has 
broadened significantly to encompass not only ligation reactions 
but also innovative strategies for bondcleavage.4 This concept 
has seen substantial development, providing reactions to trigger 
the controlled release and activation of therapeutics in targeted 
locations.
