Description:
Receptors responsible for synaptic transmission and plasticity, forming the basis of cognitive learning and memory.

At 
present, there are two types of drugs that have been approved to treat Alzheimers disease 
Cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors and NmethylDaspartate (NMDA) antagonists (Breijyeh  
Karaman, 2020). NmethylDaspartate receptors (NMDARs) have also been implicated in the 
progression of AD. These receptors are responsible for synaptic transmission and plasticity, thought 
to form the basis of cognitive learning and memory (Zhang et al., 2016). Despite their significance, 
there still needs to be an improvement in treatment strategies as the currently approved drugs do 
not or fail to target either A plaques or NFT (Gregory et al., 2021).
