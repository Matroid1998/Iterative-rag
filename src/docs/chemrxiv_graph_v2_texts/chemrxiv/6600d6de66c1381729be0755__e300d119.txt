Description:
A polymer film optimized for mechanical performance and structural integrity, suitable for biomedical applications.

Text:
The resulting 
PLLA film was cut into rectangular pieces (50x50 mm) and 
subjected to uniaxial drawing with draw ratios of 50100. After stretching, the films were thermally treated at 90C for 
8 hours and then quenched in an ice bath for 7 hours. The 
combined thermal treatment and quenching process serve to 
optimize the mechanical performance and structural 
integrity of the PLLA films, ensuring their suitability for 
various biomedical applications.
