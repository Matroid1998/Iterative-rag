Description:
The neutral form produced from the reduction of anionic PO43.

Text:
An arc furnace is used to achieve extreme temperatures 
up to 1500 C, necessary both to sufficiently soften the reactants 
and provide an entropic driving force  in the process limiting 
the coke to incomplete oxidation to CO.7 The role of SiO2 is 
less obvious but no less crucial it absorbs the oxide ions that 
(by basic laws of atom and charge conservation) must neces
sarily be generated when anionic PO43 is reduced to neutral P4.
