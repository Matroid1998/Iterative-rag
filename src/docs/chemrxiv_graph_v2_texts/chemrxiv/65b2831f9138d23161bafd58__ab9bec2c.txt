Description:
Formed by inverting upper matrix layers through the manipulation of Lewis acidity in a liquid phase.

Text:
Accumulation of Ag atoms at doping levels manipulates the energy structure of Sb2Se3 
films with the appearance of photoluminescence in the visible and nearinfrared regions, 
revealing the potential for this strategy to adjust radiative recombination pathways. Apart from 
that, stretching the Lewis acidity of auxiliary chemicals in a liquid phase enables inverting upper 
matrix layers into AgSbX2 and achieving the desired accuracy of reaction yield when converting
