Description:
An anticancer agent that is potent and selective.

Text:
Sulfamated (N(sp2)SO3) and sulfonated (C(sp2)SO3) arylated motifs are found in a variety of valuable 
commodities including sulfa dyes, sulfa drugs and bioactive molecules (Figure 1). Figure 1. Structures of bioactive sulfamated and sulfonated molecules. Examples of bioactive N(sp2)sulfamates include A) a sulfamate salt prodrug derivative of the potent and 
selective 2(4aminophenyl)benzothiazole anticancer agent; 1 B) a malonate templated sulfamic acid 
phosphotyrosine mimetic as a selective and potent inhibitor of HPTP (a protein tyrosine phosphatase); 
2 C) a glycomimetic that has protective effects against lipidinduced endothelial dysfunction, restorative 
effects on diabetic endothelial colony forming cells, and preventative effects on downstream vascular 
calcification.
