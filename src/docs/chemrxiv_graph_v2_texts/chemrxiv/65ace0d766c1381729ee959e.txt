density and subsequently its practical applications. Lithiumion batteries were commercialized 
due to the discovery of cathode chemistries like Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)3, Lithium 
manganese oxide (LiMn2O4)4 and Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)5 by Professor 
Goodenough in the 1980s and 1990s. Liion batteries also have certain fundamental advantages over traditional battery chemistries 
like NiCd, NiMh and Pbacid. Lithium has the lowest reduction potential among all of the 
elements, this in turn results in Liion batteries having the highest cell potential. Lithium is the 
third lightest element and has a small ionic radius. This results in Liion batteries having high 
gravimetric and volumetric capacity and power density.
