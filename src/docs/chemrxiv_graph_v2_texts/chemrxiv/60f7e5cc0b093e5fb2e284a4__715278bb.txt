Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for 
lowcost and longterm storage of renewable energy as their unique design allows for independent 
scaling of peak power and energy storage.1,2 Even though there are, mostly metalbased, ARFBs that 
are commercially available today, the technology still faces obstacles that impede a widespread 
deployment.36 ARFBs with organic active materials are progressively being investigated because of 
their rich structural diversity that relate to tunable properties and raw material abundance that relate to 
production scaleup.7,8 A promising family of electroactive materials for ARFBs is the quinonelike 
cyclic dione compounds,913 which possess high electrochemical and chemical tunability11,14 as well 
as rapid redox kinetics.911,15 Quinones are found to occur naturally16 and are also mass produced for 
application in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.17,18 
The battery relevant properties of quinones, including redox potential, solubility, and stability, 
need improvements for the future commercial use of these compounds.8,19,20 To this end, a number of 
recent studies have employed highthroughput virtual screening (HTVS) methods to partially explore 
the vast chemical space of quinones, which were derived mostly from cyclohexadiene and its fused 
derivatives, such as benzoquinones (1ring), naphthoquinones (2rings), anthraquinones (3rings),2125 
or from naturally occurring quinones.26 The HTVS approach generally begins with creation of a 
comprehensive virtual library of candidate molecules.
