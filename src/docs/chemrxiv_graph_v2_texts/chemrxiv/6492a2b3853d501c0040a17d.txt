Description:
A biocompatible conducting polymer with promising features for biomedical applications due to its optical transparency, chemical stability, and cytocompatibility.

Since their discovery in 1977, conducting polymers (CPs) have become highly 
appealing materials for a wide range of uses. These applications span across diverse fields 
including sensors1, capacitators2, solar cells3, drug delivery4, and wound dressing5. Especially, 
biocompatible CPs such as polyaniline (PANI)6, polypyrrole7, polythiophene8, and poly (3,4
ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)9, 10 displayed promising features for biomedical utilizations. This is primarily due to their optical transparency, chemical stability, and cytocompatibility. Among the stated CPs, particularly, PEDOT based materials have gained considerable 
attention in recent the decade due to their remarkable resistance to oxidation, low intrinsic 
cytotoxicity, and good mechanical strength11. These distinctive features have positioned 
PEDOTs as an attractive candidate for the fabrication of biodegradable and electroconductive 
polymers, particularly in the field of tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds1217.
