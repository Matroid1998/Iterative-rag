The growing concern over global warming and its detrimental effects on the environment has 
intensified the search for sustainable solutions to address the issue of CO2 emissions. 13 The primary 
contributor to global warming is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases significant amounts of CO2 into 
the atmosphere.48 To secure a sustainable future for generations to come and protect the environment, 
modern society has a crucial responsibility to restore the natural balance. This entails closing the 
anthropogenic carbon cycle and establishing a sustainable energy flow. To mitigate the impact of CO2 
emissions, one approach is the electrification of the transportation sector, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuelpowered vehicles. The metalCO2 batteries offer a promising avenue for the valorization of CO2 
through producing green electricity.
