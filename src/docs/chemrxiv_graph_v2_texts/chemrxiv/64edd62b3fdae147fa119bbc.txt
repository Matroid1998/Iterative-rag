Description:
A monovalent cation that can be exchanged with protons across cellular membranes.

Text:
NaH exchangers (NHEs) are vital for controlling the intracellular pH by shuffling protons 
(H) across the cellular membranes in exchange for monovalent cations, such as sodium (Na), 
lithium (Li) and potassium (K).1, 2 There are 10 isoforms of NHEs (NHE1  NHE10).1, 3 hNHE1 
(the human form of NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed integral transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein 
present in all cells. It controls the electroneutral exchange of a single intracellular H for an 
extracellular Na ion (11 stoichiometry) across the plasma membrane, acting to elevate 
intracellular pH (pHi).
