Description:
Capable of water splitting under UV light irradiation.

For 
the above mentioned reasons, the metal nano clusters 
have attracted much attention as new functional nano
material and promising candidates for various applica
tions in the science and technology like catalysis, pho
toluminescence, biomedical and magnetism.1114 In pho
to catalysis, the nano clusters were found to be promis
ing compared to their bulk counterparts.1518 In the 
1970s, Fujishima and Honda discovered that water split
ting could occur over titanium dioxide (TiO) under UV 
light irradiation, which sparked intense research in the 
fields of photocatalysis, photovoltaics and sensors. TiO 
has a bandgap of 3.03.2 eV, which limits its ability to 
absorb light only in the UV region of the spectrum.
