Description:
Used in highly stereocontrolled additions to aldehydes.

Text:
The synthesis of chiral secondary alcohols has been a sub
ject of intense study for more than 40 years (Figure 1A).1 
Retrosynthetically, two main pathways to access arylalkyl 
substituted secondary alcohols employ either nucleophilic 
addition to an aldehyde2 or asymmetric reduction3 of the 
corresponding ketone. Early catalytic manifestations of the 
former process date back to the work of Noyori4 on highly 
stereocontrolled 
organozinc 
additions 
to 
aldehydes 
whereas the latter strategy originated from the findings of 
Landor5 ultimately leading to modern methods such as the 
venerable CBS6 reduction.
