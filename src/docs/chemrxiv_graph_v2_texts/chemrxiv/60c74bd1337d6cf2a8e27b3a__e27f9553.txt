perature. While several aspects of isobutanol combustion chemistry
have been studied in detail, such as the initial hydrogen ab
straction by OH13 and the oxidation of its smaller oxidation
products,14 accurate pressuredependent kinetics of peroxy
radicals formed in isobutanol combustion has not been fully
developed nor incorporated into detailed models. This is in
spite of some isobutanol studies showing that ignition delay
is sensitive to peroxy radical reactions.8,10 Given the sensi
tivity of this fuel to equivalence ratio and pressure,5 the for
mation and fate of peroxy radicals can signicantly impact
ignition timing and multistage heat release.12,15 Peroxy rad
ical chemistry is also expected to control the environmental
fate of isobutanol emitted into the environment, since peroxy
radicals are also key intermediates in atmospheric degradation
processes.
