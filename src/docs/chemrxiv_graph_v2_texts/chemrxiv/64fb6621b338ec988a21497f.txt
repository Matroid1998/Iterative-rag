Description:
Forms longer chains at the aposition in bicyclic styrene-derived products.

Text:
of longer 
carbon chains at the aposition (4l,m), bicyclic styrenederived 
products were obtained (4np), which would be difficult to access 
through other synthetic means. Products bearing naphthyl (4q) or 
pyridyl (4r) groups instead of the phenyl group were prepared, and 
an a,adiaryl product was also obtained (4s). A vinyl acetatetype 
substrate was employed in the reaction to afford an aOsubstituted 
product (4t), albeit with a reduced yield. A dienecontaining sub
strate successfully furnished the amethylacinnamyl product 
along with EZ isomerization of the cinnamyl moiety (4u).
