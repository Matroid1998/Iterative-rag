Description:
An AIDF emitter containing a 1,8 naphthalimide acceptor.

Although these selfassembled 
NPs show good biocompatibility, photostability, and water dispersibility, the authors did not 
demonstrate their TADF properties nor provide any TRFI studies. 3) Aggregationinduced delayed 
fluorescence (AIDF).7 The quenching of the emission by oxygen can be suppressed due to its limited 
ability to make physical contact with the emitter in the aggregated state. Qi et al. reported the use of 
three AIDF emitters, PXZNI, PTZNI and lysosometargeting LysoPXZNI, each containing a 1,8
naphthalimide (NI) acceptor.7b In aqueous solutions that produced the aggregated form, all three 
TADF materials demonstrated markedly enhanced delayed fluorescence when concentrations were 
increased. Subsequently, confocal fluorescence and lifetime imaging studies were performed using 
laser scanning microscopy and TRFI.
