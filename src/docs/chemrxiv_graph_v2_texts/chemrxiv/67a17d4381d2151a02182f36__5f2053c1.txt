Description:
Used in all-solid electrolyte composites for lithium metal batteries.

Text:
For example, the electrolyte mixture of PEO (molecular 
weight, MW  600,000) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) forms large crystalline 
domains at ambient temperature,45, 79 resulting in relatively low ionic conductivity (105 S cm1, about 3 
orders of magnitude lower than the commonly used electrolytes consisting of organic carbonates and 
lithium salts).5 
To solve this problem, there have been efforts spent on changing the polymer architectures to reduce 
the crystallinity of PEObased electrolytes and to increase their ionic conductivity at room temperature.10
20 In particular, starshaped polymers with a core and several polymeric arms have been demonstrated to be 
effective (Figure 1).10, 12 Some recent developments of star polymer electrolytes include a study 
demonstrating the impact of polymer architectures (linear to comblike to bottlebrush star) on the thermal 
and conduction properties of PEObased electrolytes,15 an allsolid electrolyte composite for lithium metal 
batteries consists of PEO and polycaprolactone star copolymers,11 a hyperbranched PEOderived star 
polymer with improved ionic conductivity and mechanical strength,14 a star block copolymer with comb
like arms showing improved ionic conductivity,13 and many other examples.
