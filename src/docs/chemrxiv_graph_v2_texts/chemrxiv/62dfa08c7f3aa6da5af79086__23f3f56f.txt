Description:
A semiconductor material used in the study of buried interfaces.

Text:
However, inevitably, the buried interfaces inside IIIV semiconductor devices are not 
straightforward to characterize with modern surface science methods.10 As a firstofitskind 
study of the relevant AlInPGaInP (100) interface11,12 we present here an experimental 
investigation by Tapered CrossSection Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TCSPES) of GaInP(100) 
grown on Ge(100) and GaAs(100) substrates.
