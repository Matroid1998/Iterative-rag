Description:
A highly activated electrophile used in covalent probe creation.

Text:
It can not only 
identify ligandable binding sites in the vicinity of a binding pocket, 
but can also facilitate an understanding of natural protein functions 
and the biological properties of small molecules15. To create a 
covalent probe, a highly activated electrophile such as an N
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)16, sulfotetrafluorophenyl (STP) ester17, 
alkyloxyacyl 
imidazole18, 
tosylate19 
or 
NacylNalkyl
