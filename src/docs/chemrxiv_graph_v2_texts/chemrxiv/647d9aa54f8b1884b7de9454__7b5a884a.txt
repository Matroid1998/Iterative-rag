Description:
Involved in the catalytic cycle of histidine kinases via a phosphorylated histidyl residue.

Text:
Histidine kinases catalytic cycle proceeds via a phosphorylated 
histidyl residue in the active site (Figure 1a).11 The kinetic sta
bility of KSTA compounds ensures that the chemical potential 
held within the molecule is not dissipated in deleterious side re
actions. This is exemplified by the kinetic stability of ATP 
which has a hydrolysis halflife of 2 years at 25 C and pH 8.12 
This strategy of using KSTA compounds with enzyme catalysts 
is key to directing reaction outcomes in cellular biochemical 
networks. We recently reported a prebiotically plausible kinetically sta
ble and thermodynamically activated ATP analogue in the form 
of imidazole phosphate.13 Imidazole phosphate forms under the 
mildest of conditions (pH 7.3, 22 C) from a solution of cyanate, 
orthophosphate and imidazole.

drive vesicle growth via SerHis localising inside the membrane 
of vesicles and catalysing the formation of a hydrophobic di
peptide.23 SerHis can catalyse the formation of oligonucleo
tides starting from imidazoleactivated nucleotides.24 Histidyl 
containing cyclic peptides catalyse also the hydrolysis of pyro
phosphate.25 Histidine may also ligate metals e.g. Zn2 to form 
complexes that catalyse depsipeptide oligomerisation.26 In our 
aforementioned physicochemical orthophosphate cycle, we hy
pothesized that a histidyl peptide could serve as a catalyst for
