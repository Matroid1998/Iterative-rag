Recent years have seen a vast expansion in the coordination chemistry of ptertbutylcalix4arene 
(H4TBC4), particularly in relation to the synthesis of polynuclear 3d, 4f, and 3d4f clusters that display a 
range of fascinating physical properties (e.g. single molecule magnetism and magnetic refrigeration).1 The 
calix4arene (C4) scaffold is an extremely attractive ligand in this regard as it can be synthesised and 
modified with relative ease, but also because it is predisposed to bind a series of metal ions in the 
polyphenolic pocket. Furthermore, the conformational properties of C4s are wellunderstood, particularly 
when the lowerrim comprises only hydroxyl groups, and these molecules can form cone, partialcone, 1,2
alternate and 1,3alternate conformers.2 These conformations can also be accessed through the introduction 
of small substituents at the lowerrim (e.g.
