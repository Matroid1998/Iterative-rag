Description:
Studied in solid host systems using 13C NMR to observe chemical shift dependencies.

Text:
For the study of carbon dioxide in solid host systems, 13C NMR can be an immensely powerful 
tool.14 The chemical shift () of any nucleus per se depends, besides on the structural 
environment within the molecular structure also on the orientation of the molecule with respect 
to the external magnetic field. In ideal solutions, this orientational dependence is averaged out 
() due to rapid movement of the species under investigation. This is the reason for the 
characteristically narrow lines observed in solution NMR experiments. In contrast, this 
averaging of the chemical shift does not occur in solid state NMR experiments. In these, the 
species movement is mostly slower and therefore the anisotropy of the measured signal is 
retained.
