Description:
A gas that poses storage challenges at operational temperatures, impacting its commercial viability in applications like transportation.

Text:
Storing hydrogen at operational temperatures poses a significant challenge to its commercial
viability, particularly in applications such as transportation. The U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) has set ambitious targets for hydrogen storage by 2025, including achieving 5.5 weight
percent (wt ) and 40 g L1 at 233358 K, with an ultimate target of 6.5 wt  and 50 g
L1.1 Additionally, during the DOEs Hydrogen Shot summit in 2021, a further goal was
announced to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to 1 per 1 kg within the next decade.2
To achieve these targets, it is evident that materialsbased approaches are preferred.

Description:
A gas that can be stored using adsorbents like MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) and CovalentOrganic Frameworks (COFs) to improve gas uptakes.

Text:
Rather
than attempting to compress or cryogenically cool hydrogen storage tanks, adsorbents such
as MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) and CovalentOrganic Frameworks (COFs) can be
introduced to the vessel, improving gas uptakes without incurring high utility costs. Of these
adsorbents, COFs show particular promise due to their high surface area and composition
of lighter, more abundant elements compared to MOFs.35
While many MOFs can offer high uptakes, operating at cryogenic temperature (77 K)
swings to ambient conditions (298 K) is often prohibitively expensive. To make the process
more economical, it is preferable to perform the adsorption process at ambient conditions.
