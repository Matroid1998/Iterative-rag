Description:
A fully epitaxial architecture between isostructural materials with outstanding optoelectronic properties.

Such heterostructures might still be 
useful if the target functionality is insensitive to the nature of the interface, as is the case for 
protective oxide shells.14,15 However, heterostructures expressing electronic, magnetic, and 
optical properties that arise from quantum interactions at the junction may be impaired.1625 
To express their full potential, such heterostructures require epitaxial interfaces that ensure a 
precise matching between the two materials, and can grow virtually defectfree. Indeed, the 
most successful colloidal heterostructures are fully epitaxial architectures between isostructural 
materials (e.g., CdSeCdS, CdSeZnSe, InPZnS),2,2629 which combine outstanding 
optoelectronic properties with a simple and predictable growth process.
