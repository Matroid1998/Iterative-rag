Description:
Used as a liquid agent in reactions.

Text:
Reactions were done in a mixer mill for 3 h at 35 Hz with five 5 mm diameter
PTFE balls in a 25 ml steel vessel with 10 mol of catalyst, with 1 g K3PO4 as
bulk material and  0.6 l mg1 toluene as liquid agent. For the direct
mechanochemical approach a 25 ml coated steel vessel were used. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024bcf3x ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000287787816 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
