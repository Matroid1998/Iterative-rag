Description:
An abundant and low-cost element used in sodium-ion batteries.

The global demand for efficient, sustainable, and affordable energy storage systems has intensified 
the search for alternatives to traditional lithiumion batteries.1 Consequently, sodiumion batteries 
(SIB) have garnered considerable attention as a viable solution due to the abundance and low cost 
of sodium resources, along with the potential for safe, largescale deployment. Another advantage 
of the Naion battery is that aluminiun (lighter and cheaper) can be used as a current collector. More importantly, they can be stored at low state of charge, which is unlike detrimental to the life 
of Liion batteries.2 However, Naion battery performance is often limited by challenges associated 
with sluggish ion diffusion and lower energy density compared to lithiumbased systems.3 To 
overcome these limitations, many approaches are being adapted.
