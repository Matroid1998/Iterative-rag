Description:
Forms dianionic complexes with rare earth elements.

This ensures kinetic stability of the corresponding 
dianionic rareearth complexes, in accordance with the 
previously postulated criteria for the design of stable rare
earth organometallic compounds.11 The current research on 
rareearth dianionic complexes and particular on the Ln3
L2 interaction is predominantly focused on studies of 
complexes Ln3X22L2 and similar ones (where X is an 
auxiliary monoanionic ligand). This includes rareearth 
complexes 
containing 
dianions 
of 
anthracene 
and 
naphtahalene.9, 10, 1219 Such complexes can be regarded as 
ion triplets, where the dianon L2 formally serves as two 
separate monoanions and displays bridging coordination 
modes. However, less studied mononuclear systems of the 
XLn3L2 or M(solv)nX2Ln3L2 types (where M is Na or 
K) 13, 2026 should be of much greater interest.

Description:
Forms dianions used in organolanthanide chemistry.

Additionally, these compounds are expected to display 
distinct reactivity that is comparable to that of frustrated 
Lewis pairs, such as the activation of CH, HH, and multiple 
CC bonds. Moreover, the mentioned FLPlike rareearth 
naphtalenide15, 3134 and anthracenide3436 compounds have 
been found to perform twoelectron reduction of organic 
and inorganic substrates. There is only one known case of 
using rareearth anthracenide complexes of a conjectural 
formula Ln(C14H10)(DME)n (Ln  Sm, Yb) to catalyze the 
ethylene polymerization,37 but the used complexes have not 
been isolated as individual compounds; their structures and 
properties remain unidentified. Although the anthracene dianion was introduced to 
organolanthanide chemistry three decades ago,3, 9, 25, 38 its 
rareearth complexes are still poorly studied.
