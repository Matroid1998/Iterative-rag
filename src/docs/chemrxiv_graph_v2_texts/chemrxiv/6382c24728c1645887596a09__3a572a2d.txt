Description:
Involved in the 42 cycloaddition with aromatic imines for the synthesis of multiply substituted quinolines.

Text:
Quinoline is an important natural heterocycle with a structural framework which is common to various bioactive molecules1, 2. As shown in 
Fig. 1, multiply substituted quinolines serve as privileged scaffolds in many synthetic therapeutics with a wide array of physiological attributes 
as potential anticancer37, antiviral8, 9, antifibrotic10, antimalarial1114, and antiinflammatory drugs1518. Moreover, polysubstituted quinolines 
have unique applications as agrochemicals (pyrroloquinoline quinone)19, electroluminescent materials (8hydroxyquinoline)2022, and 
dyestuffs (quinoline yellow)23. To date, the methods proposed for the synthesis of multiply substituted quinolines include the 42 
cycloaddition of aromatic imines and methyl propiolate, cyclisation of 2aminobenzaldehyde and cyclohexane1,3dione, etc., or substitution 
reactions on existing quinoline scaffolds (Scheme 1). However, these methods have disadvantages, such as expensive and dangerous 
materials, nongreen solvents, multistep process, and high temperature.

Description:
A toxic, corrosive, and highly irritating compound.

Text:
For example, the method of Xiaochen Ji et al uses nobel metal 
palladium and methyl acrylate, which is toxic and stinky24, 25. As far as Mandeep Kaurs method is concerned, bimetallic AuFe3O4 Nano
Hybrid is expensive, and methyl propiolate is toxic, corrosive and highly irritating26. CF3ynones is not a cheap and easily available reagent, 
and its preparation usually requires a complex process27. The method of J. Zeng et al need to use Grignard reagent and Ti(OEt)4, which are 
hazardous and moisture sensitivity28. The method of Masayuki Wasa et al needs high temperature and uses noble metal Pd0 and PCy2tBu
HBF4, the latter is skin corrosive irritant29.
