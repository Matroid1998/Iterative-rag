Description:
Standard electrophilic partner in MBH reactions.

Text:
The scope of the olefinic partner in MBH reaction have been thor
oughly investigated, covering a wide range of electron withdrawing groups, as well as other related substrate classes, e.g., 
alkynes and allenes.3 Conversely, in the majority of the reported MBH variants the electrophilic partners are confined to the 
standard carbonyl or imine derivatives, with only a handful of exceptions, such as Michael acceptors (RauhutCurrier reac
tion1g,4), allyl and alkyl halides, or epoxides.5
