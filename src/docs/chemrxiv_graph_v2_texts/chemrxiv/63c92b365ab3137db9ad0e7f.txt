Description:
Used for temperature calibration under pressure with well-established melting points.

Text:
. Melting of phosphorus in the 28 GPa pressure range was studied in situ by electrical resistivity 
measurements in a toroidtype highpressure apparatus with a specially designed hightemperature 
cell 11. The cell was pressurecalibrated using roomtemperature phase transitions in Bi (2.55 and 
7.7 GPa), PbSe (4.2 GPa), and PbTe (5.2 GPa). The temperature calibration under pressure was 
performed using wellestablished melting points of silicon, sodium and caesium chlorides, platinum 
and NiMnC ternary eutectic. A sample was placed directly into a graphite heater, and electrical 
resistivity of the cell was measured at different pressures upon stepwise heating up to the melting
