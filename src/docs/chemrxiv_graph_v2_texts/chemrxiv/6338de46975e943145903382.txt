Description:
A monovalent cation that can be exchanged in sodium ion conductors.

Text:
This fast sodium ion conductor contains onedimensional tunnels (diameter 2.5) 
serving as pathways for sodiumion transport in a monoclinic crystal system 27,28. These 
channels are large enough to make the NZGO an excellent sodium ion conductor and additionally 
a good candidate for ion exchange for other monovalent cations such as K!, Li!, and Ag! possibly
