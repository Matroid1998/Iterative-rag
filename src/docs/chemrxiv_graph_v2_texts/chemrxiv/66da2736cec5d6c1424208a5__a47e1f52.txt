Description:
A component of the Arizona solvent system L1 used in liquid-liquid chromatography.

CPC is
consequently referred to as a liquidliquid chromatographic technique given its conceptual sim
ilarity to chromatography methods that utilize a solid stationary phase. Recently, CPC (and a
similar method, countercurrent chromatography) has shown promise as an effective and scalable
approach for separating bioproduct mixtures to advance the renewable chemical industry.15,17,18
Alherech et al.15 successfully employed a twostage CPC strategy for isolating five aromatic prod
ucts from the alkaline oxidative depolymerization of CuAHP lignin by utilizing solvent mix
tures comprising pentaneethyl acetatemethanolwater (i.e., Arizona solvent system L1) and
dichloromethanemethanolwater.

Description:
A component of the Arizona solvent systems, used in quaternary mixtures with varied polarity.

Text:
High product purity (i.e.,
high selectivity between products) requires solvent systems that lead to product log10 Kp values
that are sufficiently different from each other, which can be difficult to achieve for chemically sim
ilar products. CPC poses an additional constraint by requiring that log10 Kp values lie within a
1The socalled Arizona solvent systems consist of quaternary mixtures of water, methanol, ethyl acetate, and
alkane solvents systematically varied polarity, labeled A (most polar) to Z (least polar).18
