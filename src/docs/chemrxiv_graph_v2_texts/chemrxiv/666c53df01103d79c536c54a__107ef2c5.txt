Involved in bioconjugation studies.

Text:
Klmel and Kool prepared 
a comprehensive review covering hydrazone and oxime bioconjugation studies.35 While much useful 
information on relative reactivity and trends can be obtained from this seminal body of work, how 
reactivity measured in model studies translates to the reactivity of more complex polymeric systems 
and materials remains unclear. Additionally, while some existing covalent network models have been 
adapted to represent the reversible nature of dynamic boronic acid ester crosslinks,36,37 and more 
recently MarcoDufort et al. studied the relationship between RECs and macroscopic mechanics in 
telechelic boronic acid ester hydrogels,9 we lack distinct network models for dynamic networks 
composed of reversible junctions. In this work, we aim to build upon the structurereactivity relationship that imines display with 
their component amines and aldehydes (Figure 1).
