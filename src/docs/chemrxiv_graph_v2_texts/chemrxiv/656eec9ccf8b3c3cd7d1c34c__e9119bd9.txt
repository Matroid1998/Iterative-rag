Description:
A fluorescent dye used in studies of oxidation in triglyceride emulsion droplets.

Text:
For example, a recent publication using BODIPY 665676 showed that oxidation in medium chain 
21 
triglyceride (saturated fatty acids) emulsion droplets occurred faster when cooxidizing unsaturated oil droplets 
22 
were present.14 This may indicate that lipid oxidation can spread from oxidizing droplets to nonoxidized ones or 
23 
that oxidizing droplets influence each other.

Description:
A fluorophore used to monitor local changes in fluorescence related to lipid oxidation in emulsions.

Text:
A different study using the same fluorophore showed, however, that 
24 
when lipid oxidation is selectively initiated in a single droplet, the oxidation does not spread rapidly to neighboring 
25 
droplets.18 Recently, we used BODIPY 665676 to show that the formulation of the emulsions determined the 
26 
effect of droplet size on lipid oxidation in an OW emulsion with a high oil concentration, such as mayonnaise.16 
27 
In that study, we combined information from monitoring local changes in BODIPY 665676 fluorescence with 
28 
local protein autofluorescence at the singledroplet level. Despite much ambiguity in the literature on the role of
