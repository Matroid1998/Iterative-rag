Description:
A small molecule involved in binding to the histamine H1 receptor.

We find that these characteristics enhance the 
predictive ability of machine learning methods to predict molecular properties. The MACAW 
generative approach, based on these embeddings, can provide molecules with prespecified 
properties without the need for the expertise and time needed to train neural networks. The application of MACAW is demonstrated for property prediction, virtual screening, and 
inverse molecular design. MACAW embeddings are used for the prediction of complex 
properties, including research octane number (RON), cetane number (CN), melting point (MP) 
and flash point (FP) of molecules, as well as the binding of small molecules to the histamine 
H1 receptor and the muscarinic M2 receptor. These properties are demonstrative of both 
biofuel and medicinal applications.

Description:
A molecule that binds strongly to the histamine H1 receptor.

Text:
We also demonstrate the use of MACAW embeddings in 
virtual screening the rapid embedding and prediction of properties for tens of thousands of 
molecules enables the identification of molecules that bind strongly to the histamine H1 
receptor but weakly to the muscarinic M2 receptor. Furthermore, MACAW embeddings can 
help recommend molecules with prespecified properties (inverse design problem). For this, 
we propose a directed evolution strategy in silico that involves a novel probabilistic molecular 
generator. This inverse design method avoids the need for the expertise and time to train a 
complex decoder network and is wellsuited to the dynamic nature of MACAW embeddings.
