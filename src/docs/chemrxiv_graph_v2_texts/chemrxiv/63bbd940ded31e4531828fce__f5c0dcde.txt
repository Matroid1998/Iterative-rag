Description:
Used in NaPBAs which deliver excellent cathode performance for NIBs.

Text:
As a result, Na
PBAs have delivered some of the best cathode performance for NIBs so far.1013 Interestingly, 
bigger Kfilled PBAs (KPBAs), with a similar formula KxMFe(CN)61yzH2O, was initially 
studied as cathode materials for Kion batteries (KIBs),1416 but have also been demonstrated 
to be appealing cathode materials for NIBs,1720 delivering a comparable capacity to NaPBAs. It has been speculated that using KPBAs as cathodes for NIBs is an attractive approach 
because compared with Na, the bigger K can better fit the large interstitial voids in the PBA 
framework, enabling higher structural stability.14, 17, 21 
In a hybrid battery system containing two cation species, where K residues in a KPBA 
cathode and Na is present in the electrolyte, cation intercalation mechanism has been elusive.

Description:
Gradually replaces K in following intercalation processes.

Text:
It is empirically expected that K would be extracted from the PBA framework after initial 
deintercalation, and Na would gradually replace K in following intercalation processes, 
which essentially transforms a KPBA cathode to a NaPBA cathode. Such kind of NaK
