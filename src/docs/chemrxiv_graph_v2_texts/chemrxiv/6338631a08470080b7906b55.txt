Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds in water, leading to a multitude of possible configurations and energies.

On the other hand, MD 
incorporates kinetic energy, and is therefore 
able to move away from metastable states 
and escape local depressions of the potential 
energy surface; however, this comes at the 
cost of having an unsatisfactory handling of 
chemical reactivity because MD generally 
has no dynamic knowledge of electronic 
structure. With

ABSTRACT 
Hydrogen bonded water has a multitude of possible configurations and energies. By treating 
networks of hydrogen bonded water molecules as directed graphs, and by using a program 
for reversing cycles in the graphs, significant portions of the energy terrain can be 
systematically mapped out with relative ease. Configurations that are mutual cycle reversals 
of each other, or hydrogen bonding families, are observed to have similar energies.
