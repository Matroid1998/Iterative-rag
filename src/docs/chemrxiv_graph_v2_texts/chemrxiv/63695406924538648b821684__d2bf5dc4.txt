Description:
Undergo catalytic CH alumination at the 2-position.

Text:
For 
example, catalytic CH alumination of benzofuran, furans, and dihydropyrans was found to occur 
exclusively in the 2position using 1 as a reagent and Pd(PCy3)2 as a catalyst.13 These 2metallated 
heterocycles are only kinetic products as they converted to ringexpanded aluminacycle at longer 
reaction times (Figure 1). To the best of our knowledge there is limited precedent for this type of 
reaction in CH borylation methodology, although 2borylated and 2silylated furans have been shown 
to convert to ring expanded products under specialised conditions.14,15 The ringexpanded 
aluminacycles 3 are potentially useful synthetic intermediates.
