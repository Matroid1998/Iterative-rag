Description:
Exhibits open metal site centers in MOFs, facilitating a cooperative carbon monoxide adsorption mechanism via spin transition.

Text:
Metalorganic frameworks (MOF) are nanoporous materials
made of metal ion centers coordinated by organic linkers to
form 3Dstructures 1,2 that have attracted much attention for
catalysis, 36 sensing 6,7 and gas capture and separation. 8,9 In
these materials, efficient and selective gas adsorption can be
achieved due to the large internal surface area and the high
affinity of the metal centers with certain gas molecules. 10
The presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, 11
also called openmetal sites, has resulted in large gas uptake
at low pressure 12,13 owing to the formation of selectively
strong 14,15 coordination bonds between the MOF and the
guest molecules. 16,17 Recently, a cooperative carbon monox
ide adsorption mechanism via spintransition has been re
ported in MOFs exhibiting openmetal site Fe centers.

Description:
Undergoes a spin-state transition from high spin to low spin as a function of CO partial pressure.

18 Ex
ceptionally large working capacities 19 and low regeneration
energies were obtained as a result of a stepshaped isotherm
resulting from a cooperative change in the gas binding prop
erties upon electronic transition. The spinstate transition
from high spin (HS) to low spin (LS) occurred as a function
of the CO partial pressure, as a result of the strong ligand
field induced by CO upon adsorption. Once the HSLS
is triggered at all Fe centers, the uptake is shown to in
crease abruptly as a consequence of the significantly larger
CO binding energy expected at LS compared to HS.
