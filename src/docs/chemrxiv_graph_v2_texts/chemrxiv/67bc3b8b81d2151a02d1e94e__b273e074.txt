Description:
An electron-accepting group used in multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters.

Text:
Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MRTADF) emitters have garnered 
considerable attention due to their potential to deliver wide color gamut and highresolution displays 
based on organic lightemitting diode (OLED) technology.1 These molecules have a distinct molecular 
structure characterized by the incorporation of alternativelypositioned electronaccepting (e.g., boron 
or ketone) and electrondonating (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) groups that are embedded within planar and 
rigid fused polycyclic aromatic structure.2 This distinctive framework effectively separates the frontier 
molecular orbitals (FMOs) involved in the emissive excited state, relying on complementary mesomeric 
behavior of the electron acceptor and electron donor motifs.1d, 3 Consequently, there is a moderately 
small singlettriplet splitting energy (EST) to trigger the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process 
that enables TADF.
