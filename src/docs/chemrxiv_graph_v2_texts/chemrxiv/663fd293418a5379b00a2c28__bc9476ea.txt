Description:
A component of air pollution formed from the reaction of CO emissions and other pollutants, posing health risks.

The resultant global 
warming, as highlighted in reports like the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports (AR4 and AR5) by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has severe implications for human society, 
ranging from extreme weather events to rising sea levels (Isfat and Raihan, 2022). Secondly, CO emissions also play a significant role in exacerbating air pollution, particularly in 
urban areas characterized by high population density and intense vehicular traffic. The combustion 
of fossil fuels in vehicles and industrial processes releases CO into the atmosphere, contributing to 
the formation of groundlevel ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), both of which pose serious 
health risks (Komolafe et al., 2014).
