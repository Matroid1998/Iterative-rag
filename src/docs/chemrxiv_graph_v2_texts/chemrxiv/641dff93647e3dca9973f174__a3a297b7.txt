Description:
Polymers from which tin-based compounds are difficult and costly to remove.

Text:
Tinbased 
catalysts are another class of popular and effective catalysts for the synthesis of polyurethanes 789. One commonly used example is dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) 10, which is also used for the synthesis 
of polyesters 1112 and many other elastomers, especially for coating applications 13. However, 
tinbased compounds are also toxic (with toxicity threshold of 3 ppm 14), and thus they are also 
difficult and costly to remove from many polymers, including poly(urethaneamides) 14,15, 
polyurethanes 13 or polylactides 16. Therefore, there is a need to develop new and nontoxicor at 
least less toxiccompounds for the synthesis of polymers and polymer networks, especially for food 
packaging or the medical industry.
