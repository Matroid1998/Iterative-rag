Description:
Important in catalyst activation.

Text:
The average molecular weight and presumably the molecular 
weight distribution of hydrolytic MAO (hMAO)15 is known to be 
important in metallocene catalyst activation. Low MW species 
such as (Me2AlOAlMe2)n (n  3 to 4)16 are known to be 
ineffective,17 while early synthetic methods emphasize the 
formation of higher MW material as confirmed through 
cryoscopic measurements.18 Cryoscopic measurements of 
commercial hMAO (W. R. Grace)19 suggest a (number) average 
MW () of ca. 1100 g mol1 while small angle neutron 
scattering (SANS) studies of hMAO (ChemturaLanxess) 
suggest a higher (weight) average MW () of 1803  55 g mol
1 with a spread in values of between 1400  2800 g mol1 
depending on free Me3Al content ( 1803 corresponds to ca.

75 of total Me3Al content for the sample in question).20 The 
same study suggested a roughly spherical shape for bulk MAO 
based upon rg  9.3 and rH 11.7  as measured by SANS and 
PGSE NMR, respectively. Both estimates were in good 
agreement with earlier studies of T1 relaxation (rg  9.7 )21 and 
metallocene ionpair size (rH  1212.5 ) by PGSE NMR.22 
However, interpretation of the PGSE NMR data in terms of 
aluminoxane molar mass (5060 Al atoms for MAO20 vs. 150
200 Al atoms for the ionpair22) differed significantly between 
the two studies.
