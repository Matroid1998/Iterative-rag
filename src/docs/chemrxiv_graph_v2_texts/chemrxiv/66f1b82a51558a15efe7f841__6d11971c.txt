Description:
Involved in complexation in nitric acid solution, forming UO22nitrate complexes.

Text:
Solution chemistry involving the uranyl ion (UO22) and its interactions with the 
surrounding molecules in aqueous environments is important for research in nuclear waste 
management, environmental remediation, and heavy element separations1. Speciation effects on 
UO22 in solution is a multifaceted problem that is still not completely understood. The 
complexation of UO22 in nitric acid solution has been explored 2, 3 where the lowpH 
environment results in the formation of UO22nitrate complexes. However, the equilibrium of 
these complexes in solution can be impacted by many factors. The introduction of additional 
molecules, both as electrolytes and coordinating ligands in solution leads to a variety of physical 
and chemical interactions with UO22 that are difficult to predict.

Description:
Interacts with solute molecules to form ionpairs or other ion-ion interactions.

Text:
To effectively use uranyl luminescence for monitoring 
processes we must understand the mechanisms by which UO22 interacts with other solute 
molecules, particularly cations that may facilitate the formation of ionpairs or other ionion 
interactions. Tetramethylammonium (TMA) has been shown to uniquely modify UO22 speciation in 
solution, presumably through the formation of ionpair complexes. Hydrolysis experiments of 
UO22 can be challenging to perform because, under alkaline conditions, insoluble uranyl 
hydroxide salts begin to form. However, TMA was found to be an effective supporting 
electrolyte in solution as its presence inhibited the formation of insoluble uranyl salts6. Clark et 
al. used this interaction between UO22 and TMA to spectroscopically characterize larger uranyl 
hydroxide species (UO2(OH)n2n(n  4, 5))7.
