Description:
A basic component of bioceramics and piezoceramics.

Biomaterials typically are used in medical fields as compatibility issues with biological cells are 
taken care of 1 3. Bioceramics out of all is the most sought biomaterial which can be also in the 
form of composites 47. Bioinert ceramics, bioactive ceramics, bioresorbable ceramics, and 
piezoceramics are the four main categories of bioceramic materials. There are a lot of dental uses, 
bioinert implant surgery, and pharmaceutical applications of bio materials 8. The basic components of bioceramics and piezoceramics are alumina or hydroxyapatite (HAp), a 
calcium phosphate. The calcium phosphate given as Ca 10 (PO4)6 (OH)2, is the main substance 
in natural bone. They are used to replace missing bone and can adhere to the bone and encourage 
bone development.
