Description:
Forms tetrahedra where each In atom is fourfold coordinated by As atoms, cornershared along the c axis.

While most Zintl pnictides are known to show ptype polarity, 
the recent development of highperformance ntype Mg3Sb2based 
thermoelectric materials, which exhibit ZT  1.51 at 716 K,13,14 has 
encouraged further identification of ntype Zintl pnictides. However, fabricating ntype Zintl pnictides is not an easy task 
because most of the ntype doping is compensated by the socalled 
killer defects, such as cation vacancy.22 In addition to Mg3Sb2based 
materials, ABX4,23,24 Eu5xLaxIn2.2Sb6,25 Eu3InAs3,26 and Ba3Cd2P427 
have been reported as ntype Zintl pnictides so far. The crystal structure of Zintl arsenide Eu5In2As6 belongs to the 
orthorhombic space group Pbam, as shown in Figure 1.28,29 Each In 
atom is fourfold coordinated by As atoms to form InAs4 tetrahedra, 
which are cornershared along the c axis.

Description:
Forms chains of tetrahedra that are bridged by AsAs bonds.

Text:
The chains of InAs4 
tetrahedra are further bridged by AsAs bonds. The Eu atoms 
between the chains provide electrons to the covalently bonded 
anionic framework, yielding an overall charge balance. Mssbauer 
spectroscopy suggests the valence state as Eu25In32As34As22, 
while Zintlconcept describes that as Eu25In2As4As22. This 
material undergoes twostep magnetic transitions at 5 K and 16 K, 
likely because of Eu2 ions that include three distinct 
crystallographic sites.29 
In this study, we demonstrate that Zintl arsenide Eu5In2As6 is a 
bipolar dopable material. La and Zn were used as the ntype and p
type dopants, respectively, because these elements have been
