Description:
A vital element involved in cellular respiration and energy production, often limited in hypoxic conditions.

Text:
Hypoxia, defined as insufficient oxygen, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including, 
myocardial ischemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, and cancer.1 Hypoxia is a common 
feature of solid tumors and is associated with resistance to standard therapies, increased metastasis, and poor 
patient prognosis.2 Regions of chronic hypoxia occur beyond the diffusion limit of oxygen in metabolically active 
cancer cells, typically 100 m, while acute hypoxia can occur within a tumor resulting from changes in red blood 
cell flux and vascular remodeling.

Description:
A key element involved in physiological processes and tumor hypoxia.

Text:
Notably, cycling or intermittent changes in oxygen levels also occurs in tumors 
and can be exacerbated during therapy.3 Typically, physiological levels of oxygen (physoxia) are defined as 37 
O2, tumor hypoxia is defined as 2 O2, and extreme levels of hypoxia (0.1 O2) termed radiobiological 
hypoxia, are those most associated with resistance to radiotherapy.4,5 Importantly, the biological response differs 
in an oxygendependent manner, for example while the hypoxiainducible factors (HIFs) are induced at both 2 
and 0.1 O2, the DNA damage response or unfolded protein response is restricted to the lower oxygen tension.6 
There is an unmet need for imaging tools that not only detect hypoxia but also inform on the level of oxygen 
present, because median oxygen concentrations within a tumor can range from 4.20.1 O2.4 
One biological response to hypoxia is the production reductase enzymes (cytochrome P450 reductase and 
nitroreductase) that catalyze oxygensensitive bioreductive reactions.

Description:
A molecule that influences the enzymatic reduction of probes to reveal fluorophores.

Text:
We demonstrate that these probes are 
enzymatically reduced, in an oxygen dependent manner, to reveal a palette of fluorophores with emission maxima 
ranging through red, orange, and green. Varying the pKa of the dye and the substitution on the methylene unit of 
the indolequinone, results in compounds that are activated at different oxygen concentrations, ranging from 6, 
4, 2, and 1 , and at different rates. Validation of these probes in 2D and 3D cell culture demonstrates 
that they are powerful and convenient tools for sensing a range of different hypoxia levels.
