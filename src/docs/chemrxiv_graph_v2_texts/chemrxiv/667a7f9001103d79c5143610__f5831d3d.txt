Description:
A cation that can be hosted by the bilayered V2O5 phase.

Text:
The 
bilayered V2O5 phase (V2O5) is particularly versatile due to its ability to host a variety of 
cations, such as lithium, sodium, manganese, or zinc.5,6 It can further be synthesized by several 
wetchemical and hydrothermal methods, yielding a wide variety of attainable morphologies.7 
Thus, the material is suitable as a model system to explore electrochemical intercalation 
properties as a function of the host material structure and particularly its interlayer spacing. An emerging concept to reduce kinetic limitations in host materials is the direct tuning of 
lattice parameters, such as the interlayer spacing of layered and twodimensional materials, 
thereby modifying the nanoconfinement geometry within the host.
