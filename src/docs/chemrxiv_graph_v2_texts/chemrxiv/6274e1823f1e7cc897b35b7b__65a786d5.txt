Description:
A polycrystalline phosphorus-rich phosphide used in thin film applications.

However, reports of polycrys
talline Prich phosphides as thin films are very scarce
and seem to be limited to basic characterization of ZnP2
and CdP2 deposited by evaporation of powders of the
presynthesized compounds.3,4 Thinfilm growth from el

emental or gaseous sources would significantly simplify
the synthesis process. Similar to other Prich phosphides, bulk synthesis of
CuP2 as a singlecrystal or powder is well established510
but there are no reports of thinfilm growth.
