Description:
Nitrides and carbonitrides with unique physical and chemical properties.

Text:
Twodimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition metal chalcogenides (MoS2 
and others) 13, nitrides and carbonitrides (MXenes) 47, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) 8,9, 
double layered hydroxides 1012, and some others 13,14, attract great attention due to unique 
physical and chemical properties, which could be applied in electronics, catalysts, sensors, 
biomedicine and other fields. There exist also layered materials constructed by alternating quasi
atomic metal chalcogenide and hydroxide layers 1520, first of all, FeSe and (Li,Fe)OH 
exhibiting superconductivity with the critical temperatures as high as 40 K 2123, and 
unabundant natural minerals composed, in particular, of Fe sulfide (tochilinite) or FeCu sulfide 
and Mgbased hydroxide (brucite) sheets (tochilinite and valleriite, respectively), and a series of 
rarer analogs of different composition 24, 25.
