The relaxation dynamics of the ethylene cation C2H

has gained signicant attention
due to its ultrafast nature. In particular, the photodynamics of the cation is known to
proceed through conical intersections, but despite it being the simplest possible  radical
system, the relaxation mechanism has been discussed for more than a decade.612 In one of
the most recent studies, Zinchenko et al.8 identied the electronic relaxation from the rst
excited state of the ethylene cation (D1) to its ground state (D0) through a planar conical
intersection. The most direct evidence of the electronic relaxation was the observation of
a shortlived transient feature assigned to the D1 state in both the experiment (attosecond
