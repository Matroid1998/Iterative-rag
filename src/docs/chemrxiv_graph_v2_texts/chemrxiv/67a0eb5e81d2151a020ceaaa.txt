Description:
A simple surfactant molecule used as an emulsifier and stabilizer.

Text:
In a micelle,
the hydrophilic head sections of the molecules form a shell in contact with water whereas the
hydrophobic tails are sequestered in the aggregate score. Micelles are widely utilized in many areas
due to their versatility and availability in commercial quantities 25. Simple surfactant molecules
(i.e., salts of dodecyl amine, dodecyl sulfate, hexadecyltrimethylammonium, etc.) have small core
diameters in the order of a few nanometers 6,7 and find extensive use in cosmetics, food and
coating industries as emulsifiers and stabilizers. Micelles can also be formed from copolymeric molecules, polymers which contain more than one
type of building block, by modification or grafting of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections
