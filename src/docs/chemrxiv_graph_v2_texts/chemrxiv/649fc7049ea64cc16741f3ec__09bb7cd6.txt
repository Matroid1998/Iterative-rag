Description:
Used in dilute solutions for wet etching to tune the thickness of oriented mesoporous silica films.

16, 17 Wet etching
based on dilute ammonium fluoride solutions has also been used to tune the thickness of oriented
mesoporous silica films. 18 However, dry etching methods require expensive instruments and
highselectivity masking materials. Masking materials such as chromium (Cr) 19, photoresists,
polysilicon, amorphous silicon, aluminum, silicon nitride, and chromiumgold (CrAu) 20 have
been reported for the etching of silica. These are typically patterned on the substrate using standard
lithography techniques. Metalpolymeric nanoparticles (NPs) could replace these masking materials
for the etching process. A combination of solidstate dewetting and annealing of thin metallic films
on the silica surfaces resulted in the deposition of different metal NPs which acts as an etchant
mask.
