Description:
Amino groups that primarily react with glutaraldehyde during CLEC formation.

Text:
CLECs of various enzymes have previously been reported to display high 
stability regarding temperature and pH, also in extreme conditions, and have been applied for 
biocatalytic reactions in nonconventional reaction media.2022 The most common crosslinker used 
for CLEC formation is glutaraldehyde, which reacts primarily with amino groups of lysines, but is also 
able to crosslink arginine and tyrosine side chains.23 Previous attempts, however, to crosslink HheG 
crystals with glutaraldehyde via soaking resulted only in inactive CLECs. The high excess of 
glutaraldehyde during crosslinking likely also resulted in crosslinking of Tyr165 and Arg169 of the
