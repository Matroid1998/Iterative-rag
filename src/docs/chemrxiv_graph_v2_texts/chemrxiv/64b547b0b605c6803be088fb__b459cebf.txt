Description:
A material used in devices with higher sensitivity compared to MoS2.

Text:
Due to their excellent surfacetovolume ratio,
the impact of the effect on the charge carrier concentration of the sheets
is significantly greater than on the bulk materials, which allows for high
sensitivity even at room temperature. Despite the aforementioned similarities, the growing body of work
begins to suggest relevant differences in sensor performance that de
pend on the type of TMD used (see Table 1). Current data shows
that MoS2based devices tend to have a lower sensitivity compared to
MoSe2 and MoTe2, but at the same time have a faster recovery 16
19. This could be affected by several factors, such as sheet quality,
contact types, and exposure conditions. However, it seems unlikely
that the sheet type itself had no impact given the substantial difference
in sensitivity.
