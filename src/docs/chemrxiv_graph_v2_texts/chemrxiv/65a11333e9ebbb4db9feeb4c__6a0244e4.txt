Description:
An older trivial name for thiocyanate.

Text:
In most of the described binary frame
works thiocyanate is both N and Sbound and for these M(NCS)x is used without
implying anything about the local bonding. Other older trivial names for thiocyanate include rhodanide and sulfocyanide. of thiocyanate in solution or with coligands has been excluded
as it is wellcovered elsewhere.3,12,13 The review summarizes the
chemistry of the binary M(NCS)x for every nonradioactive metal,
and the structure of every ternary metal thiocyanate MM(NCS)x. Special attention has been paid to the structural analogies be
tween metal thiocyanates and other inorganic solidstate com
pounds. I have relied, in addition to the primary literature,
on two book chapters Golub, Khler and Skopenko (1986)14
and Williams (1948),15 which are the most comprehensive sum
maries of metal thiocyanate chemistry thus far published.
