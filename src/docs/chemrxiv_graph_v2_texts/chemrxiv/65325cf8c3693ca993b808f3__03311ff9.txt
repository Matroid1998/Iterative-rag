Description:
A substance that can accept an electron pair from a donor molecule.

Text:
Different from the direct charge transfer (CT) between molec
ular dopants and OSC material, which in the simplest picture is
driven by the energetic difference between HOMO and LUMO lev
els of the two entities, the mechanisms behind the more recently
developed doping methods are more complex. In Lewis acid dop
ing, it is proposed that an OSC polymer is first protonated by the
Lewis acid and then attains an electron from a second polymer
