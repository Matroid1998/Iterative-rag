Description:
A prevalent ring system in pharmaceuticals, often substituted in aromatic ring-containing small-molecule drugs.

Aromatic motifs are vital components of many approved drugs as well as drugs under clinical 
24 
trial.1,2,3,4,5 Substituted benzene ring, which constitutes 63 of aromatic ringcontaining smallmolecule 
25 
drugs, is the most prevalent ring system in pharmaceuticals (Fig. 1A).1,5 However, under physiological 
26 
conditions, organic compounds with more than two substituted benzene rings often have poor solubility, 
27 
low target specificity, and low metabolic stability thus halting the entry of pharmaceutical candidates to 
28 
the final phases of drug development.6,7 Substituting benzene rings with heteroaromatic units (e.g.,
