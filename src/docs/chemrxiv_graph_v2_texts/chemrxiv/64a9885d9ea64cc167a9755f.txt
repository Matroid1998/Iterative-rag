Description:
A key component in lithium-ion batteries, known for high energy density and operating voltage.

Text:
Electrochemical energy storage in batteries is crucial for successfully transitioning from fossil
fuel usage to a sustainable energy economy .1 Lithiumion batteries (LIBs) exhibit a high
energy density and operating voltage while maintaining a suciently long cycle life. Thus,
LIBs have established themselves as the prime nonstationary energy storage solution .2
However, LIBs cannot store the inexorably increasing energy needed for todays society
for various reasons. Not the least of these reasons is the relative scarcity of lithium in
the earths crust and its uneven global distribution, combined with the environmentally
unfriendly mining process.3 It is, therefore, essential to diversify energy storage beyond
lithium.

Description:
Used in batteries and known for its chemically similar behavior to sodium.

Text:
One of the most promising alternatives to lithium batteries are sodium batteries 4
which, unlike lithium, do not suer from scarcity issues due to sodiums relative abundance. Based on sodiums chemically similar behavior to lithium, many concepts developed through
the study of lithium batteries can be applied to sodium batteries .5,6
One such aspect lies in understanding the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Although there are dierences due to dierent kinds of anode materials used between lithium
