Description:
Complex released from Pt(IV) prodrug, leading to pronounced toxicity and complicating clinical use.

Text:
Pt(IV) complexes are considered as the nextgeneration 
platinum antitumor drugs, capable of overcoming drug 
resistance.911 Kinetic stability of the octahedral Pt(IV) 
complexes results in enhanced intracellular penetration, while 
high variability of axial ligands opens path to multiaction 
antitumor agents with enhanced biological activity.12,13 On the 
other hand, Pt (IV) complexes are also possessing low selectivity 
and prone to rapid reduction in the bloodstream; as a result 
their therapeutic effectiveness is almost indistinguishable from 
that of the parent Pt(II) complex.14,15 Thus, uncontrolled and 
premature release of the cytotoxic Pt(II) complex from Pt(IV) 
prodrug leads to pronounced toxicity of Pt(IV) prodrugs and 
complicates their clinical use. A lightinduced activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs is an elegant 
approach that allows spatial and temporal control over the 
release of Pt(II) drug.
