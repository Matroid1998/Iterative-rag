Description:
A compound used in supplements, analyzed for its iron content using cyclic voltammetry.

Text:
of cyclic voltammetry to upperlevel undergraduate chemistry 
students. This work presents a simple bufferfree cyclic voltammetry experiment for the quantification of elemental 
iron in ferrous sulfate supplements using standard addition to a single solution. The various student learning 
outcomes highlighted in this work include the introduction to the basic principles of cyclic voltammetry, the 
construction of a calibration curve based on the RandlesSevcik equation, obtaining a linear regression equation 
using Microsoft excel, acid digestion of drug supplements, and quality assurance through a statistical evaluation of 
experimental data. This laboratory experiment also emphasizes the advantages of using the method of a standard 
addition to a single solution.

Description:
A supplement prescribed to prevent or treat iron deficiency anemia, administered orally as a liquid, tablet, or capsule.

Text:
13 About onefifth of iron in the body is 
stored in an intracellular protein called ferritin, with seventy percent stored in hemoglobin.3,4 Chronically low iron 
levels either through blood loss, pregnancy, or inadequate iron intake can cause iron depletion over time, resulting 
in iron deficiency anemia.5,6 Iron intake through food fortification or medicinal supplementation has been shown to 
be effective in preventing and treating iron deficiency anemia.57 Excess iron intake, on the other hand, has been 
linked to the etiology of a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.8 Ferrous 
sulfate supplements are often prescribed to prevent or treat iron deficiency anemia.912 It is administered orally as a 
liquid, tablet, or capsule.13 In the context of possible low iron intake or overload, the validation of the actual amount 
of iron contained in ferrous sulfate supplements is imperative.
