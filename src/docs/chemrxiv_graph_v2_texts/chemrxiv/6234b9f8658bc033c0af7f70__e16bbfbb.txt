Description:
Frequently used in experimental studies as a late transition metal catalyst.

Text:
While late transition metals like 
palladium have been frequently used in experimental studies in the 
past6067, recent studies are shifting towards the use of catalysts 
containing manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel68, etc. as they show 
comparable or even better reactivity than the late transition metal 
catalysts60, 6971. Of the midrow 3d metal catalysts, manganese 
catalysts for CH fluorination look particularly attractive due to 
the nontoxicity of manganese, its relatively low cost, and 
environment friendly characteristics60, 
67, 
7274. Manganese 
enzymes75 found in nature can activate CH bonds with high 
dissociation energy, which led to development of bioinspired 
molecular catalysts60. Several experimental studies and few computational studies 
considered Mnporphyrin catalysts and Mnsalen catalysts to carry 
out CH halogenation, in particular, CH fluorination12, 7677.
