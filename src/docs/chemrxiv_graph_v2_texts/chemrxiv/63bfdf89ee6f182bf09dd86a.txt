Description:
An effective stabilizer for soil matrix particles.

Text:
Nevertheless, it is known that polymers containing hydrocarbon chains act as a binder of soil 
matrix particles, reducing dust, and stabilizing the system as well. GO et al demonstrated that 
lignosulfonates can be an effective stabilizer (5). Sinha et al have suggested that lignites may be 
more effective in stabilizing granulated soils (6) . Vedenskaya et al. (7) used copolymers to consolidate sands, silts, and clays. The copolymers 
used were guanidine acrylate (GA), methylene bisacrylamide (MBAM), and ethylene 
dimethacrylamid (EDMA). The additive formula consisted of a 241 ratio of vinyl monomer to 
diene. The combination of GA and EDMA performed best in sands and loams followed by GA
