Description:
A compound involved in greenhouse gas emissions and synthesized using the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process.

Text:
Ammonia production accounts for 12 of global greenhouse gas emissions due to its use
of the energy intensive HaberBosch process, which has been targeted for electrification.110
Searching for a strategy to facilitate efficient green synthesis of ammonia, lithiummediated
electrochemical ammonia synthesis (LiMEAS) has recently demonstrated promise by consis
tently achieving current efficiencies above 60 with high ammonia production yields.1114
This LiMEAS approach can be described as a threestep process involving (i) electrodeposi
tion of lithium onto an electrode (Eq. 1), (ii) formation of a lithium nitride film via nitrogen
dissociation (Eq. 2), and (iii) hydrogenation of the nitrogen by a proton donor to release
