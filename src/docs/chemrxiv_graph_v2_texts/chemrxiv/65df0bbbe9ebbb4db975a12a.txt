compounds in the chemical and finechemical industries, as it achieves molecular separation 
while avoiding the phase changes associated with thermal separation techniques such as 
fractional distillation or crystallisation.6,7 Promising applications for the separation of specific 
organic compounds by RO membranes include the fractionation of light crude oil,8 or the 
separation of xylene isomers.9
