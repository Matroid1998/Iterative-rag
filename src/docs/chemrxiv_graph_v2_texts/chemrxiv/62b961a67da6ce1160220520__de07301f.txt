Description:
A class of 2D nanomaterials successful in biomedicine.

Text:
After the discovery of graphene, twodimensional (2D) 
nanomaterials have become an emerging class in science13. They provide numerous opportunities for electronics, catalysis, 
optics and (gas) storage on the nanoscale and beyond19. Furthermore, their use in biomedical applications is a main 
focus for researchers1015. Classes of 2D nanomaterials which 
have proven successful in biomedicine include graphene, 
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered double 
hydroxides (LDHs), silicate clays, transition metal oxides 
(TMOs), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and many more1618. Hydrophobicity and the chemical inertness of most 2D 
nanomaterials are challenges especially for biological 
applications, in aqueous environments. Especially inorganic 
materials e.g. metal sulfides, chalcogenides and silicates require 
additional surface chemistry for example to guarantee colloidal 
stability.
