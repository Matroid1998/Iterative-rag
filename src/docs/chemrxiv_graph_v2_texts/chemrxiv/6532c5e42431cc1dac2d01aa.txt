Description:
A component of the four-letter genetic alphabet in DNA.

Text:
In every DNAbased organism, genetic information is 
represented by a fourletter genetic alphabet composed of 
deoxyadenosine (dA), deoxyguanosine (dG), deoxycytidine 
(dC), and deoxythymidine (dT)1. The storage and retrieval 
of this information depend on the formation of two base 
pairs, (d)AdTU and (d)G(d)C. Synthetic biology2, which 
emerged over a century ago, aims to create new biological 
forms with potential applicability towards biomedical and 
bio engineering fields3. One promising approach to 
achieving this goal is to expand the amount of information 
that can be stored and retrieved in a cell4, 5.
