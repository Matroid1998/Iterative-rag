Cucurbit8uril and drugs of abuse Gibbs energies of binding 
Curcurubituril8 is a host with only a few conformers accessible 
thus enabling a fast sampling of host conformations.15 However, 
with certain force fields, cucurbituril hosts have been observed 
to collapse during simulations. CB8 and guest molecules form 
11 complexes with experimental Gibbs energies of binding in a 
range between 7.05 (for G1) and 14.07 kcalmol (for G6).14 
High affinity measurements have attributed this to an 
interaction between the guests ammonium group interacting 
and the carbonyl oxygen of CB8. Figure 1. CB8 host and guest structures G1  G9. Figure 2 shows the deviation of calculated Gibbs energies of 
binding of CB8 to ligands G1G9 from experiment.
