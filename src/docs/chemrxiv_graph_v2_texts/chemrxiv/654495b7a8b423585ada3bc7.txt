Description:
A metal cation that stabilizes G-quadruplexes.

Due to the versatility and abundancy (estimated at 50 billion metric tons)5, genetic biopolymer 
DNA can condensate to form novel biohybrid materials such as DNA gels6a,b, DNA 
dendrimers6c, 
DNA 
nanoparticles6d, 
threedimensional 
crystals6e, 
DNA 
origami6f, 
constitutional dynamic networks6g etc. Several DNAbased material developments7a are 
oriented around the formation of Gquadraplexes, which is comprised of four guanine units 
interconnected through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding and stabilized by a metal cation such as 
K, Na or NH4 ions7b,c. Gquadraplexes play an important role in several cellular pathways 
that include DNA replication, gene expression and telomere maintenance8. Most of the biological phase separations of DNA involve polyelectrolytes with nonuniform 
charge distribution and multivalent reciprocity associated via electrostatic interactions9.
