Description:
Often present in pharmacologically active drugs, particularly in heterocycle rings.

Text:
While prior studies demonstrate successful fluorination of some 
substrates, typically without heteroatoms7681, pharmacologically
active drugs often involve the presence of fluorine in heterocycle 
rings, steroids (and their derivatives), etc., including N andor O 
heteroatoms103. In this study, we first aim to understand the ground 
spin state of the Mnporphyrin intermediates as predicted by 
hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and its sensitivity to the 
functional. We then compute reaction energies along the catalytic 
cycle for substrates used in prior experimental studies76 to estimate 
a possible role of thermodynamic factors in the control of 
reactivity 
and 
regioselectivity 
of 
Mnporphyrincatalyzed 
fluorination.
