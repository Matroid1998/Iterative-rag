Description:
Involved in the binding and hydrolysis process within ABC transporters.

They are considered as highly attractive 
antimicrobial targets, since they are required for the uptake of essential micronutrients, making 
them indispensable for both growth and survival of bacteria.3 These micronutrients are involved 
in cell metabolism and include watersoluble Btype vitamins such as folate4, panthothenate5, 
riboflavin6 and metal ions7,8. In general, ECF transporters belong to the family of the adenosine 
5triphosphate (ATP)binding cassette (ABC) transporters, consisting of four domains.9 Three of 
them form a complex that is called ECF module, containing two nucleotidebinding domains 
(NBDs)ECFA and ECFAwhich hydrolyze ATP10, as well as one transmembrane domain 
ECFT (or Tcomponent).
