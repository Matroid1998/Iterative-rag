Description:
Involved in high-valent redox reactions for achieving high energy density in TMOs.

Text:
Layered transition metal oxides (TMOs),
NaxTMO2 where TM is a transition metal, have emerged as the most energy dense class of NIB
cathode materials compared to Prussian bluewhite analogs and polyanions.7 The path to
achieving the highest energy density in TMOs should involve highvalent redox reactions (i.e.,
the over oxidation of TMs or oxygen).

Description:
Involved in a high-valent redox reaction stabilized by an electron hole polaron.

Text:
used advanced Xray
characterization and computational techniques to develop a deeper mechanistic understanding of
this reaction, proving that the highvalent redox reaction was O2O redox stabilized by an
electron hole polaron on the oxygen as opposed to structural rearrangement mediated by the
formation of an OO dimer.9 The formation of O in NMO was further confirmed using electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR).16 Moreover, it is the O2 ions bordering the ordered vacancy that
undergo this redox reaction because their nonbonding 2p orbitals are at the Fermi level and are
thus first to oxidize.9,1214 The ordered vacancy is central (a design principle) to the reversible and
lowhysteresis highvalent redox behavior in NMO.
