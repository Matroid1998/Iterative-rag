Description:
Can act as a sink for OH in marine air and contribute substantially to aerosol and new particle formation.

The microbiota of the worlds oceans produce a plethora of organic gases leading to ocean emissions (14). Such 
35 
emissions are particularly important for atmospheric chemistry in the polar regions which are relatively pristine and far 
36 
away from terrestrial sources (5, 6). Among organic gases, nonmethane hydrocarbons can act as a sink for OH in 
37 
marine air (7, 8) and can contribute substantially to aerosol (911) as well as new particle formation (5). Accurately 
38 
quantifying natural marine aerosol particularly in the polar regions is crucial to estimate aerosol climate forcing (9, 12, 
39 
13), especially since secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have been suggested to exert a strong effect on cloud formation 
40 
(14).
