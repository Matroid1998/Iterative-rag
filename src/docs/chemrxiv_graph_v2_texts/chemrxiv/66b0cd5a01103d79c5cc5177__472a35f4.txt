The implementation of SF in photovoltaics is however
hampered by the lack of suitable materials fulfilling the
requirements for SF (a) an energy of the lowest singlet
state ES1 at least twice the one of the lowest triplet state
ET1 (ES12T1  ES1 2ET1 0); 4 (b) a delocal
ized or chargetransfer singlet exciton to promote direct
or chargetransfer mediated singlet fission mechanisms, re
spectively; 6 (c) triplets of sufficiently high energy for in
jection into the conduction band of a semiconductor cell
(ET1 Egap); 7 (d) synthesizability; and (e), photo and
chemical stability. 8 Experimentally investigated SF can
didate materials can be broadly classified as acene deriva
tives, rylenediimides, diketopyrrolopyrroles and conjugated
polymers.
