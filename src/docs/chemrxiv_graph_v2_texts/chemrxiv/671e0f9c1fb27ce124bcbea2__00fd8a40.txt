Description:
Used in clamp complexes for catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles, ketones, and aldehydes.

Text:
Homogeneous 
catalytic systems including Co, Fe20, and 
Mncomplexes show good selectivity under 
mild conditions and are of great interest to 
researchers7. Bornscheins team20 was the 
first to use the iron PNP clamp complex to 
achieve good functional group tolerance. Esters, 
ethers, 
acetamidobenzenes, 
and 
amino 
substituents were not reduced in the presence 
of nitriles. The complex developed by the team 
constituted the first example of homogeneous 
catalysis, successfully achieving the selective 
hydrogenation 
of 
industrially 
important 
dinitriles to 1,6hexanediamine. Mukherjees 
team21 first reported a reaction case catalyzed 
by Co PNNH clamp complexes to produce 
primary 
amines 
selectively. Elangovans 
team22 first described the use of manganese 
clamp 
complexes 
in 
the 
catalytic 
hydrogenation 
of 
nitriles, 
ketones, 
and 
aldehydes.
