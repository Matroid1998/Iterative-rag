Description:
A single cylindrical tube structure in singlewall carbon nanotubes.

Text:
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a onedimensional (1D) allotrope of carbon, made up of a sp2 
hybridized carbon lattice in the form of a cylinder. A singlewall CNT (SWCNT), the simplest 
version of a CNT, consists of a single, cylindrical graphene tube. In doublewall CNTs (DWCNTs) 
and multiwall CNTs (MWCNTs), two or more tubes are either nested concentrically or wrapped 
like a scroll.

Description:
2D allotropes of carbon.

Text:
SWCNTs are typically 0.42 nm in diameter, while MWCNTs can be much larger, with 
diameters of tens of nanometers, having both ends generally capped by fullerenelike domes.1 
Similar to fullerenes and graphene, which are the analogous 0 and 2D allotropes of carbon, the 
graphitelike arrangement of carbon atoms in CNTs and their shape give them remarkable and 
unique properties, which has resulted in the widespread use of CNTs in several fields of science 
and technology, including energy storage, electronics, structural composites, biomaterials, and 
others.
