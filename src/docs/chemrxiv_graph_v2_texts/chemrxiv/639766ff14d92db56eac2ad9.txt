Residues whose redox state modulates p53 DNA binding activity and specificity.

710 Approximately 50 of human tumours carries 
a mutation in TP53, from which 90 are missense mutations in 
the DBDencoding sequence.11 A consequence of mutations is 
the impairment of the structure or the p53DNA binding activity 
andor specificity.4 The p53 function is strictly regulated in the cell 
by a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms, such as post
translational modifications or longrange interactions between 
p53 domains.1214 In addition to these regulatory controls, p53 
must be exquisitely sensitive and selective to various cellular 
environments.1416 One particular aspect that has gained 
attention is how the redox state of the cysteine residues 
modulates the p53DNA binding activity and specificity.1722 
Several research groups reported that DNAmediated charge 
transport by ultraviolet radiation promotes oxidative dissociation 
of p53 from DNA repairassociated Gadd45 RE in an electron
based mechanism involving a cysteine (Cys) oxidation (Cys277) 
and disulfide formation.1718 Interestingly, p53 remained bound to 
the cell cycle regulating p21 RE under similar experimental 
conditions revealing a geneselective transcription to provide a 
concise biological response.

Description:
Contains reactive residues that are profiled in the study of H2O2-induced molecular mechanisms.

Uberti et al., concluded that following 
H2O2 insult, oligodendroglialike cells express p21 protein in a 
p53independent manner.20 Controversially, a recent report 
shows the accumulation of p21 protein level upon H2O2 exposure 
in RPETert cells.22 Using CRISPRCASP9derived RPETert p53 KO 
cells, p21 was not expressed, suggesting an induced p53
dependent mechanism. Herein, we performed native MS and ion 
mobility (IM)MS studies on p53 in the absence and presence of 
p21 RE and profiled reactive cysteine residues to finally examined 
the H2O2induced molecular mechanism on the tetrameric DNA
p53 complex. Results and Discussion
