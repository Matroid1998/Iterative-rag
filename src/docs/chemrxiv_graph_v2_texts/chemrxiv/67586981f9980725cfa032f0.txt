Description:
A nanostructured material used to enhance the analytical signal of electrochemical MIP sensors.

The easiest way to enhance 
the analytical signal of an electrochemical MIP sensor is embedding nanostructured materials, such as 
multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) 1518, graphene 1922, quantum dots (QDs) 16, or gold 
NPs 22, 23 in the MIP films. Despite the convenience, this approach offers only limited electrode surface 
development and signal enhancement. Electrodes of high specific surface area were applied to achieve a 
higher electrochemical signal. For example, deposition of various porous noble metal films on the surface 
of flat electrodes was reported 2428. These methodologies resulted in the deposition of noble metals of 
significantly enhanced surface area. However, these procedures were laborious and expensive.
