Description:
A subset of dioxins that are harmful organic pollutants.

Text:
The widespread environmental issue of organic pollutants toxicity has garnered signicant atten
tion and concern within both the scientic community and the general public. Dioxins, such as
polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), represent a
subset of these harmful organic pollutants. They originate from various sources like waste inciner
ation, cigarette smoke, car exhaust, and natural combustion processes 1, 2, 3. These substances,
known for their chemical stability, readily accumulate in fatty tissues and persist for approximately
11 years, posing a threat to both humans and animals. In particular, 2,3,7,8tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin (TCDD), illustrated in Fig. 1, is identied as
one of the most perilous dioxins. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
classied TCDD as a human carcinogen 4.
