Description:
Undergo metal-catalyzed chemoselective reduction via hydroboration.

Text:
However, those 
chemical transformations usually require harsh reaction envi
ronments with vast amounts of metal waste, resulting in poor 
yields and insufficient selectivity.3a, 7, 8 
Over the past few years, metalcatalyzed chemoselective re
duction of carbonyls via hydroboration9 has been widely stud
ied. Moreover, metalcatalyzed hydroboration of other chal
lenging unsaturated organic substrates,9ad, 9f, 9k, 10 including 
heteroallenes such as CO211 and carbodiimide,12 have been 
developed. Despite that, aluminum12eg catalyzed hydrobora
tion of CDIs is limited and suffers from disadvantages such as 
limited substrate scope and higher catalyst loading.
