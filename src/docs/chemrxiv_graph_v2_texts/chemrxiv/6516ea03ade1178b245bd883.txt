photostabilityphotoreactivity of nucleobases and their derivatives is essential for 
understanding the molecular origins of life.1,2 As such, extensive research has been 
conducted over the years to explore the electronic relaxation pathways that are 
responsible for the inherent photostability of the pyrimidine and purine derivatives.211 It 
has been shown that the photostability of these derivatives cannot be solely attributed to
