of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in fluorescence 
response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anionbinding induced 
emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is both 
dependent on the nature of the XBHB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in 
terms of both anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn
OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redoxinactive controls display a large turnON response, highlighting the 
pronounced impact of introduction of the redoxactive ferrocene on optical sensing performance. Additionally, the 
redoxactive ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in 
competitive solvents.
