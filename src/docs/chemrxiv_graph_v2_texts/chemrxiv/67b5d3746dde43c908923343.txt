Description:
Undergo hydrosilylation catalyzed by Mg complexes, involving dinuclear and monomeric species.

Text:
The 
nuclearity of Mg complexes, influenced by factors such as steric strain,18,19 the presence of 
coordinating solvents or coligands,14,18,2022 and coligand size,15 significantly impacts their 
reactivity. For example, computational studies by Garcia et al. on Mgcatalysed 
hydrosilylation of alkenes have shown that dinuclear complexes can retain their nuclearity 
during alkene insertion, whilst subsequent steps involve monomeric species.23 The 
cooperative reactivity of these dinuclear complexes has been highlighted in work by 
Spielmann et al., where dimagnesium complexes based on dinucleating (bisNacNac) ligands 
were shown to result in an alternative mechanistic pathway and decreased onset
