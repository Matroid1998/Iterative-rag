Description:
Accommodated more efficiently in GYs compared to traditional carbon-based materials like graphite.

Text:
For instance, in the GY series, GY1 represents a 
structure with one acetylenic linkage, while GY2 represents a structure with two acetylenic 
linkages, and so forth. Although first theoretically predicted by Baughman and coworkers, 
several of these forms have since been successfully synthesized.911 Notably, GYs were the 
first form to be synthesized and are, therefore, the most characterized and explored.1215 The 
unique combination of sp and sp hybridized carbon atoms in GYs provides a distinctive 
framework that allows for more efficient accommodation of lithium ions compared to the 
traditional carbonbased materials like graphite.
