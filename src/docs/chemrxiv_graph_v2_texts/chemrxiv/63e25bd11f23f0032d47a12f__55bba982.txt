Description:
Two-dimensional anionic layers formed by edge and corner-sharing MX6 octahedra in postperovskite structures.

A unifying goal in solidstate science is control over the physi
cal properties of materials, and the tunability of perovskites is
perhaps the most striking example. Traditionally these com
pounds are threedimensional frameworks with a general chem
ical formula AMX3 built from MX6 cornersharing octahedra. Through substitution of the A, M and X ions, materials with re
markable magnetic,1 electronic conductivity,2 photovoltaic3 and
nonlinear optical properties,4 have been created. The perovskite structure is, however, only one of a widerange
of AMX3 structuretypes, with perhaps the most closely related
being the postperovskite structure. In contrast to perovskites,
postperovskites contain MX6 octahedra that both edge and
cornershare, resulting in twodimensional anionic MX3 lay
ers, rather than a three dimensional framework.
