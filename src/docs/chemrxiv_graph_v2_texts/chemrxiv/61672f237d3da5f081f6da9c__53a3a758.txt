Description:
A member of the bislactone limonoid alkaloids with a 5-membered lactone ring fused to a 6-membered ring adjacent to the pyridine.

Text:
The limonoid natural products are a diverse family of terpe
noids characterized by their structurally conserved C17furan 
and various modes of skeletal rearrangements.1,2 A fascinating 
subfamily of these natural products, the limonoid alkaloids, 
are recently isolated from the Chinese mangrove, Xylocarpus 
granatum.3,4 The structural hallmark of the limonoid alkaloids 
is the tetrasubstituted pyridine embedded in the core structure 
(Scheme 1), as typified by xylogranatopyridine B (11) and 
granatumine A (12). Furthermore, granatumine A (12) is a 
member of the bislactone limonoid alkaloids, in which the A
ring has undergone further modification to form a 5mem
bered lactone ring fused to the 6membered ring adjacent to 
the pyridine.

Description:
Has a C3-methoxy group assigned as the epimer.

Text:
For the limited number of bislactone limonoid 
alkaloids that have been isolated, diversity mainly arises from 
the oxygencontaining substituents present on the C3 position 
(12 to 14), as depicted in Scheme 1.3,4 While the C3methoxy 
group was assigned as the epimer for granatumine A (12), 
several other alkaloids in this class were proposed to have an 
C3substituent, such as the case of xylogranatin F (13). Sur
prisingly, granatoine (14) was proposed to have the same 
scaffold as xylogranatin F (13), except being diastereomeric 
at the C3, C5, and C10 positions.4a 
Traditional methods for pyridine synthesis, including 
Hantzsch5 and Chichibabin6 pyridine synthesis, involve amine 
condensation onto carbonyl compounds, which entails intrin
sic restrictions on the substitution patterns of the target pyri
dines.
