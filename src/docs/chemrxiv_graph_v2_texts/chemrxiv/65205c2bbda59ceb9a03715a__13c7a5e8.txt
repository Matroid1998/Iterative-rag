Furthermore, accurate monitoring of serotonin in continuous time scale 
33

with high temporal resolution can help advance our understanding of the role of serotonin in many 
34

neurological disorders. 35

Various analytical methods including fluorimetry 15, radio immunoassay 16, enzyme immunoassay 
37

17, chemiluminescence 18 and mass spectrometry 19 have been used for the detection of 5HT. 38

Although many of these techniques achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detection, they are not 
39

ideal for in situ continuous and realtime measurement of an analyte from neurons or tissue samples 
40

due to many factors including bulkiness of the instrument, long measurement time, and a requirement 
41

for sampling and offline analysis to name a few.
