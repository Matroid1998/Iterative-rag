Popper perovskites (RPPs) are a related material class that has shown some promise to be more 
resilient to environmental stress then conventional ABX3 perovskites. In this work, we study 
RPPs with the general formula R2(MA)n1BnX3n1, where the R stands for a large cation(s) 
which typically does not satisfy the GTF rule, methylammonium cation (MA), B2 metal 
cation, and halide anion (X). The quasi2D structure of RPPs is shown schematically in Figure 
1. Due to their large size, the R cation cannot be incorporated into the 3D perovskite lattice.
