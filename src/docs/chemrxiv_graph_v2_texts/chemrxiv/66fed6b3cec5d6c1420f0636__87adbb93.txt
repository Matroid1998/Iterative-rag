Description:
Has polar crystal structures that are stable at low crystal sizes and a high band gap energy of 6 eV, making it transparent to visible, UVA, UVB, and part of UVC radiation.

Interestingly, since the adventitious discovery of 
ferroelectricity in HfO2, it was found that its polar crystal structures are particularly 
stable at low crystal sizes and that, on the contrary to PZT, larger crystal sizes are 
detrimental. HfO2 has also a high band gap energy ( 6 eV),18 which makes it 
transparent to visible, UVA, UVB and part of UVC radiation. In the field of hafnia ferroelectrics, ITO has been used as seed layer to control the 
phase, orientation, and crystallite size of HfO2. This is because, just like HfO2, ITO 
crystallizes into a fluoritebased structure.19 A great deal of experimental and 
theoretical work on ferroelectric HfO2 deposited on ITObuffered substrates has
