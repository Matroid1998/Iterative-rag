Description:
Undergoes phase transformations influenced by the type of pressure applied.

Text:
Investigations 
of pure substances have shown that the thermodynamic stability of polymorphs can change as a 
function of pressure8 but, in addition, the type of pressure (isotropic vs anisotropic) is important and 
can promote or inhibit transformation e.g. ammonium nitrate.9,10 These changes have been observed 
not only for pure components but also within formulated tablets composed of drugexcipient mixtures 
to create robust compacts that mimic oral solid dosage forms for delivery to patients. In the context of tableting, phase transformations are induced through the exertion of an axial pressure 
on the powder which causes both normal and shear stresses.
