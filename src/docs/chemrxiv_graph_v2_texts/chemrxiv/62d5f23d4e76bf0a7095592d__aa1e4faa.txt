Description:
A biodegradable and safe polymer largely used for the manufacture of delivery systems.

Text:
In recent decades, polymer based delivery platforms have attracted increasing attention due to the 
ability to release therapeutics at a controlled rate.1 The release profile can be customized in terms of 
quantity of drug released and release time depending on the therapeutic application. However, 
experimental optimization of drug release kinetics requires intensive, timeconsuming and costly 
optimization steps. Molecular Dynamics simulations can be used as a predictive tool to reduce the 
experimental workload. Coarsegrained models and enhanced sampling approaches can be combined 
to describe or phenomenologically explain drug release kinetics that occur at large spatial and 
temporal scales not easily accessible by atomistic simulations and unbiased approaches. Among 
polymer candidates, the FDA approved Polylacticglycolicacid (PLGA) is a biodegradable and safe 
polymer largely used for the manufacture of delivery systems.
