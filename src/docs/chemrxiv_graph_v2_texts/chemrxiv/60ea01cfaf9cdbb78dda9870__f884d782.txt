Description:
Lighter halides stabilize 2D structures but result in large band gaps.

Text:
However, the 2D layered structure only forms for a few 
compositions, most commonly bromides and chlorides such as Cs3Bi2Br9, Cs3Sb2Br9 and 
Cs3Fe2Cl9. The band gaps of these compounds are relatively wide due to the high 
electronegativity of the halide anions that typically adopt the layered arrangement. Therefore, 
while the 2D structure has inherent benefits, its stabilisation only by lighter halides means the 
band gaps of 2D compounds are typically large. Therefore, whilst developing methods to 
control the band gap and enhance optical absorption in leadfree halide materials is of general 
concern, it is especially important for 2D A3B2X9 compounds.
