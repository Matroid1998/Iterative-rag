Description:
Forms welldefined nanoparticles with controlled particle size through chemical reduction.

For example, sodium borohydride 
(NaBH4) has been widely employed as a reducing agent for the colloidal synthesis of transition 
metals.2129 Moreover, chemical reduction has proven to yield welldefined Pt nanoparticles with 
distinct control over particle size in combination with a narrow particle size distribution.2124 This 
is due to the adjustable amount of the liquid reducing agent and thus the strength and speed of the 
reduction compared to alternative methods e.g., with gaseous H2. In addition, the utilization of 
steric capping agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), is essential to circumvent 
agglomeration of the synthesized nanoparticles.3031 For catalytic applications, the separately 
synthesized, chemically reduced nanoparticles can be immobilized onto a support.
