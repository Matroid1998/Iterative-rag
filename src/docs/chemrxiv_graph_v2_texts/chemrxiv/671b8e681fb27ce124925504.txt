Description:
Forms nanocomposites to improve kinetics in ion intercalation reactions for energy storage.

Text:
Ion intercalation reactions within layered or twodimensional host materials have attracted 
considerable attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage. They involve the 
insertion of ions into the interlayer spaces of host materials causing small structural changes. This yields relatively high chemical and electrochemical reversibility and cycling stability,1 
making layered materials promising candidates for applications in highpower energy storage 
devices. Currently, improving the kinetics of ion intercalation reactions is at the core of such 
research efforts. This includes a wide variety of approaches, including reducing crystallite 
sizes,2,3 carbon nanocomposite formation,4,5 expanding interlayer distances,6,7 electrode 
architecture design with hierarchical porosity,8,9 or facilitating ionsolvent cointercalation 
reactions.1012 While any of these strategies can enhance the overall kinetics, they typically 
aim to overcome different limitations of the charge storage process.
