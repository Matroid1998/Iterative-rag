Description:
An adsorption product with similar 13C chemical shifts to carbamic acid and ammonium bicarbonate.

Text:
For aminefunctionalised materials, the 13C chemical 
shifts give poor differentiation between closely related ammonium carbamate, carbamic acid, 
and ammonium bicarbonate adsorption products, with the signals from these species showing 
very similar 13C chemical shifts.17,18 A similar problem arises for bicarbonate and carbonate 
products in hydroxidebased materials.20 The prediction of NMR parameters with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations21 can improve confidence in the structural assignments, 
and more advanced multinuclear NMR experiments can give improved differentiation 
between adsorption products.17,19,22 However, there remains a pressing need for the 
exploration of new NMR methods for understanding CO2 capture chemistry.23 
A representative emerging class of CO2 adsorbents are aminefunctionalised metalorganic 
frameworks.

Description:
A proposed CO2 adsorption product in amine-functionalized dobpdc materials.

Text:
The framework M2(dobpdc) (dobpdc  4,4dioxidobiphenyl3,3dicarboxylate) 
(Figure 1a) can straightforwardly be functionalised with amines to yield a family of (amine)
M2(dobpdc) adsorbents (Figure 1b).14 These adsorbents have large capacities for selective and 
reversible CO2 uptake, and the adsorption thermodynamics can be tuned by varying the 
amine,11,2427 and the metal.14,28,29 Importantly, these materials generally display steep 
adsorption isotherms making them promising for a range of energy efficient carbon capture 
applications.24,25 Initial characterisation of CO2 adsorption modes in these materials has 
revealed a rich chemistry, with three CO2 adsorption products proposed to date (i) 
ammonium carbamate chains (Figure 1c), thought to be the dominant product in a range of
