Description:
Compounds synthesized through biocatalytic processes involving halohydrin dehalogenases.

Text:
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) have recently distinguished themselves as powerful enzymes for the 
asymmetric diversification of oxyfunctionalized synthons.18 In nature, these bacterial lyases catalyze the reversible 
dehalogenation of haloalcohols through formation of the corresponding epoxides.9 More importantly, they are 
capable of accepting a number of anionic C, N, O, and Snucleophiles in the reverse reaction, i.e. epoxide ring 
opening, giving access to a large repertoire of valuable products.10 For instance, recent impressive biocatalytic 
examples for the application of HHDHs in asymmetric synthesis include the preparation of enantiopure 
nitroalcohols11, and thiiranes12, as well as the desymmetrization of 2substituted1,3dichloro2propanols with 
subsequent cyanatemediated ring opening to afford optically pure epoxides and oxazolidinones1 among others.
