This 
development highlights the progress in producing 
hydrogen 
peroxide 
through 
photocatalysis.28 
However, some of those systems show relatively 
low catalytic activity toward water oxidation for 
H2O2 production. Also, decomposition of produced 
H2O2 by photogenerated electronsholes and UV 
light is also a concern in certain cases. In order to 
achieve largescale hydrogen peroxide production, 
it is crucial to build catalysts that can effectively 
oxidise water to hydrogen peroxide while 
maintaining high stability and durability. Hence, 
developing inexpensive photocatalytic systems 
that can generate H2O2 through water oxidation is 
very critical for realizing practical implementation 
particularly for bulk scale application.

Description:
Produced through photoirradiation of water in the presence of oxygen using RF(COOH)2 resins as catalyst.

Text:
Very recently, resorcinolformaldehyde (RF)based 
functional resins have been reported as cost 
effective and efficient catalytic system with the 
capability of H2O2 production in the presence of 
visible light.2933 In their remarkable pioneering 
work, Shiraishi et al. reported 296 molhg 
production of H2O2 through photoirradiation of 
water in the presence of oxygen using RF(COOH)2 
resins30 as catalyst and solar simulator as light 
source.30 Following the doping of P3HT, the 
catalytic activity of resorcinolformaldehyde resins 
increased to 615 molhg, marking a notable 
enhancement.34 These resins are capable of 
absorbing light with wavelengths extending up to 
approximately 700 nm 34 through simulation of 
visible light radiation in water with an O2
