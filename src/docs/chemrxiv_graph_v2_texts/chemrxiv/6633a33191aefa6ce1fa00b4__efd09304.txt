Description:
The primary organosulfur compound in garlic extract with diverse therapeutic properties.

Text:
Diallylthiosulfinate (DT), commonly known as allicin, is the primary organosulfur compound 
present in garlic (Allium sativum) extract. DT possesses a diverse range of therapeutic 
properties, including antiinflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, rheumatological, wound 
healing and gastrointestinal (GI) ulcer inhibition properties 1,2. However, a significant 
challenge in utilizing DT is its poor stability in aqueous solutions, which hampers its 
bioavailability 3. DT functions as a reactive sulfur molecule in the cellular environment of 
microbes and interacts with thiolcontaining proteins via Sthioallylation. Additionally, it 
depletes the glutathione pool by reacting with glutathione. Conversely, when DT is metabolized 
in the human body, it creates hydrogen sulfide, or H2S. As a gastrotransmitter, this H2S 
functions as a chemical messenger in the somatic body, interacting with several physiological 
and pathological processes 4.
