Description:
Fluorotelomer compounds have been frequently detected in the environment.

Later, Endo and Goss9 recalibrated 
the solute descriptors for FTOHs, which were evaluated again by 
Abraham and Acree.12 In addition, descriptors for very short 
PFAS (C3, mostly refrigerants) have been reported,13,14 and the 
ABSOLV database on the website10 lists descriptor values for 
several per and polyfluorinated alkanes and alcohols of 
unknown origin. Solute descriptors are unavailable for other 
PFAS, including those that have been frequently detected in the 
environment such as other fluorotelomer compounds and 
perfluoroalkanesulfonamides 
(PFASAs) 
with 
different 
substitution patterns.1517 
In a previous study, our group measured the values of KHxdair, 
hence L in eq 1, for 64 neutral PFAS to elucidate their nonpolar 
interaction properties.18 The study showed that L can be 
explained by summing the contributions from the fluorinated 
and nonfluorinated parts of the molecule.
