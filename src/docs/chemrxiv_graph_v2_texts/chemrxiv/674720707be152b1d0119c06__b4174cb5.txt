Description:
Used in the sol-gel synthesis of nanoparticles for enzyme-based nanobiosensors.

The 
physicochemical detector can be any transducer that can convert the biorecognition event into a 
measurable signal, such as an optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric, or thermal signal11,12. Biosensors 
have many advantages over conventional analytical methods, such as simplicity, speed, low cost, high 
sensitivity, and selectivity.Nanomaterials are considered promising candidates for biosensor 
development13. In this study, we developed an enzymebased nanobiosensor for detecting heavy metals using solgel 
synthesis of selenium oxide nanoparticles14 and crude protease enzyme extract from chicken intestine. The biosensor works by measuring the change in temperature after dipping the biosensor in a sample 
containing heavy metals. The change in temperature reflects the interaction between the heavy metals 
and the enzyme, which alters its catalytic activity and heat production15.

Description:
Nanoparticles with high binding affinity for heavy metals such as mercury.

Text:
We chose selenium oxide 
nanoparticles as the nanomaterial for our biosensor because of their high binding affinity with heavy 
metals such as mercury, which facilitates the detection process16. We also chose protease enzyme as 
the biorecognition element for our biosensor because of its wide availability and low cost. Protease 
enzyme is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins17. Heavy metals can 
affect the structure and function of protease enzyme by binding to its thiol groups or other active sites, 
which results in changes in its catalytic activity and heat production18,19.In pursuit of sustainability and 
costeffectiveness, we innovatively synthesized a crude protease enzyme extracted from chicken 
intestine.
