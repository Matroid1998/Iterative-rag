Description:
Involved in the formation of vacancies through thermal treatments in an oxygen depleted atmosphere to enhance PEC activity.

Text:
Compared to stateoftheart oxide 
semiconductors1 used for solar water splitting, pristine hematite presents low efficiency because of the 
reduced hole mean free path ( 2  4 nm) and poor surface kinetics related to a complex oxygen evolution 
reaction (OER).26 It was demonstrated that surface kinetics during SWS can be tuned by controlling the 
surface states nature using various approaches doping,79 hetero and nanostructuring,1014 annealing,15,16 
catalyst film coating,1722 etc. In particular the synergic effect between Tidoping and induced oxygen 
vacancies through thermal treatments during or post growth under oxygen depleted atmosphere has 
shown its efficiency.2327 Various mechanisms were suggested to contribute to the enhancement of PEC 
activity.

Description:
Vacancies generated by nitrogen treatment in hematite, leading to increased carrier density.

Text:
Zhao et al.24 have shown that by annealing pristine and Tidoped hematite photoanodes in Nitrogen 
gas at 600C the photocurrent is increased by 200  and 67  respectively. They assigned this enhancement 
to oxygen vacancies generated by nitrogen treatment, leading to carrier density increase. Opposite 
behaviors were found for the charge transfer processes, comparing pristine hematite and Tidoped 
hematite, suggesting increased transfer resistance for the later one. To the contrary, Wang et al.26 
demonstrated strong electrocatalytic surface contribution of the induced oxygen vacancies along to the 
expected improvement of the bulk conductivity. Such divergences arise from the variety of the employed 
sample preparation methods, leading to different sensitivities to subtle surface effects. These conclusions 
are obtained from PEC macroscopic measurements only, nanoscale information being absent.
