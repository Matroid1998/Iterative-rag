Carboxylic acids and their derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) are 
ubiquitous in biology, playing important roles in facilitating protein 
synthesis,1 regulating lipid homeostasis,2 and mediating cellular 
signaling pathways.3 Beyond natural systems, these related 
functional groups are valuable synthetic handles4 and as such, have 
demonstrated 
utility 
in 
pharmaceuticals,5 
polymers,6 
and 
agrochemicals (Figure 1A).7 With such widespread applications, the 
selective incorporation of carboxyl moieties from activated CH 
bonds offers a promising, streamlined strategy to access these 
valuable carbonylcontaining groups. Despite the tremendous 
advancements in CH functionalization,8 the direct C(sp3)H 
carboxylation remains a challenging transformation.
