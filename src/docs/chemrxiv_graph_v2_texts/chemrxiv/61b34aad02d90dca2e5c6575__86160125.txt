Description:
Activated using photocatalysts with widebandgap semiconductors.

Text:
Remarkable efforts have been directed towards achieving efficient CO2 
activating with photocatalysts by using widebandgap semiconductors, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, ZnO, SiC, ZnS, etc 2, 
3. Besides, the heterogeneous include metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) in addition to the oxide semiconductors 
such as MIL101, ZIF8 and UiO66 4, 5 have been recently employed as photocatalysts611, since the modifcation 
of the coordination chemistry, energy bandgap, organic ligands, and composition of metal clusters can regulate light 
absorption and charge separation. 12 It is known that MIL(125)NH2 (Ti) has a preferable photocatalytic effect upon 
light excitation, which was consisted of titanium clusters coordinated to the organic linkers, i.e., 2aminoterephthalic 
acid.
