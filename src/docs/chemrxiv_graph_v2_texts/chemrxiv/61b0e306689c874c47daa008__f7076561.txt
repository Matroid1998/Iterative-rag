Description:
A chemical method used for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.

Text:
The high heterogeneity of this substrate, 
and the related recalcitrance toward bioprocessing,8 imposed the adoption of an initial pretreatment 
in lignocellulose biorefineries, with the goal of reducing the complexity of the initial feedstock by 
disassembling lignocellulose structure,8,9 before further conversion of the intermediates toward 
valuable end products (e.g. paper, bioethanol,10 levulinic acid,11 5HMF,12 furfural,12 phenol,13,14 
bionaphta15, etc.). While several methods were developed for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic 
biomass, including physical methods (e.g. milling,16,17 ultrasonication18), chemical methods (e.g. alkaline,19,20 acid,21,22 organosolv,23,24, ionic liquids25) or mechanicalphysicochemical methods 
(e.g. steam explosion,26 ammonia fiber explosion27), the vast majority of them focused on the 
valorization of the carbohydrate fraction of biomass.
