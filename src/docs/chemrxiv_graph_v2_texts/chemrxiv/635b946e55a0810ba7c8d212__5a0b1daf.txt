Description:
Cathodes that undergo drastic morphological changes during cycling.

LiS cathodes undergo 
64 
drastic morphological changes during cycling and therefore applying 3D modelling frameworks to 
65 
the various microstructures present in the system is even more critical than for relatively 
66 
dimensionally stable electrodes (as in PEM fuel cells or intercalation electrodes in Li ion 
67 
batteries), even though it is well known that imagebased modelling can have significant benefits 
68 
over volume averaged methods, even in these morphologically stable systems. 69
