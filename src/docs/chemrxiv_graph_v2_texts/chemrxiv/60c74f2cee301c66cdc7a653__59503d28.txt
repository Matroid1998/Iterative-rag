Description:
A semiconductor material suitable for thin film synthesis via chemical vapor deposition.

Text:
Given a bandgap in UV (5.9 eV), the sp2hybridized forms of boron nitride 
(sp2BN) 1, hexagonal BN (hBN) and rhombohedral BN (rBN) are promising thin 
film materials for application in UVoptoelectronics. As for the other 1315 
semiconductor materials AlN, GaN, and InN, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a 
suitable thin film synthesis route for sp2BN. However, deposition of crystalline sp2
BN films by thermal CVD often requires deposition temperatures above 1200 C.29 
This limits the choice of substrate materials for epitaxy seen from demonstrated 
growth on 3CSiC(111), 4H and 6HSiC(0001) and Al2O3(0001). From this perspective zirconium diboride ZrB2 with a hexagonal AlB2type 
structure10 is an interesting alternative seen from a melting point of 3245 C that is 
favorable in hightemperature CVD processes.
