Description:
The smallest Paquette's sultam.

Text:
Recently, we have reported the preparation of its 
isomer  2thia1azabicyclo2.1.1hexane 2,2dioxide (3), the 
smallest Paquettes sultam.18 
We anticipated that bicyclic system 4 could be constructed in an 
efficient and atomeconomy manner through intramolecular 
photochemical 2  2 cycloaddition of appropriately substituted 
diene 5 (Scheme 1, A). Notably, intramolecular photochemical 
2  2 cycloaddition was used to construct fused bicyclic sultams 
previously (Scheme 1, B);19 its application for the synthesis of 
bridged bicyclic systems was hereto unknown. Nevertheless, we 
have been inspired by the fact that a similar method was used to 
obtain 2,4methanoproline 1 and other 2,4methanopyrrolidines 
(Scheme 1, C).9, 11,2024
