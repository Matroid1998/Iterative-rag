Therefore, the objectives of this work are to investigate the impact of incorporating 
environmentally friendly iron into birnessite phases on the crystal structure, electrochemical 
reaction mechanisms, and performance. Wellcrystallized birnessitetype phases with varying 
iron content were synthesized and a detailed study on the structure and iron local environment 
for each phase was performed using complementary techniques, including Xray diffraction, 
Mssbauer, Xray absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Operando Xray absorption 
spectroscopy experiments were performed at both Mn and Fe edges to reveal the nature of the 
redox mechanisms upon cycling in neutral electrolyte. Finally, the rate capability, longterm
