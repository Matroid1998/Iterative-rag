Description:
Has a viscosity of 18 mPas, lower than EMITFSI.

Among the different ILs used, those 
based on the anion bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) have been very popular 
because of their high thermal and electrochemical stabilities 8. For example, the 
decomposition 
temperature 
of 
lbutyl3methylimidazolium 
bis
(trifluromethanesulflonyl)imide (C4mimTFSI) has been reported to be 450, which is 
much more thermally stable than carbonate based solvents 9. However, ILs involving the 
TFSI anions are highly viscous and cause corrosion to the aluminium cathode current 
collector 10,11. It has been found that ILs involving bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI), an 
anion which is the close structural analogue to that of the TFSI, shows a significantly lower 
viscosity than TFSI analogues (e.g., EMIFSI 18 mPas; EMITFSI  33 mPas) 12
14. 19 Furthermore, FSI has less problems of aluminium corrosion 15,16.
