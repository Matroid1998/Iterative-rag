Since its first report as new leadfree ferroelectric material in 2011 by Bske et al.,1 
dopedHfO2 (dopedhafnia), and also its oxide sister ZrO2,2 has been regarded as a very 
promising functional oxide in a myriad of applications, including FeRAM,3 MEMs,4 
NEMs,5 energy harvesting,6 etc.7 At standard conditions, HfO2 crystallizes into a stable 
monoclinic phase (m). It goes through a tetragonal (t) and a cubic phase (c) structure 
transformation, which entails a large volume change, for increasing temperatures.8 While 
the t and cphases share the VIII coordination of the parent fluorite structure, the m
