Description:
An isotope of hydrogen used in NMR for isotopic labeling and studying dynamic processes.

Text:
Deuterium 
(2H) NMR is particularly useful, since it is straightforward 
and inexpensive to introduce 2H isotopic labels using deu
terated solvents, and the 2H NMR parameters and spectra 
are affected by dynamic processes on a broad range of 
timescales.6,7 Dynamics on a similar rate to the width of 2H 
NMR spectra (10100s kHz) results in changes to the 2H 
NMR spectrum lineshape, which can potentially distin
guish between alternative motional models, while spin
lattice (T1) relaxation times are sensitive for faster dynam
ics (on the order of the 2H NMR frequency, typically 100s 
MHz). The NMR data cannot, however, be directly invert
ed to obtain the molecular motions involved.
