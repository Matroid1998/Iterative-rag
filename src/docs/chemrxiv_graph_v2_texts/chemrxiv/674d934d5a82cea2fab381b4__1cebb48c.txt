valorisation.12,39,44,45 Among those, compact artificial leaves have emerged as promising alternatives to unassisted water 
splitting and CO2 conversion, as they bridge the gap between the performance of bulky PVelectrolysis systems and the 
separation and recovery challenges of photocatalytic powder suspensions.46 Despite the rich product scope, most
