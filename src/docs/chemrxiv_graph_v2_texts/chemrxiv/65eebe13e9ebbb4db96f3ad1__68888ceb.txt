Description:
Has a higher dissolution rate under PEMWE conditions, constraining its long-term stability.

Although alternative materials such as ruthenium can show superior OER activity in acidic media compared to iridium, the higher dissolution 
rate of Ru under PEMWE conditions strongly constrains its longterm stability.2,3 However, the scarcity of iridium still limits the widespread 
and largescale implementation of PEMWE.4,5 
A scaleup of the annual implementation of PEMWE to 10 GW using stateoftheart electrolyzers with loadings of 2 mgIr cm2, would require 
7.5 t of iridium,5 whereas the global iridium supply in 2022 only amounted to 6.8 t per year.6 Calculations considering the scarcity of iridium 
and the projected scaleup to the GWscale reveal that an iridiumspecific power density of 50  100 kW gIr1 is required for a successful 
adoption of PEMWE.79 The iridiumspecific power density in recent publications ranges between 9  16 kW gIr1.5,8,10 Thus, the iridium 
utilization must be ultimately enhanced for a future scaleup of PEMWE.
