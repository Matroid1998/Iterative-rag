Description:
Formulated as mixed metal oxide with catalytic activity.

Nevertheless, the 
largescale use of these materials is severely 
hindered by their rarity, high cost, and 
susceptibility to degradation in both acidic and 
alkaline environments.8 
In response to the demand for more sustainable 
electrocatalysts, 
research 
has 
increasingly 
focused on the development of industrially viable 
alternatives 
based 
on 
inexpensive 
earth
abundant metal compounds. Notably, 3d to 5d 
transition 
metal 
oxides, 
particularly 
those 
incorporating Co, Ni, Fe, Cu and W,913 have 
garnered significant attention due to their 
impressive catalytic activity and robust longterm 
durability, especially when formulated as mixed 
metal (e.g., NiCo,14,15 NiFe,15 CoFe,16,17 Cu
Co,18,19 CuW,20 NiW,21,22 FeW,23 CoW,24 
FeNiW,25 CoNiFe,26 CoNiW,27 CoFe
W,28,29 CoCuW30,31) oxides.
