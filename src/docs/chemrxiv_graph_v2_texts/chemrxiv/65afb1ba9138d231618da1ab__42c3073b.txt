Description:
Layered double hydroxide studied as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Text:
As the pivotal halfreaction of electrolytic water for energy conversion devices, the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER) with sluggish multistep electron transfer kinetics calls for the 
development of highly active electrocatalysts.1 Till now, the most widely studied OER 
catalysts are metal (hydro)oxides, such as IrOx2, Co3O41b, 3 and NiFe layered double
