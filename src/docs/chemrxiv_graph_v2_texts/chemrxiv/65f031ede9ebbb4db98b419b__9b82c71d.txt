Description:
Used to coat carbon fibers via electrophoretic deposition to improve flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength.

Text:
Similarly, Bhanuprakash et al. 11 reported 25 and 47 
improvement in flexural strength and ILSS with CFs coated by graphene oxide (GO) via EPD. Regarding the fibre sizing method, GRMs were dispersed in the fibre sizing and then coated 
onto the CFs, which also contributed to significant enhancements in flexural properties and 
ILSS 6,7,10. In addition, Zhang et al. 14 reported synergy effect by using CNT, GO and Ag 
nanoparticle, combining electrodeposition and chemical grafting, and the CFAgGOCNTs 
one resulted with the 69.7 higher interfacial shear strength (IFSS) compared with the
