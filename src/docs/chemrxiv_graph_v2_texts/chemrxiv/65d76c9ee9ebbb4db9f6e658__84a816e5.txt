Description:
Anions that perform poorly in catalytic transfer alumination, leading to the formation of new fluorinated compounds.

Text:
Pleasingly, the catalytic CH metalation of 2a using 8 
and 10 mol (Et3N)HB(C6F5)4 proceeded cleanly to give aryl aluminum 9a as the major product on heating to 80 C 
(Table 3, entry 1). Importantly, in the absence of (Et3N)HB(C6F5)4 no CH alumination was observed (entry 2). This 
process thus represents the first report of catalytic transfer alumination. A comparison study then was performed using 
the two (R3N)HAnion salts that performed best as activators in CH zincation. With 8, better conversions were again 
achieved using (Et3N)HB(C6F5)4 compared to the (DMT)H salt. The poor performance of salts with B(ArCF3)4 
anions (entry 4 and 5) in this case is notable, with insitu reaction monitoring revealing the formation of several new 
fluorinated compounds (by 19F NMR spectroscopy).

Description:
Used in CH alumination and involves fluoride abstraction.

Text:
The difference in CH alumination using B(ArCF3)4 and 
B(C6F5)4, is consistent with the considerable fluorophilicity of aluminum cations that presumably leads to AlF bond 
formation by fluoride abstraction from the sp3CF3containing anion (note, this is not observed with the zinc congeners 
at 80 C, consistent with the lower fluorophilicity of Zn relative to Al). Table 3. CH alumination of 2methylthiophene.a
