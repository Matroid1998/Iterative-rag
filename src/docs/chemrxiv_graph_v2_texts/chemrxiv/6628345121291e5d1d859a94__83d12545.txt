Description:
A compound screened for reactivity in bioorthogonal chemistry.

Text:
These datasets are employed to screen for desired 
properties or to develop machine learning models for rapid predictions. Within the eld of 
bioorthogonal chemistry, Stuyver and Coley recently utilized a large library of (23) 
cycloadditions11 to screen for biocompatible click reactions.12 In our study, we developed a 
straightforward computational workow that allows for eicient screening of 1,2,4,5tetrazine 
reactivity. Using this method, we generated an initial dataset of 1,288 reaction barriers between
