Description:
Used in oxidative fusion reactions to obtain benzannulated azanhelicenes.

Text:
We recently reported oneshot oxidative fusion reactions 
of orthophenylenebridged oligopyrroles to afford various 
heterocirculenes and heterohelicenes.14,15) Notably, tetra
aza8circulenes, with planar structures excluding any ste
rically encumbering substituents, are fairly soluble in THF 
and DMSO.16) This property arises from effective hydrogen
bonding interactions between the pyrrolic NH site and the 
Hbond accepting solvent molecule. Inspired by this molec
ular design principle, we report a synthetic challenge for 
longer azahelicenes with outerpointing pyrrolic NH sites. By exploiting the oneshot oxidative fusion reactions of suit
ably designed indoleterminated acyclic oligopyrroles (vide 
infra), a series of benzannulated azanhelicenes were ob
tained. This structure is suitable for suppressing the
