Description:
Known as a very active cocatalyst for hydrogen generation.

Text:
They serve as precursors for Pt 
nanoparticles and nanowires, substrates to obtain metalorganic frameworks 4, or even alloy 
nanoclusters if mixed with other metals 2, 59. The Chini clusters can be deposited on diferent 
supports to be used as composite materials in several electrocatalytic application 10, 11 and 
photo and thermocatalytic processes 1216. Platinum is known as very active cocatalyst for hydrogen generation ascribable to its higher work
