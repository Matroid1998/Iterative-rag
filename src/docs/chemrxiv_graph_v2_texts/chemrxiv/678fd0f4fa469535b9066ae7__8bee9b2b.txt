Description:
An anion with the formula C2H3O.

IR cryoSEVI spectra of the 
vinoxide (C2H3O) and nitrate (NO3) anions have recently been reported.2324 Here, the application 
of this method to vinylidene along with quantum dynamics simulations provides new insight into 
the vibrational and electronic structure of H2CC and H2CC. The PES of vinylidene was first measured by the Lineberger group, who observed vibrationally 
resolved transitions to several lowlying electronic states of the neutral.12, 21 They found anomalous 
broadening of peaks in the H2CC ! ! electronic ground state compared to those of the lowlying 
 state. Since the barrier to isomerization on the triplet state is predicted to be significantly 
larger (2 eV),2529 the ground state broadening was attributed to rapid (200 fs) isomerization of 
vinylidene to acetylene.
