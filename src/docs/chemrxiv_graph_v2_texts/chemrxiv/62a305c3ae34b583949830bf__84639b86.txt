Description:
A small molecule with a high NH bond dissociation free energy of 100.3 kcal/mol.

Text:
Ammonia (NH3) and water (H2O) are ubiquitous small mole
cules that represent one of the pillars from which life on Earth 
sustains.1 Due to their widespread presence, they have been 
identified as energy units or economic building blocks en route 
to highvalue compounds.2 However, their chemical manipula
tion is nontrivial, as a result of the high bond dissociation free 
energy (BDFE) of their NH and OH bonds (BDFEOH in H2O 
 113.0 kcalmol1; BDFENH in NH3  100.3 kcalmol1).3 In
deed, the majority of the approaches towards XH cleavage fo
cus on polar pathways; for example, both d and pblock ele
ments undergo oxidative addition4 or deprotonation through 
metalligand cooperation4c, 5 using the twoelectrons of the re
spective d and porbitals (Fig. 1A).

Description:
Activated by Bi REC resulting in well-defined Bi(III) amido compounds.

Text:
Herein we report on the 
synthesis, reactivity and structural characterization of a Bi REC, 
whose BiO homolyzes reversibly at room temperature without 
the need for irradiation (Fig. 1D). We demonstrate that such 
complex permits fast, and mild activation of ammonia and wa
teramong other alcohols and aminesresulting in wellde
fined Bi(III) amido and alkoxy compounds. We suggest that 
upon coordination to Bi(II), ammines and alcohols undergo X
H bond weakening, thus permitting their facile radical activa
tion. In addition, we propose that the novel pincerbased 
Bi(III)NR2 compounds show reactivity with a triad of H, H 
and H sources.

Description:
A viable building block in chemical synthesis upon activation.

Text:
This rich and broad reactivity opens the door to 
the design of strategies for transferring and manipulating the 
NH2 moiety upon ammonia activation, a highly coveted and im
portant process toward considering NH3 as viable building 
block.
