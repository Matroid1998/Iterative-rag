Description:
Produced from electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Text:
Rising living standards, thriving industries, and increased transportation in emerging and developed 
economies have resulted in a recordhigh energy demand, which is mostly met by the combustion of fossil fuels. As a result, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are causing a severe environmental crisis and a threat to social 
development. Electrocatalytic CO2 (CO2RR) reduction has emerged as a viable and potential transformative 
technology to close the carbon cycle. Although the production of hydrocarbons (methanol, ethanol, ethylene etc.)
