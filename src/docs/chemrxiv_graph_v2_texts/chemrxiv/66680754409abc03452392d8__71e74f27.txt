Sulfur (VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry has emerged as a valuable tool in 
32 
organic synthesis and biochemistry (116). Notably, sulfamoyl fluorides have increasingly 
33 
become pivotal building blocks in the SuFEx domain due to their unique properties, 
34 
including chemical stability and selective reactivity at the sulfur center (1). Recently, 
35 
researchers have utilized sulfamoyl fluorides as efficient linkers to facilitate the assembly 
36 
of sulfonyl derivatives, such as sulfamides, sulfonamides, and sulfamates (1718) (Figure 
37 
1a, left). The distinctive reactivity of sulfamoyl fluoride is anticipated to streamline the 
38 
challenges associated with the multistep synthesis of sulfonyl derivatives (19), thereby 
39 
garnering significant attention towards the synthesis of sulfamoyl fluorides.
