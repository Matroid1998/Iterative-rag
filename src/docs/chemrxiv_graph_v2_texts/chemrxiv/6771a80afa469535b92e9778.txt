Text:
Calcium acetate (Ca(CH3COO)2) can be made by reacting CaCO3 or CaO with acetic acid 
(CH3COOH). Ca(CH3COO)2 can be used medicinally to treat high levels of phosphate in dialysis 
patients.7 Ca(CH3COO)2 can also be used in the preparation of hydroxyapatite,8 which is used for 
biomedical applications such as bone and coatings of metal implants, and is an approved food 
additive in Canada, as an acidity regulator.9 Ca(CH3COO)2 can be used as an environmentally 
friendly deicer in place of NaCl, however, it is currently not a commercial deicer.
