Description:
A component of peptide nucleic acid probes, replacing the sugar phosphate backbone with a peptide backbone.

For these reasons, it is 
essential to further improve technologies that allow the direct detection of miRNAs and 
the detection of isomiRs. In response to these challenges, in recent years, we have focused our efforts on 
developing Dynamic Chemistry Labelling (DCL) as a methodology for miRNA detection 
with singlebase resolution. DCL serves as an enzymefree and versatile isomiR detection 
method that can be applied to several biological samples, including serum, plasma, cell 
lysates and fixed cells1720. DCL is based on the use of abasic peptide nucleic acid (PNA) 
probes. These PNA probes are known mimics of nucleic acids, but instead of a sugar
phosphate backbone, they have a peptide backbone composed of N(2
aminoethyl)glycine units21.
