Description:
Used as a chemical fuel in PEMFCs, where it undergoes oxidation at the anode.

Text:
While BEVs 
currently dominate the electric vehicle market, PEMFCs offer a viable 
alternative for applications where BEVs encounter limitations, such 
as in heavyduty trucks.5 PEMFCs convert hydrogen as a chemical fuel 
directly into electricity by employing two electrochemical reactions 
oxidation of hydrogen in the anode (Eq. 1) and reduction of oxygen 
in cathode (Eq. 2). H2  2H  2e (anode)
