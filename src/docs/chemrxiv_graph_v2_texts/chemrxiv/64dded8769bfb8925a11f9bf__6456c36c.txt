Description:
Organic molecules with sp2 CH bonds that are challenging to selectively functionalize.

Text:
Our ability to selectively activate and functionalize CH bonds in organic molecules is fundamental 
to countless chemical processes.1 Despite notable advances in this field, strategies for the selective 
functionalization of sp2 CH bonds of alkenes are underdeveloped.29 This limitation can be traced 
back to fundamental selectivity issues that emerge on reaction of alkenes with singlesite transition 
metal complexes. Coordination of the alkene to the metal is often kinetically accessible and non
reversible (Figure 1).
