Description:
A catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO due to its high activity and selectivity.

Text:
For example, it can be used as an intermediate product for the further reduction to 
ethylene7,8 However, due to the high stability of CO2 and the requirement of electron and proton
transfers for its transformation, catalysts need to overcome the slow kinetics, yielding low 
overpotential and high product selectivity. Silver (Ag) has been the metal of choice as catalyst for the CO2RR to CO due to its high activity, 
selectivity,5 and drastically lower cost compared to gold (Au). Having the second optimal binding 
energy for the key intermediate of COOH, which is essential in the CO2RR process to CO, Ag is slightly 
less efficient than Au for CO2RR to CO.9 Even though Ag is not a CRM (critical raw material), its 
considerable cost is a burden for upscaling.
