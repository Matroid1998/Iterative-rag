Description:
A moderately hydrophobic polymer used as the B block in ABA triblock copolymers.

Text:
In particular, ABA triblock 
copolymers featuring poly(2methyl2oxazoline) (pMeOx) as hydrophilic A block and 
moderately hydrophobic poly(2nbutyl2oxazoline) (pBuOx), poly(2nbutyl2oxazine) 
(pBuOzi) or poly(2npropyl2oxazoline) (pPrOx) show very promising properties such as high
