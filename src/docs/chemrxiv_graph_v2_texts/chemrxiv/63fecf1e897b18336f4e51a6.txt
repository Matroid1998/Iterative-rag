Description:
Used as an oxidant, with water as the theoretical byproduct when reduced, but poses a high risk of explosions in manufacturing due to its role in combustion.

To overcome this issue, using molecular oxygen existing in air as an oxidant is one of 
the ideal solutions 10,11. When oxygen is reduced, the generated byproduct is 
theoretically only water. This methodology can realize a high atomeconomy process. However, using oxygen as an oxidant has a high risk of explosions especially when 
employed on a manufacturing scale 12 due to the presence of two out of the three 
elements of combustion, namely combustibles, oxygen supply and ignition source 13. If unexpected ignition occurs, e.g. due to static electricity from operators or the 
equipment, the result could be disastrous. To avoid this safety risk 14, using oxygen 
in batch manufacturing is very limited.
