Description:
A commonly used PET radionuclide with a short half-life of 68 minutes.

Nuclear medicine imaging plays an important role in new drug developments, both at preclin
ical and early clinical stages.2 Presently, fluorine18(18F), and gallium68(68Ga) are the most
used positron emission tomography(PET) radionuclides for molecular imaging studies in nu
clear medicine.3 PET permits noninvasive localization and quantification with relatively
small amounts of radioactivity, due to its high inherent sensitivity. The short halflives of
both these radionuclides (110 and 68 minutes, respectively), however, pose limitations for
imaging biochemical processes with slow pharmacokinetics, such as localization of macro
molecules at targeted tissues in macromolecularbased (e.g. antibodies) cancer therapies.4
On the other hand, Zirconium89 (89Zr) is suitable for radiolabelling and invivo visualiza
tion of such processes due to its relatively long halflife (78.4h), which matches the slow
