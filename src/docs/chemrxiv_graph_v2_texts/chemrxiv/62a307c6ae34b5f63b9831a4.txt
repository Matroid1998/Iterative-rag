Description:
A compound with a redox potential of 1.3 V vs FcFc couple.

Text:
In order to 
avoid the subsequent reduction to gold(I), the authors used 
cobaltocene (E  1.3 V vs FcFc couple) which matched the 
redox potential for the first reduction potential of the gold(III) 
complex.17 The only reactivity of gold(II) complexes studied so 
far was based on electron transfer processes.17 It could be 
expected that complexes with a labile coordination site could 
coordinate reactive molecules and thus promote some reactivity 
beyond the electron transfer. Therefore, we aimed at exploring 
the preparation and properties of gold(II) complexes with 
bidentate and tridentate ligands.
