Description:
Used as a solvent under harsh conditions in some photochemical reactions.

Considering our constant 
interest in sulfurcontaining heterocycles and their chemistry 511, we have found that more than 
20 different types of such Sheterocycles can be obtained photochemically, and among them, the 
benzothiazoles are definitely the most developed. They are privileged and versatile heterocyclic 
scaffolds with extensive applications in pharmaceutical industry and materials science. As of 
November 2024, Reaxys database showed approximately 340k compounds mentioned in 196k 
documents related to chemical space of 1,3benzothiazoles. There are several early works published 
in 1982 12 and 1997 13 using ultraviolet (UV)lightinduced intramolecular aromatic substitutions 
of 2bromoiodothiobenzanilides to benzothiazoles. The application of quartz equipment, high
energy UV light and harsh conditions (in some cases a strong base in liquid ammonia) limits the 
substrate scope and causes unwanted side reaction products.
