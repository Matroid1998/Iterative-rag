. A fully quantitative under
standing of the covalent bond nature is fun
damentally important for describing various
chemical, physical, and biological systems. In
the canonical case of H2 molecule, the bond
is portrayed as a quantum mechanical bound
state of two electrons in the spinsinglet con
figuration, marginally affected by the proton
nuclear spins. Heitler and London estab
lished the initial quantitative description of
the H2 molecule1 within the essentially single
particle (HartreeFock) approximation of the
twoelectron state.

Description:
A homopolar molecule discussed in the context of bond covalency and ionicity.

Such a unique so
lution was possible to achieve with the help of
the invented earlier Exact Diagonalization Ab
Initio (EDABI) method by incorporating into a
single scheme the first (wavefunction) and sec
ond (particle)quantization aspects of the prob
lem at hand into a single coherent scheme.10,11
These results enabled a revision of the concepts
of the bond covalency and ionicity, along with
the introducting the degree of atomicity 7,8 per
sistent upon the bond formation, which in turn
opens up a new path to the complementary
bond characterization via its eigenenergy.2,3,12
Here we demonstrate that the previously de
fined atomicity and true covalency,68 based
on the ideas of the MottHubbard localiza
tion taken from condensed matter13,14 and
nanophysics,10 can be quantitatively related to
the von Neumann entropy for the interacting
and entangled twoelectron states.1517 Essen
tially, we name this entropy as the entangle
ment correlation between the true covalent and
ionic counterparts, thus complementing in the
precise manner the previously introduced con
cepts of atomicity and true covalency.7,8 From
this perspective, our findings extend essentially
the energybased quantum mechanical descrip
tion of the bond, here elaborated in detail for
the homopolar molecule H2.
