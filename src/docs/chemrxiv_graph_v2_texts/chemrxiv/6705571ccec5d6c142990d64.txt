Description:
A gas emitted during the mismanagement of orange juice processing residues, contributing to environmental issues.

Text:
Orange (Citrus sinensis) is the most consumed citrus fruit in the world and ranks fourth 
among all fruits, with a global production estimated at 76 Mt in 2022 1. A considerable share (25
30) of its production is routed to the juice industry 2,3, which generates large amounts of side 
streams 45 to 60 of the fruits are converted into byproducts during processing 4. Mismanaging 
these residues can lead to environmental issues, such as groundwater contamination, disturbance 
of soil microbiome, methane emission and insect proliferation 2,5,6. When not landfilled, the orange 
juice solid waste is destined mainly for lowadded value endings, such as incineration for energy 
recovery and cattle feeding 5,7. Industrially relevant substances like pectin and essential oils may 
also be extracted from orange juice waste 8.
