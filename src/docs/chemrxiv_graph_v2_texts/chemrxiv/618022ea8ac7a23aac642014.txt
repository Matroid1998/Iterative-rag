Description:
Kekul√© proposed the first structure of benzene.

Since Dalton rst proposed his atomic theory, the study of chemistry has been inextrica
bly linked to the study of structure. 1 Soon after Dalton, early organic chemists Kekul and
Couper discovered chemical bonding and invented the notation to represent molecules spa
tially.2 Seven years later, Kekul proposed the rst structure of benzene. 3,4 By developing
a robust understanding of structure, Kekul and Couper paved the way for modern organic
chemistry.5 Later, harnessing Xrays would allow researchers to characterize organic and
inorganic crystals.6 This ability was used to determine the structure of penicillin, which
showed researchers how to create a whole host of betalactam antibiotics and revolutionize
medicine.79
Today, a wide range of experimental methods and theoretical frameworks exist to de
termine molecular, crystal, nanoparticle and mesostructures.
