Description:
An abundant cation associated with carrageenans, important for gel formation.

Text:
The latter

usually occur during the extraction of carrageenans from red seaweed 2. Due to the use of 
50 
different bases, different cations can be associated with the carrageenans. The most abundant 
51 
cations are potassium, sodium and calcium ions 7. The cations are an important factor for the 
52 
aggregation of carrageenan helices during gel formation 8. Thus, they are important for the 
53 
functional properties but possibly also for the physiological properties. 54 
The usually applied classification of carrageenans assumes that only the disaccharide unit 
55 
characteristic of one type of carrageenan is present in the polymer. However, some carrageenans
