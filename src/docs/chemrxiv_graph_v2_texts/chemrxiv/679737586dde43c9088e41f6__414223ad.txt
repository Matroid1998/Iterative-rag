Description:
Photocleavable molecules with structural flexibility allowing precise control of absorption wavelength.

These compounds are useful in 
lightstimulated drug delivery systems, enabling highly controlled 
drug release with precise spatial and temporal resolution.5 
Coumarinbased 
photocleavable 
molecules 
provide 
a 
significant advantage over nitrobenzenebased derivatives due to 
their structural flexibility, enabling precise control of absorption 
wavelength and broader applicability across experimental setups. Typical nitrobenzenebased photocleavable molecules are 
difficult to induce bond cleavage at wavelengths longer than 400 
nm because of the limited chemical modifications of their benzene 
ring.6 In contrast, coumarinbased photocleavable molecules, 
which are relatively easier to modify and have an expandable  
structure, allow for the arbitrary selection of wavelengths in the 
visible light region.4b Despite the advantages of coumarinbased 
derivatives, their persistent and widespread use is hindered by 
lower photocleavage efficiency and potential hydrolytic instability.
