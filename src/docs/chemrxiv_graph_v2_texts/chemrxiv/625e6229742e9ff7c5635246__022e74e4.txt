Description:
An excellent electrocatalyst for HER due to its thermoneutrality for hydrogen adsorption.

Text:
The differences in the catalytic activities of metals towards HER in an acidic medium (0.5M 
H2SO4) is assumed to be explainable via the Sabatier Principle.1 According to the Sabatier 
principle, HER activity depends on metalhydrogen (EMH) binding strength, which leads to 
a volcano type plot when using EMH as a descriptor of the activity of metals for HER.2 In 
this scenario, metals like Pt or Ptgroup metals are excellent electrocatalysts for HER due to 
their thermoneutrality for hydrogen adsorption (optimum metalhydrogen binding energy 
leads to EMH 0 eV).3 But this reasoning cannot be extended to the alkaline HER, 
particularly it fails to explain the sluggish reaction kinetics of HER on Pt in alkaline media.

Description:
A metal whose hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics are pH dependent.

Text:
In the past, several hypothesis have been put forward to explain the pH dependency of 
HER kinetics on Pt.511 It was initially suggested that the stronger PtH binding energy in 
alkaline media, which can be corelated to shifts in the HUPD peaks with pH,7 is the sole reason 
for the slower rate of HER in alkaline electrolytes., However, it was later shown that the 
EMH is an inherent property of a metal, and the variations in HUPD peak positions are due to 
the competitive mechanism between H and water adsorption, where the latter becomes 
weaker at high alkalinity.7,8,11 Alternatively, specific adsorption of cations and their different 
capability in stabilizingdestabilizing OH has also been proposed as the origin of shift in the 
HUPD peaks.12 
In a different work, the binding energy of PtH2O instead of PtH binding energy was 
taken considered to explain the pH dependent HER kinetics of Pt in a highly alkaline 
medium.
