Description:
Vacancies in MoS2 have been proposed to enhance its electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions.

Text:
MoS2 shows a high selectivity towards reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotential when an ionic 
liquid cocatalyst is present in the aqueous electrolyte.12 Increases in electrocatalytic activity of 
MoS2 for CO2RR have been correlated with the existence of defect sites, such as edges and S 
vacancies.14,15 Beyond CO2RR, the electrochemical generation of S vacancies in MoS2 prior to 
conducting HER has been proposed to enhance its electrocatalytic activity.1618 Conventional 
correlations between synthetic control and macroscopic CO2RR performance in the literature do 
not directly probe mechanistic causality.
