Description:
Used in a 1.0 M solution for hydrogen evolution reaction.

In order to avoid or limit
the utilization of fossil fuels, recently, many researchers have proposed more strategies to produce clean fuels
such as hydrogen (H2), Ammonia (NH3), hydrous hydrazine, Metalion batteries from diverse sources using
nanosized materials. In this ways, more recently, Naseeb, W et al 22 have engineered RuCoO heterostructures
nanoparticles anchored over dual heteroatom (N,S) codoped graphene nanosheets named as (RuCoOSNG)
for high catalytic hydrogen production from water electrolysis by direct hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In
1.0 M KOH, RuCoOSNG displayed 90 mV and 10 mA as overpotential and current density under HER
process which was comparable to the stateoftheart (PtC (60 mV)) a long with stability.
