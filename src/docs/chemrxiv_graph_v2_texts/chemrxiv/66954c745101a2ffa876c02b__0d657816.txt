100 fs,9,11,31,32 which causes a characteristic broad UV absorp
tion band in the gas phase.31 The most likely mechanistic expla
nation of this process is the transfer of a proton from the N1 atom
of guanine to the N3 atom of cytosine, which stabilizes the CT
state and eventually leads to a crossing with the ground state in
a barrierless manner.7,9,23,33
Although a direct photoinduced EDPT process is unlikely
in DNA,20 there are spectroscopic indications that it could
be possible within the AU pair in the Aform RNA dou
ble helix.34 The photochemistry of adenine complexes with
uracil (AU) or thymine (AT) has received less attention than
GC,10,13,15,16,27,35 and these have been studied mainly in
the context of the plausibility of the spurious EDPT deacti
vation mechanism.
