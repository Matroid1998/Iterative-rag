Description:
Has high initial reactivity that is roughly temperature independent below 1600 K.

Text:
Graphite, graphene, graphene oxide, carbon 
black, and diamond NPs all were found to have initial reactivities in the same order of 
magnitude, with significant NPtoNP variation attributed to differences in the NP structures and 
surface site distributions. The initial reactivity for graphitic and carbon black NPs was high and 
roughly TNP independent below 1600 K, then fell gradually at higher TNP. One surprise was that under O2 etching conditions, with TNP  1600 K, all graphitic and carbon 
black NPs eventually passivated, i.e., became inert toward further O2 attack, implying that the 
NP surfaces had transformed to be nearly free of reactive, undercoordinated sites.

Description:
Undergoes etching at defects in basal planes when attacked by O2.

Text:
This was 
attributed to evolution of the NPs to have surface layers with fullycoordinated, nanoonion 
(fullerenelike) structures, which are known to form when carbon NPs are annealed.1114 
Experiments with carbon nanoonion NPs found, as expected, that some were initially inert to 
O2, while others had nonzero initial reactivity due to contamination by nononion carbon, but 
passivated rapidly as this contamination etched away. O2 attack at defects in graphite basal planes results in etching at increasing rates as carbon 
removal enlarges the defects into etch pits.59 Thus, we might expect that NPs with passivated
