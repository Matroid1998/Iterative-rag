Description:
A critical component for plant life and a contributor to global warming.

Text:
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a critical component for plant life and thus animal and human life. Combustion of carboncontaining fuels to CO2 allows humans to live almost anywhere on Earth 
and provides power for industrial production. However, as shown in Figure 1, rapid growth of 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations has undesired consequences including global warming where the 
past 40 years have seen temperatures rise at a rate (0.18Cdecade) that is more than twice that 

3
(0.08Cdecade) in the 100 years prior. 1 CO2 emissions from naturally preexisting and 
anthropogenic activities outweigh uptake and sequestration pathways, resulting in a cumulative 
buildup of atmospheric CO2 levels. Thus, global warming, atmospheric CO2 levels, and world 
population are interconnected.
