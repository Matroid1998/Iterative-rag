Description:
In the presence of oxygen, a self-passivating 0.72 nm thick gallium oxide layer forms spontaneously at the exposed interface.

Eutectic GalliumIndium metal alloy (EGaIn) is a nontoxic liquid at room temperature
with a unique combination of rheological, thermal, and electrical properties that makes it
attractive for applications in soft electronics,13 catalysis,4 energy storage5,6 plasmonics,7,8
2Dmaterials synthesis,9 and molecular electronics.1013 In the presence of oxygen, a self
passivating 0.72 nm thick gallium oxide layer forms spontaneously at the exposed interface,
endowing EGaIn with nonNewtonian rheological properties;14,15 as a result, liquid EGaIn
can be molded into various geometries (e.g., micronanosized spheres,15,16 rods,17 and
cones,10 or injected into microchannels11). To incorporate EGaIn into devices, dierent methods have been developed to spatially
manipulate and position EGaIn (e.g., using magnetic elds,1820 microuidics, and conven
tional patterningfabrication techniques11,21,22).
