Description:
A hygroscopic compound with a characteristic relative humidity at which it converts from a solid to a liquid drop, known as the deliquescence point.

Additionally, the interaction of respiratory microdroplets 
carrying pathogens with water vapor impacts respiratory disease transmission.7 Understanding the 
interaction of aerosol particles with water vapor is therefore vital to establish accurate models for 
precipitation, climate change, and aerosol disease transmission.8,9, 10 
Hygroscopicity refers to the ability of an aerosol particle to uptake water vapor from air 
and determines the resulting aerosol particle size as a function of the relative humidity (RH).11, 12 
Many hygroscopic compounds, such as sodium chloride (NaCl) or ammonium sulfate, have a 
characteristic RH at which they convert from a solid to a liquid drop, termed the deliquescence 
point.
