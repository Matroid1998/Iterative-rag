Description:
An element whose emissions need to be reduced to achieve carbon neutrality.

Text:
The 
primary objective of the net zero3 is to achieve carbon neutrality by 
significantly reducing carbon emissions to a level that can be 
absorbed and stored sustainably by natural mechanisms and 
additional carbon dioxide removal methods, thereby ensuring a 
balanced atmospheric carbon footprint of zero. Presently, the energy 
sector is accountable for approximately threequarters of 
greenhouse gas emissions, thus playing a pivotal role in mitigating 
the adverse impacts of climate change.
