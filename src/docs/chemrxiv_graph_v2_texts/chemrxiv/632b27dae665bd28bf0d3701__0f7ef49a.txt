Description:
A material where hydride ion diffusion can occur through oxidative diffusion or with the assistance of oxygen vacancies.

Text:
In BaTiO3xHy two possible mechanisms for hydride ion dif
fusion have been suggested.4,14 The rst can be described as an
oxidative diffusion, where the hydride ion transforms into a pro
ton followed by interstitial diffusion. In the second mechanism
hydride ions move through the material with the assistance of
oxygen vacancies. Several investigations using complementary
methods, such as isotope exchange,5 quantum chemical calcula
tions15, quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS)16 and inelastic
neutron scattering (INS)17 have indicated that the latter mech
anism most likely occurs in BaTiO3xHy oxyhydride and other
