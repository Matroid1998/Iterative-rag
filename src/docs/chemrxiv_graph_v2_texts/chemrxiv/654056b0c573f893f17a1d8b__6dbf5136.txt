Description:
Adsorption potential on microplastics is significantly improved after biodegradation in wastewater treatment processes.

Apart from many en
vironmental factors (e.g., pH, natural organic matter (NOM), and 
salinity), the inherent properties of MPs, such as small size, hydro
phobicity, high surface area, and abundant surface functional 
groups, are believed to facilitate the adsorption of heavy metals on 
MPs 1516, 22. Natural and anthropogenic weathering or degradation can 
greatly alter the surface properties of MPs, thereby affecting their 
affinity toward HMs 1721. For instance, it was found that the ad
sorption potential of MPs for cadmium ions (Cd2) was signifi
cantly improved after being biodegraded in a traditional 
wastewater treatment process 17.
