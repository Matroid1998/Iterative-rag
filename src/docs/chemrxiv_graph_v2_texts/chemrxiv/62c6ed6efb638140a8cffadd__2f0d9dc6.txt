Description:
Groups formed upon oxidation of Lys residues.

Text:
Cys residues
are broadly known to oxidize through the thiol moiety
leading to a wide variety of oxidation products such as
the thiyl radical, the disulde bond or the sulfenic or
sulnic acids.611 In this vein, an antioxidizing charac
ter is commonly attributed to the thiol moiety, due to
its ability to quench oxidizing species.12 A clear biolog
ical example being the Glutathione, a tripeptide found
in dierent organisms, protecting them against oxida
tion.13 On the other hand, Lys residues are less suscep
tible to oxidation and in case of oxidation, the forma
tion of carbonyl groups have been reported.1416 It is
therefore surprising to observe a crosslinker formed by
these pair of residues.
