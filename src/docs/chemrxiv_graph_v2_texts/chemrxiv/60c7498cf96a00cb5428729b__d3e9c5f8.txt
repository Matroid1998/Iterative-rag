Description:
Adopt a bronzelike structure with increased tungsten content.

Text:
This phase represents the last (i.e., highest tungsten content) of the series to 
adopt a WadsleyRoth crystallographic shear (cs) structure (Figure 1). With increased tungsten 
content, the niobium tungsten oxides adopt a bronzelike structure, starting with Nb2WO8.3,4 Up 
to this point, niobium oxide acts a structuredirecting agent, in the sense that Nbrich compounds
