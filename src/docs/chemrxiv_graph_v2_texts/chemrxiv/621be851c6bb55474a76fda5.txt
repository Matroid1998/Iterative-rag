Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted from the power, transportation, and industrial sectors.

Text:
Global efforts for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the past decade have seen
the most success in the electric power sector, while emissions from other sectors have seen
only modest declines or remained stagnant. For example, in the U.S., CO2 emissions from the
power sector declined by 26 during 20082018, while for the same period, transportation
CO2 emissions increased by 1.4 and industrial CO2 emissions decreased by 9.1 Decar
bonization strategies for these sectors often cite electrification as a potential pathway, which
shifts the burden of emissions reduction from these sectors to the power sector, where contin
ued growth of wind and solar generation is expected to further reduce the emissions intensity
of the electricity supply.
