Description:
Compounds characterized by CC and CH bonds with homolytic bond dissociation energy challenges.

Text:
Take for instance, the bonds found in alkanes The CC bond of CH3CH3 has a homolytic 
bond dissociation energy of 90.10.1 kcal mol1.3 Chemoselectivity further complicates CC bond 
activation, with surrounding CH bonds often the first sites to react.
