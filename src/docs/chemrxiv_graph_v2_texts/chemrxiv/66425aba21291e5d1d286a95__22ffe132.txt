Description:
Contains a highly strained atropTyrTrp linkage composed of three amino acid residues.

Text:
However, due to its limited quantity, 
the biological activity of micitide 982 (1) remains unknown. Furthermore, the highly strained atropTyrTrp linkage, 
composed of the three amino acid residues in micitide 982 
(1), is also found in pseudosporamide (2), which was iso
lated in 2020.3 In this study, a new and convenient synthesis 
route for the highly strained atropTyrTrp linkage using lig
andenabled carboxylatedirected CH activation and subse
quent atroposelective Larock macrocyclization was devel
oped. This modular synthesis approach enabled the first to
tal synthesis of micitide 982 (1) and facilitated the straight
forward largescale synthesis of its analogs. Figure 1A illustrates the synthesis strategy of micitide 982 
(1).

Text:
The most challenging aspect of the synthesis of micitide 
982 (1) lies in the construction of the highly strained atrop
TyrTrp linkage composed of three amino acid residues. Re
cently, we reported the atroposelective total synthesis of ci
hunamide B.4 In the total synthesis of cihunamide B, a biaryl 
linkage was established early in the synthesis, followed by 
the construction of the highly strained atropTrpTrp link
age through atroposelective Larock macrocyclization
