Description:
Reinforced into AZ31 magnesium alloy to enhance tensile strength and ductility.

Text:
But due to their poor creep resistance 

behavior at high temperatures, the application of magnesium and its alloys are limited. So in 
order to overcome these limitations and to improve the properties, reinforcements are 
incorporated 910. Dinaharan et al. 11 reinforced titanium particles (0, 7, 14, and 21 vol 
) into an AZ31 magnesium alloy by friction stir processing method. The obtained results 
showed enhanced tensile strength and good ductility in the manufactured composite. Say et 
al. 12 investigated the corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of AZ91 and AZ61 
magnesium matrix composites reinforced with 01, 0.2, and 0.5 wt carbon nanotubes 
(CNTs). It was observed that with the increasing amount of carbon nanotubes, the strength of 
composites increases.
