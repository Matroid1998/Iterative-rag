Description:
Compounds synthesized using a P(V)based platform.

Text:
The recently disclosed P(V)based platform 
for the construction of Plinkages has been applied to the 
simplified synthesis of an ever growing, diverse range of 
compounds such as cyclic dinucleotides,12,13 stereopure 
antisense oligonucleotides,12 methylphosphonates,14 chiral 
phosphines,14 DNA5 and protein bioconjugates,16 complex 
alkaloids,17 and fully chemically modified oligonucleotides 
using a commercial automated synthesizer.18 As part of the 
ongoing platform development, O (1) was identified as 
a suitable reagent for forging phosphodiester bonds.18 This 
Letter builds on those findings to highlight how the 
chemoselective nature of reagents can be leveraged to 
access phosphates from alcohols in a mild, scalable, and 
operationally simple (onepot) fashion across a wide range 
of alcohol substrates. FIGURE 1. Alcohol phosphorylation Literature precedent, 
limitations, and a mild solution using the O reagent (1).
