Description:
An isomer of vinylidene involved in a 1,2-hydrogen shift reaction.

Text:
Vinylidene (H2CC) is a highenergy isomer of acetylene (HCCH), and isomerization between 
the two species represents the simplest example of a 1,2hydrogen shift reaction.1 Vinylidene has 
been the focus of many theoretical211 and experimental1218 studies owing to its very low barrier 
for isomerization to acetylene (0.1 eV),19 which opens the possibility for coupling between 
vibrational states of vinylidene and highly excited acetylene. Because of the low isomerization 
barrier, the vibration of vinylidene can be strongly anharmonic, especially for modes related to the 
isomerization coordinate. In fact, such departures from the harmonic limit encode the 
isomerization dynamics.
