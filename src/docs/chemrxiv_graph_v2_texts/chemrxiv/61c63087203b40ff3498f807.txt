Description:
A compound that is reduced by formate dehydrogenase enzymes.

Metalloenzymes are proteins that catalyze key chemical transformations under mild 
conditions.1,2 Understanding the structure and function of these enzymes can enable design 
strategies for molecular catalysts with high activity and selectivity necessary for industrial use.36 
CO2 reduction remains a challenging chemical reaction that is not industrially viable710 but is 
carried out efficiently and selectively by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzymes.1114 MoW
containing FDHs convert CO2 reversibly to formate (HCOO), a chemical fuel and H2 storage 
compound.1518 Although MoW ions frequently appear in nature for the interconversion of CO2 
and HCOO, only a few examples of MoWbased homogeneous catalysts1923 have been 
proposed for reduction of CO2 in comparison to costly noble metal catalysts2427 or earth 
abundant nontoxic metal catalysts.2830 Therefore, understanding the active site of MoW 
dependent FDH to better isolate the geometric and electronic environment effects is valuable for 
designing novel bioinspired MoWbased molecular catalysts.
