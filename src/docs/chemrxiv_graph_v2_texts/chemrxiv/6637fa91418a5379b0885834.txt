Description:
Forms part of the structure in compound 6, sharing a ring with CBBC units.

We corroborated this 
empirical assumption by conducting density functional theory (DFT) calculations for 6 
and 7. A relatively large bondlength alternation in the sixmembered rings that contain 
the cleaved CC bonds was observed, indicating weak local aromaticity (Fig. S77) (36). We further confirmed that the treatment of substrates 1g, 1h, and 5 under the previously 
reported conditions using sodium dichromate in refluxing acetic acid did not afford the 
corresponding bondcleaved products, which emphasizes the utility of the present 
procedure. An Xray diffraction analysis of single crystals of 6 and 7 revealed their remarkably 
distorted structures with two CBBC subunits (Fig. 2B). Compound 6 adopts an achiral S
shaped structure, in which a racemic pair of CBBC units share one benzene ring.
