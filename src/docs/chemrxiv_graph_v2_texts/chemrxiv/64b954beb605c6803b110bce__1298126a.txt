Description:
Undergoes integer charge transfer with P3HT matrix.

The poor doping efficiency in this system sig
nifies that the charges created via doping are not free. Even at high dopant loading conditions
of 20  maximum conductivity achieved is 10 S cm1.7,8 The Neher group has employed
quantitative analysis of the specific nearinfrared absorption bands of (F4TCNQ) anion to
reveal that nearly every (F4TCNQ) dopant undergoes integer charge transfer with (P3HT)
matrix.9 However, only about 5  fraction of charges dissociate to actually contribute a free
hole for electrical conduction, while the remaining 95  fraction remains strongly bounded. It must be noted that these results were obtained at a very low doping regime, well below the
