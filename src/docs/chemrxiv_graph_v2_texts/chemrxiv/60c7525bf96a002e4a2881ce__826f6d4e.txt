Description:
Catalytic reactions within zeolites are sensitive to effects due to their pore dimensions.

Text:
Catalytic reactions within zeolites are especially 
sensitive to these effects, because the pores that confine active sites possess dimensions similar to the 
solvation shells of surface intermediates (0.5  2 nm).4 Consequently, the topology and polarity of these 
pores induce significant changes in the structure and dynamics of the solvent molecules.59 
Water (H2O) molecules within microporous environments form intricate structures through 
hydrogen bonds (HB) that impact the stability of adsorbates, intrapore diffusion coefficients, and surface 
reactions.
