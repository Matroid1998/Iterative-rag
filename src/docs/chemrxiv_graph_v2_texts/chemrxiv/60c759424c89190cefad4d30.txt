Description:
An important aromatic compound involved in the atmospheric chemistry of Titan.

Text:
Toluene has been suggested as an important aromatic compound in the 
atmosphere of Titan.13 The reaction of toluene with cyano radical (CN) is 
a crucial channel to incorporate nitrogen into Titans molecular weight 
growth model,4 which ultimately leads to the brown appearance of Titans 
atmosphere.57 Previous studies have shown very fast rate coefficients 
between CN and unsaturated compounds including aromatics at low 
temperatures.8, 9 Recently, Messinger et al.10 investigated this reaction by 
the pulsed laser photolysislaserinduced fluorescence (PLPLIF) technique 
and quantum chemical calculations, indicating that the rate constants of CN 
 toluene between 15 and 294 K are independent of temperature, with an 
average value of (4.1  0.2)  1010 cm3 molecule1 s1, at the total gas 
density from 2.7 to 10.5  1016 cm3.

A compound whose reaction products with CN were detected using tunable synchrotron VUV photoionization mass spectrometry.

Text:
Trevitt et al.11 have measured the rate 
coefficients of toluene  CN to be 1.31010 cm3 molecule1 s1 using a 
pulsed Laval nozzle expansion in conjunction with laserinduced 
fluorescence (LIF) at 105 K and 4 Torr. In addition, the reaction products 
of CN with toluene were detected by using tunable synchrotron VUV 
photoionization mass spectrometry. The experimental results also revealed
