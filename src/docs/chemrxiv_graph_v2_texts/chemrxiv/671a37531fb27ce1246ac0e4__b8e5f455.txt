Description:
An element that forms part of the covalent XMX sandwich structure in TMD monolayers.

2D materials have become increasingly relevant in a wide
variety of research areas, ever since the initial exfoliation
of graphene in 2004 1. Since graphenes discovery,
many classes of 2D materials have been discovered,
such as hexagonalboron nitride, MXenes and transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs); each with their own
unique and distinct properties, and applications 26. TMDs are a class of layered materials in which,
similarly to graphite, there are covalently bonded mono
layers with van der Waals interactions between layers
to form layered bulk structures. Unlike graphite, where
all atoms are in a single plane, TMD monolayers consist
of a covalent XMX sandwich structure, with X and
M being the chalcogen and metal species respectively
