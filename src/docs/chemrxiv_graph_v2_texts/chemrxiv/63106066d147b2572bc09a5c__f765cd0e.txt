Used in aqueous solutions to study microheterogeneity.

Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides impeccable insight
into local solvation structure in the vicinity of the chromophore.1
SoftXAS has been used as a direct probe of microheterogeneity in
aqueous acetonitrile solutions2 and has revealed the contrasting
nature between weak ammoniawater and strong ammonium
water hydrogen bonds.3,4 Xray absorption nestructure (XAFS)
spectroscopy was also recently applied to study the hydration
structure about ions of all of the rst row transition metal ele
ments.5 As the application of XASrelated methods becomes more
ubiquitous, it is increasingly important that theoretical methods
meet the challenge of modeling XAS in liquid phase to aid in spec
tral assignments and to shed light on the atomistic structural de
tails that lead to key spectroscopic signatures.
