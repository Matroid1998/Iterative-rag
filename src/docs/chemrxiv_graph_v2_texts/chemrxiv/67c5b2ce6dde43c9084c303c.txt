Description:
A pentagonal anion-binding macrocycle first reported in 2013 with high-fidelity recognition of anions.

Text:
Cyanostar (CS, Figure 1) is a pentagonal anionbinding macrocycle first reported in 
2013.1 It is one of a class of planar and shapepersistent macrocycles that have fivefold 
symmetry,25 and a subset of C5symmetric macrocycles with different shapes like the tubular 
pillar5arenes.6,7 Since its debut, cyanostar has provided both reliable and novel anion binding 
properties, relying on highfidelity recognition of anions (X) as 21 complexes1,817 and as 
higher order systems, e.g.

Description:
Used as a dopant for polymer semiconductors and as a structure-directing element in fluorescent materials called small-molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES).

has been used as a dopant for polymer semiconductors,23 and as the key structuredirecting 
element in fluorescent materials called smallmolecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES).3039 
Cyanostar was the first anion receptor to engage cyanostilbenes for the purpose of stabilizing 
anions with CH hydrogen bonds and others have now followed suit.40,41 The five cyanostilbene 
units in the cyanostar macrocycle are a result of Knoevenagel condensations that occur in a high
yielding onepot cyclooligomerization using the appropriate cyanoaldehyde monomer.

Description:
A macrocyclic compound produced through optimized synthetic steps.

Text:
The 
synthetic steps to produce this monomer, as well as the macrocyclization step, have been optimized 
for reliable cyanostar production. The simplicity of synthesis, such as in the preparation of pillar5arenes,6,42 opens doors 
to the exploration of a receptors chemistry. The short synthesis of pillar5arenes often involves 
an initial step to make the functionalized building block followed by its macrocyclization. Typical
