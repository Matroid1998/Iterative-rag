HfC, ZrB2) as 
thermal protection materials, where the temperatures of interest may be well above 3000 K, in a 
range where conventional surface chemistry or furnace methods for surface kinetics are difficult 
or impossible. The upper temperature limit of the single NP mass spectrometry method8 is, in 
principle, determined only by the material, i.e., by the requirement that the NP must not
