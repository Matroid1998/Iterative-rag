Description:
Used industrially for capturing CO2 but limited by chemical instability and corrosiveness.

The separation and purification of chemicals are highly important processes in the
chemical industry and account for 45  55  of their energy consumption 1, 2. The
capture of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, from dilute sources (e.g. flue gas which
generally contains 4  30  CO2 in a mixture with N2) 3 has generally been achieved at
an industrial scale using alkanoamines such as monoethanolamine (MEA) 4. However,
the chemical instability, their corrosiveness, and the cost of many alkanoamines limit
their widespread application. An estimated 60  80 of the total cost of the carbon
capture and sequestration (CCS) process is estimated to originate from procedures
pertaining to the utilization of the amine solutions 5.
