Description:
A compound with various ring substitutions explored for copolymerization with styrene.

Text:
Synthesis and styrene copolymerization was reported for 2,3,4
trimethoxyphenyl isobutyl PCA 12. 2,4,5Trimethoxy functionalized styrene was 
reported as bioactive component of the bark of Duguetia panamensis 13. It also was 
mentioned in study of pachypophyllin and pachypostaudins A and B  three 
bisnorlignans from Pachypodanthium staudtii 14 and in study of antiinflammatory 
and antinociceptive activities of a phenylpropanoidenriched fraction of Duguetia 
furfuracea 15. 3 

In this work we have prepared novel ringsubstituted tertbutyl phenylcyanoacrylates, 
RPhCHC(CN)CO2C(CH3)3, where R is 4phenoxy, 3iodo, 2,4dimethoxy, 3,4
dimethoxy, 4ethoxy3methoxy, 4fluoro3methoxy, 4hydoxy3,5dimethyl, 2,3,4
trimethoxy, 2,4,5trimethoxy, and explored the feasibility of their copolymerization with 
styrene. To the best of our knowledge there have been no reports on either synthesis of 
these compounds, nor their copolymerization with styrene 16.
