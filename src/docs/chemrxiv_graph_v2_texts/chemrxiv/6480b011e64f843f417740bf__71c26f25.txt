Description:
Molecules known for their highly reversible redox activity and stoichiometric capture of CO2 upon reduction.

Text:
A range of electrochemical carbon dioxide capture 
systems have been reported, including those based on electrochemically driven pH swings,8 
capacitive systems,9,10 and systems that employ redoxactive molecules such as quinones, 
both in protic and aprotic electrolytes.1115 Using redoxactive quinone molecules is one of the 
largest areas of research for new technologies due to their highly reversible redoxactivity and 
stoichiometric capture of CO2 upon reduction.
