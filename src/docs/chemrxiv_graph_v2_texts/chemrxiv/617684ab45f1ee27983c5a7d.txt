Description:
Stored in the protein ferritin as part of a molecular ferrihydrite cluster.

Text:
The plausibility of this concept is further supported by the existence of the iron storage protein ferritin 
which holds 4,500 FeIII ions in a molecular ferrihydrite cluster in the inner wall of its spherical shell.17 
The synthetic procedures used to make Fe13,, Fe17, and Fe34 are remarkably straightforward. For 
example, Fe17 is made by dissolving anhydrous FeBr3 in wet pyridine (py) (or from a combination of 
pyridine with a second cosolvent).15 Fe34 comes from an analogous reaction to Fe17 but with a 
different solvent ratio and in the presence of an additional basetemplating agent.16 The wet pyridine 
acts as a solvent, a source of H2O (O2, OH), base, ligand, and cation (pyH). Charge balancing anions 
originate from the salt employed.
