Description:
A class of cationic group 4 complexes studied for their TMFLP properties.

Text:
Selected examples include the archetypal reversible H2 activation,10 the 
binding of CO2 and CO11 and the ringopening of epoxides.12 
The FLP paradigm can be extended to transition metals (TM
FLPs), where either of the Lewis pair partners, or both, can be TM
based.1315 An extensively studied class of TMFLPs is the family of 
cationic 
group 
4 
metallocene 
phosphinoaryloxide 
complexes 
developed by the group of Wass.16 Similar to main group FLPs, the 
formation of the Lewis adduct between the group 4 metal centre and 
the pendant phosphine in these complexes is hampered.
