Description:
The chemically intuitive Clars sextet rule states that more aromatic sextets result in a larger optical gap and higher stability.

For example, 
triangular GQDs of varying size exhibit a progressive redshift of their ultranarrow absorption 
and emission bands with increasing size.3 Nanographene sizeshape can also be utilized to tune 
their optical properties (and chemical stability) and is best described by the chemically intuitive 
Clars sextet rule of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which states that the more aromatic 
sextets (that is, the more benzenelike subunits) in the molecule, the larger the optical gap and 
higher the stability.4 Computational results confirm the sextet rule when comparing armchair 
and zigzagedged nanographenes.
