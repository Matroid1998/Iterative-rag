Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries as part of electrochemical devices.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a class of liquid mixtures
with a melting point considerably lower than that of their in
dividual components, and commonly even lower than the pre
dicted ideal eutectic point13. DESs share many of the desir
able properties of ionic liquids (ILs), such as low vapor pressure,
thermal and chemical stability, and tunable properties4,5. More
over, they possess several advantages over conventional ILs, in
cluding facile synthesis, lower production costs, generally lower
toxicity, and higher ionic conductivities, which make them a
promising class of materials for electrochemical applications68. Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) refer to those DESs appli
cable as electrolytes in electrochemical devices such as redox
flow batteries911 and lithiumion batteries (LIBs)1214.
