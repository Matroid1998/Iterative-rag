Principal adsorbents of phosphates in soils.

Notably, Fe and Al(oxyhydr)oxides play a pivotal role as the principal adsorbents of 
phosphates in soils (Borggaard, 2001; Borggaard et al., 2004; Elzinga and Sparks, 2007; Zhong et 
al., 2007). The high affinity of phosphates for these oxides stems from their ability to form stable 
covalent bonds with the surfaces of these oxides, termed innersphere surface complexes (Ahmed 
et al., 2019; Dimirkou et al., 2002; Kruse et al., 2015; Y. T. Wang et al., 2016). Among these 
oxyhydroxides, goethite (FeOOH) stands out as the most prevalent pedogenic reactive ferric iron 
Fe(III) mineral and plays a critical role for P fixation in soils (Arai and Sparks, 2007; Chitrakar et al., 
2006; Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003; Tsao et al., 2011).
