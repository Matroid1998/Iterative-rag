Description:
Generally used as active material for fabricating water-induced electricity generators.

demonstrated 
a series of MIEGs that is composed of a pair of electrodes and hygroscopic materials with a 
chemicalgradient structure.22, 30, 31 The other type is waterinduced electricity generators (WIEGs) 
based on concentrationtemperature gradient of salty liquid water3235 or the interactions between 
liquid water and electrically conductive solids.36 Carbon materials such as carbon black 
nanoparticles (CBNPs),37, 38 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),3941 and graphene42 are generally used as the 
active materials for fabricating WIEGs. For example, Xue et al. developed a CBNPbased WIEG 
that can generate a voltage up to 1 V,38 which was claimed to arise from water evaporation.
