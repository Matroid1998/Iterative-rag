Description:
Involved in electrochemical reduction reactions.

Text:
High entropy alloy particles are often made by melting mixtures of metals or metal salt precursors
at high temperatures ( 1000C).1114 It is generally assumed that at such high temperatures the different
elements are randomly distributed at the lattice sites in both bulk and at surfaces and that quenching the
temperature can keep the elements in place.13 However, it is possible that some local order still exist at
high temperatures, especially at surfaces, and that heating therefore will not produce randomized
surfaces. The AgAuCuPdPt high entropy alloy is catalytically active for the electrochemical CO2 and CO
reduction reactions.15,16 We therefore choose equimolar fcc AgAuCuPdPt and study the local order in
the bulk and at the (111), (100) and (533) surfaces.
