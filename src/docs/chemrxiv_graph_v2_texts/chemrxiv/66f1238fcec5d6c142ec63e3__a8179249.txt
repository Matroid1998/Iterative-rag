Description:
Positioning within the zeolite framework significantly influences catalytic behavior.

Text:
Zeolite ZSM5 stands out as one
of the most extensively used zeolites in the petrochemical industry,
where it can serve as an efficient catalyst for hydrocarbon trans
formations.1,2 The catalytic activity of zeolites is primarily gov
erned by their chemical composition, with structural features such
as channel shape, accessible pore volume, and the positioning of
aluminium atoms within the framework significantly influencing
their catalytic behaviour.24
Accurately determining the position of aluminium atoms within
the zeolite framework is useful for understanding and optimizing
catalytic properties.2,4 However, traditional techniques like Xray
crystallography have inadequate sensitivity for distinguishing be
tween aluminium and silicon atoms and thus it cannot be used for
the determination of the aluminium siting.

magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, particularly 27Al NMR,
has emerged as a powerful tool for probing the local environments
of aluminium atoms in zeolites.57 Several studies have attempted
to correlate experimental 27Al NMR spectra with specific Tsites in
the zeolite framework.813 However, sizable inconsistencies in the
calculated chemical shifts reported in these studies illustrate the
continuing challenges faced by researchers in this field. Interpreting solidstate NMR spectra can be challenging due to
signal broadening and overlap.
