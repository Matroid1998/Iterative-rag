Description:
Used in the form of single-walled carbon nanotubes for bioimaging applications.

The biocompatible nature of this class 
of layered silicates has been demonstrated by cell viability 
assays and in vivo studies31. Among them, an increasing number 
of publications has proven the high potential of EBNS in the 
biomedical field as multifunctional platform for bioimaging31,32, 
sensing33, 
photothermal 
therapy 
(PTT)34,35, 
tissue 
engineering36,37 and more. Especially as novel NIR fluorophore, 
EBNS appears of extreme interest. Fluorophores that emit in 
the NIR window (NIRI   7501000 nm; NIRII   1000
1700 nm) present optimal characteristics for bioimaging due to 
reduced 
phototoxicity, 
scattering, 
absorption 
and 
autofluorescence of biological samples at these wavelengths38
41. Although organic dyes (e.g. indocyanine green42, modified 
boron dipyrromethenes4346, etc.) and nanomaterials (e.g. quantum dots47, silicon nanocrystals48, singlewalled carbon 
nanotubes4955, etc.)
