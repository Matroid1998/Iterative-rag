Description:
Forms single atoms in Pt-containing catalysts, creating a favorable interfacial water structure.

Comparing to the carbon blacksupported counterparts, the 
PGMpNC catalysts exhibited much higher HOR activity. Microscopic, spectroscopic, and 
electrochemical investigations revealed the multiple roles of the the pNC support. In particular, 
this support leads to the formation of Pt single atoms (SAs) for Ptcontaining catalysts. These Pt 
SAs creates a favorable interfacial water structure. The optimized catalyst, PtRupNC, has the 
highest reported intrinsic activity and mass activity in alkaline condition. An HEMFC with a low 
loading of this PtRupNC HOR catalyst (0.16 mgPGMcm2) and a commercial FeNC ORR 
catalyst achieves a peak power density of 1.46 Wcm2.
