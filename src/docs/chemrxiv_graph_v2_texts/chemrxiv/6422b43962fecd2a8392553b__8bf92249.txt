Description:
Not thermodynamically stable due to weak coordination bonds.

Text:
The reason why the Pd61412 SP is not 
thermodynamically stable is mainly due to weak coordination bonds 
made between the two Pd2124 open structures (indicated as red 
broken circles in Fig. 1). Increasing the concentration of the substrates 
without competitive leaving ligand (Py) shifts the equilibrium towards 
the Pd61412 SP but uncharacterized species remain even at almost 
saturation concentration (Figs. 1, left and S1).73 Thus, the Pd61412 
SP cannot be produced as a sole product under thermodynamic 
control. Here we present almost quantitative assembly of the Pd61412 SP 
by pathwaydependent process under kinetic control promoted by 
synergy of the template anion (BF4) and the assist anion (ReO4) 
even at low concentration.
