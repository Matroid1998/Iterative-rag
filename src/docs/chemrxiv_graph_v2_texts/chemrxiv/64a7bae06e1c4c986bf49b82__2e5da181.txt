Description:
A greenhouse gas released from industries and automobile engines.

Text:
The environment is getting polluted due to the release of greenhouse gases from various 
sources, including industries and automobile engines1. Heavy vehicles that consume fossil fuels 
are one of the significant sources of the emission of toxic gases like CO, CO2, SO2, and NO. In 
this context, greener fuels that can stave off climate change include biofuels, biogas, and 
hydrogen produced from water splitting2. Incessant efforts have been made to the watersplitting field during the past few years3 as it is 
a prospective solution for energy and environmentrelated problems2 and their largescale 
practical applications in the near future. Electrocatalytic water splitting is a viable and scalable 
energy technology for the utilisation of renewable energies.
