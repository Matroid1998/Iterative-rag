Description:
Exhibits a plateau of catalytic activity against the oxygen amount.

Text:
of oxygen improved hydrogen poisoning and enhanced activity. It is evidenced by the larger reaction order of 
hydrogen as the oxygen content increased in RuCaH22xOx. However, excessive oxygen caused the lower 
electron donation and decreased the activity found in RuCaH1.12O0.44, indicated by the high appEa. It matches 
that the N2 order is high, and N2 dissociation is more difficult when the oxygen content is x  0.44. Therefore, 
RuCaH22xOx had the plateau of catalytic activity against the oxygen amount. 0
