Description:
The thermal stability can be improved through the doping of metal ions.

Text:
of new energy levels in the forbidden band through the doping of metal ions 
is an effective strategy to improve the thermal stability of TiO2. In the present study, the impact 
of Ta doping on the anatase to rutile transition (ART), structural characteristics, anion and 
cation vacancy formation were investigated in detail using Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
and experimental characterisation including, Xray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and Xray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The average crystallite size of TiO2 decreases with an 
increase in the Ta concentration. At high temperatures, more oxygen atoms entered the crystal 
lattice and occupy the vacancies, leading to lattice expansion.
