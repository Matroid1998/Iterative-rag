Description:
An environmentally and economically sustainable alternative to Co for cathode manufacturing.

Text:
In 2011, the European Commission (EC) made a list of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs), resources 
mainly used in energy transition and digital technologies which were defined by Overland as raw 
materials for which there are no viable substitutes with current technologies, which most consumer 
countries are dependent on importing, and whose supply is dominated by one or a few producers.3 
The original list has been updated every three years since it was first drawn up, until, in March 2023, 
EC proposed the Critical Raw Material Act which sets benchmarks for the extraction, the processing 
and the recycling of CRMs in Europe at 10, 40 and 15 of EUs annual consumption, 
respectively.4 Along with the Act, the list of CRMs was updated extending the total number to 37, 
including also Al and Cu (widespread in LIBs industry as current collector materials), and Mn and 
Ni (two more environmentally and economically sustainable alternatives to Co for cathode 
manufacturing).5 
Another relevant issue addressed in the Act concerns the diversification of supplies.

Description:
A critical raw material used in battery production.

Text:
Ukraine plays a crucial 
role in the global supply chain of CRMs used in battery production, including Ni, Mn, and graphite; 
it also has large Li reserves, although these are currently untapped and probably will be unavailable 
for some time due to the RussianUkrainian conflict.6 
However, LIBs are complex devices and do not only contain metals and graphite, but also valuable 
fluorinated materials. For example, fluorinated lithium salts organic solutions (e.g. 1.0M LiPF6 in 
ECDMC) are used as electrolytes; poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is the benchmark binder for the 
stateoftheart cathodes, due to its outstanding properties, such as safety, chemical stability, good 
adhesion to the current collectors and excellent freestanding performances.713
