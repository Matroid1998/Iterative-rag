Description:
Used in the form of carbon nanotubes in electrochemical techniques, raising concerns about capital cost.

Among solid sorbents for TSA and 
PSA, physisorbents are not very selective, and prone to preferred water adsorption.8 Chemisorbing, 
grafted amines have similar selectivity as liquid amines, but tend to degrade relatively easily, and 
the desorption step is energyintensive.9,10 Electrochemical techniques have recently emerged as 
alternatives to pressure and temperatureswing processes.1113 However, many of them use quite 
complicated cell architectures that are difficult to scale.14 Frequently, expensive materials such as 
bipolar membranes, ionexchange membranes, carbon nanotubes, ionic liquid electrolytes, and 
specialty polymers are used raising concerns about capital cost.13,15,16 Some electrochemical 
techniques, e.g. EMAR, also employ amines which have the abovementioned limitations.1719 
Most electrochemical capture techniques involve redoxprocesses which tend to have limited cycle 
life, and slow kinetics.20,21 Some, for example sea water electrolysis, produce toxic and corrosive
