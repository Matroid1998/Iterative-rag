Description:
Used as complexing agents for solvent extraction separation procedures.

Text:
Due to their widespread application and advantageous reactions, thiocarbohydrazide (1) and its 
derivatives are of great interest for study. In addition to their therapeutic significance, they have 
a great deal of value in a variety of beneficial applications, including the assessment process of 
threedimensional ultrastructure examination techniques of interphase nuclei and tissues. They 
are also referred to as foggy agents and are thought of as chemical warfare agents that are secure, 
storable, and coolburning pyrotechnic substances for smoke distribution. Thiocarbohydrazides, 
on the other hand, are used as complexing agents for solvent extraction separation procedures as 
well as highly efficient heavy metal ion adsorbents 1. Given these details and building upon my
