Description:
Produced by oxidation of orthomethoxybenzyl alcohol over TiO2 photocatalysts.

This approach, however, does not take into 
account the photochemical behaviour of products of partial oxidation of aromatic alcohols that 
are produced during irradiation of the suspension of photocatalysts in the substrate solution. In 
2016, 
the 
Augugliaro 
group 
reported 
the 
photocatalytic 
effect 
of 
ortho
methoxybenzaldehyde, produced by oxidation of orthomethoxybenzyl alcohol over TiO2 
photocatalysts, on homogeneous photooxidation of other alcohols under UV light.19 
Surprisingly, this important finding that should have alarmed many researchers has been sadly 
neglected by the community, as this paper has received only few citations so far. Two years 
later, Pavan et al. addressed the question of benzyl alcohol selfoxidation under UVlight.20 
When irradiating benzyl alcohol solution in acetonitrile with UVA light, they observed that after 
a long induction time benzaldehyde was formed.
