Description:
Mediates charge transfer to CO2 during reduction reactions.

Text:
Here, we follow the evolution of the electronic structure in MoS2 electrocatalysts during CO2RR 
using operando Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We probed both the ligand and metal 
centers under functional CO2RR conditions and simulated the corresponding spectroscopic 
signatures using firstprinciples calculations. Thus, we report direct spectroscopic evidence of 
CO2 binding to Mo at sulfur vacancies, which perturbs the hybridization between S 3p and Mo 4d 
states. The spectroscopic signatures of the active state are consistent with the reduction of Mo, 
revealing its role in mediating charge transfer to CO2.
