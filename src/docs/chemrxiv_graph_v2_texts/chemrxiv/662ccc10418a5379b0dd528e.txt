Description:
A chemical energy carrier produced from solar energy and water.

Text:
The conversion of solar energy and water into chemical energy via the production of hydrogen is a 
topic that has attracted substantial interest for years. Many different technologies have been 
investigated so far to produce hydrogen from sunlight and water. To reach maturity, such technologies 
should be at the same time i) efficient (in terms of solartohydrogen (STH) efficiency), ii) stable 
under intermittent operation and over years of operation, and iii) scalable, which means that they 
should rely on Earthabundant materials and cost and energyeffective processes. (1) The main 
challenge is to achieve high STH efficiency with low cost materials (light absorbers, catalysts, 
membranes) and to overcome barriers that limit the scalability and the stability of such new 
technologies.

Description:
A renewable fuel that can be produced without drawing electricity from the grid.

However, there is a consensus that the demand for electricity will increase in the coming years. All 
scenarii promote electrification, whenever possible, to decarbonize our economy. (7) Therefore, 
competition for electricity availability and greater constraints on the grid stability are expected to 
emerge. With this perspective, producing renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, without drawing 
electricity from the grid, seems particularly relevant. (8) In order to advance the deployment of these 
systems, and subsequently refine the cost analysis, it is important to carry out practical 
demonstrations, whether they involve scalability validations or preliminary tests in real environment. This will provide a clearer knowledge of the concrete issues that need to be overcome.
