Description:
Generated via bauxite ore processing using the Bayer process.

In 2015, higher than 57 million tons essential Al was produced, whereas the
global Al2O3 production was larger than 115 million tons. Indeed, the principal raw material sources for alumina
generation are bauxite and nepheline ores. Other sources such Al2O3 extraction from Kaolin and high Al2O3
containing clays have been featured. So, for that, according to the Jesef Bayer process, Alumina is generated via
Bauxite Ore processing, where bauxite ore is digested with lime addition by sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH). The following fig.1, gives a brief description of this natural resource processing to yield the wellknown material
(Al2O3) which can subsequently might be considered for a wide range of applications, including catalysis,
medical technologies, environment uses, and Aluminum (Al) and its alloys engineering. Fig.1.

Alumina (Al2O3) producing from Bauxite through the wellknown Jesef Bayer process
So, under this process, a byproduct is generation (red mud) which is viewed as waste under the Al2O3 production
and might be a challenge for this process. However, as thoughts in Sushils research 26, red mud could be as
catalyst and it might be good alternative to the present commercial catalysts. So that due its properties such as
iron content in form of ferric oxide (Fe2O3), sintering resistance, goodly surface area, resistance to poisoning,
and as well as its cheapest price make it an attractive prospect catalyst for many reactions and beyond. Therefore,
in this paper, it is revised from bauxite to (Al2O3Al) as an alternative strategical advanced materials for high
tech uses
