Description:
Emerging benzene bioisosteres used in drug development.

Text:
Bridged ring systems represent longstanding targets for organic chemists because they are 
versatile skeletons of natural products and pharmaceuticals.14 Among them, saturated 
bicyclon.1.1alkanes have emerged as attractive synthetic targets because they are becoming ever 
more important in the design and development of new pharmaceuticals.510 For example, 
bicyclo1.1.1pentanes,11 bicyclo2.1.1hexanes12 and bicyclo3.1.1heptanes13,14 are emerging 
benzene bioisosteres (Scheme 1A). Replacing planar benzene rings with such threedimensional 
bicyclic molecules could potentially ameliorate physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, 
thereby increasing the odds of drug development success. In addition, bicyclon.1.1alkanes are 
widely present in natural products1518 or as key intermediates to complex molecules19 (Scheme 
1B).

Description:
Halogenated compounds produced via cycloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes with dihalocarbenes.

Therefore, the development of novel strategies for the synthesis of bicyclon.1.1alkanes 
would not only enrich the toolkit of synthetic chemists but also greatly enlarge the compound 
library accessible for drug discovery. Cycloaddition reactions are among the most important tools in organic chemistry. In particular, 
the formal (n3) cycloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs)2028 has recently become a 
particularly valuable strategy for the rapid construction of saturated bicyclon.1.1alkanes 
(Scheme 1C). The formal (31) cycloaddition of BCBs with dihalocarbenes was first reported by 
Applequist in 197729 and further developed by Mykhailiuk,30 Ma31 and Anderson,32 respectively, 
providing a route to various halogenated bicyclo1.1.1pentanes.
