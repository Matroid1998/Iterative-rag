Description:
Characterized by a soft lattice and large anharmonicity due to high multiphonon scattering probabilities.

Text:
teractions in the structural stabilization4, carrier thermalization5,
carrier recombination6,7, carrier transport8,9 and dephasing dy
namics10,11 are widely reported. The acoustic modes, on the
other hand, determine the thermal properties of the material, in
cluding thermal conductivity, molar specic heat, and thermal ex
pansion of the lattice. At rst glance, these appear to be clear
manifestations of the anharmonicity of the lattice, models for
which are available in any basic textbook for solidstate physics
such as Ref. 12. The distinction of metalhalide perovskites from
classical semiconductors lies, however, in the softness of the lat
tice and rather large anharmonicity induced by substantially high
multiphonon scattering probabilities1,13.
