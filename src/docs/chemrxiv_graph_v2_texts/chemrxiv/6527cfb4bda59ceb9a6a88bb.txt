Methane is a greenhouse gas and plays a key role in
atmospheric chemistry, the formation of air pollution
and the atmospheres oxidation capacity 1. Between
1750 and 2022, the atmospheric methane concentration
has risen from 72910 ppb to 1910 ppb 2, 3. Methane
alone has increased anthropogenic radiative forcing by
1.190.39 Wm2, which is responsible for a 0.6 0.3
1.0 C increase in global mean surface air temperature
4. A significant amount of anthropogenic methane
emissions, 40, are from the agricultural sector 4,
where animal production in particular makes a large
contribution 5. Methane sinks include methanotrophs
in the soil (10) and gas phase radical reactions,
mainly with the OH radical per reaction 1. CH4  OH
