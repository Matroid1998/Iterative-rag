Description:
Used for base metal extraction in leach solutions.

Text:
Since the success of the leaching stage depends on the choice of the leach solution and leach 
conditions, investigations to develop new leach solutions and optimization of leach parameters 
is being undertaken. Leach solutions employed for Cu recovery include acids, bases, salts, and 
ionic liquids. Typical acids used for base metal extraction are sulfuric acid 10, nitric acid 11, 
hydrochloric acid 12, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 11, and mixtures of acids 13. These 
acids have often been used in combination with oxidants such as oxygen, H2O2, ferric salts, and 
chlorine gas 14, 15.
