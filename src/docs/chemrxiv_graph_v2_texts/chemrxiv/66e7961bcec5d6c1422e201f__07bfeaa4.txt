Description:
Graphene oxide based membranes obtain carbon-oxygen interfaces with water.

In 
41 
contrast, functionalised carbon in humid or aqueous environments are ubiquitous and thus 
42 
relevant in many systems. For example, the hydrophilic groups in lipid bilayers or DNA 
43 
strands11,12 as well as in hydrophilic polymer membranes13,14, graphene oxide (GO)based 
44 
membranes1519 or single atom catalysts20,21 all obtain carbonoxygen interfaces with water. 45 
All these examples exist in aqueous environments that contain cations. However, there is lack 
46 
of studies looking at the carbonoxygen interface with water in the presence of cations 
47 
despite its enormous fundamental and technological relevance. Hence, conceiving an AWC 
48 
study that can investigate the interfacial hydrogen network in functionalised carbon under 
49 
the presence of cations is highly desirable.

Description:
Can be readily intercalated with cations, allowing probing of the interfacial hydrogen network.

Here, we solve this issue by utilising functionalised 
50 
graphene (graphene oxide) as a representative of functionalised carbon. Graphene oxide (GO) 
51 
can be readily intercalated with cations which allows probing the interfacial hydrogen 
52 
network of functionalised carbon under the presence of cations via AWC. 53 
Graphene oxide is composed of a graphene plane along with various oxygen functionalities22
54 
26. The presence of functionalised areas gives rise to stable dipole sites and development of a 
55 
hydrogen bond network with water molecules15,16. Water transport via GO based materials 
56 
has been widely studied in experiments and simulations to better understand its surface 
57 
interaction with water molecules2734. Yet, direct experimental evidence is still limited for 
58 
progressive understanding of the hydrogenbond network on the GO surface.
