Description:
A cyclopentenone derivative containing a five-member ketone fused with two benzene rings.

This reliance made it to 
award the Nobel Prize in 2010 in chemistry on transition metal catalysed crosscoupling 
reactions.2 The palladium sometimes prove to be superior to the others owing to 1) 
compatible with different functional groups 2) it can functionalize all three types sp3, sp2 and 
sp carbon atoms 3) most of the palladium catalyst can tolerate air and moisture, and produces 
desired compounds in reasonably milder reaction conditions.3 Furthermore, palladium shows 
low toxicity and easy to separate from the reaction mixture after the reaction is complete. Fluorenone (2.1) is a cyclopentenone derivatives containing a fivemember ketone fused with 
two benzene rings. When one of the fused benzene ring is substituted by pyridine ring 
compound referred to as azafluorenone (2.2) (Fig. 2.1). Fig.

2.1 Fluorenone and azafluorenone 
The Azafluorenones constitute a growing class of alkaloids. The representative alkaloids of 
this kind having potential bioactivity include the compounds 2.32.5 as shown in Fig. 2.2.4 
Onychine (2.3) showed activity against C. albicans B311 and also exhibited antimicrobial 
activity against S. aureus NCTC8530, B subtitles IFO 3007, Escherichia coli IFO 3545 and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0203.5, 6 Polyfothine (2.4) shows DNAdamaging activity.7 

Isoursuline (2.5) showed antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum at micromolar 
concentrations.8 Considering the importance of azafluorenones, a general and convenient 
synthetic methodology still is ongoing research. Several such compounds and their 
derivatives are important for biomedical applications931.
