Description:
A possible anion X in the Pd(PtBu3)2X complex.

The transient nature of these 
mononuclear Pd(I) intermediates, however, prevents isola
tion and detailed characterization. So far, isolable mononuclear Pd(I) complexes are exceed
ingly rare. Figure 1 lists the known examples. The PtBu3
supported twocoordinate Pd(I) complexes Pd(PtBu3)2X 
(I, X  CB11H12, PF6)32,33 reported independently by Chaplins 
and Ozerovs groups in 2016 were prepared by singleelec
tron oxidation of the Pd(0) complex Pd(PtBu3)2 with fer
rocenium or triphenylmethyl cation. In similar way, the two
coordinate Pd(I) complexes with PAd3 and Nheterocyclic 
carbene as supporting ligands Pd(PAd3)2BArF4 (II, ArF  
3,5(CF3)2C6H3)34 and Pd(IPr)2PF6 (III, IPr  1,3bis(2,6
diisopropylphenyl)imidazole2ylidene)35 were prepared 
by oxidizing the corresponding Pd(0) precursors. The reac
tivity of the homoleptic Pd(I) complexes IIII remains poorly 
understood.
