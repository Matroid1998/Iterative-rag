Description:
A material with broad optical absorption and low carrier recombination suitable for photocatalytic systems.

Text:
Particularly, the Janus chromium
dichalcogenide monolayer (CrSSe) has broad optical absorp
tion and low carrier recombination suitable for the photocat
alytic system28. In addition, it shows better performance
in photocatalytic reactions, water molecule absorptions, uti
lization of sunlight, charge separation and transport, and sur
face chemical reactions29. Similarly, 1Tphase of CrSSe
JTMD possesses intrinsic 2D ferromagnetic behavior with
