Bond cleavage reactions play a fundamental role in or
ganic synthesis, enabling the generation of reactive inter
mediates crucial for subsequent synthetic steps. Selective 
bond cleavage is essential for the efficient production of tar
get molecules while minimizing undesired side reactions. As a result, there is growing demand for novel methodolo
gies that enable the chemoselective cleavage of inert bonds 
in the presence of more reactive functional groups. Among these, the Csp3F bond stands as one of the strong
est single bonds in organic molecules.1,2 While various 
defluorination methods have been developedincluding 
basemediated, transition metalcatalyzed and Lewis acid 
catalyzed approaches314recent advances in photoredox 
chemistry have brought significant progress to this field.
