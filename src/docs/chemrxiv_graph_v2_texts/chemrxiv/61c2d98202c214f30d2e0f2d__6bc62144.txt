Description:
Effort to replace the three-coordinate boron of BN unit with four-coordinate boron has been made.

In addition, the majority of previous attention has been paid 
to the tricoordinate boron units in PAHs,10 tetracoordinate 
boron has been viewed more as a functional group instead of a 
dopant.11 In fact, the coordination number of boron atom 
shows noteworthy impact on the photophysical properties. Until recently, effort to replace the threecoordinate boron of 
BN unit with fourcoordinate boron has been made (Scheme 1a). The formationdissociation of fourcoordinate boron unit 
through a dynamic BN coordination bond in BPAHs (A)12 has 
been exploited for the solutionprocessed fabrication of 
semiconducting films of poorly soluble BPAHs. Hatakeyama et 
al reported that tetracoordinate boronfused helicenes (B)13 as
