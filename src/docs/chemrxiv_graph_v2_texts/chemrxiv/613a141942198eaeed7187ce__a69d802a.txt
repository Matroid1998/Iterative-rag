Description:
A two-dimensional material fabricated as nanoribbons using micromechanical exfoliation.

Text:
The study of pentagonal 2D structures, similar to the Cairo
pentagonal tiles, began when pentagraphene (PG), a ve
membered rings of carbon atoms, was theoretically charac
terized 11. The novel mechanical and electronic proper
ties, and broad applications of pentagraphene inspired to
explore more isostructures. Since then, tremendous efforts
have been made to study the corresponding families of 2D
materials both theoretically and experimentally. For exam
ple, pentasilicene nanoribbons 6, 12, 13, penta PdSe2
14, 15 are successfully fabricated by micromechanical
exfoliation technique 5. In addition, pentagermanium 7,
pentaarsenic carbide 8, pentaCN2 10, pentaB2C 9

have been studied theoretically to investigate different phys
ical and chemical properties.
