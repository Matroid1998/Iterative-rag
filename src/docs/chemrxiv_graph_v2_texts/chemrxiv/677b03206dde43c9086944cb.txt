Description:
A substrate for protein arginine methyl transferases involved in methylation reactions.

Text:
Protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMTs) transfer a me
thyl group from their cosubstrate Sadenosylmethionine 
(SAM) to peptide substrates. Cosubstrate and peptidesub
strate bind at distinct sites that are connected through a central 
channel where the methyl transfer takes place.
