Description:
Structurally similar compounds known to be effective against different types of cancer with varying levels of toxicity.

Text:
Colchicine itself is a potent inhibitor of microtubule assembly, which has been applied in medicine 
for over a thousand years. It is currently used to treat gout, Behcets disease, pericarditis and 
familial Mediterranean fever due to its antiinflammatory and antivascular effects.13 Due of its 
high toxicity against normal cells, colchicine is not approved for the cancer therapy.14 However, 
development of its analogs with increased potency and reduced toxicity, which can serve as 
anticancer agents, is of great interest. Like in case of vinca alkaloids, vinblastine and vincristine, 
which are structurally very similar but are known to be effective against different types of cancer 
and have substantially different levels of toxicity,7 other colchicine site binders may be less toxic
