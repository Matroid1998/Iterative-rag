Description:
Used as an axial ligand in manganese and rhenium tricarbonyl compounds.

Text:
The complexes were shown to be effective in a zebrafish infection 
model.15,16 
Manganese, the firstrow transition metal congener of rhenium, has also been 
explored by several groups for its antibacterial properties. Due to the higher lability of 
the carbonyl ligands, manganese tricarbonyl complexes have been studied 
extensively as COreleasing molecules (CORM). Mendes et al. have synthesised and 
studied a series of manganese and rhenium tricarbonyl compounds bearing the 
antifungal drug clotrimazole as an axial ligand.
