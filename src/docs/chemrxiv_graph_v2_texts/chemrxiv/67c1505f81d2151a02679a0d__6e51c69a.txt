Description:
Exhibit unique surface redox properties crucial for heterogeneous catalysis, solid oxide fuel cells, and solar-driven fuel generation.

Text:
The ability to manipulate electronic structures in functional materials has dramatically advanced 
their use in energy conversion, catalysis, and environmental applications1,2. Among these, 
reducible rare earth oxides (REO2x, where RE  Ce, Pr, Tb) exhibit unique surface redox 
properties, which play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis3, solid oxide fuel cells4, and solar
driven fuel generation5. Central to these redox properties is the formation and annihilation of 
oxygen vacancies, which serve as reactive sites for adsorption, charge transfer, and mass transport. These processes are intricately linked to the electronic structure of 4f bands in rare earth oxides, 
where charge transfer between surface oxygen (O 2p) and the adjacent rare earth (RE 4f) orbitals 
drives redox activity10.

Description:
Characterized by surface redox capacity important for catalytic activity.

Text:
Developing methods to create flatter films with wider terraces and fewer defects is essential for 
achieving substantial strain27 to modulate the electronic structure effectively. The redox kinetics is an important metric for the catalytic activity of REO2x under realistic 
reaction conditions as it has been found to be ratelimiting step in the Marsvan Krevelen 
mechanism8. Although the surface redox capacity in rare earth oxides has been characterized by
