Copper (Cu) is an essential element in our civilization and pivotal for diverse 
2 
applications. In catalysis, partially oxidized Cu, emphasizing cuprous (Cu) centers 
3 
formed on metallic Cu, has often been suggested as a candidate for active centers in CO 
4 
oxidation1, methanol reforming2, and electrochemical CO2 reduction3. Atomiclevel 
5 
insight into the initial stage of Cu oxidation is thus critical to understand the formation 
6 
of active Cu centers and associated reaction mechanisms under catalytically realistic 
7 
conditions4. Surfacesensitive techniques have been employed to study Cu oxidation 
8 
in the past decades5. 9 
On Cu(111), Jensen et al.5d, 5e first reported the formation of 44 and 29 surface 
10 
oxides, featuring unit cells 44 and 29 times the size of the Cu(111) primitive cell.
