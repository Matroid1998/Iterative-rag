Description:
Compounds used as catalysts to accelerate polymerization kinetics.

The success of PHUs is largely related to the rapid development of 
sustainable procedures for the synthesis of 5CC precursors such as the CO2epoxide coupling 
chemistry 37 or the carbonatation of biosourced 1,2diols.812 However, 5CC aminolysis comes 
with several drawbacks including (i) slow kinetics and extensive side reactions that hinder high 
polymerization degree 1315 and (ii) a lack of regio and stereocontrol resulting in poorly 
defined polymers.11,16 Many catalysts have already been proposed to accelerate the 
polymerization kinetics, including Nbases, metal salts and thiourea compounds.17,18 While 
they accelerate the reaction, they currently do not solve the regio and stereoregularity issues. Yet, regularity in the arrangement of polymer backbones neighboring units is of paramount 
importance, as it is critical to their bulk performances.
