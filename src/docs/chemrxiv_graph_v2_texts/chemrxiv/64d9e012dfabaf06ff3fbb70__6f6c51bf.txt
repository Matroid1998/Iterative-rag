Description:
A hydroxamate-based HDAC inhibitor approved for treating hematological malignancies.

Text:
The ZBG 
is responsible for chelating Zn2 ion in the active site of HDACs. Different ZBGs have been 
used for the development of HDACi, e.g. hydroxamic acids, 2aminobenzamides, shortchain 
fatty acids, thiols, alkylhydrazides, and others 12, 13. In addition, cyclic peptides without a 
ZBG have been reported as HDACi 14. To date, four HDACi have been approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of different types of hematological 
malignancies. These include the hydroxamatebased inhibitors vorinostat, belinostat, and 
panobinostat, as well as the thiolprodrugdepsipeptide (romidepsin) 11. Although 
hydroxamic acid is a potent and widely used ZBG, it was observed that hydroxamatebased 
HDAC inhibitors often lack HDACisoform selectivity and show offtarget side effects 15, 
16.
