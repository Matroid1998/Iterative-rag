Description:
FAU-type zeolites with SiAl ratios below 1.5.

Text:
FAUtype zeolites with SiAl ratios 
below 1.5 are dubbed zeolite X. Zeolite X samples exchanged with different cations were 
investigated for the storage and delivery of the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide,8 the anti
inflammatory and cytostatic 6mercaptopurine,9 the antiosteoporosis drugs risedronate and 
zoledronate,10 and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin,11 among other species. More siliconrich FAU
type zeolites are labelled zeolite Y, they were studied, for example, as host materials for the 
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen12 and for the antibiotics sulfadiazine13 and 
isoniazid.14 Looking beyond drug delivery, highly siliceous zeolite Y, which possesses 
hydrophobic properties, could find use as adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals and 
other organic contaminants from wastewaters.1518
