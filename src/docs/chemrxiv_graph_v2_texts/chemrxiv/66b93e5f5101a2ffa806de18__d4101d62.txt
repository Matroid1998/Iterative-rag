Description:
Forms dendritic and mossy microstructures that can be fully excited by X-band microwave frequencies when thinner than the skin depth of 1.1 m.

Li metal2,29 or graphite33), result in a sharp signal centered at . For metallic anodes that are thicker than the penetration depth of the microwave radiation, also called skin 
depth (), only spins near the surface of the anode are excited and a Dysonian lineshape is observed with a 
phaseshift that depends on the ratio of the particle size to the skin depth. Prior work has shown that 
dendritic and mossy Li microstructures that are thinner than the skin depth for Li (  1.1 m) can be fully 
excited by Xband microwave frequencies and lead to a Lorentzian signal lineshape.29,34,35 
Magnetometry measures the magnetization of a sample placed in an external magnetic field.
