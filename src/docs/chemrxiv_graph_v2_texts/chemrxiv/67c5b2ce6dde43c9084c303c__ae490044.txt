Description:
Compounds synthesized through a short process involving functionalized building blocks and macrocyclization.

Text:
The 
synthetic steps to produce this monomer, as well as the macrocyclization step, have been optimized 
for reliable cyanostar production. The simplicity of synthesis, such as in the preparation of pillar5arenes,6,42 opens doors 
to the exploration of a receptors chemistry. The short synthesis of pillar5arenes often involves 
an initial step to make the functionalized building block followed by its macrocyclization. Typical
