Description:
A component of the MOF MIL88A, contributing to its structural properties.

Text:
reported that MIL88A(Fe), an iron MOF constructed using fumarate linkers with formula 
Fe3O(C4H2O4)3(H2O)2(X), exhibits an 85 increase in the unit cell volume between the dried, 
contracted form and the open, hydrated structure (Figure 1a).9 Other frameworks in this isoreticular 
series also exhibit these dynamic properties, for example MIL88D(Cr), where the linker is biphenyl
4,4dicarboxylate (bpdc), shows a 235 increase in unit cell volume when the dried solid is immersed 
in pyridine.10
