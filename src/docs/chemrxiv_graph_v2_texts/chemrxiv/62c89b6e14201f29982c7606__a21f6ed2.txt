Description:
An emitter used in blue OLEDs with a maximum EQE of 38.2 and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.28).

Text:
Indeed, the first commercialized TADF OLED devices are now on the 
market.3 For instance, one of the best red TADF OLED, which uses TPAPZCN as the emitter, 
has realized a record high maximum EQE (EQEmax) of 28.1 with an electroluminescence 
maximum, lEL, of 648 nm.4 For green OLEDs, the use of CzDBA as the emitter resulted in a 
device with an EQEmax of 37.8 with the lEL at 528 nm.5 Blue OLED employing TDBADI 
as the emitter showed a comparable high EQEmax of 38.2 with CIE coordinates of (0.15, 
0.28),6 and an OLED using a multiple resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitter, DABNA, 
achieved an EQEmax of 34.4 with a lEL at 469 nm and a fullwidth at halfmaximum (FWHM) 
of only 18 nm.7
