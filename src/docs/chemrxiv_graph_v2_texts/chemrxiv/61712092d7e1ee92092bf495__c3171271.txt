Description:
A nucleoside analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activities, currently in advanced clinical trials for Covid-19 treatment.

Text:
Molnupiravir 1 is a nucleoside analogue currently in the advanced stages of clinical trials for the 
treatment of Covid191. Positive clinical data prompted early termination of recent phase 3 trials in 
order to seek emergency use authorization to treat adult patients with mildtomoderate Covid19 
who are at risk of progressing to severity or hospitalization. The structural simplicity of Molnupiravir 
compared to alternative therapies (e.g. Remdesivir), combined with its oral availability and broad
spectrum antiviral activities, make it an attractive candidate for the global treatment of viral 
infections. In view of the urgent need to develop therapies for treating the Covid19 pandemic there 
has been considerable interest in developing synthetic routes to this API. The original synthesis 
required 10 steps and proceeded with 10 overall yield2,3.

Description:
Produced through an integrated biocatalytic process from readily available starting materials.

More streamlined approaches have 
subsequently been reported4,5,6,7,8, however these routes rely on chemical methods to install the N
hydroxy unit, which require elevated temperatures, prolonged reaction times, andor additional steps 
for activation and protectiondeprotection chemistry. These factors compromise reaction yields and 
process productivity, ultimately leading to increased costs. We sought to develop a more efficient and sustainable route to 1 that could be implemented on scale, 
where modification of the base to install the Nhydroxy unit is achieved catalytically using an 
engineered enzyme. Since Nhydroxycytidine 4 has previously been shown to undergo lipase 
catalyzed acylation at C5OH4,5, this approach would provide an integrated biocatalytic process to 
Molnupiravir 1 from readily available starting materials.
