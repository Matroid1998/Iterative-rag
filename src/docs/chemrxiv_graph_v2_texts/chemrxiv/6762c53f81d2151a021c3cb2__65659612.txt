Description:
Commodity polymers with optical properties, impact resistance, and flame retardancy.

Text:
The everincreasing production of plastics and its 
consequences in terms of waste, the release of microplastics 
and pollutants into the natural environment, has led to the 
urgent need to examine the endoflife of polymers. The 
global percentage of recycled plastic is estimated to be only 
16 , and largely depends on the polymer considered, as well 
as its form of use.1 Polycarbonates are one of the socalled 
commodity polymers, with a global annual market 
estimated at 4.7 million metric tons, making them the fifth
largest heteroatomcontaining polymer market.1 This 
family of polymers, largely dominated by poly(bisphenol A 
carbonate) (PBPAC), is used for its optical properties, impact 
resistance, flame retardancy, etc.

Description:
Polymers that can undergo hydrolysis and methanolysis with variable biodegradation yields.

Text:
Additionally, bisphenolA is known to 
be an endocrine disruptor, and is now well recognized as 
being particularly toxic to many ecosystems, thus 
highlighting the importance of studying its degradation.3 
Understanding the degradation of this polymer and its 
associated products, as well as the development of suitable 
and effective recycling routes, therefore seems inevitable if 
we are to contain its negative impact on the environment. Examples of PBPAC degradation studies are numerous in 
the literature, starting with hydrolysis and methanolysis, with 
complete depolymerization or yields in excess of 80 , 
analyzed mainly by infrared spectroscopy and gas 
chromography.46 Other studies have focused on the 
biodegradation of polycarbonates, but this time with highly 
variable yields.

Description:
Aliphatic polycarbonates can sometimes exceed 50 or even 70 yield on rare occasions, with degradation products analyzed by methods such as mass loss, infrared spectroscopy, and size-exclusion chromatography.

Text:
When it comes to aliphatic polycarbonates, 
they can sometimes exceed 50 , or even 70  yield on rare 
occasions, in the case of PBPAC, degradation barely reaches 
30 , leaving considerable room for improvement in this type 
of approach.79 Unlike for chemical methods, degradation 
products are then analyzed by a wider variety of methods, 
including mass loss, infrared spectroscopy and sizeexclusion 
chromatography (SEC). Finally, a certain number of studies 
have focused on weaker degradation processes, such as heat 
treatment or UV irradiation, using analytical methods such as 
SEC, MALDITOF, yellowness index, FTIR, or SEM.10
13 This very wide range of analytical methods is often used 
inconsistently between different studies, or even within the 
same study, creating a lack of clarity in understanding the 
phenomena involved.
