Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction which kinetically controls electrochemical water splitting.

Text:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) belongs to
one of the most studied electrochemical reactions
in the last decade. This is in large part due to
the OER kinetically controlling electrochemical wa
ter splitting 1. Facilitating efficient and scalable
electrochemical water splitting would enable accel
erated replacement of fossil fuel with green fuel
sources generated by renewable electricity. The OER is confined to oxidelike surfaces, which
often restructure under operando conditions. Ex
perimental development of oxygen evolving cata
lysts is done separately for acidic water electroly
sis 24 and alkaline media electrolysis 57. State
of the art OER catalysts for acidic electrolysis are
based on noble metal oxides such as RuO2 and
IrO2, the scarcity of which adversely affects large
scale deployment of this technology.
