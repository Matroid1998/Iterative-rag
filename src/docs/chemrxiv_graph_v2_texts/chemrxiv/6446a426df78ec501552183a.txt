Carbon dioxide, considered one of the main greenhouse gasses, has a major impact on cli
mate change. Its atmospheric concentration is already above 400 ppm and is predicted to
hit alarming levels in the 2050s1 if the current situation is not addressed properly. Emission
sources are numerous and contribute differently to the problem. They range from deforesta
tion and cement manufacturing to the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas, petroleum,
and coal. Consequently, sectors relying heavily on fossil fuels, such as power generation,
industrial, and transportation sectors, are the main sources of CO2 emissions worldwide.2
Current carbon capture and storage technologies have the potential to mitigate climate
