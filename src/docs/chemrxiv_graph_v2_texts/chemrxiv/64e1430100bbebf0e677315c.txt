Description:
A chalcogen atom that can form polarised bonds with electronegative substituents.

Text:
Chalcogen bonding is an attractive noncovalent interaction involving a Lewis basic species
and a molecule containing a polarised chalcogen atom (generally S, Se or Te bonded to an
electronegative substituent, X).1,2 It has found applications in many areas of chemistry, including
medicinal chemistry,37 materials chemistry,8,9 catalysis,10,11 anion sensing,1215 and supramolecular
chemistry.1619 Chalcogen bonding has both orbital interaction and electrostatic components. The
former involves charge transfer from the Lewis base nonbonded pair of electrons to an energetically
accessible orbital on the chalcogen, while the electrostatic component involves the attraction
between the Lewis base and the positively charged hole, which is generated along the extension
of the ChX bond due to polarisation of the chalcogens electron cloud.2022 This latter interaction
