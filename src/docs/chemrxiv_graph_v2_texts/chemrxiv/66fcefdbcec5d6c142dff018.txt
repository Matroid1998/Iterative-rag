Description:
A pigment whose excitation is quenched to dissipate excess energy in non-photochemical quenching.

Photosynthesis relies on a complex and delicate machinery that employs light to function
but can incur in photodamage if too much light is absorbed by the photosynthetic pig
ments. In plants and green algae, the lightharvesting complexes (LHCs) that absorb light
and funnel the excitation energy towards reaction centers can also regulate this flux in re
sponse to variations in light conditions.1 This regulation is necessary to avoid photodamage
to the photosystems themselves, and occurs within LHCs in a mechanism known as non
photochemical quenching (NPQ).28 When NPQ is triggered, chlorophyll (Chl) excitation is
readily quenched, providing a fast dissipation channel for the excess energy. Notwithstanding decadeslong work on single LHCs,912 thylakoid membranes,13 or even
intact leaves,14,15 the mechanisms underlying NPQ remain elusive.
