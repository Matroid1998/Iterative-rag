Description:
Hybrid vesicles that retain protein activity and enhance membrane protein folding.

PBd22
PEO14 blended with E.coli extracted lipids has been used to successfully reconstitute two ATP 
binding cassette membrane proteins, Pgp or NaAtm1.9 Combinations of membrane proteins have also 
been successfully reconstituted into PBdPEO hybrid vesicles F0F1 ATP synthase and 
bacteriorhodopsin in 50 mol PBd22PEO14POPC hybrid vesicles retained  50 of their activity 
after 42 days.10 Besides enhanced durability of protein function, block copolymers have been shown 
to enhance membrane protein folding into hybrid vesicles up to 25 mol of PBd22PEO14 or PBd12
PEO9 in DOPC hybrid vesicles enhanced MScL protein folding during cellfree expression.20 
Therefore improved understanding of the physicochemical properties of these hybrid membranes 
should further enhance their optimisation for membrane protein biotechnology.
