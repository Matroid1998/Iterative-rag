Furthermore, finding versatile polymerization conditions that 
accommodate various functional epoxides has been challenging. Consequently, endgroup 
modification of terminal hydroxy groups (PEGylation, Scheme 1B) has been predominantly 
employed. However, the installation of multiple functionalities is restricted due to the limited 
number of hydroxyl groups per chain. Moreover, the modification site is limited to the chains 
end. Scheme 1. General strategies for functionalized PEO synthesis. Polymer functionalization through postpolymerization modification (PPM) is a 
promising route for rapid and efficient polymer modification.1112 However, direct CH bond 
functionalization of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) has been challenging and not extensively 
explored. Historically, CH bonds have been regarded as inert and crucial for providing 
molecular stability. Nonetheless, recent advances in synthetic methodologies have enabled the
