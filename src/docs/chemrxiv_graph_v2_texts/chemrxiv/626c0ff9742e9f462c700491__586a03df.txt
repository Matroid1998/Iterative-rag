Description:
Promotes reductive dimerization cyclization of gemdiactivated alkenes.

Text:
Alkyl ringsubstituted ethyl PCAs were prepared and copolymerized with styrene 12; in 
studies of catalytic activity of mesoporous molecular sieve RbAlKIT1 in organic reactions 13, 
and in metallic samarium promoted reductive dimerization cyclization of gemdiactivated alkenes, 
reductive debromination of vicdibromides, in reduction of sodium alkyl thiosulfates in aqueous 
media 14.
