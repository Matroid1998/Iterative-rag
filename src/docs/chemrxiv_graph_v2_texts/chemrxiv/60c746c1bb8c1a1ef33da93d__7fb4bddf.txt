Participates in the activation of O2 on the surface of nanoporous gold.

Ligandfunctionalized and oxidesupported gold nanoparticles have been intensively studied in 
catalytic science over the past three decades, and considerable progress has been achieved in 
understanding the underlying catalytic mechanisms.17 In contrast, the mechanistic understanding 
of catalytic processes ocurring on nanoporous gold (npAu), a threedimensional nanoporous 
material, is still far less developed, even though high activities and selectivities have been observed 
in (partial) oxidation reactions.812 Theoretical studies have been debating on the mechanism of 
such reactions with dioxygen on npAu, especially on the role of undercoordinated surface atoms 
and impurities of a less noble metal (usually silver) left over from the preparation of npAu, which 
is obtained by selective leaching this less noble metal out of a corresponding Au alloy.1318 Whereas 
most studies suggest a significant participation of the second metal (Ag) in the activation of O2 on 
the surface of npAu, some studies also suggest a possible role of chemisorbed oxygen on Au sites 
in facilitating O2 dissociation,17, 19 or as a driving force for Ag segregation to the surface.13, 20 The 
remarkable catalytic activity and high selectivity of nanoporous gold render this material 
interesting for a variety of practically interesting reactions ranging from CO oxidation to more 
complex organic transformations.2124 However, an possible limitation when envisioning a use of 
npAu in commercial catalysis is the limited thermodynamic stability resulting from the nanosize 
of its ligaments in the range of a few 10 nm and its therefore high surface energy.
