The catalytic conversion of propylene, a key intermediate in the petrochemical indus
try, holds significant importance in the synthesis of valuable chemical products.1 The
oligomerization of propylene to obtain higher olefins demonstrates promising applica
tions in fragrances, gasoline additives, and agrochemicals while also serving as valu
able feedstocks for producing polymer films and thermoplastic resins.27 Among various
catalytic systems, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as highly versatile
materials, gaining significant attention for their wideranging potential in various cat
alytic applications.8 Their modular structure, characterized by nodes and linkers with
specific structure and composition, positions them as ideal platforms for catalyst screen
ing and the customization of their catalytic properties.
