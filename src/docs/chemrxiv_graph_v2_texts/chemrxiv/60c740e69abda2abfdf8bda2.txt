Description:
A widely used solvent in NMR sample preparation.

Text:
One costeffective way to avoid deuterated solvents is the No D NMR, which is used 
55 
for monitoring of reactions and determining the concentration of reagents.45 However, this 
56 
method does not increase sensitivity, so the running cost due to spectrometer time is still 
57 
there. Busy organic chemistry labs may need substantial amounts of NMR solvents annually, 
58 
and CDCl3 is used most widely in sample preparation. More expensive deuterated solvents
