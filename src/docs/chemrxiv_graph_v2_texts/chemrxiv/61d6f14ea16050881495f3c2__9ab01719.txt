Description:
Metal ions with fast ligand exchange.

Text:
This description works well for organic molecules, where the 
solvent acts only as a solvent shell. For metal ions, especially 
those with fast ligand exchange such as the lanthanides,8 this 
description becomes problematic as the distinctions between 
the coordination spheres and solvent shells are inconsistent. For 
example, the water molecules in close contact to a metal ion are 
typically regarded as ligands and not as a solvent shell. Further, 
the solvent separated ion pair used by Marcus  Hefter is iden
tical to two complex ions in close contact. In order to avoid con
fusion, we have categorized the metalanion interactions into 
four Types (see Figure 1). In Type I, there is direct coordination 
of the anion to the metal ion.
