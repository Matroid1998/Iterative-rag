Description:
A direct method for isotopically labeling them would be highly valuable.

Specifically, isotopic labeling is 
instrumental in studying organic reaction mechanisms and evaluating biologically relevant 
molecules.1,2 Nitrogen15 labeling, in particular, induces dipolar NMR activity in nitrogen
containing compounds, thus enabling the utilization of various powerful analytical techniques 
(Figure 1A).1,35 Nitrogen heterocycles are prevalent in drug compounds, agrochemicals, 
materials, and natural products, making their selective modification crucial for discovery 
campaigns in these industries.68 Given the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in functional 
molecules, especially pharmaceuticals, and the significance of isotopic labeling in applications 
like biomolecular NMR,1,35 structural analysis,9 in vivo metabolomics,1012 mechanism 
elucidation, solutionstate mechanics,1318 and spin hyperpolarization (particularly by SABRE
SHEATH, Figure 1B),1921 we anticipated that a direct method for isotopically labeling nitrogen 
heteroaromatics would be highly valuable.
