Description:
A pigment that increases in concentration to harvest more light in photosynthetic organisms.

Text:
Photoacclimation is a process performed by photosynthetic organisms that is used to 
regulate their internal energy production following a change in light intensity.1 For example, a 
decrease in light intensity will trigger a photosynthetic organism to increase its intracellular 
chlorophyll concentration, allowing each cell to harvest more light in order to compensate for the 
loss of incident light. In addition to compensating for overall changes in light intensity, 
photoacclimation can also be used to offset the loss of light in a specific wavelength region.
