Description:
A product formed from hydrosilylation of nitriles.

Amines are one of the most important functional groups 
in organic chemistry and are ubiquitous in material science, 
dyes, agrochemicals, and pharmaceutical agents.14 To date, 
the most widespread synthetic approaches to generate 
amines are via Nalkylation, reductive amination of a car
bonyl compound, and amide reductions.512 Although these 
approaches are routinely used, they do suffer from poor
atom economy, deleterious onward reactivity, and ac
cesscost of starting materials.1315 Another wellestab
lished approach towards the synthesis of amines is hydrob
oration of compounds containing unsaturated CN bonds, 
which has garnered renewed interest due to high selectivity 
and mild reaction conditions.16 The reduction of nitriles via 
hydroboration selectively furnishes diborylamine moieties 
which can readily undergo hydrolysis to generate free pri
mary amines, unlike hydrosilylation which forms a mixture 
of the monosilylated imine and disilylamine products.17 
Hydroboration can also be successfully applied as a viable 
route to access saturated Nheterocycles from the corre
sponding Nheteroarenes, which are prevalent in bioactive 
molecules.18,19 To date, a wide range of complexes from 
across the periodic table are known to successfully catalyze 
the hydroboration of unsaturated CN bonds, however 
many show only moderate catalytic activity and are deemed 
unattractive due to their precious or pyrophoric nature.2022 
As one of the most abundant metals on earth, iron offers 
a level of sustainable and longstanding availability, accom
panied by low toxicity that is unorthodox compared to other 
transition metals.
