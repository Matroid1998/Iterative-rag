Description:
A dopant that can affect the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots.

. InP colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have raised 
considerable interest for photonic technologies operating in the 
visible and nearinfrared, because of their tunable band gap in 
the range of 1.3  3 eV, strong light absorption, efficient lumi
nescence and compliance with European safety regulations on 
electronic products (ROHS).1 However, the size dependent op
tical properties of InP CQDs have not been reported to the level 
of detail that is common for other CQDs. This is due to difficul
ties in synthesizing luminescent samples of various sizes with 
narrow size distributions free of dopants (e.g. Zn) or shells (e.g. ZnSe1xSx). In this regard, considerable progress has been re
cently achieved. On one hand the works of Won et al., Li et al. and Xu et al.
