Description:
A hydrophobic, chainlike molecule that can be incorporated into lipid membranes.

demonstrated the
effect of polystyrene 25mers on DPPC membrane dynam
ics, thermal and mechanical properties using calorimetry, X
ray and neutron scattering 5. Very recently, we showed
with 2H NMR that about 35vol of ntriacontane (C30) can
be incorporated into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
or dimirystoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) membranes 22. This system is a perfect starting point for investigating the
crystallization of hydrophobic, chainlike molecules inside
lipid membranes. The crystallization behaviour of bulk nalkane itself is no
table due to the existence of the socalled rotator phases,
which may be formed prior to the crystalline phase upon cool
ing 23, 24. These rotator phases are defined by a rotational
freedom along the long axis of the molecules, while the posi
tional long range order is retained along all dimensions.
