Description:
An anticoagulant that can prevent coagulation.

Text:
Thus, treatment with anticoagulant does alter the 
26 
natural coagulation that would occur within the pool as it dried, affecting both the physical and 
27 
chemical properties of the blood pool.2,3,11 
28 
While physiologically necessary, rapid coagulation complicates the experimental 
29 
preparation of blood pools for TSD research, particularly requiring almost immediate deposition, 
30 
which could be logistically challenging. Anticoagulants such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
31 
(EDTA), heparin, and citrate solutions can prevent coagulation.
