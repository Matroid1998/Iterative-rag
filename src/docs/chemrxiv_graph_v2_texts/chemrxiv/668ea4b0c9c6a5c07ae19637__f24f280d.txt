Description:
A metal used in solid-state lithium metal batteries for high energy density and safety.

Text:
Solidstate lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are recognized as the future of energy storage 
technology, offering unparalleled energy densities and safety that far exceed those of current 
lithiumion batteries1. However, the widespread adoption of solidstate LMBs in sectors such 
as electric vehicles, electric aviation and energy storage is hindered by significant challenges, 
particularly in the development of electrolyte materials.
