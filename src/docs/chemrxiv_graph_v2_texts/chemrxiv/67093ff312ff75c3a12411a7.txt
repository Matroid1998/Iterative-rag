Generally, electrochemical water splitting consists of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; on 
the cathode) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER; on the anode). This reaction requires a 
theoretical potential of 1.23 V vs. SHE (Eq. (i) and (ii)), however, due to thermodynamic 
limitations, the applied voltage is always higher.12,13 Notably, UOR occurs at a much lower
