Description:
Associated with reactive oxygen species in the process of ferroptosis.

Cell death is a key player in various cellular processes, including the regulation of tissue growth, 
embryogenesis, cell turnover, immune response, and numerous other biological activities. Among 
the various cell death processes, apoptosis and ferroptosis have shown remarkable efficacy and 
hold great potential for clinical applications within the domain of nanomedicine1,2. Apoptosis is a 
programmed cell death and occurs on demand by the physiological requirement to clean the waste 
material. On the other hand, ferroptosis is a regulatory cell death process that results from the iron
dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides connected with reactive oxygen species3,4. It is known 
that the dead cell is an indicator of various diseases such as traumatic brain injury, heart attack, 
and autoimmune response.
