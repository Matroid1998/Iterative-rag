Description:
A polymer known for its widespread use due to its distinctive properties.

Text:
The extensive diffusion of plastic materials over the last decades has become a critical environmental 
challenge, threatening ecosystems worldwide. From the accumulation of plastic debris in soils to the 
pervasive spread of micro and nanoplastics in marine environments, the adverse effects of plastic pollution 
are welldocumented. 13 Among these polymers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) stands out due to its 
widespread use, driven by its distinctive properties.
