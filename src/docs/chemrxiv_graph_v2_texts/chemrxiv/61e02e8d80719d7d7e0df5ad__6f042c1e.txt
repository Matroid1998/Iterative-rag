Description:
A costly electrocatalyst material required in large amounts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

Electrification of the transport sector and the transition towards renewable energy 
solutions is crucial in the race towards cutting the greenhouse gas emissions. While battery 
electric vehicles are already leading the way, an important part of the electrification puzzle will 
be fuel cell electric vehicles 1. One of the main barriers preventing mass adoption of proton 
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology remains the highcost of the electrocatalyst 
material 2. Due to the inherently sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a large amount of 
platinum (Pt) is required, which would represent over 50 of the total membrane electrode 
assembly (MEA) manufacturing costs 3 making it also the highest cost contributor to the entire 
stack 4.

Description:
A critical raw material with high activity, high electrochemically active surface area, and high durability, but limited in supply and expensive.

Text:
In addition, Pt is a low earth abundancy, expensive critical raw material, which is 
limited in supply. In order to achieve significant cost reductions the amount of Pt in the cathode 
electrocatalyst must be reduced. High activity, high electrochemically active surface area 
(ECSA) as well as high durability are all necessary for achieving significant improvements 5,6. While completely eliminating platinum group metals (PGMs) by the use of PGMfree 
electrocatalysts 7 might seem a rational approach to reduce the costs, achieving sufficient power 
densities as well as durability of PGMfree electrocatalysts remain a major challenge with 
currently no clear solution in sight 6,810.
