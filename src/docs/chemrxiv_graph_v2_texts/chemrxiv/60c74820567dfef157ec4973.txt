Description:
Characterized by electronic structure properties involving weak mixing of valence f-orbitals with ligands, dominated by spin-orbit J-multiplets.

The use of lanthanoid atoms as central metal ions in inorganic
complexes seems to be the most promising way to achieve Sin
gle Molecule Magnets (SMM) with high operational tempera
tures15. This promise comes from the characteristic electronic
structure properties of the lanthanide complexes, which involve
only a weak mixing of the valence forbitals with the ligand. The valence space of these systems is more akin to atomic 4 f
orbitals, and like their atomic counterparts, the electronic struc
ture of these complexes is dominated by spinorbit Jmultiplets,
that are only weakly split by electronic interaction with the lig
and eld6,7.
