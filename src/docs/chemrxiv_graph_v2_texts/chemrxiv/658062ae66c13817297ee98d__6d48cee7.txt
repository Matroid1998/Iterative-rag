Description:
Photoanodes with PEC performance below the theoretical limit, with positive photocurrent onset potentials.

Text:
However, 
the PEC performance of pristine BiVO4 photoanodes is typically far below the 
theoretical limit, both in terms of maximum photocurrents and achievable 
photovoltages, the latter manifested by rather positive photocurrent onset potentials
