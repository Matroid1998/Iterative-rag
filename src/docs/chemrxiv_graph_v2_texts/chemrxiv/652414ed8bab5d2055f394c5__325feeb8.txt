Description:
Constructed through synthetic methods involving metathesis.

Text:
Reactions 
mediated by metal alkylidene were also developed.31 Another valuable approach is 
the indirect hydrazinecatalyzed carbonylolefin metathesis, which involves the 32
cycloadditioncycloreversion of in situ formed azomethine imine and olefin.32 This 
chemistry has had a significant impact on synthetic methods, particularly in the 
construction of new alkene functionalities.33
