Description:
A naturally occurring actinide element that is radioactive.

Text:
Actinide compounds are the major constituents of general radioactive waste produced by nuclear 
power plants and special radioactive waste called fuel debris generated from power plant 
accidents such as those that occurred in the FukushimaDaiichi Nuclear Power Plant.1 
Comprehensive understanding of the properties of actinide compounds is important for separating 
and reusing the actinides from the radioactive waste or to decommission Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Plant safely. However, actinides are artificially synthesized elements (except for 
uranium) and are inherently hazardous due to their radioactive nature, leading to enormous 
constraints in experiments aimed at elucidating their properties. For safety and feasibility, it is 
desirable to perform quantum chemical calculations of actinide compounds to understand their 
basic electronic structures.
