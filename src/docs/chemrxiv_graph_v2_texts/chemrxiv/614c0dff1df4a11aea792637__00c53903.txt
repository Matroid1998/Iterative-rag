Description:
A product of complete dehydrogenation of methane by nickel catalysts.

Text:
However, stability
of methane makes it resistant to electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. For most methane
conversion reactions, the rst CH bond cleavage is the primary and the ratelimiting step. This motivates the rational design of a catalyst aiming at reducing the activation barrier for
CH bond dissociation. Planar and stepped nickel surfaces are goto catalysts used industrially in the aforemen
tioned processes, primarily because Ni is procured at cheap rates and portrays excellent
reactivity towards methane. The drawback of Ni catalysts is that they can completely dehy
drogenate methane into carbon and hydrogen, which causes coking. Nullifying or preventing
coking in methane conversion reactions is challenging area of current research.
