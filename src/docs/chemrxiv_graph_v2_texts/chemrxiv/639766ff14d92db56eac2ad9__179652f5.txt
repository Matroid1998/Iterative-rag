Description:
Induces p21 protein expression in a p53-independent manner in oligodendroglialike cells.

Text:
Uberti et al., concluded that following 
H2O2 insult, oligodendroglialike cells express p21 protein in a 
p53independent manner.20 Controversially, a recent report 
shows the accumulation of p21 protein level upon H2O2 exposure 
in RPETert cells.22 Using CRISPRCASP9derived RPETert p53 KO 
cells, p21 was not expressed, suggesting an induced p53
dependent mechanism. Herein, we performed native MS and ion 
mobility (IM)MS studies on p53 in the absence and presence of 
p21 RE and profiled reactive cysteine residues to finally examined 
the H2O2induced molecular mechanism on the tetrameric DNA
p53 complex. Results and Discussion 
Mapping the conformational landscape of p53 on 
DNA binding
