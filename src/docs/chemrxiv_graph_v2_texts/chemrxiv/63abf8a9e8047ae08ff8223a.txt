Description:
Can be swiftly oxidized to the corresponding carbonyls upon treatment with a strong base under atmospheric conditions.

The utilization of alcohols as alkylation surrogates for aldehydes represents a highly desirable 
reaction route in organic chemistry since alcohols can be directly obtained from biomass.1 Therefore, 
efficient catalytic procedures for in situ generation of carbonyl moieties, based on noble2 and non
precious transition metals3 were described in the last decades by a manifold of researchers, including 
reports from our group.4 However, it has been shown that benzyl alcohols can be swiftly oxidized to 
the corresponding carbonyls upon treatment with a strong base under atmospheric conditions.5 In 
fact, various condensation reactions6 can be carried out with benzyl alcohols in presence of a 
(catalytic amount of) base without transitionmetal complexes.
