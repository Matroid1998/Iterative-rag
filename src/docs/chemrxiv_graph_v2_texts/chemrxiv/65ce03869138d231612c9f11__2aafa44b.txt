Description:
A metal used in lithium-ion batteries, where its deposition can lead to dendrite formation.

Dendrites present a significant challenge in the development of highenergy Liion batteries. To combat
dendrite formation, a deeper understanding of the causes for their formation is crucial. During electrode
position, uneven metal deposits can lead to dendritic structures with higher local electric fields. This
creates a cycle where metal preferentially accumulates in the highfield region, causing dendrite growth1,2. Similar challenges exist in liquid electrolyte lithiumion batteries. To mitigate dendrite growth, extensive
research has been focused on the utilization of additives and diverse charging protocols, aiming to achieve
a more homogeneous lithium deposition and inhibit dendrite formation26. Solid electrolytes on the other
hand were postulated to stop the dendrite growth by creating a mechanical barrier, where the growing soft
lithium metal would be stopped7.
