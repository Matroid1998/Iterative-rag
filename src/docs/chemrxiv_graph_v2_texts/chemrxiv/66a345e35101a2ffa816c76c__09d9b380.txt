Description:
Undergoes partial amorphisation at pressures relevant to tableting.

Compressioninduced phase transformations in pharmaceuticallyrelevant organic materials is an area 
of current interest due to the increasing number of compounds that undergo such changes in pressure 
ranges relevant to pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.1 These changes have a material impact 
on the functionality of the compounds giving rise to potential changes in, for example, mechanical 
properties2 and solubility.3 Changes to the solidform have also been observed at pressures relevant 
to tableting, including polymorphic transformations (e.g. chlorpropamide4,5), partial amorphisation 
(e.g. theophylline, nitrofurantoin, amlodipine besylate6), and crystallization of amorphous drugs (e.g. indomethacin, sucrose, celecoxib1,7), using a range of characterization techniques including 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), spectroscopy and Xray and neutron diffraction.
