Description:
Involved in altering the activity of potassium channels in cardiomyocytes.

Text:
This is commonly referred to as the primary role of the Tat protein 5. 65 
Additionally, numerous pathological conditions are also associated with the Tat protein. For 
66 
example, it inhibits phagocytosis in macrophages by binding to phosphoinositol4,5biphosphate 
67 
(PI4,5P2) on cell membranes 6 and alters the activity of potassium channels in cardiomyocytes 
68 
7. Some others involve triggering neurodegeneration 8, disrupting the bloodbrain barrier 9, 
69 
and inducing apoptosis in T cells 10. In summary, this protein performs many tasks in the 
70 
extracellular and intracellular milieu and with that, it rightly has earned the reputation of being the 
71 
main viral toxin of the HIV1 virus 11. 72
