Description:
Generated through technologies that use fossil fuels or hydrocarbons, or renewable energy-based technologies using water or biomass.

Text:
Hydrogen is an important clean energy carrier for decarbonization due to the absence of 
carbon dioxide emissions upon combustion or use in a fuel cell. Although the dominant H2 
production technologies use fossil fuels or hydrocarbons, the development of renewableenergy
based technologies using ubiquitous feedstocks, such as water or biomass, would realize 
sustainable, netlow, or even netzeroemission systems.1,2 The H2 generated then needs to be 
transported to and stored at the point of use.
