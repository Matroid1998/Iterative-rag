Given the increasing global demand for energy, numerous researchers are actively 
37 
exploring renewable resources with reduced environmental impact compared to 
38 
traditional sources like petroleum and coal. Brazil stands out globally in this context as 
39 
48 of its energy matrix is renewable 7. In the biofuel sector, using ethanol from 
40 
sugarcane biomass in flexfuel engines has brought the country into focus, showcasing its 
41 
success in substituting petroleum derivatives with renewable fuels. 42 
Aside from ethanol, biodiesel and butanol are alternatives to conventional fuel 22. 43 
Biodiesel is the product of the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils or animal fats 
44 
with a shortchain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol 27.
