Description:
Exhibits intrinsic polarization and piezoelectricity.

Text:
These three
abundant neighboring elements in the periodic table have
an almost equivalent atomic size and mass, and lightweight
are benign to the environment to form pBCN exhibiting
intrinsic polarization and piezoelectricity 16, and lattice
thermal conductivity up to 97.49 Wm1 K1 at room tem
perature 32. Moreover, the hydrogenation in pristine p
BCN changes it from a direct bandgap of 1.70 eV to an
indirect bandgap of 4.46 eV. The bandgap of hydrogenated
pBCN is tuneable up to 3.26 eV under the biaxial strain. Although the elastic modulus tensor is reduced due to the
hydrogenation, the spontaneous polarization is reported to
be signicantly enhanced 17. The bandgap of pBCN calculated by using Heyd
ScuseriaErnzerhof (HSE) 18 hybrid functional within
DFT is in the visible range.
