Fig. 1 Overview of radical difunctionalization of alkynes and our bifunctional reagents mediated strategy 
difunctionalization of alkynes (Fig. 1 B). Inspired by the abovementioned seminal works and our 
previous reports on the radical difunctionalizations4749, we conceived the idea that aryl rings 
anchored to acetates via SO2 could serve as a potential bifunctional reagent.
