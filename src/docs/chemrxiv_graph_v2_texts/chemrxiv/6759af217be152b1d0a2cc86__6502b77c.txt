Description:
A molecule involved in electrochemical capture approaches and adsorption processes.

Text:
Compared with other batterytype 
electrochemical CO2 capture approaches based on electrochemicallydriven pH swings (57), redoxactive 
CO2binding molecules (811) and electrochemically mediated amine regeneration (1214), the SSAbased 
technology exhibits outstanding energy efficiency and stability (15). Recent works have optimized electrode 
materials (15, 16), electrolyte compositions (17, 18), and charging protocols (1921) for SSA. Even with this 
progress, there is still a lack of a clear pathway to enhance the relatively low CO2 adsorption capacities of SSA 
(approximately 100 mmol CO2 per kg of the active mass of the working electrode) owing in part to the 
incomprehensive mechanistic understanding of SSA (21).

Description:
A gas with adsorption capacity that increases with decreasing applied current in a Zn-ion hybrid capacitor.

Text:
Our asymmetric supercapacitorbattery hybrid system (i.e., Znion hybrid 
capacitor) exhibited an increasing trend in the CO2 adsorption capacity with a decreasing applied current (208 
mmolCO2 kg1 at 1 mA g1), surpassing that of the symmetric supercapacitor which showed decreased CO2 
adsorption capacities under slow charging conditions. Our approach introduces an entirely new supercapacitor
battery hybrid system for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides insights into the competing processes in 
symmetric supercapacitors for SSA. Furthermore, this work shows that the concept of asymmetric 
supercapacitors for SSA can be generally extended using other counter electrode materials (e.g., microporous
