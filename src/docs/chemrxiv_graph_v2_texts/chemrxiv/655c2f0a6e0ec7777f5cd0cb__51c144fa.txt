Description:
Incorporated into helicenes to form helicene nanoribbons.

Text:
For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene 
units are partially replaced by anthracene units to increase 
the diameter of helicenes,6) and perylene bisimideincorpo
rated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthe
sized.7) These diameterexpanded helicene analogues dis
play interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical proper
ties.
