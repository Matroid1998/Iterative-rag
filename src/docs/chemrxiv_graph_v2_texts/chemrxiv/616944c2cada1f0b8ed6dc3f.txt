Description:
Conjugated polymer chains involved in charge transfer interactions.

This ob
servation, while invoking the general interest in double
doping, also calls for a more detailed understanding of
the underlying mechanisms, as well as of material and
parameter dependencies. For example further details of
the charge formation such as formation of individual po
larons andor bipolarons upon doubledoping are of sig
nicant relevance for the transport properties of the re
sulting doped system.1722
In this work, we investigate a simultaneous charge
transfer between two p(g42TTT) conjugated polymer
(oligomer) chains in a close arrangement and a single
CN6CP ptype dopant molecule as illustrated in Fig
ure 1(a). Our study is rmly based on density func
tional theory (DFT) calculations taking into account
intermolecular vander Waals interactions and dielectric
environment.
