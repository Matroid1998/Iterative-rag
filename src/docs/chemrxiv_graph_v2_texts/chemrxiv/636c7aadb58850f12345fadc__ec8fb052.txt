Description:
A catalyst recovered after reductive elimination in the eamination process.

Text:
The LNiII(Ar)Br intermediate is then converted to a NiII 
aryl amido complex, LNiII(Ar)(NR1R2), through amine ligand exchange. Anodic oxidation 
provides an oxidized NiIII aryl amido complex LNiIII (Ar)(NR1R2)Br for reductive elimination to 
produce the aryl eamination product and recover the LNiIBr catalyst. The direct amine ligand 
exchange for the LNiIII(Ar)Br2 intermediate to form LNiIII (Ar)(NR1R2)Br was proposed as a 
minor pathway (dashed catalytic arrow in Scheme 1). Scheme 1. NiCatalyzed eAmination and Previously Proposed Mechanism.
