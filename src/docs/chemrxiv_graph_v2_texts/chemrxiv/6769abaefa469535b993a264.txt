Description:
A redox-active material used in alkaline redox flow batteries with record capacity retention rates.

Text:
An aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) is a type of redox flow battery that utilises 
organic redoxactive material, dissolved in an aqueous electrolyte.16 The battery is comprised of 
two liquid electrolytes, the anolyte and the catholyte, also known as the negolyte and posolyte, 
respectively.79 These electrolytes are stored externally in reservoirs and are pumped into an 
electrochemical cell to be charged, and later discharged.5,8,9 The anolyte and catholyte are 
separated by an ionselective membrane, which is designed to conduct chargebalancing ions, 
whilst preventing the mixing of the redoxactive material.7,1013 As the energy is stored in solution, 
rather than in the electrode, the capacity of these devices is easily scaled to meet the requirements 
of gridlevel storage.9,14,15 
Redox flow batteries can be composed from a variety of redoxactive materials.7,8,13 AORFBs 
are of particular interest because they can be made from lowcost, Earthabundant and nontoxic 
materials.14,16,17 Alkaline anthraquinoneferrocyanide batteries are a prime example of AORFB, 
which hold record capacity retention rates within the field.1,2,1720 These batteries are now in the 
process of being commercialized, though they currently exist on a small scale.14,17,18,20 Two of the 
main processes limiting the economic viability of anthraquinoneferrocyanide batteries are 
electrolyte degradation and crossover (i.e., unwanted transport of redoxactive material through 
the membrane).11,2127 Both the battery materials and charging protocols need to be carefully 
designed to minimize these degradation processes and improve battery lifetime.12,23,24,2729
