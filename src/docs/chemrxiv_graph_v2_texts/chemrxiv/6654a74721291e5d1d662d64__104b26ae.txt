Description:
Contains the Tyr C6toTrp N1 linkage.

Text:
To date, among the natural products isolated, only 
four are known to contain the Tyr C6toTrp N1 linkage 
lapparbin (1), neopetromin (2), tryptorubins, and nocapeptin A.3, 4 
Notably, the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), neopetromin (2), and 
nocapeptin A has not yet been reported. The sole reported 
instance for constructing the Tyr C6toTrp N1 linkage and the 
total synthesis of tryptorubins was reported by Baran et al. in 2020, 
utilizing intramolecular Ullmann coupling with CuI catalyst as the 
key reaction.5 Additionally, although some biological activity 
assays for lapparbin (1) have been conducted, its definitive 
biological activity remains unidentified.3 
 The synthetic plan for lapparbin (1) is depicted in Figure 1A.

Description:
A compound synthesized with a highly strained atropTyr C6toTrp N1 linkage.

Text:
The most challenging aspect of the total synthesis of lapparbin (1) 
is the construction of the highly strained atropTyr C6toTrp N1 
linkage, composed of three amino acid residues, inclucing L
tyrosine, Lproline, and Ltryptophan. Recently, we reported the 
total synthesis of cihunamide B, which features a highly strained 
atropTrpTrp linkage.6 In this synthesis, the application of an 
SNAr 
reaction 
followed 
by 
atroposelective 
Larock 
macrocyclization enabled the construction of the highly strained 
atropTrpTrp linkage. Hence, we hypothesized that this 
atroposelective Larock macrocyclization could be applied to the 
total synthesis of lapparbin (1).7 
 Additionally, the efficient introduction of biaryl moieties is a 
critical objective in this study.
