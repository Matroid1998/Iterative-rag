Description:
A model polymer system made of short chains in water.

NMRD
has also been successfully used to investigate the surface
reorientational dynamics of fluids nanoconfined in high
surfacearea microporous materials 21, 24, 25, and is
commonly used to study heterogeneous catalytic mate
rials 26 and biomolecules such as proteins 27. When
combined with rheology, NMRD can even provide access
to the response of polymer systems under shear 28. In this article, we evaluate the relevance of generic
CG models for the determination of the NMR relaxation
rate R1 for protons of spin quantum number I  12,
for which the primary relaxation mechanism is dipole
dipole interaction. To do so, a model polymer system
made of short PEG chains in water is used.
