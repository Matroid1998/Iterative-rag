Description:
Compounds with proximal CH positions attractive for transformations and significant in pharmaceutical research due to their pharmacological effects.

Text:
Trialkylamines and their proximal CH positions are attractive loci 
for transformations especially as their privileged representation in 
their alkaloid family. The proclivity towards studying this class of 
compounds, however, is beyond their ubiquity; their relevance 
crosses the borders of natural sciences (Figure 1).1418 Moreover, 
rapid synthetic access to structurallydiverse trialkylamines is 
desired in pharmaceutical research as their minute structural 
variations carry substantial pharmacological effects, for instance, 
in the pharmacological activity of opiates.1921 However, aside 
from the intrinsic basicity of amines, their C(sp3)H positions are 
relatively inert.

Description:
Complex substrates for which strategies are scarce.

Text:
Thus, access to derivatives are typically carried out 
via a stepwise fashion usually requiring initial demethylations of 
trialkylamine NCH3 groups to via free NH for subsequent 
transformations.2228 That is until the renaissance of single 
electron transfer (SET) redox methods, partly driven by 
photoredox catalysis, which revolutionized the practice of organic 
chemistry29 allowing direct CC bond formations or nucleophilic 
additions to benzylic amines and a few examples on simple 
aliphatic amines.3036 Still, reports on strategies for LSF of complex 
substrates  especially trialkylamines  are rather scarce.37
