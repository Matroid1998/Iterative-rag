Description:
Can shift the scattering frequency, change the scattering intensity, or modify the population lifetime when added to alkyne systems.

There are also possible effects arising from covalently 
bonded substituents; some experiments have shown that electronic conjugation of the alkyne 
triple bond or adding sulfur or silicon atoms can shift the scatting frequency, change the scattering 
intensity, or modify the population lifetime.31,36,38,4247 
In this paper, we take our first steps towards a full quantum chemistry and molecular 
dynamics investigation of what the alkyne vibration is specifically reporting on. Here, we develop 
a new method for calculating the frequency of a terminal alkyne which is compatible with 
snapshots extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. Our goals are to 
1. Demonstrate that an isolated and localized discrete variable representation method is 
sufficient to compute the terminal alkyne CCstretch normal mode vibrational frequency 
with good accuracy. 2.
