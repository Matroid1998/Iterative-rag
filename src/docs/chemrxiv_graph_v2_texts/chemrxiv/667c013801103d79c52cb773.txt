Description:
Forms solid solutions with ZnO with a limiting concentration of x 0.6.

Thus, the most thermally stable (up to 1100 K) and the widest in concentration (up to x  0.8) are 
solid solutions of ZnO with nickel and magnesium oxides 6,8. For other 3d transition elements 
such as iron, cobalt, and manganese, only the limiting concentrations of x  0.6, 0.5, and 0.4, 
respectively, can be achieved 6,8. Various reasons have been proposed to explain the kinetic 
stability of such metastable solutions. At present, the concept of high entropy oxides in complex systems consisting of 4, 5 or even more 
components (cations) is well known 15.
