Description:
Used as active triggers in signal-amplified responsive synthetic materials.

Text:
Traditionally, chemosensors allow for sensitive detection by amplification of a 
reporter signal via a signal detection event, which is frequently coupled with 
photoluminescence or colorimetry to obtain an optical readout.3 A variety of chemical signals 
have been used as active triggers to initiate the selfpropagating amplification reaction on 
reagents, including hydrogen peroxide7, thiols6,17 and fluoride5,1821, amongst others4,8,22. So far, studies on signalamplified responsive synthetic materials using small molecule 
reagents23,24 or selfimmolative polymers2527 have been limited due to their challenging 
synthetic procedures to access reagents or polymers, and issues with background 
interference.3,10,28 An alternative approach to achieve bioinspired amplified response in 
synthetic soft materials is the mercaptoethanol (BME) or dithiothreitol (DTT)mediated 
amplification cascade based on Meldrums acid conjugated polymeric materials15,28.
