Description:
A promising energy vector that could replace liquid fuels in modern technologies.

Text:
Indeed, by utilization of existing CO2 for the generation of liquid fuels, the 
carbon footprint could be significantly reduced. Methanol is thereby one of the most promising energy 
vectors, since it could replace liquid fuels in modern technologies.4 
In the past years, several reports based on the reduction of CO2 through various transition metal 
compounds,612 metalfree catalysts1318 or direct reduction with NaBH4 without catalysts19 have been 
published. But it is still a problem to capture the CO2 present in the atmosphere, due to its low 
concentration, and furthermore, to reduce it to obtain fuels under ambient conditions.
