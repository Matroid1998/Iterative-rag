Description:
A site in Pb10(PO4)6O where Cu substitution may lead to superconductivity.

The
specific arrangements of atoms with types of orbitals
symmetry can, however, lead to either the swave or
dwave pairing mechanism. Further research is crucial
to investigate and understand the complex structure
property relationships in LK99 compounds. The variety of dopinginduced changes in structures
such as bond lengths, phase transitions with strain
could be an important factor to induce phononmediated
superconductivity. Very recently, it was hypothesized
that the roomtemperature superconductivity in Cu
substituted Pb10(PO4)6O materials could possibly be
caused by two factors a slight volume shrinkage by 0.5
 1 and an insulatormetal transition induced by Cu
substitution on a Pb site and the onsite strong Coulomb
interaction 4.
