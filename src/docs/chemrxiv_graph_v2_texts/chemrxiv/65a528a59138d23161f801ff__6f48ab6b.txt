Description:
Labelling assumed to induce fluorescence enhancement similar to cell surface viscosity effects.

Text:
We show that the dyes, when rendered cell 
impermeable by attachment to triaspartate peptides and attached to cell surface sialic acids through 
acylhydrazone ligation, enable rapid fluorescence microscopic imaging of the cell surface. Of note, this 
property is common also to thiazole orange (TO) previously not considered as a cell surface stain. TO is 
virtually nonfluorescent in free form but experiences dramatic fluorescence enhancements upon DNA 
intercalation because rotations around a central methine bridge are hindered.1315 TO dyes are therefore 
frequently used as nucleic stains.16 In addition, TO has been used to sense the vicinity of proteins that 
hinder twisting.17 Assuming that glycan labelling and cell surface viscosity would induce a similar effect, 
we repurposed TO to enable staining of the cell surface.
