Description:
Involved in the cyclic degradation of SnPSCs leading to a p-type perovskite layer.

Text:
Sn(II) is more susceptible to oxidation 
than Pb(II), as the valence electrons of Sn experience lower effective nuclear charge than those of its 
heavier congener. In addition to the energetic driving force for this oxidation, Lanzetta et al. demonstrated the significance of I2 generation in SnPSCs, which leads to a cyclic degradation with 
detrimental selfdoping resulting in a ptype perovskite layer.6 These fundamental studies of the 
degradation of the active layer have thus far proved useful in designing a road map for mitigating 
oxidation. Use of additives and compositional engineering is a common strategy to inhibit Sn 
oxidation in PSCs.710 For example, addition of small amounts of SnF2, Sn metal and NH4SCN which 
can act as reducing agents without fundamentally changing the perovskite morphology.
