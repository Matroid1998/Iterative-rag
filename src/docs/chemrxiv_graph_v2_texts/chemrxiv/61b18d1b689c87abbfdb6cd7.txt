Description:
Prepared and reported as a product in the described synthesis.

Text:
Phenoxy ringsubstituted phenylcyanoacrylates served as multipurpose screening 
compounds 1, as products of microwaveassisted Knoevenagel condensation of ethyl 

2 

cyanoacetate with aromatic aldehydes in aqueous triazinebased microporous network 2, 
in simple, efficient, and green method for synthesis of trisubstituted electrophilic alkenes 
using Lipase as a Biocatalyst 3, imidazolium chloride immobilized SBA15 as a 
heterogenized organocatalyst for solvent free Knoevenagel condensation using microwave 
4. Preparation of ethyl 3(4benzyloxyphenyl)2cyanoacrylate was reported 5. This 
cyanoacrylate was also described in synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular 
modeling studies of arylidenethiazolidinediones with potential hypoglycemic and 
hypolipidemic activities 6 as well as in its synthesis as analytically pure compounds in 
flow reactors 7, 8.
