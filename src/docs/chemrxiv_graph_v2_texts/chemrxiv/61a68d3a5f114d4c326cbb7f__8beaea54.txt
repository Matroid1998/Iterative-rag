Description:
Used as a linker in constructing Ni-based metal-organic nanosheets.

An emerging class of materials beginning to find unique uses in electrochemical systems is 
organicinorganic hybris systems such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), covalentorganic 
frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives.5 A particular advantage that they hold is their 
molecularly welldefined catalytic sites and modular structure that could enable the extraction of 
discreet structureactivity relationships. As such, only few metalorganic structures have been 
applied for H2O2 synthesis.6 In this work, we build on these previous studies and study the 
effects of linker identity on Nibased metalorganic nanosheets (MONs). We construct MONs 
using terephthalic acid and several derivatives and characterize the resulting materials physical 
and electronic structure with an array of techniques (Fig. 1).
