Description:
A greenhouse gas primarily responsible for the rise in global temperature.

Text:
Human activity is significantly affecting the Earths climate, resulting in 1.18C rise in global 
temperature since preindustrial periods, primarily caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 1. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasizes the necessity of limiting 
global warming within the range of 1.5C to 2.0C in order to avoid irreversible consequences 2. The current annual global CO2 emissions exceed 36 gigatons, and if they continue to increase, 
reaching the climate goals will be impossible 36. Several technological solutions are being 
investigated to reduce the global CO2 emissions, such as decarbonization technologies that aim 
to decrease the emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources and enhancing energy 
efficiency 4.
