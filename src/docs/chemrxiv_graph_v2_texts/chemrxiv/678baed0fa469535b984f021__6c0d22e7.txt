Description:
Surrogates that are typically unstable and lack versatile reactivity compared to difluoroenol silyl ethers.

As a result, only a few exam
ples of radicalbased defluorinative functionalization of trifluo
romethyl ketones have been reported to date.6 
For trifluoromethyl ketones, the most established approach in
volves the generation of difluoroenol silyl ethers, as demon
strated by Uneyama and Amii (Figure 1B).7 In this method, tri
fluoromethyl ketones are treated with magnesium and TMSCl 
to form difluoroenol silyl ethers, which can react at the posi
tion with various electrophiles to produce difluoromethyl com
pounds.8 While effective, this strategy requires the difluoroenol 
silyl ether to be prepared in a separate step, limiting its practical 
application.9 While other difluoroenolate surrogates have been 
reported,10,11 they are typically unstable and cannot be isolated. Furthermore, they lack the versatile reactivity exhibited by 
difluoroenol silyl ethers.

Description:
A surrogate developed from trifluoromethyl ketones as a versatile intermediate.

Moreover, methods for converting 
these intermediates into monofluoromethyl ketones or methyl 
ketones remain unexplored. In this study, we sought to develop a new difluoroenolate sur
rogate, difluoroenol phosphinate from trifluorometylketones, as 
a versatile intermediate (Figure 1C). Phosphine oxides or phos
phites are known to react with electrondeficient ketones via nu
cleophilic attack, followed by a phosphaBrook rearrangement 
to generate stabilized anions.12,13 We hypothesized that apply
ing this chemistry to trifluoromethyl ketones would form such 
anions, which could undergo fluoride elimination prior to pro
tonation, producing difluoroenol phosphinates. These interme
diates are structurally analogous to difluoroenol silyl ethers and 
are anticipated to participate in functionalization reactions.
