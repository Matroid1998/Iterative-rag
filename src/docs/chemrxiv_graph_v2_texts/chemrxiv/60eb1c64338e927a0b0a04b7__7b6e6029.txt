Description:
A 2D material that exhibits a propensity toward oxidation after long-term exposure to air.

Quantum confinement4, 5 of the quasitwodimensional (2D) inorganic slab leads to 
wide band gaps (typically in the range of 34.5 eV), lending these materials potential for 
applications such as white lightemitting diodes.3, 68 Some computational studies have also 
predicted high hole and electron mobilities and efficient excited state photoemission due to 
high exciton binding energies.9, 10 However, like many other 2D materials (e.g., black 
phosphorus, BP, and transition metals dichalcogenides, TMDCs), IIVI LHs also exhibit a 
propensity toward oxidation after longterm exposure to air, which limits their 
(opto)electronic performance as exfoliated fewlayer material.
