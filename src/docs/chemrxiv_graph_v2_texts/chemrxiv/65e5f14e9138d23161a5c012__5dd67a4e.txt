Description:
Clusters that localize LUMO orbitals involved in the photocatalytic activity of MIL125(Ti).

Text:
The photocatalytic 
activity of the MIL125(Ti) is due to a photoinduced electron transfer from the HOMO orbitals of the 
ligand into the LUMO orbitals localized on the Titaniumoxo clusters. The incorporation of amino (
NH2) group in some of the ligand is shifting the absorption wavelength of the MOF to the visible 
spectral range and favour the stabilisation of the electronhole pair, as it has been shown by transient 
UVvis and MidIR femtosecond spectroscopy18,19. For MIL125 derivatives, and MOFs in general, 
understanding the crucial influence on the ligand substituent on the photocatalytic activity18,2024 is of 
great importance to optimize the applications.
