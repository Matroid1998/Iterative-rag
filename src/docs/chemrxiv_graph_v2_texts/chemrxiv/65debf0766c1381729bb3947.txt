Description:
A well-characterized porous material with highly uniform, ordered, and linear pores produced by anodization of aluminum in aqueous acid.

However, little 
work has been done in this direction whereas there are some reports on hydrogels20, 21 and 
nanofibers22, in which intact liposomes were released from hydrogels spontaneously and from 
nanofibers by dissolving polymers constituting the nanofibers. In this study, we focused on porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) as a platform for the 
integration with anionic liposomes. AAO is a wellcharacterized porous material with highly 
uniform, ordered and liner pore produced by anodization of aluminum in aqueous acid
