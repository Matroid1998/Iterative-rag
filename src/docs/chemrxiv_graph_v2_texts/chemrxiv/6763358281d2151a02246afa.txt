paper also highlights the extraction of entkaurenoic acid from sunflowers and describes its syn
thesis toward cafestol in 14 steps. Entkaurenoic acid is a crucial tetracyclic diterpene, 
serving as a precursor for synthesizing numerous ent
kaurenetype diterpenes.1 Among these, cafestol and 
kahweol stand out as entkaurene type diterpene contain
