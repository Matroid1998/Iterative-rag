Description:
A class of crystalline materials with the general formula ABX3, consisting of an organic cation, metal cation, and multidentate inorganic or organic anion.

tetraalkylammonium cations into the Asite reduces the melting temperature, and raises the Tolerance Factor. Total 
scattering methods are used to provide a greater understanding of the melting mechanism. Introduction 
Hybrid organicinorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are a huge class of 
crystalline materials with general formula ABX3, where A, B and X are 
an organic cation, metal cation and multidentate inorganic or organic 
anion, respectively.
