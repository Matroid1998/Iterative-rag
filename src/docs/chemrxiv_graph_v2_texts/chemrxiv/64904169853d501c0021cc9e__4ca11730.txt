Description:
A reactant in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

Text:
In their study, Kaupp et al. documented the first Knoevenagel condensation between 4
nitrobenzaldehyde and malononitrile using a ball mill. They achieved a significant reduction in catalyst concentration 
compared to the traditional solutionbased method.20 These discoveries have led to further studies of solventfree 
Knoevenagel condensation reactions, including 4nitrobenzaldehyde (4NBA) and malononitrile (MN).2227 This 
reaction has been explored in planetary and vibrational ball mills under catalystfree conditions and in the presence 
or absence of solvents, showing complete conversions to the 2(4nitrobenzylidone)malononitrile (2NMN) 
product.25, 28
