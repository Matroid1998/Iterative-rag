Description:
Burned with O2 to generate heat for electricity generation.

Text:
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the reduction of oxygen to water, which releases energy 
that can be used to generate electricity.1 In terms of the efficiency of electricity generation, 
electrochemical fuel cells containing an appropriate catalyst are more efficient than burning H2 
and O2 to generate heat to run a turbine. The best catalysts for ORR contain platinum,1,2 and while 
alternative materials have been considered,35 it has proven quite challenging to optimize the 
efficiency of ORR electrocatalysts.6,7 
In terms only of the efficiency of ORR, articulating the effect of this ideal electrocatalyst on the 
catalytic cycle is easy, but rather difficult to actualize. The ideal electrocatalyst would harvest the 
same amount of energy per electron transferred in each step of the overall electrochemical 
reaction 4H!
