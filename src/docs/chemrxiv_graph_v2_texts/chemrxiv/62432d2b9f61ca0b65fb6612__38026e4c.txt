Description:
A ternary crystalline solid built of SiN4 tetrahedra interconnected via carbon atoms.

Text:
The conducted nanoindentation study revealed a hardness value of 
30 GPa for the crystalline phase and 22 GPa for the amorphous phase, therefore, the authors claim 
that SiCN is a hard material rivaling cubic BN is unjustified. In 1997, Riedel et al. 4 claimed the 
first ternary crystalline solid of the Si2C2N4 stoichiometry built of SiN4 tetrahedra (blue, Fig. 1c) 
interconnected via carbon atoms, thus leading to N3SiNCNSiN3like chains of tetrahedra along 
vertical caxis, corner sharing along horizontal xy planes. This feature is also characteristic of the 
novel SiCN proposed herein except for a mixed NC coordination polyhedron for Si.
