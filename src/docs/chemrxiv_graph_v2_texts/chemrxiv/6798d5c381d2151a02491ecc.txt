Description:
Undergoes methylation in oxic marine waters.

The prevailing scientific consensus agrees on biotic in 
58 
situ Hg methylation 10,11 as the major source of MeHg in oceanic waters, with its distribution often 
59 
closely linked to microbial organic matter degradation 1214. 60 
The importance of anaerobic microorganisms (e.g. sulfatereducing bacteria, ironreducing bacteria, 
61 
methanogenic archaea) in mediating methylation is well known in anoxic environments, with the 
62 
hgcAB genes encoding for Hg methylation 15. Microbes thriving in oxic marine waters bear similar 
63 
Hg transformation genes but their importance in Hg methylation is still debated 1618. Incubation 
64 
experiments evidence the methylation of Hg(II) in oxic marine waters 10,11. The cycling of DMHg in 
65 
seawater is less understood, but it appears to be connected to the formation and decomposition of 
66 
MMHg 10,1922.
