Aim of 
this work fluorobicyclo1.1.1pentanes (FBCPs). Figure 2. Popularity of bicyclo1.1.1pentanes (BCPs) over the 
years. Chemists often incorporate a fluorine atom into organic 
molecules to finetune their physicochemical properties,9 adjust the 
aciditybasicity of the neighboring functional groups,10 and control 
the 
conformation.11 
Given 
the 
high 
popularity 
of 
bicyclo1.1.1pentanes, it is not surprising that chemists also tried 
to selectively decorate them with a fluorine atom. Indeed, 
previously, synthetic approaches the corresponding bridgehead
,12,13 gem14 and polyfluorinated15 derivatives had appeared, and 
these molecules immediately became useful in chemistry. At the 
same time, bicyclo1.1.1pentanes with a single fluorine atom in 
the bridge position have been remaining a dream.
