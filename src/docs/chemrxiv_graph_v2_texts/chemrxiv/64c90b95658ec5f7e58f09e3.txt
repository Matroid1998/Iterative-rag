1.1. Compounded effects of copper pollution 
81 
A trace amount of copper is necessary for life to function, however, due to 
82 
anthropogenic effects; Cu2 levels may exceed the permitted upper regulatory limit of 
83 
0.0015 gL in drinking water and 0.0013 gL in industrial effluents (Bilal et al., 2013). As 
84 
copper has a high affinity for organic matter, it accumulates in sediments (Han et al., 2001; 
85 
Caillat et al., 2013), so it does in biological systems (Salt et al., 1995; Han et al., 2001; van 
86 
Hullebusch et al., 2003; Chibuike and Obiora, 2014; JunFeng et al., 2014; Saadani et al., 
87 
2016; Usman et al., 2019).
