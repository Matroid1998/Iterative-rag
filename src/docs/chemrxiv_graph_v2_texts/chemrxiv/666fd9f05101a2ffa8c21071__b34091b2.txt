Text:
Molybdenum (Mo) plays a central role in a variety of enzymatic 
systems involved in the conversion of small molecules, 
particularly within the ironmolybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) of 
nitrogenases, and within the active site of nitrate reductase, 
formate dehydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, and 
sulfite oxidase enzymes.14 Most of these enzymatic systems 
operate in the higher oxidation states of Mo (IV to VI), and 
the coordination chemistry as well as the corresponding 
reactivities of high oxidation state Mo complexes have been 
extensively studied,513 and applied for the design of bioinspired 
electrocatalysts.14, 15 In this context, the redox noninnocence of 
the molybdopterin ligand plays a key role to stabilize both high 
and lowvalent forms of the complex16 and enable complex, 
multielectron transformations.

Description:
Used in lowvalent compounds for reductive transformations.

Text:
The preparation and reactivity of lowvalent molybdenum 
compounds (III and lower) has been comparatively 
underexplored, despite promising activities in a multitude of 
reductive transformations. Pioneering studies demonstrated the 
ability of tris(amide) supported Mo(III) complexes to promote 
dinitrogen activation and reduction.17,18 Pincer ligands were 
most widely employed for stabilizing lowvalent oxidation 
states of Mo and the corresponding complexes were exploited 
as catalysts for hydrogenation of alkynes19 and nitriles,20 
dinitrogen reduction,2123 olefin isomerization,24 and CO2 
reduction, 25,26 among others. In the context of reactivity with 
CO2, dianionic molybdenum carbonyl (M2Mo(CO)6 (M  Li, 
Na, K)) as well as phosphinesupported complexes (e.g.
