Description:
Central element in triarylboranes where Lewis acidity can be increased by electron-withdrawing groups.

Text:
Triarylboranes have 
garnered the greatest interest owing to their exceptional stability as well as the ability to finetune 
their Lewis acidity by modification of the substituents on the aryl group.8, 9 Electronwithdrawing 
groups such as F, Cl, and CF3 can be installed to increase the Lewis acidity at the boron 
center.1020 The perfluorinated triarylborane, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane B(C6F5)3,20 has found 
the most extensive applications in Lewis acid mediated chemistry, notably in catalysis, olefin 
polymerization, and as the Lewis acid component in frustrated Lewis pairs.9, 
2129 
Fluoroarylboranes with a parafluorine atom can be susceptible to deleterious reactivity via 
nucleophilic substitution at that position that limits their use.30, 31 Beyond fluorinated arene 
substituted boranes, little research has been directed to find new Lewis acids with similar, or better, 
catalytic activity.
