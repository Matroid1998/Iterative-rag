Description:
The multicongurational electronic structure is more nuanced compared to Mo2 and W2 analogues.

The concept of an eective bond order (EBO), that accounts
for partial occupation of lowlying antibonding orbitals, has been used to quantify the nature of
the overall CrCr bond that is composed of multiple partial bonds.19,20 Furthermore, these com
putations highlight that the multicongurational electronic structure of Cr2 bonds is more nuanced
compared to Mo2 and W2 analogues.20 As a result, the CrCr bond order often does not correlate
with bond distance.1922 Note that for some particularly short CrCr distances, density functional
theory (DFT) has been used successfully since the electronic structure can be represented by fully
occupied bonding orbitals.23
The lack of correlation between bond distance and bond order motivated a number of vibra
tional studies of these compounds; diraction studies alone cannot be used to predict bonding or,
in turn, vibrational force constants.
