Description:
Found in green sulphur bacteria as part of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson bacteriochlorophyll complex.

Text:
Research performed with photosynthetic bacteria has found 
strong coupling between the bacteria and photons.7, 8 Bacteria 
placed in an optical cavity results in the formation of new 
eigenstates that are a coherent superposition of photonic and 
excitonic transitions.8 Quantum beats have been observed via 
twodimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) in the Fenna
MatthewsOlson bacteriochlorophyll complex found in green 
sulphur bacteria.7 
It has 
been proposed that artificial LHCs mimic 
photosynthesis.5 Because the development of artificial LHCs has 
been based on those present in nature, inherent similarities 
between these two forms of LHCs exist in photon absorption 
and energy transfer.1, 5, 911 Specifically, the BODIPYbearing 
pillar5arene LHC has been shown to exhibit FRET with 92 
efficiency.5 Timedependent density functional theory (TDDFT) 
has shown electronic coherence in four chemically unique 
BODIPY compounds on the order of femtoseconds.12 
To date, artificial LHCs have not been shown experimentally 
to exhibit quantum coherence.
