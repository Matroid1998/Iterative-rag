Description:
A component of positive electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries, often reduced to lower levels for cost and energy density improvements.

Text:
Understanding the degradation mechanisms for advanced lithiumion battery (LIB) chemistries 
is an essential, and vibrant, area of research to improve electrochemical energy storage 
technology. In pursuit of lower cost and higher energy density cells, positive electrode materials 
with less cobalt and higher specific capacity are being investigated, such as the Nirich (Ni  
60) Li(NiMnCo)O2 cathode (known as NMC). However, LIBs with Nirich cathodes show 
accelerated performance fading compared to their lowerNi analogues.1,2 
Nirich cathode materials have been shown to release lattice oxygen from the surface at lower 
potential,3,4 resulting in structural transformation from the initial layered structure to more 
oxygen deficient spinel andor rock saltlike structures after cycling, termed the reduced
