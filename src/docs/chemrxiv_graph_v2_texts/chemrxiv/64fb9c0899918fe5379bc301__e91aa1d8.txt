Description:
Used as an ion-pairing reagent in acylCoA analysis.

Text:
However, liquid 
61 
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS), is the most widely used technique for 
62 
acylCoA analysis due to its higher sensitivity and selectivity. On the other hand, severe peak 
63 
tailing, signal deterioration, and poor detection limits are common obstacles associated with 
64 
this approach23,24. Various efforts have been made to cover the full range of acylCoA in a 
65 
single analytical run. One such method is to use ionpairing reagents such as triethylamine25 
66 
or dimethylbutyl amine16,26. However, ionpairing reagents are reported to decrease mass 
67 
spectrometry signal intensity27 and frequent cleaning of detectors is required. Another
