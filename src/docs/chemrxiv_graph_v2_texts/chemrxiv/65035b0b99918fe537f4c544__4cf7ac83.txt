Description:
Exists with a valence of 3 in the natural environment.

The maximum contaminant level of Sb in drinking water is set at 6 gL by the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency3, and the average Sb concentration in drinking water near 
the Xikuangshan Sb mine in China was found to be 53.6  4.7 gL.4 Despite Sbs increasing use, 
limited studies exist on its mobility, redox geochemistry, and toxicity. Sb is commonly found as either Sb(V) (5 valence) or Sb(III) (3 valence) in the natural 
environment. Redox reactions can mobilize or immobilize certain potentially toxic metalloids like 
Sb. The redox properties of Sb are a driving factor for many of the reactions this element 
participates in, such as adsorption and dissolution.

Description:
Has the greatest toxicity among antimony species.

Text:
While Sb(V) is more thermodynamically stable 
than Sb(III) in oxic environments, Sb redox reactions in anoxic conditions are lacking 
thermodynamic data.5 Anoxic zones in groundwater aquifers are areas where Sb should be closely 
monitored because the toxicity of Sb is greatest for Sb(III), followed by Sb(V), and least for 
organic antimony species.3 A variety of abiotic chemical species have been shown to reduce Sb(V) 
such as, sulfide, Fe(II) containing minerals, and KI.5 In addition, several studies have demonstrated 
redox transformations by Sbreducing microbiota.68
