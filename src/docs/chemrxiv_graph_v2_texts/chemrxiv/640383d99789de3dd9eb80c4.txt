Description:
A catalytic residue in most tyrosine phosphatases responsible for substrate dephosphorylation.

Text:
Many diseases, including cancers, arise from the 
dysregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, and tyrosine phosphatases have been proposed as candidate drug 
targets for the treatment of these diseases.3 For example, the phosphatase PTP1B has been linked to 
diabetes and obesity, as it acts as a negative regulator of the insulin receptor signaling pathway by 
dephosphorylating the insulin receptor and its substrates.4,5 The phosphatase SHP2 has been shown to 
promote oncogenic signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases.6,7 Both of these enzymes have been 
the targets of extensive preclinical drug discovery campaigns, and allosteric inhibitors of SHP2 are currently 
in clinical trials.8,9 Despite their physiological importance, the regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of 
many PTPs remain poorly defined, in part due to the lack of robust chemical tools to selectively inhibit PTPs 
or monitor their activity in cells.10 
Most tyrosine phosphatases have a catalytic cysteine that is directly responsible for substrate 
dephosphorylation.

Description:
A residue located on the P loop.

Text:
They also have a catalytic arginine on the same loop as the cysteine residue (P loop), as 
well as conserved aspartic acid and glutamine residues on the WPD and Q loops, respectively.

Description:
The catalytic cysteines of most PTPs are susceptible to reversible oxidation by reactive oxygen species.

Text:
These 
residues make up the conserved catalytic core of classical PTPs (Figure 1A,B).11,12 The WPD loop can adopt 
an open or closed conformation that is dependent on substrate or inhibitor binding (Figure 1A, left panel), 
and it has been suggested that this loop plays a regulatory role.1114 In some phosphatases, such as SHP2, 
auxiliary noncatalytic domains physically occlude the active site to regulate activity.1518 Furthermore, the 
catalytic cysteines of most PTPs are susceptible to reversible oxidation by reactiveoxygen species, and 
oxidation has been proposed as a dynamic regulatory mechanism.1921 Other uncharacterized regulatory 
mechanisms likely exist for PTPs, making these enzymes an opportune target class for activitybased 
profiling.22 In this context, it is noteworthy that the catalytic cysteine in PTPs has a characteristically low pKa 
due to the active site environment,23,24 which should make it a good target for covalent probes.

Description:
A residue whose reactivity and ligandability are examined using mass spectrometry proteomics.

Text:
There has been an exciting revolution in chemical biology to examine the proteomewide reactivity 
and ligandability of cysteine residues using mass spectrometry proteomics. These studies have served as a 
starting point for identification of new ligandable protein targets and the development of covalent probes and 
drugs.25,26 Cysteine reactivity across the proteome is generally assessed by measuring labeling efficiency 
with a highly reactive iodoacetamide probe.27,28 Cysteine ligandability, on the other hand, is examined by 
treating the proteome with smallmolecule covalent fragments bearing weaker electrophiles, like 
chloroacetamide or acrylamide, followed by treatment with an iodoacetamide probe.

Description:
Residues that are not very reactive relative to the entire proteome, despite their low pKa values.

Text:
These datasets can be leveraged for the development of 
covalent inhibitors, probes, and degraders for a variety of protein targets, particularly for nonactive site 
cysteine residues.25 However, published proteomewide ligandability screens have not yielded any 
substantial leads for PTP active site cysteine residues.30 Rather, these screens suggest that PTP catalytic 
cysteines are not very reactive relative to the entire proteome, despite their low pKa values,23,24 and they are 
apparently unliganded by most fragments used in existing screens. Consequently, it is difficult to extract 
information from these global ligandability screens on how different structures impact covalent inhibition of 
PTPs. In this study, we have taken a targetcentric approach to identify structural leads for the development 
of covalent PTP inhibitors and probes.
