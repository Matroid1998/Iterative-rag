MoritaBaylisHillman chemistry has received a lot of attention for its capacity to produce 
beneficial outcomes in organic synthesis.1,2 MoritaBaylisHillman (MBH) adducts have been applied 
broadly in multiple synthetic transformations owing to the presence of various functional groups in close 
proximity.3 One offspring of the adduct is the MBH ketone, obtained by the straightforward oxidation of 
the allylic alcohol moiety.4 MBH ketones are 1,1disubstituted olefins having two electronwithdrawing 
groups conjugated to a terminal olefin. Owing to its versatile reactivity, it has been utilized as a crucial 
subject in valuable synthetic applications.5 In continuation of the growth of this topic of study. Our research 
group has also investigated MBH ketones to build various significant scaffolds.
