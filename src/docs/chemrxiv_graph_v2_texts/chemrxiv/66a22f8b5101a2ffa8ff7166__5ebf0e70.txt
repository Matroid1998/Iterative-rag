electrons in RE elements play a key role in increasing the refractive index of optical glasses;
34
furthermore, REdoped opticalamplication bers and lowloss optical bers are currently
35
being researched for new applications in advanced optical communication. 13,1518 Trivalent
36
RE elements can also be generated as ssion products of nuclear fuel, and they are found
37
in spent nuclear fuel.19,20 Because nuclear waste is mixed and solidied into borosilicate
38
glass for its nal disposal, it is essential to understand the nature of borate glass containing
39
trivalent REs to gain a fundamental understanding of nuclearwaste immobilization. 19,2123

Binary xLa2O3(1 x)B2O3 glass systems have been studied in a wide composition

range.
