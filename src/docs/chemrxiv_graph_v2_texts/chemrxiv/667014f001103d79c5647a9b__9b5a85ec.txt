Ligands that can be substituted to improve catalyst performance.

GruI, Figure 1) enabled the widespread use of olefin metathesis in the academy.4 In subsequent 
years, ruthenium catalysts underwent a series of diverse modifications. Substitution of one of the 
phosphines with an Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand yielded a noticeable enhancement in activity 
(GruII, Figure 1),5 while the replacement of ordinary styrene with isopropoxystyrene increased the 
stability of the catalyst (HovII, Figure 1).6 In 2011, Grubbs developed the first Zselective ruthenium 
catalysts bearing an adamantyl group (Ru1, Ru2, Figure 1).7 Further contributions were made by 
Jensen (Ru3, Figure 1), who developed complexes with 2,4,6triphenylbenzenethiolate ligand,8 as well 
as by Schrock and Hoveyda introducing a series of molybdenum complexes (e.g.
