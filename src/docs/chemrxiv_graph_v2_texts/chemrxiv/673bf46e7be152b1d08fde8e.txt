More than 940 million people do not have access to electricity globally. The situation is even worse in 
countries like South Sudan, as only 7 of their population can access electricity. Unfortunately, our cur
rent energy demands dont seem to be going down anytime soon, as our energy demands continue to 
increase exponentially.1 The need for a new energy storage source that is secure, efficient, and environ

human health and the planet.2
