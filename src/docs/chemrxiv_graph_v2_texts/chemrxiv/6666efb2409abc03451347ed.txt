Description:
A wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct band gap of 3.35 eV and large exciton binding energy of 60 meV.

Text:
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a
direct band gap (3.35 eV), large exciton binding energy of 60
meV, which can be doped to show a resistivity of 4.4103
 cm at room temperature. (13) These properties make it
of interest as a potential material for applications in gas sen
sors (4), transistors (5), LEDs (6), photocatalysis (7), ultra
violet lasers (8) and also in solar energy conversion (9). The
controlled derivation of nanoscale shapes and different mor
phologies is of great interest because of the possibility of
tuning the physicochemical properties of these materials re
lated to their surface properties and states. ZnO nanostruc
tures can be synthesized in a number of ways.

Description:
Nanostructured material obtained by wet methods such as sonochemical, solgel, solvo or hydrothermal, and organometallic approaches.

Text:
Based on the
most commonly used approaches we can propose the divi
sion to vacuum and chemical methods, both of which have
their own advantages and yield different properties of the
materials. (2, 1012) The chemical methods focus mainly on
obtaining nanostructured ZnO by wet methods such us sono
chemical (13), solgel (14), solvo or hydrothermal (15) or
organometallic approaches (16, 17), etc, leading to the for
mation of nanostructures and nanoparticles. Vacuum methods
focus more on thin, uniformly dense films grown by means
of atomic layer deposition (18) or epitaxial techniques (19),
pulsed laser deposition (20) or magnetron sputtering (21). The magnetron sputtering technique is the one which is the
least costintensive of the vacuumbased ones.
