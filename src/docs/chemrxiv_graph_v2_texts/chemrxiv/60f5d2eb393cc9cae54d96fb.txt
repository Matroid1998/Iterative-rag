Description:
Heavy metals relevant to nuclear energy technologies.

Text:
Solvent extraction, also known as liquidliquid extraction (LLE),
is one of the most industrially prevalent methods for the sepa
ration and purication of complex metal mixtures  whether in
ore renement, recycling, or environmental remediation. It is
a particularly relevant technology for the separation of heavy
metals, including actinides and rare earths, that are relevant to
nuclear energy technologies.13 LLE involves the partitioning of
metal ions between the aqueous and organic phases and often
involves the use of a chelating amphiphilic extractant that binds
the hydrated metal ion at the wateroil interface to create a hy
drophobic species that migrates from the interface into the or
ganic phase.
