Description:
Used for gas separation applications.

Text:
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), owing to their fascinating properties such as structural and 
functional diversity, tunable pore size, and enormous surface area, have tremendous applications 
in gas storage1, molecular separation2, sensors3, and catalysis.4 Though zeolites, covalent organic 
frameworks, and complex hydrides are available for gas separation applications5, MOF based 
separative systems have attracted wide attention due to their high selectivity as a result of their 
extensive chemical diversity and porous nature in comparison to other classical adsorbate 
systems.6 The microporous nature of the MOFs enables systematic immobilization of the 
functional materials and are envisaged as a practical promise for gas purification and separation 
applications at an industrial scale.
