Description:
A ligand used to stabilize the (HMPA)3Sc3O2 complex.

Text:
For 
example, Fukuzumi24 recorded the EPR spectrum of 
the (HMPA)3Sc3O2 complex stabilised by three 
equivalents of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) 
ligand, formed via PET from the singlet excited state 
of 
1benzyl1,4dihydronicotinamide 
dimer 
1(BNA)2, to O2. This procedure was accompanied 
by fast cleavage of the CC bond in the formed 
(BNA)2 (Fig. 1d, bottom part). Our present study is the first report to demonstrate 
the 
activity 
of 
Sc(OTf)3 
functioning 
as 
a sole photoredox catalyst. Sc(OTf)3 is shown to 
facilitate aerobic oxidation of a benzylic CH bond 
and direct oxidative cyanation of arenes as examples 
of CH activation and CC coupling reactions (Fig. 1e).
