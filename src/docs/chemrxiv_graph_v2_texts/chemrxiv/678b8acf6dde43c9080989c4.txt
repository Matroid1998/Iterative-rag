Description:
Optimal concentration range for seed germination is between 30 and 70 mmolL1, with deviations hindering germination.

Nonbiological stressors such as drought 45, salinity 6, extreme temperature
78, light variations 9, waterlogging 10, mechanical forces 11, and chemical
disturbances (like heavy metals or pesticide residues), as well as biological stressors,
can cause ROS accumulation at this stage 12. A moderate amount of ROS can
activate gene expression, helping plants adapt to adverse conditions. However, if ROS
level exceeds the optimal threshold, oxidative stress occurs, causing cellular damage
that can delay or even prevent seed germination. For example, in Artemisia
sphaerocephala seeds, the optimal range for H2O2 concentration is between 30 and 70
mmolL1 1314. Concentrations out of this range can significantly hinder seed
germination. Therefore, monitoring ROS levels during the early stage of seed
germination is crucial for selecting suitable varieties under nonbiological stress
conditions.
