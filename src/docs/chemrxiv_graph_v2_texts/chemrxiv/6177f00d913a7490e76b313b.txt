Description:
A larger atom used to replace furanose oxygen to explore changes in ring conformation and hydrolytic stability.

Text:
Bioisosteric replacement of furanose oxygen with larger sulfur seeks to explore the biological effect, 
imparted through changes to furanose ring conformation and the hydrolytic stability of a 
thiohemiaminal glycosidic linkage.
