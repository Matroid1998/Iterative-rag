Description:
A catalyst that boosts the yield of reactions involving nitromethane.

Text:
of the amino acid catalyst and nitromethane substrate boosts the yield to 71 with near
quantitative conversion. Taken together, this work shows that biocatalysed oxidation can 
be coupled to multistep catalytic cascades to expand the types of products available from 
bioprocesses. OH
