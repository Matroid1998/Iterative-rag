Ubiquitous aromatic feedstocks important in drug development and organic reactions.

In turn, straightforward access to privileged 3D chemical space using 
ubiquitous aromatic feedstocks is of prime importance, as their integra
tion into the complex organic framework holds extensive value in drug 
development (Figure 1A) and finds application in a multitude of or
ganic reactions.12, 13 The dearomative selective reduction of (het
ero)arenes1219 and reductive deuteration,20 especially nitrogenous het
erocyclic compounds represent the shortest way to leverage the con
struction of saturated nitrogencontaining heterocycles (cyclic 
amines),16, 18, 21, 22 which are advanced chemical building blocks ena
bling their exploration for targeted therapies.16 For instance, substi
tuted 1,2,3,4tetrahydroquinolines, piperidines, piperazines, indolines, 
pyrrolidines, and related ring systems are integral parts of 3Dpharma
cophores, orally bioavailable drugs, as well as bioactive natural prod
ucts (Figure 1B).2327 However, generating saturated Nheterocyclic 
analogues can be a substantial synthetic burden and laborintensive.16, 
18 Therefore, the expansion of robust methodologies is necessary not 
only to access nitrogenbased 3Dlike sp3rich fragments for efficient 
clinical research but also to search for innovative pharmaceutical com
pounds with enhanced therapeutic efficiency.
