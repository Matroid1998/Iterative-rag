Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding, a dominant interaction controlling structure and reactivity of proteins.

Text:
of the first amino group to the secondary coordination sphere has the largest stabilization 
effect; more amino groups do not change the results significantly. The amino group can transfer a hydrogen atom to the 
peroxo ligands which results in the OO bond cleavage. This process is thermodynamically favored over the O2 elimination, 
but entropically disfavored. Introduction 
Hydrogen bonding is one of the dominant interactions 
which Nature uses to control structure and reactivity of pro
teins. Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in binding 
and activating of molecular oxygen.

Description:
Involved in complex dynamic behavior of hydrogen bonds in enzymes.

On one hand, it helps to 
stabilize the dioxygen (O2) binding to irondependent pro
teins like hemoglobin and myoglobin.1 On the other hand, it 
helps to drive the reactivity in O2 utilizing enzymes like ox
idases and oxygenases.2 However, the exact molecular de
tails of hydrogenbonding assistance are difficult to study 
due to the complex dynamic behavior of the hydrogen 
bonds in the enzymes.3 
An elegant example for investigating the effect of the hy
drogen bonding on the metaldioxygen stabilization was re
ported previously by the group of Masuda.4 In their re
search, they studied the effect of the hydrogen bonding on 
peroxo dinuclear copper(II) complexes.
