Description:
Forms part of amphiphilic triblock copolymers with hydrophilic properties.

However, the actual situation 
may be more complex as recently shown for a variety of drug 
loaded micelles, as the nature of the hydrophobic block can signif
icantly affect the drug loading.5, 6 A particularly strong effect was 
reported for the different solubilization behaviors of structurally 
very similar poly(2oxazoline) (POx) and poly(2oxazine) (POzi) 
based drug delivery vehicles (Scheme 1). Scheme 1 A) Schematic synthesis of the structural isomers poly(2oxazo

polymerization (LCROP) of 2substituted 2oxazolines and 2substituted 2
oxazines; B) Schematic representation of the amphiphilic triblock copoly
