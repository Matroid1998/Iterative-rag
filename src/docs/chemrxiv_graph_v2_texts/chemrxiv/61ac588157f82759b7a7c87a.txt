Description:
Functionalization at nitrogen generates pyridinium cations.

Text:
Typically, functionalization at nitrogen to generate 
pyridinium cations, makes pyridine ring favorable for 
electrophilic andor nucleophilic substitution. Very recently, 
we reported a Knoevenagel condensation at the three methyl 
carbons in one pyridine promoted upon quaternization, leading 
to the formation of several pyridiniumcored vinylenelinked 
COFs with high crystallinities and quite large surface areas, 
suggesting an excellent efficiency in the activation of a multi
topic monomer22. Nacyl pyridinium has been found as a highly 
active intermediate formed in the process of pyridinecatalyzed 
hydrolysis of acid anhydride, or as one type of efficient 
acylation reagent from the treatment of pyridine with an acyl 
donor2324.
