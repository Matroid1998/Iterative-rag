Description:
An atom adjacent to which CH bond functionalization occurs in the Shono oxidation.

In the past decade, electroor
ganic synthesis has attracted significant attention because it 
allows, in principle, straightforward and accurate control 
over the redox transformations of a substrate by selecting 
the proper electrode potentials.15 However, when the redox 
reactions of organic substrates directly occur on an elec
trode surface (i.e., direct electrolysis), a large overpotential 
is often required to initiate such a heterogeneous electron 
transfer process, prone to cause uncontrolled multielectron 
oxidation or reduction of the substrate.6 For example, the 
Shono oxidation is a classical electrochemical reaction for 
functionalizing a CH bond adjacent to a nitrogen atom.7 In 
this transformation, amine substrate I is oxidized by two 
electrons to Nacyliminium cation species II, later trapped 
by nucleophiles such as MeOH and H2O (Figure 1A).
