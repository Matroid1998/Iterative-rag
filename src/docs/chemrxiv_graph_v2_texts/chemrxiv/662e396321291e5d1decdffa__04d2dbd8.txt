Arguably, a more promising approach involves converting 
CO2 into diverse C1 building blocks like methane or carbon monoxide.18 Particularly, carbon monoxide 
serves as an activated C1 building block with abundant associated chemistry. Reduction of CO2 can be 
achieved through hydrogenation reactions, such as the Sabatier reaction and reverse water gas shift 
(RWGS) reaction. These reactions have also been investigated as lightassisted processes in 
photochemical or photothermal systems,1921 thereby lowering energy consumption and enhancing 
sustainability.2224 
To date, significant strides have been made in the development and evaluation of catalysts and reactor 
systems for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide.2533 However, direct comparison of the performance 
and efficacy of these catalysts remains challenging due to the absence of standardized operational 
procedures.

The 
precise control and modularity of this system facilitate the continuous lightassisted production of 
carbon dioxide hydrogenation products, which can be seamlessly integrated into downstream units. In 
this study, we leverage the generated carbon monoxide as a reagent in a diverse array of palladium
