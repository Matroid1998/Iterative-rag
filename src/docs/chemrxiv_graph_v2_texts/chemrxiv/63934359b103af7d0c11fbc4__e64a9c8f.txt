Description:
Converted to cationic alkylcobalt(IV) complexes via carbon radicals.

Text:
The recent trends in drug discovery encouraged us to develop 
a simple and general synthetic method for fourmembered het
erocycles by harnessing the metal hydride hydrogen atom trans
fer (MHAT)14radical polar crossover (RPC) reaction (Figure 
1c). This catalytic process is realized by the combination of a 
cobalt catalyst, an oxidant, and a silyl hydride that generates key 
cobalt hydride and a highly reactive carbocationic intermediate 
(cationic alkylcobalt(IV) complexes) from alkenes via carbon 
radicals under nearneutral conditions.
