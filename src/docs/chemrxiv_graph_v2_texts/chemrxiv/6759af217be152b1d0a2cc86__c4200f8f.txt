Description:
Employed as a nonporous metallic counter electrode to suppress competing processes in supercapacitors.

However, our groups recent mechanistic studies on SSA suggested that there are competing 
CO2 capture and release processes at the two electrodes in supercapacitors, with the competition becoming 
apparent at slow charging conditions or during long voltage holds (15, 22). Specifically, we proposed that CO2 
capture at the gasexposed carbon electrode is accompanied by CO2 release at the electrolyteimmersed carbon 
electrode, reducing the overall CO2 adsorption capacities of the device (22). In pursuit of enhanced CO2 capture 
performance, strategies to reduce the competing processes are needed. Here we therefore employed nonporous metallic zinc as the electrolyteimmersed counter electrode to 
break the supercapacitor symmetry (Fig. 1B) and to suppress the competing processes in conventional 
symmetric supercapacitors.
