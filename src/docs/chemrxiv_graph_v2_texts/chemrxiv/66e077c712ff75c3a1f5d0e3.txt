Description:
Thinfilms used in photovoltaic research with high sensitivity and complexity.

Text:
With the needed thinfilm PV research boom 
has come frequent reporting of champion devices, without verified reproducibility or 
comprehensive protocols. Systemic study of these properties in conjunction with thinfilm PV 
development, particularly for metal halide perovskite thinfilms, may provide insight into 
mechanisms of improvement. Prior work has attributed the challenges in replicability with the high 
sensitivity and complexity of PV materials coupled with incomplete procedure reporting.6 When 
experimental procedures consistently cannot be effectively transferred between two domain 
experts, the efficacy of peerreviewed, literaturedriven communication comes into question. A 
lack of control at the labscale makes functional application highly challenging when the target 
goal is effective scale up and rollout.
