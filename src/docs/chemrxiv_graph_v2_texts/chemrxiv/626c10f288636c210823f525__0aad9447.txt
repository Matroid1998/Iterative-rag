Description:
Used in the synthesis of porous materials such as carbon nanomaterials.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous organic polymers 17. They comprise 
lightweight elements (e.g., C, B, and N) linked via covalent bonds. They exhibited several 
advantages, including high chemical and thermal stability, high porosity, and low density 2,4,8
10. Thus, they improved the performance for several applications such as gas adsorption or 
separation and catalysis 1113. COFs offer the potential to use as support and precursors for the 
synthesis of porous materials such as carbon nanomaterials 1417. Organic reactions via carboncarbon (CC) coupling are an important industrial method for 
synthesizing pharmaceuticals, drugs, and conjugated polymers 1820. The 2010 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry was awarded to scientists Heck, Negishi, and Suzuki for developing palladium (Pd)
catalyzed CC crosscoupling reaction 2123.
