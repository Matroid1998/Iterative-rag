Description:
A nonclassical carbocation formed upon solvolysis of cyclobutyl derivatives.

Small organic rings are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis, as their inherent 
strain can facilitate reactions that would not otherwise be possible. Control over the siteselectivity of 
reaction on small rings is typically explained by the release of ring strain or by steric effects, but this 
predictability can break down under cationic reaction conditions where the reaction pathway involves the 
formation of nonclassical carbocation intermediates.1 Nonclassical carbocations (Fig. 1a) have long 
fascinated the chemical community, as their characterisation is highly challenging, and they have the 
ability to form multiple products. Among the most notable of these species are the cyclopropylcarbinyl 
(CC) and bicyclobutonium (BB) cations (Fig. 1a)  two closely related structures of formula C4H7  
which form upon solvolysis of cyclobutyl and cylopropylmethyl derivatives.
