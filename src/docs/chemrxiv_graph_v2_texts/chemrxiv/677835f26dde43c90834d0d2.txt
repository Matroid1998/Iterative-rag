Unique for its high nucleophilicity and oxidation susceptibility in proteins.

Text:
Cysteine in proteins is unique for its high nucleophilicity and oxidation
susceptibility.1, 2 These features render protein cysteines to exert distinct biological 
functions, such as redox sensing.1, 3 Cysteine oxidations occur in response to diverse 
biological, medical, and environmental factors, including growth factors and cytokines,46 
reactive oxygen species (ROS),7 nutrients,810 chemotherapy,11, 12 radiation,13 and 
metals,14, 15 suggesting their prevalence and significance in biology and medicine.

Description:
Forms diverse oxoforms including S-sulfenylation, disulfide formation, S-glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation.

Text:
The 
complexity of cysteine oxidations is that cysteine forms diverse oxoforms, including S
sulfenylation, disulfide formation, Sglutathionylation, and Snitrosylation, which retain 
unique structures and chemical reactivity.3 Although different cysteine oxoforms could 
cause similar functional outcomes (e.g., inhibiting enzyme activity), evidence supports 
that individual cysteine oxidations occur on distinct sets of proteins and regulate different 
biological pathways and processes,16 warranting investigation of individual cysteine 
oxidations. Protein Sglutathionylation is one of the main cysteine oxidations and represents 
protein cysteine disulfide bond formation with intracellular glutathione.17 The significance 
of protein Sglutathionylation has been demonstrated with its regulatory or contributing 
roles in physiology and pathology,17, 
18 including proliferation, migration,4, 
19 
inflammation,20 fibrosis,21 the cardiovascular system,22, 23 neurodegeneration,24 and 
cancers,25 among others.

Description:
A site susceptible to S-glutathionylation identified via proteomics.

Text:
It is notable that the development of biochemical tools and 
strategies, especially in conjugation with proteomics and mass spectrometry, enabled the 
identification of a large number of proteins and cysteines (n2,000) susceptible to S
glutathionylation.17 The cysteine sites identified via proteomics serve as important
