Description:
A substrate for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, activated by ligand-gated conformational changes.

In particular, understanding the dynamical behavior of decorating loops that cover 
enzyme active sites is important as such loops can regulate substrate selectivity, the evolution of 
new activities, and potentially also turnover rates.3, 1832 As such, targeting the dynamics of such 
active site loops is attractive from an engineering perspective,16, 33 and therefore there is substantial 
interest in understanding loop dynamics and its impact on selectivity and catalysis. In this context, there have been extensive studies of a widerange of enzymes, such as 
triosephosphate isomerase (TPI),34, 35 orotidine 5monophosphate decarboxylase, (OMPDC)36 
glycerol 
3phosphate 
dehydrogenase 
(GPDH),37, 
38 
1deoxyDxylulose5phosphate 
reductoisomerase,39, 40 and phosphoglucomutase,41 which have been demonstrated to be 
activated by ligandgated conformational changes.
