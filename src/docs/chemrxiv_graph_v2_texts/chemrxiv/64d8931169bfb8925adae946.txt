Description:
An element used for doping in mineral structures to study changes in electronic properties.

Text:
Several other manuscripts on theoretical explanation, based on computational modeling, also 
appeared. They were focused on the application of density functional theory method to periodic 
structure of the lead apatite and its doping with copper and followed the changes in the electronic
