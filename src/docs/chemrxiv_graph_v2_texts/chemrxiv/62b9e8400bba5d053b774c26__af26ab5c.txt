Description:
Used in metal anodes for All-Solid-State Batteries due to its potential to prevent dendrite formation.

Text:
Liion batteries (LIBs) constitute a technological breakthrough with a largescale impact on our 
societies.1 The current state of the art LIB is highly optimized and its density is close to the theoretical 
one, however, a next generation battery with higher capabilities can constitute a step further towards 
decreasing the reliance on fossil fuels. AllSolidState Battery (ASSB) resembles a potential candidate 
for the upcoming energy storage devices. ASSBs may not just be superior with larger energy density 
and power performance because it also hinders (theoretically) dendrite formation giving the possibility 
of using Li metal anodes. They also provide higher safety aspects since the inflammable carbonate
based liquid electrolyte is not used.
