Description:
A good active material for Li-ion anodes with a superior theoretical capacity.

Text:
However, while lithiumgraphite 
intercalates are safer and more stable they have only a tenth of 
the energy density of metallic lithium.2 Silicon is a good active 
material for Liion anodes because it has a superior theoretical 
capacity of 3579 mA h g1 (or 8340 mA h cm3) for Li15Si4, and  
unlike some transition metals  it is not toxic and abundant.

Description:
Can store a large number of lithium atoms, inducing large volume changes during charge-discharge cycles.

Text:
Moreover, its alloying reaction with lithium triggered at 0.3 V vs. 
LiLi, prevents the formation of metallic lithium around the anode 
during discharging  a detrimental process observed for Li
graphite batteries known as lithium plating  and allows the use 
of SiLi electrodes under harsher conditions.3 The large number 
of lithium atoms that silicon can store, however, induces large 
volume changes during chargedischarge cycles (300).3 The 
mechanical stress induced by these drastic volume changes 
leads to the pulverization of the silicon active material, loss of 
contact of the electrode film with the current collector, and loss of 
overall mechanical integrity of the whole electrode. Repeated 
cycles of expansion and contraction of silicon expose pristine 
silicon surfaces and induce the reformation of solid electrolyte 
interfaces (SEI).

Description:
Forms hierarchical, nanosized, or porous structures to buffer volume expansion during lithiation.

Text:
This process contributes to the gradual 
consumption of lithium and electrolyte, and it limits the diffusion of 
charge carriers through the expanding SEI.34 It is difficult to 
counter these detrimental mechanical and chemical changes to 
siliconbased electrodes because conventional methods of 
electrode assembly rely on the mixing of multiple components that 
are held together by weak, dispersive forces. In laboratory settings, some strategies were developed to address 
the inherent flaws of these multicomponent assemblies. For 
example, shaping silicon into hierarchical, nanosized, or porous 
structures buffers some of its dramatic volume expansion during 
lithiation.4d On the downside, nanostructured silicon is 
susceptible to restructuring during battery operation, and its larger 
specific surface promotes reactions with the electrolyte to form 
more of electrochemically inactive SEI.
