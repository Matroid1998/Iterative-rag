dyes, radioactive labels and antibiotics), to image and treat infections.7, 8 A key nutrient of 
prokaryotes is iron, which fulfills numerous enzymatic und metabolic functions, enabling 
bacterial growth and pathogenicity. Bacteria evade iron limitation in the host organism through 
the import of heme and ferric iron.

Description:
A metal that is sequestered by siderophores for transport.

Text:
In the latter case this implies the synthesis and secretion of 
small, organic iron chelators, socalled siderophores (Greek for iron carriers).9 After iron 
sequestration from host proteins, the ferric siderophore complexes are recaptured via specific 
outer membrane transporters called TonBdependent transporters (TBDTs).10 Ferric 
siderophores constitute cargo for TBDTs, but also other nutrients like heme, carbohydrates, 
nickel complexes and vitamin B12 are transported by TBDTs.11 Interestingly, TBDTs have also 
been parasitized by bacteriophages and colicins to board the bacterial cell.12 These 
transporters are unique to prokaryotes and present an unparalleled gateway to shuttle 
antibiotics inside bacterial pathogens.13 This was demonstrated by the recently approved 
siderophorecephalosporin antibiotic cefiderocol (Fetroja).14 The ability to transport even 
large cargo into bacteria is best illustrated by microcin MccE492, a natural product that consists 
of an 84 aa peptide chain attached via a sugar linkage to a triscatecholate chelator originating 
from enterobactin.15 MccE492 exerts its antimicrobial effect at the cytoplasmic membrane after 
import.

Description:
An essential element that prokaryotes acquire using siderophores.

Text:
The application of natural siderophores as molecular targeting entities is in part 
hampered by their challenging synthetic access, their chemical lability as well as in some cases 
by their limited bacterial spectrum.16, 17, 18, 19 Fortunately, much like piracy, prokaryotes seize 
socalled xenosiderophores (siderophores produced by other organisms or even synthetic 
siderophore mimetics), to satisfy their iron demand.20 Along those lines, we established 
enterobactin analogues based on synthetic DOTAM and MECAM scaffolds as robust, readily 
accessible and variable vectors for bacterial imaging and antibacterial therapy in Gram
negative and Grampositive bacteria.21, 22, 23 
TBDTs are composed of a 22 barrel inserted into the outer membrane, a plug domain that 
closes the channel formed by the barrel, and the TonB box.10,24,25 The incoming ferric 
siderophore from the extracellular space binds to a specific site on the plug domain, promoting
