Description:
Utilized as a photoelectrode material in PEC applications.

suc
cessfully designed a photoanode by depositing a thin film of 
cationic polyelectrolytes and anionic CoPOMWOCs on the 
surface of various photoelectrode materials (e.g. Fe2O3, BiVO4 
and TiO2) for improving the PEC performance as well as sta
bility.19 Fan and coworkers reported CoPOM as a novel mo
lecular cocatalyst deposited on Ndoped carbon (NC) to 
boost the charge separation and injection of BiVO4 pho
toanodes for PEC water oxidation.20 Some of us have recently 
reported a direct linking of CoPOMs to the surface of Mo
doped BiVO4 photoanodes.
