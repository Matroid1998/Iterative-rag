Quasitype II giant coreshell quantum dots with reduced blinking and increased size.

Furthermore, external silica shells 
can be grown on coreshell QDs to increase the particle size to near 100 nm.17,27 Although silica shells 
provide a path for deterministic positioning of emissive QDs, the singleparticle PL of silicashelled QDs 
suffers a high degree of blinking due to additional charged states induced by the CdSSiO2 interface.17,28 
The largest emissive QDs without silica shells reported in the literature up to now are the traditional 
quasitype II giant coreshell CdSeCdS QDs, with 1520 CdS monolayers (MLs) and total diameters 
ranging from 20 to 50 nm.2932 The giant CdS shells not only increase the size of the emissive QDs but 
also reduce blinking through Auger recombination suppression and isolate the exciton from surface 
interaction.29,33,34 In these quasitype II coreshell systems, the electron wavefunction is delocalized into 
the CdS shell, while the hole wavefunction is effectively confined within the CdSe core.

Large core-shell quantum dots grown using SILAR and HTCI methods.

This geometric 
separation of charge carriers results in multiexciton formation that is advantageous for lasing and can 
affect the singlephoton purity.32,3538 
The two main methods to grow large coreshell CdSeCdS are successive ionic layer adsorption and 
reaction (SILAR) and hightemperature continuous injection (HTCI).29,30,39 The differences between the 
two methods and the correlation between synthetic conditions and QD properties have been rigorously 
studied by Hollingsworth and coworkers.29,30,40,41 By examining 20 nm, truncated octahedral QDs 
prepared by the two methods, they showed that while both methods result in nonblinking QDs with high 
stability, QDs prepared by the HTCI method have significantly higher PL quantum yield (QY) while QDs 
prepared by the SILAR method have better optical stability at ambient conditions.30 Further indepth 
analysis revealed that high crystalline quality with high interfacial alloying and low defect concentrations 
in the CdS shells could be achieved with the HTCI method by postsynthetic annealing and the use of 1
octanethiol, which acts as both S precursor and growthfacilitating ligand.30 Using the HTCI method but 
with S dissolved in ODE (SODE) as the sulfur precursor instead of 1octanethiol, Dubertret and
