performance and good processability has generated a lot of 
interest since they first became known as competitive high
performance solutions. BMI has been blended with titania, Ferric 
chloride as well as Graphene sheet. Metallization and APPJ 
treatment of Bismaleimide have shown better performance as 
corrosion protection and EMI shielding 6. BMI monomers are 
molecules with two maleimide functional groups terminating them; 
they frequently contain several aromatic moieties to improve their 
curing properties (Fig. 1a) shows the typical structure of these 
compounds) 7. The crystalline and structural configuration of the 
composite system generated at various temperatures was revealed 
through XRD and FTIR measurements 812.
