Description:
A commonly prescribed anticancer medication derived from eribulin.

Text:
Members of the halichondrin family exhibit potent cytotoxicity via microtubule 
growth inhibition, a mechanism that has been harnessed in the development of the commonly 
prescribed anticancer medication, eribulin (Halaven).510 Our synthetic efforts have led to the 
largescale preparation of the C52halichondrin B amine, which is currently in phase I clinical 
trials for the treatment of tumors.11 In the almost 40 years since their initial discovery, the 
halichondrin family has received significant attention from the synthetic community,1215 
culminating in total syntheses from Phillips,16 Nicolaou,1718 and our own group.1929 
Here, we report the total synthesis neonorhalichondrin B (1), the most challenging member of the 
halichondrin family identified todate. Neonorhalichondrin B was isolated by Blunt, Munro and 
coworkers as a minor constituent from Lissodendoryx sp.
