Description:
Forms larger structures by acidifying its monomeric precursors.

Metal oxides and molecularoxo clusters are key materials for the development of both current and future technologies.14 
These materials are usually prepared by crystallization of a solution containing molecular metaloxo clusters.5 However, how these 
compounds are formed in aqueous media, and how high nuclearities are obtained remain unclear.6 This is because the selfassembly 
of metaloxo clusters in water is affected by several variables temperature, pH, ionic force, concentration and counterions.7 One 
prominent type of molecular metal oxides are polyoxometalates (POMs). These polynuclear clusters consist of group V and VI metals 
at high oxidation states and with multiple oxoligands. Group VI POMs have been studied extensively with an assemble via bottom
up route.8,9 Larger structures are formed by just acidifying the molybdenum and tungsten monomeric precursors.
