Description:
A second messenger involved in mediating various physiological processes through complex signal transduction cascades.

Text:
Consequently, cAMP levels are 
not uniform inside the cell, which is the fundamental clue to 
understand why cAMP can mediate such a plethora of different 
physiological processes in one cell.7,12 It is this non
homogeneous distribution of cAMP and the consequences 
arising thereof that have not yet been fully unraveled.7 Thus, to 
better understand the complex signal transduction cascade 
mediated via the second messenger cAMP, full spatial and 
temporal control of its intracellular activity by photochromic 
derivatives promises new insights not available by other means.
