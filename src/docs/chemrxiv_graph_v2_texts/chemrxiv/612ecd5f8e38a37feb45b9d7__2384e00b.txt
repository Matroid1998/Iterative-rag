Description:
Used in copolymerization and terpolymerization with ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2propenoates.

Text:
Synthetic manipulation of polymer substrates via copolymerization is one of the oldest and 
most reliable methods to increase the functional diversity of soft materials 1. Ring
substituted ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2propenoates (ECPP), RPhCHC(CN)CO2C2H5 
continue to attract attention as comonomers for modification of commercial polymers. Ring 
unsubstituted ECPP has been copolymerized with acrylonitrile 2, styrene 3, vinyl acetate 
4, 5, acrylic esters 6, and 1,2ethanediyl ester of 2methylpropenoic acid 7. Terpolymerization of ECPP was reported with acrylonitrile and styrene 8, and ethyl 
acrylate and styrene 9. Also reported are curable adhesive and coating compositions 
containing trifunctional olefinic monomers, including ECPP 10.
