Description:
Decarboxylates to form 4vinylcatechol, a key monomer for adhesive materials.

For 
instance, 4vinylphenol (2a) derived from pcoumaric acid is used in polymer chemistry for the 
production of photoresists, adhesives and epoxycuring agents.2628 The decarboxylation product of 
caffeic acid, 4vinylcatechol (2b), is a key monomer for adhesive materials inspired by mussel adhesive 
protein.2,29 Unfortunately, the hydroxy group is prone to induce side reactions, complicating the direct 
polymerization of these functional styrene derivatives.30 This complicates their isolation, storage, and 
polymerization.31 Furthermore, achieving controlled polymerization of phenolic styrenes is challenging. It requires demanding reaction conditions and the use of additives and chaintransfer agents, which limit 
their potential for technical application.23,31,32 The tendency of phenolic styrenes to undergo 
spontaneous polymerization and side reactions complicate downstream processing.
