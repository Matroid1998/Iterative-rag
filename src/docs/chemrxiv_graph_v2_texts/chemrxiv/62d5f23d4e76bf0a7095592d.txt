Description:
A material whose mechanical and physicochemical properties impact drug release kinetics.

Text:
Furthermore, 
when exposed to the particle surface, the conjugated moiety can bind a receptor and thus mediate the 
anchoring of the drug or particle to a biological target. Also, in response to environmental stimuli, it 
can become susceptible to cleavage so to facilitate the release of the drug in its active configuration 
in a desired site.3 
The impact of the mechanical and physicochemical properties of PLGAbased materials on drug 
release kinetics have been extensively studied and characterized experimentally. After fabrication, 
the drug trapped in the amorphous PLGA matrix is poorly mobile. Upon suspension of the particle in
