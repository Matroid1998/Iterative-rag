A broad-spectrum drug with antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity.

Text:
In industrial farming, several antimicrobial drugs, growth hormones, and other pharmaceuticals are com
monly administered to the farm animals to treat infections and, prophylactically, to prevent disease or spur 
growth. Over recent decades, public awareness of pharmaceutical toxicity in foods of animal origin has 
grown tremendously 1. Consumers continuously express their concern about the risks to health because 
of the presence of these substances in food products 2. Metronidazole (MTZ) is a broadspectrum drug 
of antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity. Residues of these substances may remain in food. Hence, they 
may pose a real menace to consumers 2. Therefore, the European Commission (EC) strictly regulates 
the use of veterinary drugs to feed farm animals 1.
