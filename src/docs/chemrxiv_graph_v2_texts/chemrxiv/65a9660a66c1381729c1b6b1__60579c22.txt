Description:
A flammable gas detectable at ppm or ppb concentrations.

The growing concerns about the impact of the harmful gas emissions on the 
human health and the environment, as pointed out by the World Health Organization 
reports 1, has stimulated the research for solidstate gas sensing devices with better 
sensitivity and low production costs. Thus, new systems are searched for being sensitive 
in detecting ppm or ppb concentrations of flammable (H2, ethanol, hydrocarbons) and 
toxic (H2S, CO, NO2) gases. Additionally, they also must present selectivity in the 
presence of interferent gases 24, and be able to operate at temperatures closer to 
environmental conditions. Recently, it has been shown that the increased concentration 
of NO2 may have some influence on SARSCoV2 infections 5,6. Such facts highlight 
the urgency of developing new sensors that are simple and affordable for monitoring.
