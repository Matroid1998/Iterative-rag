Description:
A redox-active material used in aqueous redox flow batteries.

Text:
The need for decarbonization, the advantages of electricalgrid decentralization, and the 
intermittency of wind and solar energy are motivations for the development of gridscale storage 
technologies.1, 2 The aqueous redox flow battery (ARFB) is a promising solution, featuring safety, 
the decoupling of energy and power capacities, and potential long lifetime, recyclability, and low 
cost. Redoxactive materials have been rapidly developed to approach the requirements for 
practical gridscale storage. (Cl exchange)
