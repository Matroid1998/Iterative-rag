Description:
A ligand with higher steric demand and stronger donating properties.

Text:
As a consequence, metal complexes become more stable 
compared to their unsubstituted analogues or possess higher 
catalytic activity.8 
The permethylated pentamethylcyclopentadienyl C5Me5 (Cp, 
Figure 1A) was introduced in 1960 and has developed into a 
ubiquitous ligand due to its higher steric demand and stronger 
donating properties.9 These properties led to isolation of metal 
complexes which were previously unstable with Cp ligands, 
e.g.
