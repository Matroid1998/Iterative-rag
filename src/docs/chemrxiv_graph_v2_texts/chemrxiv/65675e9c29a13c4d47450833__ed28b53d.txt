Description:
A mesoporous material used as a solid sorbent.

Text:
Such solid sorbents
include zeolites, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) and mesoporous silica. Typically,
desirable sorbent should have high CO2 uptake at the relevant partial pressure range (15 of the
total gas pressure, i.e. 15 kPa for a total flue gas pressure of 1 bar), high CO2 selectivity, fast CO2
adsorption and desorption kinetics, and high cyclic stability. Figure 1. Structure of NbOFFIVE1Ni, with the distance between two opposite F atoms labelled
(3.2 ), this distance is also the effective smallest pore size. Zeolites and some Alcontaining zeotypes can effectively capture CO2 from flue gas, but a
significant drawback of these materials is their high hydrophilicity. MOFs are, comparatively not
