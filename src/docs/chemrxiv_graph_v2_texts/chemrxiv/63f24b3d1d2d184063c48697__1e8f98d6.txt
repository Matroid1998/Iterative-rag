Description:
A material possessing the highest hardness and the best thermal conductivity among natural materials.

Carbon is the chemical element which is the basis for organic compounds. Including itself, carbon is
stable bonding with many elements, allowing the formation of key molecules for life. As pure
element, we can find it in diamond, the material possessing the highest hardness and the best thermal
conductivity among the natural materials (Sparavigna, 2002). In diamond, carbon arranges itself in a
face centered cubic Bravais lattice. In graphite, carbon is stacked in layers of graphene, with a
honeycomb lattice. Actually, the term graphene is coming from graphite and the suffix ene,
which is reflecting the abundance of double bonds according to organic chemistry nomenclature
(Katsnelson, 2016). IUPAC recommends the name graphite for the threedimensional material, and
graphene only when the properties of the individual layers are considered.
