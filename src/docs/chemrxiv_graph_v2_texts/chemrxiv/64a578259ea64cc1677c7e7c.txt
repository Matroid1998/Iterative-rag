Description:
Used as a matrix in phosphor-doped materials to achieve ultralong RTP emissions due to hydrogen-bonding interactions.

Polymerbased roomtemperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials attracted 
considerable attention in the past decades owing to their advantages, such as easy 
processing, good flexibility, and low toxicity.16 In the past decades, lots of work made 
great efforts to develop RTP materials possessing excellent luminescent performance 
including long lifetime and high brightness.711 The previous reports have mainly 
focused on achieving this objective through chemical approaches.1216 For one thing, 
phosphors with certain chemical structures are developed according to the basic 
principle of triplet emissions, such as introducing lonepair electrons to enhance 
intersystem crossing (ISC).1723 For another thing, various polymers possessing strong 
interactions with dopants were selected as the matrixes.2430 For instance, recently, it is 
reported that ultralong RTP emissions can be achieved in phosphordoped poly(vinyl 
alcohol) (PVA), and it is ascribed to the rigid environment established by abundant 
hydrogenbonding interactions and the coassembly eect between the chromophores 
and PVA chains.3135 
Compared to the chemical approaches mentioned above, physical approaches, 
such as heating, pressing, stretching, etc, are usually easier to carry out.
