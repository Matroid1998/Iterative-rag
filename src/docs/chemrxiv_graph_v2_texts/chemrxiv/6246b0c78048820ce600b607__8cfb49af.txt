Description:
Formed by the conversion of NO on the Si(111)7x7 surface through an onsurface heterogeneous process.

Text:
Therefore, we chose the Si(111)7x7 surface because this 
surface is known to be very reactive6 and is able to convert, for 
instance, NO into N2O by onsurface heterogeneous process 6 or 
to dissociate NH3 into layers of Si3N4.7 Surprisingly, there is no 
report of the dissociation of N2 on the Si(111)7x7 surface. After 
the preparation of the Si(111)7x7 surface in ultrahigh vacuum 
(UHV) by standard procedure, the surface was exposed to N2 
molecular gas for 30 minutes at different pressures ranging 
from 6109 mbar to 5105 mbar.
