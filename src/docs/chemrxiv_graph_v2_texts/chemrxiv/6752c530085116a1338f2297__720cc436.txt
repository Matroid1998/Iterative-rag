Description:
Used as a monomer in the synthesis of polymers.

Text:
Chloroethenes (abbreviated CEs throughout this article) of the general formula C2H4xClx with 
x  1, 2, 3, 4 are widely used in various industrial processes1 The monosubstituted form, vinyl 
chloride (chloroethene), one of the worlds most important commodity chemicals, is primarily 
used as monomer in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a widespread and versatile 
polymer. Among the three dichloroethene isomers, 1,1dichloroethene also finds use as 
monomer in the synthesis of polymers. The cis and trans forms of 1,2dichloroethene, which 
occur as byproducts in some processes, are in limited demand, with niche applications as 
solvents and cleaning agents.
