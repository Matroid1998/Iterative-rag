Nathanson, Minton, and others have paved the way for molecular beam experiments on the gasliquid

interface.3544 These experiments have elucidated an unprecedented level of mechanistic detail behind gas

The advent of microfluidic chips that generate flat liquid jets47 led us to perform angleresolved 
58 
molecular beam scattering experiments on the vacuumdodecane interface. In this paper, we highlight our 
59 
previous results4850 scattering select species from a dodecane flat liquid jet, where we compared how the 
60 
dodecane surface differs from other hydrocarbon surfaces such as squalane.35,51 We also present new
