Description:
Forms linear tail chains that can lose helical arrangement.

Text:
of an additional electron causes a loss of the 
helical arrangement along linear carbon tail chains. Regaining helicity is sufficiently favourable to enable 
fluoride release in C7C10 carboxylate or sulfonate PFAS chains; shorter chains are enthalpically 
hindered from degradation while the additional charge is stabilized on longer chains by the greater 
entropy their flexibility permits. These results suggest that reductive PFAS treatment processes could be 
made more effective under high pressure or confined conditions. Introduction 
Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large class of aliphatic compounds in which 
all carbonhydrogen bonds in the nonfluorinated equivalent have been replaced with carbon
fluorine bonds. Fluorination results in increased hydrophobicity and resistance to chemical or 
physical degradation as compared to their hydrogenated alkyl counterparts1.
