Description:
Molecules characterized by a mechanical bond formed by a macrocycle threaded onto a linear component, allowing for coconformation changes.

Text:
rotaxanes and hydrogenbonded 
homo heterodimers. The method provides insight on coconformation in rotaxanes, and tautomeric con
figuration, conformation and speciation in selfsorted mixtures of hydrogenbonded motifs.
