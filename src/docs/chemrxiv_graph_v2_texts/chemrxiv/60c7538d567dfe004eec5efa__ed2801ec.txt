Description:
Transported into the cell by system xC in exchange for intracellular glutamate.

The elevated expression of system xC
 in a wide range of cancer types can be targeted by
radiotracers specific to this transporter to provide high contrast images of tumors 7, 11, 1618. Clinically, 18FFSPG has been evaluated in hepatocellular carcinoma, nonsmall cell lung
cancer, prostate cancer and intracranial malignancies 9, 15, 18, 19. Interest in noninvasively imaging system xC
 has increased as its central role in modulating
cellular redox homeostasis has emerged 17, 2022. System xC
 transports extracellular cystine
into the cell in exchange for intracellular glutamate 23. Once transported into the cell, cystine is
quickly reduced to cysteine, the rate limiting substrate for de novo glutathione synthesis 24.
