Description:
Activates peroxidases to form a ferryl ion porphyrin cation radical species.

Text:
As shown in Scheme 1, the catalytic cycle of LiP involves 
three main stages.26, 33 Similar to other peroxidases, the first 
stage (I) involves the activation by H2O2 to form a ferryl ion 
porphyrin cation radical species (Cpd I), a common active 
species in peroxidases.32, 3436 In the second stage (II), CpdI
