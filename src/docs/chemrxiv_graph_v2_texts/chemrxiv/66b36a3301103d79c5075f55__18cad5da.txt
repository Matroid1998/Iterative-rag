Description:
A species of interest in catalysis.

Text:
Along these lines, it is of fundamental interest to 
also expand our knowledge on Ru(I) and Ru(III) 
2alkyne com
plexes and thus lay a foundation to either truly excluded or actually 
identify these species in catalysis.5 In this context, Bennett and co
workers set out to prepare the first Ru(III) 
2alkyne complex (B) 
via 1e oxidation of the corresponding Ru(II) derivative (A, see Fig
ure 1).6 Interestingly, an inspection of the RuC distances in 
A and 
B suggested that the alkyne in B is more strongly bound than the al
kyne in A,6 while an opposite trend has been uncovered for closely 
related Ru  2olefine complexes.7 
Considering that no other pair of Ru(II)Ru(III) 
2alkyne com
plexes has been characterized crystallographically in both relevant 
oxidation states, we became interested in corroborating Bennetts 
results by using our (potentially tridentate) 2,2
diphosphinotolane 
scaffold (1P, see Figure 1)8 for the synthesis of Ru(III) 
2alkyne 
complexes.

Description:
A type of complex that contains phosphines and varies in valence electron counts and geometries.

Text:
Due to the presence of two phosphines in 1P, we speculated that 
this approach may also allow for the synthesis of a hitherto unknown 
Ru(I)  2alkyne complex. In this context, it needs to be noted that all 
the yet known mononuclear Ru(I) complexes actually contain phos
phines,9, 10 but differ in their valence electron counts and in their ge
ometries.

Description:
A complex that can exist in a trigonal bipyramidal or square planar coordination environment.

Text:
While Peters and others succeeded in isolating trigonal bi
pyramidal 17valencee Ru(I) complexes,9a, c, e Grtzmacher re
ported a unique 15valencee Ru(I) complex in a square planar co
ordination environment.9d The latter 15valencee Ru(I) complex 
(D) comprises two coordinated olefins and two mutually cisposi
tioned phosphines, while an  6arene interaction (between the metal 
and one of the arenes in tropPPh2, see Figure 1) was found in the 
corresponding Ru(II) counterpart (C).9d Given that these stereo
chemical peculiarities interfere with an unambiguous comparison of 
C and D, our strategy to employ a rigid tridentate scaffold (such as 
1P) for the synthesis of mutually comparable Ru(I), Ru(II) and
