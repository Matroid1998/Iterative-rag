Description:
A polymer excipient used for the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions.

Text:
This method involves melting and 
intensive mixing of the drug into the polymer matrix, resulting in the formation of a single 
phase.10 There are numerous wellknown and wellstudied polymer excipients for the 
preparation of ASDs11, such as poly(2ethyl2oxazoline) and its structural similar polyvinyl 
pyrrolidone resulting in a better performance of the 2oxazoline based polymer12. The selection 
of an excipient is not only based on the processability using a given method and the possibility 
of designing a controlled release from the amorphous formulation, but also the miscibility and 
possible interactions between drug and polymer play an important role.13 
Previously, poly(2oxazoline)poly(2oxazine) triblock copolymers have been employed 
very successfully in high drug loading formulations14 with up to and more than 50 wt.
