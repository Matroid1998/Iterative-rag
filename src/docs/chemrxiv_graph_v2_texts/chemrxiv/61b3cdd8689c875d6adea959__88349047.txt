Description:
A cosubstrate in LPMO reactions and synthesized in the absence of substrate.

H atoms to be abstracted by the reactive oxygen species shown in green. While H2O2 has also been shown to be a LPMO cosubstrate,6 the work presented here focuses on 
the activation of O2, the first characterized cosubstrate in polysaccharide oxidation and the substrate in 
the synthesis of H2O2 in absence of substrate.35 Oneelectron reduction of the copper active site to Cu1 
and binding of the molecular oxygen cosubstrate initiates the reaction cycle with the generally accepted
