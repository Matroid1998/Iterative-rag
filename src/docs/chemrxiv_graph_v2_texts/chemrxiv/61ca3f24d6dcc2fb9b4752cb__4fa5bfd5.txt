Description:
Adsorbs onto active sites, potentially blocking them in alkaline media.

Currently, 
the two prevalent methods for obtaining hydrogen are protonexchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis 
7 and alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) 8. The hydrogen production efficiency of PEM 
electrolyzers is higher but requires Ptbased catalysts 9. In the case of AWE, the key goal is high 
catalytic activity and stability under intermittent polarization in alkaline media 10. It is well known 
that the HER rate in alkaline media is inferior to that in acidic ones 11, 12 because of the additional 
water dissociation step 13, precedes the discharge step, but also due to the blockage of active sites 
by adsorbed hydroxyl ions, but also partly due to hydroxyl ion adsorption resulting in the blockage of 
active sites 5.
