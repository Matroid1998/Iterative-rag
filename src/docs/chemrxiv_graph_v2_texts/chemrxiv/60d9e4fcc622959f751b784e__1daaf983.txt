Description:
Interacts with an arginine residue near the heme site in peroxygenases.

Text:
The unique structural aspect of peroxygenases is the interaction of the carboxylate group 
of the fatty acids with an Arginine residue close to the heme site. This feature bypasses the 
necessity of acidalcohol pair for proton deliveries as in common P450s.11 These special features 
of P450 peroxygenases indicate that this group of enzymes might have been bioengineered by 
Nature during primeval conditions which necessitate bypassing dioxygen requirement for the 
catalytic cycle.12,13 Despite these differences, peroxygenases catalyze fatty acid oxidation, by use
