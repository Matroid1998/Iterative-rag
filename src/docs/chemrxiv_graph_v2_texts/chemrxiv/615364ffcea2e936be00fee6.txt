Description:
Involved in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by ATPases or motor proteins.

Text:
Specifically, the dynamics in synthetic examples either result from a 
change in the overall environment (e.g., by changing pH, ionic 
strength), thereby irreversibly driving the system into a new global 
minimum, or, in the case of light, lifts the system to a different energy 
landscape. Conversely, natural molecular machines, such as ATPases 
or motor proteins, couple the catalysis of a chemical reaction, e.g., the 
hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphates, to their conformational 
change they incessantly consume fuel to drive their motion30.
