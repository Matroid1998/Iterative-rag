Description:
A ubiquitous congener of azetidine in drug discovery.

Text:
Furthermore, the azetidine can serve as bioisosteric replacements for pyrrolidine,8 piperidine,9 and the phenyl 
ring.10 For instance, in the study of the 5HT2C agonist (Figure 1B, last example), replacing piperidine with 
azetidine led to enhanced potency.11 However, despite these advantages, azetidine remains relatively 
underexplored in drug discovery campaigns compared to its ubiquitous congeners, pyrrolidine and piperidine, 
likely due to the significant synthetic challenges.12
