Description:
Marketed name for ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor with solubility challenges.

Text:
Solubility is a critical property for pharmaceutical drug
discovery, and problems with solubility can frustrate drug
discovery efforts and block treatments. The bioavailabil
ity of a drug depends on the solubility difference between
different crystal structures (polymorphs), dose, drug per
meability, and formulation 1, so solubility plays a key
role. Solubility problems can be unexpected and pose
crucial obstacles that even threaten the administration
of care. For example, a welldocumented case occurred
in the late 90s when ritonavir, an HIVprotease inhibitor
marketed as Norvir, failed dissolution requirements 2. Since ritonavir is not bioavailable in its solid form, it was
administrated in capsules containing solutions designed
not to be saturated with respect to the originally known
molecular crystal (form I) 2.

Description:
A drug whose supply was threatened by the stability and crystallization difficulty of its new polymorph form II.

Text:
The newly identied poly
morph, form II, was unusually stable and unusually hard
to crystallize; the preparation protocol of Norvir was inad
equate to make capsules from the new polymorph, which
severely threatened the supply of the drug in the market
and endangered the lives of many HIV patients 2. Con
siderable effort has already been devoted to the methods
to predict crystal polymorphs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but much
less attention has been given to methods to predict solu
bilities, with or without likely polymorphs as input.
