Description:
A gasket material used in proton exchange membrane reactors.

Text:
Protonexchange membrane (PEM) reactors, which were originally devised for fuel cell 
technology,1,2 have been used for electrocatalytic synthesis because they possess many 
characteristics designed to overcome the disadvantages of conventional electrosynthetic 
processes.310 A PEM features a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at its center (Figure 1a); the 
MEA is closely packed with a Teflon gasket, carbon separator, and an end plate at both sides 
(Figure S1). The MEA comprises an ionexchange membrane (protonconducting polymer) 
sandwiched between a pair of catalyst layers on the anode and cathode sides; the membrane thus 
serves dual roles as an electrode and a supporting electrolyte (Figure 1b). Consequently, the 
substrate solution does not require a supporting electrolyte and the cell resistance can be minimized.
