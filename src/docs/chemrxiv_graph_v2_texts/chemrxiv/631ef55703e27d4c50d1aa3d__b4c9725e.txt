Description:
Stable at lower temperatures, below 267 K at standard state pressure and below 452 K with 2 MPa H2 pressure.

Text:
Formation of the gasphase CO is allowed at high temperatures, with rG for rWGSR being downhill
above 1097 K at standard state pressure and above 629 K at 2 MPa H2 pressure. On the other hand,
CH3OH is only stable (rG  0) at lower temperatures, i.e. below 267 K at standard state pressure and
below 452 K with 2 MPa H2 pressure. The formation of CO rather than CH3OH can therefore largely be
achieved by controlling the reaction conditions. More importantly, the equilibrium strongly favors CH4
formation rather than CO formation below 900 K or at increased H2 pressure.9,10 It is therefore
important to have a catalyst that is selective towards CO instead of CH4 when the goal is the rWGSR. 2
