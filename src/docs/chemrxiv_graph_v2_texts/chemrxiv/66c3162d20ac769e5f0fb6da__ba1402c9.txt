The pursuit of a sustainable future has propelled lithiumion batteries (LIBs) into a pivotal role across 
diverse technological realms1. Initially confined to consumer electronics, LIBs have become 
indispensable in electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, offgrid power systems, and grid 
stabilization applications. A comprehensive understanding of the chemophysical behavior is essential 
to unlock the full potential of LIBs within complex and multicomponent systems such as electric 
vehicles and grid storage. The concept of memory effect in batteries has gained widespread recognition in the case of NiCd 
and Nimetalhydride systems, where traces of prior cycling are retained, distorting the voltage 
profile24. Interestingly, while this phenomenon has been assumed not to affect LIBs, a pivotal study 
by Sasaki et al.5 provided first insights that this may not be true.
