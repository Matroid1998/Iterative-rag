Description:
A phosphate-based zeotype with low stability.

Text:
Systems containing Gerich d4r units have received partic
ular attention due to the possibility to selectively remove Ge from the framework.32,33 Selective 
Ge removal forms the basis of the socalled ADOR (assembly  disassembly  organisation  reas
sembly) mechanism, a versatile strategy to prepare new frameworks that are unavailable through 
direct synthesis.25,34 Finally, several phosphatebased zeotypes with d4r cages have been synthe
sised in fluoridecontaining media, among them the extralarge pore gallophosphate (GaPO) clo
verite (CLO)35 and LTAtype aluminophosphates (AlPOs).36,37 While practical applications of 
cloverite are severely limited due to its low stability,38 AlPO4LTA has been employed in mem
branebased separations39 and in thermal energy storage.40,41
