Description:
A gas used in electrochemical reduction to produce fuels and chemical feedstocks with renewable energy.

Background 
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is a rapidly developing 
technology that, if successfully commercialized, may provide a 
means to produce fuels and commodity chemical feedstocks 
with renewable energy, rather than from fossil fuels. CO2R was 
originally performed in socalled aqueous Hcells, which had the 
cathode fully immersed in a liquid electrolyte and CO2 supplied 
to the cathode by dissolution into the electrolyte. Subsequently, 
current densities over 10x higher were achieved by using 
reactors with gasdiffusion electrode (GDE) cathodes.1 GDEs 
position the interface of gasphase CO2 and liquid electrolyte in 
close proximity to the catalyst layer (CL), providing fast diffusion 
of CO2 in the gasphase, as well as fast diffusion across mere 10s 
to 1000s of nanometers of liquid between the gasphase and 
the electrocatalyst.
