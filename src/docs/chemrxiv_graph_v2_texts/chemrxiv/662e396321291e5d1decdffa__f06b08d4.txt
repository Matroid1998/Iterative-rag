Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations.

Text:
The rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide as a notorious example, in our 
atmosphere have propelled sustainable processing and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) to the 
forefront of both academic and industrial research efforts.15 Tackling the carbon footprint challenge 
necessitates a collaborative endeavor across various disciplines.

Description:
An ideal C1 building block with an inert nature that limits its widespread application in synthetic organic chemistry.

Text:
Chemistry and chemical engineering, 
guided by the principles of green chemistry, take on a pivotal role in advancing this overarching goal.6,7 
This entails a fundamental shift away from conventional fossil fuelbased methodologies towards 
sustainable alternatives, exemplified by the emergence of photochemical processes and circular 
chemistry practices.8,9 These approaches leverage milder conditions and, where feasible, harness solar 
energy as a green and renewable driving force for reactions.1013 Integrating solarpowered or assisted 
techniques with continuousflow technologies offers enhanced control, scalability, selectivity, as well 
as superior mass and heat transfer capabilities to processes.1417 
Although carbon dioxide represents an ideal C1 building block, its inert nature has limited widespread 
application in synthetic organic chemistry.

Description:
Can be reduced through hydrogenation reactions such as the Sabatier reaction and reverse water gas shift reaction.

Text:
Arguably, a more promising approach involves converting 
CO2 into diverse C1 building blocks like methane or carbon monoxide.18 Particularly, carbon monoxide 
serves as an activated C1 building block with abundant associated chemistry. Reduction of CO2 can be 
achieved through hydrogenation reactions, such as the Sabatier reaction and reverse water gas shift 
(RWGS) reaction. These reactions have also been investigated as lightassisted processes in 
photochemical or photothermal systems,1921 thereby lowering energy consumption and enhancing 
sustainability.2224 
To date, significant strides have been made in the development and evaluation of catalysts and reactor 
systems for the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide.2533 However, direct comparison of the performance 
and efficacy of these catalysts remains challenging due to the absence of standardized operational 
procedures.

Description:
A product of hydrogenation processes in continuous light-assisted systems.

Text:
The 
precise control and modularity of this system facilitate the continuous lightassisted production of 
carbon dioxide hydrogenation products, which can be seamlessly integrated into downstream units. In 
this study, we leverage the generated carbon monoxide as a reagent in a diverse array of palladium
