The task of optimization is prevalent in any scientific discipline. Material optimization and discovery, in particular, have 
propelled technological advancements, creating a materially 
different generation compared to previous ones. The current 
climate crisis poses a severe threat to the wellbeing of 
humanity, where innovation in energy materials is needed to 
tackle a monumental challenge of this scale. Establishing a 
renewable energy landscape is of utmost importance to secure 
a sustainable energy supply while maintaining current living 
standards in the near future. Electricity from wind and solar is 
intermittent, necessitating its storage into energydense 
molecules such as hydrogen to cover energy demands at any 
time, even during downtimes of renewable electricity 
production.

Description:
Generated as green hydrogen in polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis.

Text:
Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) will 
be a cornerstone in the future energy transition, generating 
green hydrogen to end the reliance on current fossilbased 
energy carriers.1, 2 Here, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is 
profoundly more sluggish than the hydrogen evolution reaction 
(HER). Given that anodic and cathodic reactions proceed 
simultaneously, the slower reaction ultimately determines the 
total device efficiency, making the improvement of OER kinetics 
a main target of many research endeavors in the water splitting 
community. Electrocatalysts build the heart of electrochemical 
devices and act as reaction promoters. So far, IrOx has become 
the stateoftheart OER catalyst for PEMWEs.
