Description:
A product of O2 reduction by oxidases in electrochemical biosensors.

Text:
This property of 
oxidases was exploited in firstgeneration electrochemical biosensors, which were poised to 
detect the product of O2 reduction by the oxidase, hydrogen peroxide (2). However, this O2 
dependency inherently limits the sensors performance, especially at high substrate 
concentrations (17). In secondgeneration biosensors, artificial electron mediators are employed 
to accept the electrons from the oxidase and shuttle them to the electrode, theoretically making 
the sensing independent of O2 (2, 18). Nevertheless, O2 still competes with the artificial 
mediators for the electrons generated by the oxidase (19, 20), diverting them away from the 
electrode (Figure 1a). The result is a decrease in the current signal, which leads to an 
underestimation of the analyte concentration (21) (Figure 1b).
