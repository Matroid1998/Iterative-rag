Used as the initial solvent in adsorption isotherms for OTA in the liquid phase.

of 21 mol g1 of 1 into the resin architecture, 
and the successful linkage between 1 and EG40 via the phenoxy 
unit of the Tyr residue was confirmed by the absence of Tyr in 
the hydrolyzed solution (Table S1). The nitrogen adsorption iso
therm at 77 K showed retention of mesoporosity in poly1 after 
functionalization (Fig. S2 and Table S2). The affinity of OTA as 
an adsorbent for poly1 was investigated by determining the ad
sorption isotherms in the liquid phase using acetonitrile as the 
initial solvent. The temperature of the solution severely affected 
the thermodynamic parameters; therefore, the temperature of the 
system was carefully controlled during the investigation.

Description:
A solvent used in the dispersion of poly1 and OTA.

Text:
When 
poly1 was dispersed in an acetonitrile solution of OTA, the emis
sion from OTA decreased to a level close to zero within 2 h (Fig. S3) following an intraparticle diffusion model (vide infra). Fig 
3b shows a sharp slope at extremely low concentrations ( 5 nM) 
of OTA for the poly1OTA pair. In contrast, when a polymer 
without functionalization of 1 was used instead of poly1, almost 
no change was observed in the emission spectra. This accounts 
for spontaneous complexation between poly1 and OTA at the in
terfaces being thermodynamically favorable. The adsorption iso
therms of poly1 at 273 K showed biLangmuir behavior in ace
tonitrile (Figs.
