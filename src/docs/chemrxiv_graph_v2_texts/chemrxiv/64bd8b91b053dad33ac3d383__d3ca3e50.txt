Description:
One of the most efficient promoters of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions.

Text:
The management of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of remarkable significance in 
modern technological growth. There is a desire to not only expedite the reaction by catalysts 
to increase hydrogen production due to its selection as an exceptional energy storing resource, 
but also to hinder it. Trasattis 1 Volcano Plot effectively illustrates the effect of metals on 
the HER catalysis in acidic solutions. Pt, Re, and Rh are the most efficient HER promoters 
perched atop the volcano. In the ascending branch of the plot, Ti, Pb, Cd, and In show around 
six orders of magnitude lower currents because of hydrogen evolution than the top ones. The 
main application in which HER needs to be inhibited is the leadacid battery (LAB).
