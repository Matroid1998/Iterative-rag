Description:
A nucleophilic residue involved in enzyme catalysis.

However, similar wellstudied enzymes, such as other class
I GATs and cysteineserine proteases provide a useful the
oretical foundation.3,4,713 These reactions are proposed to 
occur via two stages acylation and deacylation. In the acyl
ation stage, the nucleophilic hCys84 attacks glutamine to 
form a glutamyl thioester, first structurally observed in an
other classI GAT, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase,10 via a 
tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. In the deacylation stage, 
nucleophilic attack by a water molecule breaks down the co
valent enzymesubstrate intermediate thioester, to yield 
the glutamate product. The ratelimiting step is proposed to 
occur during acylation in IGPS,14 as well as related classI
