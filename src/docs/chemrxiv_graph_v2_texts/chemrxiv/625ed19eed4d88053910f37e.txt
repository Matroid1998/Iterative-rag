Description:
Known for its low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, and corrosion resistance, making it widely used in aerospace, military, and automotive sectors.

To create new materials, a thorough grasp of the link between material processing, structure, and 
attributes is required 1. The demand for enhancing the mechanical characteristics of alloys has 
risen as technology and industry demands have evolved. The utilization of composites containing 
highmechanicalproperty reinforcing particles has risen dramatically in recent years 2. One of 
the most prevalent ways of composite manufacture is solidstate processing, which grinds the base 
metal and reinforcing particles without melting the material, resulting in increased mechanical 
qualities and corrosion resistance 3,4. Aluminumbased composites are used in a variety of 
sectors. Because of their low density, high strengthtoweight ratio, and corrosion resistance, 
aluminum alloys are widely employed in the aerospace, military, and automotive sectors 510.

Aluminum alloy characteristics may be altered by using controlled procedures such as friction stir 
processing to incorporate additional particles, resulting in strong Aluminumbased composites 
11. Friction stir processing is a method for changing the characteristics of a surface without 
changing the properties of the underlying metal. It is based on the manufacture, processing, and 
synthesis of materials 1215. Aluminum alloys and composites are widely used by researchers in the engineering and material 
science field. In 2009, Yazdipour et al. 16 evaluated the influence of process parameters on the 
final grain size of Aluminum sheets by friction stir processing. They discovered that the process
