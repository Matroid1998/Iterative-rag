Description:
A gas that can be chemically absorbed by aqueous amine solutions.

As 
such, porous liquids might allow for new, different processes, rather than simply replacing 
porous solids. There are already excellent examples of what conventional (nonporous) liquid solvents can 
achieve in industrial processes such as wetscrubbing for CO2 capture, which involves 
aqueous amine solutions to chemically absorb CO2.23 However, this typically requires large 
amounts of energy to regenerate the liquid.24 Porous liquids, on the other hand, might be 
adapted into existing infrastructure that uses conventional flow processes, while also lowering 
the energy penalty of solvent regeneration by exploiting physisorption rather than 
chemisorption.25,26 In addition, the incorporation of discrete molecules or frameworks into a 
liquid also adds the potential for shape and size specificity, allowing porous liquids to be 
tailored towards target separations and applications.27,28
