Description:
Ten coordinated ions analyzed to determine ideal coordination polyhedra resemblance.

Text:
Here, we use Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) to analyze ten
coordinated lanthanide ions in order to determine which ideal coordination polyhedra they 
resemble, and to compare between the different experimental coordination geometries. The use 
of CSM in chemistry was introduced by Zabrodsky, Peleg and Avnir and has since been extended 
into a Continuous Shape Measure approach (CShM), which has been automated in the SHAPE 
2.1 program developed by Alvarez, RuizMartnez and Llunell.2642 Numerous studies have used 
SHAPE to compare symmetries, but we recently found that SHAPE can be inadequate when 
comparing high coordination number geometries.43 Here we elaborate on this in a series of six
