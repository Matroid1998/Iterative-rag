Description:
A material with high electrical conductivity and optical transparency, used in transparent and optoelectronics.

Text:
Indium oxide (In2O3) is a material of high interest due to its high electrical conductivity 
and optical transparency, making it a key material for transparent and optoelectronics1 
e.g. microelectronic displays on touch screens. The electrical conductivity of In2O32 is 
controlled by the stoichiometry of the film3 and is typically enhanced by substituting the 
In atoms with 510 atomic  Sn4,5. All applications of In2O3 as transparent conducting 
layers require the deposition of highquality thin films of In2O3. This requirement is the 
driving force for extensive studies by sputtering6, thermal evaporation7, chemical vapor 
deposition8, and atomic layer deposition (ALD)9.
