Description:
A TADF compound reported by Tang et al.

Text:
Its 
rigid, planar framework and the twisted DA conformation yield a short delayed lifetime d, of 
2.0 s, resulting in a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate kRISC of 10.01  105 s1 and a small 
EST of 0.05 eV. The high PL of 89 reflects a slow knr of 1.1  106 s1 and a fast kr of 9.3  
106 s1 for this compound.11 Tang et al. reported a family of related TADF compounds, (13) 
PXZBP, using PXZ as the strong donor. The PL progressively redshifts with an increasing
