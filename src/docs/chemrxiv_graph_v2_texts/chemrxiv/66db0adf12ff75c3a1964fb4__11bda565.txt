Description:
A strong bond contributing to the chemical and thermal stability of UiO66.

2D MOFs are synthesized in lamellar sheets, where it has been shown that these layers can be exfoliated into monolayers which are 
attractive as a building block of thin films.13, 18, 19 
UiO66, named after the University of Oslo,20 is one of the most studied MOFs thanks to its exceptional chemical and thermal 
stability attributed to a strong ZrO bond and a high coordination number of Zr.21, 22 UiO66 is formed by the coordination of zirco
niumoxo cluster with terephthalic acid where an octahedral cage shares its eight triangular faces with eight tetrahedral cages (Figure 
S1), each featuring a scale triangular aperture. The pore size of UiO66 is attractive to differentiate molecules and ions.
