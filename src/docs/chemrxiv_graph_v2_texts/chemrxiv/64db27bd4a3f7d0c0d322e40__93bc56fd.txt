Description:
The atom carrying the diazo group, influenced by electron-withdrawing or electron-donating functional groups.

For instance, Ariafard et al.31 ex
plored the R2 substitution impact, whereas the R1 site
is decorated by a few phenyl derivatives. In this case,
the activation barriers ranged from 26.7 to 35.1 kcalmol. Clearly, the direct attachment of electronwithdrawing or
electrondonating functional groups to the carbon carry
ing the diazo group, i.e. R1 site, will result in a more
pronounced electronic effect and, subsequently, can ex
ert a greater influence on the stability of the transition
structure. Moreover, a substantial portion of the stud
ies is devoted to the mechanism underlying the release of
N2 from diazo compounds in the presence of a catalyst,
particularly a metal complex catalyst 33, 3741.
