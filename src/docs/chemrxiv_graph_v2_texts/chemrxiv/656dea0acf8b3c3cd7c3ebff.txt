Description:
Strands that can be formed through catalyzed reactions.

Text:
Yet, because the freeenergy barrier of the PO formation is very high, the
reaction should be catalyzed, and there is no abiotic catalyst (i.e., not an enzyme) known to
date that can lead to strands longer than a few nucleotides.4
Experimental approaches, mainly performed in trialanderror strategies, have identied
possible activating groups and catalysts for the reaction between phosphate and a hydroxyl
group;712 however, the molecular mechanism of the reaction remains debated,13,14 and a
better comprehension would help rationalize the design of better conditions for ecient syn
