Meanwhile, the exploration of the NaSn system revealed the astonishing structural variety of 
the compounds with opened tin frameworks, acknowledging the versatility of the SnSn bond. 13 Depending on the atomic ratio NaSn, the dimensionality of the tin network in binary phases 
can vary from zero to threedimensional (0 to 3D), and the SnSn bonding ranges from 
localized twocentertwoelectron (2c2e) bonds to purely metallic bond. On the Narich side, 
the charge transfer from Na to Sn is often enough to allow the Sn anions to achieve the octet as 
isolated species. But in the Snrich side, the Sn atoms are forced to form bonds to each other, 
resulting in polyanionic tin subunits with opened frameworks having various connectivity and 
bond types.

Description:
A formally Zintl phase with predominant localized 2e2c bonds.

Hence, twodimensional tin networks are found for the phases Na7Sn12 14 and NaSn2 
15 featuring the polyanions 2
Sn127 and 2
Sn84, respectively, which are separated by layers 
of sodium cations. Finally, a threedimensional tin network is found in Na5Sn13 16 with open 
tunnel structure, and in the Sn richest phase NaSn5 17 with both  and Sn structural motif in 
which the Na atoms are located in cages with the shape deriving from a pentagonal
dedocahedron. Localized 2e2c bonds are predominant in the formally Zintl phases NaSn, 18
