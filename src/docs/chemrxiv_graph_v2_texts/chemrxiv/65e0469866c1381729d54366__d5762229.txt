Description:
Enhances ductility in Mg alloys.

Text:
Similar toxic responses were reported in the past for Li 6 
and Co7. Therefore, developing Mg alloys with physiologically present elements like Zinc 
(Zn) and Calcium (Ca), as bioimplants could be a desirable solution8. Several studies proposed Al and Rare Earth elements free Mg alloys like MgCa9 and Mg
Zn10. The addition of Ca enhances ductility, while zinc improves corrosion resistance. The 
combination of these elements, calcium, and zinc, has been observed to refine grain 
structure and enhance mechanical properties11. Similarly, the addition of other elements like 
Mn and Si can result in mechanically improved alloy system although they have not 
undergone evaluations for cytotoxicity12.
