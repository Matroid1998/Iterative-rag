Description:
A product of electrochemical water and CO2 reduction.

Impacts on global climate and environmental decay are increasingly evident as consequences of 
human activities1. Mitigating these effects will ultimately be underpinned by the transition to 
sustainable means of energy harvesting and consumption, within which electrochemical technologies 
stand to play a critical role24. Widespread adoption of electrochemical water and CO2 reduction to 
form H2 or Cbased fuels is hampered by the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 
thus, much work in the field is dedicated towards OER catalyst discovery5. To this end, mixedmetal 
oxides have emerged as the top class of materials for this reaction in alkaline conditions6.
