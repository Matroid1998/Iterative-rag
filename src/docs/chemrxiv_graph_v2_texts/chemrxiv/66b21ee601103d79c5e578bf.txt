Description:
Nanostructures with outstanding physicochemical properties, such as high resilience and low density.

Text:
For this reason, 
research is very active towards the development of nanocomposites whereby the presence of 
nanofillers could provide further advantages, such as increased resistance against applied stress, and 
higher stiffness.3 To this end, carbon nanostructures bear great potential, not only for their 
outstanding physicochemical properties, such as high resilience and low density, but also for the 
possibility to introduce additional properties.

Description:
Forms anisotropic carbon nanotubes ideal for creating stiff hydrogels with peptide fibrils.

Text:
In particular, the anisotropic morphology of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), was found to 
be ideal to yield a hybrid matrix with peptide fibrils, providing hydrogels with a remarkable increase in 
stiffness, especially in the case of doublewalled CNTs.10 Besides, also quasispherical carbon nano
onions (CNOs), which are concentric fullerene nanoparticles, could improve the stiffness of the peptide 
gels, although to a lower extent.11 Importantly, oxidized CNOs were found to noncovalently interact 
with the selfassembling peptide molecules, without interfering with their ability to stack and fibrillate 
for gelation, whilst effectively inhibiting fibrils bundling into fibers. As a result, in the presence of 
oxidized CNOs, peptide selfassembly yielded a gelling network of thinner fibrils that were better 
interconnected, thus more resistant against gel rupture due to applied stress.
