Description:
A cost-effective metal considered for use in catalysis and environmental technologies.

Text:
The use of costeffective metals such as transition cobalt,
zinc, nickel, copper, molybdenum hybrid materials, and so fourth have been extensively considered 1517 in
both catalysis and environmental technologies. Porous materials, such as intelligent as zeolite materials recently
are fully regarded as powerfully active catalysts in a wide range of catalysis technologies. Indeed, as explained in
Zhangas work 18, It covering a deep range of pore sizes starting from micropores (D  2 nm), mesopores (2
 D  50 nm) to macropores ( D  50 nm), so zeolite materials are versatile and essential in applications such as
gas separators, ion exchangers technology, catalysts, for energy holding, in sensor, and beyond. Also, the use of
zeolites on multicomponent reactions is introduced in Limas work 19.
