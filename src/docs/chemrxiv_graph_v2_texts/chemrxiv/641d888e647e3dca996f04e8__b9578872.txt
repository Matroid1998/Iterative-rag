Description:
Introduced between layers in zeolite precursors to increase the number of Si members in the ring limiting the pores.

While zeolites typically crystallize as threedimensional (3D) fully connected framework materials,4 
called tectosilicates when silica based,5 there exist examples of layered zeolite precursors that only 
form the final zeolite by a postsynthetic 2D3D topotactic condensation.6,7 The 2D layered precursors 
have been shown to also offer the opportunity to produce expanded versions of the corresponding 
zeolite by an intralayer expansion reaction of the layered precursor with a silylating agent.8,9,10 This 
reaction introduces Si atoms between the layers, thus increasing the number of Si members in the ring 
limiting the pores.11 The obtained materials are called Interlayered Expanded Zeolites (IEZ), although
we propose to use a different acronym, ILEZ, for reasons that will be obvious below.
