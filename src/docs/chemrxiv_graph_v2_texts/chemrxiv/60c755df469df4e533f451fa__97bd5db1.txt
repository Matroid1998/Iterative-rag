Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries that underpin the market for portable electronics and electric vehicles.

Text:
The transition from legacy fossil fuels to lowcarbon energy sources requires efficient 
means of storing the energy captured from intermittent renewable sources.1 Lithiumion 
batteries currently underpin the market for portable electronics and electric vehicles, but 
their use for gridscale integration remains limited.

Description:
An element that alloys with silicon, causing volume expansion and affecting battery capacity.

Further improvement of energy 
density (with respect to both mass and volume) is needed, and much attention is currently 
being directed to a wide range of materials for both the cathode and anode.24 For anodes, 
one material of great interest is silicon that has a theoretical capacity of 3579 mAhg1, 
based upon the formation of Li15Si4, which is almost an order of magnitude higher than 
that of graphite, the most commonly used anode in commercial batteries.5,6 The capacity 
retention of silicon, however, is poor over several hundred cycles and thus far has seen 
only limited deployment.7,8 The volume expansion of 300 upon alloying silicon with 
lithium9 results in pulverization of the material and formation of freshly cleaved Si 
surfaces, which react with the electrolyte, resulting in the formation of new solid 
electrolyte interphase (SEI).10 Progressive fracturing and formation of SEI eventually 
result in disconnection of active Si, degrading the capacity.1114 Various strategies have 
been employed to mitigate fracture and disconnection, such as optimizing electrolyte 
composition,1517 including binders and conductive carbon additives,1820 as well as 
adding protective surface layers encapsulating the silicon.2124 Other strategies include 
changing the Si morphology to nanowires,2527 reducing the particle size to less than 100 
nm,2830 and introducing porosity to better accommodate volume expansion.3135 
Targeted efforts to reduce fracture and improve capacity retention require an 
understanding of the alloying processes that occur as the voltage is lowered towards 0 V 
vs Li during lithiation and as the voltage is raised again during delithiation.
