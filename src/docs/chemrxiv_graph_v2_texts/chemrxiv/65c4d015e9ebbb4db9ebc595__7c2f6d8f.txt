Description:
Involved in CH bond activation reactions with alkane complexes.

Text:
Alkane complexes play a critical role in CH bond activation 
reactions with transition metal complexes. They constitute the 
decisive intermediates in which an alkane CH bond directly 
coordinates and interacts with the transition metal13. Due to 
their low polarizability, however, alkanes are generally poor 
electron donors and acceptors. The bond strength between the 
metal and the alkane CH bond in complexes is therefore typ
ically very weak. Still, the subtle degree of polarization induced 
in the CH bond through binding to the metal site in complex 
intermediates critically determines the reactivity towards bond 
cleavage in CH activation reactions4.
