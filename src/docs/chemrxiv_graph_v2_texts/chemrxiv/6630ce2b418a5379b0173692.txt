Description:
Contained in MOFs for composite materials.

Text:
There are many 
kinds of composites, including mixedmatrix membranes,9 silica
MOF composites,10 MOFs coated with oxides11 and graphene 
oxide containing MOFs.12 A common issue with compositing, 
however, is a reduction in the chemical and physical efficacy of 
the resultant material. In addition, composites in general are 
highly sensitive to the nature of the interface. A new family of MOF composites has recently been reported, 
in which MOF crystallites are embedded in an inorganic glass 
matrix.
