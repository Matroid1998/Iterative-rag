Description:
Reacts with diphenylphosphine in the presence of tritertbutylphosphine to form compound 1.

Results and Discussion 
23

Treatment of a THF solution of copper(I) chloride with potassium diphe
24

nylphosphide in the presence of tritertbutylphosphine at 30 C results in the formation 
25

of compound 1 (eq. 1) as determined by single crystal Xray diffraction, 1H, 31P, 13C NMR, 
26

and 31P HMBC NMR spectroscopy. Compound 1 can also be synthesized by treatment of 
27

mesitylcopper(I) with diphenylphosphine in the presence of tritertbutylphosphine (eq. 28

2 of 7 

2) or by treatment of Cu(acac)2 with three equivalents of diphenylphosphine in the pres
29

ence of tritertbutylphosphine (eq. 3). The 1H and 31P NMR spectra of products from these 
30

three methods are equivalent. 31
