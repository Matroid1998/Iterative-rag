Description:
Used to create micropatterns on surfaces of polymers and rigid dielectrics through laser activation and chemical reduction.

Text:
Methods of maskless direct laser writing are considered as a promising 
alternative to the traditional lithography and other existing technologies for production of the 
microelectronic components, sensors and other devices 24. Laserassisted methods can be 
divided into two groups. The first group includes technologies, in which laser radiation is used as 
a preliminary activation or sensitization of the surface. For example, selective surface activation 
induced by laser (SSAIL) is among these methods, in which it is possible to create copper 
micropatterns on almost any surface of polymers and rigid dielectrics using laser activation by ps 
pulses and subsequent chemical reduction process 57. Another example from the first group 
is laser activation with simultaneous chemical sensibilization of the surface using organic
