Description:
Nanoparticles hold potential for imaging, sensing, and degradation of reactive oxygen species.

Text:
Due to the readily interchangeable 
oxidation states of Mn and Fe atoms in the crystal structure, we observed a strong dependence of the 
magnetic properties on H2O2 exposure, which could be exploited for sensing. This enables, for the first 
time, the sensing of reactive oxygen species based on magnetic particle spectroscopy and imaging, with 
sensitivity down to 25 M H2O2 and complete sensor recovery over time. In summary, Mnferrite 
nanoparticles hold promising potential for imaging, sensing, and the degradation of diseaserelevant 
reactive oxygen species. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025b676k ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000230186796 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
