Description:
A compound with throughputs of up to 195 mg per hour in photochemical flow synthesis.

Text:
Flow or photoflow methodologies are an oftenoverlooked 
synthetic strategy for accessing heterohelicenes. In particular, 
photoflow chemistry may offer advantages over batch 
chemistry including straightforward scalability and a higher 
tolerance for the high dilution and potential photodegradation 
encountered in Mallory photocyclisations.47,48 Some examples 
of helicenes and heterohelicenes synthesised in flow have been 
reported such as the 222 cycloisomerisations mentioned 
above, but only a handful of these explore the preparation of 
heterohelicenes by photocyclisation.4953 
In this work, we report the Mallory photocyclisation of a 
series of heterohelicenes using a photochemical flow reactor. Most substrates were synthesised within a short 100 s 
residence time by using a powerful 150 W LED 365 nm lamp, 
enabling throughputs of up to 195 mg of stilbene per hour.
