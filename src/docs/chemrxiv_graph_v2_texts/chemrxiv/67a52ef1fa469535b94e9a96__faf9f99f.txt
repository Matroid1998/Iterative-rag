Description:
A value-added hydrocarbon with high industrial potential.

Text:
of gold nano cluster as cocatalyst with TiO2 nano cluster reduces the energy gap for 
CC coupling reaction step in ethane formation reaction. The CH activation reaction on Au6TiO2 nano cluster, the 
reaction energy is almost the same as that on the bare TiO2 nano cluster. The final desorption energy of free ethane from 
the adsorbed surface is less in case Au6TiO2 nano cluster compared to TiO2 nano cluster. Introduction 
Methane (CH4), the chief constituent of natural gas and 
byproduct of oil recovery is a major contributor to 
global warming almost 25 times stronger than that of 
CO2.There has been increased drive on research for the 
direct conversion of CH4 to valueadded hydrocarbons 
with high industrial potential like methanol (CH3OH), 
ethanol (CH3CH2OH), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4) 
etc.
