Description:
A compound used as a side chain in polymers.

We further
demonstrate that the doping induced charges oscillate
in space upon geometry displacement along the vibra
tional normal modes with highest intensities in the IR
spectrum.25 The nearinfrared optical absorption spec
trum of the complex contains the typical features of intra
molecular polaron excitations which in our calculations
are distinct from the lowintensity intermolecular charge
transfer excitations also observed. II. SYSTEM AND METHODS
The OSC studied in this work is a bithiophene
thienothiophene copolymer p(g42TTT) for which double
doping was recently demonstrated experimentally.16 To
reduce the computational cost, the tetraethylene glycol
side chains are replaced by methoxy groups (Figure 1a). In the present study the OSC is described by a nite
length oligomer consisting of three repeat units.
