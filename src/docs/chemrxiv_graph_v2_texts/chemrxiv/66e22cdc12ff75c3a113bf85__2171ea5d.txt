Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), known for their highly 
ordered structures and exceptional versatility, have been 
investigated as key materials in a wide array of biomedical 
applications.14 Their unique properties featuring tuneable pore 
sizes, high surface areas, and inherent stability, makes MOFs 
ideal candidates for innovative solutions this area.1 The 
frameworks have been previously used as carriers for the 
delivery of DNA and proteins, where the tuneable pore size of 
the MOFs allows for the loading of high dosage, while their 
inherent stability ensures that the payload is released in a 
controlled manner.5 MOFs have been used as high sensitivity 
biosensors, with high surface area playing a key role in providing 
extensive binding sites for the immobilization of analytes.6 
Concomitantly, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are very 
popular cell models.7 These sizable liposomes are important for 
studying 
membrane 
biophysics, 
interactions 
between 
membrane molecules, anion transport, and drug delivery for 
advanced therapeutics.8 Studies have reported MOF liposome 
assemblies that include but are not limited to the use of lipid
coated MOF nanoparticles,9,10 liposomes encapsulated in 
MOFs,11,12 MOFs embedded in lipid membranes of liposomes,13 
and the use of MOFs with lipid functionalized surfaces.14 
In recent literature, waterstable functionalized Hf and Zr 
MOFs embedded within liposome bilayer demonstrated the 
potential of sustainable energy production by facilitating 
photocatalytic splitting of water into H2 and O2 by sunlight 
irradiation.
