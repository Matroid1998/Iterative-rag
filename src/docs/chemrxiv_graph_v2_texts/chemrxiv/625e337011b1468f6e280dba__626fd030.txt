Therefore, it is necessary to understand the 
fundamental physical properties of TMAO. The biophysical chemistry and solution dynamics of aqueous TMAO solutions have been 
extensively investigated from experimental514 viewpoints. Vibrational and nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy indicated that both the NO and CH3 groups of TMAO slow the 
dynamics of water molecules in a solution and that the NO groups have a notable ability to 
capture water molecules.57, 10, 11, 13 Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are 
essential for explaining the experimental results precisely, because of the fluctuating polarization 
interactions in the aggregated systems. Although there have been several subpicosecondorder 
AIMD simulations,1520 there have been no nanosecondorder AIMD simulations while 
reproducing the TMAO concentration and diffusion coefficients of water in deepsea fishes.
