Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding, which is crucial for protein structure and folding.

Text:
Proteins are remarkably complex macromolecules with specific functionality. The ultimate 
principle in protein science is that amino acid sequence impacts the structure which in turn enables 
function.15 Protein structure and folding requires a combination of hydrophobic interactions, 
electrostatics, and hydrogen bonding.2, 4, 6, 7 A key requirement is dehydration whereby 
hydrophobic amino acids form a hydrophobic core surrounded by solventaccessible amino acids.
