Description:
Used in adsorption studies to assess pore volume and structure.

Text:
Direct 
comparison of this N2 adsorption data with that of the previously prepared PUNCCocbipyCo (Fig. 1c; SABET  845, Vmp  0.44 ml g1) indicates that the TPP guest molecules occupy around 50 of the 
free volume of the basic PNC structure (Fig. 3a). The modest uptake of CO2 at 273K by 
PUNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP (Fig. 5b) suggests that only a small fraction of the total pore volume 
is distributed as ultramicropores, defined as pores of less than 7  in diameter, which is consistent 
with the crystal structure of the PNC, for which only the narrow channels linking the voids are 
ultramicroporous.
