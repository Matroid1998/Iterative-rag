In our opinion, one of the most efficient and straightforward 
reactions, needed to be developed for the synthesis of seven
membered carbocycles, is the transition metalcatalyzed 
421 cycloaddition of dieneenesdieneynesdieneallenes 
and carbon monoxide (CO), considering that these substrates 
are readily accessible and CO is cheap and abundant.3 However, 
realization of this reaction has obstacles, since 42, 221 
cycloadditions and other side reactions could overwhelm the 
desired 421 cycloaddition. It was reported by Wender and 
coworkers4 that the 221 reactions were usually the 
outcomes for the reactions of dieneenesdieneynesdiene
allenes and CO under the rhodium catalysis.
