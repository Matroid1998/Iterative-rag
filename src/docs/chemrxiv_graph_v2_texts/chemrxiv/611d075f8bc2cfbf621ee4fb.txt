Description:
Forms a monolayer that can be affected by polyvalent ions in solution.

Text:
has revealed that a trace amount of 
polyvalent ions in solution can compete with the ion of interest for adsorption sites and cause 
variations in the vibrational pattern of the fatty acid monolayer.26 While the impact of 
organic impurities included in the salts used had been previously demonstrated,24, 27 the 
latter study showed that trace amounts of polyvalent metal impurities, such as trivalent ions, 
must also be considered when investigating binding to a charged interface.26 
Studies of trivalent cation binding are challenging due to the limitations in predicting their 
speciation in aqueous solutions and their complex electronic structures.
