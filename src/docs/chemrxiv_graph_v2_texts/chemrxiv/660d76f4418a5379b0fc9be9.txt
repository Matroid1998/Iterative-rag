Derivatives of azobenzene enable the use of light as a non
invasive stimulus to control the properties of matter on var
ious length scales.13 Among many other applications, pho
toswitches based on the NN double bond motif hold signif
icant promise in energy storage technologies,4,5 provide 
possibilities to steer the target affinity of drug molecules,6,7 
or allow to control catalyst activity.811 Beyond that, 
azoarenes enable light control for the assembly of nano
sized building blocks into one (e.g., supramolecular poly
mers),1216 two (e.g., interfaces),1719 or threedimensional 
(e.g., micro or nanoparticle assemblies) matter.20,21 
In all cases, the underlying concept relies on the activation 
of the E azo double bond into its Z form,22 which is associ
ated with significant changes of the molecules shape and 
dipole moment.
