Description:
Octahedral atoms in the spinel structure.

Text:
(a) Front
view of spinel with tetrahedral Zn atoms (grey) between layers of oc
tahedral Fe atoms (orange) and O anions (red). (b) 3D view of cubic
spinel. (c) Layers of closepacked O atoms with A (green) B (yellow) and
C (blue) layers highlighted. The view in (a) is transformed to the view
in (c) by rotation of 45 around the caxis followed by a rotation of 55
around the bisection of the aaxis and baxis perpendicular to the caxis. B3 cations occupy octahedral and tetrahedral sites respectively
with the two extremities shown in Figure 2. A fully normal struc
ture has all occupied tetrahedral sites consisting of A2 cations
and all occupied octahedral sites consisting of B3 cations.
