Description:
Influential in molecular chemistry and functional materials, used as ligands in metal complexes for catalysis and in organocatalysis.

Text:
Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have had a profound influence on both the development of molecular chemistry, and also 
partly functional materials in the past three decades. Their impact can be seen in a whole string of applications ranging 
from ligands in metal complexes for catalysis1 , as active components in organocatalysis2, in several aspects of material 
science3 or in medicinal chemistry4. Following the reports on neutral NHCs, anionic NHCs and their metal complexes

were reported as well. A new twist on the classical NHCs was presented by Robinson and coworkers in 2010 through the 
introduction of new kinds of anionic NHCs.5,6
