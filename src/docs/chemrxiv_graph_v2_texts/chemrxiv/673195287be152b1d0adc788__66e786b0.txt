Description:
A byproduct of organic substrate reactions and can be generated from biomass.

Nevertheless, these strategies to construct more complex organic 
compounds are more atom efficient  i) prefunctionalization of the organic substrates is avoided, ii) 
the byproducts are H2, H2O, CO2 andor other small molecules.21,22,23,15, 24 More promising is 
generation H2 from biomass, such as lignin, cellulose25 or pollutants.26 However, the yield rate of H2 is 
significantly lower compared to model small organic sacrificial molecules  glucose, and other sugars.27 
It is also of fundamental interest to expand the scope of dehydrogenation reactions and identify which 
of them are intrinsically endergonic, but are enabled by means of photochemistry and photocatalysis. In this case the energy of photons is stored in the organic products, while the reaction is regarded as 
artificial photosynthesis.28
