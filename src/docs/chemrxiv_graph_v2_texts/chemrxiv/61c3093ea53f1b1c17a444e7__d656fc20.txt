Description:
Involved in charge transfer interactions and can generate aryl radicals via photolysis of the CS bond.

Interest
ingly, the control experiment run in the absence of donor G delivered product 4 in 34 yield (entry 8). This result suggests that 
additional charge transfer interactions might be taking place (presumably between sulfonium salt 2 and silyl enol ether 3) or, 
alternatively, that the generation of aryl radicals via photolysis of the CS bond within 2 could be a competitive pathway, even at 
irradiation wavelengths outside of the UV region (vide infra, Figure 6a). Finally, the radical nature of the photochemical protocol 
was corroborated by the lack of product formation observed when the reaction was performed in the presence of radical scavenger 
TEMPO (entry 9). 3
