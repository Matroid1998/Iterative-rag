Description:
A product of the degradation of biodegradable polymers.

Text:
Biodegradable polymers can be degraded into carbon dioxide (CO2), water, biomass, and 
humus (dark organic matter in soil) using living organisms, photocatalysis, or catalysis. Biodegradation in a natural system is biologically benign using microorganisms or enzymes. The European standard of EN 13432 defined biodegradable materials as materials that can be 
degraded  90 of their mass via biological environment for six months. We introduce biodegradable polymers and the development of polymers nanocomposites. Here, we discuss biodegradable polymer nanocomposites dielectric, thermal, and electrical 
conductivity. The synthesis of polymer nanocomposites exhibits high electric and thermal 
conductivity with good dielectric properties. The properties of polymers can be improved via 
conjugation with inorganic and organic materials. 2. Biodegradable polymers 
The term biodegradable ensures products reliability in the environment without harmful 
effects.
