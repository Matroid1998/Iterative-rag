Description:
Used in alkyd resins, paints, coatings, and acrylate monomer compositions.

Text:
Numerous reports describe reaction of epichlorohydrin with 
carboxylates, particularly hindered carboxylates, as the 
ensuing glycidyl esters are used in alkyd resins, paints, 
coatings, and acrylate monomer compositions.5 Fewer 
reports detail the reaction of enantiopure epichlorohydrin 
with carboxylic acid derivatives.5ik This work describes 
development of a practical route to (S)glycidyl pivalate 
from lowcost and readily available (R)epichlorohydrin and 
pivalic acid.
