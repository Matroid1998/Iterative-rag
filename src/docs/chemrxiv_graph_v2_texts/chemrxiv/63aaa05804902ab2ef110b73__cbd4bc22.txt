Among nanosized drug delivery systems, liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles are the 
44 
bestknown and most widely used. Liposomes are spherical vesicular systems in which a core 
45 
structure is surrounded by one or more phospholipid layers. Thus, in a sense, they are primitive 
46 
versions of lipidbased drug delivery systems 1,2. They are fundamentally advantageous in 
47 
many ways; production costs are generally low and manufacturing methods are extremely 
48 
practical, to name a few. In this way, liposomebased products have been rapidly 
49 
commercialized and have gained acceptance in both academia and industry.
