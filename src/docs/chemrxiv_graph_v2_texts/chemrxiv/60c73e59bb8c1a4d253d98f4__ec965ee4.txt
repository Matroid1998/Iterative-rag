Description:
A homopolymer that exhibits hydrophobic collapse transitions at its lower critical solution temperature.

In particular, ionspecific, also
called Hofmeister effects2,3 of salts on biopolymeric structure
and phase behavior have been studied and highlighted in the re
cent years in an overwhelming amount of literature.48
The Hofmeister effects on the polymeric structure and the
phase behavior are very complex and polymer specific. In order
to increase the accessibility to the problem, often model systems
are employed. For instance, the polyNisopropylacrylamide
(PNIPAM) homopolymer or elastinlike polypeptides (ELPs),
which both exhibit hydrophobic collapse transitions at their re
spectivelowercriticalsolution temperatures(LCST).911 These
collapse transitions are analogous to colddenaturation of pro
teins, in which ionspecific interactions (Hofmeister effects)
play an prominent role.

Description:
A neutral polymer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at 32Â°C.

Text:
PNIPAM is neutral polymer with LCST at 32 C. Charge
groups can be introduced into the polymer structure by copoly
merization, typically with weak or strong acids or bases.1214
The electrostatic repulsion between charged monomers then
leads to an increase of LCST in pure water and a strong re
sponse to added salt at millimolar salt concentration when
charge screening sets in.
