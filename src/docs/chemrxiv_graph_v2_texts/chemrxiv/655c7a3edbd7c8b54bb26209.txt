Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to global warming and targeted for reduction in emissions.

Text:
Governments worldwide are pushing for the electrification of transport to reduce global CO2 emissions 
and mitigate global warming. For example, the UK government has announced a requirement that all 
new cars and vans will be required to be fully zero emission at the tailpipe by 2035 and similar 
strategies are being adopted worldwide.1 This transition requires the development of a strategy to 
efficiently recycle the large number of spent lithiumion batteries (LIBs) that reach the end of their 
service lifetime.
