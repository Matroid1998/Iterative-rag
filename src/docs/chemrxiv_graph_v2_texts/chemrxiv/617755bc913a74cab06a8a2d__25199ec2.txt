Description:
Naturally occurring compounds in magic mushrooms that act as agonists of 5-hydroxy tryptamine 2A receptors.

Text:
Psilocybin and psilocin are indole alkaloids found in a variety of mushroomforming 
fungi commonly referred to in North America as magic mushrooms. These alkaloid 
indoles are naturally occurring agonists of 5hydroxy tryptamine 2A receptors located in 
the mammalian nervous system. In humans, the compounds cause a variety of 
psychotropic effects which can include altered states of consciousness and perception in 
addition to auditory and visual hallucinations with minimal systemic effects (Passie et al., 
2002; Daniel and Haberman, 2017).
