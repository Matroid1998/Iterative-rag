Description:
A chemical reductant used stoichiometrically in radical deoxygenation reactions.

Text:
Such derivatizations facilitate 
reductions, nucleophilic substitutions, transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling reactions, etc., in 
both a twoelectron polar setting and a radical manifold (Figure 1, top right).59 For selective deletion 
of hydroxyl groups to furnish alkane products, the radical BartonMcCombie deoxygenation is still 
widely used, relying on derivatization of the alcohols to xanthate esters and stoichiometric use of 
chemical reductants such as tributyltin hydride or silanes.1012 In recent years, the prefunctionalization 
of alcohols into carboxylic esters, such as oxalate, toluate and benzoate, has gained attention as 
enabling strategy for deoxygenative transformations in a radical setting.1317 Similarly, in situ formation 
of activated alcohol derivatives using e.g.
