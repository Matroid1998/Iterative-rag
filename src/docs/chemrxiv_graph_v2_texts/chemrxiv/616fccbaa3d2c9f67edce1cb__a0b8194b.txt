of fluorine into organic 
molecules often strongly affects their properties, including their polarity, solubility, and 
lipophilicity. Among many organic fluorinecontaining compounds, fluorinated arenes 
are used as semiconductors, lightemitting materials, and liquid crystals6. Owing to its 
negative inductive effect, the incorporation of fluorine into materials leads to a 
decrease in orbital energy. As such, it is important to develop synthetic methods that 
provide access to aromatic molecules containing many CF bonds79, and the extreme 
targets of the research field are aromatic molecules wherein all hydrogen atoms are 
replaced with fluorine atoms, i.e., perfluoroarenes1014. However, methods to 
synthesize strained perfluoroarenes remain very limited. It is known that various 
fluorinated fullerenes (Fig.
