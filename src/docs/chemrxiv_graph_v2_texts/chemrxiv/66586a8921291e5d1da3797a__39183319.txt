Description:
Doubly-iodo-substituted acetylene can form tetracations.

However, the ISM is still a harsh place for molecules cosmic radiation from various sources provides highenergy
photons that can provide single and multiple ionization of the molecular species.14 For instance, if a PAH molecule
will absorb an extreme UV or soft Xray photon, this can lead up to triple ionization with a production of a stable
trication andor to fragmentation.3, 57 Therefore, molecular mono and polycations can exist in the ISM, serving as
intermediates in different chemical reactions and generating new molecular species.8 The potential role of multiply
charged ions in the production of complex molecules can be crucial since the rates of ionneutral reactions grow linearly
with the increase of the ionic charge.9
Over the years, many experimental results were obtained in investigating molecular polycations.10, 11 For in
stance, dications were detected in space, in the tails of comets,12 trications of PAHs were produced with highenergy
photons,6 by abovethreshold ionization (ATI), and also by interaction with highlycharged xenon ions.13 The quest
for molecular tetracations started with the highpower ATI by femtosecond intense laser pulses, which led to the labo
ratory detection of tetracations of PAHs,14 substituted benzene,15 and even doublyiodosubstituted acetylene.16
Intact tetracations of PAHs were also found in highenergy collisions of neutral PAH molecules with various ions.17
However, to our knowledge, no existing model provides a general description of the stability of polycations.
