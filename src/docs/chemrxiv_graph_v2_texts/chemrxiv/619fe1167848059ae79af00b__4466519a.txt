Description:
Can be intercalated reversibly in vanadium pentoxide to achieve high theoretical capacity.

Improvements in lithiumion based rechargeable batteries are essential for new technological 
developments and lowcarbon energy technologies. Faster chargedischarge times, better 
capacity retention, and recycling are all under investigation, both in incumbent and new 
materials technologies.1 Energy density is currently limited by the capacity of the cathode 
material2 and in this regard, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is an interesting candidate as it can 
achieve a theoretical capacity of 440 mAhg provided three lithium ions (Li) can be 
intercalated reversibly per unit cell.3 A recent study by Liu et al.
