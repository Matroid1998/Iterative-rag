Description:
Used as a model substrate in density functional theory calculations.

To gain insight into the detailed reaction mechanism and the or
igins of chirality control of the extremely bulky DTBANIPE lig
and, we obtained the Xray crystal structure of Pd(L7)(3cin)Cl 
(Figure 2C). Based on this Xray crystal structure, density func
tional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using 2
chloronaphthalene 1a and benzylic zinc reagent 2a as model sub
strates (see the Supporting Information for the computational de
tails). The DFTcomputed free energy profile is elaborated in Fig
ure 2D. Based on previous theoretical studies14,15, the reaction ini
tiates with the coordination of 1a to PdL7, resulting in the com
plex int1.
