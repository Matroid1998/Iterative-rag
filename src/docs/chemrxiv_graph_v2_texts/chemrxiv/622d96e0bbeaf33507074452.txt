Description:
Inhibits transverse vibrations responsible for negative thermal expansion in CoFe(CN)5NO.

Text:
By way of example, inclusion of
CO2 in CoFe(CN)5NO continuously tunes the thermal
expansion from 6 to 8 MK1, as the gas inhibits the
transverse vibrations responsible for NTE.11 This type of
guestinduced NTE suppression is frequently observed in
framework materials with phonondriven NTE,1215 al
though guestenhanced expansion is also possible.16 In
either case, guest inclusion in porous solids is an impor
tant tool towards the control of thermal expansion, which
is relevant for diverse applications ranging from e.g. high
precision optics to cookware.17
Most studies on the guestdependent thermal be
haviour of MOFs have focussed on microporous MOFs,
e.g.
