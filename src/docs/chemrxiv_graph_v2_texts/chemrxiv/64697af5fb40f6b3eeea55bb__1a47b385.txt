point defects (e.g., nitrogen vacancies) and impurities (e.g., in
corporated oxygen) that strongly influence their functional prop
erties, even when present in subpercent levels. For exam
ple, defectmediated nonradiative recombination (Figure 1e) re
duces the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of optoelectronic
devices.24,25 Therefore, the investigation of native defects and
unintentional impurities is crucial for developing defect control
strategies with the ultimate goal of optimizing alloy functional
properties.26
However, systematic interrogation of such point defects and
impurities is complicated by their low concentrations relative to
atomic sites, requiring sophisticated metrology (e.g., deep level
transient spectroscopy, timeresolved photoluminescence, elec
tron paramagnetic resonance) to derive indirect evidence.
