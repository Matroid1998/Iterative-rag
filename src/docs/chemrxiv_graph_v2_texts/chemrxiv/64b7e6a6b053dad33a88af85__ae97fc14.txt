Description:
A component of ternary C2H2C2H6C2H4 mixtures that is challenging to trap selectively.

Text:
Because of the difficulty in designing and 
synthesizing materials that preferentially trap C2H2 and C2H6, 
simultaneous removal of both C2H2 and C2H6 from ternary 
C2H2C2H6C2H4 mixtures in a onestep process is still under
explored. Besides, the reported MOF and HOF adsorbents 
generally suffer from poor chemical stability, high cost and 
unscalable products, which hamper their practical applications. Thus, 
developing 
inexpensive 
and 
chemically 
robust 
adsorbents with excellent C2gases mixture separation 
properties is urgently needed for the industrial purification of 
C2H4.

Description:
A component that can be efficiently removed from binary C2H2C2H4 mixtures using 3D COFs with bcu topology.

Text:
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class 
of organic porous crystalline materials based on light elements 
interconnected through covalent bonds.2125 Attributed to their 
predictable structures, high porosity, tunable pore sizes and 
high chemical stability, COFs have shown unique properties 
and great potential in gas storage and separation applica
tions.2630 Many experiments have been devoted to purity 
C2H4 from C2gases mixtures. In 2018, Zhu and coworkers 
used imidelinked COFs (PAF110) to purity C2H4 from bina
ry C2H2C2H4 mixtures.31 Recently, our group reported that 
threedimensional (3D) COFs with bcu topology could effi
ciently remove C2H6 from binary C2H2C2H4 mixtures to pro
duce polymergrade C2H4.
