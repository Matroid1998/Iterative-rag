Description:
Formed through enantioselective SNAr cyclization and are inherently chiral, conformationally rigid medium-sized heterocycles.

e The choice of 
disconnection dictates the degree of substrate preorganization in cyclization reactions, and therefore their feasibility in the forward sense. f Initial 
reaction optimization for the enantioselective SNAr cyclization to form dibenzodiazepinones. Notwithstanding the great potential that inherently chiral, conformationally rigid medium
sized heterocycles hold for drug development, their manufacture is hampered by the intrinsic 
synthetic challenge that they pose, particularly during the ringforming step. In addition, achieving 
configurationally stable products requires the cyclization of precursors with sterically demanding 
groups, adding to the ring strain of the targets (16, 17). This strain creates a competition for 
intermolecular oligomerization, jeopardizing the formation of monomeric cyclized products 
(Figure 1b, top row).
