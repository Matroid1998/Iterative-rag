Description:
A CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for cancer therapy, targeting the retinoblastoma protein.

Text:
42 
CDKs are a crucial class of enzymes belonging to the highly conserved SerThr kinase family, regulating 
43 
cell cycle progression in solid tumors by forming catalytically active heterodimeric complexes with cyclins 
44 
and controlling essential processes such as apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation13. Among these 
45 
kinases, CDK4 and its close analog CDK6 have been the most extensively studied due to their critical role 
46 
in the G1 phase and G1S transition of the cell cycle. CDK46 inhibitors, such as palbociclib (Pzer)4, 
47 
ribociclib (Novartis)5, and abemaciclib (Eli Lilly)6, have been developed and approved for cancer therapy 
48 
due to their selective inhibition of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a growth suppressor protein frequently 
49 
deregulated in cancer patients7,8.

Description:
Carries a higher risk of grade 3 or grade 4 hematological toxicity.

Text:
Consequently, palbociclib and ribociclib carry a higher risk 
63 
of grade 3 or grade 4 hematological toxicity,13 while abemaciclib, associated with hematologic toxicity, 
64 
occurs less frequently, allowing for continuous dosing due to its enhanced selectivity index of CDK4 over 
65 
CDK646,13. Therefore, developing a CDK inhibitor that selectively targets CDK4 while sparing CDK6
