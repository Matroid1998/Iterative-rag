Description:
An example of a heterohelicene with a double-layered structure.

Text:
Therefore, it is more difficult to syn
thesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, 
whereas several heterohelicenes with a doublelayered 
structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri
oxa13helicene D.12) Furthermore, a triplelayered struc
ture was accomplished with oxanhelicene E (n  17, 19) 
albeit with disrupted conjugation.13) To qualitatively eval
uate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is 
necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated het
erohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic 
strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispen
sable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are 
available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.
