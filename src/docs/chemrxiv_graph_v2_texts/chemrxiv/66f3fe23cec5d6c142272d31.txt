Since 2020, the flash Joule heating (FJH) method has regarded as an effective
45
approach to convert solid carbon into turbostratic flash graphene in seconds under the
46
combined action of high temperature and electric field.1417 In the FJH process, the
47
capacitor tank can discharge instantaneously at approximately 400 V and 1000 A,
48
delivering 400 kW of power to heat a 1.0gram solid carbon sample to over 3000 C
49
in milliseconds.14 By 2023, a smallbatch automatic FJH system capable of loading
50
5.7 grams of metallurgical coke per batch had been designed, with a production
51
capacity of 1.1 kg of graphene in 1.5 hour.18 Scaling up this automatic FJH system to
52
produce larger batches of graphene requires additional capacitors.
