Description:
Exhibits improved photocatalytic activity when metallized.

Text:
It is necessary that one recalls the repeated reports in literature 
on the improvement of photocatalytic activity due to metallization of TiO29. In a recent publication, Wu et al10 reported studies on TiO2 single crystals with different percentages of001 facets and have shown the 
35 
higher is the percentage of 001 facets, the higher photooxidation reactivity and possibly also dependent of the size of the crystal. They postulate that this may be one of the important criterion for many of the oxides in photocatalytic processes. The Energetics of Heterojunction of Titania 
The energetics of this heterojunction has been considered by Deak et al11.
