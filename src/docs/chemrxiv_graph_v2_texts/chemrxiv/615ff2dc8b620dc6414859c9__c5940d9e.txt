Description:
An efficient photosensitizer building block in transition metal complexes.

Artificial photosynthesis aims to develop photocatalytic systems for lightdriven water splitting.1 
Promising structures are molecular assemblies combining a lightharvesting and a redoxactive 
catalytic unit, which are chemically linked by a molecular bridge.2 Such molecularly defined systems 
offer the opportunity for detailed, mechanistic investigations upon structural modifications. From 
various studies, transition metal complexes, i.e., based on RuII, IrIII, OsII or ReI emerged as efficient 
photosensitizer buildingbocks.2,3 However, to strive for sustainable photocatalysis it is mandatory to 

replace noblemetal sensitizers by lowcost and easy to derivatize organic chromophores such as 
oligothiophene4,5 and rylene6,7 dyes.
