Description:
An element involved in carbon capture processes such as Direct Ocean Capture.

Text:
Some of these approaches switch the oxidation state 
of redoxactive molecules for direct CO2 adsorption and desorption, while others are based on pH 
changes induced by redox reactions. The latter includes Direct Ocean Capture, which is an indirect 
form of carbon capture.11 It removes dissolved CO2 from seawater, which is then reabsorbed to 
the seawater from the air. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024xb82b ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000161704704 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
