Description:
Forms the basis of carbon nanotubes, which are cylindrical structures made of sp2-bonded carbon atoms.

Text:
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical structures made of sp2bonded carbon atoms with 
diameters ranging from 0.7 to 100 nm and lengths up to several micrometres.1,2,3 CNT 
membranes consist of aligned or randomly oriented CNTs forming a network of nanopores that 
enables selective transport of molecules.4,5 CNT membranes have several advantages over 
conventional membranes, such as high permeability, low fouling, high thermal and mechanical 
stability, and tunable selectivity.6,7 They have attracted considerable attention for various 
applications, such as water treatment,8 desalination,9,10 chemical separation,11 and energy 
storage12.
