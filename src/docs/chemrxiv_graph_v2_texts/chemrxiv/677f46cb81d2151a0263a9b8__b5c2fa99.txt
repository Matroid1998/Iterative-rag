Description:
Produced from direct methane conversion without intermediate syngas production.

However, this process 
is energy intensive and generates carbonaceous deposits (coke), leading to catalyst deactivation.15, 
16 In addition, the subsequent FischerTropsch process requires either CO or H2 to remove oxygen 
from CO, reducing the carbon atom utilization efficiency or consuming valuable H2 resources. Thus, direct methane conversion to multicarbon hydrocarbons operating at mild conditions 
without going through the intermediate syngas production is more economically and 
environmentally desirable.
