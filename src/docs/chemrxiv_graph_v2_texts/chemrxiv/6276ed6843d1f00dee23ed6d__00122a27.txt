Description:
Involved in Ni catalysis with potential insights into SRRs and mechanism.

Text:
A handful of computational studies have 
included Buchwald phosphines in their analyses, but the focus 
was not on the ligand class specifically.26,27 Nicasio and 
coworkers have structurally characterized dialkylterphenyl 
phosphines on Ni; these ligands share certain attributes with 
Buchwaldtype ligands.2830 However, to the best of our 
knowledge, only one example exists in the literature of a 
structurallycharacterized Ni complex bound by a Buchwald 
phosphine an offcycle, cyclometalated adduct of BrettPhos 
formed during the crosscoupling of styrenyl epoxides.18 Given 
the scarcity of relevant studies, insights into the SRRs and 
mechanism of Buchwald and CataCXium P phosphines in Ni 
catalysis, along with access to welldefined Ni complexes 
bearing these ligands, would be of great value both in the 
discovery of new methodologies and in the further 
understandingoptimization of existing ones.
