constructed a highly 
helical BN9helicene, exhibiting a high glum of 5.8103 with an orange emission peaking at 
575 nm and an FWHM of 47 nm.12 Albeit those preliminary works, devising B,NMR hetero
helicenes that balance the dissymmetry factor and the photoluminescence quantum yield 
remains a formidable challenge, not to mention that most previous reported helicenes always 
exhibited wide emission spectra with FWHM 40 nm (Figure 1a). Besides, simply extending 
the rigid helical conjugated skeleton by incorporating additional fused aromatic rings to 
enhance the g values seems does not always work.13 A more profound investigation into the 
relationship between molecular geometry and electronic structure is therefore necessary for the
