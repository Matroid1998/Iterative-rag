Description:
A critical resource with concerns about resource depletion and supply risk.

Text:
In recent years the sustainability crisis of especially lithium has become increasingly recog
nized by the public. The opposition to the continued use of lithium in future energy storage
is most often justified by the expected resource depletion and concomitant future supply
risk.1 Additional factors that should be considered include the inhomogeneous distribution
of deposits, supply chain risks, the environmental impact of the necessary mining operations,
and ethical concerns.14 To develop alternative energy storage solutions that are not based
on critical resources,5,6 numerous research institutions and companies have dedicated a sig
nificant portion of their research and funding to commercially viable sodiumion batteries
(SIBs).
