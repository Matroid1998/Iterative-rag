Understanding the relationship between mechanical 
treatments and PLLAs piezoelectric behavior is crucial for 
the development of advanced biomedical devices with 
improved performance and longevity. By elucidating the 
structural changes underlying PLLAs piezoelectric response, 
this study contributes to the optimization of PLLAbased 
materials for applications ranging from tissue engineering to 
biomedical sensors. II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
PolyLLactic Acid (PLLA) granules, PURASORB PL 24 
from Corbion, were dried overnight at 80C before use. Chloroform served as the solvent for PLLA dissolution. For 
PLLA film preparation, 10 grams of PLLA granules were 
dissolved in 50 grams of chloroform and stirred for 8 hours 
at room temperature. The solution was refrigerated 
overnight. While cold, the solution was poured into a Petri 
dish, the solution was airdried overnight.
