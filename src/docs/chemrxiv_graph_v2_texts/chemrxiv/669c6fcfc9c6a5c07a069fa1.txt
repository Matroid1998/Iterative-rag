Description:
The terminal ring whose orthogonal out-of-plane distortion leads to excited state deactivation via a conical intersection mediated internal conversion.

Interestingly, the N5
alkylated analogs display weak fluorescence in solution, yet 
their fluorescence is greatly enhanced when bound to the enzy
matic binding pocket.31 Additionally, the fluorescence quantum 
yield was found to be markedly enhanced in a frozen state of 
solvents than at room temperature.3233 A joint computational 
and experimental study indicated that an orthogonal outof
plane distortion of the terminal pyrimidine ring leads to the ex
cited state deactivation via a conical intersection (CI) mediated 
internal conversion.33 The geometry confinement imposed by 
the frozen solvent or the protein cavity restraints the ring distor
tion and blocks the CImediated internal conversion, readily ex
plaining the fluorescence enhancement.3334
