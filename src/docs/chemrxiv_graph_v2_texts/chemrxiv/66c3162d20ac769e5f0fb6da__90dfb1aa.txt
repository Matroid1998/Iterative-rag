Description:
LiFePO4 undergoes phase separation during lithiation, exhibiting coexisting Li-poor and Li-rich phases.

For the active 
materials that (de)lithiate following a solidsolution path, such as LiCoO2 (LCO) and LiNixCoyMn1x
yO2 (NMC), Li diffuses inside the particles uniformly such that, when the current is stopped, the 
concentration inside the particles quickly equilibrates. Thus, the system evolves without substantial 
intra or interparticle heterogeneities, relying solely on the particles size distribution and position with 
respect to the electrodes depth as a source of heterogeneities. In contrast, LiFePO4 (LFP) and Li4Ti5O12 
(LTO) undergo phase separation during the (de)lithiation process due to their physiomechanical 
properties. At a given state of charge, even under equilibrium conditions, these particles exhibit 
coexisting Lipoor and Lirich phases. This fundamental difference in reaction behavior, evident in a 
flat voltage plateau and a voltage hysteresis 8, is intricately linked to interparticle heterogeneities.
