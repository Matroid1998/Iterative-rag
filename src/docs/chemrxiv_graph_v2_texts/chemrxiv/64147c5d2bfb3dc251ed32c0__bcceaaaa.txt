Description:
Produced from CO2 and used to relieve peak loads from renewable energy sources.

Text:
A key 
36 
product from CCU is the production of biomethane (CH4) from CO2, which is promoting the abatement of 
37 
greenhouse gas emissions 4. Biomethane utilizes the existing gas infrastructure and can be utilized to relieve 
38 
the peak loads from nondispatchable renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and PV by balancing 
39 
the energy system to reinforce the security of supply. Moreover, the production of biomethane from CO2 is 
40 
necessary for the decarbonization of the hardtoabate sector, where electrification is challenged in 
41 
applications such as longdistance heavyduty transport and industrial processes that are reliant on carbon
42 
based fuels 5. 43 
The use of biomethanation has until now primarily been applied to conversion of CO2 from biogas plants.
