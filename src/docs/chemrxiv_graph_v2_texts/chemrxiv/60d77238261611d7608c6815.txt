Description:
A ubiquitous household ingredient in vinegar known to promote health complications, including increased inflammation and skin irritation in high concentrations.

Here, we modified an acidbase titration 
experiment to demonstrate how universitylevel labs can be 
conducted safely athome. Further, acetic acid is a ubiquitous 
household ingredient in vinegar known to promote health 
complications, including increased inflammation and skin 
irritation in high concentrations.6,7 Thus, we are interested in 
verifying the acetic acid concentration in Whole Foods brand 
white wine vinegar to both address this health issue and to 
propose an athome methodology that can be used to address 
the educational gap created by online laboratory courses.

A component whose concentration can be tested in vinegar through titration experiments.

Previous titration experimentations for acetic acid 
content have largely been dependent on universitylevel 
apparatus, but few experiments have been adapted to test the 
acetic acid concentration in vinegar at home.1,8,9 During our 
Chem 2123W course, we first used ChemCollective webiste 
(httpchemcollective.org) to learn the theoretical knowledge, 
practice titrations and applied what we learned to design our 
own experiment.9 While the ChemCollective titration was 
useful for athome learning, it still lacks the benefits of 
performing and monitoring an experiment inperson as would 
be done in a real laboratory.

Yet, our method is more 
accessible to pandemicera students who only have access to 
common household goods and may not have access to the 
imaging subscriptions, such as Adobe Photoshop, used by 
Andrews et al.1 Our methodology has grounds to be 
incorporated into the online curriculum of university and high 
school chemistry laboratory courses because it provides a 
practical, athome approach to acidbase titrations while still 
being rigorous enough to educate students on titration 
chemistry and educating them on an experiment that is 
significant to human health. Our procedure also provides a 
reliable method through which the acetic acid content of 
vinegar products can be verified.
