Description:
A vaunted structural feature.

Text:
Azetidines and blactams are key part of bioactive molecules, worthy threedimensional bricks 
for medicinal chemistry, and reagents for elaborate syntheses (Scheme 1a).1 Few catalytic methods 
giving densely functionalized monocyclic products were reported. None could be readily switched 
to provide either azetidines or blactams, and the incorporation of an allylamino fragment, which 
is a vaunted structural feature,2 is similarly underdeveloped. The nucleophilic substitution has been widely used to create strained rings,1,3 but the synthesis 
of functionalized precursors is an open issue.
