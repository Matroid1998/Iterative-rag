However, the role of the primitive unit cell volume is more clearly defined, as it dictates the 
number of phonon states within the first Brillouin zone, thus, providing short mean path lengths 
for the heat carrying phonons.415 
Due to their peculiar structural chemistry that can result from the combination of ionic and 
covalent bonding, Zintl phases have emerged as promising candidates for superior TE 
properties.1215 Particularly, the ternary pnictide Zintl phases as they usually exhibit intrinsic 
semiconducting properties with narrow energy band gap, and they feature complex polyanions 
and large channels or cages as their most common structural motives.1227 The rigid anionic 
networks of covalent bounded atoms are suitable for the electron crystal part whereas the 
cationic substructure that consists of encapsulated rattling atoms is adequate for phononglass 
behavior, thereby complying with Slacks model of phononglass electron crystal (PGEC) 
materials.1428 
Consequently, high TE efficiencies were identified in ternary pnictides Zintl phases with 
heaviest alkalineearth metals (A Ca, Sr, Ba), or Eu and Yb.1528 This large family of materials 
are characterized by enhanced complexity of their crystal structures and semiconducting 
behaviors.
