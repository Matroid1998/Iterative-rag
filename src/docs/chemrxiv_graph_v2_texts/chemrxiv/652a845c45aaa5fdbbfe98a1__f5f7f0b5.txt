Description:
Binds to amyloid fibrils by interaction of its NMe2 group perpendicularly aligned to the peptide assembly surface.

1921 On the othre hand, it has been demonstrated
that the regioisomers of anthracene 22 exhibit the AIE be
haviour in two among five investigated derivatives, whereas
the triphenylaminedecorated benzoidithiophenephenazi
nes can be transformed from the ACQ to AIE form via
modification of their crystal packing caused by relocation of
electrondonating substituents  increase of FQY by more
than 15. 23
Scheme 1. Structure of investigated compounds
The applications of AIEdyes in bioimaging exploits their
sensitivity to viscosity and the concentration of specific pro
teins. 24 The classical example, Thioflavin T (ThT), binds
to amyloid fibrils by interaction of its NMe2 group per
pendicularly aligned 25,26 to the peptide assembly surface.
