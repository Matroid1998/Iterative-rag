Description:
Found in singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a high surface-to-volume ratio, sensitive to single-molecule detection.

However, such biologically 
relevant processes occur on temporal (ms) and spatial (nm) scales that are difficult to access 
using established methods.3 For example, electrochemical methods such as amperometry or 
voltammetry lack the required spatial resolution determined by the number of electrodes and 
are invasive as the microelectrodes penetrate the tissue.4 On the other hand optical methods 
provide often only indirect information e.g. by labeling cellular components5,6 or suffer from 
photobleaching.7 
In this context, nanomaterials such as singlewall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have emerged 
as promising building blocks to capture these dynamics.3,8 In addition to a high surfaceto
volume ratio that makes them sensitive to singlemolecule detection9312, their surface can be 
chemically tailored13317.
