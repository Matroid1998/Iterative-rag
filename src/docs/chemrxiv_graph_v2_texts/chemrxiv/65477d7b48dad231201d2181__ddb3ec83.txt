Description:
Involved in oxidative addition for transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.

Text:
Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is 
among the most widely used transformations to prepare chiral mol
ecules from prochiral substrates,1 with classic methods for transition 
metalcatalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation based on the oxidative 
addition of H2 (Scheme 1a).2 While these reactions are high per
forming and widely used, they historically require substrates with co
ordinating functional groups for chelating, twopoint metal binding 
to facilitate enantioinduction3 with limited exceptions.4 Further, the 
highest enantioselectivity is observed with electronpoor olefins 
(activated olefins), as interactions between the substrate and the 
metal are best promoted by substituents on the olefin that are typi
cally electronwithdrawing.5 Recently, hydrogenation of electron
neutral, electronrich (unactivated), and minimally functionalized 
olefins has seen growing improvement and success; however, lower 
enantioselectivity is commonly observed, and fewer methods are 
available.6 
In this context, radical hydrofunctionalization enabled by metal
catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (mHAT, Scheme 1b) reactions 
have particular promise as they do not require metal coordination of 
the olefin for reactivity.7 Mechanistically, mHAT involves a metal
hydride intermediate that transfers H to the olefin to generate an 
alkyl radical that may be trapped under mild conditions.

Involved in typical transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenations of olefins.

Text:
mHAT 
chemistry has been used for olefin hydrofunctionalizations8 with in
expensive Fe, Co, and Mn catalysts and exhibits excellent functional 
group tolerance, permitting latestage functionalizations in total syn
thesis.9 
In 2014, the Shenvi and Herzon groups independently published 
olefin hydrogenation by manganese and cobaltcatalyzed mHAT 
respectively, trapping the transient alkyl radical with a second HAT 
step.8b, e, f mHAT has some advantages over typical transition metal
catalyzed hydrogenations of olefins, which proceed by additions of 
H2.
