Description:
A reactant in solardriven conversion processes for producing clean fuels and chemicals.

Mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 accumulation is essential to tackle the current climate change 
and loss of biodiversity.1 Large scale global efforts are ongoing to develop CO2 conversion 
technologies for green fuel production.2 Solardriven CO2 conversion is a promising approach to 
produce clean fuels and chemicals as it directly utilizes sunlight as the sole energy input.35 
However, current CO2 utilization processes depend on pure and pressurized CO2 as reactant, 
whose production from postcombustion emission streams and air is energy intensive (2 GJ 
tonCO21 or 100 kJ molCO21).6,7 Majority of this energy demand (80) is from desorption and 
compression steps following CO2 capture, involving heating large volumes of alkanolamine 
solutions and subsequent pressurization of the released gas (Figure 1a).8,9 Direct solardriven 
utilization of captured CO2 species is therefore a more attractive way to reach netzero carbon 
cycle, but barely explored due to their thermodynamic stability.10,11,12,13 Thermocatalytic 
hydrogenation of captured CO2 has recently been reported at elevated temperatures (100150 
C).1416 Electrochemical reduction of alkanolamine captured CO2 can also be achieved over 
metallic electrodes (Ag, Cu, etc.)

Description:
A gas that can be captured and converted photocatalytically in solutions.

Text:
at ambient temperatures.1720 Recent studies have shown small
scale localized in situ CO2 gas adsorption followed by photocatalytic conversion in homogeneous 
and colloidal solutions.2123 Nevertheless, sunlightdriven direct capture and utilization processes 
with industrially relevant aminehydroxide capturing agents is lacking, presumably due to the 
overwhelming energy barrier to activate the trapped CO2adducts (Figure S1).24 
Here we report an integrated CO2 capture and solardriven photoelectrochemical (PEC) 
utilization process to produce syngas (mixture of CO and H2), a precursor for industrial liquid 
fuels and chemicals syntheses,25 from concentrated CO2 stream, simulated postcombustion flue 
gas, and atmospheric air. The process operates by combining CO2tofuel reduction with 
selective oxidation of waste plasticderived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA), which 
has applications in pharmaceutical, food and textile industries (Figure 1b).

Description:
Captured and reduced in an aqueous amine or glycolic hydroxide solution.

Text:
The system captures 
CO2 in an aqueous amine or glycolic hydroxide solution and the subsequent PEC conversion 
occurs in a twocompartment, twoelectrode reactor equipped with a triple cation perovskite
based photocathode. Captured CO2 reduction is enabled by an immobilized molecular Co
phthalocyanine catalyst at the photocathode. A bimetallic Cu26Pd74 alloy anode completes the 
circuit by catalyzing EG oxidation. Replacing anodic water oxidation (G0(H2OO2)  237 kJ 
mol1) by EG oxidation (G0(EGGA)  20 kJ mol1)26 makes the demanding captured CO2 
reduction feasible with only sunlight, enabling the system to function even with a single visible
light absorber without any external applied voltage, with simultaneous waste valorization.
