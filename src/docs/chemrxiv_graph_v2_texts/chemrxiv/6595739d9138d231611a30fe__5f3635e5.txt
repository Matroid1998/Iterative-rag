The past investigations of PFAS defluorination were heavily invested in the treatment of model 
47 
PFAS, with only a few studies that used electrochemical oxidation, plasma, advanced oxidation, 
48 
and UVsulfite photoreduction to treat diluted AFFF with total fluorine (TF) ranging between 0.1
49 
27 mg FL.1317 All these technologies demonstrated structurally dependent reactivity in removing 
50 
target PFAS, and none achieved nearcomplete defluorination. To date, only hydrothermal alkaline 
51 
treatment realized 100 defluorination of AFFF but demands high temperature (170350C), 
52 
pressurized reactors (222 MPa), and alkaline addition (5 M of NaOH).18 
53 
Ball milling (BM) is an emerging technology for destroying PFAS chemicals at ambient 
54 
conditions.
