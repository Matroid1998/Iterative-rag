A chain present on the phenyl carbon ortho and meta to the phenylpyridine bond.

of new properties into the complexes through modified CNC ligands. In 
order to develop such a route, we have prepared the related ligand 1 (Fig. 3a), in which there is an 
alkoxy chain on the phenyl carbon ortho and meta to the phenylpyridine bond. The compound 
is prepared by reaction of 2,6dibromopyridine with 2,3dimethoxyphenylboronic acid using a 
SuzukiMiyaura protocol (89 yield), with the 2,2,3,3tetrabutyloxysubstituted ligand resulting 
from demethylation using pyridinium chloride (90 yield) followed by realkylation under 
Williamson ether conditions using 1bromobutane (53 yield). The steric demands of these 
materials mean that in the free ligand, the phenyl and pyridyl rings cannot be coplanar (Fig.
