Description:
Compounds that can exhibit prototropic tautomerism involving tetracoordinate pentavalent phosphorus.

Text:
Phosphinylidenes are a family of organophosphorus compounds that are of biological 
and pharmaceutical importance.13 They are also most commonly employed as ancillary 
ligands in homogenous catalysis.4,5 These include phosphinates, Hphosphonates, H
phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides. Such compounds can exhibit a 
prototropic (i.e., proton migration from one atom to another) tautomerism process 
involving structures with a tetracoordinate pentavalent phosphorus P(V) and a trivalent 
phosphorus P(III) atom (see Scheme 1A). Due to the availability of a free lone pair of 
electrons, the P(III) hydroxide form is known to coordinate with the metal in transition 
metal complexes. However, the P(V) oxide form is known to be the most stable species 
and the tautomeric equilibrium displayed in Scheme 1A is strongly shifted toward P(V) if 
the R were electrondonating groups.

Description:
Compounds where a two-water bridged proton transfer is energetically favorable in the gas phase.

Text:
On the contrary, with electronwithdrawing 
fluororganyl groups, only the P(III) tautomer was isolated and detected spectroscopically, 
and in some cases, a solventdependent equilibrium was observed between the 
tautomeric forms.610 
Although the reactivity of phosphinylidenes suggests the presence of both oxide and 
acid tautomers, the direct intramolecular proton transfer (PT) for their interconversion is 
unfavorable at room temperature due to its high activation barrier of  60 kcal mol1.1115 
Alternatively, an intermolecular PT mechanism between two tautomers of the same 

3 
species,16 a base or watercatalyzed PT has been proposed.11,14,15,17 Recently, a 
detailed computational study on the tautomerization of simple secondary phosphine 
oxides predicted that the twowater bridged PT provides the most energetically favorable 
path in the gas phase, as compared to intra and intermolecular PT involving one, two, or 
three tautomers.12
