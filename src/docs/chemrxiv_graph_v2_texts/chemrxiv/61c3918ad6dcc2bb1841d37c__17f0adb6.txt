Description:
Amorphous structure used to support catalysts.

Text:
As an example, reactive transition metal 
50 
species, inspired by analogous structures on homogeneous catalysts, can be supported on porous 
51 
structures, such as zeolites and amorphous silica, but these catalysts suffer from poor 
52 
oligomerization activity or low selectivity to LAOs.1419 
53 
Density functional theory (DFT)based studies are becoming increasingly important in 
54 
elucidating the structures and properties of active sites, as well as the reaction mechanisms, of 
55 
heterogeneously catalyzed olefin oligomerization processes.2022 For instance, a recent first
56 
principles study by Brogaard et al. investigated Ni(0), Ni, and Ni2 supported on an SSZ24 
57 
framework in the context of ethylene oligomerization. The work revealed that the most plausible
