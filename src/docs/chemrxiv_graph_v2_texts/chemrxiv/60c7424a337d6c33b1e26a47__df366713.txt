Description:
Circulates at the highest serum concentrations and is unaffected by homeostatic control.

Although inactive, 25OHD circulates at the highest serum concentrations and is 
unaffected by homeostatic control; therefore, it is the most common target of analytical 
assays8. Immunoassay accounts for most testing due to its high throughput and ease 
of automation9; however, it suffers from poor accuracy, especially at low 
concentrations10. Unequal antibody affinity for 25OHD2 and 25OHD3 results in a 
negative bias, and cross reactions with other vitamin D metabolites such as 24,25
dihydroxyvitamin D result in a positive bias10,11. Using liquid chromatographymass 
spectrometry (LCMS), these biases can be avoided, since LCMS can differentiate the 
vitamin D metabolites, but these methods require extensive chromatography times to 
separate interference from the stereoisomer 3epi25hydroxyvitamin D (epi25OHD)12.
