Description:
Anderson-type polyoxometalates that can be heterogenized and used as catalysts for gas-phase oxidation reactions.

Text:
We recently reported that Mo(VI)Rh(III)
based, Andersontype polyoxometalates can be controllably 
heterogenized, protected against sintering, even at 200oC, 
and employed catalytically for a representative, gasphase 
oxidation 
reaction, 
under 
thermally 
demanding 
conditions.17 Our approach was to site the POMs within size
matched pores of a hierarchically porous, metalorganic 
framework (MOF) such that periodic arrays of reactant
accessible, yet immobile, clusters are presented. Related 
work has been described for Keggin POMs, with the 
organized POMs then being deployed as heterogeneous 
catalysts for condensedphase oxidation reactions.18,19 We 
reasoned that similarly useful arrays of agglomeration
immune PTMs could be obtained by starting with pre
isolated POMs. The obtained arrays could then be deployed 
as heterogeneous catalysts for reduction reactions.
