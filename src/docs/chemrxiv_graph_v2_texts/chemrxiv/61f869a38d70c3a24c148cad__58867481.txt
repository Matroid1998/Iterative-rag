Description:
Contains cerium atoms whose valence electron orbitals are protected by the electron octet of crystalline oxygen.

Text:
According to that explanation, valence electron orbitals of the cerium atoms in 
CeO2 are protected by the electron octet 2s22p6 of crystalline oxygen which makes it difficult for water molecules to 
build chemical bonds with the surface. Later studies found, however, that asprepared REOs show intrinsic 
hydrophilicity, and attributed high water contact angles (WCA) to adsorption of hydrocarbons which often are present 
in indoor air and pump systems 610. Surface cleaning with high temperature annealing or with plasma treatment 
11 are able to switch the wetting behavior of REOs from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity. The hydrocarbon 
adsorption usually occurs at surface defects such as oxygen vacancies and adsorbed OH groups, or by physical 
adsorption on the locally ideal surface 11.
