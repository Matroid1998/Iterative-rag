Description:
A nonradical cationic center in radical cation induced addition reactions.

Text:
A new class of organic reactions named as Radical Cation Induced Addition (RCIA) (type and ) 
via a oneelectron oxidation activation mode (Figure 1), was proposed by us1 recently due to its 
multidisciplinary use. A key feature in their difference with the common radical coupling reactions is a 
priority reactivity at a nonradical carbon cationic centre added by a poor nucleophile like water, 
resulted by a highly delocalized radical spin centre. To generate a relatively stable radical cation 
intermediate enabling delocalization of the radical spin, only olefin substrates with at least one
