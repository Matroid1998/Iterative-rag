Description:
H-bonding functionalities explored for their influence on optoelectronic properties in assemblies.

This usually leads to a lack of 
consensus regarding their incorporation into electronic devices.9,10 Still, the proper control of the H
bonded semiconducting structures opens a strategy for the design of alternative organic electronic 
materials whose properties can be modified through aggregation. Our group and others have studied H
bonded conjugated molecules containing different Hbonding functionalities, such as 
semicarbazones,11 ureas,1214 amides1519 or selfcomplementary Hbonds2022 to explore the impact of 
Hbonding in the optoelectronic properties of the assemblies.
