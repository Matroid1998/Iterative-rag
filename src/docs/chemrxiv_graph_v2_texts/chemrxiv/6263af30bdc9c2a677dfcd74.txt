Description:
Dyes involved in the supramolecular organization on protein scaffolds for light absorption.

Text:
Precise assembly of molecular chromophores assisted by proteins as 
scaffolds plays an important role in natural lightharvesting 
complexes in photosynthetic organisms such as plants and bacteria.1 
Specifically, 
the 
intricate 
supramolecular 
organization 
of 
chromophores (e.g. chlorophyll dyes) on protein scaffolds leads to 
shift of light absorption to longer wavelengths, a characteristic 
phenomenon of Jaggregation, and promotes the efficient energy 
transfer at different size and time scales. Such Jaggregation has also 
been observed in a series of synthetic molecular chromophores, such 
as amphiphilic cyanine dyes in aqueous solution,26 as well as 
derivatives of perylene bisimides,7 porphyrins,8, 9 chlorophylls,10 
phthalocyanines,11, 
12 
BODYPI,13, 
14 
squaraines,13, 
15 
and 
hydroazaacene dicarboximide 16.
