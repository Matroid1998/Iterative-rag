Description:
Involved in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyzers.

Text:
AEL, on the other hand, uses nonnoblemetal catalysts, making it cheaper,
but typically results in lower efficiency. Therefore, significant improvements in efficiency while maintaining
stable operation are necessary for AEL 5, 6, 7, 8. Alkaline electrolyzers comprise two halfcell reactions, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and the
Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), with the cell efficiency being drastically undermined by the slug
gish kinetics of the OER. Therefore, research focuses on exploring more active catalyst materials for the
OER. Despite the importance of high catalytic activity to minimize overpotential losses, the catalysts
durability should not be forgotten. Catalysts are seldom tested under industrial electrolyzer conditions,
creating a discrepancy between laboratory test conditions and industrial electrolyzer conditions displayed
in Figure 1.
