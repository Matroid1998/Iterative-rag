Description:
Paired with diverse olefins in a branch-selective protocol for constructing complex aliphatic frameworks.

of new C(sp3)coupling partners within this paradigm can 
provide entry to novel, medicinallyrelevant chemical space. Alkenes are abundant, benchstable and undergo facile 
C(sp3)radical reactivity via metalhydride hydrogen atom 
transfer (MHAT), yet metallaphotoredox methodologies in
voking this strategy remain underdeveloped. Importantly, 
the merger of MHAT activation with metallaphotoredox ca
talysis could enable crosscoupling of olefins with feedstock 
radical partners only activated via photocatalysis, such as 
alcohols. Herein, we report the first C(sp3)C(sp3) coupling 
of MHATactivated alkenes with alcohols (i.e. deoxygena
tive hydroalkylation) via triple cocatalysis. Through syner
gistic Ir photocatalysis, Mn MHAT and Ni radical sorting 
pathways, this branchselective protocol pairs diverse ole
fins with methanol or primary alcohols, displays remarka
ble functional group tolerance, and enables the rapid con
struction of complex aliphatic frameworks.
