Numerous U.S. domestic and international initiatives 1,2 have increased focus on GHG emis
32
sions reductions. In the U.S., the National Climate Task Force has set groundbreaking
33
goals to reduce domestic GHG emissions 5052 below 2005 levels by 2030. 3 These eorts
34
have focused attention on reducing methane emissions; methane is the second most common
35
greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2), and has a global warming potential (GWP) 86 4
36
times that of CO2 on a 20 year basis. 37
The oil and gas (OG) supply chain represents a substantial source of methane emis
38
sions, notably from the production, transport, and use of natural gas.
