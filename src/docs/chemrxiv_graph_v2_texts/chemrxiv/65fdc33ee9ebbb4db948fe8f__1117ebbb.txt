Description:
Poses a major challenge for electrode materials discovery in potassium-ion batteries due to its large size.

These properties have made MoS2 highly desirable in many 
research domains including heterojunction solar cells,3,4 electrophotocatalysis,5,6 strain 
sensors7 and thermoelectric devices.8 Particularly, the layered structure composed of SMo
S slabs provides highly accessible sites, resulting in MoS2 being a promising electrode material 
for battery applications.912 In the area of potassiumion batteries (PIBs) where the large size 
of Kion poses a major challenge for electrode materials discovery, the wide interlayer spacing 
(0.62 nm) and weak Van der Waals interaction between the SMoS slabs can effectively 
accommodate Kions and lower the energy barrier of Kion diffusion. The capability to transfer 
up to four electrons per MoS2 formula indicates a high theoretical capacity (670 mAh g1).
