Description:
A metal used in experiments involving evaporation on BMPTFSI films.

Text:
We rst present and discuss the results of systematic XPS
measurements on the interaction of a multilayer lm of molec
ularly adsorbed BMPTFSI lm a HOPG substrate with in
creasing amounts of metallic Li evaporated on top of it (sec
tion II A). Next we apply DFT calculations to explore the
thermodynamic stability of possible decomposition products
and kinetic barriers for their formation (section II B and sec
tion II C). Subsequently, we compute core level binding en
ergies of probable reaction products and compare these with
the experimental ndings in the XPS experiments to unam
biguously identify the products and longliving intermediates
