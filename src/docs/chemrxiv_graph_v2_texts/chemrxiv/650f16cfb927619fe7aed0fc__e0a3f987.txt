Antimicrobial agents that Salmonella has developed resistance to.

Text:
Antibiotic resistance has become one of the leading threats to human health worldwide in
the face of widespread antibiotic abuse and lack of new pharmaceutical treatments1, with the
Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report finding that over
50 of bacteria in bloodstream infections are resistant to antibiotics2. Salmonella, a foodborne
pathogen associated with 1.2 million illnesses annually3, is particularly dangerous because it has
developed resistance to several common antibiotics, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
