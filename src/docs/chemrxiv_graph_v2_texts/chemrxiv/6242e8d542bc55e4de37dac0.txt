Description:
A hydrophobic compound that can be used to form hydrophobic coatings.

Text:
In this approach,
an organiciron precursor is heated in situ with an amphiphilic
surfactant or ligand such as oleic acid, a hydrophobic fatty acid,
forming hydrophobic coated SPIONs which typically avoid aggre
gation.23,2729
To obtain biocompatible SPIONs that are colloidally and physi
cally stable, it is necessary to coat and functionalise the nanopar
ticle surface. Without this coating, the poor colloidal stability of
SPIONs often leads to agglomeration under physiological condi
tions, leading to increased toxicity via red blood cell damage and
haemolysis.14,30,31 Furthermore, uncoated SPIONs are suscepti
ble to oxidation, which can contribute to changes in magnetic
properties and chemical behaviour.2,8,32 There are various coat
ing strategies to achieve this, including both covalent and non
covalent synthetic methods such as surface stabilisation with cit
