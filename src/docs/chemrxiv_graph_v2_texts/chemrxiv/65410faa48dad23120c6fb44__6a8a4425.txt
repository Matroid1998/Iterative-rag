Description:
A substrate on which edge-induced Kondo resonance in nonplanar zigzag edge termini has been demonstrated.

One of the
effective methods for widening the band gap of graphene is the creation of 1D graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) from 2D
graphene sheets.1719 GNRs with different shapes and widths can be experimentally synthesized using lithography and
bottomup chemical synthesis using molecular precursors.2024 The Band gap engineering and magnetic properties
of GNRs have been extensively studied.2529 The zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are lowbandgap magnetic
semiconductors with antiferromagnetic coupling between the opposite edges. Recently, Xu et al. have experimentally
demonstrated the edgeinduced Kondo resonance in nonplanar zigzag edge termini on bare Au(111).30 The antifer
romagnetic coupling and spindegenerate energy levels result in the poor magnetic moment of ZGNR, which limits
its application in spintronics. Son et al.
