Description:
Chemically stable systems represented by ferrocene and its derivatives.

Text:
Ferrocene and its numerous derivatives have brought a breakthrough in 
metallocene chemistry. They represent chemically and thermally stable systems that 
undergoes reversible electrochemical oxidation and reduction processes 1. This makes 
the chemistry of ferrocenes different from many other classical aromatic systems. Ferrocene and its derivatives possess a range of useful properties 2, which led to their 
wide applications in catalysis as ligands for asymmetric synthesis 3, materials science 
(molecular electronicsensory devices, switchable functional systems, nonlinear optics) 
1, medicine (antimalaria, anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial agents) 4, 5, and even 
components of rocket fuels 6. Among the most representative bioactive ferrocenes can 
be mentioned antimalarial Ferroquine 1 7, antimicrobial 2, 3 8, 9 and anticancer 
compounds 46 1012 (Fig. 1).
