The standard equilibrium
potential of the overall water splitting reaction is 1.23 V. However, the prac
tical operating cell voltage for hydrogen evolution lies between 1.52.0 V. The

additional voltage, also referred to as overvoltage or overpotential, must be ap
plied to overcome the energy barriers of the OER. The overall system eciency
thus remains between 5970  for commercially available electrolysers 5, 6. Improvement of this eciency and increasing the hydrogen production rate are
pivotal practical goals to achieve for this technology. 25
Nibased oxides are earthabundant materials and recognized as promising elec
