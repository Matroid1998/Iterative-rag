Description:
A commercially used anode material with a theoretical capacity of 372 mAhg.

Text:
Conventionally, lithium transition metal oxides (LiCoO2, LiMnO2, 
LiNixCoyMn1xyO2, etc.) have been used as cathode materials. A major limiting factor of this 
group of materials to be used as cathode material is their inherent low theoretical capacity, 
recyclability and higher cost due to the presence of metal. Commercially used anode material, 
graphite, has a theoretical capacity of 372 mAhg which is relatively high compared to 
conventionally used cathode materials.3 Therefore, a material that is specifically designed to 
achieve high theoretical capacity while maintaining excellent energy density and longterm 
cyclic stability is highly sought after.
