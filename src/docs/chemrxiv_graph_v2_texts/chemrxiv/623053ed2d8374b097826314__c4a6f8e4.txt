Description:
A pioneering system studied for its SMM behavior under applied pressure.

ously, the listedabove stimuli induced chemical modifications 
of the target system such as ligand orand metalcentered oxi
dation state, isomerization, protonation, modification of the co
ordination number... leading, from a chemical point of view, to 
different starting and final systems. Thus, an applied pressure 
as external stimulus appears as a promising alternative to finely 
tune the SMM behavior. The few examples of such studies have 
been carried out mainly on the pioneering Mn12 system,3537 as 
well as on other manganesebased SMMs.3841 To the best of our 
knowledge, only two examples of lanthanide complexes studied 
under applied pressure have been reported to date.
