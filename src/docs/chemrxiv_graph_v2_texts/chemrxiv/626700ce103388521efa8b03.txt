of innovative QD heterostructures, which were mostly aimed at 
reducing the Auger recombination rate of multiexcitons and thus prolong the lifetime of the 
inverted state.1618 Here, in particular CdSeCdS coreshell QDs proved highly suited, for which an 
optimal balance between material gain and invertedstate lifetime can be found by adapting the 
core and shell sizes. 8,9 
Following the restrictions on the use of cadmium in electronic appliances, InPbased QDs are 
emerging as the most viable substitutes for CdSebased QDs as printable, spectrally narrow and
