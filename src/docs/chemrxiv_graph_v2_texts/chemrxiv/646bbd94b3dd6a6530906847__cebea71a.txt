Description:
Residues that can form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms in the lactone ring.

Text:
The aromatic ring allows a series of hydrophobic, , CH, and cation 
interactions, and the two oxygen atoms in the lactone ring can also hydrogenbond with amino acid 
residues in different classes of enzymes and receptors (Torres et al., 2016). The relevant 
pharmacological profile of the Hchromen2one nucleus is illustrated with its presence in the main 
backbone of approved drugs such as warfarin (anticoagulant), carbochromen (vasodilator), and 
novobin (antibiotic) (Singh et al., 2019). Regarding the molecular hybridization strategy, 
coumarins have also been employed along with diverse bioactive compounds (Sandhu et al., 2014; 
Kerru et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2019; Zhang  Xu, 2019). Pyrimidine and derivatives are also a significant and widespread class of nitrogen
containing heterocycles that are an integral part of DNA and RNA building blocks.
