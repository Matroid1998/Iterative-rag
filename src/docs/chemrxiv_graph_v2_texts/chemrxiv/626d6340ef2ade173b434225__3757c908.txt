Description:
An electrocatalyst with sulfur vacancies that can serve as active sites for CO2RR.

Such outcome demands computational studies, usually 
performed using quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations, employing density 
functional theory (DFT).1921 These studies have, in turn, revealed that sulfur vacancies are 
associated with electronic states within the bandgap of MoS2 that are centered at Mo,16 which 
could be leveraged as active site for CO2RR.21 While these calculations reveal important insights 
into the scaling relationships of different molecular intermediates of CO2RR at defect sites,1921 
the electronic features that define the interaction between them and the MoS2 electrocatalyst in 
the active state remain unclear. Broadly speaking, unambiguous experimental verification of the 
proposed computational mechanisms of CO2RR by MoS2 has not been articulated, largely owing 
to the mismatch in length and timescale between theory and experiments.
