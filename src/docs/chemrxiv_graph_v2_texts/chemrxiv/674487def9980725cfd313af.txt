Description:
A long-chain fatty acyl group cleaved by Sirt2.

These isotypes share a highly conserved catalytic domain but differ in cellular 
localization and substrate specificity.1 
Sirtuin 2 (Sirt2) is primarily cytoplasmic but can shuttle into the nucleus.2 It has a broad substrate 
scope, deacetylating histones (e.g., H4K16 and H3K18)3,4 and nonhistone proteins such as tubulin,5
 FOXO3,6 GAPDH,7 and p300.8 Sirt2 also cleaves off longchain fatty acyl groups (e.g., myristoyl 
groups),9,10 with identified substrates including KRas4a,11 RalB,12 and ARF6.13 Given its wide range of 
substrates, Sirt2 regulates key cellular pathways, such as mitosis, metabolism, aging, inflammation, 
and gene transcription.7,1417 Dysregulation of Sirt2 is implicated in numerous diseases, including 
neurological and metabolic disorders, as well as cancer, which makes Sirt2 a potential drug target.15,18
20 Consequently, understanding the unique structural properties of Sirt2 is crucial for designing potent 
and selective inhibitors.
