Description:
Used in an elution solvent for strong acids in SAX SPE and mass spectrometry analysis.

Text:
of an elution 
solvent containing ammonium bicarbonate extended the current applicability of SAX
SPE for strong acids and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. This new method 
performed with consistently higher recovery (88  7  at 500 ng L1), improved 
selectivity and lower matrix interference (mean  12) over a generic mixedmode 
weak anion exchange SPE method. In addition, a novel filter for reducing fullscan 
features from fulvic and humic acids was successfully introduced, reducing workload 
and potential for false positives. The workflow was then applied to NTASS of 10 
London municipal drinking water samples, allowing the identification of 22 confirmed 
substances. Several poorly investigated and potentially harmful compounds were 
found.
