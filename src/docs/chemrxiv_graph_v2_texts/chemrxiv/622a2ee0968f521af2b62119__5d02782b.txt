Description:
Byproducts of pectin extraction, broadening the applicability of pectin.

Chiefly derived from citrus peel and apple pomace, pectin is the 
most valued food hydrocolloid.1 New developments in pectin 
science and chemical technology (new green chemistry extraction 
and new green engineering isolation technologies) have opened 
the route to new and unexpected applications of this uniquely 
complex heteropolysaccharide, including the usage of pectin 
extraction byproducts, particularly pectin oligosaccharides and 
polyphenols, thereby broadening the applicability of pectin.2 
Among the aforementioned new green extraction technologies, 
hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) of citrus fruit biowaste obtained 
after citrus juice industrial extraction, has lately emerged as one of 
the most promising natural product green extraction techniques.3 
Carried out in water only directly on semiindustrial scale (42 kg 
of waste orange peel in 120 L water), the process affords a low 
methoxyl (LM) pectin with 17.05 degree of esterification (DE, 
percent of methylesterified carboxyl groups) uniquely rich in 
adsorbed hesperidin, naringin (and hydroxycinnamic acid 
derivatives) alongside limonene, myrcene and pinene.4 
The process has been subsequently extended to other citrus 
processing biowastes, including those of lemon5 and grapefruit.6 
Invariably, the citrus pectin thereby obtained contained large 
amounts of citrus flavonoids and terpenes, with a uniquely low DE 
of these pectins readily isolated after the HCbased extraction via 
freezedrying.
