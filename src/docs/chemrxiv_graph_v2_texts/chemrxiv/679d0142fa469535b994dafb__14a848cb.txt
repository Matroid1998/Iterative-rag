Description:
A compound involved in lithium plating detected by ultrasonic testing.

Text:
Amplitude and timeofflight measurements correlate to the stateofcharge (SOC)
and stateofhealth (SOH) of cells during charge and discharge.1517 Variations in amplitude
within pouch cells have been shown to correlate to wetting behavior.18 Lithium plating was
detected from operando ultrasonic testing in lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide  copper
