Description:
A 1,2-diketone that exhibits room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with narrowband emission.

Considering 
the luminescence of the same quantum efficiency, highcolorpurity 
emission has a sharp and intense spectral peak that is visible, distin
guishable, and vivid. These are essential feature for OLED displays 
and bioimaging.13 However, organic RTP is usually broad with 80
120nm fullwidths at halfmaxima (FWHM)(Figure 1b, Table S1). Moreover, because of an inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) from 
singlet to triplet states, organic phosphors often exhibit both RTP 
and fluorescence, further impairing color purity. As a longknown 
exception, 1,2diketones, such as biacetyl and benzil, exhibit RTP 
with small FWHM values (i.e., narrowband RTP).14 However, the 
RTP is feeble in solution. Thus, simultaneously achieving a high p 
and color purity in organic RTP remains a tremendous challenge.
