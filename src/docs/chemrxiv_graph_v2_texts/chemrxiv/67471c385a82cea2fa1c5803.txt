Description:
An element used to confine frontier orbitals by its complementary electronegativity.

Text:
These mate
rials leverage resonance effects to confine frontier orbitals to specific atoms by incorporating elements
with complementary electronegativity, such as boron and nitrogen, at the ortho or parapositions of
rigid conjugated rings. This approach not only effectively separates the HOMO and LUMO orbitals,
endowing the molecule with excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties, but also
