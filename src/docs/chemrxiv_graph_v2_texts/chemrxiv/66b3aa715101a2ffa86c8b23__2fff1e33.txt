Description:
Used as an anode in commercial Li-ion batteries with a limited theoretical capacity of 372 mAh g-1 and a related thermal runaway issue.

Text:
Improving the performance of commercial energy storage devices in terms of energy 
density, power density, cycling stability, safety and cost in a sustainable manner is 
the grand challenge of energy storage technology. No current device complies with 
all these requirements. Current commercial Liion batteries (LIBs) offer limited 
capacity, low power density and have problems of cycling instability, in addition to 
well known safetyrelated issues.1 Supercapacitors are high power density and long 
cycling life devices but have much lower energy density than batteries.2, 3 Current 
commercial LIBs use graphite as anode with a limited theoretical capacity of 372 
mAh g1 and a wellknown related thermal runaway issue.1 
Nanostructured materials have demonstrated a high potential in energy storage 
applications1, 4, 5.

New chemistries and geometries have opened up new horizons in 
energy storage. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been investigated for 
applications as LIB anode, where they offer a higher capacity than graphite.6 TMDs 
have a generalized formula of MX2, where M is a metal from groups 410, i.e., M  Ti, 
V, Nb, Mo, W, and X is a chalcogen XS, Se, Te.7 Semiconducting 2H MoS2 is active 
in a 30.01 V vs LiLi electrochemical window, where energy storage takes place via 
ion intercalation and conversion processes delivering a joint theoretical capacity of 
669 mA h g1 (Equations 24).6 However, experimentally and under suitable 
nanostructuring, the capacity can be higher.
