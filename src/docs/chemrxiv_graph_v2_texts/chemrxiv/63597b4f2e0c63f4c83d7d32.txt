Description:
Building blocks of peptides with applications in biomaterials, biomimetic compounds for catalysis, and drug design.

Understanding the correlation between composition, struc
ture, properties and functional role of biomolecules is at the
very heart of biochemistry and biophysics. The rst step
in this hierarchy, i.e. the connection between composition
and structure has thus attracted enormous interest both
in the case of e.g. entire proteins 36 as well as for smaller
peptides. 710 The latter are especially interesting in view
of reducing the complexity of natural systems and study
ing smallersize models under controlled conditions. Fur
thermore, peptides made of few amino acids have attracted
much attention in recent years thanks to their promising and
wide scope of applications, be it in the fabrication of bio
materials, 11 the engineering of biomimetic compounds for
catalysis 12 or in drug design.
