Description:
A nucleotide triphosphate involved in the polymerization of nucleic acids.

Text:
Genetic information of all life forms and viruses is stored in nucleic acid sequences 
which are linear polymers synthesized in cells by the polymerization of four distinct nucleotide 
triphosphates  adenosine (ATP), guanosine (GTP), cytidine (CTP), thymidine (TTP) and uridine 
(UTP, which replaces TTP in RNA). Each nucleotide consists of a purine or pyrimidine 
nitrogenous base attached to a ribose sugar (deoxyribose for DNA) together forming a nucleoside, 
linked to a triphosphate group. In addition to their role as the building blocks of DNA and RNA,

nucleotides and nucleosides play critical roles in several biological processes including energy 
storage (ATP) (1), signaling pathways (e.g. cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP) (2, 3), innate 
immunity (e.g. cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate, cGAMP) (4, 5), as 
cofactors for specific enzymes (e.g.

sadenosylmethionine, SAM) (6, 7) and as neurotransmitters 
(e.g. adenosine) (8). Chemical analogs of nucleotides and nucleosides therefore have a wide range 
of applications, for example as substrates for artificial synthesis of DNARNA sequences with 
increased resistance to nucleases (9, 10) or reduced effect on innate immune responses (11, 12), 
inhibition of viral DNA and RNA polymerases (13, 14), inhibition of tumor cell replication (15, 
16) and treatment of autoimmune diseases (17). Nucleoside analogs are also critical in 
understanding the early evolution of life on earth under prebiotic conditions (1820) and could 
provide a means of engineering synthetic organisms with expanded genetic alphabets (21). Thus, 
exploration of molecular space of nucleoside analogs could have a huge impact on several areas 
of fundamental and translational biology.
