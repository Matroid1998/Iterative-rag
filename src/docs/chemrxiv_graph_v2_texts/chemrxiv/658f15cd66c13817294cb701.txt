Description:
Random AB-type copolyimides that produce sequence-dependent 1H NMR complexation shifts.

Text:
We have recently shown that highly sequencedependent 1H NMR complexationshifts are produced 
in the spectra of certain random ABtype copolyimides based on 1,4,5,8naphthalene tetracarboxylic 
diimide (NDI) on complexation by an aromatic probe molecule such as pyrene or perylene 1517. This phenomenon arises from cumulative ringcurrent shielding 19, 20 of the central residue in an 
NDIcentred sequence, produced by the probemolecules complexing to NDI residues by 
electronically complementary ppstacking 21, 22. Such shielding results not only from the probe
molecule binding directly at the central observed NDI residue, but also from complexation to NDI 
residues at neighbouring (and nextneighbouring, and nextnextneighbouring etc.) positions viewed 
in both directions from the centre of the sequence.
