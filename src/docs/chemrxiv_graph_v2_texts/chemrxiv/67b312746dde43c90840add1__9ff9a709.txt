Description:
An element that can stabilize partial positive charges in certain chemical contexts, such as in anomeric carbons.

Conversely, Woerpel, Crich and others have 
advocated for the hypothesis that throughspace electrostatic 
stabilization of ion pairs 2 could explain the high stereoselec
tivity observed.13,25,31 Crich and coworkers have provided sig
nificant experimental evidence against dioxolenium ion inter
mediates for 4Oesters,25,32,33 and concluded that the evidence 
supports this alternative electrostatic stabilization hypothesis. They have rationalized selectivities reported elsewhere under 
their theory (e.g., more electronrich 4Opivalates give higher 
selectivity than 4Oacetates because they can better stabilize 
the partial positive charge on the anomeric carbon).
