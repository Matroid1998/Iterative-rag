Description:
Systems with rich and wide absorption ranges promising for increased absorptive cross sections and effective use of the solar spectrum.

Therefore, control of electron 
transfer pathways in donoracceptor systems by 
employing 
novel 
supramolecular 
concepts 
is 
significant not only to enrich our knowledge on the 
mechanistic details of the complex biological electron 
transfer processes 35, but also beneficial for 
fabricating molecular electronic devices 6,7 and 
sensors 8 and also in light energy harvesting systems. Supramolecular approach, both energetically and 
spatially, are the key factors to have control over the 
mechanism and the rate of energy transfer or electron 
transfer processes. The rich and wide absorptions 
range seen in porphyrinoid systems hold particular 
promise for increased absorptive cross sections and, 
thus, an effective use of the solar spectrum 9.

Description:
Systems with high electronic excitation energy influencing strong exergonic electron transfer.

Text:
High 
electronic excitation energy of porphyrinoid systems 
(2.0 eV) influences a strong exergonic electron 
transfer that successively mediates the conversion 
between light and electrical chemical energy 10. Porphyrins play a vital role in photosynthesis due to 
their strong absorption in the visible region, and the 
ease of adjusting their chemical structures. Porphyrins 
are wide class of materials, which are extensively 
studied for their role in electron transfer phenomenon 
in photosynthesis, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), 
etc. In order to develop organic photovoltaic cells and 
artificial photosynthetic systems, photoinduced energy 
transfer and electron transfer processes have been 
widely studied in porphyrin based donoracceptor (D
A) molecular systems 1116. In our present study, we 
have selected octaethylporphyrin (OEP) as donor and 
2nitrofluorene (2NF) as an acceptor in acetonitrile 
polar solvent.
