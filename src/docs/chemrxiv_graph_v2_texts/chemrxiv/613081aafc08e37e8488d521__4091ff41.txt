Description:
The parent crystal from which graphene sheets are isolated.

Text:
Interest in atomically thin 2D materials skyrocketed with the 
isolation of graphene sheets from graphite parent crystals and the 
realisation that these sheets can be exploited in optoelectronic 
devices.1 The extraordinarily high charge carrier mobility in 
graphene of up to 200,000 cm2 V1 s1 is a result of the changed 
electronic structure of the atomic layer when compared to the bulk 
material.2 The high mobility of semimetallic graphene comes at 
the price of an absent off state that has foreclosed its application 
in transistors.3,4 Strategies to open up graphenes bandgap 
revolve around the introduction of heteroatoms and structural 
defects in diffusionlimited or statistical postprocessing as well as 
nanostructuring.57 However, none of these methods are 
scalable and they do not yield products able to compete with 
silicon based devices to date.8 
Crystalline organic 2D materials that contain predictable 
deletions (i.e.
