Description:
Used in the synthesis of 1D nanomaterials such as long nanotubes.

Text:
With band gaps ranging from 1.65
eV to 3.7 eV depending on the crystal phase reported in
the literature (5, 6), In2S3 could be used in a variety of
optoelectronic applications such as buffer layers in photo
voltaics (7), in display devices and photodetectors (812),
or for water splitting (13). Although research on indium
sulde colloidal nanoparticles has been quite active in the
past years, notably in the exploration of different synthetic
pathways, only partial shape control has been achieved to
date. For example, several reports describe the synthesis
of 1D nanomaterials such as long nanotubes (14) using
InCl3 and sulfur in oleylamine, while ditertbutyl disulde
and indium acetylacetonate in oleylamine yield In2S3
nanorods with a mean length of 170 nm (15).
