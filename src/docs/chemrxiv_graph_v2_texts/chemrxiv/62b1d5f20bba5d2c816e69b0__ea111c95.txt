Description:
Undergo radical ring-opening via thiocarbonyl addition ring-opening (TARO) providing backbone thioester functionality.

Text:
Recently, thionolactones were shown to undergo radical ringopening via thiocarbonyl addition
ringopening (TARO)614 which provides backbone thioester functionality. These thioesters can be 
selectively cleaved through aminolysis, thiolysis (including under biologically relevant 
conditions)7 and, very rapidly, through persulfate oxidation.6 RDRP of thionolactones has been 
achieved exclusively through RAFT polymerization with which TARO radical polymerization 
appears to be fully compatible. During the writing of this manuscript, Lages et al reported the 
successful nitroxidemediated copolymerization of nbutyl acrylate and styrene with up to 2 mol
 DOT.15 
Atom transfer radical polymerization16 is, arguably, more complex than RAFT polymerization.17 
But it has a distinct advantage over (thermally initiated) RAFT in that it does not require a radical 
initiator (such as AIBN). Consequently, brushes can be grafted from initiatorfunctional surfaces
