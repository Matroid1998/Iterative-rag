Description:
Molecules with leaving groups on each double bond, termed next generation maleimides (NGMs).

Homogeneous and welldefined bsAbs can only be generated through such 
siteselective functionalization strategies  as any heterogenous conjugation strategy would by definition 
lead to a heterogenous bsAb. The first example of a chemically produced FabFab conjugate was published in 2013, where two bis
sulfone molecules attached to a large PEG linker were used to generate a monospecific FabPEGFab 
construct.8 Subsequently, maleimide molecules with leaving groups on each double bond (termed next
generation maleimides, NGMs) were attached to each other to generate bisNGM molecules. These were
