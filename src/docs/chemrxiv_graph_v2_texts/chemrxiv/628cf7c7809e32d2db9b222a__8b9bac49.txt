Description:
Molecular triplet states are efficiently quenched by O2.

In principle any 
phosphorescent compound can serve as an oxygen sensor, 
since molecular triplet states are efficiently quenched by O2.12 
However, phosphorescent compounds give a turnoff 
response to oxygen, so their use requires accurate 
measurement of absolute luminescence intensity, which is 
prone to issues with calibration and reproducibility, resulting 
from variable excitation power, optical path length, and in 
biological applications heterogeneous cellular environments.13 
Measurement of the phosphorescence lifetime attenuation 
works well in principle for sensing oxygen but is more 
technically complex. Luminescent ratiometric oxygen sensors 
avoid these limitations by incorporating two emission signals 
which are differentially modulated by O2, and hence the ratio of 
the two emission intensities can provide a simple and accurate 
readout of oxygen concentration.
