Description:
Undergo deoxygenative transformation studied by the Li group.

Text:
Meanwhile, recent attention has been focused on the deoxygena
tive transformation of aromatic carbonyls, which has been exten
sively studied by the Li group and others.16 Regarding this field of 
research, we have also developed a deoxygenative CP bond for
mation of aromatic esters (Figure 1C).17 In this reaction, an aro
matic ester reacts with phosphine oxide in the presence of a palla
dium catalyst to give an acylphosphine oxide species as the inter
mediate. The intermediate has a highly electrondeficient carbonyl, 
thus a nucleophilic attack of the phosphine oxide to the carbonyl 
occurs, followed by a 1,2phosphaBrook rearrangement and 
reduction of the carbonoxygen bond using a palladium catalyst 
and sodium formate (HCO2Na) as a mild reductant to afford the 
corresponding deoxygenative products.
