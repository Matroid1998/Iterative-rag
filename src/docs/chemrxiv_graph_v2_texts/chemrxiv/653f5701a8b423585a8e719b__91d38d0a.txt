Description:
Nucleophiles used in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction for carbon-carbon bond formation.

Transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling reactions have 
revolutionized the construction of CC bonds, as demon
strated in several name reactions.1 Among these cross
coupling processes, the SuzukiMiyaura reaction is one 
of the most utilized methods for carboncarbon bond 
formation owing to its extensive reaction scope, broad 
functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, as 
well as the stability and availability of organoboron rea
gents (Scheme 1a).2 Despite the Suzuki reaction being 
commonly used for constructing C(sp2)C(sp2) bonds, 
extending this process to form C(sp3)C(sp2) bonds using 
alkylboron nucleophiles still presents a significant chal
lenge.3 The utilization of C(sp3) coupling partners in 
transition metalcatalyzed reactions is hampered by slow 
metal transmetalation and the susceptibility of alkyl lig
ands to undergo hydride elimination.
