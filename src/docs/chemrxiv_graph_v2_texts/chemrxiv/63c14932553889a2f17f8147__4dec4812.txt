Description:
A key building block synthesized from cyclopentanone in 5 steps.

Text:
Subsequent routes by Chapman11 and Tsanaktsidis12 allowed for 
cyclopentanone to be used as starting material at comparable synthetic efficiency and 
overall yield. Further optimizations of Tsanaktsidiss route by Linclau and coworkers 
allowed for the synthesis of decagram quantities of 1 in overall yields of between 33
40.13 Despite extensive work, current synthetic routes to 1 rely upon the synthesis of 
key building block dibromodione 2 from cyclopentanone in 5 steps (Scheme 1B).
