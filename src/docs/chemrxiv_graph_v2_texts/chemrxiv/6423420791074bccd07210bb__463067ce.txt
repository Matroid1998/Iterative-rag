Description:
Heterocycles with a four-membered ring size.

Homoallylic 
amines 
are 
important 
precursors 
in 
biologically active compounds of both natural and 
synthetic origin.1,2 Access to heterocycles of various ring 
sizes ranging from azetidines (four) and pyrrolidines (five) 
to piperidine and quinoline analogues (six) demonstrates 
the versatile utility of this particular scaffold.37 Homoallylic 
amines are typically prepared via the allylation of imine 
substrates in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. Examples 
of allyl nucleophiles include allylstannanes and allylic or
ganometallics,8 however these reagents can suffer from air 
and moisture sensitivity.9,10 Allylsilanes can be used in a Sa
kuraiHosomi reaction of imines,11 and have become in
creasingly popular for environmental and stability reasons. Their reactivity can be modulated by fluoride sources that 
serve as activators to generate pentavalent silicates.
