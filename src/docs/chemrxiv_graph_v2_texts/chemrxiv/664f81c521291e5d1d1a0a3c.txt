Description:
Increases the work function as layers are deposited on surfaces.

Text:
A weakness of conventional electron multipliers is ageing, 
whereby the detectors gain falls as the total charge output in
creases. To a great extent this is compensated by simply increas
ing the potential across the device, but eventually hits the me
chanical limits at which highvoltage breakdowns become in
evitable. The ageing is believed to be relate to electroninduced 
deposition of material, particularly hydrocarbons, from the 
background vacuum to the multiplier surfaces, increasing the 
work function as carbon layers are deposited10. MCPs may
