Description:
A prodrug form that can be hydrolyzed by esterases inside the cell.

Inspired by the substrate specificity of SIRT5,24,42,43 we and others have reported on mechanismbased inhibitors 
of SIRT5 that contained carboxylate moieties to mimic the preferred substrate of the enzyme.44,4548 Recently, 
one of our lead compounds (1) was then developed into an ethyl ester prodrug (1Et), which was shown to exhibit 
efficacy against cultured cancer cells (see Figure 1 for structures).41 These investigations indicated that the 
carboxylate moiety of the parent compounds was a major liability with respect to cellular entry, because 
compounds could gain activity in cells upon masking of this functional group, while the simple ester prodrugs are 
likely hydrolyzed by various esterases once inside the cell.
