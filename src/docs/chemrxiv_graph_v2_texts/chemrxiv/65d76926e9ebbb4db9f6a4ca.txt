Has phosphorus-containing analogues studied in recent years.

Text:
The study of phosphoruscontaining 
analogues of nitrogencontaining moieties has grown 
in recent years, with examples including phosphorus 
analogues of pyridine and urea (Figure 1), as well as 
imines, nitriles, and the cyanate and cyanide 
anions.1 When phosphorus is in a lowcoordinate 
environment, it has been shown that it is more 
similar to carbon than to nitrogen, principally due to 
the isolobal nature of P and C and their similar 
electronegativities, resulting in phosphorus being 
dubbed the carbon copy.2 For tricoordinate 
phosphorus, the presence of the lone pair means 
that there are obvious parallels with analogous 
nitrogen compounds, although there is a significantly 
reduced propensity for delocalisation of this lone pair 
in 
the 
former.

For 
example, 
in 
N,N
dimethylformamide (DMF), the nitrogen is planar and 
the methyl groups are inequivalent due to significant 
CN double bond character, whereas in the heavier 
P,Pdimethylformylphosphine the phosphorus moiety 
is pyramidal and there is minimal donation of the 
lone pair into the CO  orbital (Figure 1C).3

functional group in organic chemistry, and can be 
found in dyes and pharmaceuticals, such as the anti
