The position 
of this signal gives the gfactor averaged over all EPRobservable paramagnetic transition metals in the 
system, while its linewidth depends on the strength of the magnetic exchange (J couplings) and dipolar 
interactions between the transition metals, and on the distribution of paramagnetic environments.32 In 
general, the effect of these interactions on the EPR signal linewidth increases in the order of exchange 
coupling, distribution of environments, electronelectron dipolar, to zerofield splitting. In an operando 
EPR experiment, the intensity, gfactor and linewidth of the EPR signal will evolve due to the continuously 
evolving electronic and atomic structure of the cathode during electrochemical cycling. Additionally, 
conduction electrons present in carbon conductive additives used in the formulation of composite 
electrodes, and in metallic anodes (e.g.
