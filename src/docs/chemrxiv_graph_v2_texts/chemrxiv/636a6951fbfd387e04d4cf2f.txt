Description:
Used in the form of activated carbon fibers for composite solid sorbents.

Even in
these cases, however, the vapour concentration generally exceeds 10 gm3, and water molecules
can be extracted from the atmosphere, using a variety of approaches and materials that have
been proposed to this aim, and to a limited extent already deployed for applications.8 A non
exhaustive list includes thermodynamic traps (collectors),9 as well as composite solid sorbents,10
based on complex materials such as activated carbon bres,11 silica gels,12 zeolites,13 metal
organic frameworks (MOFs).1416 The simplest approaches are based on the idea of absorbing
undersaturated water vapour into a suitable hygroscopic material.1719 Besides being limited in
the achievable water concentration, spontaneous absorption is necessarily driven by a decrease
of free energy in going from the vapour to the absorbed state, making the eventual production
of fresh water even more unlikely or more energydemanding than in the starting vapour state.
