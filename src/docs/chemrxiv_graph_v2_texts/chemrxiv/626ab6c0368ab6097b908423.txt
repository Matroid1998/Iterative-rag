Description:
Molecular oxygen is bound and activated through hydrogen bonding.

Text:
of the first amino group to the secondary coordination sphere has the largest stabilization 
effect; more amino groups do not change the results significantly. The amino group can transfer a hydrogen atom to the 
peroxo ligands which results in the OO bond cleavage. This process is thermodynamically favored over the O2 elimination, 
but entropically disfavored. Introduction 
Hydrogen bonding is one of the dominant interactions 
which Nature uses to control structure and reactivity of pro
teins. Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in binding 
and activating of molecular oxygen.
