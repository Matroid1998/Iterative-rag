Description:
An element whose availability affects the chemical and physical degradation of wood.

Text:
Samples were 
collected from areas of the ship which were continuously exposed to water (typically seawater) 
and studied using thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation combined with gas 
chromatographymass spectrometry (THMGCMS). After felling, the chemical and physical degradation of wood depends primarily on environmental 
conditions, including the availability of oxygen and the presence of wooddegrading organisms. 3
