Description:
A wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct band gap of 3.35 eV and large exciton binding energy of 60 meV.

Text:
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a
direct band gap (3.35 eV), large exciton binding energy of 60
meV, which can be doped to show a resistivity of 4.4103
 cm at room temperature. (13) These properties make it
of interest as a potential material for applications in gas sen
sors (4), transistors (5), LEDs (6), photocatalysis (7), ultra
violet lasers (8) and also in solar energy conversion (9). The
controlled derivation of nanoscale shapes and different mor
phologies is of great interest because of the possibility of
tuning the physicochemical properties of these materials re
lated to their surface properties and states. ZnO nanostruc
tures can be synthesized in a number of ways.
