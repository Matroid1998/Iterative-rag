Description:
Components of interest in orange waste valorization.

Text:
Research on orange waste valorization includes 
optimizing extraction methods of components of interest (pectin, essential oils, phenolic acids, and 
flavonoids) and the production of biofuels 2,7,9. Upcycling food losses and waste in their integrity (or bulk waste)  i.e., without chemical 
extraction and purification processes  into biobased materials has emerged as a promising 
strategy within the Green Manufacturing and Engineering approach 10. This strategy reduces the 
use of harsh chemicals in extraction processes, increases yields, and saves processing operations, 
time and energy 8. Importantly, developing agrifood wastebased materials avoids the competition 
for land use with crops intended for food production 10. To date, materials from bulk orange waste are limited to solventcast films 8,1116.
