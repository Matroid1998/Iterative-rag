Description:
Decomposes to release hydrogen with high selectivity.

Also, Singh,S et al
23 showed the generation of hydrogen via the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine (H2NNH2 H2O)
over a bimetallic NickelIridium (NixIr1xB) catalysts. As resulted from the experimental studies, Ni0.95Ir0.05B
and Ni0.90Ir0.10B exhibited the highest selectivity for hydrogen release from hydrous hydrazine. Which was close
to 100 of hydrogen selectivity from H2NNH2 H2O decomposition. Moreover, Both (Ni1xPtx) and (Ni1xPdx)
have been considered as a good catalyst materials for the degradation of hydrous hydrazine as fully described in
24,25. Suitable selectivity (close to 100) was achieved with Pt content as low as 7 mol  and superior to
80 hydrogen selectivity with 40 of Palladium loading respectively.
