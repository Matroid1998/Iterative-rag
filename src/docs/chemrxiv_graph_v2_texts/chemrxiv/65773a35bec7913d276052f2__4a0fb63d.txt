Description:
Thermoplastics often used in extrusion-based 3D printing.

Text:
The liquid materials are injected as droplets 
through nozzles and quickly solidify to form a layer of material based on the path of computeraided 
design (CAD). Materials in fluid phase or suspension type like polymers, nanoparticles, metals, ceramics, 
and biorelated materials are applicable to this method.5 
Extrusion 
Extrusion uses a nozzle to deposit the heated material layer by layer on the path determined by CAD 
software to build up the 3D product. Solid materials like thermoplastics, for instance, polyamides, 
polylactic acid, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS) are often used with this method.6 

Photopolymerization 
One typical example of photopolymerizationbased 3D printing is stereolithography (SLA). SLA uses a 
laser to selectively cure the photopolymer from top to bottom, layer by layer while lowering the 
platform inside the liquid resin tank.
