The past decades have seen a rapid growth of research on the potential applications of
nanoparticles,1 and their assembly as artificial atoms into increasingly complex structures
and composite materials.2,3 Motivated by favourable properties, such as the high density of
active unsaturated atoms residing on their surface,4 and discontinuous effects arising from
their confined electronic band structure,5 nanoparticles and nanoparticle composites are of
specific interest to fields ranging from catalysis6 to nanophotonics.7
One of the more promising aspects of using nanostructured materials is the ability to
combine mixtures of different nanoparticles to improve the performances of the starting ma
terials or even observe emergent properties.8,9 This feature has been regularly exploited in
heterogeneous photocatalysis, where the relatively poor visible light absorption and quan
tum efficiency of base photocatalysts such as TiO2 can be improved by incorporating co
catalyst metal nanoparticles.10,11 Typically, materials are functionalised with nanoparticles
by either synthesising the nanoparticles directly onto the support,12 or by heteroaggregating
presynthesised metal nanoparticles.13 In this second approach, the size and the geometry of
the nanoparticles can be predefined, in turn providing greater control over their functional
ity1416
However, there are significant hurdles still facing the application of nanoparticles to many
realworld situations.
