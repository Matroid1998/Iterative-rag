Description:
Small molecules detected using SWCNTs.

Text:
Thus, SWCNTs have already been used for several bioimaging 
studies18,19 and the detection of numerous analytes such as reactive oxygen species20323, small 
molecules like nitroaromatics24,25 or neurotransmitters26,27, proteins28330, sugars31, 
enzymes32 or bacteria33. Due to their fluorescence in the nearinfrared (NIR, 850 3 1700 nm), 
which shows no bleaching or blinking, they represent stable fluorophores, whose emission falls 
within the biological transparency window34. Here, reduced scattering and autofluorescence 
of biological samples allow for increased signaltonoise ratios (SNR) during detection35.
