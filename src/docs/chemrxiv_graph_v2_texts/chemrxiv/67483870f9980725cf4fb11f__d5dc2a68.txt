Description:
Produced as a propellant through a mature process on Earth, typically requiring high temperatures and pressures.

Text:
For example, the production of Methane as propellant for the back transit is 
25 
a mature process on earth 7, but conventional methanation reactors maximize yield with high 
26 
temperatures and pressures, which require heavy periphery. In this context, the use of recyclable 
27 
Fluoropolymers as an alternative reactor material, though never considered on earth, becomes 
28 
advantageous for Martian exploration due to their reusability and lower density compared to typical 
29 
steel reactors. Moreover, the concept of ISRU requires solid ground to start from. All technology 
30 
contributing to a safe execution of space operations should be robust and somehow tolerant for the 
31 
conditions at the landing site 8.

Description:
Produced from CO2 in low-temperature polymeric reactors.

Text:
Thus, the implementation of polymeric reactors for applications 
32 
beyond earth comes with the challenge of suitable and robust catalysts. 33 
We have recently demonstrated the viability of a polymeric reactor 9 for use in the lowtemperature 
34 
conversion of CO2 to Methane, as well as identified RuTiO2 as the most active catalyst at mild process 
35 
conditions 10. In this study, we expand our previous work by using a RuTiO2 catalyst in both a PTFE 
36 
and PFA based reactor and measure the activity and temperature throughout a wide range of process
