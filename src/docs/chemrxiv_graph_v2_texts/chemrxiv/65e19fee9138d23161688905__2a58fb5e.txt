Description:
A garnet solid-state electrolyte with relatively high Li-ion conductivities, stable in tetragonal form at room temperature.

Text:
To date, arguably the most
well studied garnet SSE is Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) displaying
relatively high Liion conductivities of 106 103 S
cm1 depending on doping, synthesis technique and en
vironment, and the structural phase of LLZO.1217 At room
temperature (RT), the structure is stable in its tetragonal
form(spacegroup I41acd), whilstathighertemperatures
it undergoes a phase transition into the disordered cubic
phase (space group Ia3d) which possesses ionic conduc
tivities around two orders of magnitude higher than the
tetragonal phase.12,18
The wide electrochemical stability window of LLZO al
lows it to benignly contact with Li metal anodes.12,19,20
However, a very thin layer of tetragonallike LLZO structure
has been observed at the interface between cubic LLZO
and Li metal19,21 potentially resulting in a bottleneck to the
Liionconductivityattheelectrolyteanodeinterface.
