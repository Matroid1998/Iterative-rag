Description:
Generated by a cyanobacterium for the oxidation of cyclohexene to cyclohexanol.

Consequently, the external illumination of 
common batch reactors, especially at larger volumes, leads to nonhomogeneous irradiation and 
low reaction rates, as most of the light gets absorbed near the surface of the vessel.28,29 
Performance of lightdependent reactions in continuous flow, in particular in microchannels (ID 
 1 mm), represents a convenient way of circumventing this issue.28,29 Although the performance 
of biocatalytic transformations in continuous flow has been established,3036 examples of flow 
photobiocatalysis remain scarce and are not of synthetic applicability.37 Examples include the 
generation of oxygen by a cyanobacterium for the oxidation of cyclohexene to cyclohexanol,38 
and the photochemical cofactor regeneration for the enzymatic reduction of CO2 to formate.39
