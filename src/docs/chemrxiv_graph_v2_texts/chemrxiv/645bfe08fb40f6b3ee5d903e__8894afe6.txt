Description:
A compound that can be electrochemically converted into hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carbonyl products.

Text:
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) is a promising route to generate valuable fuels and chemical 
feedstocks through the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into hydrocarbon, alcohol, and carbonyl 
products.13 With electricity generated by renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, 
electrochemical CO2 reduction has the potential to become a sustainable approach to produce carbon
based chemicals and fuels, which could replace conventional petrochemical processes, thereby reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and helping to protect the global environment.
