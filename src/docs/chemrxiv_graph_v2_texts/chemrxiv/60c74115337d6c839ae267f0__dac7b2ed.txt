Description:
An element that can form part of atomically thin slabs in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Previously, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) were studied as perspective candidates 
for photoelectrodes with efficiencies up to 17 upon illumination in acidic solutions using n
type single crystals.7,8 The high potential of such layertype semiconductors (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, 
WSe2) is caused by their suitable bandgap energy in the range of 12 eV, a high absorption coef
ficient (105 cm1), and a longterm stability in an acidic electrolyte.7,911 TMDCs are strongly an
isotropic materials which can be mechanically exfoliated into atomically thin XMeX slabs 
(where X  S, Se and Me  Mo, W).12,13 The strong crystallographic anisotropy manifests itself in 
anisotropic electrical transport properties since the electrical and thermal conductivity along 
the van der Waals (vdW) planes is by a factor of up to 100 higher compared to the transport 
perpendicular to the vdW planes.14 So far, it was not possible to transfer the results from small 
(mm2) single crystal electrodes to large area (m2) electrodes composed of polycrystalline, but 
highly oriented layers.
