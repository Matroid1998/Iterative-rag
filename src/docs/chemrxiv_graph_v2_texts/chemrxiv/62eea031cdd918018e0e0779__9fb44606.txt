Description:
Used in air to oxidize interferents in catalytic filters, enhancing sensor selectivity.

Text:
Installing a catalytic lter upstream can mitigate the crosssensitivity of a gas sensor by converting
(e.g., oxidizing 30, using O2 in air) interferents into species that interact more weakly with its
recognition element1 29, 33thereby enhancing the selectivity of the sensing device for the
analyte over the interferent. A catalytic lter can be 29 (i) a tubular reactor packed with
catalyst particles 20 or (ii) a porous, catalytic lm overlaying the recognition element 30,3440. Several catalytic lters have been experimentally demonstrated for diverse gas sensing tasks
involving interferents 20,3540. 1Alternatively, a catalytic lter could convert an analyte that interacts weakly with the recognition element
into a species that interacts more strongly with the recognition element, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the
sensor device to the analyte 31,32. 2
