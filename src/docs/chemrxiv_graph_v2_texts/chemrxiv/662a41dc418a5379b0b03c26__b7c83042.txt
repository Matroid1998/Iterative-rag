In this context, H2O2 stands out as an attractive 
oxidant in light of its atomeconomy and practicality. A versatile 
complex that catalyzes such reactions is derived from the so
called FeTAML family (TAML  Tetra Amide Macrocyclic Ligand). These catalysts were pioneered by Collins and coworkers3. In 
the last 20 years, multiple variations of the TAML scaffold have 
been explored in the pursuit of oxidation catalysts with 
significantlyimproved performance3. An alternative approach to enhance the catalytic activity of metal 
catalysts involves the development of artificial metalloenzymes 
(ArMs)4. Combining the attractive features of both homogeneous 
catalysis and biocatalysis, ArMs leverage a unique and well
defined environment provided by the protein scaffold upon 
incorporating a nonnative cofactor.
