Description:
Can resist even higher temperatures than pure silicon.

In our world today, we have a variety of materials that are extremely advantageous to the
ever growing semiconductor industry. From our current silicon age, there is pure silicon, which
has both conductive and insulating properties, as well as its alternative silicon carbide, which can
resist even higher temperatures than the pure form of silicon. However, one major disadvantage
in the current silicon age as well as in the production of multiple other materials is the high
energy cost. As our world continues to develop in the semiconductor industry, newer materials
will need to be developed with properties similar to those of silicon carbide and pure silicon
while also being easier to obtain.
