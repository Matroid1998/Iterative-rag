Description:
A rare transition metal terminal carbide from Group 6.

Text:
Transition metal terminal carbides are exceedingly rare.1 The handful of examples known to 
date hail from Groups 6 and 8, including N(R)Ar3Mo(C) (Tp  3,5
dimethyltris(pyrazolyl)borate) and Tp(CO)2M(CLi) (M  W, Mo),2,3,4,5 M(C)(L)2(X)2 
(M  Ru, Os),6,7,8,9 and P2Mo(C)(CO),0, (P2  a terphenyldiphosphine ligand).10,11 For 
squarepyramidal and octahedral complexes, a carbido wall (analogous to the oxo wall) 
appears to apply at a delectron of 2, corresponding to a dd2 electronic configuration. Thus, an 
Ir(VII)carbido corrole has been postulated as a stable species. Higher delectron counts of up 
to 4 are conceivable for pseudotetrahedral complexes, corresponding to a dd4 electronic 
configuration. Little, however, is known about the actual stability of such complexes or about 
their excitedstate architectures.
