The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is 
particularly attractive due to i) its efficiency, ii) the possibility of using renewable electricity, iii) its 
controllable selectivity by adjusting the electrode potential, and iv) the use of compact, highly efficient, 
modular and scalable reaction systems for the synthesis of a variety of products.14 
Among the various CO2RR products, CO has been considered one of the most commercially viable 
because of its kinetically accessible process (twoprotons and twoelectrons reaction) and high 
efficiency.5,6 CO is a very versatile raw material in the industry it is the main component of synthesis 
gas (a mixture of CO and H2) and utilized to produce a series of essential organic chemical products 
and intermediates including alcohols, acids, anhydrides, esters, aldehydes, ethers, amines, alkanes, 
and alkenes.
