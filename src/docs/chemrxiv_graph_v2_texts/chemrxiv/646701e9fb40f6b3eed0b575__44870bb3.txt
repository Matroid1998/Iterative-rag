Introduction 

()Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG 1) is the most abundant catechin in green tea leaves and 
exhibits various biological activities, including anticancer and antiallergic effects.1 The 67kDa 
laminin receptor (67LR) has been identified as a receptor for EGCG, mediating its therapeutic actions.2 
Studies on naturally occurring EGCGrelated compounds have suggested that the gallate moiety (D 
ring) is a crucial pharmacophore for 67LR binding.3 Furthermore, a combinatorial synthesis and 
biological evaluation of methylated EGCG have demonstrated that methylation of the hydroxy group 
at the A and B rings does not significantly reduce biological activity.4,5 These results suggested that 
the A or B ring is a suitable position of EGCG for modification with functional groups, such as
