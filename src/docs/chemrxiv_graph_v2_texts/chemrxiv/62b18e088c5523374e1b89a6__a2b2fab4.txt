Description:
Exhibits reactivity that can be lost during redox activity.

In addition to its applications in fragmentbased ligand

discovery, ISOTOPABPP has been adapted to investigate the cysteine redoxome, including as 
H2O2sensitive cysteines in bacteria44, and Snitrosation sites in MCF7 cell lysates45. ISOTOP
ABPP has also been used to identify redoxactive cysteines in isolated organelles such as 
mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum46,47. A UVcaged version of the IAalkyne probe 
minimizes cytotoxicity of the alkylating agent enabling in situ cysteine labeling48. More recently, 
an optimized workflow termed SLCABPP reduces instrument time and input material, achieving 
a depth of 8,000 reactive cysteine sites49. Future implementation of SLCABPP in redox biology 
is greatly anticipated; however, it is essential to note that ISOTOPABBP and related derivatives 
identify redox activity as a loss of thiolate reactivity and provide no information regarding OxiPTM 
identity.
