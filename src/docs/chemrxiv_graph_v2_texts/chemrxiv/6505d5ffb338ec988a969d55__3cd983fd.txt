Description:
A substrate for nitric oxide synthase that is enzymatically degraded to produce nitric oxide.

Text:
Consequently, 
NO is endogenously produced on the target site, at the specific 
dose and at any time when necessary, through the enzymatic 
degradation of Larginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS).3 
Due to its ubiquitous physiological activity in humans, the 
biological roles of NO and its potential as a drug have been the 
focus of intense cell biology and medical research during the 
last decades.4 In this regard, the development of materials that 
enable the ondemand generation of exogenous NO with a 
spatiotemporally controlled gas release is a key aspect for the 
successful progression of both research fields.
