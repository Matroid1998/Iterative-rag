Electrical energy storage devices have proven to be key in the 
transition from conventional fossil fuels because they can 
efficiently store the electricity generated from renewable 
sources, helping to mitigate climate change. Lithiumion 
batteries (LIBs) are among the most promising electrochemical 
energy storage devices due to their superior performance 
compared to other conventional rechargeable batteries, 
widespread use in portable electronics, and potential for the 
development of longrange electric vehicles.1,2 However, 
current 
stateoftheart 
of 
LIBs 
presents 
significant 
development bottlenecks in terms of efficiency and raw 
materials availability. For instance, transition metal oxide 
cathode materials have energy density limitations that are 
constrained by their specific capacities (e.g., 140 mAh g1 for 
LiCoO2).
