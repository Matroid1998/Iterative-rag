Description:
Undergoes tail selective attack at the CH2 position by lithium thiocarboxylate.

This regioselectivity pointed 
towards a close mechanistic relation to Werners 
CS2epoxide ROCOP (ESI Figure S1) which led us 
to propose the reaction mechanism displayed in 
Figure 1. Starting from a Lithium alkoxide 
intermediate ATT insertion of PTA generates a 
Lithium thiocarboxylate TC in propagation step (1). The intermediate TC then selectively attacks at the 
CH2 position of another epoxide in reaction step 
(2) which is commonly termed a tail selective 
attack. This forms a secondary Lithium alkoxide 
ATE that sits adjacent to a thioester link. The 
Lithium alkoxide ATE intramolecularly attacks the 
adjacent thioester group in step (3) to form a
