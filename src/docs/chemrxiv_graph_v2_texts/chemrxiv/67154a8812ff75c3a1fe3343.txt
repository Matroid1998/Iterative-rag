Introduction 
Continuousflow reactors are widely employed for photochemical reactions due to their numerous 
advantages, including small dimensions and enhanced process control.13 The merging of a liquid 
reaction mixture with a gas phase in these reactors to form gasliquid systems has significantly expanded 
the options for synthetic organic chemists, providing a means to mitigate gasliquid mass transfer 
limitations.4,5 Gaseous reagents offer distinct benefits, being atomefficient, costeffective, and 
simplifying downstream separation processes. These advantages are demonstrated in various 
photochemical applications such as singlet oxygen chemistry, carbonylations, and light alkane 
activation.612 Additionally, inert gases are sometimes introduced to create segmented flow, improving 
mixing in the liquid phase. This approach has been shown to enhance residence time distribution 
properties and stabilize solid suspensions.1315
