Description:
Involved in dehydrogenation and hydrogen transfer steps in the Kagan mechanism.

After the Second World War, 
petroleumbased processes took over 1, and research on the subject declined until the last 10
15 years. Nowadays, a blooming interest in biobased processes for the substitution of the 
petroleum industry is observed 36. In this context, the Lebedev process is considered more 
interesting from an environmental and economic point of view compared to the Ostromislensky 
3. For acid catalysts, the generally accepted reaction mechanism is the Kagan mechanism, 
consisting of a complex network of dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer and dehydration steps 
(Scheme 1) 17, 18. To trigger the different types of reactions and obtain butadiene, a bifunctional
