Description:
A key element involved in carbon capture processes to control CO2 release.

Text:
In 2023, the atmospheric CO2 concentration stands at over 421 ppm.1 This is a significant
increase since the preindustrial era and such increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration has been
linked to observable global temperature increase (global warming). The shift towards green
energy as a way to reduce the release of CO2 is being implemented, but arguably not rapid
enough. Carbon capture from point sources such as fossil fuelbased power plants as other
industrial processes is still a crucial factor in controlling the CO2 release into the atmosphere in a
short to medium term prospective. Adsorption processes and a number of solid sorbents have been investigated as an alternative to
the current CO2 capture technology  liquid aminebased CO2 scrubbing.
