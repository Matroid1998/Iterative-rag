Systems that significantly influence chemical properties in both electronic ground and excited states.

Thiosubstituted carbonyl systems have attracted significant due to their strong influence on
chemical properties in both electronic ground and excited states.15 Thiosubstituted nucle
obases, in particular, have been studied extensively for their biological significance and ap
plications in photochemotherapeutics.69 Many of these photoinduced processes are driven
by intersystem crossing (ISC) and nonadiabatic dynamics in triplet states.6,1013 Investiga
tions of the electronic structures of these longlived triplet states and understanding how
the excited state dynamics (ESMD) is influenced by chemical and environmental factors
can provide critical insights useful for designing photochemical processes tailored to specific
applications. The radiationless transitions between singlettriplet states are governed by spinorbit
coupling (SOC).
