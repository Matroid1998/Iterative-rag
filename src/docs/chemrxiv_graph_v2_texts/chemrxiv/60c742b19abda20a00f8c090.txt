Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to atmospheric increase.

Text:
The development of greener and more sustainable processes has been a major focus of 
research and industrial activities in process development due to a number of important 
reasons realisation of the contribution of industry on the increase of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide (CO2), the depletion of reserves of fossil feedstocks, and increasing problems with 
waste management.1,2 A key concept for the future sustainable society is the development of 
circular industrial structures29 which requires the integration of waste process streams as 
feedstocks.1012 This results in feedstock components that are both new to the supply chain, 
and are highly functionalised.
