Description:
Involved in the application of ethyl pmethoxycinnamate and derivatives in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells.

Text:
4Propoxy ringsubstituted ethyl PCA was reported in 
sustainable CC bond formation through Knoevenagel reaction catalyzed by MgObased 
catalysts 8. 4Butoxy ethyl PCA was involved in application of ethyl pmethoxycinnamate 
and derivatives in maintaining selfrenewal and pluripotency of stem cells 9; in Michael 
reaction in synthesis of 6amino4(4butoxyphenyl)3,5dicyanopyridine2(1H)thione 
10; and synthesis of (arylmethylene)cyanothioacetamides 11. 2Methoxyethyl ester of 2
cyano2propanoic acid was involved in sustained drug release and cancer treatment by an 
injectable and biodegradable cyanoacrylatebased local drug delivery system 12; in 
controlled living anionic polymerization of cyanoacrylates by frustrated Lewis pair based
