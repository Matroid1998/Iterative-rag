Description:
Possesses large spontaneous polarization when hexagonal AlN is considered as paraelectric phase.

In
this regard, the recent discovery of ferroelectricity in
CMOS compatible doped wAlN is highly promising be
cause of its high polarization and Curie temperature5
8.
wAlN posses large spontaneous polarization (130
Ccm2) when hexagonal AlN is considered as paraelec
tric phase7, 8. However, because of the high coercive
field, which is larger than its dielectric breakdown volt
age, FE switching in pure wAlN is impractical. Promis
ingly, the substitution of Al by Sc or codoping of Li and
VNbTa, is an effective way to lower the polarization
switching voltage58. Recently, ferroelectricity with
large polarization (125 Ccm2) was demonstrated in
Boron substituted wAlN thin films9, with Boron con
centrations in the range of 2  15.

Description:
Unlike BN, it does not have a centrosymmetric planar hexagonal crystal structure.

Text:
However, a degra
dation in the ferroelectric response has been reported
for B concentrations above 15. Unlike AlN, BN has a
centrosymmetric planar hexagonal crystal structure, and
therefore hBN is nonFE and nonpiezoelectric. In this
mda.alamtyndall.ie; michael.nolantyndall.ie
paper we pose the research question can substitution of
boron by another trivalent element be used to engineer
ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in hBN by breaking
its centrosymmetry? hBN is a layered material with high thermal and
chemical stability, widely used as dielectric substrate
and protective coating layers in 2D materials based
devices3, 10 e.g. graphenehBN FET11. Due to
its van der Waals layered structure, hBN can be syn
thesized as fewlayer or even singlelayer sheets.
