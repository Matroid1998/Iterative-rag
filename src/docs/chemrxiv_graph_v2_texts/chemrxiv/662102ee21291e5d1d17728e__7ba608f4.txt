Description:
An element that can be a component of MXenes as carbonitride.

MXene, a twodimensional transition metal carbide, nitride, or carbonitride, has received a tremendous 
amount of research attention since its discovery in 2011.1 The high specific surface area, hydrophilicity, 
conductivity and mechanical strength of MXenes make them promising for applications including energy 
storage,27 electromagnetic interference shielding,810 and catalysis11. MXenes can be described as a hexagonal 
closed packed structure comprising of Mn1XnTx (n1 to 4; where M is early d block transition metal; X is 
carbon or nitrogen; T is surface terminated groups such as O, OH, Cl, and F, depending on the chemical 
etchant).12 Terminal group free MXenes (Mn1XnT0) are determined to have D3d symmetry.13 However, the 
presence of the terminal groups distorts the symmetry of the unit cell.
