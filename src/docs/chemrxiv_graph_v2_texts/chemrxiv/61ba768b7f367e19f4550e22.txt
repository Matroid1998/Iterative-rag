Description:
An organic semiconductor molecule that exhibits cooperative transitions leading to fast switching of electronics and large recoverable crystal shape change.

A key distinction from nucleation and growth rises from interactions with defects within the 
crystal, which results in avalanche behavior due to pinning of the phase boundary4,1114. While cooperative 
behavior has been well documented in metal alloy based martensitic transitions, it has rarely been 
reported in molecular crystals. As such, the fundamental origin of cooperativity in organic crystals is not 
well understood and the molecular design inducing this behavior is still unknown. Recently, cooperative transitions have been observed in key organic semiconductor molecules such as 
6,13bis(triisopropylsilylethnyl) pentacene (TIPSP), among other ptype semiconductors9,15,16. Cooperativity in TIPSP led to fast switching of the electronics17 coupled with large recoverable crystal 
shape change15, resulting in super and ferroelastic mechanical effects18.
