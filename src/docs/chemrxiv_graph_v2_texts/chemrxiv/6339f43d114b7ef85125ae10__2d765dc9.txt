Description:
Has a low isotopic abundance, making it challenging to incorporate 15N through chemical synthesis.

In contrast to the ready 
access to 15N labelled proteins afforded through expression in 15N enriched media, it is more challenging 
and costly, to incorporate 15N through chemical synthesis. Despite clear advantages, the low abundance 
of 15N (isotopic abundance  (3.46  4.21)  103 molar fraction) renders development of spectroscopic 
methods that do not rely on enrichment, desirable for identification of hydrogenbonds. This need is fur
ther emphasized by the considerable effort currently devoted to the study of multicomponent selfsorting 
assemblies4045 and systems chemistry,4648 where characterization of speciation is challenging. In this 
work, we demonstrate that J coupling between hydrogenbonded nitrogen and hydrogen nuclei in Het
eronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence (HMQC) experiments, allows observation of intra and intermo
lecular hydrogen bonds in diverse supramolecular architectures e.g.
