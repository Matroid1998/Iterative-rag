Description:
Interacts with cosmic rays resulting in secondary UV photons from deexcitation.

Text:
In cold shielded regions such as molecular clouds, external UV photons are
shielded; however, the interaction of H2 with cosmic rays results in secondary UV
photons from the deexcitation of H2 molecules (Ly radiation) 31. As a result, Ly
 radiation is a dominant source of energy and the photochemical processing of ice
is hypothesized to play an important role in the large variety of organic molecules
observed in these areas 8, 23. An important example is the formation of O(1D) as a result of photolysis of water
(H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) ice (with efficiencies of 10 and 100, respectively.) Thus, the chemistry of O(1D) insertion reactions is a possible source of many organic
