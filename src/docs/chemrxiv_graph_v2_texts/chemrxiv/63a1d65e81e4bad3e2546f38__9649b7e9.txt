Description:
Frequently occurring bonds in lignin, especially the O4 bond, that are split during extraction processes.

Text:
The different extraction processes change lignin in such a way that technical lignin differs from 
40 
natural lignin. Especially the frequently occurring ether bonds in lignin, above all the O4 bond, are split3. 41 
However, despite this modification, the general problem of the complex structure is hardly resolved. The 
42 
pulping processes can additionally influence the type and number of reactive sites as well as the 
43 
polydispersity due to repolymerisation reactions4. Lignosulfonates (1000  400000 gmol) have the widest 
44 
range of polydispersities. Kraft lignin (1500  25000 gmol), soda lignin (1000  15000 gmol), and 
45 
organosolv lignins (500  5000 gmol) mostly have lower values for Mw (weight average molar mass) and 
46 
a narrower polydispersity5.
