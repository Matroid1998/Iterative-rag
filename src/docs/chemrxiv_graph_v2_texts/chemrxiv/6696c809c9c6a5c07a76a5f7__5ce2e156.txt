Description:
One of the largest contributors to anthropogenic methane emissions through coal mining.

Text:
Methane has a shorter atmospheric lifetime, but significantly higher heattrapping potential com
pared to carbon dioxide (CO2). As a result, methane reduction actions taken today will have a more
significant shortterm impact than CO2 reduction efforts. Human activities are responsible for ap
proximately 60 of global methane, with the oil and gas, agriculture (including fermentation, manure
management, and rice cultivation), landfills, wastewater treatment, and coal mining industries as the
largest contributors to anthropogenic methane emissions 1. In 2022, natural gas and petroleum systems were responsible for 28 of US methane emissions 1. Tackling oil and gas methane emissions is considered as one of the most economically and technically
effective ways of lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the near term 2.
