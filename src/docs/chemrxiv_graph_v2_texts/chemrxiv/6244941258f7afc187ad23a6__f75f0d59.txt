Description:
Compounds assembled through iterative coupling of alkene building blocks via Suzuki-Miyaura reactions.

In contrast, general, automated methodologies for CC bond formation have not yet emerged 
3 
due to the complexity and variety of organic molecules. However, some progress in automated organic 
synthesis has been achieved but only in the preparation of relatively simple targets;512 the field is still 
nascent. A notable example from Burke reported the iterative assembly of polyenes, where alkene building 
6 
blocks were coupled together through SuzukiMiyaura reactions of MIDA boronates.13 In this example, 
C(sp2)C(sp2) bonds were formed and a maximum of three iterations were described. Recently, the same 
group reported C(sp3)C(sp3) bondforming reactions in an automated fashion but, again only a small 
9 
number (two) of automated iterations were described.14
