Description:
A compound involved in sunlight-driven reduction processes for renewable fuel and chemical generation.

Photocatalysis offers a pathway for green energy and chemical industry alternatives such
16
as sunlightdriven water splitting and CO2 reduction. In such processes, solartochemical
17
energy conversion provides the driving force to generate renewable fuels and chemicals as a
18
promising solution to the energy and environmental crisis. In short, vastly available sunlight
19
in a photocatalytic system is absorbed, followed by photogeneration of separated charge
20
carriers in the material valence (VB) and conduction (CB) bands. These charge carriers can
21
participate in the desired surface reactions.1,2

Whether the promise of a photocatalysisbased sustainable future can reach industrial
23
plants strongly depends on finding a material that can optimally fulfill requirements for each
24
step of a photocatalytic process.
