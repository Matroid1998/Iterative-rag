Description:
A wurtzite material that can be engineered via alloying and straining.

Text:
One is to further engineer
known wurtzite materials like AlN and ZnO via al
loying and straining4, 7, 8, 10, 12, while the other
is to explore and develop new wurtzite(type) mate
rials that have lower coercive fields11, 13, 14. Ul
timately, the goal is to identify the underlying po
larization switching mechanisms and the structure
property relationships that control Ec. In this pa
per, we focus on pathways for polarization reversal;
in other words, what deviations from the baseline
wurtzite structure are involved in the transition from
a positivepolarity wurtzite (wz) to the equivalent
negativepolarity wurtzite (wz)?
