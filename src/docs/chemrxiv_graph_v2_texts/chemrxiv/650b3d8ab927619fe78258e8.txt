Description:
Used in fuel cells for electric vehicles, though it suffers from high fuel costs due to unfavorable round trip efficiencies.

The electrication of transportation devices is widely regarded as crucial for the transition
towards renewable energy systems13 but, while electric vehicles (EV) based on hydrogen
fuel cells continuously suer from high fuel costs due to unfavorable round trip eciencies,4,5
the price for Liion batteries, scaled by their energy capacity, has been reduced by about
97  since market introduction in 1991, accompanied by signicant performance gains. 6
Accordingly, the growth of the battery market for light duty EVs exceeds all expectations 79
and batteries are at least considered as viable options for heavy duty EVs10 and short to
medium distance shipping.11 The consequence of this ongoing trend is the steeply rising
demand for the materials used, escalating all the environmental, geopolitical and social
challenges in their acquisition.
