Description:
Organic compounds with diradical character, extensively investigated.

Text:
Organic compounds displaying diradical char
acter have long fascinated chemists, as they
provide unique platforms for investigating the
nature of the chemical bond and other fun
damental organic concepts. Classic exam
ples
include
Tschitschibabins
hydrocarbon,
bisphenalenyls, zethrenes, and indenofluorenes
(Figure 1), which have all been extensively in
vestigated both computationally17 and experi
mentally.24,812 It is unsurprising that the ma
jority of longlived, synthetically accessible or
ganic compounds with openshell character are
polycyclic aromatic systems (PASs). In such
systems, termed proaromatic by Wu and
coworkers,13 the closedshell resonance struc
ture (RS) is quinoidal whereas the openshell
RS contains additional disjoint 6 electrons
rings (compare the left and right RSs in Figure
1; the diradical RSs contain additional Clar sex
