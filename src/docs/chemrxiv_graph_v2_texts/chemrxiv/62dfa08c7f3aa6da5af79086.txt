Description:
Commonly used as a substrate in optoelectronic applications.

Text:
The optoelectronic properties of multinary IIIV semiconductors, their tunable band gap, 
reliable control of doping concentrations, and the formation of functional heterostructures such 
as tunnel junctions make them promising candidates for various highperformance device 
applications, e.g tandem photovoltaic devices, 13 or photoelectrodes.46 Commonly, Ge(100) 
or GaAs(100) substrates, GaInP, and GaAs buffer layers play key roles in these architectures.

Description:
A substrate material used for growing GaInP(100) in semiconductor devices.

However, inevitably, the buried interfaces inside IIIV semiconductor devices are not 
straightforward to characterize with modern surface science methods.10 As a firstofitskind 
study of the relevant AlInPGaInP (100) interface11,12 we present here an experimental 
investigation by Tapered CrossSection Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TCSPES) of GaInP(100) 
grown on Ge(100) and GaAs(100) substrates.
