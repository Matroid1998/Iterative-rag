Description:
A planar conjugated system exhibiting 3D aromaticity by stacking of molecules.

There have 
been several reports that the stacking of aromatic compounds can modify their intrinsic properties such 
as conductiveenergy transfer properties5,6 and absorptionemission properties due to the formation of 
H or Jaggregates.7,8 Recently, a unique property of threedimensional (3D) aromaticity based on 
stacked antiaromatic molecules has been reported by Shinokubo et al (Figure 1a).9,10 A similar 3D 
(anti)aromaticity was also predicted by closely stacked aromatic units,1113 and thus the stacking of 
planar systems is key for the development of molecules with novel functions. Figure 1. Previous examples (a) norcorrole with a planar conjugated system exhibiting 3Daromaticity 
by stacking of molecules and (b) redoxactive cationic dyes with a propellerlike or twisted geometry, 
which is not suitable for stacking themselves.
