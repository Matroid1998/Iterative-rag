Description:
An organic solvent used to dissolve amphiphilic block copolymers for nanoaggregate formation.

Text:
Thereby, when an amphiphilic BCP is dissolved in organic solvent (THF) and mixed under precise flow conditions with 
water, nanoaggregates of various size and form are obtained. Important in this process is not only the exact geometry of the flow 
reactor setup, and most specifically the employed mixer unit, but also the concentration of the polymer solution, the flow rate and 
the mixing ratio with water. In a recent study, we exploited this reproducibility by introducing dynamic light scattering (DLS) as 
online monitor to provide parameter space screening in an autonomous fashion.16 Next to our platform also other advances have 
been made to realize online monitoring systems for particle formation. Meulendijks et al. used online DLS to monitor the batch
