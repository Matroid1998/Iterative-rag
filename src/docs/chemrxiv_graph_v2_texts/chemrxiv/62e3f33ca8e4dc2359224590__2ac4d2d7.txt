Description:
Complexes inhibit monoamine oxidase B, preventing some neurodegenerative diseases.

The movement of Cr3 in living organisms depends considerably on the complexation of the metal 
center by chelating nitrogen donor ligands. Cr3 cysteine and hydrazide complexes, on the other hand, 
have noticeable antibacterial and antifungal activities. Sulfonamides, Sulfanilamide derivatives and 
cephapirin with Cr3 complexes showed good antimicrobial properties. Monoamine oxidaseB 
inhibition by Cr3 triethanolamine complexes leads to the prevention of some neurodegenerative 
diseases. The activities of compounds obtained from plants and their metal complexes can be detected by the 
same conventional methods based on the same principle and are not equally efficient and sensitive. It is 
clear that biological evaluation, in general, can be carried out much more proficiently on watersoluble, 
nice crystalline complexes than on mixtures like plant exudate (Zaidi et al. 2012).
