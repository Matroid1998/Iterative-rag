Description:
Undergo hydroboration as a synthetic route to organoboron compounds.

Text:
For 
example, the compound class is widely used in organic synthesis for, e.g., the powerful 
SuzukiMiyaura crosscoupling as well as for ChanLam couplings.14 In the context 
of medicinal chemistry, the introduction of boronic acids can improve activity andor 
pharmacokinetic properties,59 whereas the reversible dynamic covalent bonds of 
boronic esters have enabled the synthesis of selfhealing macromolecular 
materials.10 There are various synthetic routes to organoboron compounds, e.g., 
hydroboration of olefins,1113 addition of organometallic nucleophiles to boron 
electrophiles.14 Furthermore, borylative crosscouplings using transition metal 
catalysis are known for starting materials such as aryl and alkyl halides1527 redox 
active Nhydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters (RAEs),28 and derivatives of amines, 
alcohols and thiols.29 In context of the latter, sulfonium salts are the most common
