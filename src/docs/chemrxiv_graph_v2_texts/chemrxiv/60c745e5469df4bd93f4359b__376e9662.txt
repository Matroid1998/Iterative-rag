Description:
Forms gels in organic solvents upon rapid cooling.

Text:
Polymers with UCST behavior reversibly phase 
separate upon cooling, typically leading to precipitation. In some cases, precipitation does not 
occur, instead a gel is formed. UCSTtype behavior can be observed in solvent mixtures and, 
though much more rarely, in water.58 Already in 1979, Wellinghoff et al. described a 
poly(styrene) and poly(dimethylphenylene oxide) system which forms gels in organic solvents 
upon rapid cooling.9 In 2015 a thixotropic poly(glycerol sebacate)based supramolecular 
structure with UCST behavior was reported to form a hydrogel at rather low concentrations (5.2 
) with selfhealing ability with a storage modulus of 100 kPa.
