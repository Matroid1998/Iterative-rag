Description:
Its LJ parameters were optimized to reproduce hydration free energy and molar volume of CHF3.

Text:
The LJ parameters of uorine
were optimized to reproduce the hydration free energies of CF4
and the molar volume of a 50 mix of CF4 and CH4; subse
quently, those of HF were optimized to reproduce the hydra
tion free energy and the molar volume of CHF3. Atomic par
tial charges were obtained following the GAFF (small molecules)
