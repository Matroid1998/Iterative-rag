Description:
A component of phthalaldehyde and phenylenediamine moieties with C atoms resonating during 100-160 ppm in 13C NMR spectra.

Text:
The resonances during 100160 ppm in 13C 
crosspolarization (CP) magicangle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra corresponded to the C 
atoms on the benzene rings from the phthalaldehyde and phenylenediamine moieties 
(Figure S5), confirming the substitution relationships on the benzene ring of the respective 
three PPIs. Noting that the resonances at around 150 ppm were attributed to the C atoms 
in the imine groups. To distinguish the bulk phase structures, three PPIs were characterized by powder Xray 
diffraction (PXRD). Both PDAPAH and PDAMAH were highly crystalline while MDAMAH
