Description:
A reagent used to treat enoxysilane to form a radical precursor.

Vicinal 
difunctionalization with a vinyl cuprate nucleophile and enolate trapping with HC(OMe)3 provided 
20 
19. Adduct 19 underwent a Robinson annulation with ethyl vinyl ketone (EVK) to afford 20. An 

7 

enoneselective Pdcatalyzed hydrosilylation of 20 (27) provided 21. These newly developed 
conditions were necessary as Pt, Cu, and Rh catalysts provided inferior results. Treatment of the 
enoxysilane 21 with PhSeCl provided the radical precursor 22 as an inconsequential mixture of 
diastereomers. When 22 was subjected to optimized radical cyclization conditions (AIBN, nBu3SnH), 
5 
clovan2,9dione (1) was produced in 45 yield. This result is in excellent agreement with the 
predicted yield of 46. Since the literature examples used to train the NNET model are generally 
optimized yields, the predictions are for optimized yields as well.
