Description:
A gas whose concentration is reduced by the release of carbon dioxide or ammonia during decomposition.

Theoretical review on the stateof art 
General mode of actions reported in the literature 1, 2 for different HFFR additives could mainly be 
summarized as 1) heat sink or endothermic effects where the additive absorbs a large amount of 
heat during decomposition without releasing flammable volatiles and cooling the polymer, 2) 
dilution affect where the additive releases water, carbon dioxide or ammonia on decomposition 
thereby reducing both the concentration of oxygen and combustibles around the polymers, 3) 
covering effect where the additive forms a nonflammable protective layer blocking diffusion of 
oxygen and heat to the burning surface and finally 4) inhibition effect where the additive generate 
radicals in the gas phase that could combine with the reactive radicals released by the polymer to 
interrupt the chain reactions for the burning process.
