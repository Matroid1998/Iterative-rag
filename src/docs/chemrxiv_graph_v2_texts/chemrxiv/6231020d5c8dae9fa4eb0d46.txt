Description:
Used in a magnesium-free buffer to electrostatically stabilize forming DNA structures while allowing reconfigurability.

In this work, we show that the major methods 
of structural DNA nanotechnology, including DNA origamis,2 DNA nanogrids3 and SST 
assemblies,4 can now be operated by the same generic isothermal DNA selfassembly principle, 
leading to a breadth of userdefined elaborate DNA nanostructures that can be spontaneously 
formed at room or body temperature, keeping intrinsic reconfigurability and a capability of 
massive transformation never achieved so far. By using a magnesiumfree buffer containing 
NaCl to electrostatically stabilize the forming structures while allowing enough 
reconfigurability, we established the range of temperatures and salt concentrations where the
