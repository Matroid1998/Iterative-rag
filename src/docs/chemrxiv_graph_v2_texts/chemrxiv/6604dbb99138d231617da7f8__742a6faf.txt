Description:
A novel compound synthesized through the reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitrile.

In sharp contrast, the bioisosteres of pyridine, the second most common aromatic ring 
appearing in drugs10,33, have received less attention and surprisingly encountered trivial 
success. A notable example was recently disclosed by Mykhailiuk, wherein a novel type of 
3azabicyclo3.1.1heptanes was synthesized through the reduction of spirocyclic 
oxetanyl nitrile. The resulting fragment was proposed to mimic 3,5disubstituted 
pyridines (Fig. 1a)34. As the most common sixmembered aromatics, pyridine and benzene should, in principle, 
share a similar strategy for 3D bioisosterism. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that 
the basicity of the sp2N in pyridine plays a vital role in ligandprotein recognition35. The 
complete saturation of pyridine would alter the hybridization of the nitrogen atom
