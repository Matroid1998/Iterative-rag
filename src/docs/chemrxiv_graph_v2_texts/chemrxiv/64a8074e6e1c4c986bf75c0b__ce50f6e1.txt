Description:
Heteroaromatic compounds used in developing solid-state mechanoresponsive RTP materials and solvent-free liquid RTP materials.

Text:
Using heteroaromatic 1,2diketones, we previously developed a 
series of solidstate mechanoresponsive RTP materials,15 solvent
free liquid RTP materials,16 and photoresponsive RTP crystals.17 
They exhibited RTP under nonrigid molecular environments, such 
as amorphous solids or solventfree liquids. Considering that typical 
metalfree organic compounds rarely show RTP under these condi
tions, our results were encouraging enough to expect large kps for 
those diketones; however, their inherent molecular RTP properties 
have not been fully investigated. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023h17m5 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000313265457 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
