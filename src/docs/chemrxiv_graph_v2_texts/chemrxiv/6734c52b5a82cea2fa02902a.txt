Description:
A metal that becomes transparent to visible light when compressed above 120 GPa, indicating the opening of a bandgap.

Text:
Understanding the behavior of matter under extreme compression remains a grand challenge in physics, 
planetary and materials science. It was long assumed that increasing pressure causes all matter to become 
metallic, comprising ionic cores arranged in closepacked lattices and free electrons (Lai et al., 1991). However, experimental results have shown that this view might be incomplete. Sodium, which at ambient 
pressure is a metal, becomes transparent to visible light when compressed above a pressure of 120 GPa 
(Ma et al., 2009). The transparency is indicative of the opening of a bandgap, meaning the valence 
electrons are no longer able to move freely in the conduction bands (Ashcroft  Mermin, 1976).

Description:
Becomes a semiconductor under extreme compression.

Text:
Indeed, 
the calculated bandgap for this new phase of sodium, named NahP4, is 1.3 eV; therefore, sodium 
becomes a semiconductor under extreme compression (Ma et al., 2009). In fact, sodium becomes a high
pressure electride (HPE), as consequence of the reordering of the valence orbitals, which form 3(s)pd 
hybrid orbitals, whose overlap results in the formation of a multicentered bond and concomitant 
localization of electron density in interstitial sites (Racioppi, Storm et al., 2023). A more simplistic model 
has viewed the electrons as being transferred from the Na atom to socalled interstitial quasi atoms (ISQ) 
(Miao  Hoffmann, 2014). Though conceptually appealing, this model is not fully supported by detailed 
analysis of the electronic structure(Racioppi  Zurek, 2024). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024xwcv5 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000241741732 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
