An important class of organic compounds with applications in material science, medicinal chemistry, and synthetic organic chemistry.

The direct functionalization of remote CH bonds of organic 
molecules remains a significant challenge due to their inherent 
poor reactivity.1 The transition metal (TM) catalyzed CH bond 
functionalization has emerged as a powerful platform in organic 
chemistry to overcome this challenge.2 Many efforts have been 
focused on developing novel TMcatalysed synthetic protocols, 
mainly where specific starting aryl halides are inaccessible.3 
The methodology has notable applications in synthesizing fine 
chemicals, functional molecules, natural products, and drug 
molecules.4 Although directing group (DG)assisted CH bond 
activation of proximal orthoCH bonds is well explored in the 
last two decades, selective activation of CH bonds beyond 
proximity remains a challenge.3d,5 
Quinolines are an important class of organic compounds 
due to their broad applications in material science, medicinal 
chemistry, and synthetic organic chemistry.6 Remarkable 
progress has been made for their NNO directed siteselective 
CH bond functionalization.7 Li8 and Chang9 group have 
independently demonstrated the role of NO as a DG and an 
Oatom source.
