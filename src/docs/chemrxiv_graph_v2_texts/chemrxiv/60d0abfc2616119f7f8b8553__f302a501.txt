Recently, oxide glasses with polyvalent ions as risingstar electrode materials for lithiumion 
batteries (LIBs) have aroused considerable research interest 17. Particularly, the successful attempt 
of Idotas group 8 to apply SnO2based glass as anode material for LIBs signified both the 
fascination and importance of the oxide glass anodes and resulted in advances in energy storage 
technology. In terms of microstructure, oxide glass possesses various advantages for serving as 
electrode material13 and these unique features render it a bright future for diverse applications in 
energy storage devices. Driven by these aspects, numerous studies have been done to investigate 
oxide glass anodes from different aspects, such as compositions 1,3,7, fabrication methods 9,10, 
as well as microstructures 1113.
