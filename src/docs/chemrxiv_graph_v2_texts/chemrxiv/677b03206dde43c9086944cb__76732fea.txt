eration PRMT5 inhibitors engage either the cosubstrate or pep
tidesubstrate pockets through mechanisms that are either 
competitive or uncompetitive with SAM. The adenosine ana
logs LLY283 and PF06939999 represent some of the first de
scribed SAMcompetitive inhibitors and display high potency 
and selectivity for PRMT5 over other PRMTs.1215 The peptide
substrate binding pocket is structurally diverse as PRMTs 
methylate a range of proteins, affording distinct opportunities 
for targeting PRMT5.
