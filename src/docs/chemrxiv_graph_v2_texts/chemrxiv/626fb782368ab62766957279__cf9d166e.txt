Description:
Butterflies employed synthetically as starting materials for constructing larger species.

Polymetallic complexes of FeIII ion have always played a prominent role in the development molecular 
magnetism. FeIII2 dimers,1 FeIII3 triangles2 and FeIII4 butterflies3 not only represented ideal systems 
for developing quantitative magnetostructural correlations, they were also employed synthetically as 
starting materials for constructing larger and more complex species.4 The latter often contain the 
same vertex, edge, facesharing structural units as the reactants, linked via organic and inorganic 
bridging ligands.
