Description:
A platinum catalyst used for borylation of sterically encumbered alkylbenzenes.

Text:
Con
sequently, transitionmetal catalyzed borylation of steri
cally hindered arenes such as mesitylene where all aro
matic CH bonds are ortho to alkyls have been limited.21 An 
exceptional example was reported by Chatani and cowork
ers 
utilizing 
an 
NHCligated 
platinum 
catalyst, 
(ICy)Pt(dvtms) (ICy  1,3dicyclohexylimidazol2ylidene, 
dvtms  divinyltetramethyldisiloxane) where sterically 
encumbered alkylbenzenes such as mesitylene could be 
borylated to give corresponding aryl boronic esters.21 
As an alternative to transition metalcatalyzed chemistry, 
electrophilic arene borylation using boronbased electro
philes follows the general trend of reactivity and selectivi
ty of SEAr mechanism and thus shows selectivity in elec
tronrich CH bonds (electronic control), often at the or
tho or parapositions of alkylbenzenes (Figure 1a).12 In 
general, classical boronbased electrophiles consist of a 
single boron moiety connected to auxiliary mono or poly
dentate ligands that control the electrophilicity of the bo
ron center.
