Description:
A component of the Martian atmosphere used in propellant production.

Text:
A 
16 
reasonable and planned step is ISRU in the case of propellant production on Mars from CO2 of the 
17 
Martian atmosphere and H2 from water electrolysis of water ice from the Martian surface 5. However, 
18 
some highperformance materials cannot be produced on site. In these cases, the shippedin resources 
19 
should be recyclable in order to cease the costly transport as efficient as possible 6, which makes the 
20 
choice of stable and unreactive Fluoropolymers reasonable. 21 
Reaction engineering is crucial in designing highly integrated and efficient processes for optimal 
22 
utilization of weight, resources and time. The unique challenges of extraterrestrial sites like Mars or 
23 
permanent space stations equally pose unique opportunities to reevaluate reaction engineering of already 
24 
well understood reactions.

Description:
Converted to methane in low-temperature polymeric reactors.

Text:
Thus, the implementation of polymeric reactors for applications 
32 
beyond earth comes with the challenge of suitable and robust catalysts. 33 
We have recently demonstrated the viability of a polymeric reactor 9 for use in the lowtemperature 
34 
conversion of CO2 to Methane, as well as identified RuTiO2 as the most active catalyst at mild process 
35 
conditions 10. In this study, we expand our previous work by using a RuTiO2 catalyst in both a PTFE 
36 
and PFA based reactor and measure the activity and temperature throughout a wide range of process
