Magnesium and its alloys are attractive and promising materials for the aerospace, 
56 
automotive, and medical industries due to their low density, excellent formability, nontoxicity, 
57 
and damping properties 14. However, unlike aluminum and titanium, Mg alloys are 
58 
characterized by a low corrosion resistance due to their high reactivity and the absence of a stable 
59 
passive oxide layer 58. At present, the main ways of tailoring mechanical and corrosion 
60 
properties of magnesium alloys are alloying, surface modification, as well as the use of corrosion 
61 
inhibitors 2,911. 62 
The main groups of Mg alloys used in industry are MgAlZn, MgCa, and MgREEs (rare
63 
earth elements) alloys 6,7,12. The AZseries MgAlZn alloys account for more than 90 of 
64 
currently used magnesium alloys 13.
