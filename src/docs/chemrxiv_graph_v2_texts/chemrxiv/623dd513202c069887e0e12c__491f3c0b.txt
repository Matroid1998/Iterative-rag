Description:
The tetrahedral molecule known as white phosphorous, labeled as 3D aromatic.

Numerous unconventional forms of aromaticity have been identified experimentally in the last 
decades; Mbius aromaticity in macrocycles and metallacycles,16 allmetal aromaticity in 
the solid state,7 aromaticity in electronically excited states,818 and several other forms.1924 
Threedimensional aromaticity (3Daromaticity) is an intriguing topic introduced by Aihara in 
1978 when he analyzed polyhedral boranes using a Hckeltype molecular orbital theoretical 
approach.25 Closoboranes, such as B12H122 first synthesized in the 1950s,26 are highly stable 
compounds and emblematic 3Daromatic compounds.2731 Today, 3Daromaticity is also found 
in metal clusters and some charged fullerenes,3234 where the aromaticity of the latter is also 
classified as spherical aromaticity that follows Hirschs 2(n1)2 rule.35 The tetrahedral P4 
molecule (white phosphorous) and Group 14 element E44 Zintl ions have been labelled as 3D
aromatic,36,37 and this also applies to the ZnI8 (ZnI8(HL)4(L)812, L  tetrazole dianion) metal 
cluster which additionally can be described as cubic aromatic since it exhibits an electron 
delocalization over the entire ZnI8 cube.38
