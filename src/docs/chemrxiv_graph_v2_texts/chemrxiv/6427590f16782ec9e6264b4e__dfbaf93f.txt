Description:
Forms a highly stable 1012 helix.

for example by the groups of Gellman,10,11 
Sharma,8c,8h,12 Gopi,8a,8b,13 Tomasini,14 and recently our 
own, where we described a highly stable 1012helix 
made from a ciscyclopentylgamino acid.15 dAmino 
acid heteromers on the other hand, also proposed by Hof
mann and coworkers,9 have received far less attention 
despite their broad predicted range of helices, with the 
only examples coming from the same report, and from 
GervayHague and coworkers.16 These hybrid systems 
are of particular interest, because an a,ddipeptide corre
sponds to an aamino acid trimer unit and has the poten
tial to replace this in peptides and proteins.
