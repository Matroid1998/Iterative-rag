Description:
Exists as cis and trans rotational isomers with a high barrier to interconversion in the gas phase.

Text:
In ambient conditions, both CH3ONO cis and trans 
rotational isomers can be spectroscopically observed and distinguished from one another using a 
variety of techniquesgas and liquid 1H NMR, UVVis absorption, as well as rotational and 
vibrational spectroscopymaking conformerspecific studies possible.3,17,20,23,27 
The barrier to cistrans interconversion in the gas phase is relatively high at 45 kJmol 
due to contribution of resonance structures with planar CONO atoms.5,33 The relative energies 
of the two stable conformers differ by 5 kJmol, with cisCH3ONO being the more stable of the 
two.1,3,17,20,23 Other RONO molecules can exhibit steric repulsions that result in larger differences 
between conformer energies and thus abundances.1113,24 In the case of CH3ONO, the cisCH3ONO 
conformer is stabilized via internal hydrogen bonding, orienting the NO portion of the CONO 
dihedral towards the methyl group, resulting in a smaller van der Waals diameter than trans
CH3ONO.3,17,20,23,24,34,36 
The determination of conformer abundance of CH3ONO becomes increasingly 
complicated when moving away from the gasphase into complex environments such as those 
found in matrixisolation spectroscopy.

Description:
A compound whose conformer abundance is affected by the bath gas and deposition angle.

Text:
We performed a study on the effects of a given bath gas and the angle of deposition on the 
conformer abundance of CH3ONO during deposition in a lowtemperature matrix using three 
different inert bath gases nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), and xenon (Xe). Our observations indicate a 
change in conformer abundance that occurs between the gas and matrix phases. Changes to 
deposition angle were additionally found to alter conformer abundances in a N2 bath gas, while 
conformer abundances in Ar showed no angular dependence. We investigate the competition 
between effects of surface morphology and energetic stabilization on the trapping of the two 
conformers by analyzing the angular dependence of the abundances and performing quantum 
chemistry calculations of the gasCH3ONO complexes.
