These were
obtained in the commercially available pharmaceutical grade. Commercial acetaminophen (1.00 g), ibuprofen (1.00 g), and naproxen (1.00 g) tablets were dissolved in dimethyl
formamide using a 25 mL volumetric flask, respectively. The same process was repeated with a 1.00g sample of
naproxenPEG conjugate that was dissolved in dimethyl formamide. A TLC chamber was prepared with 10 ethyl acetate
(vv) in hexanes with a paper towel blotter. This was allowed to equilibrate while the TLC plates were prepared. A sample
of each was taken with a capillary tube, and was spotted onto each of 3 silica TLC plates (silica gel 60 matrix, Millipore
Sigma). Two beakers with watch glass covers were prepared with 5 and 10 ethyl acetate in hexanes.
