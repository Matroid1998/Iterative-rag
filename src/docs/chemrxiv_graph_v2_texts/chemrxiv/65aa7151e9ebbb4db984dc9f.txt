Description:
Involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are used as triggers for controlled drug activation.

Text:
The strategy of linking signalresponsive prodrugs to a carrier material is a promising approach 
to improve the selectivity of chemotherapy drugs.13 Besides the improved water solubility, it 
enables controlled drug release profiles via temporal, or local activation.4 Prodrugs or caged 
drugs are chemically modified therapeutics that are inactive until their activation via stimulus
induced removal of the cage group.5 In cancer therapy models, a variety of stimuli have been 
used as triggers for controlled drug activation via chemical decaging, including pH6,7, 
glutathione (GSH)8,9, reactive oxygen species (ROS)10,11, hypoxia12 or enzymes1315, amongst 
others1618. A common feature found in many prodrug systems to obtain controlled response, is their 
dependency on linker units such as selfimmolative spacers4 or a metabolically cleavable 
connection.
