Description:
A planar intermediate involved in the enantiomerization of racemic secondary alcohols.

Text:
As representative examples of 
these approaches, Bckvall has shown that a Rubased catalyst 
can promote the enantiomerization of racemic secondary alcohols 
(Fig 1A) via a planar carbonyl intermediate, which is compatible 
with the subsequent enzymatic acylative KR.1q, 1s, 2 Alternatively 
treatment of racemic trisubstituted lactol with an isothiourea 
catalyst and anhydride leads to ester product in high yield and 
enantioselectivity with enantiomerization achieved via an achiral 
ringopened intermediate (Fig 1B).3 The widely recognized 
remaining challenge in this area that has not been realized to date 
is to extend the DKR approach to tetrasubstituted lactol 
substrates (where none of the substituents at the carbinol are H) 
(Fig 1C).
