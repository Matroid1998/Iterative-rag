In practice, there are multiple challenges to the costeffective production of H2 from MSW and 
other available carbonbased waste products. Fermentation typically requires costly pretreatment to 
purify the starting materials,7 while supercritical water gasification is energyintensive and generally 
focused on valorizing landfill leachate.8 Due to low reaction rates with solid materials, gasification into 
smallmolecule carbonaceous intermediates, known as syngas, can enable additional strategies including 
steam reformation followed by the watergas shift reaction. Steam reformation and the watergas shift 
reaction are typically coupled together in tandem, using catalysts and additional energy input to drive the
