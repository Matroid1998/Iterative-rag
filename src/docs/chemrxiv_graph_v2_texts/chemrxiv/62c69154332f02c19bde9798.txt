Description:
Important in determining the magnitude of polarisation and coercive field in MDABCO-based perovskites.

Text:
Factors thought to be 
important in driving spontaneous and switchable polarisation of 
MDABCObased perovskites are the quasispherical nature of 
the Asite cation,3 orientation of the MDABCO dipole moment 
along the pseudocubic 111 direction, strain coupling and 
dipolar interactions.4 Hydrogen bonding, whilst it does not drive 
FE behaviour, has been shown to be important in determining 
the magnitude of polarisation and coercive field.5 

Formation of new perovskites requires the assembly of the 
BX6 octahedra, which can empirically be predicted by theradius 
ratio or octahedral factor,  !
