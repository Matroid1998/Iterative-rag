Description:
Used to direct intramolecular Pd(0)catalyzed C(sp3)H arylation onto triflimideprotected Narylaminomethyl cyclopropanes.

Text:
Yu and coworkers have reported a series of Pd(II)
C(sp3)H functionalization reactions on cyclopropane derivatives 
directed by Narylcarboxamides,4a,b Ntriflamides,4c carboxylic ac
ids,4d and primary amines,4e many of which can be rendered enanti
oselective. Cramer and coworkers exploited oxidative addition to a 
pendant bromoarene motif to direct intramolecular Pd(0)catalyzed 
C(sp3)H arylation onto triflimideprotected Narylaminomethyl
cyclopropanes.5a This approach was also extended to a number of 
other tethering units to formulate an approach to the synthesis of bi
cyclic systems containing a substituted cyclopropane unit and, in 
many cases, could be carried out enantioselectively.5cd Liang and co
workers reported an Ircatalyzed C(sp3)H borylation directed by a 
carboxamide motif.6 
In contrast, the deployment of Pd(II)catalyzed C(sp3)H func
tionalization strategies on cyclobutane scaffolds is less common (Fig 
1B).
