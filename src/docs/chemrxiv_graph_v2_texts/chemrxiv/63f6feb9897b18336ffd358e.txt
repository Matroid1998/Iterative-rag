Description:
Inhibitors discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb that target the PDL1 dimer and have shown strong activity in binding assays (10 nM or lower).

Despite the promising clinical benefits of antibody drugs targeting PD1PDL1 
immune checkpoints in cancer treatment, there are still major limitations such as poor 
patient tolerance1519, significant adverse reactions, insufficient oral bioavailability, and 
low response rates in most solid tumors20. One major challenge in the development of 
small molecule inhibitors of PD1PDL1 is the lack of a deep cavity in the PD1PD
L1 interaction surface, leading to slow progress in this field (Table S1). However, recent 
research has reported several promising compounds, including biphenylmethyl phenyl 
ether inhibitors discovered by BristolMyers Squibb, which target the PDL1 dimer and 
have shown strong activity in binding assays (10 nM or lower) 911.
