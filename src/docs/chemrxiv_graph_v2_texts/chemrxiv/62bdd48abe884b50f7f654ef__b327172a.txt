Description:
An ionic liquid with a melting point lower than 100Â°C, known for enhanced electrochemical stability.

Owing
to the complexity of battery systems and because many ana
lytical methods are not applicable for (in situ) studies of elec
trochemical systems, there is a demand for studies on well
dened model systems in order to understand the interactions
and reactions at different interfaces. In recent years, the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as elec
trolytes has attracted increasing attention.24 Ionic liquids,
which are dened as salts with a melting point lower than
100C, offer a variety of advantages, including an en
hanced electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, there are
reports that ILs decompose at low electrode potentials.57
One of the most studied ILs is N,Nbutylmethylpyrrolidinum
bis(triuoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPTFSI).
