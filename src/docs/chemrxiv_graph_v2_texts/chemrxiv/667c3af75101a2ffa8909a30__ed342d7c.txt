Description:
An important probe molecule in infrared spectroscopy for describing local electrostatic and chemical environments.

Text:
CO is an important probe molecule in infrared spectroscopy1, which describes local electrostatic and 
chemical environments in heterogeneous catalysis and in electrochemical characterization2 of transition 
metal (TM) active sites (COstripping voltammetry). Moreover, CO is a key reactantproduct in CO2 
reduction to lowcarbon fuels and high value products such as alcohols, acids, and hydrocarbons and in 
carbon sequestration for reducing greenhouse gases.3, 4 However, our theoretical understanding of CO 
adsorbed on a TM surface is fragmented. This is largely because our main tool to model such systems
density functional theory (DFT) even with functionals tuned for catalysislacks sufficient fidelity to 
reliably describe either the total energy or spectral properties, as we show in some detail in this work.

Description:
Binds to the hollow site on transition metal surfaces.

Text:
As 
one example, many functionals strongly overbind CO at the hollow site on TM surfaces.5 Such uncertainty 
hampers the informative and predictive nature of theoretical studies on CO2 reduction. How CO initially 
binds to the substrate is an essential component in the initial step for processes such as CO2 splitting into 
CO and O. If already the site preference of the initial step of the reaction process cannot be resolved to 
the required accuracy, modeling the entire reaction process remains in doubt. That being said, even while 
we find DFT energies are not reliable, we will show that DFT predictions of the structure (bond lengths) 
are much less variable between functionals, and align much better with available experimental data.

Description:
Adsorbs on TM surfaces and is studied using DFT and QSGW calculations.

Text:
In a study of the FeMgO magnetic tunnel junction (a 
system with some similarities to the present work), it gave an excellent description of the transmission 
probability.9 For benchmarking adsorption of CO on TM surfaces, we take structures of the adsorbed 
molecule using DFT, and perform QSGW calculations on them. We compare to photoemission data for CO 
on Cu (111)1012 and Pt (111)13, 14. Pt (111) as they remain the best characterized experimental studies of CO 
preferentially adsorbing on an atomic site, whereas Cu (111) is an experimentally relevant catalyst for
