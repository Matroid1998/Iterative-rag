Description:
A toxic byproduct produced from halogenated polymers during low-oxygen pyrolysis.

Text:
Current solutions typically favor mechanical 
recycling, which inherently lowers the quality of any products, lowoxygen pyrolysis, which is 
more energy intensive, returns plastics to crude oil, naptha, or fuel, but is more energy intensive 
and produces toxic byproducts such as dioxin from halogenated polymers.13 In contrast, chemical 
recycling through depolymerization has the potential to be more tolerant of contamination and 
mixedwaste streamsavoiding the laborious presorting required for other recycling 
techniques.4,5 In contrast to mechanical recycling, chemical recycling to monomers may allow for 
regeneration of the respective parent material of the same quality.68 However, despite significant 
efforts, many processes face severe technical and economic hurdlesranging from materials and 
catalyst design to reaction optimization on mixed waste streamsand hence are only utilized on 
less than 5 of plastic waste.6 
Given these extensive experimental challenges in chemical recycling, the development of 
assistive computational and informatics toolkits will undoubtedly accelerate efforts to develop
