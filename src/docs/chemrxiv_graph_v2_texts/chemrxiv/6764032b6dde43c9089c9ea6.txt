Description:
The most common terminal electron acceptor used by all aerobic organisms.

These molecules include proteins 
(e.g., cytochromes, oxidoreductases) and small molecules (e.g., 
quinones, flavins, phenazines) and all have the ability to change 
oxidation states under biological conditions.2 Oxygen is the most 
common TEA and is used by all aerobic organisms; however, 
many microorganisms have evolved to utilize insoluble TEAs, 
such as metal oxides.3,4 Utilization of insoluble TEAs requires 
passing electrons through cellular membranes and is commonly 
referred to as extracellular electron transfer (EET).4,5 There are 
three main mechanisms to accomplish EET 1) direct contact of 
redox proteins located in the cell envelope with the TEA, 2) 
secretion of cytochrome containing nanowires or outer membrane 
vesicles, or 3) use of small molecule redox mediators, also known 
as extracellular electron shuttles.6 Of all the EET mechanisms, 
mediated EET is the least understood with little known about the 
physicochemical properties of the mediators that drive EET 
activity.
