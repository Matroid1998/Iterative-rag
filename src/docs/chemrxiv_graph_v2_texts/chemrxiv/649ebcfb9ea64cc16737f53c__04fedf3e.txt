Description:
A set of quinoline-containing compounds.

Given the importance of the charge transfer (CT) process in influencing key photophysical parameters 
developing structureactivity relationships (SARs) to describe CT formation will be of interest to a wide 
range of stakeholders. In medicinal chemistry the development of SARs is standard practice, but a 
similarly detailed understanding of the structural properties controlling charge transfer has yet to be 
fully developed. Since protonation and Nalkylation have a significant and predictable effect on CT 
states in quinolinecontaining compounds these provide a good starting point for exploring these vital 
fundamental processes and developing effective SARs. One prominent set of quinoline containing compounds are the cinchona alkaloids, in particular the 
historically important antimalarial quinine.
