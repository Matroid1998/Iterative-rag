Description:
Participates in a reversible reaction with amine to form imine-type bonds.

Text:
used boronic acid esters to trigger the release of biological epitopes either using a competitor, 
or by exploiting pHdepending binding affinities.21 
Iminetype DCvC (reversible reaction between an aldehyde and amine) has become 
increasingly popular for tuning the viscoelastic timescales of soft biomaterials.22 The inherent 
differences in molecular equilibrium and rate constants between different types of crosslinking 
bonds such as oxime, semicarbazone, or hydrazone allow the engineering of hydrogel properties 
(i.e. stiffness, stressrelaxation, (bio)printability).2224 Notably, the chemical design space of such 
dynamic polymeric hydrogels is limited to telechelic synthetic systems or pendentmainchain 
modifications of natural polymers.

Description:
Groups that can be chemically modified via oxidation in natural biopolymers.

Text:
While some examples of synthetic telechelic systems can be 
found,22,2527 there remain remarkably few examples of watersoluble, biocompatible, synthetic 
polymers with pendent aldehyde groups.28,29 On the other hand, the facile chemical modification 
of natural biopolymers with aldehydes via oxidation makes them popular candidates for 
DCvC.9,10,23,24,30,31 However, their inherent heterogeneity, dispersity, and propensity to tieup 
aldehydes as hemiacetals,32 ultimately lead to limited control over composition and batchto
batch variability. In contrast, synthetic polymers can circumvent some of these drawbacks due to 
their welldefined chemical composition, molecular weight, and structural simplicity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024n9p8hv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000252893491 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
