Description:
Used in the form of nanoparticles to interact with biomolecules and modulate biological activity.

Text:
For instance, 
we have successfully utilized ligand exchange to control the assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)7 
and to modulate the interaction of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with biomolecules and, in turn, their 
biological activity.810 The most commonly used method for synthesizing AuNPs is the citrate
