Description:
Emissions have rapidly increased due to anthropogenic activities.

Due to the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past century, a number of 
technologies have been developed to reduce CO2 emissions from point sources.13 The most 
mature technology is amine scrubbing, which employs amine molecules to capture CO2 at a 
high concentration.4 Limitations of this technology include low CO2 capacities, parasitic side
reactions and large regeneration energies.5,6 Amine scrubbing utilizes a temperatureswing 
process and requires high temperatures to release CO2 and regenerate the amines. Electrochemically driven carbon dioxide capture is emerging as an energyefficient alternative 
to thermally driven processes.7 Electrochemical systems can be operated under isothermal 
conditions, limiting energy loss via heat.
