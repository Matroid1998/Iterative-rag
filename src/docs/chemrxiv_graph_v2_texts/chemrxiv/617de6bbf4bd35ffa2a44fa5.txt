Description:
A molecule whose hydrophobic association is sensitive to the choice of force fields.

Text:
Recent simulation studies from Ganguly et al.32 have shown 
that hydrophobic association is very sensitive to the choice of the force fields of TMAO molecule. It 
was found by Tah and Mondal33 that the collapsed form of a hydrophobic polymer is destabilized in 
mixed ureaTMAO solution.
