KOH,2,3 which allows for operation at current densities 
exceeding 2000 mA cm2 at 1.9 V when combined with highly active electrodes.4 However, 
the stability of the most common PBI derivative, poly(2,2(mphenylene)5,5
bibenzimidazole) (mPBI), is limited due to gradual backbone degradation, which results in 
severe membrane degradation within months under simulated operating conditions5 and 
weeks during electrolysis tests.6 Recent studies and simulations on model systems have 
revealed that the chemical degradation occurs through nucleophilic attack at the C2 position of 
neutral benzimidazole units, leading to ring opening and subsequent amide hydrolysis.7,8 
Despite efforts to improve stability through mechanical reinforcement,9 blending with more 
chemically stable components,10 or lowering the KOH concentration,11 these approaches are 
not presenting a solution to the intrinsic stability limitations of mPBI.
