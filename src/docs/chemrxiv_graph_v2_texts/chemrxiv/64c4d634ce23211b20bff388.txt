Description:
A carbon species known for its great conductivity.

Last but not 
least, the bulky size of the machines makes it almost impossible to conduct onsite measurements 
in crude environments or probe insitu mechanical changes in small moving objects. To overcome the issues above, a variety of soft mechanical sensors (SMS) have been developed 
during the past decades, which can be directly set onto target samples for insite measurements. The majority of SMS output electrical signals, whose sensing unit is typically based on stretchable 
conductors, carbonfilled composites or conductive gels. Stretchable conductors consist of metal 
nanowire arrays embedded in elastomers. Upon stress, the connection between metal nanowires 
changes, which induces variations in the electrical resistance.35 Many carbon species, including 
carbon black, graphene and carbon nanotubes also possess great conductivity.
