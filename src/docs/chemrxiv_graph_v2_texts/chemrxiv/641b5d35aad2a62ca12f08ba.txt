Description:
A sulfonated fluoropolymer commonly used as the proton exchange membrane material in fuel cells.

Proton transport (PT) plays a vital role in many different fields, including biology,19 energy
storage,1015 catalysis,16,17 gas separation,18,19 and proton exchange membrane (PEM) hy
drogen fuel cells.2025 Fuel cells are of current interest because of their high energy conversion
efficiency, high energy density, and their potential to aid in decarbonizing the transportation
sector.26,27
Current PEM fuel cells most commonly employ Nafion,28 a sulfonated fluoropolymer, as
the PEM material. While this material is widely used and wellcharacterized, there are still
questions about the precise mechanism and limitations of PT in hydrated Nafion.

Description:
Not an intrinsic proton conduction material and must be hydrated, limiting its operating temperature to 80Â°C.

Because of
this, there have been many recent studies using molecular simulations aimed at elucidating
the atomistic details of the PT mechanism in Nafion and related materials under hydrated
conditions.2935
A problem with Nafion is that it is not an intrinsic proton conduction material and must
be hydrated. This limits the operating temperature to  80C and requires complex and
costly water management systems to maintain proper hydration without flooding.27,3638
Developing membranes that can operate at elevated temperatures and at low humidity or
under anhydrous conditions can enable increased kinetics, higher resistance to electrode
