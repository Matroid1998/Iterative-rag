Description:
Materials characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms to assess texture.

Text:
However, comfortability in science often comes at the expense of critical thinking. Nowadays, scores of scientific reports routinely report nitrogen physisorption data and the 
textural properties thereafter derived without an indepth analysis of the recorded data or 
criticism of the results obtained after applying the models for assessing texture. Furthermore, 
there is an unhealthy trend to omit the experimental details of the test, even though clear 
recommendations have been published in several books,11,2326 reviews,2730 IUPAC 
reports,7,31 and some in international standards.32 
In this contribution, a critical assessment of the nitrogen adsorptiondesorption 
isotherms of a series of materials based on amorphous silicaaluminas and of the data thereof 
derived to characterize their texture is done.

Amorphous materials used in hydroprocessing reactions.

Text:
Namely, a set of amorphous silicaaluminas were 
tested in nitrogen physisorption experiments before and after loading them with nickel and 
molybdenum oxide by wet impregnation.33,34 These materials are normally applied for 
hydroprocessing reactions.3537 The paper fulfills two purposes. First, providing practical 
guidance on how to qualitatively analyze the data measured during nitrogen physisorption
