Description:
A clinically-approved drug selective for T790M-containing EGFR, used in the treatment of T790M-positive NSCLC tumors.

Text:
Activating mutations within the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) kinase domain, most prevalently L858R and exon19del, are common causes of 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and often serve as predictive markers for the 
selection of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as effective targeted therapies.12 
Prolonged efficacy of firstgeneration TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib) is eventually made 
limited due to drug resistance as a result of patients acquiring a second T790M 
gatekeeper mutation.3 To produce a viable treatment option for T790Mpositive NSCLC 

tumors, drug development efforts have yielded the clinicallyapproved drug AZD9291 
(osimertinib), which is selective for T790Mcontaining EGFR and made potent by forming 
an irreversible covalent bond to C797.45 Despite promising indications, drug resistance 
to osimertinib is inevitable and caused in part by the acquisition of a third kinase domain 
mutation C797S that prevents formation of the potencyenabling covalent bond.
