Over the past years, transition metalcatalyzed enantioselective CH activation has emerged as a powerful and efficient 
tool for the construction of molecular chirality.1 Significant progresses have been achieved on asymmetric CH 
functionalization catalyzed by noble transition metals.2 From a practical and sustainable viewpoint, it would be highly 
appealing and desirable to explore the use of earthabundant 3d transition metals as inexpensive and biologically friendly 
alternatives with complementary or even better reactivity and enantiocontrol.3 As an earthabundant and inexpensive 
3d transition metal, copper, was one of the prime contenders for this consideration.4 More importantly, owning to the 
easily accessible oxidation states ranging from 0 to 3 through both radical pathway and twoelectron transfer,4 copper
complexes might offer unique reactivity that are unavailable for precious metals.58 Significant advances have been 
achieved in Cucatalyzed enantioselective CH functionalization through outersphere mechanism, including 
asymmetric C(sp3)H insertion into copper carbenoid complexes with chiral Box ligand,5 atroposelective 
dimerization of electron rich arenes to construct axial chirality via SET mechanism,6 asymmetric KharaschSosnovsky
