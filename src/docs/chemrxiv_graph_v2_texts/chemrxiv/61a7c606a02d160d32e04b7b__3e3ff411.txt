Description:
A chemical group capable of engaging in redox processes or resonant energy transfers.

Various amino acid side chains on BSA surface are expected to display distinct 
reactivity towards the Au(III) substrate and the AuNC product.2024 Furthermore, the presence 
of certain chemical groups (some of which may form only as byproducts of the synthesis and 
are thus absent in the native albumin e.g. dityrosine25) capable of engaging in redox processes 
or resonant energy transfers in the clusters vicinity may be crucial for maintaining 
luminescence of BSAAuNC. The impact of charge transfer from surface ligands on
