Description:
Used in perovskite derivatives with high carrier mobility, low trap density, and long diffusion length.

While effective alternatives for PV applications rely most on tinbased compositions, several 
other phases containing different metals such as Bi, Sb, Cu, Ge, have been discovered and 
investigated.1219 In many cases, such perovskites resulted to be not suitable for PV devices but 
possess very appealing optoelectronic properties which can be exploited in other applications. Among these systems, bismuth and antimonybased perovskite derivatives of general formula 
Cs3M2X9 (MBi, Sb; XBr, I) have shown a strong technological potential in particular in the 
area of photocatalysis (both for solar fuel generation and organic synthesis) and 
photodetection.2036 
Bismuthbased defectordered perovskites have been object of more intense studies with 
respect to the corresponding Sb systems, notwithstanding their appealing optoelectronic 
properties such as high carrier mobility, low trap density, and long diffusion length.
