Description:
Participates in a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism with H2Q.

Text:
Based 
on the CV of O2O2, we clarified the PCET mechanism between 
electrogenerated O2 and H2Q forming H2O2 and quinone radical 
anion (Q) (Equation (2)), and the electronic inductive and 
resonance effects of substituents on PCET that control and 
improve its efficiency.14
