Description:
Particles used in detection systems for biological samples such as yeast cells and red blood cells.

One 
example uses an applied electric field of 60 V to drive the sample flow for the detection 
of bacteria.32 Similar designs have coupled syringe pumps with lower voltages for the 
detection of yeast cells,28 polystyrene particles21,33, DNA33, red blood cells25 and 
algae.34 Another advantage of controlling convection and the design of the sensing 
zone is the ability to force the analyte through a series of RPS sensing regions. Zhang 
et al.25 presented such a device where five identical sensing regions were arranged in 
series. As the analyte travelled through the device it generated five pulses, allowing 
each analyte to be measured multiple times, whilst providing a regular signal pattern 
to be identified against random background fluctuations.
