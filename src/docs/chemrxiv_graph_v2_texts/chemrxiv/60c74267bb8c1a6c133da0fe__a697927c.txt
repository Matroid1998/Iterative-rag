Description:
Can be deposited as conformal films in a hydrogen ambient at high temperature and pressure.

This was unexpected as 
the hydrogen ambient opens more pathways for the 
decomposition of TMB.8 In addition, we noted that attempts 
to deposit thicker films by increasing the deposition time 
failed, where three times longer deposition resulted in 
similar film thickness. In this work, we show that the deposition chemistry of 
TMB provides an inherent surface inhibiting effect for CVD 
of BxC films at 700 C and 5000 Pa, i.e. much higher 
temperature and pressure than employed in previous 
inhibited CVD studies, when performed in a hydrogen 
ambient and that this phenomenon can be used to deposit 
conformal boroncarbon films.
