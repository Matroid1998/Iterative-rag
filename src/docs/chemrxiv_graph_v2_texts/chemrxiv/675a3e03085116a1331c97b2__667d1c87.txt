Nanoclusters whose stability and catalytic performance are influenced by the choice and nature of ligands.

In the context of Au25 NCs, the choice and nature of ligands are critical factors that 
significantly influence their stability and catalytic performance. Ligands act as the outer 
protective layers, not only preventing aggregation and stabilizing the nanocluster, but 
also modulating its electronic properties and surface chemistry.6d, 9 The thiolbased 
ligands, in particular, are widely used due to their strong Smetal bonds, which provide 
high stability and a straightforward preparation strategy.10 However, beyond the 
stabilization effect, the intrinsic properties of the ligandssuch as their hydrophilicity 
or hydrophobicitycan profoundly affect the nanoclusters interaction with reactants 
and its overall electrocatalytic activity.11 For instance, Kwak et al.6c investigated the
