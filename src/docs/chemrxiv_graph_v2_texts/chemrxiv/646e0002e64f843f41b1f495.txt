of bromine atoms into reactive sites is more effective for kinetic stabilization of 
radical cation species despite its electronwithdrawing properties (E12V vs SCE 1.39 for 1, 1.45 for 
2, and 1.51 for 3). 5 

Figure 3. (a) Cyclic voltammograms of 13 (1.0 mM) at 297 K in CH2Cl2 containing 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 as a 
supporting electrolyte (scan rate 0.1 V s1, Pt electrodes). (b) Redox interconversion between 3 and 
3SbCl6. (c) Xray structure of 3SbCl6. Thermal ellipsoids are shown at the 50 probability level. With both neutral and radical cation species of 3 in hand, we next measured absorption spectra in 
CH2Cl2.
