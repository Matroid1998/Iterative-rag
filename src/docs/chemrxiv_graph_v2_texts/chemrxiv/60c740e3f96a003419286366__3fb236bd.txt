Description:
Changes coordination environment to fivefold or sixfold when bonded with water.

The adsorption of water in aluminophosphate zeotypes (AlPOs) is of particular interest due to
their potential application in adsorptionbased heat transformations using water as a working uid
13. Moreover, it is also interesting on a more fundamental level, as previous work has shown that
two types of adsorbed water molecules can be distinguished in hydrated AlPOs, namely (1) water
molecules that are bonded to framework Al atoms, leading to a change in the coordination environment
of aluminium to vefold (trigonalbipyramidal) or sixfold (octahedral) coordination, and (2) water
molecules that reside in the pores, which interact with oxygen atoms of the pore wall or of other water
molecules through hydrogen bonds.
