Description:
The dominant photoswitch class used in photoresponsive materials and photopharmacology.

Text:
Typically, a small 
molecule photoswitch is extended from or incorporated into a drug 
pharmacophore, such that light can spatiotemporally pattern its 
bioactivity by photoisomerising it.2 Azobenzenes are the dominant 
photoswitch class, and besides their many uses in photoresponsive 
materials, they are driving the frontiers of photopharmacology from 
cellular applications in neuroscience, cytoskeleton, and signaling, to 
therapeutic clinical trials in vivo.37 Nevertheless, two major limits on 
the performance of azobenzene tools remain (1) populationlevel 
photoswitching is not binary (allEallZ) but is incomplete, 
especially in the ZE direction (that also is less photonefficient); 
(2) no broadly applicable strategy to operate azobenzenes with well
penetrating redNIR light is known (typically, () are significant 
only below 530 nm).

Description:
Electron-rich azobenzenes can undergo photooxidation to form radical cations, while electron-poor azobenzenes can undergo photoreduction to form radical anions.

Text:
Hecht showed excellent 
azobenzene ZE isomerisation using triplet photoredox catalysts, 
via transient photooxidation to the radical cation11 (electronrich 
azobenzenes; e.g. AOMB, Fig 1ab) or photoreduction to the 
radical anion12,13 (if electronpoor). This arises as the radicals 
isomerise to their thermodynamically preferred E isomer ca. 1013 
times faster than do the neutral forms, so a 100E population 
accumulates after backelectron transfer. However, these systems 
are not applicable to biology. Among the many challenges, (i) with 
one exception,13 they are intermolecular concepts, so are unlikely to 
work at M levels needed for biocompatible reagents; (ii) as triplet 
systems, they require O2 exclusion to work efficiently, and with O2 
they also produce reactive species that photobleach the catalyst and 
are too toxic for use in biology (discussed in Supporting Note 1).
