Description:
A molecule used in the determination of cetane number (CN) for biofuel applications.

We find that these characteristics enhance the 
predictive ability of machine learning methods to predict molecular properties. The MACAW 
generative approach, based on these embeddings, can provide molecules with prespecified 
properties without the need for the expertise and time needed to train neural networks. The application of MACAW is demonstrated for property prediction, virtual screening, and 
inverse molecular design. MACAW embeddings are used for the prediction of complex 
properties, including research octane number (RON), cetane number (CN), melting point (MP) 
and flash point (FP) of molecules, as well as the binding of small molecules to the histamine 
H1 receptor and the muscarinic M2 receptor. These properties are demonstrative of both 
biofuel and medicinal applications.
