Description:
Obtained through a bottom-up approach by increasing the pH of a vanadium precursor solution.

In contrast, Group 
V POMs show a different assembly process. On the one hand, a bottomup approach is also followed to obtain polyoxovanadates. For instance, increasing the pH of a solution of the vanadium precursor yields larger structures, such as the decavanadate (V10O286
; V10, Figure 1). On the other hand, polyoxoniobates and tantalates have a top bottom route because of the lack of a stable 
monomeric precursor.
