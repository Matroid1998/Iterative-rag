Description:
A moiety in trimetallic metal compounds attributed with antibacterial properties.

Text:
were the first to highlight that the antibacterial properties of a 
trimetallic metal compound could be attributed to the presence of a rhenium tricarbonyl 
moiety in the structure.13 Mode of action studies attributed the activity of this compound 
to its detrimental effect on the bacterial cell membrane, causing depolarization but not 
pore formation. However, due to unfavorable solubility and cytotoxicity properties, the 
compounds were not evaluated further. More recently, several groups have 
investigated metal complexes based on the Re(CO)3scaffold. Frei et al. reported on 
dualmode of action bisquinoline rhenium tricarbonyl complexes which exhibited both 
light dependent and independent antibacterial activity against drugresistant Gram
positive and Gramnegative bacteria.14 The group of Zobi have shown that fac
Re(CO)3 diimine compounds show activity against Grampositive bacteria, including 
drugresistant ones.

Description:
Synthesized and studied with the antifungal drug clotrimazole as an axial ligand.

Text:
The complexes were shown to be effective in a zebrafish infection 
model.15,16 
Manganese, the firstrow transition metal congener of rhenium, has also been 
explored by several groups for its antibacterial properties. Due to the higher lability of 
the carbonyl ligands, manganese tricarbonyl complexes have been studied 
extensively as COreleasing molecules (CORM). Mendes et al. have synthesised and 
studied a series of manganese and rhenium tricarbonyl compounds bearing the 
antifungal drug clotrimazole as an axial ligand.
