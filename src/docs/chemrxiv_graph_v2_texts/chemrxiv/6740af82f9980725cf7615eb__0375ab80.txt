Description:
A gallium precursor with very high vapor pressure, challenging to use in ALD.

Text:
The reactor is then 
purged before introducing the subsequent precursor onto the substrate to deposit a layer of a 
second type of atoms4. The most common gallium precursors are the trialkyl metal molecules, 
trimethylgallium (TMG), and triethylgallium (TEG)5,6, and Ammonia (NH3), with or without 
plasma activation, or nitrogen plasma, are common nitrogen precursors. It has been shown that 
GaN deposited using TMG exhibits better optical and structural properties than GaN deposited 
using TEG.7 The very high vapor pressure of TMG makes it challenging to use in ALD, where 
the precursor vapor is typically drawn by low pressure in the reactor.8 Therefore, the use of 
TMG requires either valves that can open for a very short time or cooling of the TMG container.
