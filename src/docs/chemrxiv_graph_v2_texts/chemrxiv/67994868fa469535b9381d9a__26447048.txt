Description:
Nickel catalysts facilitate more facile activation of arylchlorides.

Text:
Molecular nickel catalysts are also less 
susceptible to nucleation due to the distinct differences in redox properties between nickel and palladium.12
13 These redox property differences also allow molecular nickel complexes to access a variety of oxidation 
states and oneelectron reactivity, which is rarer for palladium catalysts. Molecular nickel catalysts can thus 
access different reactivity compared to palladium catalysts such as more facile activation of arylchlorides 
and phenol derivatives,1415 and incorporation into photoredox catalysis cycles.1618
