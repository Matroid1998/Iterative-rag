Description:
A cofactor for nonheme iron enzymes that catalyze CH activation reactions.

Text:
. Metalloenzymes catalyze difficult reactions with exquisite selectivity that make their study 
of interest both for understanding their biological function and for synthetic catalyst design. Exemplary of this are the aketoglutarate (aKG)dependent nonheme iron enzymes13, which 
carry out CH activation reactions selectively. CH activation is difficult to achieve 
synthetically4,5 owing to the high CH bond dissociation energy and its inertness due to low 
polarity6. These nonheme iron enzymes are studied widely7 and are known to catalyze a variety 
of reactions such as CH hydroxylation,812 halogenation,1317 epoxidation,1821 desaturation,22 and 
ring cleavage23,24. These reactions play important roles in several biosynthetic processes2528 such 
as primary and secondary metabolism in plants29, generation of clinically relevant natural 
products3033, DNA repair3438 and transcription.3941 
Nonheme iron enzymes are also highly selective in nature.
