Description:
A compound synthesized using modern computer-assisted synthetic planning.

of the nitrogen atom. As already mentioned, all of 
these proposed routes avoid expensive catalysts and commence from inexpensive starting 
materials, readily available in large quantities (e.g., ethylamine at 0.018 g, 2bromoethyl acetate 
at 0.22 g, 5chloro2pentanone at 0.08 g, or ethanolamine at 0.012 g). Only few of these 
substrates were used in the previously publishedpatented syntheses. In Figure 3, their prices are 
indicated in red font. 10 

Figure 3. Novel syntheses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) designed automatically by Chematica. Substrates and their prices (the lowest ones we were able to identify) scaled to g are colored in 
red. In summary, we capitalized on the speed and chemical accuracy of modern computer
assisted synthetic planning to develop alternative and economical contingency plans for the 
synthesis of HCQ.
