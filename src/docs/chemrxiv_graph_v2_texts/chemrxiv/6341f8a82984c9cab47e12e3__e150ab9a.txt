Description:
Products obtained from the selective reduction of carboxylic acids using a thioester intermediate.

Text:
The most relevant prior art to this study involves the timehonored 
Fukuyama reduction, commonly viewed as a robust method for reducing carboxylic acids selectively to aldehydes 
that proceeds via a thioester intermediate employing a Pd catalyst and Et3SiH as a mild reductant.10 Advances of 
late using Earthabundant nickel have emerged as alternative catalytic approaches.1113 For example, Iosub, 
Bergman, and coworkers have recently developed a Ni (10 mol )catalyzed process using a mixed anhydride as 
an intermediate and Ph2SiH2 as reductant14 in dilute EtOAc at 40 C, over 24 hours, for converting (mainly) aliphatic 
carboxylic acids to aldehydes.
