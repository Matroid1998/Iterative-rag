Description:
A component involved in desalination processes, particularly in removal efficiency.

Text:
We 
noticed that PEI activation (acid and base treatment) was crucial to optimizing the desalination 
in terms of chloride removal (Scheme S1B). The residual PEIs were filtered and recycled using 
acidbase reactions (Scheme S1C). Considering that the ratelimiting process of our desalination is CO2 absorption in brine 
solutions, the PEIs performance in desalination should be investigated beyond chloride 
removal efficiency and recyclability, as provided in our previous work.7 We postulated that the 
chemical structures, morphologies, and integrity of alkylated PEI (before and after acid 
treatment), CO2 exposure, and subsequent chloride extraction would be crucial to improving 
the performance of hydrophobic PEIs.
