Description:
A commercially available starting material used in the preparation of bench-stable complexes.

Furthermore, the 
importance of ESASH to prepare biologically active com
pounds1720 using first row metals2127 holds promise for an 
applicationsbased outcome as a longer term goal in sustaina
ble metal catalysis.28 Benchstable complexes such as 1 can be 
prepared in a single step from commercially available starting 
materials, namely HPR2 and Mn2(CO)10 (Scheme 1 and TOC 
graphic). This allows simple gramscale access to potentially 
exciting catalyst diversity.29 Together, these attributes moti
vated us to explore dinuclear Mn2H systems for catalytic ap
plications and uncover novel reactivity and coordination 
chemistry. Scheme 1. Synthesis of Dinuclear ESASH Catalysts
