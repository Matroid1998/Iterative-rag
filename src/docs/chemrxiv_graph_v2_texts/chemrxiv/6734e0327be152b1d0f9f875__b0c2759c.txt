Description:
Involved in reactions such as atom loss or dissociation from perfluoroalkyl radicals.

Text:
An example is the variational transitionstate theory treatment of reactions like fluorine
atom loss or singletCF2 dissociation from nperfluoroalkyl radicals or the dissociation of
the carbonsulfur bond in perfluorinated sulfonic acids, using bondstretching coordinates
and singlereference density functional methods by Altarawneh and coworkers.7,8 While
these reactions may be relevant to PFAS thermal decomposition, the series of carboncarbon
bond scissions (and their reverse associations) within perfluoroalkyl chains indicated to be
important by bond dissociation energies have not been studied thoroughly. Wardlaw and
coworkers have carried out a theoretical study of 2 CF3 
C2F6 using canonical flexible
transition state theory,11 but more refined theoretical studies of this reaction and studies of
the size dependence of perfluoroalkyl radical combinations have not been published to our
knowledge.
