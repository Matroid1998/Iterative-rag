Description:
Binds molecular oxygen and facilitates four-electron reduction of oxygen to water during respiration.

Metals catalyze numerous biological processes and serve as cofactors for several key enzymes.13 In 
fact, it has been estimated that nearly half of all enzymes utilize metals to enable their structural 
integrity and functional role.47 For instance, the hemecopper complex in cytochrome c oxidase binds 
molecular oxygen and facilitates fourelectron reduction of oxygen to water during respiration812 (Figure 
1A top panel) and the hemeiron cofactor in myoglobinhemoglobin proteins enables transfer and 
storage of oxygen (Figure 1A bottom panel).1315 Similarly, plants use calcium and manganese cofactors 
to catalyze the oxidation of water during photosynthesis (Figure 1B top panel)16,17 while symbiotic 
nitrogenfixing bacteria in legumes use iron and molybdenum cofactors to catalyze nitrogen conversion 
to ammonia (Figure 1B bottom panel).18
