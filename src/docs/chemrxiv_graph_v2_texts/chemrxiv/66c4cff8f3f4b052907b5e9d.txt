Description:
A high-value product derived from methane conversion processes.

Text:
Methane reserves are abundant on Earth and there are substantial economic and envi
ronmental benefits for converting methane to complex molecules instead of burning it as
fuel. From the environmental perspective, using methane as fuel is not ideal because of the
undesirable release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In economics terms, products of
methane conversion are more valuable than inert methane because they can be used in a
variety of downstream chemical manufacturing processes. These considerations have driven
extensive efforts to develop methane conversion reactions 17. Presently, the commercial processes of methane conversion, such as steam reforming or
partial oxidation, are multistep indirect procedures that produce synthesis gas that is then
converted into highvalue products, such as methanol, olefins, and parafins 3, 5.
