Description:
A conductive support material with high conductivity but prone to high antimony dissolution.

However, the low dissolution 
stability of the alloying elements is a concern considering both catalyst durability and membrane poisoning.17 Using support materials for 
iridium catalysts instead can introduce a high dispersion of the iridium phase, thus increasing the amount of reaction sites. However, the 
electrical connection of the iridium sites must be ensured to render them active for the OER. To achieve this, several conductive supports 
have been tested, for example antimonydoped tin oxide (ATO)18 and tantalumdoped TiO219 showing high conductivity. But once more, the 
dissolution stability of these materials is questionable; illustratively, a high antimony dissolution from ATO has been shown in threeelectrode 
electrochemical tests.20 
To avoid support degradation, TiO2 is established as a stable support, both in academic research13,2125 and industry.
