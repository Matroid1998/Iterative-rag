Description:
Catalytic process driven by hydroxyl radicals.

Text:
A crucial feature of this system is the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals, released from
TiOH, TiOH, and TiOH bonds. With a redox potential of 2.8 V (second only to fluorine),
hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive, yet transient species that drive the organotitanium catalytic
process. While TiO photocatalysis is known to produce hydroxyl radicals, their synergistic role in
facilitating complex reaction cascades in this system is unprecedented. Although hydroxyl radicals typically exist on the nanosecond scale, they can persist for up to 600
seconds in aqueous environments, enabling diverse redox reactions. These include dimerization to
form HO, oxidation of TiO bonds to peroxotitanium species (TiOO), oxidation of PI ligands to
NO functionalities, conversion of CO to HCOOH, and condensation or radical coupling involving
formaldehydederived intermediates.
