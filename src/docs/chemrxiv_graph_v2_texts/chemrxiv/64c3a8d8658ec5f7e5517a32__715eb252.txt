A versatile and inexpensive photocatalyst used in photochemical reactions.

Text:
Photochemical reactions mediated by tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT), a versatile and 
inexpensive photocatalyst, have been extensively studied over the past decade.14 The mainstream use 
of the decatungstate photocatalysis relies on its property to easily abstract Hatoms (hydrogen atom 
transfer, HAT) from CH bonds with bond dissociation energies of up to 100 kcal mol1 upon 
photoexcitation with UV light (310400 nm, Scheme 1, a).5 This keynote property has resulted in the 
emergence of several facile CH activation methodologies, such as the works of Fagnoni,611 
MacMillan,12,13 Nol,6,7,14 and Melchiorre groups,15 to name a few.
