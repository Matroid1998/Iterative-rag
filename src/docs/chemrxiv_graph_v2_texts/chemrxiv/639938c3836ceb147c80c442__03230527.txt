Description:
A redox-active species that shuttles electrons or holes between immobilized electrocatalysts and an electrode.

One approach to imparting conductivity 
is to tether redoxactive moieties, such as ferrocene (Fc), to 
MOF nodes, and then rely upon electron or hole exchange be
tween neighboring neutral and oxidized, or reduced and neutral 
forms of the tethered species.2327 This mechanism of charge 
propagation is often termed redox hopping and can be con
trasted with approaches that instead impart conductivity by in
troducing bandlike electronic properties.2830 It also can be con
trasted with approaches that rely upon permeation of MOF 
channels with a solution containing dissolved redoxactive spe
cies (for example, methylviologen dications (MV2)) that phys
ically shuttle electrons or holes between immobilized electro
catalysts and an underlying electrode.31 
Here we return to the notion of conduction via repetitive 
charge hopping between MOF tetheredimmobilized redox spe
cies.
