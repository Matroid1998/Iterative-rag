Description:
A class of materials consisting of ns2 lone pair cations from group 14 and 15.

Initial solar cells containing these
materials have shown promise, achieving powerconversion efficiencies (PCE)  4.1114
In this work we focus on Sn2SbS2I3, a promising mixedmetal chalcohalide from the
AII
2BIIICh2X3 class of materials consisting of ns2 lone pair cations from group 14 (A  Sn,
Pb) and 15 (B  Sb, Bi). The first device was fabricated by Nie et al. 11 and obtained a
PCE of 4.04 using a single step, solutionbased chemical deposition process. Although this
