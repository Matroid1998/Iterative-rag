Description:
A hydrogen-rich molecule used as an energy carrier with distinct advantages over other carriers.

Text:
While direct electrification of certain end uses is poised to grow
rapidly (e.g. lightduty vehicles), it may be challenging in particular applications such as
heavyduty transport like shipping and aviation where high energy density requirements
remain a key performance criterion. For these end uses, using alternative energy carriers
like hydrogen (H2) and by extension hydrogenrich molecules like ammonia (NH3) and other
liquid fuels, produced using lowcarbon pathways, remain an appealing prospect. Ammonia offers some distinct advantages over other energy carriers, such as being carbon
