Description:
Possess too low triplet energies for injection into common semiconductors.

8 Acene derivatives are the most studied SF ma
terials, and while their analysis has pushed the mechanis
tic understanding of SF, 9 they do not constitute desirable
materials for photovoltaic applications as they possess ei
ther too low triplet energies for injection into common semi
conductors (pentacenes) or slightly endothermic ES12T1
(tetracenes and anthracenes). 8,10 Therefore, expanding the
pool of SF materials is essential for realizing its potential in
solar cell applications. Previous attempts at discovering molecules suitable for
SF focused on modifications of known systems, such as
tuning their diradical character, adjusting conjugation,
or modifying heteroatom oxidation.
