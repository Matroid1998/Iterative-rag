Description:
A cost-competitive absorber in photovoltaics.

Text:
Research and development in photovoltaics (PV) has seen remarkable advancements over the 
last few decades. Highefficiency and costcompetitive absorbers such as lead halide 
perovskites (LHPs), silver bismuth sulfide, and antimony chalcogenides have emerged among 
some of the most promising.1 In particular, LHPs have demonstrated exceptional PV 
performance mainly due to long chargecarrier diffusion lengths, strong light absorption, low 
nonradiative recombination rates, defect tolerance, and highquality thinfilm morphologies.2 
While efforts to improve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been extensive over the 
years, operational stabilitya crucial parameter for assessing the realworld performance of 
any PV technologyremains the most significant bottleneck for many emerging and early
stage PV technologies.
