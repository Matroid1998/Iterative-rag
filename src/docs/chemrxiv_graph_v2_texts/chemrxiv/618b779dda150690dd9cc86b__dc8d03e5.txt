As a result, Dy complexes have been developed as 
highperformance molecular magnets.1ah Recently, organometallic Dy complexes that have a 
strong magnetic anisotropy or high symmetry around the Dy ion with a large E have been 
reported. In this system, a (weak) CF is a dominant source of the perturbation to resolve the 
degeneration of ground multiplet (6H152) so that the axial magnetic states are stabilized.1ac, 4, 5 
Therefore, an electrostatic CF has been used to control the physical properties of the felectrons. In addition, significant efforts have been made to enhance the features by changing the CF, 
magnetic interactions, and ligands.
