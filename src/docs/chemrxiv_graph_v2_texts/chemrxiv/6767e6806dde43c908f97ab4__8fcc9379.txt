Description:
A phosphoinositide involved in the translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane.

Text:
FGF2 secretion follows a unique mechanism involving
direct translocation across the plasma membrane. Initially, soluble FGF2 monomers interact directly with the inner
leaflet of the plasma membrane via binding to the Na, KATPase. Subsequently, FGF2 is transferred to PI(4,5)P2
