Description:
A D6h symmetric sheet used to restructure the connectivity of nitrogen-containing rings.

Text:
a seven
membered ring, to ensure that the remainder of the graphene
plane remains structurally sensible, important variables in
constructing active site models are the type and number of
defects. Three representative active site models are shown
in Figure 1. In models 1 and 2, the D4h symmetry is kept in
the first coordination sphere of the pyrrolic FeN4 centre akin
to a porphyrin complex, but with sevenmembered rings at
different positions. In model 3, the local symmetry of the FeN4
centre is reduced to D2h resembling a porphycene complex
and the connectivity of the four nitrogencontaining rings is
restructured to fit into the D6h symmetric graphene sheet. Open questions to be addressed in this work are to what
