Description:
Colloidal microspheres suspended in the aqueous phase.

Text:
The aqueous phase contains also suspended 
colloidal silica (SiO2) microspheres. We show that when we confine this liquid dispersion 
between two parallel plates, the colloidal particles migrate to the oilwater interface and get
