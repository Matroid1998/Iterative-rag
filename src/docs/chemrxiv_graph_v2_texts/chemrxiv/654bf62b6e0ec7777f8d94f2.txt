Anthropogenic emissions have left an enduring effect on the Earth's environment and climate.

The anthropogenic emissions of CO2 since the industrial revolution, in part by numerous industrial 
chemical processes that rely on reagents produced from fossil fuels, has already left an enduring 
effect on the Earths environment and climate. (1) Defossilization of our economy can be supported 
through the electrification of industrial synthetic processes by coupling electrosynthesis with 
renewable energy sources. (26) For example, electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of organic 
substrates has emerged as a promising strategy to synthesize organics and valorize biomass 
derivatives to produce valuable fine chemicals, natural products, and medicines. (711) 
Furthermore, if driven by renewable electricity under mild conditions, ECH could supersede 
traditional thermal hydrogenation processes, which typically demand highly pure H2 produced 
from steam reforming, as well as high pressures and elevated temperatures.
