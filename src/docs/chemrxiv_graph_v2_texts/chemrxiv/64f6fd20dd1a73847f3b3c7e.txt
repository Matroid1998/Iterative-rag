Description:
An archetypal ferroelectric nematogen.

Text:
Molecular organization in the apolar nematic (a) and ferroelectric nematic (b) 
phases; arrows represent molecular electric dipole moments and are coloured 
according to the polar order parameter P1 which takes a value of 0.06 in (a) and 
0.89 in (b), while P2 is  0.65 in both cases. (c) The molecular structures and 
transition temperatures (C) of the three of the archetypal ferroelectric nematogens 
RM734 1, DIO 2, and UUQU4N 16.
