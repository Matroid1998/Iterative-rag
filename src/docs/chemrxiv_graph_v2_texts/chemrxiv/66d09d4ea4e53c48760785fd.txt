Description:
Release is a primary driver for safety hazards such as thermal runaway.

Text:
As the nickel content in the active material
increases, so does the capacity, but this also makes the material significantly more prone
to aging.3 Common aging mechanisms for Nirich cathode active materials (CAM) include
gassing and cracking, both of which heavily impact battery safety and capacity.4,5 Among
these, oxygen release is particularly concerning as it is the primary driver for safety haz
ards such as thermal runaway.6 Oxygen release typically occurs at high voltages, which are
applied at the end of charge.7 The interface between different phases in cathode materials
also plays a critical role in determining their performance and longevity.

Description:
Released during undesirable side reactions at the cathode interface, contributing to material degradation.

Text:
Nirich materials,
in particular, suffer from the formation of secondary phases such as spinel and rock salt
at the interface between cathode and electrolyte.8 These phases can disrupt the materials
structure and degrade its electrochemical performance. Moreover, the presence of Ni4 at
the interface is problematic as it can act as a catalytic site for undesirable side reactions,
leading to increased oxygen release and degradation.9 Mitigating oxygen release is a key
focus in cathode design, with doping and coating being typical countermeasures.1013
Both can stabilize the interface by altering the local electronic structure and reducing the
formation of Ni4 ions.
