Description:
Synthetic plastics that can be depolymerized by plastic-degrading hydrolases.

Text:
Among millions of tons of synthetic plastics generated annually (constituting 30 
polyesters3), a mere 12 is recycled worldwide.1,46 The microand nanoplastics accumulated 
in soil and marine biomes are challenging to recycle7,8 due to their low concentrations and 
small sizes.911 Extracting value from waste plastics requires processes that yield products at 
low environmental and economic costs.12 
The discovery of plasticdegrading hydrolases opens a new avenue for polyester 
depolymerisation, by which the enzymatic process scan be performed at nearneutral pH (6
8), and moderate temperatures (2565C) with low operating costs.13,14 Active polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) hydrolases have been reported, such as IsPETase (obtained from I. 
sakaiensis)15, and its more robust variant DuraPETase (Dura) with a 300fold enhanced 
activity on PET degradation (crystallinity 30) compared to the original at 37 C.16 Enzymatic 
plastic degradation also demonstrated industrial feasibility with a variant of leafcompost 
cutinase (LCC) depolymerising postconsumer PET waste with low energy input.17 However, 
enzymatic depolymerisation has only been demonstrated as a preliminary step for virgingrade 
PET regeneration, in which the product range is limiting and of low value.
