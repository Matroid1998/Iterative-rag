Description:
A surface moiety present in the colloidal nanoparticles of K,NaPHI.

Text:
Recently, we reported the first synthesis of fully watersoluble ionic polymeric carbon nitride, i.e., 
potassium and sodium ioncontaining poly(heptazine imide) (K,NaPHI),34 an ionic member of the 
polymeric carbon nitride family.3541 In aqueous solutions, the K,NaPHI material can be fully dispersed 
in form of very small K,NaPHI colloidal nanoparticles (hydrodynamic diameter 10 nm ) containing a 
large number of cyanamide and cyamelurate surface moieties, resulting in highly stable quasi
homogeneous solutions of K,NaPHI with no gelation or precipitation over several months.34 Given the 
unique features of K,NaPHI (i.e., water solubility, chemical stability, and ionic nature), we
