Description:
A lower-cost, earth-abundant alternative to palladium catalysts.

Chemical reaction optimisation is a challenging and resourceintensive yet essential process in
chemistry. Chemists explore combinations of various reaction parameters (e.g., reagents, solvents,
catalysts) to simultaneously optimise multiple objectives such as yield and selectivity. In process
chemistry, reaction optimisation faces more rigorous demands on reaction objectives than in academic
settings, encompassing additional economic, environmental, health, and safety considerations 1, 2. These factors often necessitate the use of lowercost, earthabundant, and greener alternatives, such
as replacing traditional palladium catalysts with nickel 3, 4, and selecting solvents that adhere to
pharmaceutical guidelines 5. Optimal reaction conditions satisfying these stringent criteria are often
substratespecific and challenging to identify generally for a given set of reactants.
