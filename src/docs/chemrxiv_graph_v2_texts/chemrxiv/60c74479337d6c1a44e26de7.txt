Description:
A gas used in PHIP for chemical reactions to produce hyperpolarized products.

There 
are three significant drawbacks to this technique (1) it is 
prohibitively 
expensive, 
(2) 
complex 
cryogenic 
equipment is required to reach 1.4 K, and (3) the 
hyperpolarized material is delivered in batchmode, with 
tens of minutes of preparation time required between 
sample deliveries. PHIP (parahydrogen induced polarization) is an 
alternative hyperpolarization modality which involves 
chemical addition of hydrogen gas enriched in the para 
spin isomer to a substrate molecule 2,12. PHIP is 
approximately 12 orders of magnitude less expensive 
than dDNP, and can produce hyperpolarized products 
with a much higher duty cycle because it only requires 
chemical reaction with hydrogen gas.

Description:
Used in the paraenriched form for addition to unsaturated precursors in hyperpolarization processes.

Text:
However, the 
application of this powerful tool to in vivo metabolic 
studies is hampered by the limited number of metabolites 
that can be hyperpolarized by means of parahydrogen 
addition to an unsaturated precursor of the target 
molecule 1316. Hyperpolarized 113Cfumarate has 
Figure 1 Reaction scheme showing the chemical addition of 
paraenriched hydrogen to an unsaturated 113Cacetylene 
dicarboxylate precursor, to yield 113Cfumarate. The proton 
singlet order is then transformed into 13C magnetization by 
applying a constantadiabaticity magnetic field cycle 18, 
optimized for the 113Cfumarate Jcouplings. The field
cycling profile is shown in the inset.
