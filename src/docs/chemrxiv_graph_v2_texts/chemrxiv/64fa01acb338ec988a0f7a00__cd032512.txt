Furthermore, in 2019, a review discussed on the use of rare earth elements
with transition metalbased materials for ecatalysts design, synthesis, and applications were exhaustively
analyzed in Gaos research work 22. It shows that these rare earth metals could be used for materials
engineering for hightech applications as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), methanol oxidation reaction
(MOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Many benefits and challenges
of hybrid materials made via the use of rare earth elements are considered in the study. An alumina (Al2O3)
supported nickel catalysts (NiAl2O3) modified by rare earth elements was demonstrated as a highly active
catalyst for the decomposition of NH3 as described in Okuras paper 23.
