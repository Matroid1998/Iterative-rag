Description:
Have been the focus of many reports regarding their reactivity.

Text:
The reported procedures largely rely on the transitionmetalcatalyzed CN crosscoupling 
reactions3 and SNAr reactions of 1haloisoquinolines with amines.4 In the recent past, several 
groups have accomplished major advances in this field using CH functionalization reactions.5 
Despite showing great potential, these procedures often require multiple steps for the pre
functionalization of substrates, use of toxic reagents, precious metal catalysts and show region
selectivity issues. Therefore, the development of a costeconomical approach addressing the 
drawbacks of previous protocols is highly desirable. In the last few years, many reports have 
focused on the reactivity of carbonitriles.

The carbonitriles lack electrophilic properties and are 
generally activated by the transitionmetalacidbase catalysts towards nucleophilic additions 
and ensuing annulation.6 Many groups have utilized differently substituted nitrilecontaining 
functionalities for the synthesis of arylalkyl ketones, diketones, benzofurans, etc.7 In all such 
reactions the nitrogen atom was not found to be incorporated into the product due to the
