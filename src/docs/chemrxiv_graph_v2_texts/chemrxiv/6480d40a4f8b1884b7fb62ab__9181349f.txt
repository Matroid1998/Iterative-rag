Description:
Small adsorbate with simple monodentate binding motives on ideal metal surfaces.

The adsorption energies of key reactants are the most commonly used descrip
tors for the activity of heterogeneous catalysts, and thus play an important role
in understanding and designing catalysts.1, 2 In the case of small adsorbates
(e.g. OHx, CHx, NHx) and ideal metal surfaces, adsorption energies are rela
tively straightforward to calculate with rstprinciples methods. In this case,
the adsorbates feature simple monodentate binding motives and the number
of symmetry inequivalent surface sites on lowindex crystalline facets is small. Indeed, one can even benet from simple linear scaling relations to estimate
adsorption energies across dierent surfaces.3
The situation is dierent when larger reactants are involved in the process.
