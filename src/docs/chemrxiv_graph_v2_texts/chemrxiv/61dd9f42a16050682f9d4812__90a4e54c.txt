Description:
Coupled with carbon nitride to facilitate overall water splitting in Z-schemes.

Text:
In the last decade, organic materials have shown promise due to their tunability (e.g., in terms of light 
absorption), and their potential to be produced inexpensively on large scale.12,13 Although organic photo
catalysts were investigated widely after the first report of carbon nitride in 2009,16 most studies have 
been confined to sacrificial halfreactions that produce either hydrogen or oxygen, not both.1721 Few 
organic photocatalysts have been reported for overall water splitting. Carbon nitride materials have been 
coupled with metal oxides to facilitate overall water splitting in so called Zschemes, whereby hydrogen 
evolution occurs on the organic photocatalyst while oxygen evolution occurs on the metal oxide.
