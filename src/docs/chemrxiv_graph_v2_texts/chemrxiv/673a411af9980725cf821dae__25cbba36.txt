Sulfurcontaining polymers are employed in range of 
commercial applications from conjugated polymers to high 
refractive index materials.1 Since the first half of the 19th 
century, rubbers have been vulcanized with elemental 
sulfur to produce materials with controlled degrees of 
crosslinking and improved physical properties.2 More 
recently, in 1962, DuPont commercialized Nafion, a 
perfluorinated polymer with sulfonate groups, which allow 
the material to be used as a protonconducting membrane 
in fuel cells.3 Most sulfurcontaining polymers, such as the 
synthesis of polysulfones, are synthesized via stepgrowth 
condensation methods. However, incorporating sulfur
based functionalities into polymers via living chaingrowth 
methods is desirable to control polymer molecular weight, 
chainend identity, and dispersity.
