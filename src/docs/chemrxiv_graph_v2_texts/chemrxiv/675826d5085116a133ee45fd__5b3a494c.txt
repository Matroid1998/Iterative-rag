Description:
Enables electron transfer to O2 in metal ion-coupled electron transfer (MCET).

Text:
Thus, an 
electron transfer from donor (D) to O2, which is 
thermodynamically infeasible in the absence of 
metal ions, becomes possible in the presence of Mn. This process is generally called metal ioncoupled 
electron transfer (MCET).12,22,23 Scandium3 ion, 
with its smallest radius among M3, can bind strongly 
with O2, making it far more effective than other 
Mn ions for providing SET reactions driven by 
MnO2 complex formation12,2429 
A review of previous reports on the role of Sc(OTf)3 
in 
photoinduced 
electron 
transfer 
(PET) 
transformations involving the reductive activation of 
dioxygen confirms that a lightabsorbing electron 
donor and additional stabilisation are necessary.
