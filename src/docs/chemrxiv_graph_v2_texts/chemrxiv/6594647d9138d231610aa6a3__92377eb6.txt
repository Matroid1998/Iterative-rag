Description:
Metallolactamase inhibitors that are not antibacterial on their own.

Text:
In view of the above, and inasmuch as the indole carboxylate (InC) metallolactamase (MBL) inhibitors4 that 
were developed in Oxford are, in point of fact, not antibacterial in their own right, and must be coadministered 
with a lactam antibiotic e.g. penicillin, cephalosporin or carbapenem, it was of interest to partner the 
aforementioned InC with an antibacterial agent via a cleavable linker so as to generate novel associative 
heterodimers, which could be coadministered with a lactam antibiotic for an improved therapeutic effect. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023ff18gv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000159202286 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
