Description:
Produced from the conversion of polysiloxanes at high temperature using steam.

The chemical recycling of waste silicones has been widely 
studied for over 80 years.10 Initially, the decomposition of 
polysiloxanes was carried out at very high temperature (600C) 
under inert condition or in air (300C).14 On the one hand, the 
reaction at 600C gives a mixture of cyclosiloxanes (D3D8) 
favouring small cycles. On the other hand, CO2 and silica are 
observed as the major products for the thermal cracking in air 
at 300C. Besides, steam could be used as an agent for the 
conversion of the polysiloxanes at high temperature to 
(oligo)silanols.15 However, most of these methods require high 
temperature and give a moderate yield of a mixture of products 
such as cyclic siloxanes, but also silanols, silica, etc.
