Description:
Atoms that are protonated to balance the net negative charge in aluminosilicates.

Text:
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with microporous structures and are known to cat
alyze a number of commercially signicant transformation reactions.17 Aluminosilicates
contains Al atoms replacing some of the Si atoms of the SiO4 tetrahedra in zeolite frame
works, and the resulting net negative charge is balanced by protonation of O atoms. Such
protons on the framework form Brnsted acid sites (BAS or bridged SiO(H)Al site) that
trigger acidbase catalytic reactions and this plays a critical role in many of its applica
tions in catalysis. Connement eects of the zeolite might be also important for catalytic
reactions. A zeolite containing BAS is dened as an acidic zeolite.
