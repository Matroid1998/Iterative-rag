Description:
Molecular metal oxide clusters formed by self-assembly in solution.

One recent approach to modify BiVO4 photoelectrodes is 
incorporation of polyoxometalates (POMs) as singlesource 
molecular precursors. POMs are molecular metal oxide clus
ters formed by selfassembly in solution.1214 Of specific in
terest in this context is the cobaltfunctionalized polyoxomet
alate Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)210 (CoPOM), where a Co4O4 
core is stabilized by two oxidatively resistant polyoxotungstate 
ligands.1517 The compound has been reported as an active 
water oxidation catalyst (WOC) as well as precursor to highly 
reactive cobalt oxyhydroxies, so that operation under homoge
neous or heterogenized conditions is possible.14,18 This in turn 
has attracted major interest for surfacedeposition as co
catalyst on BiVO4 photoanodes. For example, Ryu et al.
