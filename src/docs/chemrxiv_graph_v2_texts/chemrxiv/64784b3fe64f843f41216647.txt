Description:
The universal energetic and ubiquitous molecule driving biological processes such as cellular division.

Stimulusresponsive self
assembly of molecular bricks through noncovalent interactions appears as an interesting 
alternative as it opens the possibility of dynamic actuation of inherently passive molecules 
without needing to modify them. This approach has already been demonstrated relevant for a 
large number of applications ranging from chemical sensors to drugdelivery systems9. The 
resulting stimuliresponsive selfassembled systems are of particular interest when involving 
biological molecules to dynamically control their functions10,11,12,13. Among biologically active 
molecules, nucleotides and analogues appear as particularly interesting targets for such a 
purpose 14. For instance, adenosine 5triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energetic and 
ubiquitous molecule driving biological processes such as cellular division and whose 
concentration can correlate with pathological conditions, for instance in Parkinsons disease15.
