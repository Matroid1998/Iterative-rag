Description:
Organic compounds that promote the methanol to DME reaction under milder conditions.

Text:
Addition of organic carbonyl compounds fur
ther promotes the methanol to DME reaction allowing for use
of milder reaction conditions; this reduces the risk of catalyst
deactivation and side reactions in the hydrocarbon pool mech
anism.7 The aliphatic esters and aromatic aldehydes investigated
here have shown significant promotional effects (increasing cat
alytic activity by well over an order of magnitude) down to con
centrations as low as 1 ppm in methanol.79
Our previous work employed a set of multilevel quantum cal
culations to investigate the action of aliphatic ester promoters in
DME formation from methanol dehydration within HZSM5.10
Our results showed how the promoters provide a more favourable
route to DME formation. The promoters adsorption to the reac
tion site is one crucial factor.
