Description:
A base element in carbon-based products formed from the reduction of CO2.

Text:
The conversion of CO2 into energydense carbonbased products, and hence the closure of the carbon 
cycle in a circular approach, is a very attractive solution for the reduction of the atmospheric CO2 
content and for the storage of fluctuating renewable energy into chemical energy. Various 
technologies to reduce CO2, such as thermochemical, electrochemical, photochemical and biochemical 
processes have been explored in recent years.
