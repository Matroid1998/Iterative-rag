Used in Li-ion batteries, which power most consumer electronics and hybrid-electric vehicles.

Today, innovation in battery technologies is urged by widely recognized concerns regarding
the sustainability of stateoftheart Liion batteries (LIB). Currently, LIBs power most consumer
electronics in the market and the move towards hybridelectrically powered transportation is posing
even higher demands for LIBs production. This has caused a sharp raise on the cost of Li raw
materials and has brought a concern on an accelerated depletion of Li natural sources 1, 2, 3. Due
to the high abundance of Na on the earth crust and a much lower cost as compared to Li, Naion
based batteries (SIBs) are deemed to be a suitable candidate to replace LIBs 1, 2, 3. However,
some intrinsic properties of Na bring some performance limitations to SIBs.

Description:
Has a theoretical capacity of 3,829 mAh g1 as an anode.

Text:
Due to a larger atomic
weight of Na, the theoretical capacity of a Na anode is smaller (1,165 mAh g1) than that of a Li
anode (3,829 mAh g1) 3. The standard reduction potential of Na (2.7 V vs. SHE) is higher
(easier to reduce) than that of Li (3.07 V vs. SHE), which implies a slightly narrower (300 mV)
working voltage window, and thus an inferior energy density 3. Moreover, the larger size of the
Naions (1.06 A cation radius) as compared to Li (0.76 A cation radius) requires suitable crystal
structures that are able to intercalate the larger Naions in a reversible manner 2, 3.
