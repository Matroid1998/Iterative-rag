Description:
Used as junctions in native chemical ligation (NCL) for protein synthesis.

Text:
NCL has been 
extended beyond Cys junctions via freeradical desulfurization, a robust technique that 
allows the more common Ala, as well as other amino acids amenable to thiol 
surrogates, to be used as ligation junctions.45 NCL has produced many useful synthetic 
proteins,67 including targets for mirrorimage drug discovery,812 functional native and 
mirrorimage enzymes,1318 mirrorimage proteins for racemic crystallography,1922 and 
proteins containing complex posttranslational modifications.2326 

However, NCL has several challenges that limit its scope in chemical protein 
synthesis (CPS).7,27 First, NCL requires high peptide concentrations, typically  1 mM, 
at neutral pH for efficient ligation.
