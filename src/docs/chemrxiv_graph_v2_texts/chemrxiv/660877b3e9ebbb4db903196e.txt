The development of new green solvents for CCS has represented a challenge due to the wide
range of molecular structures and materials that can be used as absorption agents 33. Promising al
ternative solvents include supercritical uids, ionic liquids (ILs) and Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs). ILs are promising substitutes for aminebased solvents; their appeal lies on advantageous physico
chemical properties such as minimal vapor pressure, nonammability, robust thermal stability, and
high CO2 solubility 24, 38. However, the application of ILs as solvents faces challenges, including
their high viscosity and substantial costs, along with complex synthesis and purication processes
13. Additionally, concerns over their poor biodegradability hinders their commercial potential 5. DESs have also been studied as alternatives for CO2 capture 28, 29.
