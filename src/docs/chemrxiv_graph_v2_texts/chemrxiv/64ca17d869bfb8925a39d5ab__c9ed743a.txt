Description:
A surface on which ammonia decomposition occurs, relevant for hydrogen-based economy.

Text:
Here, we unravel the complex dynamic behaviour of a catalytic process in
operando conditions by investigating the ammonia decomposition on a lithium
imide (Li2NH) surface, a process that has received much attention for its pos
sible role in a future sustainable hydrogenbased economy9,10,11,12,13,14 We
perform state of the art simulations in which the interatomic forces are calcu
lated with an accuracy close to that of ab initio molecular dynamics15. Our
simulations reveal that the reactive process induces a change of state of the
interface. Such a modified interfacial state is the actual catalytic medium, and
one does not need to invoke any special stable arrangement of atoms.

Description:
Exhibits superionic behavior with fast-diffusing Li cations and oscillating divalent imide anions.

Text:
Like many other ionic systems20 in
which there is a large difference between anionic and cationic radii, lithium
imide exhibits a superionic behaviour21,22 with the Li cations fast diffusing
and the divalent imide anions oscillating around their equilibrium positions
(Fig. 1b). As the temperature increases, Li cations sitting in a tetrahedral
site can move first to an octahedral empty site, and then to a tetrahedral
vacancy (Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). The ease with
