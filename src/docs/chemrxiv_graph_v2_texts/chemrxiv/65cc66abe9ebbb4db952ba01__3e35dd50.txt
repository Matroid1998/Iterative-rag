Zinc oxide is an interesting metal oxide material that has gained 
attention in materials science recently because of its unique properties, which include 
broad radiation absorption, catalytic activity, high mechanical and chemical stability, 
electrochemical coupling, and nontoxic behaviour (Mohan  Renjanadevi, 2016). Its 
nano size is especially intriguing. Particles that range in size from one to one hundred 
nanometres are referred to as nanosized particles (Khan et al., 2019). Among the many 
types of nanoparticles, semiconductor nanoparticles have drawn major attention due 
to their unique properties and wide range of potential uses. Semiconductor 
nanoparticles are useful in electronics, medicine, and environmental remediation 
because they differ from their bulk counterparts in their electronic and optical 
properties.

Description:
Nanoparticles with exceptional photocatalytic activity, wide bandgap, and biocompatibility.

In this instance, semiconductor nanoparticles of particular interest are zinc 
oxide nanoparticles (Subhan et al., 2022). ZnO nanoparticles have gained prominence 
due to their exceptional photocatalytic activity, wide bandgap, and biocompatibility. These nanoparticles are noteworthy as semiconductor materials, playing a pivotal role 
in a diverse array of applications. Their multifunctionality and versatility make ZnO 
nanoparticles indispensable in various fields (Hossain et al., 2023). The process of synthesis of nanoparticles is a significant factor that influences their 
properties and applications. While several methods exist for nanoparticle synthesis, 
green synthesis is gaining increasing popularity owing to its lower environmental 
impact (Patel, 2022). This ecofriendly approach involves the use of plant extracts, 
microorganisms, or other sustainable sources as reducing or stabilizing agents in the 
synthesis process.
