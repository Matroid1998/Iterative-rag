Description:
Atoms that can be randomly inserted into molecules, potentially leading to high scores in fitness functions but undesirable properties.

The emphasis on general distribution learn
ing, while important, may not fully capture the models
performance in addressing specific chemical challenges. Additionally, performances on taskoriented benchmarks
based on simple heuristic fitness functions, such as penal
ized log wateroctanol partition coefficient 1, 44, sim
ilarityrediscovery tasks 18, 39, or quantitative esti
mate of druglikeliness (QED) 45, are handily maxi
mized by modern generative models 4648, and even
trivially satisfied by randomly inserting carbon atoms
into the molecules 49. These simplistic fitness func
tions often fail to capture chemical constraints, allowing
models to exploit failure modes by reward hacking, and
generate molecules with high scores but undesirable prop
erties, such as chemical instability or synthetic infeasibil
ity 50, 51.
