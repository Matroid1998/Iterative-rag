Description:
Electron rich compounds used in nucleophilic phosphine catalysis.

Text:
Lewis base catalysis1 with tertiary phosphines, often referred to as nucleophilic phosphine catalysis, 
relies on the conjugate addition of a sufficiently electron rich tertiary phosphine to an electron deficient 
multiple bond forming an energetically disfavoured zwitterionic species. This zwitterion can then be 
trapped with nucleophiles, electrophiles or a combination of both, resulting in manifold applications of 
this methodology in preparative chemistry.2 A special case of a reaction with an electrophile is the proton 
transfer of an acidic proton from another reagent, e.g. an alcohol, to the zwitterion. This reaction results 
in the formation of an ion pair consisting of the corresponding phosphonium cation and the corresponding 
base of the acidic reagent as the newly formed anion, e.g. an alkoxide (Figure 1).

In such cases, a Lewis base catalyst 
might be the better choice. Commonly used 
Lewis 
base 
catalysts 
are 
tertiary 
phosphines,3,12 amines like 4dimethylamino
pyridine13 and Nhetereocyclic carbenes.14 
Highly reactive nucleophiles such as trialkyl
phosphines or NHCs often suffer from poor air 
and moisture stability or require a strong base 
to be formed from their precursors. Therefore, the quest for an air and moisture insensitive Lewis base 
catalyst with high activity is ongoing. Recently, we have reported a step towards this direction by showing 
that the electron rich tris(4methoxyphenyl)phosphine (TMPP, Fig. 1) is more active in converting poor and 
intermediate Michael acceptors than triphenylphosphine (TPP).15 Regrettably, the improvement in activity 
was not that pronounced that TMPP could rival the performance of phosphazene bases.
