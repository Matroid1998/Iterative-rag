Description:
A reactive carbon species that plays diverse biochemical roles in physiology and disease.

Text:
Formaldehyde (FA) is a reactive carbon species that plays diverse biochemical roles in 
physiology and disease across all kingdoms of life. This onecarbon aldehyde is a ubiquitous 
environmental toxin, where its sources include vehicle exhaust and forest fires, and in the chemical 
industry in the formulation of household products like plywood and resins.1 Indeed, the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated FA as a human carcinogen with the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) setting permissible exposure limits of 0.75 
ppm in workplace air.2,3 Elevations in FA are associated with serious diseases, including cancer, 
neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, and diabetes.4,5 Concurrently, cells produce FA
