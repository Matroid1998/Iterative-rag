Description:
An oxidation state of copper that occurs at potentials around 1 V and higher.

Text:
However, 
irreversible oxidation to Cu(III) could be registered only at potentials around 1 V and higher (all 
potentials referred to vs. the AgAgCl reference potential), and therefore this process is biologically 
irrelevant.
