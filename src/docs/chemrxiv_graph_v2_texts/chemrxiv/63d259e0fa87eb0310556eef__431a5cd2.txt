Description:
A component in NMC cathode materials, with increasing content in each iteration for improved performance.

Decarbonisation of the automotive industry has highlighted battery technologies as a viable suc
cessor to petroleumbased travel. With increasing performance of stateoftheart Liion battery
materials comes a tendency to initiate degradative mechanisms more rapidly than acceptable
for commercially viable products. Even with the greatest gravimetric and volumetric density,
promising transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials can suer from limited cycle life, high
cost, and reduced performance. NMC (Li1Ni1xy Mnx CoyO2) based Liion batteries have
emerged as the most promising successor to LiCoO2 chemistry and could potentially facilitate
ubiquitous adoption of Liion in mobile and transport devices.1 High specic capacities, high
rate capability, and longterm cycling abilities are driving extensive research into these cathode
materials, forcing a greater nickel content with each iteration.

Description:
Has redox capability making it attractive for Li-ion operation.

Text:
The redox capability of nickel
makes it highly attractive for Liion operation, being able to cycle between Ni(II) and Ni(III)
as well as Ni(III) to Ni(IV) without a signicant deviation in operational voltage.

Description:
An element that increases the specific capacity of NMC811 cathodes.

Text:
This has
presented as an increase in nickel content to the current NMC811 cathode, which exhibits a
specic capacity of 190  220 mAh.g1.2
Initial observations of NMC811 by Xray diraction show an expansion in the clattice param
eter followed by a drastic reduction shortly after 4.1 V vs LiLi, often termed the lattice
collapse.2,3 Upwards of 4.1 V, delithiation is signicant enough to reduce the interlayer spacing
between TMoxygen layers to less than that of a fully lithiated lattice.2,4 The evolution in the
a and clattice parameters coincides with a total unit cell volumetric reduction; during charg
ing, the removal of lithium causes a contraction in the TMO bond length from 2.87 to 2.81
, manifesting in a shrinkage of the alattice parameter.
