Description:
Electronically activated compounds involved in the cleavage of a PN bond.

Text:
reported the ring
expansion of a five to sevenmembered ring via the 
cleavage of a PN bond with electronically activated 
alkynes.16 
The 
products 
were 
characterised 
crystallographically and spectroscopically, although
