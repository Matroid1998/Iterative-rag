Used as a substrate in composite structures fabricated by chemical etching.

Various methods have been proposed to 
improve the mechanical durabilities of SHSs. While, for example, Liu et al. used composite 
ceramic coating to improve mechanical durability16, some soft materials are also good choices 
for antiabrasion SHSs17. Hierarchal roughnesses are widely used to improve the hydrophobicity and durability of 
SHS14.For example, Groten et al.10manufactured three types of photolithographically created 
structural model surfaces (microscale structures, nanoscale structures and composite structures) 
that were ioncouple plasmaetched to produce SHSs with improved mechanical durability. Based ontheir results, they hypothesized that the composite structures had increased mechanical 
stability. Ou et al.15 reported similar composite structures on copper substrates, fabricated by chemical 
etching. Then, treatment of the etched surface with 1H,1H,2H,2Hperfluorodecanethiol produced
