Description:
Essential to control mineralization and avoid undesired calcium phosphate formation.

Text:
Pyrophosphate is essential to control miner
alization, avoiding undesired calcium phosphate (hydrox
yapatite) formation, while growing CPPD crystals at ele
vated pyrophosphate levels.79 As a result of the im
portance of phosphate species, receptors capable of effec
tively binding, sensing, or transporting these species are 
of great interest. 1014
