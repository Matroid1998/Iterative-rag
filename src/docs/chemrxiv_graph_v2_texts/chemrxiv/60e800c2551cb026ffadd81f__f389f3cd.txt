The use of petroleum as a feedstock for energy production is declining. However, certain 
34 
critical functions cannot safely be replaced by renewable energy.1 Secondly. petroleum is a 
35 
fundamental feedstock for the production of a large number of chemical starting materials.2,3 
36 
Therefore, reducing the environmental impact of oil production is an important goal. This 
37 
requires a better understanding of petroleum on the molecular level. Crude oil is a complex 
38 
mixture of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons with a smaller fraction of heteroatom
39 
containing compounds, i.e. the resins and asphaltenes.
