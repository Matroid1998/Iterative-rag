Description:
A high potential active site involved in electron transfer pathways in proteins.

Text:
Electron transfer (ET) reactions are key steps in various biological processes such as photosyn
thesis and respiration 2. One finds many examples of protein networks consisting of Tyr and
Trp residues in branched chains in 3; the path of electron flow leads from a high potential heme
active site through various residues at fixed potential, and terminates at a lowest potential residue
situated at the exterior of the protein. A computer implementation of an ET network in generic
form first appears in 4 where the matrix exponential solver is used to provide concentrationtime
solutions to arbitrary firstorder chemical reaction networks, one of which is an ET network. Warren 7 modeled a twostep electron transfer kinetic system as a reversibly coupled chain of
three species.
