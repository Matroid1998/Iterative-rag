Description:
Used in sodium ion batteries with Prussian Blue-based compounds as the cathode material.

The results of the research are currently starting to show, as large companies like
CATL,7 Altris AB,8 and Natron Energy9 prepare to produce their first SIBs. Despite the
ongoing investigation of various cell chemistries involving potential cathode materials such
as layered oxides,1012 polyanionic compounds,1114 and organic materials,15,16 the afore
mentioned companies share one unique attribute they all focus on Prussian Bluebased
compounds as the cathode material in their upcoming sodium ion battery production.
