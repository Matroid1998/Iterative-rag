Silymarin, an extract from fruits and seeds of the milk thistle Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn., 
69 
is basically a flavonolignan complex.1,2 Although its composition may vary depending on the 
70 
source, 70 is made up of the flavonolignans silybin A and B, isosilybin A and B, silychristin 
71 
A and B, silydianin and the flavanol taxifolin.

Description:
Minor components include isosilychristin and 2,3dehydro derivatives.

Minor components include the flavonolignan 
72 
isosilychristin and the corresponding 2,3dehydro derivatives of various flavonolignans, such 
73 
as 2,3dehydrosilybin, 2,3dehydrosilychristin and 2,3dehydrosilydianin.3,4

Metaanalyzes of clinical trials show that silymarin plays an important complementary role in 
75 
the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, especially in terms of lowering levels of 
76 
alanine and aspartate transaminases.5,6 
77 
It has been shown to reduce hepatic fibrosis markers and serum levels of transforming growth 
78 
factor beta1 (TGF1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), and interleukin 6 (IL6) in 
79 
patients with chronic hepatitis B.6 Furthermore, it decreased total cholesterol and lowdensity 
80 
lipoprotein (LDL) levels while increasing highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) levels in 
81 
hyperlipidemic individuals.7 The hepatoprotective effects may be attributed to influencing 
82 
metabolic pathways to increase hepatic glutathione synthesis and cysteine availability, leading 
83 
to higher antioxidant lipid defense in the liver8 or altering growth factormediated cell 
84 
signaling pathways,9 as demonstrated by in vivo studies.
