Description:
An electrophile whose relative Lewis acidity can be controlled for fluoride transfer.

Text:
However, by controlling the relative Lewis acidity of the carbon and boron electrophiles 
it is possible to effect fluoride transfer from fluoroborates to carbon electrophiles. One classic example is BF4 
reacting as a stoichiometric fluoride source in the BalzSchiemann reaction, but this requires a highly reactive Aryl 
electrophile.5 To expand the utility of fluoroborates in nucleophilic fluorinations it is highly desirable to (i) use sub
stoichiometric fluoroborate and stoichiometric MF, i.e. use boranes as MF phase transfer catalysts; (ii) fluorinate 
carbon electrophiles less reactive than e.g. Aryl.
