Undergo alkylation with halo glutarimide.

The exploration of novel glutarimidecontain
ing CBMs can alter the activity, depth of degradation, pharma
cokineticpharmacodynamic properties, and offtarget ne
osubstrate selectivity, which can impact the overall success of 
a potential degrader in the clinic.7 
One emerging class of CBMs is the N(hetero)aryl glu
tarimide, which has begun to find applications in a range of 
disease targets.8, 9 Despite the promise of this CBM in degrader 
drug discovery, efforts to rigorously explore structureactivity 
relationships (SAR) have been limited by the inefficient and be
spoke synthetic strategies currently employed (Figure 1B). Such strategies fall into two categories 1) alkylation of anilines 
with an halo glutarimide and 2) CN crosscoupling of a 
dibenzoyl pyridine which reveals the glutarimide after high
pressure hydrogenation.

On the other hand, while the CN crosscoupling of 
anilines and aryl halides may incorporate a broader substrate 
scope, this mitigative approach is still stymied by the subse
quent hydrogenation step, whose selectivity and efficiency de
pends on compatibility any appended functional group and the 
electronic properties of substrates. As an example, 4 was pre
pared with only 20 yield over 4 steps from commercially 
available starting material 3.11 The aforementioned limitations 
lead to an unmet need in medicinal chemistry for a robust and
