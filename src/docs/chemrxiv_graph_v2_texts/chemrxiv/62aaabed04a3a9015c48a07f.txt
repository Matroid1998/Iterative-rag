Description:
Reagents used in generating organolithium species through various methods such as lithiation and deprotonation.

Text:
Organolithium reagents play an important role in organic synthesis due to their high 
reactivity that warrants versatile applications.1 Accordingly, many methods have been 
developed for generating organolithium species, including lithiation at carbonheteroatom 
bonds, deprotonation at acidic CH bonds, and addition of lithium reagents across unsaturated 
bonds.
