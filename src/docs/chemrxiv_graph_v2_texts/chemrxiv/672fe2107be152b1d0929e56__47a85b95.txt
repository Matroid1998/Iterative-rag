Description:
Stable, crystalline substances derived from carbonyl compounds and alcohols, used to generate sp3-sp3, sp3-sp2, and sp3-sp linkages.

Text:
Herein we disclose a 
remarkably general platform for redoxneutral radical crosscouplings driven by in situ derived 
alkyl diazenes to forge a variety of CC bonds. Alkyl sulfonyl hydrazides are easily derived from 
carbonyl compounds and alcohols (Nsulfonyl regioisomers can be used interchangeably); these 
stable, crystalline substances can now be employed to generate a variety of useful sp3sp3, sp3sp2, 
and sp3sp linkages in a practical, dump and stir fashion, obviating the need for any external 
redoxactivation.
