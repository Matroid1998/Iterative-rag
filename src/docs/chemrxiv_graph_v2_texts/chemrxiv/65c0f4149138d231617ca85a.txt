Description:
A less stable ligand system used in various applications.

Text:
Kinetically inert lanthanide(III) complexes based on lig
ands derived from cyclen and TACN have been used in 
many forms of bioimaging and diagnostics.113 Less stable 
DTPA, cryptands, and siderophorebased ligand systems 
are also prevalent.14, 15 A common denominator in many of 
these systems, especially the macrocyclic systems, is that 
they adopt several forms with different chirality in solu
tion.1620 However, when a chiral agent is added, the equi
librium between the different isomers may be perturbed.11, 
2125 This is important, as biological systems are inherently 
chiral.
