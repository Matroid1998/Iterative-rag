Description:
A rare-earth silicate used in environmental barrier coatings.

Text:
Rareearth silicates (i.e., R2SiO5 and R2Si2O7; R  rareeath elements) have increasingly
attracted attention for their application to environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). EBCs are
necessary to protect ceramic matrix composites against hightemperature corroding environ
ments in hotsection components of advanced gasturbine engines 13 since the mid2000s
4. To clarify an optimal layered system and suitable processes, degradation behaviors of
EBC systems, including rareearth silicates, under water vapor and oxygen atmospheres at
high temperatures have been extensively investigated, especially within the past decade 5
16, along with countermeasures against CaMgFeAlsilicate (CMAS) attacks 2, 3. The
degradation processes are determined by the selected compositions of EBC layers and by
multiple closely related microstructural factors with temporal changes (e.g., crystallinity,
grain size, heterointerface structure, porosity, cracks, layer thicknesses, and related thermal
stresses).
