Description:
Displays a first-order structural phase transition at 57Â°C from a non-centrosymmetric to a centrosymmetric structure.

Text:
Phase transitions between crystalline HOIP polymorphs upon 
application of external stimuli such as temperature or pressure are 
relatively common. Such transitions are commonly associated with, 
amongst other factors, displacement of the organic A site cation, and 
a 
large 
anisotropic 
thermal 
expansion.18 
For 
example, 
TPrAMn(dca)3 (TPrA  tetrapropylammonium, (CH3CH2CH2)4N), 
displays a firstorder structural phase transition at 57 C from a non
centrosymmetric structure (space group P421c), to a high 
temperature polymorph with the centrosymmetric space group 
I4mcm.19 
 Despite the dominance of the solid crystalline state in the family, 
several HOIPs have recently been demonstrated the ability to melt 
into liquid phases.21,22 This is unusual given the thermal 
decomposition observed prior to melting in most organicinorganic 
networks.23,24 Dicyanamidebased hybrid organicinorganic ABX3
