Description:
Heavy atom effect leads to large intersystem crossing rates in Ru complexes, forming triplet excited states quickly after photoexcitation.

Text:
In homoleptic Rupolypyridyl complexes, polarizationdependent experiments have shown that 
the excited electron in the initial FranckCondon state is delocalized over all ligands.5 However, 
the interactions of the chromophore with solvent molecules leads to rapid decoherence and 
localization of the electronic density on one of the ligands. Due to the Ru heavyatom effect, 
intersystemcrossing rates in Rucomplexes are large and the triplet excited states are often formed 
within the first hundred femtoseconds after photoexcitation. The complexes with lowestenergy 
3MLCT states tend to have long excitedstate lifetimes and decent photostability, while the 
presence of closelying MC states generally shortens the lifetimes and leads to ligand dissociation
based photochemistry.2 As the ligand conjugation is increased, the longlived triplet LC states tend 
to dominate the photophysical behavior of Rupolypyridyl complexes.6,7
