Description:
A model system for developing mechanistic understanding of photoinduced ligand exchange.

Text:
As the precursor to Cr(CO)5alkane, one of the first ever ob
served alkane complexes11,13,14, chromium hexacarbonyl 
(Cr(CO)6) has long served as a model systems for both, devel
oping a general mechanistic understanding of photoinduced 
ligand exchange as well as gaining specific insight into the na
ture and properties of alkane complexes6. However, while 
constituting a thoroughly studied model system, experimentally 
resolving the ultrafast timescales of the formation of Cr(CO)5
alkane complexes has proven difficult. NMR spectroscopy is 
intrinsically slow compared to ligandexchange dynamics, and 
can only probe species, which are metastable on nano to
