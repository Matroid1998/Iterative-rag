Description:
A molecule prepared for potential use in energy storage.

Text:
Although scientific research has achieved dazzling achievements in both the 
storage of alkalimetal ions (M  Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) and the preparation of 
cyclocarbon molecules, the use of cyclocarbons for energy storage has not been 
reported. The exploration of the properties of materials formed by M doped 
cyclocarbons is therefore also blank. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024x1bsd ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000270791907 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
