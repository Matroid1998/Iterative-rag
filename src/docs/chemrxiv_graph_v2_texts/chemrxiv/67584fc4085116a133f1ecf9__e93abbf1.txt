Description:
Involved in 3+2 cycloaddition reactions with sultams.

Text:
In this work, we report a comprehensive study on the 3  2 
cycloaddition reactions of five and sixmembered ,unsaturated 
sultams of general formula 1 as a general approach to fused sp3
enriched heterocyclic building blocks for early drug discovery 
programs (Scheme 1, A). We established the scope and limitations 
of these transformations depending on the nature of the 1,3dipolar 
component and demonstrated their high regio and stereoselectivity. In addition to that, antiviral activity was found for some of the 
synthesized cycloadducts. It should be noted that a very limited 
number of similar cycloadditions was reported in the literature, 
including the DielsAlder reaction of sultams (B)1921 and 3  2 
cycloaddition of sulton 2 with nitrile oxides or nitrones (C).22
