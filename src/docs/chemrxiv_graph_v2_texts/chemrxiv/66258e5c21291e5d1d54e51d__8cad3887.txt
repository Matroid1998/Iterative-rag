Description:
Involved in peptide ligation by oxidative coupling with amino acids.

This enhanced local 
concentration and exchange has been shown to affect the kinetics of reactions in coacervates.816 
Additionally, the local polarity, crowding, pH and water activity can have substantial effects on the 
energy landscape of reactions, affecting both reaction rates and pathways.17 
A wide range of reactions have been shown to be enhanced by localization to a coacervate, 
including enzymatic8,12,1416,18 and nanoparticlecatalysed8,19 reactions, ribozyme reactions,13,2022 
reactions between synthetic and prebioticallyrelevant small molecules,911,23,24 templatedirected 
RNA polymerization,25 DNA ligation26 and cellfree gene expression.27 Our group has recently also 
shown that coacervates can lead to preferential formation of specific products in peptide ligation by 
oxidative coupling of amidothioacids and amino acids,24 showcasing that coacervates can not only 
accelerate reactions, but also direct reaction pathways.
