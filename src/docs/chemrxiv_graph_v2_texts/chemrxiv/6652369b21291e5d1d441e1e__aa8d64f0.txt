Description:
Forms crystal structures with B12 or B11C icosahedra connected by triatomic chains, known for strong covalent BB and BC bonding.

Rhombohedralboron carbide (rBxC) forms crystal structures where B12 or B11C icosahedra are 
connected by triatomic chains forming a 3D network with strong covalent BB and BC 
bonding, typically rendering the stoichiometry B4C or B13C2. This crystal structure makes boron 
carbide very hard and it is typically used in plate armor and as an abrasive material.14 The high 
boron content and high mechanical and chemical stability have also made BxC a promising 
candidate for neutron converter layers in solidstate neutron detectors where 10B converts 
neutrons to detectable particles.59 Less explored are the optoelectronic1013 and the 
thermoelectric properties1418 of rBxC, the wide range of composition and material stability19,20 
make the material promising also for radiationresistant heterostructures and thermoelectric 
devices respectively.
