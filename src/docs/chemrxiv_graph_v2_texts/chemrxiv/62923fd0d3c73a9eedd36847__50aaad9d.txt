of the Ptmodification and polymer inhibitor. (52, 54) The composition 
of the deposited metal film was characterized by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Xray 
diffraction (XRD). In Figure 2b, the peaks at 932.5 and 952.5 eV in the Cu 2p scan confirm the existence 
of the metallic Cu(0). The shifted Cu 2p32 peak at 934.5 eV and the satellite around 944 eV correspond 
to the small amount of CuO. (60) The composition analysis of Cu shows that there is 25.11 CuO. After 
electrodeposition, XRD analyses reveal peaks at 43.4 and 50.5 appearing on the ultrawideband 
transparent electrode can be assigned to the Cu (111) and Cu (200),(61, 62) as shown in Figure 2c. There 
is no signal for the crystallized CuO in the XRD data.

Description:
Exists only in the top surface layer of the sample.

Text:
Since the XPS analyzes the top surface layer of the 
sample and XRD delivers the much deeper measurement, we infer that the CuO only exists in the top 
surface layer, which elucidates that the metallic Cu dominates the electrodeposition process and results 
in low emissivity. For practical applications as the building envelope, the electrochromic device must have longterm 
durability. Figures 2d and e show the cycle test of the midIR emissivity tuning. The large emissivity 
contrast can be maintained for 1000 cycles and only degrade 21 after 1800 cycles, which exhibits a 
significant improvement from the previous reports using AgDMSO electrolyte (only up to 300400 
cycles). (40, 52) The emissivity spectra maintain their broadband feature after 2500 cycles (Figure 2e).
