Description:
Used in the conversion of BiI3 for photovoltaic applications.

There has also 
been a significant interest in the exploration of BiI3 as a photovoltaic material 10. This is 
accomplished typically either by converting it into a methyl ammonium compound (see, for 
instance, 11) and further doping it 12, or by preparing organicinorganic hybrid systems 
13 or by directly using it in an organic photovoltaic cell 10, 14. The latter study uses a 
lowtemperature solvothermal technique to prepare bismuth iodide. Recently, Wei et al 15 
have used PVDsynthesized 2D layered nanoplates of BiI3 for visiblelight photodetection. Bismuth iodide has also been explored as catalysts for deprotection of acetals and ketals 16. Finally, bismuth iodide nanowires have been obtained by calcination of a sonochemically
synthesized supramolecular precursor in a study by Soltanzadeh and Morsali 17.
