Description:
Forms phosphate-bearing phases that are relatively well characterized.

Text:
For example, transition metal phosphates such as Zr6, Sn7, Ni or Co8 
phosphates garnered attention as lowcost, chemically stable and tunable proton conductors 
for fuel cells 916. However, to effectively harvest metal and phosphate in a form of TMPs and 
convert them to functional materials, one needs to elucidate their nucleation and 
crystallization pathways from aqueous solutions. Although, the synthesis and precipitation of 
Mg or Ca phosphatebearing phases are relatively well characterized 1719, investigations of the 
crystallization of transition metal phosphate materials are relatively scarce and focus on 
mineralogical aspects20. Most of the available studies concentrate on the incorporation or 
adsorption of transition metals and metalloids10, 2124 rather than their complete substitution 
in phosphatebased compounds 2527.
