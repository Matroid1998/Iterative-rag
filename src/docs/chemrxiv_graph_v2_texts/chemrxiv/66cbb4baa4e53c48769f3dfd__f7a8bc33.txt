Nanotechnology fields are focusing to innovate new performance nanomaterials for several engineering fields to meet the
mankind needs. Such fields concern materials engineering and catalysis as they are known as central sciences, which deeply
contribute to the nation building and development through nanotechnology growth. As known the protection and cleaning our
environment from both inorganic and organic wastes is highly needed 1,2. the development of intelligent nanomaterials are
so regarded in fuel cells technologies 36, conversion of both harmful and harmless products 78, in hydrogen production
9, and so fourth. Nowadays, many hybrid materials are elaborated and characterized to allow several applications,such as in
engineering technologies, biomedical applications, medicinal applications to treat such as cancer, diabetes, virus, and so on.
