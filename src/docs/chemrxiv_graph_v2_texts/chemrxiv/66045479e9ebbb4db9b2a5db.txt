Description:
A compound functionalized on magnetic particles to manipulate hybrid materials magnetically and by light, with low solubility in aqueous media due to low polarity.

Text:
Isomerization of azocompounds has been used to 
change the affinity to metal ions,5 the binding to organic molecules, for example in hostguest 
chemistry6,7 or in biological applications,8 to modulate catalysis9 and for reversible assembly of 
nanostructures.10,11 Magnetic particles have been functionalized with azobenzene and its 
derivatives utilize the ability to manipulate the hybrid material magnetically and by light. These 
examples are mainly studied in organic solvents because of the low polarity of azocompounds 
and therefore low solubility in aqueous media.1215 However, waterdispersible, photoresponsive 
MNP are advantageous for biomedical applications in photopharmacology or drug delivery. One 
way to achieve polar azobenzene decorated NP was reported by Klajn and coworkers.16 They
