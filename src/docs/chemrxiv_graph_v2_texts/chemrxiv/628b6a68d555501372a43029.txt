Description:
Has a tetrahedral structure with CCC angles of 109.47 degrees.

It is relevant to observe interconnectedness between solid state and organic domains regarding the 
chemistry of carbon. Inspired from 2D 1,4cyclohexadiene planar molecule (Fig. 1a) was enclosed 
in the so called glitter structure with tetragonal hexacarbon C6, thus mirroring the molecule in a 
crystal 1. The structure shown in Fig. 1b consists of cornersharing tetrahedra of C(sp3) white 
spheres in the a,b plane, connected by CC double bonds along cdirection. The crystal data 
detailed in Table 1 point to a distorted tetrahedron with angles departing from the perfect 
tetrahedron angle CCC  109.47 found, for instance, in methane CH4 or diamond. Due to the 
two kinds of connectivity (Fig.
