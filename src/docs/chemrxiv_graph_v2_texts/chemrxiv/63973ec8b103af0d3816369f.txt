Description:
A crucial component in the next generation of carbon capture and storage systems.

Molecular adsorption has many largescale industrial applications in our society, includ
ing fluid storage, molecular separation and purification, and is therefore a very active area
of research in both chemistry and materials science. Improvement of the performance of
adsorptionbased processes could reduce the environmental impact of the separation and
purification applications by replacing energyintensive processes such as cryogenic distil
lation.1,2 In the energy industry, the use of nanoporous solids is a promising lowenergy
alternative to pressurized gas tanks for the storage of fuel such as H2 or CH4.3 Adsorption
is also foreseen to be a crucial component in the next generation of carbon capture and
storage systems.4 To further unfold the potential of this technology, the design of materials
for targeted applications needs to be refined.
