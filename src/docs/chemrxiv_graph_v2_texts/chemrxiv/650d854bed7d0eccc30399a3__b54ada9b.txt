Description:
Known to have a P2 phase in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

compositions of Na0.78Ni0.23Mn0.69O2, Na0.67Ni0.2Mn0.8O2, 
Na0.5Ni0.25Mn0.75O2, and Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2.2 Among these materials, Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is 
one of the most common compositions, and it is known to have a P2 phase in SIBs (following 
Delmas notation).3 Although oxygen redox in the high voltage region is known to initially 
improve the storage capacity in layered oxides, it ultimately can result in capacity fade due to 
a combination of oxygen loss and cation migration.4 Another process that causes capacity
