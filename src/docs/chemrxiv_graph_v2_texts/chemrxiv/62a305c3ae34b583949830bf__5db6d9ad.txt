Description:
A complex that activates NH and OH bonds under UV light in the presence of excess organic substrate.

1B).7 Examples of this reactivity are found in biol
ogy,8 catalysis,9 coordination chemistry7a or ammonia synthe
sis.10 Yet, such reactivity is largely dominated by transition met
als, and examples dealing with main group elements remain 
rare.11, 12 For example, a germanium corrole complex (group 14) 
has been reported to activate NH and OH bonds under UV 
light and in the presence of a large excess of organic sub
strate.11a, 13 Without irradiation, low yields were obtained at 
higher temperatures and extended reactions times.
