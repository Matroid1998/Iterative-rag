Description:
Synthesized from N(1cyano2phenyl)ethyl carbamates.

Text:
4Methoxy3methyl ringdisubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) was 
involved in the discovery of potent, orally bioavailable pyrimidine5carbonitrile6alkyl 
CXCR2 receptor antagonists 1, and in synthesis of methoxytolylsuccinic acids 2. 3
Ethoxy4(2hydroxyethoxy) ringdisubstituted ethyl PCA is reported in syntheses of 4
benzyl2imidazolidinones from N(1cyano2phenyl)ethyl carbamates 3, whereas 3,4
diethoxy PCA in synthesis of 3hydroxypyridines via condensation of aromatic aldehydes 
with ethyl cyanoacetate 4. 3,4Dibenzyloxy ringdisubstituted ethyl PCA was part of 
synthesis and studies of in vitro anticancer activity of new 2thioxooxazolidin4one 
derivatives 5. 4Benzyloxy3methoxyphenyl ethyl PCA was part of solventfree antimony 
trichloride catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction under microwave irradiation 6, 7.
