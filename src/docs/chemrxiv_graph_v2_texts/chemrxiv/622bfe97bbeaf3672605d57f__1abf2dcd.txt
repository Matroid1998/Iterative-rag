Coronaviruses of the genus 
45 
Alphacoronaviridae, which contains some of the common cold coronaviruses, and 
46 
Betacoronaviridae, which contains the three wellknown coronaviruses MERSCoV, SARSCoV, 
47 
and SARSCoV2, have been isolated from wildlife such as bats, palm civets, and camels.1,2 The 
48 
alphacoronaviruses HCoVNL63 and HCoV229E and the betacoronaviruses HCoVOC43 and 
49 
HCoVHKU1 are the endemic human coronaviruses that typically result in the common cold.2 
50 
These viruses usually cause only mild respiratory illness, but can result in more severe disease in 
51 
immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, and infants.2 A third genus, including porcine delta
52 
coronavirus holds zoonotic potential, as strains have recently been identified in plasma samples of 
53 
three Haitian children.3 
54 
The noted potential for zoonotic transmission and the emergence of novel coronaviruses 
55 
creates an urgent need to rapidly develop new broadspectrum antiviral therapies in addition to 
56 
those that currently circulate, e.g., SARSCoV2.4,5 In the previous MERSCoV and SARSCoV 
57 
outbreaks, the fatality rates were 35 and 10, respectively, but the number of infected 
58 
individuals was relatively low with 2,574 and 8,422 cases, respectively.6,7 A striking deviation 
59 
from this pattern has been observed for SARSCoV2, which, since December 2019 and as of 
60 
March, 2022, has infected over 450 million people and killed over 6 million people globally.810 
61 
As the pandemic continues ravaging the world, its effects on society, poverty, the environment, 
62 
and the economy grow.11,12 Despite the desperate need for therapies, there are currently no 
63 
approved drugs to treat any of these coronaviruses, though several including tocilizumab, 
64 
sotrovimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, casirivimab, imdevimab, and baricitinib have been
