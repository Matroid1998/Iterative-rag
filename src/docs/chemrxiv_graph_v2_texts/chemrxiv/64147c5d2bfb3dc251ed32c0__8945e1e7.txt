Description:
Basic compounds used in aqueous systems for CO2 selective chemical scrubbing.

The development of 
49 
a technology for mitigation of CO2 emissions from flue gas streams by the use of CCU is therefore imperative, 
50 
and the progress of these technologies to reduce the associated costs remain an essential element in the 
51 
journey toward carbon neutrality. 52 
One of the most mature technologies for postcombustion carbon capture has been the chemical scrubbing 
53 
technology with CO2selective aqueous systems using basic amines. Amine scrubbing has been commercially 
54 
available for decades and has been widely applied in industrial settings such as petrochemical plants, biogas 
55 
plants, and refineries for carbon capture.
