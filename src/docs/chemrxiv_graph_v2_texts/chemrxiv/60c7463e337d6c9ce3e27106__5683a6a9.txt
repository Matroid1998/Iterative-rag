Description:
A product of the reduction of CO2 by molecular electrocatalysts.

The steadily increasing market share of electricity from renewable sources continues 
to generate interest in developing electrochemical transformations for storing energy in 
chemical bonds.1 One compelling approach is to direct energy from these sources towards 
electrochemical transformations of CO2, a byproduct of fossil fuel usage and a greenhouse 
gas, into useful fuel precursors and commodity chemicals.1, 2 In comparison to molecular 
electrocatalysts developed for the reduction of CO2 to CO, relatively few catalysts have 
been developed which selectively produce formate.35 Formate is currently utilized as an 
organic hydride source,6 directly in a fuel cells,7 and as a H2 storage material.8 
Previously, we identified a molecular Fe(III) chloride complex based upon 6,6di(3,5di
tertbutyl2hydroxybenzene)2,2bipyridine 
(Fe(tbudhbpy)Cl,

which 
produced formate (HCO2) with a FE of 684 from CO2 in the presence of 0.5 M phenol 
(PhOH) with an Ecat2 of 2.45 V vs FcFc.9 Mechanistic studies suggested that a non
catalytic electrochemical reaction was vital to the observed reactivity the Febound 
oxygen atoms underwent protonation upon the Fe(III)(II) reduction, a type of multisite 
electron and proton transfer (MSEPT) reaction.912 MSEPT mechanisms involving ligand 
protonation upon metal redox changes in the primary coordination sphere are generally 
invoked for metal oxime and dithiolene complexes which catalytically generate hydrogen 
(H2)1317; similar mechanisms are underdeveloped for other substrates.3 MSEPT has been 
explored broadly in photochemical and chemical systems, including the photosynthetic 
oxidation of tyrosineZ,18 rutheniumbased model compounds for phenol oxidation,19 and

mixed TEMPOHorganic basechemical oxidant systems.20 Under electrochemical 
conditions, MSEPT has also been studied as an oxidant for tyrosine by M(bpy)332 
systems (M  Os, Ru, Fe, bpy  2,2bipyridine).21
