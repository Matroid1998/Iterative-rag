The key requirements include the strong correlation in openshell electrons and the dy
namic correlation especially in chargetransfer states such as metaltoligandligandtometal
charge transfer (MLCTLMCT) states. In addition, obtaining spin eigenstates is essential
for accurately modeling the intersystem crossing. To date, various computational methods have been developed to account for strong and
dynamic correlation in a balanced way. A widely adopted approach is the multireference
perturbation theory (MRPT) and its variants,79 . This method utilizes a multiconfiguration
(e.g. complete active space, CAS) reference state to address strong correlation, and typically
includes a secondorder perturbative correction (MRPT2) for dynamic correlation. The com
putational complexity of MRPT2 scales as O(N 5) with the basisset size of N, making it
valuable for investigating the electronic structures of transition metal complexes.
