Description:
A unit added to branches of a core pentasaccharide, affecting its conformation.

Text:
It was shown that the addition of one glucosyl unit to each 
of the (14) and (12) branches of this core pentasaccharide led to a significant change in 
conformation, into a more folded compact structure,4 with significant potential implications for 
the minimum epitope to target in vaccine design. In another recent study, Blaum et al.5 examined the pentasaccharide glycan component of 
ganglioside GM1, a membranebound ligand for a range of proteins, including those of viruses 
and bacteria. In their work, they identified an alternative conformation of GM1, exhibited in its 
complex with a 155 kDa protein, Factor H. Subsequent long time scale MD simulations (10 s) 
of GM1 in explicit solvent identified this structure as a secondary lowlying minimum on the 
free energy surface.
