Description:
An inert gas used as a drying gas in spray drying techniques.

Text:
One such technique, combining the 
characteristics of spray drying and freeze drying, is spray freezedrying.6 

Involving the atomization of a liquid to create microparticles that following quick 
solvent evaporation are separated from the drying gas (usually air or inert nitrogen) 
by means of a cyclone that deposes them in a glass collector situated in the bottom 
of the device, the spray drying technique has emerged as a less expensive and faster 
drying technique.7 The main problem of the spray drying technique, now used in 
alternative to freeze drying whenever possible, lies in the often low yields (2070) of 
isolated product.6 

The present work compares grapefruit IntegroPectin powders obtained via spray 
drying and via freezedrying in terms of phenolic content, quantification of the most

representative flavonoids, radical scavenging activity, total protein content, and pH 
of the resulting aqueous solutions.
