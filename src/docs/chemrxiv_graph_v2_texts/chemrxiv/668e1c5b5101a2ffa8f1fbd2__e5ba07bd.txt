Description:
A catalyst with high selectivity for CO2 electroreduction towards C2 compounds and low selectivity towards hydrogen evolution.

Text:
In contrast with conventional commercial methods, 
43 
such as CO2 hydrogenation or the FisherTropsch processes, CO2 ER can be conducted under ambient 
44 
temperatures and pressures using modular, scalable and decentralized units14. Copperbased catalysts are 
45 
the most selective materials known to unlock CO2 ER towards C2 compounds, such as ethanol and 
46 
ethylene10,1517 and other multicarbon hydrocarbons. And compared to other metal catalysts, copper 
47 
exhibits a relatively lower selectivity towards hydrogen evolution, leading to unmatched Faradaic 
48 
efficiencies for CO2 ER18. 49 
In the last two decades, numerous studies1921 attempted to optimize the catalytic activity, the energy 
50 
efficiency, and the selectivity of copper.

Description:
Used in electrocatalysts with poor stability and rapid degradation under CO2 electroreduction.

Text:
However, the stability of copper electrocatalysts is very poor  at 
51 
most in the range of hundreds of hours  which is orders of magnitude lower than the timescales of 
52 
industrial significance for comparative catalyst technologies, which exceeds 30 000 h20. Studies have 
53 
recently highlighted that this critical issue remains unresolved to date20. 54 
The rapid degradation of copperbased cathodic catalysts under CO2 ER affects their activity, selectivity 
55 
and overall performance22. The selectivity towards CO2reduced products lowers over time and hydrogen
