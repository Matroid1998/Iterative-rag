Description:
A gas with adsorption performance influenced by gravimetric and volumetric factors in MOFs.

At the same time, the main challenge to improve volumetric H2 
45 
storage capacity is maximizing density as well as gas uptake.5, 24 Indeed, while many studies have 
46 
previously focused on MOFs with high gravimetric BET areas and pore volumes, the high gravimetric 
47 
H2 adsorption capacities did not readily translate to high volumetric H2 adsorption performance due 
48 
to the low framework densities of these materials.25 Recently, the development of MOFs for H2 
49 
storage has focused on materials which balance gravimetric and volumetric adsorption performance, 
50 
whereby MOFs combining optimal pore volumes and structural density give way to materials with 
51 
exceptional volumetric BET areas.8, 11, 26, 27 While many of these MOFs display exceptional H2 
52 
adsorption performance, they often contain complex organic linker ligands andor complex synthesis 
53 
procedures.11 As such, accessing interpenetrated analogues of archetypal MOF systems represents a 
54 
potentially straightforward route to materials with increased volumetric capacities, facilitated by the 
55 
increase in MOF structural density and simultaneously enhanced adsorbateadsorbent interactions.28
