 V  () (1) 
kRISC is largely dependent on the magnitude of the SOC (V), which is proportional to the atomic 
nuclear charge 
 of the atoms involved in the emissive transition. Previous works have shown that 
introducing heavy atoms such as bromine,9 iodine,10 sulfur,11 and selenium12 can induce a large 
SOC in MRTADF molecules, thereby accelerating kRISC to greater than 105 s1, and leading to an 
improve exciton utilization in the device.1a 
The benzothienocarbazole (BTC) regioisomeric moieties, with their moderately heavy S atom (ZN 16), 
rigid skeleton, and moderately strong electrondonating strength,13 have been used in DA TADF 
emitter design.

Description:
The location of the sulfur atom affects the SOC between low-lying triplet and singlet excited states, impacting excitonic kinetics.

Both Cai et al.14 and Shin et al.15 have shown that the location of the sulfur atom 
affects the SOC between lowlying triplet and singlet excited states, impacting excitonic kinetics. The 
emitters BTCZPZ2 and BTCZPZ1, containing different regioisomeric 12Hbenzo4,5thieno 2,3
acarbazol (BT2) and 5Hbenzo4,5thieno3,2ccarbazole (BT1) donors (Figure 1), respectively, 
showed blue emission at PL of ca. 470 nm as 10 wt doped films in 2,8bis(diphenylphosphoryl)
dibenzob,dthiophene (PPT).14 TDDFT calculations predicted larger SOC matrix element (SOCME)
