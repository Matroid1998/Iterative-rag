Fluorinated bioactive small molecules have a remarkable role in modern medicinal 
50 
chemistry, as the incorporation of fluorine into drug candidates enhances their bioavailablility, 
51 
metabolic stability, binding affinity to target proteins, and provides a variety of beneficial 
52 
pharmacological properties14. One such compound is 5fluorouracil (5FU), a fluoropyrimidine 
53 
antimetabolite commonly used to treat colorectal cancer. A lipophilicmasked analog of 5FU, 
54 
carmofur, was developed as an antineoplastic agent which covalently inhibits acid ceramidase, 
55 
leading to ceramidaseinduced apoptosis58. Through recent drug repurposing efforts, carmofur 
56 
has been identified as a potent covalent inhibitor of SARSCoV2 main protease (Mpro) activity, 
57 
suggesting carmofur might be a novel antiviral lead for SARSCoV2 911 (Fig. 1b).

Description:
Has limited solubility in most organic solvents, requiring exceptionally polar, nonvolatile solvents for reactions.

Carmofur and its analogs have been previously synthesized from 5fluorouracil with phosgene 
60 
and hexylamine in pyridine, or through direct nucleophilic addition of 5fluorouracil to nhexyl 
61 
isocyanate in pyridine12,13 (Fig. 2). However, previously recorded synthetic procedures have 
62 
suffered from low yields and inefficient reaction times5,6. Additionally, due to the limited 
63 
solubility of 5fluorouracil in most organic solvents, this reaction must be performed in 
64 
exceptionally polar, nonvolatile solvents such as pyridine, making it inconvenient to monitor by 
65 
thinlayer chromatography14. Serendipitously, carmofurs fluorine atom serves as a spectroscopic 
66 
handle for reaction monitoring by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
