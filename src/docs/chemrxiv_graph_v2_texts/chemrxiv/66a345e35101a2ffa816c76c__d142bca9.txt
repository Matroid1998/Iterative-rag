Description:
Evaluated for particle shape and spatial resolution of polymorphs using X-ray CT.

Text:
Interesting work evaluating the particle shape and how that can be utilized in Xray
CT to spatially resolve polymorphs in a sample has been conducted and shown to 99 accuracy for 
clopidogrel bisulphate in a Plasdone S630 (Nvinyl2pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate) capsule.16 Several 
studies have explored the use of XrayCT to evaluate the impact of typical processes such as 
compaction17 and dissolution.1821 Specific to this paper, Fu et al. used glass beads as tracers to 
evaluate the way in which a powder was compressed in a tablet die with force applied from a single 
direction.
