In the everevolving field of biomedical engineering, the quest for sustainable 
materials that are both environmentally friendly and functionally versatile has never 
been more imperative. Traditional polymers often rely on petroleumderived 
compounds, which not only contribute to environmental pollution but also raise 
concerns regarding their biocompatibility in biomedical applications 1,2. In this context, 2,5furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) emerges as a promising 
candidate with its unique potential derived from natural resources, offering an 
alternative to petrochemical monomers 3,4. FDCA is a carbohydrate compound 
within the furfural group, derived from polysaccharides, starch, or lignocellulose. Its 
chemical structure bears resemblance to terephthalic acid (TPA), the primary 
petrochemical monomer for the synthesis of semicrystalline aromatic polyesters like 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) or poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) 58.
