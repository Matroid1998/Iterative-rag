Description:
Found in high concentrations in rice bran.

The development of innovative, highperformance polymer materials requires monomers with unique 
functional groups that can promote their facile and effective polymerization. The use of functional 
phenolic styrene derivatives as polymer precursors has gained considerable attention because they can 
provide access to novel polymers with varied properties based on their functional groups.15 In addition, 
they derive from naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acids 1 and are thus potentially renewable building 
blocks for polymers and materials.6 These acids are natural phenolic compounds that can be found in 
almost every plant. High concentrations of pcoumaric (1a), caffeic (1b), ferulic (1c) and sinapic acid 
(1d) can be found in berries,7 coffee,8 rice bran,9 and oilseed crops,10 respectively.
