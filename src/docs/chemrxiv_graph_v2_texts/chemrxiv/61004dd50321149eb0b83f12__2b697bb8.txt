Orthosilicic acid is the most fundamental building block of dissolved silica, which are 
21 
themselves among the most ubiquitous classes of compounds found in surface waters. A 
22 
thorough understanding of the chemistry of orthosilicic acid is therefore vital to elucidate 
23 
phenomena involving silica such as mineralization, nutrient bioavailability, and geothermal well
