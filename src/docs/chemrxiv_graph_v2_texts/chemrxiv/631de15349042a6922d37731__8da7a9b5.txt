Description:
Has a potential difference of 2.7 V and contributes to a theoretical energy density of 1922 Wh kg1.

High energy density batteries are needed to meet ever expanding energy demands. Li metal 
batteries (LMBs) containing conversion cathode materials are a promising route for achieving 
this goal due to large working voltages,1, 2 multielectron reactions,1, 2 and the exceptional 
theoretical capacity of Li metal (3860 mAh g1).3, 4 For example, the threeelectron reaction 
that FeF3 undergoes with Li,1 paired with a 2.7 V LiFeF3 potential difference,2 confers a 
theoretical energy density of 1922 Wh kg1.1 High energy density, along with environmental

benignity and rich natural abundance, has spurred interest in FeF3 as an LMB cathode 
material.1, 2, 57
