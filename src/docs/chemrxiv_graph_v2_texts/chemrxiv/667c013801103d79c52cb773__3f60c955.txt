Description:
Metastable and kinetically stable up to temperatures of about 700 K.

At the same time, stabilization of the nonequilibrium 
rock salt phase of zinc oxide at ambient pressure can be achieved in simpler binary 69 or ternary 
911 oxide systems in a wide range of compositions, making them potentially interesting for 
practical applications. Moreover, in this case the stabilization is of a kinetic nature, i.e. the reverse 
rstow phase transformation is kinetically hindered due to a variety of reasons, including in 
particular the chemical pressure imposed by the multicharged cation in solid solutions of the 
(1x)Lin2MenOn1  xZnO type 911. It has been shown previously that metastable rsFe1xZnxO (x  0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3) are kinetically 
stable up to temperatures of about 700 K 8.
