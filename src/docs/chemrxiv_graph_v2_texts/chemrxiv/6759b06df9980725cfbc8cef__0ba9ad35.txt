Description:
A greenhouse gas accounting for over 60% of the global warming effect.

The average global temperature has been steadily rising since the late 19th century and was c.a. 1.2 
Celsius degree warmer in 2023 than the preindustrial average.1 This warming is largely driven by 
greenhouse gas emissions, with CO accounting for over 60  of the effect.2 Amongst various strategies 
to manage CO2 emission levels, direct air capture (DAC) offers a solution by capturing CO2 directly from 
ambient air.3,4 This process is challenging due to trace amounts of CO2 concentration (around 400 ppm) 
and low selective capturing of CO2 over atmospheric water vapor.
