Description:
An endogenously formed compound that serves as a high-affinity ligand for the transcription factor Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR).

Text:
Indolocarbazoles are highly valued functional scaffolds with extensive applications in biology and material sciences 
1. Illustrating examples are indolo3,2bcarbazole and 6formylindolo3,2bcarbazole (FICZ). They are 
endogenously formed within human tissues and serve as highaffinity ligands for the transcription factor Aryl 
hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) (Figure 1A) 2. AhR is a key regulator in xenobiotic metabolism and immunity, playing 
a fundamental role in several pathophysiological processes. Accordingly, manipulating AhR activity is considered 
as a promising therapeutic strategy for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, 
cancer, and viral infections 3. However, to date, the bacterial metabolite tapinarof is the only FDAapproved AhR 
ligand for the application in humans (psoriasis treatment, 2022) 4. AhRbased drug discovery faces several 
challenges.

Description:
A 6formyl derivative that displays highly potent and selective activity but is phototoxic and lacks proper druglike characteristics.

In this context, 
the 6substituted indolo3,2bcarbazole scaffold was chosen as the synthetic target to build novel relevant AhR 
ligands (Figure 1B). In this regard, the 6formyl derivative (FICZ) displays highly potent and selective activity, but 
suffers from a long synthetic access 7 with limited options for chemical diversification. Furthermore, FICZ is 
phototoxic, lacks proper druglike characteristics due to its CHO group, and its therapeutic projection is unsuitable 
despite being the most used AhR probe. In general, although the preparation of symmetric 6,12disubstituted 
indolocarbazoles has been thoroughly studied 1, the reliable synthetic access to 6substituted indolocarbazoles
