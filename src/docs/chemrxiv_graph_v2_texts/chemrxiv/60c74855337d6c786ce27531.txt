Description:
A component of proteases involved in viral replication, such as papainlike and chymotrypsinlike proteases.

Text:
In the case of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, the two proteases are a papainlike cysteine 
protease (PLpro)12 and a chymotrypsinlike cysteine protease 3CLpro,13 also known as the Main 
protease. SARSCoV 3CLpro is essential for viral replication and is thus recognized as a 
potential drug target for the treatment of SARS infections. To date there are no clinically 
used inhibitors of the SARS protease yet they remain in development.14
