Description:
Undergoes oxidative coupling to form corrole and isocorrole.

Text:
While revisiting our recent nearinstantaneous synthesis of isocorroles27 
via the DDQmediated oxidative coupling28,29,30,31 of pyrrole to corrole, we noticed a red fraction 
remaining on the column after columnchromatographic isolation of the isocorrole. Mass spectrometry 
indicated a molecular formula consistent with corrole  2pyrrole  2H, suggesting oxidative addition of a 
second molecule of pyrrole to the initially formed pyrroleappended isocorrole, a surmise that 1H NMR 
spectroscopy would later confirm. We named the new product calixcorrole by analogy with calixphyrin.
