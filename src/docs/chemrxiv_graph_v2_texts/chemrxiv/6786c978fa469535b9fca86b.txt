Description:
Produced as a green byproduct during LiOH production via water-splitting reaction.

It also generates a 
significant chemical byproductwaste which undermines the sustainability of the overall battery 
manufacturing process.5 
Electrodialysis has recently been proposed as an alternative green technology to convert leachate 
produced from ores, Lirich brines, or even existing highpurity Li2CO3 products into LiOH battery 
precursors.6 Electrodialysis uses ion exchange membranes that enable the selective transport of ions 
based on their charge and size, and is a wellestablished method used in water desalination for the 
separation of metallic cations and their accompanying anions.7 In the specific case of Li salts, selective 
separation in a costeffective and environmentally sustainable manner has been reported.6,810 
Furthermore, electrodialysis can produce green hydrogen as a result of the watersplitting reaction 
that occurs during LiOH production.
