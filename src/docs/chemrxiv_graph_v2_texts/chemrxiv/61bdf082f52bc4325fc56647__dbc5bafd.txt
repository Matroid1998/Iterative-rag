Description:
The next member in the homologous series CnH2n1CONH2, recently detected in space.

The interstellar presence of molecules with a peptide moiety, C(O)NH, is suggestive
of an extraterrestrial origin for life on Earth.1 Acetamide, H3CC(O)NH2, is not only one
of the most abundant organic molecules present in the neighbourhood of Sagittarius B22,3
but has also been found in comets.4 It has been postulated to be the key precursor to more
complex organic species although there are currently no obvious routes that would explain its
formation in the gasphase.5,6 The very recent detection of propionamide, C2H5CONH2, the
next member in the homologous series, CnH2n1CONH2, suggests that peptidelike molecules
might be widespread in space;7 however, Kolesnikova et al.
