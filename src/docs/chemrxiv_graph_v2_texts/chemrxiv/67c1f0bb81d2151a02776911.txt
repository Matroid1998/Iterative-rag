Nanoindentation is a microscale contact mechanics method that uses a hard indenter probe tip 
with known and wellcharacterized mechanical properties (often made of diamond) to deform a 
sample surface of unknown properties.24,25 It has gained popularity in the last two decades for 
characterizing mechanical properties at the microscale for rigid materials2628, but also for soft 
and biological samples, due to its ability to measure samples with limited dimensions and its 
sensitivity to sample anisotropy and inhomogeneity.23 In their tutorial review article, Pruitt and 
coworkers provide guidelines on performing nanoindentation measurements for soft materials 
and suggest the use of a conospherical tip, displacementcontrolled method and a modied 
trapezoidal function to probe compliant, adhesive materials.29 This approach was validated by 
Gallant and coworkers for macroscale polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) samples.3032 
However, as of today, there are only few reports on the characterization of mechanical properties 
of microscale 3D printed soft elastomers using nanoindentation, with a lack of clear 
methodology.

Text:
Accardo and coworkers studied mechanical properties of 3D printed PDMS 
microstructures (IPPDMS, Nanoscribe GmbH  Co. KG) using nanoindentation with a 
conospherical tip. By varying the printing parameters, a wide range of stiffness varying between 
0.3517.8 MPa was reported, although adhesion effects were not taken into consideration.33 The
