Description:
A material for which empirical scaling factors were introduced to improve predictions of adsorption isotherms.

Text:
12 introduced empirical scaling factors of 0.69 for UFF
and 0.95 for UFF in the UFF force field to improve the predictions of the adsorption
isotherms in ZIF8 and showed that these parameters could be transferred to ZIF76. McDaniel et al. 15 argued that different scaling parameters could give similar results,
hence questioning its transferability. McDaniel et al. 15 developed a framework to de
rive a specific force field for each ZIF using ab initio calculations and showed that
accurate predictions of the adsorption isotherms could be made for ZIF8 and ZIF71.
