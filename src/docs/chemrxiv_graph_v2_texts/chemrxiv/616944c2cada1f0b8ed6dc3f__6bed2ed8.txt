Description:
A complex with g42TTT involving double doping.

Text:
While our approach includes the possibil
ity for other electronic processes to occur,21 the results
clearly show double ptype doping in the form of a dou
ble integer charge transfer from the conjugated chains
onto the dopant molecule a CN6CP dianion is formed
along with two individual singly charged polarons, one
on each polymer chain. The vibrational IR spectrum
we calculate for the CN6CP2p(g42TTT) complex with
double doping can clearly be traced back to those of in
dividual polarons and a CN6CP dianion.
