Reacts with transition metal complexes supported by Lewis-acidic ligands under thermal conditions.

In the past few years there has been growing interest in using heterometallic complexes for H2 
activation. Transition metal complexes supported by Lewisacidic B,13 Mg,4,5 Al,6 Zn,7,8 and 
Sn9,10 ligands have all been documented to react with H2 under thermal conditions. Despite the 
rapid growth of this area, examples of photolytic H2 splitting using these types of 
heterometallic complexes are rare. To the best of our knowledge, photolytic reactivity is 
limited to a single example involving the addition of H2 to a RuZn heterometallic complex.11 

These findings contrast the rich chemistry of singlesite transition metal complexes, where 
examples of photochemical H2 activation are more common.
