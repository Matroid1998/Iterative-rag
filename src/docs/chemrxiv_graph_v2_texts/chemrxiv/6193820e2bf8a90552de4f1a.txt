Description:
A divalent or trivalent transition metal atom.

Text:
The general formula of this series of materials is
A2M2DO6, A3M2DO6 or A4MDO6, where M can be
divalent or trivalent transition metal atoms such as Cr,
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or some combination thereof; D rep

resents pentavalent or hexavalent metal atoms such as
Sb, Te, or Bi; and A can be alkali metal atoms such as
Li, Na, or K 15, 28. The structure in general consists of
an array of parallel transition metal slabs with a distinct
honeycomb arrangement of multiple M atoms surround
ing D atoms in a layered framework of interposed A alkali
atoms. Specically, the tellurates in honeycomb layered
oxides have been reported to produce the highest voltages
(over 4V) to date 1618, 2023, 26.
