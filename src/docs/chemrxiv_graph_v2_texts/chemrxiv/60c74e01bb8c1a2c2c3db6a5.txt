Description:
A layered low-dimensional nanomaterial composed of phosphorous atoms with a puckered hexagonal structure.

Text:
Phosphorene is a layered lowdimensional nanomaterial composed of phosphorous atoms 
via strong PP covalent bonds and weak interlayer Van der Waals forces that resembles a puckered 
hexagonal structure that is different of the flattened structure of graphene1. This structure has 
been successfully isolated employing liquidphase exfoliation and mechanical cleavage of black 
phosphorus24, and it shows interesting properties such as experimental stability, sizable direct 
bandgap (1.5 eV for monolayer phosphorene), and high electron mobility at room temperature (up 
to 1000 cm2V1s1)5. The study of phosphorenebased materials is an increasing field of research, 
focusing on their applications in nanoelectronics devices, energy storage and solar cells, field
effect transistors, photocatalysis, optoelectronics, and photovoltaic devices510.

phosphorene have also been proposed as potential nextgeneration materials for spintronics, 
photoelectronic and optical devices, catalysis, storage, pollutant, removal, and gas sensing1134. The introduction of impurities or dopants allows the tailoring of the phosphorene properties, where 
dopants can be experimentally introduced as in related lowdimensional nanomaterials, this is by 
chemical modification, intercalation, lowenergy ion implantation, and defectassisted doping by
