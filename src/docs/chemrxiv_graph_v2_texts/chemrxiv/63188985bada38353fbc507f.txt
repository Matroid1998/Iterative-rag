Description:
Peptides derived from bacteria and mitochondria recognized by formyl peptide receptors.

Text:
Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) 13 are class A GPCRs that play critical roles in host defence against 
infection and in inflammation.1 They recognise a highly diverse range of endogenous ligands, 
including bacteria, virus and hostderived peptides, and lipid mediators.2 FPR1 is expressed on the 
surface of leukocytes, where its canonical role is in the regulation of immune responses through 
recognition of microbe and damageassociated molecular patterns such as Nformyl methionine 
peptides derived from bacteria and mitochondria.1, 3 FPR1 has also been reported to be expressed in 
many different cell types, including a variety of epithelial and cancer cells.2 In some cases, evidence 
for the presence of FPR1 is through transcript detection or immunostaining, and biological relevance 
or role in these noncanonical settings is often unclear.
