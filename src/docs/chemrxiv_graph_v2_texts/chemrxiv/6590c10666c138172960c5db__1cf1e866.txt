The study of per and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) pollutants has been extended from 
28 
the early focus on allcarbon perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs, CnF2n1COO) and perfluoroalkane 
29 
sulfonates (PFSAs, CnF2n1SO3) to a large variety of novel structures with various heteroatoms, 
30 
branching patterns, and chain lengths.13 For example, many fluorinated ether structures have been 
31 
detected in water and soil worldwide47 and shown various toxicities.813 The belated attention to 
32 
these structures is primarily attributed to (1) the information gap between fluorine chemistry and 
33 
environmental chemistry and (2) the lack of analytical standards for targeted analysis.14 
34 
For the detection of telomer (CnF2n1(CH2)mX, Xhighly diverse organic functional 
35 
groups) and sulfonamide (CnF2n1SO2NHX) surfactants, total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay 
36 
has been widely applied.14 The H atoms in the precursor molecules allow oxidation by hydroxyl 
37 
radicals (HO, generated from persulfate at pH12 at 85), yielding one or multiple PFCAs for 
38 
targeted analysis.15, 16 Our lab further modified the reaction condition (e.g., NaOHK2S2O851 
39 
and 120 ), extended the substrate scope (e.g., CnF2n1(CH2)2COO, CnF2n1(CH2)2SO3, 
40 
and HCnF2nCOO with variable n), and quantified shortchain products (e.g., CF3COO, 
41 
C2F5COO, and OOCCF2COO).17, 18 Notably, structures with only one CH bond in HCF2 
42 
and multiple CH bonds in (CH2)2 showed distinct transformation patterns.18 A previous TOP 
43 
assay of various fluoro ether structures by Zhang et al.19 found that only Hcontaining structures 
44 
could be converted by HO, but the product information remained largely unknown.20 
45 
The above findings reflect several limitations (but not necessarily disadvantages) of the 
46 
current TOP assay.
