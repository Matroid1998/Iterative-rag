Description:
Subjected to femtosecond strong-field laser pulses to induce dynamics.

Text:
The ultrafast pump
probe studies with ultrashort XUV pulses produced either by high
harmonic generation (HHG) sources1316 or freeelectron lasers
(FELs)1719 revealed rich dynamics of charge state evolutions up
to PAH trications. Femtosecond strongfield laser pulses, produced
by TiSa lasers, were also used to induce dynamics in benzene and
toluene.20,21 These studies found interesting dynamics, such as
