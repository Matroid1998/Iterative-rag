Description:
An initial hit for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) developed into a macrocyclic series.

This method requires little to no prior knowledge
about the target or specific interactions other than experi
mental density maps, representing an accessible and target
agnostic approach to improve diverse docking applications. Results

derived guidance by reproducing experimental ligand poses
(i.e. redocking and crossdocking) using AutoDockGPU7. To evaluate this, we selected three targets with multiple
ligand cocomplexes from the same set of experiments
one determined with xray crystallography and two with
cryoEM. The Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) was
selected as the xray crystallography target. The initial
hit Crizotinib (PF2341066)8 was further developed into a
macrocyclic series containing Lorlatinib (PF06463922)9,10,
for which several cocrystal structures were determined.
