Description:
Enhances methanol selectivity in Cu-based materials.

Text:
In Cubased materials, Zn is wellknown to greatly enhance methanol selectivity.10, 11 Other 
13 
reducible elements, in particular Ga, have also been shown to enhance methanol selectivity of Cu
14 
based catalysts.1214 Additionally, Ga is able to switch the general reaction outcome.
