Description:
Used as a charge carrier in sodium ion batteries, more abundant and cost-effective than lithium.

Text:
Among such options, the use of sodium (Na) ions as the charge carrier is one of the most
promising alternatives sodium is orders of magnitude more abundant on the Earths crust,
and its mining is more costeective than lithium.17 Additionally, the cathodes of sodium
ion batteries (NIBs) can be synthesized with manganese (Mn) or iron (Fe), while stable LIB
cathodes require cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni), elements which are rarer and have higher supply
risks.1719 While Nametal simply cannot rival the energy density of corresponding Limetal
batteries, it still exceeds that of Liion by a factor of three (for sulfurbased systems).20
Furthermore, since both Li and Na are alkali metals, they have very similar electrochemical
properties20 production lines of LIBs can be easily adapted to NIBs, and many of the strides
