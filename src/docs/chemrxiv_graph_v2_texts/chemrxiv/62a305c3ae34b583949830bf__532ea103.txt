Description:
A small molecule with a high NH bond dissociation free energy of 100.3 kcal/mol.

Text:
Ammonia (NH3) and water (H2O) are ubiquitous small mole
cules that represent one of the pillars from which life on Earth 
sustains.1 Due to their widespread presence, they have been 
identified as energy units or economic building blocks en route 
to highvalue compounds.2 However, their chemical manipula
tion is nontrivial, as a result of the high bond dissociation free 
energy (BDFE) of their NH and OH bonds (BDFEOH in H2O 
 113.0 kcalmol1; BDFENH in NH3  100.3 kcalmol1).3 In
deed, the majority of the approaches towards XH cleavage fo
cus on polar pathways; for example, both d and pblock ele
ments undergo oxidative addition4 or deprotonation through 
metalligand cooperation4c, 5 using the twoelectrons of the re
spective d and porbitals (Fig. 1A).
