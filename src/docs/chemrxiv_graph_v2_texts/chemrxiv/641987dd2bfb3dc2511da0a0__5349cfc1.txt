Description:
Contains trigonal C(sp2) double CC bonds.

Text:
In 3C and 2H diamond, as well as in the extended lattice polytypes, the valence 4 electrons (2s2, 2p2) 
arrange in tetrahedra with sp3like hybridization; note that this term, as well as other carbon 
hybridizations (sp2 and sp1), are common in organic chemistry, and less so in the solid state 
chemistry; nevertheless, they are useful for establishing the chemical description of the bonding and 
the resulting physical and chemical properties. For applications such as electronics, the physical properties of diamond can be modified by 
introducing trigonal C(sp2)  double CC bonds as in ethene  and linear C(sp1)  triple CC bonds as 
in acetylene  on the one hand, and by working on the particle size as in nanodiamonds, on the other 
hand.
