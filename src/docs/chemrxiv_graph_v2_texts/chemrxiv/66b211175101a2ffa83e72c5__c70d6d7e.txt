Description:
A sesquinitride transformed into B3N3 by additional boron atom insertion.

The present paper further develops the field of boron nitrides by proposing novel cohesive and 
stable hybrid BN phases. First, tetragonal and hexagonal sp3sp2 hybrid C5 allotropes were 
designed by crystal chemistry engineering and subsequently used as templates for the selective 
substitution of carbon for boron and nitrogen, leading to the sesquinitride B2N3, which was then 
transformed into the equiatomic B3N3 through the insertion of an additional boron atom into 
B2N3. Considering that boron nitride is admittedly equiatomic, our challenging prediction of boron 
sesquinitride is supported to some extent by the previously reported nitrogenexcess tetragonal 
B2N3 8, but no structural details were provided for this compound. The boron nitride B116N124 
fullerene should also be mentioned as nitrogenrich BN phase 9.
