Description:
Binary metal compounds containing both P-P bonds and metal-P bonds, often with semiconducting properties.

Text:
Phosphorus readily forms homoelement bonds in the
solid state. Accordingly, over a hundred phosphorusrich
binary metal phosphides containing both PP bonds and
metalP bonds have been synthesized in bulk form.1,2
Often, these compounds have semiconducting proper
ties and decompose into elemental phosphorus and a
metalrich phosphide (with only metalP bonds) at high
temperatures.2 Thinfilm synthesis of Prich materials
would help determine their technological potential and
their compatibility with established materials and pro
cesses. In addition, growing these materials in thinfilm
form would be desirable for highthroughput character
ization of their properties as a function of composition
and process conditions.
