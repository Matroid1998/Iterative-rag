Description:
Used as a precursor in the chemical vapor deposition of GaN thin films.

Text:
GaN thin films are typically deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at 800
1000 C using trimethylgallium, Ga(CH3)3 (TMG), and ammonia, NH3, as precursors.3 
The high deposition temperatures and poor conformity of the established CVD processes 
for GaN are problematic for any device structure not compatible with high temperatures or 
that require uniform film thickness over topographically complex geometries. The 
deposition method of choice for such structures is atomic layer deposition (ALD).
