Description:
Synthesized by Negishi coupling reaction.

However, difficulties in preparation 
the biferrocenebased deveriatives cleanly (seperation from the reactants) and in high yield 
has held back the development of these type of ligands. Optical active biferrocenes still 
remain as an underexplored structural motif for developing new chiral catalysts. In 2012, Weissensteiner reported a synthesized route to build an unsymmetrically 2,2
disubstituted biferrocenes by Negishi coupling reaction.10 Two nonidentical ferrocene 
fragments was coupled and finally furnished a 2,2substituted biferrocenesdiphosphine, 
which could form eightmembered chelate ring by complexation to a metal. However, this 
synthesis methodology required optical pure precursors and total seven steps were needed 
which gave a low total yield (only 6.4).
