Description:
Involved in the formation of nitrogen defects affecting photoconversion in diamond.

Text:
Laser light used to polarize and interrogate NV centers can also induce charge switching between 
NV and its neutral form NV0 27,4247. Photoconversion depends on the presence of nitrogen 
defects and surface acceptor states, and thus both NV  NV0 and NV0  NV photoconversion 
routes have been observed in different diamond samples. Recently, we have shown that 
increasing laser power can substantially increase the availability of shallow NV produced by
