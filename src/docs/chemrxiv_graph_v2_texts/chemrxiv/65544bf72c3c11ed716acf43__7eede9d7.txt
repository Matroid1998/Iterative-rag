Description:
Used as a template in the chemical vapor deposition of methane for synthesizing nanoporous graphene.

Text:
Nanoporous graphene (NPG) materials16 enjoy the high electro
chemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and flexibility of 
the continuous threedimensional (3D) graphene architecture, 
with high surface area and nanoporosity. NPGs are synthesized 
by (i) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane (CH4) using 
nanoparticles of nontransitionmetal oxides such as alumina 
(Al2O3)7 and MgO8 as the template, (ii) the subsequent acid 
etching for removing the metal oxides, and (iii) the annealing of 
the obtained nanoporous carbon (NPC) materials to give the 3D 
continuous architecture (Fig. 1).
