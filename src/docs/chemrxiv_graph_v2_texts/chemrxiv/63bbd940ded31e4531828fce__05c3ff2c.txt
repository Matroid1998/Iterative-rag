Description:
Can be part of the framework in sodium-filled Prussian blue analogues.

Text:
Naion batteries (NIBs) are a technological analogue to Liion batteries (LIBs) but with several 
competitive benefits,1 including economic benefits stemming from the low cost of sodium 
resources and the possibility of employing Al as the anode current collector and chemical 
benefits of the lower desolvation energy of Na in polar solvents and the better interfacial 
kinetics at the electrodeelectrolyte interface, compared with Li.24 The large size of Na poses 
a challenge for developing NIB cathodes that allow reversible Na intercalation and fast Na 
diffusion.5, 6 Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been explored as a family of NIB cathodes.7
9 The framework of Nafilled PBAs (NaPBAs), with a general formula NaxMFe(CN)61
yzH2O (0  x  2, 0  y  1, z  2, M  transition metal), has large interstitial sites to 
accommodate Na and directional channels for fast Na diffusion, as well as the structural 
openness to realize small lattice strain during repetitive Na intercalation.
