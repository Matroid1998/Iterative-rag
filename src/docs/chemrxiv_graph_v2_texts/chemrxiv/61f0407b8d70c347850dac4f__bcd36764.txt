Description:
Compounds such as azCA47 and redazCA48 are photoswitchable ligands for TRPV1.

The twentyeight Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) 
channels have crucial roles in sensing and integrating a 
wide range of stimuli.1 Betterknown members include 
TRPV1 (heat) and TRPM8 (cold) for which a 2021 Nobel 
Prize was awarded, and TRPA1 (electrophiles). As these 
channels are expressed in many tissues but play different 
biological roles in these tissues,2 potentially with time
dependent aspects, a range of photoswitchable ligands 
have been actively developed to elucidate their tissue and 
timespecific roles through spatiotemporally precise 
modulation.3 Notable photoswitchable TRP ligands 
include analogues of diacylglycerols (PhoDAGs)4,5 and of 
small polar GSK ligands6 for TRPC2,3,6; azovanilloids 
(azCA47, redazCA48) for TRPV1; and TRPswitch9 for 
TRPA1.
