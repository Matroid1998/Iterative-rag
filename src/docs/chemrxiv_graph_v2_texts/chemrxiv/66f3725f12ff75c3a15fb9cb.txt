Description:
Salts used to attach aryl rings as structural defects on nanotube surfaces, affecting hybridization and fluorescence properties.

Text:
In recent years, the majority of CCNT synthesis 
was performed using aryl diazonium salts to attach aryl 
rings as structural defects on the nanotube surface. For
mation of these defects results in a loss of sp2 hybridization 
at the defect site and formation of two sp3 centers. This al
ters the fluorescence properties of the nanotubes, including 
the formation of a new emission peak (referred to as E11, in 
contrast to the E11 emission peak of unmodified nanotubes). The choice of aryl group has a significant impact on the 
quantum well depth and environmental responsivity of the 
nanotubesfor example, incorporation of protonatable ani
line derivatives on the nanotube surface results in nano
tubes which respond to changes in pH.4
