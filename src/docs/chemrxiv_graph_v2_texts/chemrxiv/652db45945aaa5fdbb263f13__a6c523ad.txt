Description:
The triple bond CC stretch is used as a Raman tag in biomolecular and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies.

Recent work on the solvation of CO2 in ionic liquids 
exemplifies this; here, the CO2 was the probe of its own solvation dynamics.2325 
The triple bond CC stretch of alkynes has long been used as a Raman tag in biomolecular 
and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy studies.2632 This vibration appears in the 
biomolecular Raman window, a portion of the spectrum where biomolecular systems rarely 
produce Raman scattering.9,3335 In the prior tagging studies, the alkyne vibration was used mainly 
to show the presence of a material it was attached to.
