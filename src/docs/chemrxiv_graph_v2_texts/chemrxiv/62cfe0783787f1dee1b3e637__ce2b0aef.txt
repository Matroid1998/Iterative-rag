Description:
13C nuclei involved in polarization transfer in hydrogenative PHIP.

Text:
The major advantage of the transfer in high field is its experimental simplicity, as it does not require any 
field cycling equipment and is thus feasible on almost any modern NMR or MRI system, and substantial 
levels of heteronuclear polarization in high field have been reported 22, 23. However, low fields often prove 
more efficient for PHIP transfer 24, 27. This is partly due to lower polarization losses induced by singlet
triplet mixing at low magnetic fields when the two protons stemming from pH2 become chemically 
inequivalent in the reaction intermediates or in the product molecule 28, 29. Polarization transfer in 
hydrogenative PHIP generally implies the transfer from protons to 13C nuclei, in particular carbonyl 
carbons.
