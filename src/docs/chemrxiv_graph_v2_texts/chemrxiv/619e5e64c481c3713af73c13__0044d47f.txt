Description:
Increases the energy required for pyramidal inversion of nitrogen due to bonding constraints.

Text:
Aziridinium ylides are 
embedded in a highly strained ring, where the bonding constraints of the aziridine increase the 
energy required for pyramidal inversion of the nitrogen; often this rate is slow enough to measure 
using variable temperature (VT) or dynamic NMR spectroscopy.12ac The presence of two 
invertomers hinders the ability to selectively form and engage aziridinium ylides in secondary 
reactions and has limited their applications in the synthesis of complex Nheterocycles. For
