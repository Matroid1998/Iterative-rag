Description:
A chemical feedstock targeted for transformation and valorization due to environmental and economic reasons.

Text:
Owing to environmental and economic reasons, the transformation and valorization of abundant and 
readily available chemical feedstock such as CO and CO2 are very topical goals.1 Carbon monoxide is a C1 
gas that is used in the industrial production of organic feedstock molecules such as methanol2 and acetic 
acid.3 Synthesis gas (syngas COH2) is converted into liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates on industrial 
scales by using the FischerTropsch (FT) process.4 As the CO triple bond is one of the strongest chemical 
bonds (bond dissociation energy of 1075 kJ.mol1),5 this process typically operates under harsh 
temperature and pressure conditions (200350 C, 2045 bars) using heterogeneous transition metal 
catalysts (Fe, Co).6 The precise mechanism in the formation of FT products is still under debate and, to 
gain more insight into the elementary steps involved, several organometallic complexes have been used 
as soluble models.7 Similarly, recent advances in transitionmetalfree FT chemistry have been reported, 
describing formation of growing carbon chains.8 
Although CO homologation has been observed by the coupling between two or more fragments 
upon insertion of CO into metalalkyl,9 aryl,10 hydride,11 imide12 or boryl bonds,13 the direct reductive 
coupling of CO molecules has only been achieved by a very limited number of systems, typically involving 
lowvalent oxophilicmetallic or nonmetallicelements.14 For example, homogeneous p15, and dblock 
compounds16 have been used to promote CO reductive coupling.

Description:
A feedstock used in the formation of C1C4 chain compounds.

Text:
A similar intermediate was also recently 
suggested by Jones and coworkers in the reductive coupling of CO using activated bdiketiminate Mg(I) 
complexes (Figure 1).15e,15g However, in these studies, the reactivity of the CO oligomerization products 
was not further explored. Very recently, Crimmin and coworkers described the sequential formation of 
C1C4 chain compounds starting from CO and CO2 feedstocks in the presence of transition metal carbonyl 
complexes and using bdiketiminate Al(I) reductants.15c,15k Other systems allowing sequential chain growth 
by reductive homologation of CO from isolable intermediates are exceedingly rare,15a and, to the best of 
our knowledge, have not been used in further functionalization reactions.
