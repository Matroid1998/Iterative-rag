Description:
A lanthanide cation that can be excited to emit in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Text:
The lanthanide ion series has attractive 
luminescence properties, namely narrow emission bands, 
large Stokes shifts, long luminescence lifetime and 
resistance to photobleaching.4 Furthermore, the long 
lifetimes of the Ln(III) excited states lead to luminescence 
in the ms range, which can be exploited in combination with 
timegating methodologies to give low detection limits and 
also eliminate interfering cellular autofluorescence from 
biological molecules during bioimaging.5 Coordination 
complexes of lanthanide cations are found in many 
applications, particularly as cellular imaging agents and 
responsive bioprobes.6 They are highly tuneable, and 
Ln(III) cations may be excited so that they emit in the visible 
(e. g. LnEu, Tb) or nearinfrared (e. g. LnNd, Yb) regions 
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
