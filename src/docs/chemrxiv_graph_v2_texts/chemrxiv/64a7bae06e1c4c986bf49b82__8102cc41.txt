Description:
Used as a raw material for fuel cell applications and undergoes electrochemical oxidation with catalysts to overcome sluggish kinetics and high overpotential.

Text:
Methanol is an 
economical and readily available raw material, initially proposed by Professor George A. Olah 
for fuel cell applications9. Different electrode materials based on Pt10,11, Pd12 and Ptbinary 
electrodes13 were commonly used as catalysts to accelerate the activity and to overcome the 
sluggish kinetics and high overpotential for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. To
