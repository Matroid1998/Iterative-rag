Description:
A bond that can be displaced to facilitate interchange of reductions.

Text:
Binding induces also the displacement of the Cys43Cys 51 disulphide 
bond to the top cavity facilitating interchange of reductions of Cys132Cys135 and 
oxidized Vitamin K. After reduction, the top cavity opens up facilitating the 
exclusion of reactivated Vitamin K to continue with other carboxylation cycle. Actual anticoagulant rodenticides target VKORC1 by mimicking Vitamin K binding 
at similar bindingcavities and conformational changes. Most rat resistances to anticoagulants have been associated with 
genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) at the vkorc1 gene. Many of the mutations locate at the top of the rat VKORC1 central cavity 5,10,11,12 
(Figure 1A).
