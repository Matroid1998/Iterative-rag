Description:
A P2-type material able to deliver a high specific capacity at high operating voltage based on Ni redox.

Text:
In regard to Na conductivity, P2 is 
believed to be preferable over O3 as it offers open prismatic pathways with a lower energy barrier for Na diffusion, 
at least for a large portion of the x domain.6 P2type Na23Ni13Mn23O2 is considered a prototypical P2 material, 
able to deliver a high specific capacity at high operating voltage based theoretically on Niredox.79 With the redox 
couple of Ni24 and potentially O2n, a Nicontaining P2 material might also allow easy handling due to its relatively
