Description:
A metal component used in wires of electronic cigarettes.

Text:
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are popular batteryoperated devices that deliver nicotine 
and other chemicals to consumers 15. ECs have evolved from firstgeneration cigalikes, to 
second and third generation tank or modstyle ECs that include powerful batteries and large 
fluid reservoirs, to fourthgeneration podstyle ECs that are low power and sleek in design 2,6
9. All ECs have atomizers that contain metal components, such as the filaments (nickel, 
chromium), wires (copper, silver, nickel, tin, aluminum, iron, chromium), and wicks (silicon, 
calcium, aluminum, magnesium) 7,1012, and these elementsmetals can leach into the fluid 
and transfer to the aerosol 10,1319.

Description:
Present in eliquids and EC refill fluids.

Text:
Prior to use, eliquids (liquid in an EC) and EC refill fluids 
also contain selenium, tin, aluminum, calcium, silicon, manganese, chromium, and nickel 15 
and flavor chemicals (e.g., ethyl maltol, maltol, vanillin, cinnamaldehyde, diacetyl, 
benzaldehyde) 2023 that are often present in high concentrations 24. Nicotine concentrations in eliquids are quite variable 2527 and can be as high as 60 
mgmL in JUUL products 24. It has recently been appreciated that EC fluids also contain 
organic acids, such as benzoic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid 12,28, which form salts with 
nicotine making it more palatable to novice users 29. The aerosol inhaled during vaping is thus 
a complex mixture of these chemical groups plus reaction products that form during heating and 
are often known toxicants 3031.
