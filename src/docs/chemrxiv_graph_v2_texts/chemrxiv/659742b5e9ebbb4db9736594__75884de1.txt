Description:
A transition metal used in molecular water oxidation catalysts.

Text:
Regarding the most challenging halfreaction of the WS process, which is represented from the 
light induced water oxidation reaction, there are a few examples based on independent discrete 
molecules in homogeneous phase that have been described using invariably Ru(bpy)32 as light 
absorber in combination with a molecular water oxidation catalyst based on Ru and other 
transition metals.6,14 There are also examples of dyads , again based on Ru(bpy)32 analogues, 
where the absorber and the catalyst are linked together via covalent bonds that have mainly 
been showing to work as a proof of principle systems with limited quantum efficiencies.1518
