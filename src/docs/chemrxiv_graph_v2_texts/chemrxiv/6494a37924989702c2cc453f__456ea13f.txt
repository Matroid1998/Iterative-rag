Description:
Substrates frequently used to characterize plasma polymerisation deposition.

Text:
Moreover, the orientation and 
intermolecular packing of TEMPO molecules within 
plasma polymer films are expected to depend on the 
surface, so an understanding of growth and its impact on 
topography (Figure 1be), surface area, and chemistry are 
essential. TEMPO growth was investigated using SiO2, HOPG, 
and Au(111) as substrate materials. SiO2 substrates are 
frequently used to characterise plasma polymerisation 
deposition and are therefore used as a reference 
substrate. In comparison, Au(111) and HOPG are well
studied atomically flat materials known to promote good
