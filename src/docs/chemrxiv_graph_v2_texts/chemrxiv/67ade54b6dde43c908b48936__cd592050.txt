Description:
Used in a strain-release approach.

Text:
For instance, lengthy linear sequences were used to 
prepare the relatively simple avinyl azetidine,3e,f which is a highly versatile species (Scheme 1b).4 
Elegant catalytic methods based on the release of ring strain have been presented.5 Nprotected 
azetidines can be accessed from biodo ynamides.6 These approaches require however the presence 
of sacrificial groups. Higher atomeconomy has been achieved by few EnergyTransfer (EnT)7 
methods. A strainrelease approach uses 1.1.0azabicyclobutanes and a Nsulfonyl diarylimine.8 
An intermolecular 22 photocycloaddition combines a bcarboxy oxime with a styryl fragment.9 
Sensitized arylmethacrylamides can deliver blactams via hydrogenatomtransfer (HAT)10 to an 
alkyl radical.11
