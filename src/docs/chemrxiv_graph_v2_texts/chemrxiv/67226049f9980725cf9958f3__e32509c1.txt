Description:
Used in red and NIR emitters that suffer from low quantum yields due to nonradiative relaxation.

Text:
Nevertheless, a long
lasting PhOLED was manufactured exploiting pyrimidine
modification of the FIrPic emitter with skyblue max475
nm 16, whereas effective and relatively stable blue PhOLEDs
were created using triscyclometalated iridium(III) complexes
with Nheterocyclic carbene ligands 17,18. On the other
hand, red and NIR iridiumbased emitters suffer from low
quantum yields owing to nonradiative relaxation of the ex
cited state due to the energy gap law 19. Increasing the
rigidity of ligands 20, appropriate choice of substituents and
their positions 21 and incorporation of peripheral fragments
with large steric hindrance to eliminate unfavorable stack
ing interactions 22 may be effective to enhance the intensity
of lowenergy emission but all these design strategies have
limitations.

Description:
Used in phosphors and emitters with targeted emission characteristics.

Overall, the development of efficient iridium phosphors
requires significant cost and experimental efforts, while the
predictive power of stateoftheart density functional the
ory (DFT) calculations for heavy metal complexes still needs
to be substantially improved to enable rational design of
iridium emitters with targeted emission characteristics. In
turn, there is a very large body of experimental photophys
ical data that can be used for training machine learning
(ML) algorithms to develop a fast yet relatively accurate
tool for predicting the photophysical properties of iridium
complexes based solely on their molecular formula. Application of the ML methods in predicting various molec
ular properties has become extremely popular in recent years 23,24.
