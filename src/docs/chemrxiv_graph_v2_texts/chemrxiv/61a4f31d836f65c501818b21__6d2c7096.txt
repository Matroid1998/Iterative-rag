Used in industrial plants such as air separation units and chloralkali plants.

On the
other hand, if an eCO2R process is powered by grid electricity, one can adjust
the plant load to uctuations in electricity (spot) prices. This exible operation,
namely demand side management (DSM) or demand response (DR), leads to
savings in overall electricity costs 8. In academia, DSM has been applied to
various industrial plants, such as air separation units, chloralkali plants, and
aluminium plants 18. A major challenge of exible operation of eCO2R processes is that the com
position of the euent stream depends on the current density (or applied volt
