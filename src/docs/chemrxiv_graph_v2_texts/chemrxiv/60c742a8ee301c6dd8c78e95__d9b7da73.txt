Description:
A catalyst for work on other polytypes of BN.

Text:
Cubic BN (cBN) with sp3hybridization and diamond structure is the most well
known among BN phases. In 1957, Wentorf synthesized cBN from a mixture of boron 
and nitrogen at high temperature and pressures.1 The discovery of Borazon catalyzed 
work on the other polytypes of BN, foremost sp2hybridized hexagonal BN (hBN) 
white graphite and to some extent the less studied wurtzite form (wBN) that is similar 
to hexagonal diamond.
