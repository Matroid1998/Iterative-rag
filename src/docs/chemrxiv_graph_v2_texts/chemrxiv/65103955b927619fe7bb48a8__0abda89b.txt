Description:
Compounds used in the double reductive amination to synthesize disubstituted heterocycles.

Traditionally, this transformation has been per
formed using low temperature lithiation chemistry,9 but more 
modern methods have achieved it under preferable conditions 
by utilizing transition metal1012 and photoredox catalysis.13,14 
Although synthesis of disubstituted heterocycles has been 
achieved through the double reductive amination of diketone 
compounds,15 with key examples described in total and imino
sugar syntheses,16,17 no general asymmetric catalytic platform 
has yet been demonstrated. Instead, strategies that prioritise re
dox neutral cyclisation chemistry (i.e. PaalKnorr) followed by 
a global reduction are often preferred,18 despite the challenges 
in stereocontrol afforded by the simultaneous generation of 
multiple stereocentres. In recent years, biocatalysis has emerged as a robust platform 
for synthesis.
