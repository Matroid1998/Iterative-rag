Description:
A distorted bay annulated derivative used as a nonfullerene acceptor in organic solar cells.

Text:
Fujimoto and Izawa18 described a distorted bay Oannulated perylene diimide (PDI) 
derivative bearing sevenmembered rings which has been exploited as a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) in 
organic solar cells (OSCs). Recently, Zeng and coworkers19 reported the synthesis of an Odoped rylene 
diimide derivative showing efficient nearinfrared fluorescence. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023625fl ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000286891021 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
