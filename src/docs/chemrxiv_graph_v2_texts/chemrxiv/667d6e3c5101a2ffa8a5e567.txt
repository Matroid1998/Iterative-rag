Description:
Conventional porous materials known for their stability compared to MOFs.

Text:
The biggest advantage is that the high void space 
57 
allows the encapsulation of up to 50 times higher quantities of therapeutic agents per unit mass (up to 1.4 g 
58 
drug per g MOF), which are released over long timescales.18 The open structure of MOFs many times implies 
59 
relatively low stability compared to conventional porous materials such as zeolites and activated carbons but, 
60 
in drug delivery, it is beneficial as it will avoid bioaccumulation.
