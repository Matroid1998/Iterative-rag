Description:
Complex compounds used in coupling reactions to form quaternary centers.

Modern pharmacophore designs are testing the limits of known 
chemistry such that newly emerging radical crosscoupling tech
niques are seeing increasing attention in drug discovery.1 For exam
ple, the coupling of complex sp3hybridized tertiary carbons to (het
ero)arenes to generate quaternary centers was rarely, if ever, em
ployed a decade ago (Figure 1A).2 In this context, canonical 2e
crosscoupling techniques such as Suzuki3 and Kumada4,5 reactions 
suffer from low yields andor poor chemoselectivity in addition to 
arduous preparation of organometallic reagents making them unre
liable for modern medicinal chemistry campaigns.6,7 Crosselectro
phile type couplings are known in such contexts and due to their rad
ical nature are amongst the most useful for this purpose.811 That 
said, there is a large demand for new methods that can take readily 
available tertiary synthons and couple them directly to complex het
eroaryl halides.
