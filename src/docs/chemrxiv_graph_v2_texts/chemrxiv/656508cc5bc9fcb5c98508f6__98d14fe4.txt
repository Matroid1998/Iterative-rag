Description:
The product of the NozakiHiyamaKishi reaction involving alkenyl halides and aldehydes.

Text:
The NozakiHiyamaKishi (NHK) 
reaction, first discovered in 19777 and formalized in 19868 
usually involves the crosscoupling of an alkenyl halide with 
an aldehyde through the use of stoichiometric Cr and cata
lytic Ni to afford an allylic alcohol product.9 The correspond
ing alkylvariant of this reaction is seldom employed with a 
variety of alkyl nucleophile surrogates being disclosed over 
the years such as alkyl iodides,10 carboxylic acids via redox
active esters (RAEs),11 olefins,12 or even unactivated CH 
bonds13 (Figure 1B). Those variants, however, have not been 
employed in a catalytic, highly enantioselective fashion.
