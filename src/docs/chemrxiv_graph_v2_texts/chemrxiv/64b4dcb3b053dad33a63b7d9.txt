Description:
A compound that can be electrochemically reduced into valuable fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity.

Text:
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals using renewable 
electricity offers a promising approach to sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. In 
1985, Hori et al. discovered Cus unique catalytic activity in electrochemically reducing CO2 
to hydrocarbons.1 Later, in 2012, Kuhl et al. found that copper under CO2 reduction 
conditions could produce at least 16 different products including CO, C1, C2, and C3 
products.2 However, the nature of the formation of this extensive range of products has been a 
subject of intense debate. Unraveling this mystery is critical to the designing of a reaction 
system with superior efficiency and selectivity towards desired products.

Description:
Involves forming a CO2 anion via initial electron transfer in reduction processes.

Text:
Jordan and Smith suggested in 1960 that the initial step of CO2 reduction involves 
forming a CO2 anion via initial electron transfer.3 However, the standard potential for 
(CO2) formation is exceptionally highat1.90 V in an aqueous electrolyte.4 If Jordans 
proposal is correct, the potential for CO2 reduction to useful products must be 1.90 V or 
more negative. Yet, most products can be generated at comparatively lower potentials in a 
common aqueous electrolyte. For instance, Kuhl et al. discovered that 16 different products 
can be created at an applied potential of 1V in a 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous electrolyte.2 This 
finding suggests that the actual process of reducing CO2 into various valuable products may 
not necessitate the formation of (CO2). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20233z3gc ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000289600533 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.
