Description:
Has a lower boiling point compared to other similar molecules, possibly due to its smaller molecular weight.

Text:
It is experimentally known that the boiling point of trimethylamine 
is lower than that of the other two molecules. Readers with a background in chemistry may intuitively 
conclude that the lower boiling point of trimethylamine is due to its smaller molecular weight. However, for readers without a background in chemistry or AI algorithms, identifying the factors that 
determine boiling points from merely three data points would be challenging. One could posit that the
