Description:
Used in biomedical applications but have lower oxidative stability and biostability compared to polycarbonate urethanes.

Text:
Furthermore, recent reports in comparison of the biocompatibility of polyether urethanes and 
34 
polycarbonate urethanes showed that polycarbonate based urethanes have higher oxidative stability and biostability, 
35 
which makes them good alternative to replace with polyether urethanes for biomedical applications 34, 37. 36
