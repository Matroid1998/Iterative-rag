Description:
A presumptive prebiotic precursor of acetylCoA central to prebiotic carbon fixation.

Text:
Methanethiol was recently detected in CO2 and H2Srich fluid inclusions in 3.5Gyr
old hydrothermal precipitates with the carbon isotopic composition suggesting an abiotic origin (21). Methanethiol is a necessary ingredient for the synthesis of methyl thioacetate, a presumptive prebiotic 
precursor of acetylCoA central to prebiotic carbon fixation (22, 23). However, the availability of 
methanethiol in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems remains unresolved. Methanethiol has been 
detected in trace amounts in hydrothermal fluids from midocean ridge systems, but has been ascribed 
to thermal destruction of preexisting organic matter (24). Although hydrothermal experiments by
