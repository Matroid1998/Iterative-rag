Description:
Defined at various physiological levels, influencing biological responses such as hypoxia-inducible factors and DNA damage response.

Notably, cycling or intermittent changes in oxygen levels also occurs in tumors 
and can be exacerbated during therapy.3 Typically, physiological levels of oxygen (physoxia) are defined as 37 
O2, tumor hypoxia is defined as 2 O2, and extreme levels of hypoxia (0.1 O2) termed radiobiological 
hypoxia, are those most associated with resistance to radiotherapy.4,5 Importantly, the biological response differs 
in an oxygendependent manner, for example while the hypoxiainducible factors (HIFs) are induced at both 2 
and 0.1 O2, the DNA damage response or unfolded protein response is restricted to the lower oxygen tension.6 
There is an unmet need for imaging tools that not only detect hypoxia but also inform on the level of oxygen 
present, because median oxygen concentrations within a tumor can range from 4.20.1 O2.4 
One biological response to hypoxia is the production reductase enzymes (cytochrome P450 reductase and 
nitroreductase) that catalyze oxygensensitive bioreductive reactions.
