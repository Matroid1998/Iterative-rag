Description:
A product of the oxidative splitting of water in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Text:
In recent years, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into highervalue products has been 
introduced as a promising and technologically feasible approach for mitigating the negative 
climatic impact of the steadily increasing levels of atmospheric CO2.13 The CO2 reduction 
reaction (CO2RR) may become not only economically feasible but also truly sustainable if the 
surplus of renewable energy originating from solar radiation, wind power, and hydroelectric 
sources is used as energy input to drive the highly endergonic and kinetically hindered CO2 
conversion. The overall electrolysis reaction relies on an oxidative splitting of water (i.e., oxygen 
evolution reaction, OER) through 
O2  4e 4H 2H2O (acidic) Eq. 1 
or 
O2  2H2O  4e4OH (alkaline) Eq. 2 
which is coupled to the reductive conversion of CO2 (denoted hereafter CO2RR).

Description:
The only product that forms on the anode side in aqueous reaction environments.

Text:
In aqueous 
reaction environments, oxygen (O2) is the only product that forms on the anode side regardless of 
the anode material used. However, a variety of CO2RR products can be produced on the cathode, 
including but not limited to carbon monoxide (CO),49 saturated4, 1012 and nonsaturated 
hydrocarbons,11, 1317 and, alcohols with various chain lengths and energy densities (e.g., 
methanol,12, 1820 ethanol,16, 2123 and npropanol24). Formate is another commodity chemical of 
high value.2526 As recently noted by Chen et al.,26 it is the liquid nature of the formateformic 
acid product that enables the downstream product separation following primary electrolysis to be 
conducted with less effort, thus enhancing the profitability of the overall production process. Existing and potential future applications of formateformic acid concern formic acid fuel
