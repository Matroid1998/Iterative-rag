Couple with nucleofuge-containing molecules under basic conditions.

Text:
For our first study, we selected the field of aalkylation of 
carbonyls as it is a central and wellestablished transfor
mation in organic synthesis that could still benefit from im
provement (Figure 1).4 Indeed, the coupling of enolates 
with nucleofugecontaining molecules under basic condi
tions is extensively employed, but its low atomeconomy 
makes it often industrially impracticable.5 Similarly, mod
ern procedures employing a combination of a metalbased 
catalyst with directing amines have allowed the use of al
kenes as coupling partners, which circumvent any waste 
generation.6 However, the expensive catalysts andor rea
gents employed in these protocols make them difficult to 
implement on scale.

Description:
Alternatives to metal-based systems in carbonyl radical addition reactions.

Text:
Despite the current limitations associ
ated with the Mnmediated carbonyl aradical addition to 
olefins (vide infra), we identified this transformation as a 
full atomeconomy alternative to existing enolates and 
metalbased systems. Therefore, we decided to systemati
cally investigate the parameters that govern this reaction to 
assemble a general and robust set of conditions that would 
supplant existing procedures. Figure 1. Introduction to aalkylation of carbonyls.
