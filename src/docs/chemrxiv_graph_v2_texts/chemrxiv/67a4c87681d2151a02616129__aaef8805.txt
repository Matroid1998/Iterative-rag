Description:
Dominates chemistry with a rebound mechanism.

Text:
In contrast, highvalent manganeseoxo systems are less 
explored, primarily due to their poor stability and complicated 
reactivity, often significantly deviating from the established 
rebound 
mechanism, 
which 
dominates 
the 
Feoxo 
chemistry.57 Of the several oxidation states reported for 
terminal Mnoxo complexes (III, IV, and V), Mn(IV)oxo is by 
far the most elusive, making its study beyond spectroscopic 
techniques and computational methods highly challenging.4 
To better understand the structurefunction relationship of 
this important intermediate, a significant body of work on 
such systems was carried out, first by Suslick8 with the picket
fence porphyrins9,10 (complex I, Figure 1a), and later by 
Fukuzumi and Nam11, along with various other polypyridyl 
ligands first reported by the same authors1216 and later 
modified and extensively studied by Jackson17,18 and others19,20
