Studied for their dissociation equilibriums in water at 25Â°C.

It is needless to mention that Hammett equation is ever glowing tool in PhysicalOrganic 
Chemistry 1. Hammett equation has emerged from the study of dissociation equilibriums of 
benzoic acids in water at 25o C 1. There were reports on the application of Hammett equation 
to five membered heterocycles 2, 3. Several studies appeared on the application of Hammett 
equation to benzimidazoles 410. In these studies 410 different versions of arguments 
presented. In halogenated benzimidazolium cations 4, 5(6)halogen substituted compounds 
did not follow Hammett equation which is attributed to the tautomeric nature of the ring, but a
