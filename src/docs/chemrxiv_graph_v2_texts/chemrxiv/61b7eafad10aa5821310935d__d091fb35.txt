Description:
An element used in mixed halide hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites for solar cells.

Lightinduced ion migration has been widely observed in hybrid organicinorganic 
perovskites (HOIPs).14 However, the implications of lightinduced ion transport on device 
performance remain unclear.5 For example, the instability of HOIPs under prolonged exposure to 
light has been attributed to ion migration,6 and yet, selfhealing induced by ion migration under 
cycled illumination may increase the shortterm stability.7 Although the mobility of A and Bsite 
ions is still an ongoing debate, there has been agreement on the transport of halide ions under 
illumination.8 Various experimental and theoretical studies suggest that halide migration is 
dependent on the HOIP composition, but a systematic study to quantify this effect is still lacking.9 
Mixed halide HOIPs employing I and Br have been extensively employed in perovskite solar 
cells (PSCs).
