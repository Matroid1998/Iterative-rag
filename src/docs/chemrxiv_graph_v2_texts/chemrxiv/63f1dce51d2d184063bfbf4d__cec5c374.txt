Description:
Used to prepare optically active unnatural disubstituted amino acids through substitution reactions.

Text:
The halohydrocarboninvolved substitution reaction is one 
of the most classic transformations in organic chemistry for 
the formation of carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom 
bonds.14 With the utilization of halohydrocarbons such as 
aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl halides as reactants, a large number 
of optically active molecules have been constructed via 
SNAr,5 SN1, or SN2 substitutions,67 or via couplings.813 
Among these reactions, the catalytic asymmetric substi
tution reactions of readily available amino acid derivatives 
with halohydrocarbons provide a highly efficient pathway 
for the preparation of optically active unnatural disub
stituted amino acids.1420 However, in those reported 
methodologies, protection and deprotection manipulations 
are always unavoidable (Figure 1, path a).
