Description:
A scaffold known for its proteolytic resistance, blood-brain barrier permeability, and ability to mimic functional pharmacophores.

Text:
Cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) use aminoacylated tRNA (aatRNA) substrates to form 
peptide bonds between two amino acids yielding a cyclic dipeptide product (CDP).1 CDPs 
contain a diketopiperazine ring, a scaffold that has been coined as privileged due to its 
remarkable properties such as proteolytic resistance, bloodbrain barrier permeability and 
the ability to mimic functional pharmacophores. 24 CDPSs act in combination with tailoring 
enzymes, adding significant complexity to the types of natural products that can be 
produced.5,6 Because computational prediction of the specificity of CDPSs is challenging7, 
the determination of substrates and products of each enzyme requires experimental 
testing, in a time consuming and low throughput process.810 Prior to this work there were 
no reports of successfully engineering CDPS enzymes to direct substrate selection.
