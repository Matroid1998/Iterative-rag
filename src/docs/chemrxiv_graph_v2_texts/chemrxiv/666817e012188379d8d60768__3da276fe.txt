Description:
Chiral motifs present in catalysts and ligands.

Text:
Chiral arylsubstituted motifs are not only prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals, but they are also versatile synthons 
and are present in catalystsligands, such as chiral 1,1diarylalkanes,1 benzylic alkynes,2 and axially chiral allenes (Figure 1A).3 As 
demonstrated by chiral 1,1diarylalkanebased drugs, the subtle variation in the (hetero)aryl pharmacophore can often lead to 
variations in biological activity. Consequently, the development of efficient and practical catalytic strategies to streamline the 
installation of different aryl and heteroaryl motifs is an important endeavour for academic and industrial applications.4 Transition
metalcatalyzed asymmetric arylations based on an ionic mechanistic pathway currently provide the most robust method for 
introducing an aryl or heteroaryl group into a specific substrate.
