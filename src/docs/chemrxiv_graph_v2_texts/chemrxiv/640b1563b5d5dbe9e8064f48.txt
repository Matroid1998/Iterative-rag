Description:
An unsaturated compound mentioned in the context of protein degradation.

Text:
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a new paradigm for modulation 
of protein activity in chemical biology and drug discovery13. A viable strategy for TPD 
employs bifunctional protein targeting chimeras (PROTACs), in which small molecule 
protein ligands are linked to a ligand of an E3 ligase to yield bifunctional modalities 
that induce degradation of the protein of interest by the ubiquitinproteasome system 
(UPS)4, 5. Recently also bifunctional degrader modalities have been reported that 
direct the protein of interest to the autophagyrelated proteins LC3B or p62, thereby 
inducing protein degradation by means of macroautophagy6, 7. In particular, it was 
reported that  unsaturated indolinone 1 (R  I; GW5074, Fig.
