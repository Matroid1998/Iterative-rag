Description:
A common heteroatom in aromatic compounds used as a radical center.

2016 was a breakthrough as they were able to achieve strong ferromagnetic coupling with
high thermal stability.24
The typical diradical is comprised of two radical centers (regions where the spin den
sity is predominantly localized) and a coupler that facilitates the exchange interaction be
tween the spin centers. The choice of spin centers, coupler, and the overall geometry of
the diradical dictates the ground spin state and the strength of exchange interaction. The
extensive conjugation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) makes them excellent
candidates as couplers.2528 They allow a high degree of spin delocalization from the radi
cal centers, enabling strong exchange interaction via the mechanism of spin polarization.29
Most radical centers are based around carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen which are common
heteroatoms in aromatic compounds.
