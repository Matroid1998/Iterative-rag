Description:
A solvent used in predicting pKa values for CH bonds using computational methods.

Grzybowski and coworkers recently addressed this gap by predicting pKa values for CH
bonds in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN).3
Using a mix of experimental and computationally computed pKa data, they achieve a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.1 pKa units. Lee and coworkers also address this problem by
creating a general machine learning (ML) model using either a neural network or XGBoost. They train on experimental pKa values in 39 solvents from the Internet Bondenergy Data
bank (iBonD). Hereafter, they can predict the lowest pKa value for a wide range of molecules
that contain bonds such as NH, OH, CH, SH, PH.
