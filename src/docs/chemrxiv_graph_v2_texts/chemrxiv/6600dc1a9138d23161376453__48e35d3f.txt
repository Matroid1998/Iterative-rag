Description:
Used in biodegradable temperature sensors as a nanomembrane material.

Text:
They function 
similarly to the traditional temperature sensors, detecting 
changes in temperature and providing valuable data for 
various applications including environmental monitoring, 
food safety, and healthcare.4 Additionally, in fields like 
healthcare, biodegradable temperature sensors offer a safe 
and environmentally friendly option for monitoring patient 
vitals without the need for invasive procedures or subsequent 
waste management. These sensors are being utilized for real
time temperature monitoring in wound healing, drug delivery 
systems, agricultural monitoring, and environmental sensing. The biodegradable temperature sensors are typically made up 
of materials such as silicon nanomembrane, silk fibroin, 
cellulose derivatives, and biobased polymers.5 The research 
work until now on this area, lacks with respect to sensitivity, 
limited temperature range and demonstrating them with a 
low cost highly scalable techniques.
