Description:
A typical substrate for graphene that influences carrier density through interface charges.

These high energy ebeam processes etched carbon atoms from the graphene lattice,11
17 rotated bonds in the lattice,12,18 and manipulated foreign atoms introduced during graphene 
processing.13,14,17 Other processes either used a lower acceleration voltage (520 kV) to remove 
preexisting defects (e.g. hydrogen19 and fluorine20) from graphene or defined nanostructures 
in graphene (or carbon nanotubes) through etching C atoms away.2125 Ebeam exposure 
experiments inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) have revealed a dosedependent 
modulation of the carrier density in graphene, attributed to charges generated at the interface 
with the substrate (typically SiO2).2630 Importantly, all of these processes use the ebeam to 
manipulate atoms that are already present within the graphene lattice or on its surface without 
any controlled chemistry through substitution reactions.
