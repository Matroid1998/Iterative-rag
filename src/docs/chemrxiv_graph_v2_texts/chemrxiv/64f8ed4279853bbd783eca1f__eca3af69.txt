Description:
A polymer that is soluble in water and in organic solvents.

Thus, they are usually hydrophobic polymers, 
hydrophobic monomers, hydrophobic colloidal particles, or mixtures thereof. As a result, double 
emulsion microcapsule walls are also hydrophobic and, therefore, impermeable for water or water
soluble compounds, unless the capsule wall is micro or nanoporous. However, a shell that is 
semipermeable for watersoluble compounds is essential for many applications. These include, for 
example, applications requiring slow release of hydrophilic cargo from the inside of the capsules, or the 
transport of watersoluble substrates to reach the catalysts within capsule microreactors. One possibility 
to create more polar shells is to use polymers that are soluble in water and in organic solvents, such as 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).
