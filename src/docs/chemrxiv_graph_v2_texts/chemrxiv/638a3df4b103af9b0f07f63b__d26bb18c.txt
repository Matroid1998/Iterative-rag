Description:
A radical that reacts with methanol in an oxidative process.

Text:
The reaction of methanol with the hydroxyl radical is an oxidative process of great 
importance in cold interstellar space, atmosphere and combustion (i.e., verylow, low and 
high temperatures)25 and has been widely studied from different perspectives 
mechanism, kinetics and dynamics, using experimental and theoretical tools. With respect 
to the mechanism, this reaction proceeds through a common reactant complex (RC) and 
from here two paths appear (R1 and R2), with their respective saddle points (SP) and 
product complexes (PC), to finish in the respective products, CH2OH  H2O and CH3O 
 H2O, respectively, 

SP1  PC1  CH2OH  H2O 

(R1) 
OH  CH3OH  RC 

SP2  PC2  CH3O  H2O
