An estimated 63 to 142 billion drinking straws are used in the United States annually,1 
38 
contributing to the approximately 19 billion USD drinking straw market.2 Complementary to 
39 
their significant usage, drinking straws are a common, visibly jarring marine litter, accounting 
40 
for approximately 5 of all shoreline and nearshore debris.3 Because of this and their potential 
41 
to harm charismatic megafauna, municipalities, states, and countries have begun restricting 
42 
conventional polypropylene (PP) singleuse straws in favor of those made from materials 
43 
marketed as more degradable. Major brands have started adopting many of these bioplastic 
44 
alternatives as they increasingly require the plastics they use to be biodegradable in all natural 
45 
environments.
