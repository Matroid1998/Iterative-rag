Thiosemicarbazones have been increasingly recognized for their potential as effective anticancer 
agents.1 Specifically, those belonging to the di2pyridylthiosemicarbazone (DpT) class have 
shown great promise.2 The hallmark of DpTs is their NNS binding motif that facilitates coordination 
to metal ions such as Cu(II) and Fe(II).3 Metalion coordination affects various cellular targets, 
ultimately impacting the viability of cells by, for instance, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase4, 
upregulation of Nmyc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)5,6, downregulation of cyclin D1 
leading to cell cycle arrest7, as well as others.2,3,8 Among the many DpTs studied over the years, 
di2pyridylketone4,4dimethyl3thiosemicarbazone 
(Dp44mT) 
and 
di2pyridylketone4
cyclohexyl4methyl3thiosemicarbazone (DpC) (Figure 1) emerged as the most prominent 
candidates by exhibiting excellent selective antiproliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo
