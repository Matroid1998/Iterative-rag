Commercial Liion batteries with high energy densities and promising rate performance 
are highly desired to meet the increasing demand for portable electronic devices and 
electric vehicles.14 LiCoO2, as the first generation of commercial cathode materials, 
still dominants the 3C electronic market owing to its advantages of a high theoretical 
capacity, a fast Li ion conductivity and a high energy density.5, 6 Although the theoretical 
capacity of the LiCoO2 can reach up to 274 mAh g1, only a half capacity can be utilized 
during the discharging process, which greatly limits practical applications.79 
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improve the practical capacity. Expanding the 
voltage window to a high voltage is a common strategy to achieve this goal.
