Description:
A metal with a high atomic number of 78, contributing significantly to scattering intensity.

Text:
In the case of carbonsupported Pt catalysts, the contribution of carbon can 
usually be ignored, because the number of electrons per atom (atomic number) is far 
greater for Pt than for carbon (78 vs. 6, the scattering intensity is proportional to the square 
of the atomic number). However, if only a small number of Pt particles exist on carbon, 
the contribution of carbon cannot be ignored. This situation could result in erroneous 
estimation of particle size distributions, especially when the carbon has mesopores with 
sizes similar to those of Pt catalysts. One way to overcome this problem would be through the use of anomalous SAXS 
(ASAXS, e.g., 1012).
