Description:
Well-known dye molecules extensively studied and implemented in light-absorbing systems.

Additional features 
such as stacking, degree of conjugation or interaction between different monomers triggered 
by the organic skeleton also directly impact the optoelectronic properties.4 
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives are wellknown dye molecules that have been 
extensively studied and implemented in lightabsorbing systems.5 BODIPYs are robust 
enough to undergo a broad range of chemical transformations and specific core modifications 
allow the modulation of the photophysical properties in a precise manner.
