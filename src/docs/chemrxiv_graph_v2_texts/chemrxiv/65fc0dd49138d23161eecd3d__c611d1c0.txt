Description:
A segment found in phloroglucinol meroterpenoids.

Cleistocalyx 
operculatus (Roxb.) Merr. and Perry, a tree native to southern 
China, has been traditionally used to treat cold, fever, and 
inflammation 
with extracts 
from its buds and leaves.11 
Cleistocaltone A (1, Figure 1), a polymethylated phloroglucinol 
meroterpenoid (PPM) isolated from the buds of C. operculatus 
by Ye, Wang, and coworkers in 2019, was demonstrated to 
possess promising in vitro activity against RSV.12 
In nature, components from diverse classes of natural products 
frequently merge to form compounds with novel biological 
activities. Among these classes, phloroglucinol meroterpenoids 
stand out.13 These compounds consist of a phloroglucinol 
segment and a terpene segment. The terpene portion typically 
originates from a geranyl group, which undergoes a series of 
biosynthetic 
transformations 
involving 
oxidation 
and 
cyclization.
