Ions involved in the transport cycle of symporters, depicted as orange circles.

Until recently, capturing highresolution snapshots of 
intermediates along the transport cycle was a daunting task6,7. To complement the static 
snapshots, solutionstate measurements, carried out in the absence or presence of various 
substrates under conditions conducive to interconversion between conformations, directly report 
on the transporters energy landscape and allow highresolution snapshots to be assigned to specific 
intermediate states observed in the functional cycle811. However, few transporters have been 
exhaustively characterized to enable integration of structure, dynamics, and function12. Figure 1. Transport cycle, reaction coordinate, and architecture of the bacterial amino acid 
transporter LeuT. (A) Cartoon depiction of a generic symporters transport cycle as it isomerizes 
between outwardfacing, occluded, and inwardfacing conformations. Sodium ions and substrate 
shown as orange and purple circles, respectively. Mock reaction coordinate shown below.
