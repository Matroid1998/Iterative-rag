Description:
Can be formed from terpene-derived monomers and contribute to a sustainable plastics economy.

Transforming processes to use abundant renewable resources and afford a reduced carbon footprint 
is of great importance.1,2 By replacing petrochemicallyderived polymers with bioderived 
alternatives, opportunity arises to build a circular plastics economy where waste production is 
minimized.24 Interest in renewable monomers from biomass feedstocks is rapidly growing, with 
studies on sources such as vegetable oils,5 cellulose,6 lignin,7 and starch.8 Additionally, a relatively 
new area of research has shown how terpenes, which are mainly derived from plants, can be 
modified to provide various monomers for the formation of polyurethanes, polyesters (PEs), 
polycarbonates (PCs), and more.911 By reacting terpenederived cyclic anhydrides with CO2 
andor epoxides, new aliphatic PCs andor PEs are formed that can contribute to a more sustainable 
plastics economy while also providing a method of indirect carbon storage within the polymer 
architecture.
