Description:
Undergo catalytic hydroboration with hydroborates to generate vinylboronates.

Text:
Vinylboronates play a pivotal role in modern organic synthesis as essential synthons in selective 
carboncarbon or carbonheteroatom bond formation reactions which are important especially in the 
pharmaceutical, agrochemical and cosmetic industries. 1 Catalytic hydroboration of alkynes with 
hydroborates is a powerful tool for generating vinylboronates (Scheme 1) and this transformation 
usually occurs via synaddition of a BH moiety to yield (E)vinylboronate esters.2 Recently, a new 
generation of catalysts for selective alkyne hydroboration was reported. They were based on earth 
abundant first row transition metal complexes with tridentate nitrogencontaining ligands and have 
attracted considerable attention. 3,4 These benchstable precatalysts required activation, usually 
using alkali metal trialkylborohydrides, to achieve high catalytic activity. 3

Description:
Unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.

Hydroboration of terminal and internal alkynes has been also successful using transition metalfree, 
boroncontaining 
catalysts 
(e.g. B(C6F5)3, 
borenium 
cations, 
HB(C6F5)2, 
tris3,5
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylborane, tris(2,4,6trifluorophenyl)borane, H3BTHF) 5,6,7,8,9,10
