Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction in proton exchange fuel cells.

A significant con
tributor is the transport of people and goods, which in a hydrogen 
economy with fuel cell electric vehicles would be shifted from fossil 
resources to green energy.1 While today, platinum group metal 
catalysts are used in fuel cell chemistry, metal and nitrogen doped 
carbon (MNC) catalysts play an increasingly important role as 
cheap and earth abundant substitutes in different types of fuel cell,2
5 and other energy conversion reactions such as water splitting and 
carbon dioxide reduction or in metal air batteries.612 For the oxy
gen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange fuel cells 
(PEFC), FeNC catalysts reach activities comparable to low
platinum content PtC catalysts.2, 45 
FeNC catalysts are typically prepared by pyrolysis, e.g.

Description:
Can be bound end-on or side-on in FeN4 sites during ORR activity.

Such a detailed understand
ing is a prerequisite for the systematic optimization of the prepara
tion methodology, targeting catalysts with high active site densities 
and turnover frequencies while avoiding catalyst degradation. According to Chung et al.,2 the ORR active sites are FeN4 centers 
at the edges of graphene layers and OHadsorbed intermediates are 
formed spontaneously at relevant potentials. Zitolo et al.27 attribute 
the ORR activity to two FeN4 sites based on fits to Kedge XAS 
data (EXAFS, XANES) albeit without firm assignment to Mss
bauer signatures one featuring two endon bound oxygen mole
cules, the other a sideon bound oxygen molecule.
