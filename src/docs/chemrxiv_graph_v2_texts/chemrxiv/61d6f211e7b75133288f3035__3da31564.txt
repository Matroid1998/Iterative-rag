Description:
Involved in a triangle of closely located ions, including T3 and T2 sites coordinated by histidine residues.

Text:
The TNC contains a triangle of closely located copper 
ions including a pair of T3 copper ions coordinated by three histidine residues each and one T2 
copper ion coordinated by two histidine residues. Electrons are accepted from substrate at the T1 
copper site. Via an electrontransfer chain the electrons are transferred to the TNC where 
molecular oxygen reduction reaction O2  4e  4H  2H2O occurs (Solomon et al., 1996; 
Jones and Solomon, 2015). The TNC is connected to surrounding solvent via the T3 and T2 
channels clearly observed in structures as chains of water molecules (Fig 1 in Polyakov et al., 
2017). Molecular oxygen gets to the TNC through the T3 channel.

Description:
Involved in oxidation to Cu(II) and forms part of a triangle with oxygen ligands.

Text:
The T2 and one of T3 
copper ions are oxidized to Cu(II) and there is oxygen ligand near the T2 copper ion involved. In 
the native intermediate (NI) state all three copper ions are oxidized to charge 2e and there are 
three oxygen ligands involved. One is the oxygen ligand near ion T2, one in the center of the 
copper ions triangle and one between two copper ions T3. The last two appear from peroxide 
when the OO bond is broken. Each of T3 copper ions is fivecoordinated by three nitrogen 
atoms of histidine residues and by two oxygen ligands between the T3 copper ions in the TNC.
