Description:
Released from diazo compounds in the presence of a catalyst, particularly a metal complex catalyst.

For instance, Ariafard et al.31 ex
plored the R2 substitution impact, whereas the R1 site
is decorated by a few phenyl derivatives. In this case,
the activation barriers ranged from 26.7 to 35.1 kcalmol. Clearly, the direct attachment of electronwithdrawing or
electrondonating functional groups to the carbon carry
ing the diazo group, i.e. R1 site, will result in a more
pronounced electronic effect and, subsequently, can ex
ert a greater influence on the stability of the transition
structure. Moreover, a substantial portion of the stud
ies is devoted to the mechanism underlying the release of
N2 from diazo compounds in the presence of a catalyst,
particularly a metal complex catalyst 33, 3741.

Description:
A gas whose release kinetics are affected by structural modification.

Text:
It is
important to note that DFT is an accurate approxima
tion, but scales with system size, whereas ML is fast but
limited by database size and reliability. By combining
these two approaches, we can uncover previously unseen
correlations and gain a deeper understanding of chemical
reactions. We aim to address the following questions i) How
does the structural modification affect the kinetics of the
N2 gas release? It provides us with information on both
the reactivity and stability of the diazo compounds. ii)
