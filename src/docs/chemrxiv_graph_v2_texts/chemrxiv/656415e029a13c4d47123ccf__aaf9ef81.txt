Description:
A five-membered ring that reduces sterical hindrance in AAPs.

Text:
In AAPs the sterical hindrance between 
the two aromatic rings is reduced due to its less bulky fivemembered pyrazole ring instead of a second 
phenyl ring in ABs. An optimized orthogonal Zconformation can be achieved by adding two methyl 
groups at the orthopositions of the pyrazole. These dimethylpyrazoleAAPs therefore have improved 
backswitching performance compared to their AB counterparts, showing photoconversion yields as 
high as  98  in the photostationary state (PSS)57. Due to the growing use of AAPs as photoswitches, 
the question arises if the ultrafast dynamics of AAPs resemble that of AB. To the best of our knowledge, 
we report the first study on the ultrafast photoswitching dynamics of AAPs.
