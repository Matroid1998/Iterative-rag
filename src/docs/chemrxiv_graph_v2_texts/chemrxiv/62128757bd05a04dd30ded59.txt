Description:
A metal ion introduced via phosvitin that catalyzes lipid oxidation in mayonnaise.

LDL particles feature
13
a coreshell structure where a core of triglycerides cholesteryl
14
esters is surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and
15
apolipoproteins. During the emulsification of mayonnaise,
16
LDL particles can release phospholipids and apolipoproteins
17
that together with phosvitin adsorb at the oilwater droplet
18
interface. LDLs can also remain structurally intact and form
19
granules present in the continuous phase or adsorbed at the
20
oilwater interface depending on mechanical treatments and
21
conditions (Anton et al., 2003; Mizutani and Nakamura, 1985;
22
Sirvente et al., 2007). 23
Lipid oxidation in mayonnaise is mediated by free radical
24
chain reactions (Schaich, 2012) and catalysed by the presence
25
of metal ions such as iron introduced via phosvitin (Berton
26
Carabin et al., 2014).
