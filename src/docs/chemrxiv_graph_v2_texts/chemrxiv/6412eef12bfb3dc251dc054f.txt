Description:
A binding partner of histidine-rich glycoprotein involved in essential regulatory biological processes.

Text:
Mammalian histidinerich glycoprotein (HRG) is a glycosylated protein of 70 kDa in size and is present 
in blood plasma at relatively high concentrations (1.5 M).1 It has numerous binding partners, such 
as heparin, plasminogen, divalent metal ions, and heme, and is involved in many essential regulatory 
biological processes, including blood coagulation, cell migration, proliferation and adhesion, tumour 
growth inhibition and angiogenesis, as well as immune complex clearance.17 HRG has therefore been 
referred to as the Swiss Army knife of mammalian plasma.8 

Despite a plethora of functions, there is surprisingly little experimental evidence illuminating HRG 
structure.
