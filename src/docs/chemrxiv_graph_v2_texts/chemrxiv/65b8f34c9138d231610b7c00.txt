Description:
Materials capable of capturing and storing thermal energy.

Text:
Current estimates predict that over half of the generated thermal energy is lost as process heat.32 
Hence, in order to reduce heat loss and to increase the overall system efficiency, there is an urgent 
need for materials which are capable of capturing and storing thermal energy at temperature levels 
adapted to the respective conversion process.33 Established and widelyused materials for this 
purpose include metalsalt hydrates and paraffins.3436 To facilitate the capture and release of
