Description:
Lipids including DLPC and DMPC, differing in carbon tails.

Text:
Notably, their CG representations have remained mostly 
conserved since the inception of the FF3,18 and do not allow to differentiate between some of the lipids. This 
is the case, e.g., of phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids DLPC and DMPC, respectively including 12 and 14 
carbons per tail and currently represented by identical CG models (Fig. 1c), while their phosphateto
phosphate bilayer thickness (D) differ by 15 at room temperature19,20. The exclusive usage of big 
beads for modeling the fatty acids, which are designed to represent 4 heavy atoms and their associated 
hydrogens, does not provide enough resolution to differentiate between the two lipids. Further refining the 
CG representation of the models, in principle, will allow to further enhance thermodynamic properties of 
lipids and lipid mixtures in Martini simulations4,21.
