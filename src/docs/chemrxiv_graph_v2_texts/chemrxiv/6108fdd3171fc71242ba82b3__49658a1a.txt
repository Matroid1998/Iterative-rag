Description:
A naphthol derivative that couples effectively to form heterocoupled biaryls.

of different 
123 
groups on the naphthol coupling partner was possible. A 6bromo substituent coupled effectively to afford biaryl 3aa 
124 
in 66 yield and 937 e.r. ; a more conjugating group in 6phenyl was also successful to afford 3ab with lower 
125 
conversion (52 yield) and 9010 e.r. We are able to accommodate groups on both coupling partners a 6methyl 
126 
indole coupled with a 6bromo naphthol to exclusively afford the heterocoupled biaryl 3ac (67 yield; 8812 e.r.). 127 
This principle can be extended to the formation of different biaryls such as 3ad (76 yield, 919 e.r.).
