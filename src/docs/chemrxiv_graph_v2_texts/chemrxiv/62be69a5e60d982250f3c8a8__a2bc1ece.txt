Description:
Usually served as excellent cyclic hosts for encapsulation.

Hostguest supramolecular complexes formed by molecular interactions, in which 
various guest molecules are accommodated in crack, cavity, or cage of host 
compounds, have made great contributions to the development of advanced functional 
materials.14 One of the most prominent examples of hostguest system is the binding 
of host and guest molecules through noncovalent interactions between 
complementary convexconcave surfaces. Traditionally, fullerenes C60 and C70 have 
long been studied as guests in various organic architectures due to their unusual 
spherical structure, and the cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) were usually served as 
excellent cyclic hosts for encapsulation.
