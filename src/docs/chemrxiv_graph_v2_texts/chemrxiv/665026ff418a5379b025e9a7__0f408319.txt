Description:
Produced from the decomposition of N2O.

It is well known that N2O has a global warming potential approximately 300 times greater than that of 
CO2 on a permass basis. Additionally, N2O is a significant contributor to stratospheric ozone 
depletion.13 Emissions of N2O from industries that use fossil fuels, burn biomass, and chemical 
plants that produce nitric and adipic acids are increasing annually.4 Without global mitigation efforts, 
N2O emissions are expected to nearly double by 2050.5 Consequently, effective catalytic post
treatment technologies must be developed to treat the N2O emissions from stationary systems and 
vehicles burning transportation fuels. Various methods exist for decomposing N2O into harmless N2, such as thermal, 
electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic systems.612 Although electrocatalytic and photocatalytic systems 
can operate at ambient temperatures, their catalytic activities are reduced in the presence of O2.
