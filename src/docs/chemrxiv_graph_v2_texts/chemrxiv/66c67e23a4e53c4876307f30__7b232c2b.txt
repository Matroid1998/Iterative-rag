Formed from aldehydes during electrocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation in alkaline media.

Biomassderived organic oxidation reactions are thus increasingly being investigated as 
alternatives to OER that could reduce the cost of green hydrogen and provide valuable 
anode products.2 
Electrocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (EOD) of biomassderived aldehydes 
(Equation 1) is a particularly intriguing alternative anode reaction 
EOD RCHO  2 OH  RCOO  H2O   H2  e

Favored in alkaline media, the EOD pathway can selectively transform aldehydes into 
carboxylates while simultaneously producing H2 gas at the anode, at potentials positive of 
the equilibrium potential for standard hydrogen oxidation.3 This oneelectron pathway 
stands in contrast to the more common twoelectron pathway (standard electrochemical 
oxidation, ECO, equation 2) 
ECO RCHO  3 OH  RCOO  2 H2O  2 e 
(2) 
Au, Ag, and Cu anodes are established to prefer the EOD pathway at low overpotentials4 
while other simple metal electrocatalysts generally oxidize hydrogen to H2O and therefore 
primarily catalyze ECO.5 At higher potentials, oxidation of (presumptively) adsorbed 
hydrogen (reverse Volmer reaction) becomes more kinetically favorable, and higher organic 
oxidation products (e.g., CO2) may also be obtained, reducing the selectivity and electron 
efficiency of organic product formation.6 
Anodic hydrogen was observed at least as early as the 1980s, primarily as a product 
of formaldehyde oxidation.79 EOD has regained interest due to the possibility of utilizing 
biomassderived (carbon neutral) reactants and producing dualelectrode hydrogen at 
scale with low costs for materials (copper electrodes) and electricity (low cell voltage).
