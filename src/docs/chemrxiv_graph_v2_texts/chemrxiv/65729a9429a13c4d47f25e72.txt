Description:
Inhibits nanozymatic activity by decreasing enzymelike residual activity.

Text:
of the glutathione molecules in the reaction media. Hence, the inhibitory 
effect of glutathione molecules on their nanozymatic activity was evaluated as a function 
of enzymelike residual activity in the presence of glutathione molecules. The results 
reveal that the relative activity of nanozymes was inhibited by increasing the glutathione 
concentration in the reaction media and reached its minimum value (45) when the 
glutathione concentration was 14 M and then leveled off. Keywords Ndoped carbon dots; nanozymes inhibitors; glutathione
