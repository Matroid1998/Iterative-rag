Description:
Block copolymers used in hybrid vesicles for nanomedicine and biotechnology applications.

Text:
Therefore, hybrid lipidpolymer vesicles aim to take 
advantage of the robustness and chemical versatility of a polymer membrane as well as the 
biocompatibility and softness provided by a lipid bilayer.6, 7 
While a variety of block copolymer chemical structures have been blended with phospholipids, 
polybutadienepoly(ethylene oxide) (PBdPEO) block copolymers are one of the most commonly 
studied examples.816 PBdPEO containing hybrid vesicles may have potential applications in 
nanomedicine 17 and the augmentation of membrane proteins for biotechnology applications such as 
targeted drug delivery, sensors or artificial cells.8, 16, 18 
Focusing on membrane protein biotechnology, PBd22PEO14 has been blended with POPC lipids for 
the reconstitution of the membrane enzyme cytochrome bo3; all hybrid compositions studied were 
found to maintain  40 of their initial reconstituted protein activity after 41 days storage at 4 C, a 
significant improvement over purely lipid vesicles.8 Further study revealed that 5050 mol PBd22
PEO14POPC hybrid vesicles retain 20 of their initial activity after 500 days storage, where the rate 
of decay in enzyme activity is approximately 5 times slower than for proteoliposomes.19 Other 
membrane proteins have been successfully reconstituted using PBdPEO hybrid vesicles.

PBd22
PEO14 blended with E.coli extracted lipids has been used to successfully reconstitute two ATP 
binding cassette membrane proteins, Pgp or NaAtm1.9 Combinations of membrane proteins have also 
been successfully reconstituted into PBdPEO hybrid vesicles F0F1 ATP synthase and 
bacteriorhodopsin in 50 mol PBd22PEO14POPC hybrid vesicles retained  50 of their activity 
after 42 days.10 Besides enhanced durability of protein function, block copolymers have been shown 
to enhance membrane protein folding into hybrid vesicles up to 25 mol of PBd22PEO14 or PBd12
PEO9 in DOPC hybrid vesicles enhanced MScL protein folding during cellfree expression.20 
Therefore improved understanding of the physicochemical properties of these hybrid membranes 
should further enhance their optimisation for membrane protein biotechnology.

Description:
A hybrid polymer used in the formation of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).

Text:
Early work on the properties hybrid PBdPEO giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) 
investigated the large PBd46PEO30 polymer mixed with POPC.13, 14 Mixing between these 
components was not ideal at low lipid composition, where it was assumed that a high energy cost for 
insertion of these larger polymers into a thin lipid membrane frustrated hybrid vesicle formation, and 
no GUVs were observed at intermediate compositions.13 The GUV membranes that were formed in 
this study were, however, homogeneous, but biotinylation of either the lipid or polymer and cross
linking by addition of the multivalent neutravidin protein did result in microscopic domain formation.
