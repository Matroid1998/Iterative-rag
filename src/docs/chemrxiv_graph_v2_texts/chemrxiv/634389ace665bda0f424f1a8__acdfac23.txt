Description:
A component in bifunctional catalytic systems for polymerizations.

Text:
Organocatalysts are increasingly applied in polymerizations owing to their environmental 
friendliness, low toxicity, and inexpensiveness, resulting in desirable metalfree polymers.2426 
Based on the cooperative dual activation of monomers and chain ends, mono or bicomponent 
bifunctional catalytic systems consisting of electrophilic and nucleophilic moieties have been 
extensively demonstrated for ROP and ROCOP.6,27 In particular, thiourea and boron groups
