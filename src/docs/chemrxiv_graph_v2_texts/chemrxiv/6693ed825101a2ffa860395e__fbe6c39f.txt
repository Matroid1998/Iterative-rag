Description:
A promising ionically conductive oxide that exhibits cornersharing tetrahedra.

Text:
Cornersharing frameworks were recently reported to be a characteristic of anion frame
works that enable superionic conduction in oxides.1 Previous work attributed the high ionic
conductivity imparted by cornersharing connectivity to the distorted lithium environment
and screened interaction between lithium and nonlithium cations. LiGa(SeO3)2 has been
identified computationally and experimentally as a promising ionically conductive oxide that
exhibits cornersharing tetrahedra. Because sulfides are typically more ionically conductive
and more plastic than oxides, in this work, we set out to study the properties of a hypo
thetical isovalent sulfide of stoichiometry LiGa(SeO3)2. For this, we utilized ML interatomic
potentials trained on custom density functional theory (DFT) data.
