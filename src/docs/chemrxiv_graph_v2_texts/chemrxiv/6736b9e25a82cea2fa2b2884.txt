Description:
Has a variable oxidation state and a high surface-to-volume ratio, enhancing its versatility for catalytic applications.

Text:
These 
distinguish them from larger Cu nanoparticles, as the electronic 
and optical behaviors shift dramatically at the nanoscale, 
unlocking a wide array of potential applications.1422 A key 
advantage of Cu NCs lies in the variable oxidation state of Cu 
and high surfacetovolume ratio enhances their versatility for 
catalytic applications.23 Additionally, the natural abundance and 
lower cost, compared to precious metals like Au and Ag, make 
Cu NCs highly attractive for practical and largescale catalytic 
processes.
