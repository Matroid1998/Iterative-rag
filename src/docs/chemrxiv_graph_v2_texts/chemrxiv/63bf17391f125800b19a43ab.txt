Description:
A compound that can be functionalized for polymerization.

Additionally, the biobased materials must be comparable in both cost and 
physical properties to currently available plastics and petroleum resources to be a competitive 
alternative.8,9 Two of the most abundant biopolymers are cellulose and lignin, which together are known 
as lignocellulosic biomass.10,11 They can be obtained from trees and grassy plants and lignin is an abundant 
waste material, with over 70 million tons produced annually from the paper pulping industry.12 Due to the 
abundance and ease of availability, lignocellulosic biomass is a lowcost, biobased resource. Additionally, lignin can be valorized to give vanillin, which also can be functionalized for polymerization.

Vanillin has grown to become a popular material for biobased polymers, because of its versatility.13,14 
Soybean oil is another abundant and lowcost biobased resource with over 50 million tons produced 
annually.13,15 Acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) can be used as a UV curable coating, however it 
is often blended with petroleumbased monomers due to its limitations with thermal and mechanical 
properties and poor flowability.13 In recent years, there have been some reports that effectively use AESO 
with biobased materials such as tannic acid, vanillin, and itaconic acid.13,15 
Lignin is an amorphous macromolecule with a rigid and highly aromatic structure mainly composed of 
three repeating monolignol units sinapyl, coniferyl and pcoumaryl alcohols.10,16 Lignin has antioxidant, 
UV blocking, and antimicrobial properties.17,18 When used in polymer systems, the large aromatic 
monomer content of lignin can provide mechanical strength and thermal stability.12 Lignin is separated 
from cellulose through several different methods, of which all give variability in structure, and the amount 
of hydroxyl functionality on the molecule.19 Due to the complexity, variability and often poor solubility, 
lignin is mainly used as a filler or modified for compatibility in polymer systems.10,12,17,2023 
Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a method that creates materials in a layerbylayer manner to 
create a threedimensional object.24 3D printing is an extremely customizable method that creates less 
waste compared to traditional plastic production methods.25 Vat photopolymerization is a 3D printing 
technique that uses a UV or LED light source, such as a projector in digital light projection (DLP), to
