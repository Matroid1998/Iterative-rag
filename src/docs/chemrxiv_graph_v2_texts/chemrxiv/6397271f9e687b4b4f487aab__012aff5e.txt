Description:
Explored as cluster-based catalysts for reductive chemical transformations.

Text:
By using enzymes, metalcontaining cofactors, and 
related species, Nature has catalytically optimized 
selectivities and rates of numerous reduction and oxidation 
reactions, including reactions essential for sustaining life. Metaloxygen adducts are known to catalyze selective 
oxidation reactions. The manganesecalciumoxo cubane in 
the oxygen evolving complex in Photosystem II is an 
example, as is cytochrome P450 for catalysis of oxidative 
metabolism.13 For reduction and electron transport, Nature 
often uses enzyme cofactors that contain pairs or clusters 
of firstrow transition metal ions coordinated, in part, by 
sulfur. Examples 
are 
FeFe 
and 
FeNicontaining 
hydrogenases,4,5 molybdenumiron (sulfur),6 vanadium
iron 
(sulfur),7 
and 
alliron 
(sulfur) 
containing 
nitrogenases,8 and ironsulfur cubanes for electron 
transport.9 Taking inspiration from Nature we want to 
explore 
stabilized, 
clusterbased 
metalchalcogenide 
catalysts for reductive chemical transformations. Synthetic metaloxide films, nanoparticles, clusters, etc.
