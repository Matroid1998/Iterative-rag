Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding interactions derived from immobile branched DNA junctions.

Text:
This welldefined methodology, which 
can be assisted by computational designation, has provided the possibility of precisely 
knitting various patterns and structures from onedimensional (1D) to three
dimensional (3D) or even hierarchical assemblies2, 5, 6, 7. The DNA tilebased 
method, which is also based on hydrogen bonding interaction derived from immobile 
branched DNA junctions8, is the other approach in synthesizing DNA 
nanostructures9, 10 and can also be used in crystals and periodic assemblies with 
characterization and programming of designed arbitrary shapes and geometries1, 
11, 12, 13. 2.
