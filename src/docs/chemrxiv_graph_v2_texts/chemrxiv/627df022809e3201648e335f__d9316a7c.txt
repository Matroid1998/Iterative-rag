Description:
Has a rather hydrophilic nature.

Here, we report three 2D and 3D hydrazidelinked COFs 
following postsynthetic oxidation of the hydrazinelinking 
units (Scheme 1). Considering the rather hydrophilic 
nature of the hydrazine and hydrazide linkages, we chose 
to study the effect of the synthetic transformations with 
water vapor sorption analysis.16,17 This not only allowed us 
to explore new sorbents for water harvesting from air, but 
also provided us with additional insight into the micro 
and macroscopic changes occurring on the framework. Scheme 1. Synthetic strategy for hydrazidelinked COFs. This strategy was applied to a molecular model system and 
two 2D (hcb, sql) and one 3D (dia) COFs.
