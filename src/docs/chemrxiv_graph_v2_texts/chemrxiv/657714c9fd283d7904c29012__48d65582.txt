Found in natural products.

Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of oxoamides in 
peptide and protein backbones and their properties have been 
explored extensively in organic and medicinal chemistry, leading 
to FDA approved drugs contain thiocarbonyls such as 
propylthiouracil and thiamazole used for the treatment of 
hyperthyroidism in various diseases,1 and the antibiotics 
etionamide and protionamide used for the treatment of 
tuberculosis.2 At the same time, thioamides have been used as 
key intermediates for the synthesis of various heterocycles and 
for latestage functionalization of peptides. Thioamides are also 
found in natural products such as the thionated nucleosides 2
thiouridine 
and 
4thiouridine,3 
cycasthioamide4 
the 
polythioamide closthioamide, isolated from the anaerobic 
bacterium Clostridium cellulolyctium,5 and peptides such as 
thioviridamide6 (Scheme 1).
