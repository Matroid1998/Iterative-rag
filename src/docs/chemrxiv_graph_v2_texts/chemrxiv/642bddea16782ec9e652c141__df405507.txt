Description:
Undergoes oxidation upon exposure to reaction gas.

The reversible (de)alloying is further supported by the observation 
that changes occur continuously over a single cycle. Thus, gasswitching experiments reveal 
oxidation of a proportion of the Zn found in the reduced catalyst upon exposure to reaction gas. At the Au L3 edge gas switching revealed subtle changes across the cycle (SI S5). While these 
changes coincide with the changes at the Zn K edge, the magnitude of the observed change is 
smaller and limited time resolution renders further analysis challenging. Furthermore, the oxi
dation of such a small fraction of the Zn present would not significantly affect the bulk AuZn 
structure, 
or 
the 
5d 
hole 
distribution 
within 
the 
nanoparticle. Figure 4. MCR analysis of gas switching experiments.
