Description:
A biodegradable polymer with a low melting point of 60Â°C.

Melt electrowriting (MEW) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technology that harnesses 
phenomenon resulting from an electrical field1 applied to a molten polymer delivery system to produce 
porous 3D structures2. This technique can result in precise deposition and stacking of extruded micrometric 
fibers, providing fine control over the spatial details of the processed sample. As a result, MEW has gained 
interest in biomedical research for fabricating scaffolds in a spectrum of applications24. Furthermore, 
MEW enables localized manipulation of functional material properties, which has recently been exploited 
in the development of sensing structures5, soft robotics6, and actuators7. MEW research to date has primarily focused on processing medicalgrade poly(caprolactone) 
(PCL)8, 9, a biodegradable polymer with a low melting point of 60C.
