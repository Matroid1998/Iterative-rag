Description:
Displays native p-type conductivity and consistently shows one of the highest figures of merit for any p-type transparent conductor.

19,20 Therefore, research into nonoxides
has taken centre stage in recent years, 2126 in the hope that greater valence band delocalisation
and bond covalency can improve hole mobility while simultaneously generating enough carriers
to enable degenerate conductivity. One such material is copper iodide, CuI, rst discovered in 1907 by the father of transparent
conductors Karl Bdeker, 27 and now enjoying somewhat of a renaissance. It crystallises in the
cubic zincblende structure below 643 K (Figure 1a), possesses an optical band gap of around 3 eV,
displays native ptype conductivity, and consistently shows one of the highest gures of merit, ,1
for any ptype transparent conductor (over 60 000 M1 for Sdoped CuI).

Description:
Has a zincblende crystal structure with Cu and I atoms in tetrahedral coordination.

2830 It has a disperse,
isotropic valence band maximum (Figure 1b), with an average light hole parabolic effective mass
of around 0.21, indicative of reasonably high hole mobility. The valence band maximum is formed
by the interaction of Cu 32 and I 5orbitals, while the conduction band minimum is formed by
the interaction of Cu 4with I 5orbitals, 31,32 as shown schematically in the molecular orbital (MO)
diagram in Figure 1c. (a) Zincblende crystal structure of
CuI, viewed along the face diagonal. Cu and I atoms in blue and green,
respectively. Cu have tetrahedral
