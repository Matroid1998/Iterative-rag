Description:
Cheaper, more accessible, and more stable than aryl iodides.

As a continuation of our interest in the catalytic synthesis of chiral alkylaminebearing 
molecules,7f, 18 we report herein the first NiHcatalyzed enantioselective hydrocarbonation of N
indolylsubstituted alkenes with arylalkenylalkynyl bromides, analogous to the C(sp3)
C(sp2)C(sp) crosscoupling reaction, enabling a unified method toward structually diverse 
chiral Nalkylindoles in high yields and ees (Fig. 1D). It is worth noticing that the arene 
substrates in NiHcatalyzed hydroarylation reactions have commonly been limited to aryl 
iodides, and use of aryl bromides remained elusive.15h,16b,16f,16g From a practicality perspective, 
aryl bromides are usually cheaper, more accessible, and more stable than the corresponding aryl 
iodides.
