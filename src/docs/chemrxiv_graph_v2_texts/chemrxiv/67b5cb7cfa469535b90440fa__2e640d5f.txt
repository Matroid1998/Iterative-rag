Description:
Proposed as a desirable hydrogen carrier due to its hydrogen density and as a direct fuel.

Text:
The question of dihydrogen, how it is produced, and how it is used is central to sustainability issues 
and the decarbonization of the industry.1 The reversibility of catalytic hydrogenation and 
dehydrogenation processes is at the heart of this question, as is the transport of H2 by liquid organic 
carriers (LOHC).2 This is particularly true in research on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and shipping. Ammonia has been proposed as a desirable hydrogen carrier for the latter because of its hydrogen 
density and also as a direct fuel.3 Still, direct ammonia combustion poses the question of N2O formation, 
a potent greenhouse gas.4 Catalytic processes that combine the cleavage of H2 and selective transfer 
to nitrogen are desirable.

Description:
Produced industrially by nitrogen hydrogenation in the Haber-Bosch process.

Text:
Using lowcost heterogeneous catalytic systems, the HaberBosch process is 
currently the most efficient industrial process for producing ammonia by nitrogen hydrogenation.5
