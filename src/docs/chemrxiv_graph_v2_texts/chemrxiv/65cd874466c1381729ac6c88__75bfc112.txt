Description:
Contributes to the polymer's mechanical strength and chemical resilience.

Text:
of ethylene 
moieties enhances both flexibility and resistance to low temperatures, whereas the 
presence of acrylonitrile units (comprising up to 87 in P1) contributes to the 
polymers mechanical strength and chemical resilience. The characteristic aliphatic 
resonance observed from 2.88 to 3.13 ppm was ascribed to protons H(b, e) situated 
proximal to the cyano groups. In contrast to the monomer, the aliphatic resonance 
typically around 4.794.71 ppm assigned to He became undetectable. Organic 
elemental analysis (EA) quantified the elemental constituents of the polymers (C 
69.97, H 6.71, N 23.31), mirroring the calculated percentages for the repeating 
unit. Verification of the cyano group in the polymer was corroborated by its 13C NMR 
signature, presenting chemical shifts at 121.6 and 121.4 ppm.
