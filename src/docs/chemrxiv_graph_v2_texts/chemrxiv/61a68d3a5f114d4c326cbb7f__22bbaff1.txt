Description:
A compound for which selectivity is influenced by catalytic systems.

Text:
A continual challenge in this direction 
is to develop both an understanding of the reaction process and factors that dictate H2O2 
selectivity, as well as the continual development of effective catalytic systems. In general noble metals,2 transition metalbased materials,3 and carbon nanostructures4 
have emerged as promising H2O2 selective catalysts with each possessing their advantages and 
drawbacks. One recurrent theme is the importance of identifying of the most active catalytic 
motifs within catalysts that possess a wide variety of surface terminations and possible active 
sites.

Description:
Achieves near 100 Faradaic efficiency with NiAmineMON.

Text:
We show how subtle differences in 
the Ni electronic structure conferred through changes in linker identity led to significant changes 
in H2O2 selectivity, with the NiAmineMON exhibiting near 100 Faradaic efficiency (FE) 
towards H2O2. Finally, we translate the catalyst from a conventional 3electrode setup to a gas
diffusion electrode (GDE)  based reactor and attain industriallyrelevant H2O2 partial current 
densities of 200 mAcm2 while keeping an 85 FE for H2O2.
