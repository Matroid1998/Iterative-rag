Description:
React with arylmethylsulfones in nucleophilic aromatic substitution to form arylthioether adducts.

Text:
Recently, our group introduced the thiolmethylsulfonylbased reaction as a covalent and 
cytocompatible crosslinking strategy for cell encapsulation.7 It is based on the nucleophilic 
aromatic substitution of arylmethylsulfones (MS) by thiols to yield arylthioether adducts, with 
the release of a methylsulfonate anion as leaving group. In this system, where aryl  phenyl
