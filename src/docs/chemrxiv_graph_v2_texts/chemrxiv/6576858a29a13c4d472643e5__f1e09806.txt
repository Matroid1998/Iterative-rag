Dopamine is known to
have a total of 5 receptors which are divided into two main functional categories. Although a great deal of research has been conducted on the effect of THC on dopamine, the amount of research
conducted on the influence of THC on dopamine receptors is limited. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the
relationship between THC and D1 receptors. CB1 Receptors
