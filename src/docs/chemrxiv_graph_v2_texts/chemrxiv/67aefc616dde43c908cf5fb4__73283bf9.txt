Description:
A rare earth element commonly incorporated in apatite in magmatic-metamorphic rocks.

Incorporation of rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in apatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH,Cl,F)2) has been 
extensively studied in the past decades, when it was recognized that this mineral is the dominant host 
for REY in common magmaticmetamorphic rocks.1,2 This topic has attracted renewed attention 
recently37 after the discovery in 2011 of deepsea muds rich in REY in the Pacific Ocean,8 and the 
further identification in 2014 of fluorapatite (FAp) as their main host phase.9 REY enrichment can reach 
oregrade in FAp, and therefore marine deposits are considered a potential resource for strategic REY 
used in industrial and technological applications, such as permanent magnets, electronic equipment 
and catalysis.10 Knowing the crystal chemistry of REY in FAp would help us unravel the geochemical 
formation conditions of this georesource and may help develop efficient extraction processes.
