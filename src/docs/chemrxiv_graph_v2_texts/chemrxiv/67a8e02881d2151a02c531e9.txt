Description:
Exhibits interband photoluminescence when exposed to intense light ranging from 300 nm to 515 nm.

Text:
In a foundational 1969 study, Mooradian documented the first account of interband PL
(Figure 1a when exposing gold and copper to intense light ranging from 300 nm to 515 nm.1
This emission pathway consists of the excitation of electrons from the dband to the con
duction band (violet arrow), followed by the radiative direct interband recombination of the
remaining holes with conduction band electrons below the Fermi level (blue arrow).1,32 Inter
band PL is characterized by a peak near the excitation wavelength that decreases in intensity
and levels out at longer wavelengths.1,2,5,32,33 The fast nonradiative recombination of dband
