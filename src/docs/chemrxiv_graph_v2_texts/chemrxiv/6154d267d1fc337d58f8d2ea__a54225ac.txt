Description:
A neurotoxic natural product that acts as a selective blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels.

Text:
Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxic natural product that has inspired and empowered 
chemists and biologists for more than a century.13 As a selective blocker of voltagegated 
sodium channels, it has played a crucial role in the elucidation of the action potential, and 
it is still routinely used to silence excitable cells in neural systems. Its widespread 
occurrence in aquatic animals, such as pufferfish, starfish, sea snails, octopi, and even in 
newts, has prompted intense investigations into its true biological producers, its 
biosynthesis, and its ecological role.
