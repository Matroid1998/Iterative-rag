Description:
An atom that can serve as a surface termination in MXenes.

Text:
MXenes are a class of 2D transition metal carbides
andor nitrides1 that have gained considerable attention
in recent years. MXene is produced by selectively remov
ing certain layers from the Mn1AXnTx, known as MAX
structure phase, (where n  1, 2, or 3; M is a transition
metal like Sc, Ti, Cr; A is primarily made up of elements
from group IIIA or IVA like Al; X is C or N; and T is the
surface termination including O, OH, andor F atoms)
to create a singlelayered material.
