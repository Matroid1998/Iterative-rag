Materials known for their catalytic properties and use as support materials.

Carbon nitrides have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their catalytic properties and as 
support materials among others.15 By comparison with other allotropes, graphitic carbon nitride (g
C3N4) has a smaller bandgap, which is proposed to result from the conjugated planar structure, akin to 
graphite.6,7 gC3N4 has thus found widespread application in electro and photocatalytic applications,8
12 while its metalation can generate socalled Single Atom Catalysts (SACs), that have further broadened 
the range of catalytic applications.1320 In general, metal sites have been introduced by two different 
approaches i) postsynthetic modification, where a metal salt is impregnated on the gC3N4 material 
followed by reduction andor thermal treatment, or ii) addition of a metal salt during the calcination
