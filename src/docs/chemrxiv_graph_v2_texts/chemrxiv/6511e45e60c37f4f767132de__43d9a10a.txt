Description:
A solvent critical for reactions showing pronounced solvent dependence.

Text:
To construct the eastern 
fragment 4, enantioenriched 9 (937 er) was prepared in good yield 
on multigramscale in two steps, leveraging the multicomponent 
asymmetric aziridination developed by Wulff group (see SI for 
experimental detail).27 With ample quantities of free aziridine 9 in 
hand, a stereo and regio selective aziridine opening reaction was 
conducted using histidine derivative 11 as a nucleophile under 
acidic conditions. This reaction was subjected to extensive 
optimization (see Scheme 1 Table 1 and SI for further detail) and 
showed a pronounced solvent dependence, wherein the use of 
trifluoroethanol (TFE) was found to be critical.
