Description:
A catalyst designed with a more reactive guest element and a more inert host element.

The tailored alloy materials might also substitute or reduce the
use of rare and expensive metal elements in the catalysts while retaining the performance of
the catalysts. One of the straightforward ways to tailor such catalysts is by coating a host
material or nanoparticle with a catalytically active guest metal 1618. Often, the catalysts are designed by a more reactive guest element and a more inert host
element, e.g. PtRu 19,20, PtAu 21, AgRh 22, and PdCu 23. The performance of alloy catalysts
can be estimated employing descriptors and scaling relations18,24, where the local reactivity
can be identied by the adsorption energy of probe molecules 6,25,26.
