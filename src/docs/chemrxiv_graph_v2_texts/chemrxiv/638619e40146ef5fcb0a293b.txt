Description:
An additive used to stabilize electrolytes against oxidation.

Text:
This high redox potential of 4.2 
V vs. NaNa0 (or equivalent to 4.53 V vs. LiLi0) creates severe issues of electrolyte oxidation that 
could further trigger parasitic reactions, especially at a high temperature of 55 C.6,8 We have 
previously shown that one way to alleviate this issue involves stabilizing the electrolyte against 
oxidation or reduction via several additives.8,1416 For instance, by adding vinylene carbonate, 
sodium oxalatodifluoroborate, succinonitrile, and trimethyl silyl phosphite (VC  NaODFB SN  
TMSPi) to the control (1M NaPF6 in ECPCDMC) electrolyte,8,16 we could drastically reduce but 
not fully eliminate the capacity loss at 55 C. Thus, improving further the hightemperature
