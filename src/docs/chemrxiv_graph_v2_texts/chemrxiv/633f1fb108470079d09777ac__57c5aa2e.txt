Description:
A class of antifungal compounds that are prominent macrocyclic compounds.

Text:
Macrocycles occupy a unique segment of drugrelevant chemical space, yet they are relatively 
underexplored compared to acyclic small molecules.1 They represent a privileged class of 
molecules for the modulation of proteinprotein interactions,2, 3 and interest in macrocyclic 
peptides as a class has been growing in both academic and industrial circles.36 Natural 
compounds have been the main source of macrocycles with relevance for therapeutic purposes. While there are over 100 marketed macrocyclic drugs derived from natural sources,7 they are for 
the vast majority either the actual natural compounds, or their modifications. Between 2014 and 
2021, nineteen of the FDA approved drugs are macrocycles,8 which represents roughly 1 in 20 
FDA approvals. Macrolide antibiotics9, 10 such as actinomycin11 and polyene antifungal compounds12 are among 
the most prominent classes of compounds.
