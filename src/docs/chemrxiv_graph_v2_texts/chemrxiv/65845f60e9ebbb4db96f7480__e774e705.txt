Description:
Undergo double allylic substitution employing dual catalysis.

Text:
During this process, ringopening of the 
transient cyclic orthoester would result in the formation of an allylic 
acetate, which could sequentially undergo a classical TsujiTrost 
reaction in the presence of a palladium catalyst. This dual 
catalysis approach would solve the problems of chemoselectivity 
inherent to double allylic substitutions. Nevertheless, this raises 
the question of catalyst compatibility between the Lewis acid and 
Pd catalysts.10 The regioselectivity of each substitution will also 
be a key challenge for this double transformation. Herein, we present a novel method for the double allylic 
substitution of alkenylvicdiols, employing dual catalysis (Lewis 
acidtransition metal). This approach enables the introduction of 
two distinct nucleophiles, providing direct access to complex 
molecular scaffolds. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023c9525v2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000279090234 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
