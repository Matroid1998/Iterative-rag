Description:
Pollutants that can be targeted for removal using biopolymers and their composites.

The advancement of biopolymers provides a pathway towards attaining environmental 
sustainability through the reduction of dependence on nonrenewable fossil fuels.13 Biopolymers 
(e.g., cellulose, chitin, and their derivatives) are known for their abundance, biocompatibility, 
biodegradability, and nontoxicity.14 Biopolymers and their synthesized composites can be 
developed for targeted removal of various pollutants such as organic dyes, 
pesticidesherbicides, pharmaceuticals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, 
radioactive substances, and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances.4 The ability of biopolymers to 
be modified for improved functionally allows for the optimization of performance and the 
mitigation of specific contaminants.15 Chitin has been explored as a precursor for alternative to 
petroleumbased ion exchange resins in numerous studies.4,16,17 Despite the widespread 
interest in developing and testing biopolymers for ion exchange, only a handful of studies have 
assessed the sustainability of these beads as an alternative to synthetic polymers in water 
treatment.14,18 Thus, a need exists to characterize the costs and environmental impacts of 
chitosan derived biopolymeric beads to develop sustainable water treatment methods.
