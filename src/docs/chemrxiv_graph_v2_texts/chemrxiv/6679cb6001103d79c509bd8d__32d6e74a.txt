Description:
Used in sodiumion batteries, a promising energy storage technology.

Text:
Sodiumion batteries (SIBs) are currently being commercialized and are seen as a 
promising energy storage technology based on more abundant, noncritical elements 
while achieving energy densities close to those of Liion batteries (LIBs).1 A straight
forward approach for increasing the energy density of SIBs with layered oxides as 
cathode active materials (CAMs) is to increase the charging cutoff voltage.2 
Extending the upper cutoff potential beyond 4 V vs. NaNa will therefore in most 
cases result in a significantly higher storage capacity and hence higher energy density.3 
However, a too high charging voltage causes poor cycle life due to degradation of the 
electrode materials andor electrolyte decomposition.4 To overcome these issues, a 
fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanism of cathode materials at 
high voltages (above 4.0 V vs NaNa) is essential.
