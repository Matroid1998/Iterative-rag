Description:
A late transition metal where adsorption is generally weakened when moving right in the periodic table.

Text:
Scaling and BEP relations have had an immense impact on catalysis theory.14 The observation that 
adsorption in general is weakened by moving right (from Mn to Cu) and down from 3d to 5d 
among the late transition metals can be rationalized by the dband model.5,6 Since any molecule 
binds weaker going right and down in the periodic table, the binding of the different molecules must 
all be correlated. It turns out that there often are linear relations between adsorption energies of 
different molecules, the socalled scaling relations.7,8 Scaling and BEP relations relate the energies 
for the states along the reaction path to each other. This means that if you want a low barrier for e.g.
