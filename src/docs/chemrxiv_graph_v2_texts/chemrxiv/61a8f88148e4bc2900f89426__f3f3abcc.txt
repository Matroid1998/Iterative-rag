Description:
Bond distances empirically correlate to their vibrational frequencies with force constants increasing monotonically with decreasing bond length.

Text:
Da Re et al. emphasize the unique challenges in dichromium
complexes by comparing the empirical force constants and bond distances for rst and second
row transition metals. For example, Mo(II)Mo(II) bond distances empirically correlate to their
vibrational frequencies, as expected, with force constants increasing monotonically with decreas
