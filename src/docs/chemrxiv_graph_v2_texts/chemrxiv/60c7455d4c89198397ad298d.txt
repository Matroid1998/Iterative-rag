Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds that are crucial for intermolecular interactions and structures.

Due to the rapid developments of technologies related to terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, quick 
and precise measurements have become possible in the THz frequency region (0.1  10 THz or 3 
 333 cm1), in which organic materials show characteristic spectra (socalled fingerprint 
spectra).1,2 Since those absorption bands are mainly due to the intermolecular vibrational 
motion,3,4 THz spectroscopy provides detailed information about intermolecular structures and 
intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bondings.58 Especially for macromolecules, THz 
spectra give direct information about higher order conformation and hydrogen bonding networks, 
all of which play an important role for their physical and chemical properties. Therefore, THz 
spectroscopy is poised to become a powerful tool for research in polymer science.
