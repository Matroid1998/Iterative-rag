Description:
Used in adsorbent beds as a less energy-intensive prepurification system.

Cryogenic liquefaction or distillation is currently the mainstream tech
nique to achieve industrial gas separation, while adsorbent beds made of nanoporous materi
als (activated alumina or zeolites) are mostly used as a less energyintensive prepurification
system.1
A wider use of nanoporous materials could reduce the energy consumption of current
separation processes since adsorption is way less energy intensive than liquefaction.2 For
instance, some prototypes involving beds of nanoporous materials have been developed for
xenonkrypton separation to avoid employing cryogenic distillation.3 For the process to be
viable, materials need to perform even better and many studies focus on synthesizing ever
more selective materials by leveraging all chemical intuitions around noble gas adsorption
properties.46 In order to speed the discovery process of novel materials with key proper
ties, computational screening can identify factors explaining the performance and preselect
candidates for further experimental studies.
