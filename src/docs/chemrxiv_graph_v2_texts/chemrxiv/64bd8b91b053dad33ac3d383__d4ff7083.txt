Description:
An additive that improves the cycle life and charge acceptance of batteries.

Text:
Carbon materials are outstanding because many recent studies show the advantages of its 
inclusion in the LAB 10,11. Carbon as an additive to NAM is positive because it improves 
the cycle life of batteries and the charge acceptance during operation. The higher durability 
with a higher number of battery dischargecharge cycles makes LAB competitive with other, 
more expensive ones. The benefits are especially important for a highrate partial state of 
charge (HRPSoC) regime, as in the commercial startstop batteries 12. Current collectors 
made of carbon are of great interest 13. The high carbon surface area increases the contact
