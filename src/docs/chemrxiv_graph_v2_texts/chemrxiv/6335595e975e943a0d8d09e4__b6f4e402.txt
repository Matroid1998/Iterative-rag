Description:
Catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)2 in reaction path investigations.

Text:
have developed a predictive
model based on DFTcomputed electrostatic and orbital properties of the neutral or cationic
alkenecatalyst complexes which they test on eight dierent alkenes. They use a very simpli
ed model of the Pd catalyst (PdIPH3 and Pd(PH3)2 for the neutral and cationic pathway,
respectively) and the aryl group is replaced by ethene, but still they get a good agreement
with the experimentally observed regioselectivities. Bcktorp and Norrby investigated the entire reaction paths for both the neutral and
cationic mechanisms of styrene and phenyl chloride catalysed by Pd(PPh3)2, including the
two neutral paths depending on whether the chloride is cis or trans to the phenyl ring (Ph)
when complexed with the catalyst (Figure 2).
