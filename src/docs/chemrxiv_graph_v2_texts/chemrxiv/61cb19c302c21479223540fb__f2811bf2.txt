Description:
Surfaces that interact with O2 molecules in hot atom dynamics.

Text:
As far as simu
lations are concerned, in recent years signicant progress
has been made by performing dynamical simulations that
include the coupling either to a phonon bath 15, 1721
or to electronhole pairs 2224. Such simulations have
provided very valuable insights into hot atom dynamics
in reactions Gambardella2001 at surfaces. Still it is fair
to say that there is not yet a general understanding about
the factors promoting hot atom reactions at surfaces. In this study, I will demonstrate that hot atom dynam
ics plays a critical role in the interaction of O2 molecules
with stepped Pt surfaces.
