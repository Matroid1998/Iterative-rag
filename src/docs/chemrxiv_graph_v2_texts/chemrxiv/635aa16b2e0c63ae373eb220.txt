Description:
Considered as a carbon-free molecule for energy and matter storage.

Text:
More efficient catalysts are needed to 
render desired energy conversion and storage in the re
quired large scales, to close the carbon cycle in the use of 
fossil raw materials, and to apply alternative carbonfree 
molecules such as ammonia for storage of energy and mat
ter.14 However, the description and modeling of catalysis 
and the design of catalysts is challenged by the intricate in
terplay of numerous, not fully understood underlying pro
cesses that governs this materials function, such as the sur
face bondbreaking and forming reactions, the restructur
ing of the material under the catalytic reaction environ
ment, and the transport of molecules and energy across ex
tremely different length and time scales.
