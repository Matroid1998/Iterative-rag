Description:
A dinuclear metal carbonyl complex studied for catalysis.

Text:
A class of dinuclear complexes that have been studied extensively 
for catalysis in the past are dinuclear metal carbonyl complexes 
such as Fe2(CO)9 and Co2(CO)8.11 For example, Co2(CO)8 is used as 
catalyst for hydroformylation industrially.12,13 In addition, it has also 
been 
shown 
to 
perform 
reduction 
reactions 
such 
as 
hydrosilylation.14,15 However, even though Co2(CO)8 is a dinuclear 
precatalyst, the important intermediates that are found in the 
hydrosilylation mechanism of this compound are mononuclear.15 
There are few examples in the literature of welldefined dicobalt 
silane complexes, even though these are of interest for studying 
their relevance in catalytic reduction reactions.
