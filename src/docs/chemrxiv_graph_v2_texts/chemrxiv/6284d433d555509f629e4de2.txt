Description:
A catalyst used in the activation of carbon-oxygen bonds in phenol derivatives for coupling reactions.

Text:
To address this, we built a literaturemined, openaccess reaction dataset that focuses on
the Nicatalyzed CO bond activation to form CC and CN bonds the NiCOlit dataset.16
It gathers more than two thousand peerreviewed reactions with detailed experimental
conditions. As a singular literature representative dataset, NiCOlit stands as a benchmark
for machine learning prediction of chemical yields found in published reaction data. II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Description of NiCOlit
NiCOlit was manually extracted from published reaction data cited in a recent review from
Diao and coworkers17. In this review, the authors focus on the activation of carbonoxygen
bonds of phenol derivatives with nickel catalysts for coupling reactions.
