Description:
A safer trimethylsilyl derivative of diazomethane, whose use was limited after a lethal incident.

In 
particular, the enthalpy of decomposition of diazomethane 
amounts to ca 5450 kJkg15 and is comparable with mod
ern explosives (RDX 6125 kJkg).16 Previously, the CH2N2 
based transformations both in laboratory and industry 
were performed via the safer trimethylsilylderivative 
Me3SiCHN2, but in 2011, after the 2008s lethal case, the use 
of this reagent was also significantly limited.17 In recent 
years, CH2N2 and other nonstabilized diazo compounds, are 
experiencing a renaissance due to achievements in flow 
technology.18 In fact, the discovery of HIV protease inhibi
tors 
nelfinavir, 
amprenavir, 
atazanavir, 
palinanavir, 
saquinavir and darunavir has given an impulse to adapta
tion of the diazomethanebased syntheses to industrial rou
tines, as chiral aminoalcohol moieties in their structure can 
be introduced via AADDK derivatives (Figure 1, B and C).19 
In addition, a similar chiral fragment has been used recently 
in the design of 3CL protease inhibitor of SARS CoV2.20 
The first attempts of industrial AADDK synthesis have 
been made by Phoenix Chemicals Ltd in 2002.21 A pilot 
semiflow reactor for the CH2N2 generation from Diazald 
(NmethylN(ptolylsulfonyl)nitrosamide) has been devel
oped with the purpose to avoid the worstcase scenario the 
explosion of diazomethane.
