Description:
Used in nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) for controlled polymerization techniques.

Text:
The industrial demand for novel synthetic materials with specific properties is constantly 
growing. From an academic point of view, this has resulted in tremendous effort being put into 
the research and development of new methods of polymerization that yield polymers with 
tailored structures and the desired properties. Preparation of polymers with controlled 
architectures can be achieved by making use of controlled polymerization12 techniques such as 
ionic polymerization, nitroxidemediated polymerization (NMP), atom transfer radical 
polymerization (ATRP), and lately, (RAFT) reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer 
polymerization.3 Of all these methods, RAFT polymerization is often reported as being the most

versatile, as it is fairly tolerant to impurities and can be used with a wide range of monomers.
