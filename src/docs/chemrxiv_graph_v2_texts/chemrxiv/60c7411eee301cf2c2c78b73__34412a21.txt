Description:
Used to prepare thin films to investigate properties as electron transport materials.

These nonplanar
cyclic conjugated systems have largely attracted the attention of theoretical and
experimental groups, due to their unique electronic and optical properties and po
tential applications in Organic Electronics.1,2 In fact, these systems present variable
emission spectra and quantum yields as a function of their size, in contrast with
linear analogues.3 For instance, 10CPP and some tetraalkoxy derivatives were used
very recently to prepare thinlms in order to investigate their properties as electron
transport materials.4 In the eld of supramolecular chemistry, 10CPP is able to form
a supramolecular concaveconvex stacking complex with C60 fullerenes in solution5
and solidstate,6 which can be further exploited to realize selfassembled functional
materials.
