The 
development 
of 
costeffective, 
sustainable 
and 
environmentalfriendly energy conversion and storage devices is 
a key path towards carbon neutrality.13 Rechargeable zincair 
batteries (ZABs) are amongst the most promising battery 
technologies as they combine high energy density (theoretical 
limit 1086 Wh kg1), economic viability and feasible scaleup.46 
However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction 
(ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) result in high 
overpotentials and unsatisfactory efficiency, thereby causing 
major roadblocks in the development of ZABs.7,8 While noble 
metalbased catalysts might address some of these issues, their 
scarcity and high cost prohibit largescale commercialization.9,10 
Thus, the development of highly efficient and robust bifunctional 
ORROER electrocatalysts based on earthabundant elements is 
a grand challenge in sustainable energy research.11 
Recently, single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as 
promising alternatives to noble metal catalysts.12,13 In SACs, 
transition metal atoms (especially Fe, Co, Ni and Mn) are 
anchored on electroactive matrices, e.g.

carbon, often by 
coordination to dopant elements such as nitrogen, resulting in 
various MNC species.14,15 These materials offer unique 
advantages including strong metalsubstrate interactions,16 
tunable electronic structure of the active metal site as well as high 
electric conductivity, often resulting in excellent redoxcatalytic 
performance.1719 Also, the quasimolecular design of these 
materials enable optimum metalatom utilization and enable 
rational active site design at the atomic level.19,20 
However, particularly for ORR, monometallic SACs (often based 
on Fe, Co) are limited by unfavorable energetics for the binding 
of key oxygen intermediates (O2 and OOH), resulting in high O2 
activation barriers.19 In addition, monometallic SACs often show 
high overpotentials for the OER reaction, as water oxidation is 
favored at polynuclear species.20 
One promising strategy to overcome these challenges is the 
introduction of a second metal center, resulting in dual atom
