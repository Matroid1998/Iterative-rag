Description:
A gas that can be captured or released through electrode charging processes.

CO2 (aq.) H2O (l)  H2CO3  (aq.) H2CO3  (aq.) H2O (l)  HCO3 (aq.) H3O (aq.) HCO3 (aq.) H2O (l)  CO32 (aq.) H3O (aq.) In our recent study, we found that when the gasexposed working electrode was charged 
negatively, CO2 capture was observed, while when the gasexposed working electrode was 
charged positively, CO2 release was observed (Figure 1).17 We hypothesized that the negative 
charging process causes bicarbonate ions (HCO3) to migrate away from the gasexposed 
working electrode and leads to a local depletion of CO2 which then drives CO2 capture (Figure 
1a). In contrast, we proposed that the positive charging process accumulates HCO3 ions on the 
gasexposed working electrode and thereby drives CO2 release (Figure 1b). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023nj817v2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000193897993 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
