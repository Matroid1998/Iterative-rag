Description:
Involved in the evolution process affecting voltage decay in lithium-ion battery materials.

Text:
Li and Mnrich (LMR) nickel, manganese, and cobalt oxides as positive electrodes for
lithiumion batteries promise improved material cost and energy density over conventional
layered oxides.1 Their high capacity and sustainable compositions, consisting predominantly
of abundant Mn, with minority of Ni and little to no Co (20 mol metals basis) are ap
pealing. However, issues of voltage fade,27 gas release,3,6 slow kinetics,3,6,7 and low density7
remain critical bottlenecks. Various strategies to improve LMR performance have been investigated.810 These in
clude coating1,1115 as well as modifications to bulk compositions, such as increasing nickel
concentration to prevent voltage decay upon oxygen evolution.16 Modifications to the TM
precursor have been leveraged to tune the morphology of the synthesized material10,1721 as
