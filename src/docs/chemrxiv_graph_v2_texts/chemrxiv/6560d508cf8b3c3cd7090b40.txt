Description:
A protective group that can be removed to reveal hydroxyl functionalities.

of the C3methyl substituent by kinetic 
deprotonation and trapping with MeI to give 35. Acetonide 
removal and hydride reduction directed by the C3OH 
furnished triol 36. Global methylation and benzyl 
deprotection by catalytic transfer hydrogenation gave 3. Synthesis of the nogalamine fragment 4 began with Noyori 
asymmetric reduction of achiral 37 to give 38, followed by 
oxidative ring expansion via an Achmatowicz reaction to 
yield dihydropyranone 39 (Scheme 4C).43 Tangs chiral 
catalystdirected acylation and Pdcatalyzed glycosidation 
strategies afforded intermediate 41 as an 81 mixture of  
anomers.44 Luche reduction, epoxidation and ringopening 
with HNMe2 afforded 43 in 16 yield over the threestep 
sequence. A final debenzylation is all that is required for the 
nogalamine sugar 4, but at this stage, the alcohol was left 
protected as the benzyl ether.
