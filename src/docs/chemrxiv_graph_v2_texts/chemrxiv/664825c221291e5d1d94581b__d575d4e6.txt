Description:
A drug used for treating leishmaniasis with disadvantages including toxicity and high cost.

Text:
L. amazonensis is the main causative agent of TL in the Americas.9 
48 
TL can cause skin lesions that may either selfheal or progress to disfiguring scars and can extensively 
49 
destroy nasopharyngeal mucosal tissues.10 Diagnosing and treating TL early is difficult because the 
50 
disease evolves slowly and covers large skin areas.10 Moreover, the drugs that are available for treating 
51 
leishmaniasis (e.g., pentavalent antimmonials, amphotericin B, pentamidine, miltefosine, and 
52 
paramomycin) have disadvantages that include toxicity, high cost, and emergence of parasitic resistance.11 
53 
Several compounds with pharmacological activities, such as bronchodilating, anticonvulsant, 
54 
hypertensive, and calcium channel blocking action, bear the 1,4dihydropyridine nucleus (1,4DHP).12 
55 
These compounds are also known for their ability to reverse multidrug resistance.13.
