Description:
Generated undesirably in the presence of a water film.

Text:
Particular attention needs to be given to water, as a water film alters the adsorption 
of modifiers 22 and initiates undesired generation of hydrated calcium bicarbonate.15 Therefore, a clean, 
preferably freshly fractured CaCO3 surface with accessible positively charged calcium sites should be 
used for effective surface hydrophobization.2 
In light of the above, the modification should preferably be carried out immediately after surface fracture 
using surfaceactive organic modifiers, e.g. glycols, alcohols, phosphonates, and sulfonates.6 Among 
these organic modifiers, the long chain carboxylic acids, socalled fatty acids, are the most prominent 
ones in use.2, 23 In contrast to the nonadsorbates and weak adsorbates that have slight or no effect on 
the CaCO3 dissolution rates, the fatty acids adsorb strongly to the carbonate surface, isolating it from
