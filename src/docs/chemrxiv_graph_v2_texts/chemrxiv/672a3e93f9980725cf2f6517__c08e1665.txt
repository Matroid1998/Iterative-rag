Description:
A dense impermeable layer that prevents calcium ion diffusion into the pore solution.

Text:
In the model of GoetzNeunhoeffner 10, a dense im
37
permeable Al(OH)x(H2O)y layer is proposed which prevents the calcium ion diffusion into the pore
38
solution. Bertrandie and Barret 31 postulated the transformation of AlO 
2 sites on the CA particle
39
surface into Al(OH)4 ions. This process would form an inert, superficially hydroxylated layer with
40
the composition CaAl(OH)42 immediately after water addition around the CA grain (CAsh). The
41
renewed CAdissolution and precipitation of hydrate phases mark the end of the dormant period and
42
the beginning of the CAC main reaction. After reaching its maximum, the deceleration period sets in,
43
mainly characterized by the hydration of dicalcium monoaluminate (CA2), the second hydraulic CAC
44
phase. Using synthetic CACA2mixes, Klaus et al.
