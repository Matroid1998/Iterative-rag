Description:
The first material to demonstrate ferroelectric capabilities, characterized by piezoelectricity, a high dielectric constant, a high band gap, and low current loss.

As explained by Parmar et al., 2023, the perovskites, materials with chemical formula ABX3 (A and B cations, 
X anion), have the specific features proper for their use in solar cells. Moreover, the oxide perovskite 
semiconductors have outstanding ferroelectric characteristics (Parmar et al., 2023). The first material to ever 
demonstrate ferroelectric capabilities is BaTiO3 barium titanate, which is in the tetragonal phase at a 
temperature of about 120 C and has a special structure known as the ABO3 perovskites crystal (Parmar et 
al., 2023). According to Parmar and coworkers. besides ferroelectricity BaTiO3 is characterized by 
piezoelectricity, and it possesses a high dielectric constant, and a high band gap and low current loss.
