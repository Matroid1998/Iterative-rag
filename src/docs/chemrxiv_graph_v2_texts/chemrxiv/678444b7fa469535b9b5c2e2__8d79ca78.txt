Description:
A compound involved in reduction reactions facilitated by photocatalysts.

Text:
Photocatalysts 1 are materials that facilitate photoreactions under light irradiation, typically by 
absorbing photons and generating electronhole pairs that drive chemical transformations 2. These materials are integral to various applications, including water splitting, carbon dioxide 
reduction, and environmental remediation. In the context of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 
photocatalysts absorb light and utilize the energy to drive the reduction of protons to hydrogen, a 
clean energy carrier. The efficiency of photocatalysts in HER is heavily influenced by their 
electronic structure, light absorption properties, and charge transfer capabilities 3. Therefore, 
enhancing these properties through modifications, such as doping or structural design, has become 
a focal point for improving the performance of photocatalytic materials. One approach to improving photocatalytic activity is through nitrogen doping.
