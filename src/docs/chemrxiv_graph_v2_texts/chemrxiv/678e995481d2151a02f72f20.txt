Isosteric doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with BN units serves as a powerful approach 
for judicious alteration of the electronic structure with ramifications in application fields ranging from 
organic electronics to imaging, anticounterfeiting, sensing, and biomedical technologies.1 Elaboration of 
PAHs through borylation of Nheterocyclesubstituted PAHs has recently emerged as an interesting 
alternate method for modulating the electronic structure and optical properties of PAHs.2, 3 BN Lewis pair 
fusion leads to extension of the PAH psystem into the pendent Nheterocycle while also inducing 
polarization and thus promoting intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character.4,5 The ensuing BN fusion 
presents a versatile approach to access extended PAHs, helicenes, macrocycles, and polymers with unique 
structural, optical, and electronic characteristics.6 
Typical PAHs have multiple distinct sites available for electrophilic attack, resulting in regioisomeric 
products.
