Exhibit rapid rotation adjacent to 6helicene as observed by NMR spectroscopy.

Nevertheless, 
we observed a rapid rotation of the phenylenes adjacent to 
the 6helicene by NMR spectroscopy. This conformational 
change proceeds via a conformer with an orientable sys
tem, i.e., a Hckel conformer, which cannot be directly de
tected by NMR due to its high relative energy. The presence 
of the curved paraphenylene segment in 6,7HPP endowed 
this chiral nanocarbon with unique photophysical proper
ties typical for CPPs and allowed for observation of an 
anomalous circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The 
CPL in 6,7HPP displayed a coexistence of a major and a
