Description:
A gas that can be captured and converted to formic acid.

Text:
This 
MICborane adduct can capture atmospheric CO2, and convert it to formic acid. Investigations of a few 
key intermediates via multi nuclear NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and single crystal Xray 
diffraction allows us to postulate a plausible reaction mechanism. Additionally, a first catalytic cycle for 
this process is presented as well. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20245w7nc ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000348877277 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
