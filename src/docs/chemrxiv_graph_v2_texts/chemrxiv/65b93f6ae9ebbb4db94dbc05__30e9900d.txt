High-purity metal pellets used in various applications.

Text:
Anhydrous 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9), anhydrous N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8) and 
anhydrous lithium fluoride (LiF, 99.99) were purchased from SigmaAldrich. Poly(3,4
ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOTPSS, Clevios Al 4083) was purchased 
from Heraeus. 2,2,2(1,3,5benzinetriyl)tris(1phenyl1Hbenzimidazole) (TPBi, 99.5) and 
1,3,5tri (mpyrid3ylphenyl)benzene (TmPyPB, 99.5) were purchased from Ossila. Al 
(99.99) pellets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company. All chemicals were used directly 
as received. Perovskite precursor 
The perovskite precursor preparation was conducted inside a nitrogenfilled glovebox at room 
temperature. 0.1M PEA2PbCl1Br3 stock solution was prepared by dissolving stoichiometric 
PEACl, PEABr, and PbBr2 in DMSO then left under continuous stirring for 2 hours. The precursor 
solution was then filtered with a 0.22 m PTFE syringe filter before spin coating.
