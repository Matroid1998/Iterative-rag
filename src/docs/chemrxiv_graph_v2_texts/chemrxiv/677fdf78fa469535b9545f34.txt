Description:
Used in plasma to increase the photocatalytic activity of TMC by introducing beneficial surface terminations.

Text:
For example, N2 plasma can increase the photocatalytic activity of TMC by introducing beneficial 
surface terminations.22 Among surface terminations (F, OH, O) of TMC, OH and O have demonstrated 
higher electrical conductivity.23 Lowpower OAr plasma is ideal to realize etching and replacement of the 
surface termination functional groups, converting asfabricated F into OH or O. The mechanisms of O2 
and Ar plasma treatment differ significantly but there is a synergistic amplification effect when using them 
as a mixture. O plasma treatment induces chemical modification as O2 discharges and releases O
