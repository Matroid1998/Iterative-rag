Description:
Used in composites to improve material performance.

Text:
Different strategies have been proposed to cope with this
phenomenon through the use of thin films,12 nanostructures,13,14 carbon composites15,16 or
special binders.17,18 Many of these ideas are based on speculative analysis that addresses
the improvement of the material performance to the nature of the structures prepared,
although a realistic picture based on an atomistic point of view is still missing. 2
