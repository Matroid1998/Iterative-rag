Description:
A layered cathode material widely used in Li-ion batteries.

Electrochemical ion insertion of guest species into host structures is widely used in various 
applications1, including neuromorphic computing2, electrochromic windows3, and, most 
prominently, energy storage4. The ion insertion rate is a critical determinant for important 
performance parameters including switching speed, charging rate, and power density. The ion 
insertion rate strongly depends on two material parameters the solid ion diffusion rate in the bulk, 
and the reaction rate at the electrodeelectrolyte interface5. Therefore, an accurate understanding 
of the diffusion and reaction rate is critically important for designing ion insertion devices. Layered Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O2 (NMC) and Li(Ni,Co,Al)O2 (NCA) are the most widely used 
cathodes for Liion batteries. NMC and NCA secondary particles (10 m) consist of a sintered 
polycrystalline agglomerate of many primary particles, each 100500 nm.
