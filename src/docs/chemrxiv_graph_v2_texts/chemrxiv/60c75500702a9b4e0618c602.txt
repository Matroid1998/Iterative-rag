Description:
Compounds with toxic effects ascribed in part to their membrane-binding and perturbing effects.

membranelipid therapy.3 Indeed, many bioactive compounds and
drug(like) molecules are membraneactive, interacting directly with membrane lipids, mod
ulating its biophysical properties, and eventually triggering subsequent downstream events
that lead to promiscuous cellular alterations.47 This interaction is often concomitant with
specic therapeutical eects3 such as in the case of antimicrobial peptides,810 sugarbased
bactericides11 and other small molecule antibiotics,12 or modulators of multidrug resistance
of tumoral cells.13 Besides therapeutical eects, the interaction of small molecules with mem
branes might also be responsible for their nonspecic toxicity. For instance, the toxic eects
of polyhalogenated biphenyls14 or brominated ame retardants15 were ascribed in part to
their membranebinding and perturbing eects.15,16 Therefore, understanding lipidligand
interactions is paramount not only for designing the abovementioned lipid therapies3 or
