Description:
Used in high performance supercapacitors due to their spinel structure.

Text:
Ternary Metal Oxides (TMO) have received recent investigation for application in photonics due to properties of 
enhanced conductivity, tuneable optoelectronic behaviour and multiple oxidation state of oxygen inducing functional 
diversity such as spinel metalcobalt oxides for high performance supercapacitors or nitrogen doped TMOs inducing adjusted 
band structures for enhanced photocatalytic activity via bandgap reduction for increased optical absorption 1,2. Although 
TMO research has grown, ternary beryllium oxides have been relatively unexplored due to the toxic nature of beryllium 
inducing the chronic lung disease berylliosis and regulatory procedures for material access.
