Description:
A multidentate bridging ligand used in HOIPs.

Text:
HOIPs have recently emerged as efficient 
optoelectronic materials thanks to their valuable utility in to ionic 
transport,1,2 multiferroic3 and photovoltaic applications.47 They 
possess a high chemical and structural variability through the 
replacement of the X species with other multidentate bridging 
ligands such as cyanide CN, thiocyanate SCN, formate HCOO, 
hypophosphite H2POO or dicyanamide dca, N(CN)2, among 
others.811 Careful selection, or modification of the linker andor 
metal cation allows property modulation and enhancement.12 
The extended hybrid connectivity of HOIPs mean that they share 
many similarities with metalorganic frameworks (MOFs).1315 
However, HOIPs are considerably more dense than MOFs given the 
presence of the Asite cation, which means they are typically unable 
to selectively adsorb guest species.16 Accordingly, interest in their 
behaviour does not revolve around porosity, but instead 
concentrates on ionic conductivity,1 ferroelectric17 and barocaloric18 
properties.
