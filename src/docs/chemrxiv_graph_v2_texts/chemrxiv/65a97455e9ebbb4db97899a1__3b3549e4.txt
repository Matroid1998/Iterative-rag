Description:
Displayed stoichiometric and catalytic transfer reactivity with a dinickel complex.

In a collaborative study, the groups of Tilley 
and Scheer reported how the dinucleating naphthyridine based 
DPFN ligand can stabilize such a welldefined dicopper complex 
featuring a bridging Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) (Figure 1).17 
Although the reactivity of this complex is not described, one would 
not expect carbene transfer chemistry given the NHCs stabilized 
nature.18 A welldefined dinuclear complex bearing a less stabilized 
carbene was reported by the group of Uyeda, albeit with a different 
transition metal (Figure 1).19 Although no carbene transfer to 
alkenes was found using this dinickel complex, it did display 
stoichiometric and catalytic transfer reactivity to isocyanides.
