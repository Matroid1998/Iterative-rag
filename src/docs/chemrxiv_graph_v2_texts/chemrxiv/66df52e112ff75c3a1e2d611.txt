Description:
A compound used in photoswitches with applications in molecular electronics, light-controlled catalysis, and chemical biology.

Text:
The isomerization of azobenzene and its derivatives (Azo) has remained topical since the 1930s.1 
The number of potential advanced applications of azobenzene photoswitches2 is still growing,3 
ranging from molecular electronics,4 through lightcontrolled catalysis,5 and photoactuators,6 to 
chemical biology7,8 and beyond.9 Such a dynamic advancement demands constant development of
