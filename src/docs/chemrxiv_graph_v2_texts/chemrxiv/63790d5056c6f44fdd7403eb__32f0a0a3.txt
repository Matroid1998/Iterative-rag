Description:
An aliphatic polyester used in industrial applications and as a building block for biodegradable plastics.

Text:
Poly(butylene adipate) (PBA) aliphatic polyester is mainly used in 
industrial applications, for example as a building block of poly(butylene adipateco
terephthalate) (PBAT) commercially known as Ecoflex (BASF), which is marketed as fully 
biodegradable plastic 15. Interestingly enough, PBA copolymerization with different 
comonomers also led to novel biomedical materials showing both biodegradability and good 
biocompatibility. They were already evaluated as drug delivery systems 16 and performed in 
vitro release studies indicated controlled release patterns connected with both drug diffusion 
and polymer degradation, where the degradation profile was moderated by PBA content within 
copolymer structure. Other interesting components for the preparation of biodegradable PNPs 
are fatty acids (FA) as hydrophobic compounds naturally occurring in the human body which 
may retain hydrophobic drugs due to hydrophobic interactions.
