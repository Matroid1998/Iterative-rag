Description:
Functionalized compounds synthesized through silicon effect-induced processes.

Text:
However, the siliconeffectinduced 
functionalization of allyl silanes primarily targets unsatu
rated double bonds, resulting in double bond migration and 
extensive desilylation owing to the susceptibility of silicon 
groups to nucleophilic attack (left, Scheme 1a).9,10 While of
fering substantial promise for the synthesis of functional
ized organosilanes, direct allylic CH functionalization of al
lyl silanes enabled by silicon effects remain largely under
explored,14,15 probably due to its propensity to undergo 
transmetalation with transition metal CH activation cata
lysts, and the higher reactivity of the activated  system 
(right, Scheme 1a).
