On the other hand, the ammonia oxidation reaction
(AOR) allows us to electrochemically convert captured
ammonia into NH4NO3 salts, providing the opportunity to
increase gross profits and sustainability of the process.5
Since some AOR catalysts materials, including Ptbased cat
alysts and nickel oxides and hydroxides, have demonstrated
selectivity toward N2 formation through reaction 1,6,7 it
becomes critical to understand how the nature of the catalyst
surface controls selectivity in order to design an AOR
catalyst to convert ammonia into fertilizer.

Description:
A product of selective formation on Pt and Ir transition metals.

Text:
Many single and multimetal catalysts on a wide variety
of supports have been explored experimentally to understand
how altering the catalyst could potentially help control path
way selectivity.810 For transition metals, N2 formation has
been shown to be selective on Pt and Ir.11 For other platinum
group metals including Rh, Ru, and Pd, they adsorb nitrogen
species much more strongly than Pt, which results in faster
catalyst deactivation.11,12 Coinage metals are on the other
extreme of this spectrum, with low affinity for N, and thus
making them inactive for N2 production.11,12 As for multi
metal systems, it has been shown that IrRh nanoparticles
