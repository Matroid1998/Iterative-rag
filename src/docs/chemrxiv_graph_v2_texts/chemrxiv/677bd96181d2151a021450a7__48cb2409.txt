Description:
A component of CALF20, a zinc-based MOF known for its hydrophobicity and robust structural integrity.

Text:
MOFs are a class of hybrid nanoporous crystalline materials that are constructed of metal ions or clusters connected 
by organic linkers using modular building principles.13 MOFs have attracted much attention as potential 
adsorbents for CO2 capture due to their high surface area, tuneable pore size and shape, adjustable functionality, 
and structural diversity.1416 Different approaches are proposed for enhancing CO2 capture in MOFs including the 
introduction of coordinative unsaturated metal sites, amine functionalization, modulation of hydrophobicity of the 
pores, and the mixture thereof.14,1618 At the forefront of this strive is CALF20 (Zn), a zincbased MOF, first 
reported by Shimizu et al.,19 distinguished by its hydrophobicity, high scalability, and robust structural integrity. With a surface area of ca.

Description:
Demonstrates a remarkable capacity and selective CO2 adsorption.

Text:
530 mg19,20 and an average pore size of 67 2022, CALF20 (Zn) demonstrates a 
remarkable capacity and selective CO2 adsorption23 at desired conditions.21 Its unique framework, composed of 
1,2,4triazole and oxalate ligands confers stability in harsh environments.21 The necessity of capturing CO2 under 
fluctuating conditions is emphasized by the varying concentrations of CO2 found in diverse industrial emissions 
and atmospheric contexts. CALF20 (Zn) exhibits exceptional versatility in maintaining operational efficacy 
across a range of temperatures and pressures, positioning it as an indispensable tool in global efforts to mitigate
