Description:
A 13C15N labelled compound used in solid-state NMR experiments.

Text:
We first evaluate the approach by performing 13C detected solidstate NMR 
experiments on a 13C15N labelled methionineleucinephenylalanine (MLF) powder sample in 
combination with simulations of polarization transfer dynamics. Next, we show that by using DIPSI3 
for 13C13C mixing in triple sensitivityenhanced 4D hCXCANH and hCXCAcoNH experiments (CX 
represents aliphatic carbon sidechains) we can obtained high quality spectra suitable for side chain 
assignments in a challenging 30 kDa membrane protein sample, fulllength GlpG, in a few days. GlpG 
is a rhomboid protease that cleaves its substrates within the cell membrane. We have previously 
investigated the structure and dynamics related to the gating mechanism and inhibitor binding in a 
truncated version of GlpG (GlpGN)1720, where the cytosolic domain has been removed.
