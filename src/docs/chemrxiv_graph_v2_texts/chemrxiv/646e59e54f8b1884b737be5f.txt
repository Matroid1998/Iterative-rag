Description:
Forms fibers that are traditionally strong and used in structural applications.

Additional strain and nonlinear response can be achieved 
through various methods, including reorientation of offaxis fibers and matrix shearing through angle 
plies,11, 12 excess length via outofplane waviness,13, 14 highly aligned discontinuous fibers,15, 16 or 
shear under tension in a biaxial braid structure.17, 18 However, braided composites typically do not 
exhibit an increase in stress after the initial failure, making true pseudoductility unattainable with 
such architecture. Promising ductile fibers, such as carbon nanotubes 19 and regenerated cellulose, 20 
have been identified. However, these new fibers are unable to provide elastic moduli and strength 
values comparable to those of traditional glass or carbon fibers, making the commercialization of 
ductile composites for macroscale structural applications a challenging and timeconsuming process.
