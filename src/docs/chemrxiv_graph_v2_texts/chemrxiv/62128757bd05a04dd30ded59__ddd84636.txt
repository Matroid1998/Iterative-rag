Description:
A protein that adsorbs at the oil-water droplet interface and introduces iron, catalyzing lipid oxidation.

LDL particles feature
13
a coreshell structure where a core of triglycerides cholesteryl
14
esters is surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and
15
apolipoproteins. During the emulsification of mayonnaise,
16
LDL particles can release phospholipids and apolipoproteins
17
that together with phosvitin adsorb at the oilwater droplet
18
interface. LDLs can also remain structurally intact and form
19
granules present in the continuous phase or adsorbed at the
20
oilwater interface depending on mechanical treatments and
21
conditions (Anton et al., 2003; Mizutani and Nakamura, 1985;
22
Sirvente et al., 2007). 23
Lipid oxidation in mayonnaise is mediated by free radical
24
chain reactions (Schaich, 2012) and catalysed by the presence
25
of metal ions such as iron introduced via phosvitin (Berton
26
Carabin et al., 2014).

Description:
Strongly binds prooxidant iron ions at neutral pH.

Text:
Reactions between alkyl radicals (L)
27
and molecular oxygen generate peroxyl radicals (LOO), which
28
further accelerate lipid peroxidation by reacting with unsat
29
urated lipids. Whereas at neutral pH prooxidant iron ions
30
are strongly bound to the negatively charged phosvitin, a
31
weaker binding at the acidic pH of mayonnaise makes them
32
available as catalysts for lipid oxidation (Merkx et al., 2019). 33
Therefore, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is often
34
added to mayonnaise to bind free metal ions via chelation
35
and thus reduces the formation of lipid peroxidation (LPO)
36
products (Lee and Decker, 2011; Nielsen et al., 2004).
