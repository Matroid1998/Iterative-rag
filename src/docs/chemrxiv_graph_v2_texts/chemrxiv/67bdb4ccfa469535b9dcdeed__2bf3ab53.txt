Description:
An ambidentate ligand known for its electronic and magnetic properties in solution.

Text:
Till now, various literature published on the 
ambidentate thiocyanate ligand ligated Fe(III) tetraphenylporphyrin have shown the electronic and 
magnetic properties in solution along with their theoretical justification.2023 However, a complete 
electrochemical study in solution as well as magnetic properties in the solid state have not been investigated 
so far. Proper justification of the highspin state of Fe(III) with uniaxial anisotropy in this particular 
coordination environment is also another area of interest that requires considerable knowledge of the crystal 
and electronic structure of these mononuclear porphyrins.
