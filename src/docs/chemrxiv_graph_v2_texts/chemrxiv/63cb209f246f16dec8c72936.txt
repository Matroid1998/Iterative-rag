Description:
An artificial biodegradable polymer used in blends for improved mechanical and physical properties in food packaging.

Text:
Meat is a food that is most prone to microbial contamination and degradation,
and efforts focused on developing new polymers with antimicrobial activity for food
meat packaging (Lavoine et al., 2015). Most of these new active polymers are prepared
by blending biodegradable polymers (such as chitosan, gelatin, or starch) with artificial
biodegradable polymers (such as polyvinylalcohol) in different proportions and doping
the blend with antimicrobial compounds (Lee et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2016). The
advantage of blending natural or artificial polymers is that the blend displays improved
mechanical and physical properties when compared to isolated polymers (Kanimozhi et
al., 2016). 2
