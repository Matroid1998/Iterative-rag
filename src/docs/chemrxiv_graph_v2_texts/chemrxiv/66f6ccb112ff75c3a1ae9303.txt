Description:
Detected in interstellar space and characterized by rotational spectral lines.

Text:
Both methyl isocyanide (CH3NC) and acetonitrile (CH3CN) are detected in the interstellar space, 
and characterized by their rotational spectral lines due to their relatively small molecular size. These 
molecules thus usually served as valuable interstellar probes, and provide extensive insights into the 
physical and chemical conditions of the interstellar medium and contribute to our understanding of 
star formation processes within these cosmic regions.14 Additionally, they are also detected in Earths 
atmosphere.5, 6 Relevant investigation is important for enhancing our comprehension of their 
atmospheric behavior, and lays a scientific foundation for air pollution control and risk assessment.
