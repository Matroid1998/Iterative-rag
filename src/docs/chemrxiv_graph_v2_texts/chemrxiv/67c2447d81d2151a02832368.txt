Description:
A polymer that interacts with nucleic acid cargo through electrostatic and potentially other binding modes.

Their studies suggest that the ability of these deliv
ery systems to robustly accommodate and deliver these dif
ferent types of cargoes is facilitated by their ability to bind
them through multiple mechanisms, including electrostatic,
stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions14,25,26. This
insight opens new avenues for investigating similar phenom
ena in PEIbased systems, whose interactions with nucleic
acid cargo have historically been assumed to be merely elec
trostatic in nature. Interestingly, a few computational studies
have predicted that branched PEI (BPEI) might engage in ad
ditional binding modes beyond electrostatics27,28. However,
there has not been any experimental evidence to confirm this. To address this gap, we investigated the binding modes
and macromolecular structure of PEIDNA polyplexes us
ing infrared (IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM).

Description:
Used in gene delivery systems, interacting with DNA through complexation and binding mechanisms.

Text:
IR spectroscopy probes vibrations that
report on bondspecific interactions and conformational
changes, while TEM provides insights into polyplex mor
phology. Together, these methods offer a comprehensive
molecularlevel perspective of PEIDNA dynamics. Using TEM, we first examine the morphologies of LPEI
and BPEI polyplexes, followed by UVVis absorbance spec
troscopy to analyze the complexation kinetics of these poly
mers to DNA. We then apply Fourier Transform IR (FTIR)
spectroscopy with Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR)
analysis to differentiate between the binding modes of LPEI
and BPEI polyplexes. Our comprehensive approach eluci
dates new insights into the molecularlevel binding mecha
nisms of PEI systems to DNA, which we anticipate will help
guide the development of more efficient and versatile PEI
based gene delivery systems.
