Description:
A perovskite material with a black phase that is prone to stability and reproducibility issues due to crystallization challenges.

Text:
A wide range of processing methodologies and additives have been explored to synthe
size the black perovskite phase with the primary goal to make a good quality defectfree
blackFAPbI3 and avoid the formation of the yellow phase. However, perovskite electronics
often suffer from the problem of stability and reproducibility. This is mainly due to the
lack of control over the crystallization process where several fundamental questions yet re
main unanswered, such as (a) why a direct conversion of yellow to black phase by heating
results in low efficiencies and less stable PSCs, (b) how and what kind of polytypes, stacking
faults and defects are formed during the crystallization of FAPbI3, (c) what is the atomic
structure of grain boundaries.
