Description:
A mineral that can be chemically treated to remove oxygen ions from crystallographic cages.

The first reports of anionic electrons were detailed for 
solutions of alkali metals, however attempts to crystallise these 
systems with the electron remaining offatom proved difficult.10 
The first successful solid system containing anionic electrons 
was an organic complex condensed from such a solution by Dye 
et al. in 1983, and given the name electride.11 However, the 
material was extremely unstable at room temperature. It was 
not until the first purely inorganic electride was synthesised 
around 20 years later, that it was demonstrated that electrides 
could be stable with respect to temperature and pressure.12 The 
inorganic electride was synthesised by chemical treatment of 
the mineral mayenite (12723) to remove the oxygen 
ions 
from 
crystallographic 
cages, 
creating
