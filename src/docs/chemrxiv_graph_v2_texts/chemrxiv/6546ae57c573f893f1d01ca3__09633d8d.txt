Description:
A component of the Frustrated Lewis Trios (FLTs) system.

Text:
Herein, we detail its synthesis, electronic structure and 
demonstrate the heterolytic activation of chemical bonds along the FLT 
vector. Finally, we show how this system displays pendulumlike 
hemilability between the dualfunction phosphines, demonstrating the 
promise the FLT motif holds for the heterolytic activation of chemical 
bonds. a) FLP Reactivity
