Description:
Gemdimethyl groups can be replaced by cyclopropane or cyclobutane derivatives to enhance metabolic stability.

Text:
Strained cycloalkanes displaying an aminomethylsubstituent 
are common features in pharmaceutical candidates and approved 
drugs, as well as agrochemicals. These small polar scaffolds fre
quently convey important physical features that lead enhanced bio
logical properties, when compared with linear Nalkyl congeners. (Fig. 1A).1 In particular, cyclopropane and cyclobutane derivatives 
can boost metabolic stability and reduce lipophilicity when used as 
bioisosteres of gemdimethyl, isopropyl or phenyl groups, which re
sults from a combination of high coplanarity of the ringcarbon at
oms, relatively shorter CC bonds, enhanced character and 
shorter and stronger CH bonds.
