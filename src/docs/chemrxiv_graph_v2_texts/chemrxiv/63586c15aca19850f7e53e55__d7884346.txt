Drug design routinely involves modification of chemical structure to improve molecular 
properties. Over decades, large structureproperty datasets have been generated at great expense, 
but translating such data into solutions for drug design problems is a challenge. To translate large 
volumes of raw structureproperty data into humanreadable insights, computational platforms 
for matched molecular pair analysis have been developed.13 Matched molecular pair (MMP) is 
defined as two structures related by a defined transform in structure,1 such as ethane (CH3CH3) 
and ethanol (CH3CH2OH) being related by transform of H to OH. MMPs and their transforms 
can be found automatically via unsupervised MMP identification algorithms,410 which can 
identify useful transforms that a human might not have thought of, but which will also find many 
irrelevant transforms to a given problem.
