ing functional groups onto the carbon fiber surface. The result
ing plasmatreated carbon cloth (pCC) exhibits significantly 
enhanced affinity with methanol (MeOH) solvent and chemi
cals. Subsequently, pCC is immersed in a Zn(NO3)2MeOH 
solution and then transferred into a 2MeImMeOH solution, 
allowing ZIF8 particles to grow onto the carbon fiber tightly 
and uniformaly, thereby forming pZIFCC. The obtained p
ZIFCC undergoes sintering in a nitrogen atmosphere, resulting 
in the formation of pZNCC. Figure 1. The schematic diagram of the synthetic process of p
ZNCC. Figure 2 illustrates the role of plasma in the synthesis of uniform 
and tight adhered ZIF8 layer on the carbon fiber.

Description:
Forms the fiber that is infiltrated by Zn(NO3)2 and 2MeIm for ZIF8 particle growth.

Text:
In Figure 2a, 
without plasma activation, the Zn(NO3)2 and 2MeIm fails to 
fully infiltrate the carbon fiber, resulting in incomplete cover
age and agglomeration of ZIF8 particles (Figure 2b). However, 
upon activation by oxygen plasma, surface contaminants are re
moved, and oxygen functional groups are uniformly distributed 
on the carbon fiber surface, enhancing zincophilicity.28 As a re
sult, Zn(NO3)2 and 2MeIm can fully infiltrate the carbon fiber 
(Figure 2c), enabling tight and homogeneous growth of ZIF8 
particles on the carbon fiber surface (Figure 2d). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024t0h0z ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000268855246 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
