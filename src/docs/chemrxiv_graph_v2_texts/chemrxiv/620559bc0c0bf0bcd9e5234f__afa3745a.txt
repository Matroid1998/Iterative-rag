Description:
A proposed electrolyte solution for magnesium-ion batteries.

These benefits are reflected in the exponentially increasing number 
of publications that have recently been dedicated to the topic of MIBs, as shown in Figure 1 
from the publication by Li et al.11 On the other hand, a great deal of effort is required to find 
suitable electrolytes that allow reversible magnesium deposition while at the same time 
providing a broad electrochemical window.9,12 Conventional carbonate electrolytes cannot be 
used for rechargeable MIBs because the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed by 
decomposition products of the electrolyte is not permeable to magnesium, in contrast to 
lithiumcations.10,13 Proposed solutions are electrolytes based on Grignard reagents, 
Mg(TFSI)2 salts or ionic liquids, as well as the use of polymeric interlayers as artificial SEI.13,14 
Nevertheless, the structure and growth mechanism of SEI formation remains poorly 
understood due to its high complexity, highlighting the need for adequate theoretical modeling 
on different time and length scales.15 
The second controversial issue is whether dendrite formation is possible on metallic 
magnesium anodes.
