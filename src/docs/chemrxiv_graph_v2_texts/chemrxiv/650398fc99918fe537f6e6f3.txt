Description:
A molecule with superior acceptor ability that induces metal-to-ligand backdonation, which can weaken the CO bond.

Text:
Often, MCO interactions are further supported 
by the superior acceptor ability of CO that induces metaltoligand  backdonation.10 However, 
the electron flow through the frame (or to  orbitals of CO) simultaneously weakens the CO 
bond.10 
To date, a majority of transition metal CO studies are focused on the first and secondrow 
TMs, with less attention on the heavier thirdrow TMs.
