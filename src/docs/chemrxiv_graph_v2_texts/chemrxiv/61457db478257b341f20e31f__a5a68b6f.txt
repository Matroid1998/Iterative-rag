Description:
Subject to high temperature decomposition dynamics.

However, depending on the exposed crystallographic
33
surface, Al atoms on the surface can display penta, tetra, and tricoordination and exhibit
34
Lewis acidity.2326 Because of its high degree of surface heterogeneity, Al2O3 oers a high
35
catalytic activity and is a promising candidate for the decomposition of various CWAs.27

In this work, we present the rst ab initio molecular dynamics study for probing high

temperature decomposition dynamics of diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) on the
