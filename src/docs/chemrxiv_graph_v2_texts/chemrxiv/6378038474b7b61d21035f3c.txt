Description:
Atoms that can be replaced by a bromine atom, affecting molecular symmetry.

Text:
According to the 
calculations, the observed splitting in the cation spectrum was 
ascribed primarily to the spin coupling of the unpaired electron in 
the partially vacant  orbital with the unpaired electrons resulting 
from the excitation of one of the carbon 1s electrons to the vacant 
 orbitals.9,10 JahnTeller relaxation causing symmetry distortion 
was also considered. Replacing one of the hydrogen atoms of Bz by a bromine atom 
lowers the D6h pointgroup symmetry of neutral Bz to C2v, and also 
lifts the neardegeneracies between the six core orbitals of the 
carbon atoms.
