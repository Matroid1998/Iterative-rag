Description:
Reported with reduced formation energies affecting electronic transport and DW structure.

Text:
For example, point defects at DWs in
PbZrxTi1xO3
1214, hRMnO3
1520 and LiNbO3
2126, are typically
reported with reduced formation energies and often alter elec
tronic transport, DW mobility and DW structure. Ferroelectric LiNbO3 has been studied extensively for its
DWs2732 and more recently also because of hyperferroelectric
ity33,34. The ground state structure is perovskite with space
group R3c35, and the measured spontaneous polarisation is 70
Ccm2 36,37, and the TC 1200C38.
