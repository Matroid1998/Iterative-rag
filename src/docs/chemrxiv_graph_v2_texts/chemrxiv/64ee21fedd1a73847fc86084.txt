Description:
A nonselective, broad-spectrum herbicide with 8.6 billion kilograms applied globally since 1974.

Text:
Advancements in biotechnology during the 20th century led to the development of 
nontransgenic crops that showed selective resistance to herbicides as well as transgenic 
crops that were genetically engineered to be insusceptible to specific nonselective 
herbicides. The nontransgenic herbicide approach has proven to be effective,13 however 
demonstrates inferior crop market share and weed regulation compared to more 
economical transgenicbased herbicides.4 An example of this is glyphosate (GLY), the 
nonselective, broadspectrum herbicide with 8.6 billion kilograms being applied globally 
since 1974.
