Description:
Reacts via Michael addition with activated olefins.

Text:
An activated olen reacts with a cysteine via Michael addition (Scheme 1),
which has been extensively studied since the 1960s.1014 Although alternative mecha
nisms have been proposed,15 the ratelimiting step of the reaction is believed to be the
nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated thiolate (either directly or via a base catalyst) on
the electrondecient  carbon, leading to a carbanion intermediate, which protonates to
form the thioether adduct (Scheme 1). Thus, the intrinsic reaction rate of a thiolMichael
addition (for protein targets) is determined by the reactivity of the cysteine thiol and that of
the Michael acceptor.

Description:
Reactivities can be assessed in drug targets using pKa prediction tools.

Text:
As the thiol reactivity is related to the availability of the nucleophilic
thiolate,16,17 accurate pK a prediction tools such as the GPUaccelerated continuous con
stant pH molecular dynamics simulations18 can be used to assess cysteine reactivities
in drug targets.19,20 In principle, the intrinsic reactivity of a Michael acceptor can be pre
