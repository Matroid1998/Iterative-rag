of fluorine into organic 
molecules often strongly affects their properties, including their polarity, solubility, and 
lipophilicity. Among many organic fluorinecontaining compounds, fluorinated arenes 
are used as semiconductors, lightemitting materials, and liquid crystals6. Owing to its 
negative inductive effect, the incorporation of fluorine into materials leads to a 
decrease in orbital energy. As such, it is important to develop synthetic methods that 
provide access to aromatic molecules containing many CF bonds79, and the extreme 
targets of the research field are aromatic molecules wherein all hydrogen atoms are 
replaced with fluorine atoms, i.e., perfluoroarenes1014. However, methods to 
synthesize strained perfluoroarenes remain very limited. It is known that various 
fluorinated fullerenes (Fig.

the unsaturated bonds of fullerenes, but these are virtually the only examples of highly 
strained perfluoroarenes15. Although Suzuki and coworkers have shown that 
perfluororubrene (Fig. 1a, top right) possesses a twisted structure with a slight strain16, 
a method to apply more strain to perfluoroarenes has not yet been reported. Here, we report the synthesis of perfluorocycloparaphenylenes (PFCPPs), a class 
of highly strained ringshaped perfluoroarenes (Fig. 1a, bottom) in which all hydrogen 
atoms of the corresponding cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs)1719 are replaced with 
fluorine atoms. This replacement of hydrogen with fluorine can be expected to result 
in a significant change of the structural and electronic properties of the PFCPPs20.
