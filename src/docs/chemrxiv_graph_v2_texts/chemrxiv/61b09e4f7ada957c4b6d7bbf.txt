Description:
Compounds that can undergo Mn-mediated carbonyl radical addition.

Text:
Despite the current limitations associ
ated with the Mnmediated carbonyl aradical addition to 
olefins (vide infra), we identified this transformation as a 
full atomeconomy alternative to existing enolates and 
metalbased systems. Therefore, we decided to systemati
cally investigate the parameters that govern this reaction to 
assemble a general and robust set of conditions that would 
supplant existing procedures. Figure 1. Introduction to aalkylation of carbonyls.
