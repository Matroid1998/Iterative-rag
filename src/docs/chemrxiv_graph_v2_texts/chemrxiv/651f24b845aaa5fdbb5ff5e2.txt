Description:
A gas captured from flue gas and air, used in direct air capture technologies.

Text:
They efficiently capture CO2 
from flue gas at ambient pressure813 and are also promising for direct capture of CO2 from air 
(a.k.a. direct air capture or DAC)14, 15. However, as with all DAC technologies, DESs face 
significant challenges due to the relatively low (from a separations standpoint) concentration 
of CO2 in air, especially when compared with the other components in air. In particular, the 
significantly higher concentrations of water and oxygen in air impact the performance of DAC 
technologies16, 17.
