Description:
A drug encapsulated in the hydrophobic core of polymer micelles.

Text:
paclitaxel.3 Such formulations are usually prepared via hydration of 
61 
a thin film containing the polymers and drugs, after removal of the ethanol solution.4,5 As for any other 
62 
polymer micelle based formulation, the more hydrophobic B blocks are believed to function as the 
63 
main drug reservoir, i.e. the part of the micelle where the drugs are encapsulated, whereas the more 
64 
hydrophilic A blocks serve as a protective, solubilizing corona of the micelle (Figure 1).
