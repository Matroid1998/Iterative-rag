Description:
An oxide-based Li-ion conductor with electrochemical stability and high Li-ion conductivity.

Text:
Oxidebased Liion conductors, such 
as Li7La3Zr2O12 and variants (LLZO; see structural details in Figure 1a)1,2,3 belong to the most 
promising candidates, due to their unique feature of combining electrochemical stability with 
relatively high Liion conductivities (up to 1.3 mScm) with the potential to solidstate batteries 
with theoretical densities of up to 400 Whkg and 1000 WhL.4,5,6 Further advantages of 
LLZO are its processibility in air, and improved safety even at high operating temperatures 
compared to other solid electrolytes.
