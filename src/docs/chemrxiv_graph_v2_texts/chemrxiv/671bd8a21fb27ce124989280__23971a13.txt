With a band gap of approximately 2.6 eV, WO3 efficiently 
absorbs visible light, making it suitable for solar energy applications. Its high chemical stability 
ensures longterm operation, while its excellent electron mobility promotes efficient charge 
transport. Additionally, the strong oxidizing power of WO3, attributed to its optimal valence band 
position, significantly enhances its performance in PEC processes 6,7. Moreover, WO3 can be 
combined with various semiconductors to further enhance its PEC performance. Commonly used 
semiconductors include iron oxide (Fe2O3) 8, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) 9, copper oxide 
(Cu2O) 10, and bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) 11,12. Among these semiconductors, BiVO4 stands out as
