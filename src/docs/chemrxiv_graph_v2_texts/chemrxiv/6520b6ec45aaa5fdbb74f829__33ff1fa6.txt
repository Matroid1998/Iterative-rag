Description:
A compound within the aminocyclopentitol class known for its complex molecular structure.

Text:
Densely functionalized natural products continue to capture 
the attention of synthetic chemists for their distinctive and 
complex molecular architectures. The aminocyclopentitol class 
of natural products, including pactamycin 1, jogyamycin 2 and 
related compounds (Figure 1), are a unique subgroup of 
natural products that display a dense network of functional 
groups and a high degree of molecular complexity.

Description:
Isolated from a strain of Streptomyces in 2012.

This 
complexity prompted one paper to express the opinion these 
natural products were likely inaccessible to synthesis,1 but 
their formidable structures and potent antimalarial activities 
have made them popular synthetic targets.2 Pactamycin 1, the 
most wellknown member of this class, was isolated from 
Streptomyces pactum in 1961,3 but its structure was not 
assigned until 1972.4 Cranomycin 3 was isolated in 1964 from 
a culture broth of Streptomyces SE801 and later found to be 
present in two other species of Streptomyces.5ad 
 Jogyamycin 2 is a more recent addition to this family, 
having been isolated from a strain of Streptomyces in 2012 by 
Otogura, Omura and coworkers.6 In addition to the natural 
aminocyclitols 13, the Mahmud group has leveraged their 
discovery of the gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis 
of pactamycin 1 to produce the genetically engineered analogs 
TM025 4 and TM026 5.7ac 
Compounds 15 exhibit nM levels of potency against drug 
resistant malaria;6,7,8 however, the activities of 13 are non 
selective.
