Description:
Involved in alkyl transfer processes central to coordinative chain transfer olefin polymerization catalysis.

Text:
Studying the alkyl transfer 
processes in the Cp2ZrCl2Et2Zn system is an important task, since 
they are central to coordinative chain transfer olefin polymerization 
catalysis. This work presents the first results of studying the 
exchange reaction between zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) and 
Et2Zn.
