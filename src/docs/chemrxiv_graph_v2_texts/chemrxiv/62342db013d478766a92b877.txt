Description:
Involved in the hydrogen abstraction-acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism for PAH growth.

Text:
As for PAH growth, the hydrogen abstractionacetylene addition (HACA) 
mechanism was proposed by Frenklach et al (14, 15). The phenyl additioncyclization (PAC) is 
another mechanism that provides an efficient way for ring growth (16). The recently proposed 
clustering of hydrocarbons by radicalchain reaction (CHRCR) mechanism also provides a 
possible route for the PAH growth (7). Additionally, when the density of fuel is high, the 
polymerization reactions may also be an alternative mechanism (17, 18). Compared with the 
PAH growth, the formation of soot inception is much more complicated. The number of reaction 
pathways involved in forming larger molecules grows exponentially with their sizes.
