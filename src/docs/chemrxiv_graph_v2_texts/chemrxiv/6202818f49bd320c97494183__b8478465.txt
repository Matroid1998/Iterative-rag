Description:
Hypervalent iodine compounds used as electrophilic group transfer reagents and mild oxidants.

Text:
Hypervalent iodine compounds (iodanes) have found widespread applications as 
electrophilic group transfer reagents,1 as mild oxidants for the synthesis of natural 
products2 and in organo and photocatalysis.3 Diaryliodonium salts are an important 
subclass among iodanes, which are commonly applied as electrophilic arylation 
reagents for transitionmetalcatalyzed and metalfree arylations.4 In this regard, 
cyclic diaryliodonium salts which are characterized by two aryl moieties directly 
connected or bridged with carbon or heteroatoms have been utilized for the effective 
synthesis of mono and doublefunctionalized diarylbased molecules through 
regioselective ring opening with a wide range of nucleophiles.5 They can also be 
applied as starting materials for the synthesis of annulated hetero and carbocycles.
