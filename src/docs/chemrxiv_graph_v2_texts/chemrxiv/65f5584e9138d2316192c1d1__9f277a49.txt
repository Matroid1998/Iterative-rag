Description:
Organic semiconductor molecules with annulated p-conjugated planes enabling various multidirectional intermolecular interactions.

However, 
these types of materials form a columnar crystal structure, whose 
semiconductor characteristics suffered from a lattice defect.28,29 
In this respect, organic semiconductor molecules possessing 
annulated pconjugated planes enable various multidirectional 
intermolecular interactions. Figure 1. Chemical structures of SDNTTs, DPhBTBT, and 1ag with 
the DBT core.
