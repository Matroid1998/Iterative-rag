Description:
Used as a buffer layer to facilitate epitaxial growth of sp2BN.

Text:
We have previously employed an AlN buffer layer to facilitate epitaxial growth of 
sp2BN on ccut sapphire.13,21 AlN growth on rcut Al2O3 also showed aplane (1120) 
oriented growth suggesting growth orientations can be altered based on the substrate 
used.22 Other studies of AlN growth on ccut and acut Al2O3 showed that the growth
