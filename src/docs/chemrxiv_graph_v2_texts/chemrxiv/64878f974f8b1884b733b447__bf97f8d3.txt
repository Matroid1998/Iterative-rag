Description:
The predominant product formed from the oxidation of 4methyl1pentanol.

Text:
At the outset of this project, it was our intention to adapt Barans protocol for an intramolecular C 
 H etherification, and we chose 4methyl1pentanol as a convenient optimization substrate. When 4
methyl1pentanol was treated with CuBr2, Zn(OTf)2, and Selectfluor, none of the desired 2,2
dimethyltetrahydrofuran formed. A very polar spot was visualized by thinlayer chromatography, and the 
crude sample had the acrid odor of a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR analysis confirmed that 4methylvaleric acid 
was the predominant product, an interesting surprise. Mild protocols for the direct oxidation of alcohols to 
carboxylic acids are especially valuable3842; generally twopot reactions are employed, with aldehydes
