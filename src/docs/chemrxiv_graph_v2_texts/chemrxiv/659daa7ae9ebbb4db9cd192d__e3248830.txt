Description:
Building blocks used in the preparation of secondary alkylamines.

Accordingly, 
the 
development of new methods that lead to straightforward, robust 
and modular preparations of secondary alkylamines remain a 
constant 
challenge 
to 
the 
synthetic 
organic 
chemistry 
community.2,3 While catalytic methods are emerging for their 
synthesis, most notably, alkene hydroamination, photoredox
mediated reactions, hydrogenation, biocatalytic transformations, 
CH activation, and others, the majority of secondary alkylamines 
are still prepared by carbonyl reductive amination (CRA) or N
alkylation.413 A possible reason for this preference is that 
methods such as CRA offer an operationally straightforward, 
robust and widely explored means by which to prepare secondary 
alkylamines via the union of two classes of extensive and diverse 
building blocks, namely primary amines and aldehydes or ketones.
