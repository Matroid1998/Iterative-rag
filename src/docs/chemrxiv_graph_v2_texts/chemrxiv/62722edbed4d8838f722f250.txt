Description:
A compound that poses health risks due to acidosis and can cause performance loss.

In 
11 
industrial and work environments, high concentrations of CO2 (in)directly pose health risks due 
12 
to acidosis or the enrichment of undesired species like viruses, or may cause performance loss 
13 
even during office work.3 Capable smart mobile devices and flexible wearables to collect 
14 
exhaled breath may support decentralized healthcare as well as professional and amateur sport.4 
15 
Handheld or stationary infraredabsorption sensors represent the stateoftheart device 
16 
technology but exhibit limitations regarding versatility, compactness and integrability.5 
17 
Integrated microsensors, with a superior property portfolio including small size, flexibility, and 
18 
low cost would facilitate comprehensive spatial and temporal analyses of CO2 in a wide range of 
19 
applications.6 
20 
Thus, the development of simple miniaturized sensors with rapid response for a wide range of 
21 
CO2 concentrations has attracted attention among materials scientists.7 Device concepts are 
22 
typically based on synthetically functionalized or hybridized (with metals or metal oxides) 
23 
carbon nanomaterials (CNM) to provide specific active sites on their surface or to tune their 
24 
electronic properties, respectively.8,9 However, relatively high costs, associated with the 
25 
sophisticated materials and fabrication processes, are still a challenge for commercialization.10 
26 
A promising inexpensive alternative are tailored nitrogendoped carbons (NCs).
