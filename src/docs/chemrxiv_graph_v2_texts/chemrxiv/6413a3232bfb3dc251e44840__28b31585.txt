Description:
Compounds that efficiently couple with O, N, or S nucleophiles under mild conditions in dual catalytic reaction systems.

Text:
While lightdriven, dual catalytic reaction systems 
involving a photocatalyst (PC) and a Ni catalyst have emerged 
as highly promising methods to form C(sp2)heteroatom bonds 
under mild conditions with readily available coupling 
partners,14 the vast majority of these methods only demonstrate 
coupling of a single type of nucleophile.5 In contrast, one of our 
groups has recently reported a method in which coupling of aryl 
halides to O, N, or S nucleophiles occurs efficiently without 
changing the reaction conditions (Fig.
