Description:
An anion that forms part of the close-packed system in spinel structures.

Text:
The spinel
structure (shown in Figure 1) consists of a closepacked system of
anions (X  O, S, Se) with onehalf of octahedral and oneeighth
of tetrahedral sites occupied by cations giving a reduced formula
of AB2X4 where A is a divalent cation and B trivalent. Spinels can be disordered over cationic sites by having some of
the B3 cations in tetrahedral rather that octahedral sites. The de
gree of inversion of a spinel describes the extent to which A2 and
