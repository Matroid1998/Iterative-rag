Description:
Cellular compounds that can add consecutively in redox reactions.

Cyclic dichalcogenide 
redox substrates can be used to avoid reduction by millimolar 
cellular monothiols (two consecutive monothiol additions) while 
selecting for micromolar vicinal dithiols (bimolecular reaction).6 
This arises since their onethioladducts have high effective 
molarity for intramolecular retroaddition kT1 that leads to 
expulsion of the initial attacking thiol before a second resolving 
thiol can add intermolecularly (Figure 1b, I).7 Yet, with a single 
equivalent of a vicinal dithiol, retroaddition kR1 can be out
competed by intramolecular resolution kR2 to complete the 
reduction and trigger a readout (c.f.
