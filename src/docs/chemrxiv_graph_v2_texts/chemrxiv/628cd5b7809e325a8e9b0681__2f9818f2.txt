Description:
A metal reducing agent that enables single electron transfer processes.

Text:
This is noteworthy 
given the difficulties associated with selective monoalkylation and the attractiveness of reductive deprotection. The current suite of 
methods includes basemediated elimination approaches10 and metal reducing agents that enable single electron transfer processes 
(SET) Examples of the latter include samarium diiodide (NOBn),11 lithium (DTBB  NH3),12 sodium,13 ruthenium (ZnCu)14 and 
titanium reagents (Figure 1C).15 A metalfree alternative has also been demonstrated using a super electron donor.16 Although metal
based SET methods constitute the vanguard of NO bond cleavage platforms, this dominance must be reconciled with limited func
tional group compatibility and operational challenges. Elemental sulfur provides a milder alternative to the aforementioned reduct
ants, but its use is confined to secondary amide derivatives and thus general solutions are required.17
