Description:
A heteroleptic compound with tunable HOMO and LUMO levels via ligand architecture, affecting photoredox activity.

Text:
Heteroleptic compounds incorporating (CN) and (NN) ligands, as in Ir(ppy)2(bpy) complexes,
benet from independent tunability of HOMO and LUMO levels via ligand architecture.920 Yet, the relationship between
structuralenvironmental perturbations and changes in the intricate excitedstate manifold of Ir(ppy)2(bpy) complexes are
hard to capture with existing spectroscopies, making it commensurately difcult to understand all the factors that modulate
their photoredox activity. Tuning of the redox potentials, absorption energy, excitedstate lifetime, and quantum yield, are
well known criteria, but other factors can play an important role.2124 For instance, recent work suggests that the size and
polarity of the counterion effects the efciency of the catalytic cycle,2531.
