Description:
Used in the production of ethylene through thermal cracking.

Text:
Ethylene (C2H4), an important chemical feedstock and 
industrial gas, has been widely used to produce polymers (e.g., 
plastics) and other valued products in modern life.14 
Currently, C2H4 is mainly produced by the thermal cracking of 
ethane (C2H6) or naphtha, with the inevitable presence of 
acetylene (C2H2) and C2H6 byproducts.
