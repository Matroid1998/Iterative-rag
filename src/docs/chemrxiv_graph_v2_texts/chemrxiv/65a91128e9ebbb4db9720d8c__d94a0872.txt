Description:
Neutral compound that can be removed from AlPO5 by treatment with methanolic hydrochloric acid.

Text:
Neutral triethylamine could be removed from AlPO5 by
treatment with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 147 C.3 Organic quaternary tetraethylammonium
was removed from the large pore zeolite Beta by a hydrothermal treatment with HNO3 but at the
cost of extracting also Al from the framework, which diminishes the crystallinity and reduces the
number of catalytic sites.4 Alkylammonium cations could also be removed from zeolites at low
temperature by a dry air,5 or oxygen radiofrequency plasma,6 possibly with the intervention of O3
and excited oxygen species, as it occurs in the detemplation by dielectric barrier discharge plasma.7 
Although the elimination of carbonaceous deposits (i.e.
