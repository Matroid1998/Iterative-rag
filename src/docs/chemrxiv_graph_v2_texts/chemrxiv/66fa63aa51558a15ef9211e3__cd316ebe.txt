Description:
Compounds that form carbon-centered radicals upon single electron reduction.

An alternative strategy which we proposed would involve design of a suitable substrate class for 
22 
MHAT catalysis whereby the inherent preference for orthocyclisation is supplanted by ipso
23 
substitution. This type of radical TruceSmiles rearrangement,20,21 has been extensively investigated 
24 
in recent years,22,23 though rarely in combination with transition metal catalysis.24 An early report 
25 
from the Stephenson group described a photoredoxcatalysed Smiles rearrangement via formation 
26 
of a carboncentered radical, formed upon single electron reduction of difluoroalkylbromides.25
