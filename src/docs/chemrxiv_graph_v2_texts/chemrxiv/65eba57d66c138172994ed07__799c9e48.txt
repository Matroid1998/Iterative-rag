Nitrogencontaining moieties, specifically aryl and heteroaryl amines (e.g. 1), are 
omnipresent in stateoftheart highthroughput screening (HTS) libraries and bioactive 
molecules1. The synthetic ease of forming the CN bond with ubiquitous aromatic coupling 
partners2 has greatly facilitated their prevalence. Recent advancements in medicinal chemistry 
have shifted focus towards compounds with high fraction of C(sp3)rich, as they exhibit improved 
physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties (Figure 1A). This has led to an exploration of 
methods to access threedimensional chemical spaces3, 4, including novel methods to make caged 
hydrocarbons, such as bicyclopentanes5 and cubanes6. Despite these advancements, efficient 
methods to access complex, C(sp3)rich amines (e.g.
