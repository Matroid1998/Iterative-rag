Description:
A reagent used to convert cineol into a hydrocarbon with a lemonlike odor.

Text:
In 1884, 
Wallach and Brass reported that boiling cineol with hydrogen 
chloride gave a hydrocarbon, C10H16, of lemonlike odour.2 
Continuing his researches on terpenes, for which he was 
eventually awarded the 1910 Nobel Prize in chemistry, Wallach 
identified both limonene isomers, dextrolimonene from Citrus 
fruits and laevolimonene from Pinus (pine needle oils), and their 
racemate, which he called dipentene having identified a rule 
for which terpenes had the general formula (C5H8)n. In his 
monumental book Terpenes und Campher (1914), the chapter 
about limonene reads 

Under the name limonene and dipentene In 1884 I 
distinguished components of essential oils by the following 
properties 

Limonene. The boiling point is between 175 and 177.
