Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are compounds of high public interest as 
40 
there is increasing evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse human and 
41 
environmental health effects1,2. These concerns are accompanied by their 
42 
documented accumulation in the environment (as socalled forever chemicals) due 
43 
to their widespread use and stability3. Wellknown PFAS include older PFAS such as 
44 
PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), as well as 
45 
newer PFAS such as GenX (a replacement product for the older PFAS). There is 
46 
strong regulatory debate about PFAS, including calls to regulate them as a class4 and 
47 
for better approaches to detect PFAS in humans and in the environment.
