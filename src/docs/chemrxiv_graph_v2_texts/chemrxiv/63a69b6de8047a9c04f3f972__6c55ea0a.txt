Description:
Exhibits metallic characteristics with highly anisotropic electronic properties.

A typical class of 2D monoelemental crystal is groupIVA materials, 
including graphene, silicene, germanene and stanene, most of which are important 
candidates for accessing topological insulator states.9,1719 Besides, subsequently 
found borophene exhibits metallic characteristics with highly anisotropic electronic 
properties, further enriching the 2D monoelement family.14 Another important group 
of 2D monoelemental crystals is GroupVA 2D materials, recently exhibiting 
remarkable development potential in the semiconductor device and arousing 
widespread interest.15,2024 For example, black phosphorene, the most investigated
