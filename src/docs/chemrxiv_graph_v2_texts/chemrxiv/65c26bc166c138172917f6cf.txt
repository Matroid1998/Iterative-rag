Description:
A halogen used in para-substitution to give 1,2-products with high enantioselectivity.

Text:
of methyl 
and tertbutyl groups in the paraposition gave the desired rearrangement products 3k and 3l in 58 
and 61 yield, respectively, and 919 er in both cases. With a paraNO2 electronwithdrawing group, 
the rearrangement was less efficient, leading to 47 of 1,2product 3m in 8416 er. Parahalogen 
substitution with fluorine, bromine and iodine gave the 1,2products 3n3p in good yield, with 
progressively greater preference for 1,2rearrangement, while enantioselectivity remained high 
(9010 er). Ortho and metasubstitution was also welltolerated, with 3q and 3r obtained in moderate 
yield but with high 1,2rearrangement selectivity. Finally, a range of nucleophiles can be used 
following the catalytic reaction to access different functional groups.
