Description:
A persistent radical known for its stability.

Text:
A number of
persistent radicals including nitronyl nitroxide, imino nitroxide, oxoverdazyl, dithiadiazolyl,
nitroxide, phenoxide etc., have been known over the years.1618 Recently, amino(carboxy)
radicals are proposed to be thermally stable at room temperature for weeks, by Mahoney
et al.19,20 Another exceptionally stable radical is the 1,2,4benzotriazinyl (Blatters) radical
synthesized by Blatter et al. in 1968,21 which has gained attention since the last few years
due to easy synthetic strategies proposed by Koutentis22,23 followed by Constantinides24,25
and Kaszyski et al.2628 There are several reports on the applications and magnetic prop
erties of Blatters radicals so far.2931 The stable thin films of Blatters radical are created
by Cicullo et al.

Description:
A radical used in the synthesis of stable diradicals by coupling with the Blatter radical.

further opening the doors to be utilized in devices.32 Its stability has been
validated by interfacing with gold substrates by Low et al.33 Very recently, Gallego et al. achieved the simultaneous enhancement in the conductance and the Seebackcoefficient by
bridging the Blatters radical between gold electrodes.34
Tetraphenylhexaazaanthracene (TPHA) is the earliest compound containing Blatter rad
ical with the zwitterionic groundstate.35 Recently, Rajca et al. synthesized stable diradicals
by coupling the Blatter radical with the nitronyl nitroxide radical and diBlatter diradical
