Description:
Produced through light-induced water splitting, considered a promising strategy for renewable energy generation.

Text:
Lightinduced reactions are fundamental for the generation of solar fuels and for a large number 
of chemical transformations generically known as light to chemistry.14 A particular case of this, 
is the lightinduced water splitting (hWS) reaction for hydrogen production, which is 
considered one of the most promising strategies for the generation of renewable and green 
energy vectors in the short to medium term. Three key elements are needed to achieve such a 
transformation a light absorber, a water oxidation catalyst and a proton reduction catalyst.
