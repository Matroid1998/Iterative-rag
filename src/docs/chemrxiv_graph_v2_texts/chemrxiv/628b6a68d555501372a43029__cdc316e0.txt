Description:
A cohesive structure characterized by unique interatomic distance and angle.

1c obtained after geometry optimization onto the ground state with quantum 
mechanical calculations based on the density functional theory DFT 3 is described in the 
tetragonal system (cf. Table 1). However, such tetrahedron was found less cohesive, explained by 
the lack of 3D periodicity. Additional carbon at 0,0,0 (corner positions, Fig. 1d) let gain 3D 
periodicity with cornersharing tetrahedra in all directions. The resulting tetC4 was found as 
cohesive as diamond 4 and equally characterized with unique interatomic distance and angle as 
shown in Table 1. Our proposition of a very simple dense carbon allotrope, i.e.
