Description:
Forms atomic building blocks such as oxygen tetrahedra in crystal structures.

1215 These techniques involve global
optimization of free parameters describing the crystal structure, and utilize domain knowledge to reduce the
available degrees of freedom as much as possible. Methods including simulated annealing, genetic algorithms,
and particle swarm have all been used to deduce the atomic positions. 12, 1620 While these approaches
have been shown to be effective in solving a wide range of crystal structures across chemistries, many rely on
the specification of an expected structure or atomic building blocks such as oxygen tetrahedra or prototype
structures to reduce the free parameters as much as possible. 1620 In some cases, these heuristics can
