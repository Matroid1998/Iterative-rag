Description:
A gas whose electron cloud can be distorted by exposed metal ions in MOFs, leading to polarization and enhanced gas adsorption.

Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)1 are crystalline porous 
coordination polymers with attractive properties, with porosity 
being a key feature,2 reaching up to around 7800 mg1.3 This 
intrinsic characteristic makes MOFs highly suitable for gas 
storage and separation applications.4 The effectiveness of 
MOFs in these processes significantly depends on their 
structural properties. Various strategies have been devised to 
enhance the sorption properties for specific gases.5 For 
instance, Guo et al. demonstrated the use of MOFs with pores 
featuring exposed metal ions capable of distorting the electron 
cloud of methane, leading to polarization and enhanced gas 
adsorption.6 McDonald et al.
