Description:
Used in photooxidations to provide 1,2dioxetanes and allyl hydroperoxides.

Modern sustainability criteria in chemical synthesis have spurred the development of energy and 
resourceconservative methodologies. Photooxygenations, which rely exclusively on abundant 
oxygen and visible light irradiation, have gained tremendous attention as one of the most atom
economic and sustainable reactions. Among the wide diversity of photooxidations, 22
cycloadditions and the Schenck ene reaction use alkenes to provide 1,2dioxetanes and allyl 
hydroperoxides, respectively. Both these reactions are endowed with a perfect atom economy and 
yield versatile synthetic precursors and chemical biology tools (Figure 1).
