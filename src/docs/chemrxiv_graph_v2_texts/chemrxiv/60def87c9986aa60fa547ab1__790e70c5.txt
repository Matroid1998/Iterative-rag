Description:
Triplet H2 with a slow conversion process from pH2 in the gas phase.

Text:
At the first glance, this question seems to make 
no sense, as we always introduce pH2, i.e., two protons in the 
nuclear singlet spin state, into the chemical reaction. However, 
this obvious answer holds only in the gas phase, where 
conversion between pH2 and triplet H2 (orthohydrogen, oH2) is 
a very slow process. For the actual PHIP and SABRE processes 
the answer is not so obvious because pH2 binds to a PHIP 
substrate or SABRE catalyst in such a way that the two protons 
occupy nonequivalent positions. In this situation, their 
magnetic or chemical equivalence is broken and singlettriplet 
conversion in H2 becomes operative.
