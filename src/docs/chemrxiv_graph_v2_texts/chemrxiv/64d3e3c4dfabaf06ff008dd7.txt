Description:
Produced as a byproduct in KAHA ligation.

In surveying possible bioconjugation chemistries to employ 
for lipid synthesis, we became interested in seminal studies from 
the Bode group, that reported on two novel amide bondforming 
methodologies, KAHA and KAT ligations, based on the reaction 
between Osubstituted hydroxylamines (HA) and ketoacids 
(KAs) or potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs), respectively.13,14 
Both ligations are chemoselective and have been extensively 
utilized 
in 
peptide 
synthesis 
and 
other 
bioconjugation 
applications.1518 The reactions are highly efficient in aqueous 
conditions19 and do not require additional reagents or catalysts. The 
KAHA 
ligation 
forms 
amides 
by 
decarboxylative 
condensation of Nalkylhydroxylamines and ketocarboxylic 
acids, 
producing 
only 
water 
and 
carbon 
dioxide 
as 
byproducts.20,21 Alternatively, KAT ligations take advantage of 
the reaction between hydroxylamines and acyltrifluoroborates to 
rapidly form amides in high yield.
