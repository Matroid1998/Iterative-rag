Description:
A metabolite of L tryptophan that can cause damage to pulmonary alveolar cells.

Text:
Within the fed cattle industry, respiratory disease is 
still the number one health concern1. Acute interstitial 
pneumonia (AIP, also known as pulmonary edema and 
emphysema, atypical interstitial pneumonia) is one of 
the more costly respiratory diseases2. The economic 
costs of the disease are quite high in cattle because the 
majority of cases develop close to harvest and are 
usually fatal. A common factor in the pathogenesis of 
this disease in ruminants has been established. It is 
precipitated by the ruminal degradation of L
tryptophan, a common amino acid in lush forages and 
feed grains, to 3methyl indole (3MI)3,4. It is 
absorbed, and in high enough concentrations its 
metabolites cause damage to pulmonary alveolar cells 
and AIP can develop.

Description:
A compound targeted as the causative agent of feedlot AIP in cattle.

Text:
In feedlot cattle being fed a high 
grain diet 3methyl indole has been targeted as the 
causative agent of feedlot AIP, but past research has 
demonstrated inconsistent results5,6. The amount of l
tryptophan in high grain diets may not be high enough 
to create enough 3MI to be toxic, leading the field to 
consider the cause of feedlot AIP to be multifactorial7. The formation of 3MI toxic metabolites in 
pulmonary cells that leads to AIP is due to intracellular 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes metabolizing 3
MI to 3methyleneindoline (3MEIN). Pulmonary 
pneumocyte 
CYP450 
enzymes 
can 
catalyze 
metabolism of other substrates, one of which is ethyl 
carbamate8. The metabolism of ethyl carbamate in 
pulmonary cells by CYP450 enzymes produces its 
toxic metabolites9. Its pathogenesis is very similar to 
3MI toxicity8.
