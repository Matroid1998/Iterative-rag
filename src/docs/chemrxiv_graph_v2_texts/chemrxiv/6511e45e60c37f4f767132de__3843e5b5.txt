Description:
Incompatible with cleavage of Ntosyl.

Text:
For instance, cleavage of Ntosyl is 
incompatible with use of an aryl bromide,2223 preliminary 
experiments indicated difficulties in controlling the reactivity for N
nosyl,24 and rearrangement is a known issue for carbamatebased 
protecting groups.2526 For these reasons, a more efficient approach 
was developed based on direct addition into freeNH aziridines. The 
bbranched motif of 4 could thus be traced back to addition of 
histidine into chiral aziridine 9 to forge the NC39 bond of 2. To 
mitigate the risk of imidazole eliminating from tyrosine to form the 
corresponding paraquinone methide (QM) (Figure 1, highlighted 
in red), bromide was chosen as a stable surrogate for hydroxyl group 
of the natural tyrosine with the intention to introduce the requisite 
phenol moiety at a late stage.
