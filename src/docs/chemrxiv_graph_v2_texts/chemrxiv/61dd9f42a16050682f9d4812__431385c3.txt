Description:
Serves as a cocatalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting when loaded on carbon nitride.

Text:
Most reported systems require a metal cocatalyst to archive overall water 
splitting.27,29,30 This is because metal cocatalysts facilitate charge separation,31 store charges, and serve 
as reaction sites that catalyze water oxidation and reduction.24,32,33 As such, much effort has been spent 
in the development of cocatalysts for photocatalysis.34,35 For example, carbon nitride loaded with 
PtCoOx as cocatalyst was reported to be active for photocatalytic overall water splitting.36 Similarly, a 
covalent triazinebased framework loaded with NiPxPt was reported to act as a single component pho
tocatalyst for overall water splitting.37 Here, we explored the homopolymer of dibenzob,dthiophene sul
fone (P10, Fig. 1a), which was shown previously to drive both proton reduction38 and water oxidation39 
as separate halfreactions in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors or acceptors.
