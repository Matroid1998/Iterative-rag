51218, Figure 1, abbreviated 5FU in the following) is 
a cytostatic drug that is used in the treatment of various types of cancer; it is typically 
administered intravenously. Due to its limited bioavailability and low absorption, high doses 
are required, often resulting in severe side effects. Moreover, high dosages can promote the 
development of chemoresistance to 5FU, reducing its therapeutic efficacy.19 In order to 
mitigate these drawbacks, the potential applicability of various materials as 5FU carriers has 
been investigated.20,21 The first investigation of 5FU storage and release using zeolites was 
published by Datt et al.
