Description:
Synthesized from oximes with phosgene or its substitutes.

Compared with traditional nucleophilic substitutions by using HCN or 
metal cyanides811 as well as recent popular oximationdehydration strategy12 with the prepared reagents13 or 
additional alkali1415 we designed an environmentally friendly alternative using triphosgene. This reagent is cheap 
and used without further preparation. In a recent report,16 the reaction site of oxime was used in the chemical detection of phosgene. Since then many 
researchers reported the synthesis of nitriles or amides from various oximes with phosgene or its substitutes 
(triphosgene and diphosgene). But most of these applications suffer from the effect of toxic phosgene overflow at 
alkaline conditions (such as adding TEA in the reaction system) and narrow substrate scope.
