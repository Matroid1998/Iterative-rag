Description:
A member of the MPX3 family known for its ability to chemically intercalate ions between layers.

Text:
This method has permitted to improve, for example, the electrocatalytic 
activity of these nanosheets with respect to the bulk.15 Unfortunately, the thickness and the lateral dimension of the resulting 
flakes are not of the finest quality.15,16 In order to improve the quality of the flakes, we can benefit from the wellknown capacity 
of MPX3 family to chemically intercalate ions in between their layers17 to expand them before the sonication step. This ability was 
first applied by Frindt et al.18 to exfoliate MnPS3 and CdPS3. However, full characterization of the resulting layers was not reported, 
and it was mandatory to use polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a capping agent to achieve the exfoliation of MnPS3.
