Description:
A metal used to reduce CO in chemical reactions.

Around the same time, Liebig16 circulating CO 
through molten potassium and made what was much later 
identified as a mixture of potassium ethynediolate and potas
sium benzenehexolate. Since then, a variety of s , p, d and f
block elements have been used to reduce CO, yielding different 
oxocarbon compounds (see e.g., ref 9 and references therein). Some oxocarbon compounds are stabilized by extensive con
jugation,1719 and anions tend to adopt cyclic structures with all 
carbon atoms bonded to a carbonyl or an enolic oxygen atom.
