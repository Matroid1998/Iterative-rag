Description:
A reagent used in alcohol oxidations, alkene functionalization, and heterocycle syntheses.

Text:
Hypervalent iodine compounds are versatile reagents for oxidative transformations in 
organic synthesis.15 Substrates like Phenyliodine(III)diacetate (PIDA), 2
iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) and DessMartinPeriodinan (1, DMP) can be used in alcohol 
oxidations68, alkene functionalization9, 10 or heterocycle syntheses11, 12. Most 
Ostabilized iodanes like IBX or DMP are characterized by a cyclic benziodoxolone 
structure, leading to higher thermal stability and more controlled reactivity.13, 14 
Such beneficial cyclic structures can also be accomplished with alcohol functionalities 
(2)15 or through pseudocyclic interactions with tethered Nheterocycles (3)16, 17 
or sulfonylgroups (4)18. (Figure 1, A).19 So far, only a limited amount of 
phosphorus oxoacid substituted iodanes were described. Examples include 
Hydroxy(phosphoryloxy)iodoarenes 5 and its cyclic derivative 6.
