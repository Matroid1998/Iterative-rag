Description:
Combines hardness and strength with comparatively high toughness due to its brick-and-mortar microstructure.

Strength and toughness are mutually exclusive properties of materials in general and ceramics in 
38 
particular. Designs found in biological structural materials such as nacre may provide useful 
39 
guidelines to alleviate this tradeoff (Ritchie, 2011). Nacrelike alumina, made of brittle constituents 
40 
only, combines the hardness and strength of standard alumina materials, and comparatively high 
41 
toughness. This toughness (damage resistance) is achieved mostly by the deviation of cracks along the 
42 
platelets interface in their brickandmortar microstructure (Bouville et al., 2014). While the deviation 
43 
of cracks in brickandmortar microstructures is well documented, several other toughening 
44 
mechanisms can exist in biological or bioinspired materials (Bouville, 2020; Kakisawa and 
45 
Sumitomo, 2011).

Description:
A material used in nacrelike composites to improve damage resistance through toughening mechanisms.

Text:
Discrete elements modeling (DEM) has been implemented to understand the 
46 
toughening mechanisms of nacrelike alumina and provide guidelines of microstructural features to 
47 
implement to improve the damage resistance of these composites (Radi et al., 2020). Establishing 
48 
quantitative links between nano to microscopic structures and bulk mechanical properties determined 
49 
in standardized fracture tests requires additional mechanical modeling at various scales and methods 
50 
that enable imaging the effects of microstructures on the mechanical behavior. For instance, structural 
51 
defects (such as local misalignments, variable platelet size) of real microstructures spanning few tens 
52 
of micrometers can be modeled by DEM, which suggests that they may have a significant effect on 
53 
crack propagation (Radi et al., 2021).
