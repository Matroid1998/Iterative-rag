Description:
A perovskite with high resistivity, often described as a poor electrocatalyst.

They 
exhibit an ABO3 structure where the Asite is typically occupied by rare earth elements and alkaline earth 
elements, and the Bsite is occupied with transition metals5. However, the electrical conductivity of 
perovskites varies by orders of magnitude, depending on the Bsite transition metal doping level andor 
the defect structure of the material68. In the literature, it is often addressed that a high electrical 
conductivity, ensuring an unhindered electron pathway through the material bulk, is a crucial necessity for 
a good electrocatalyst9. Therefore, perovskites with high resistivity are often described to be poor 
electrocatalysts such as LaFeO3, LaCoO3 or LaMnO3 10,11, and lowconductivity perovskites have been 
discarded from catalyst research in some cases, due to the difficulty to run sufficiently high current12.
