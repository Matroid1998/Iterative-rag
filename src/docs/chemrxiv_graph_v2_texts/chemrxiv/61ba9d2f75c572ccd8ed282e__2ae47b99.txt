Description:
A compound involved in nickel-catalyzed hydroalkenylation with aldehydes.

Text:
Transition metalcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions that avoid the need for pre
generation of air and moisturesensitive organometallic reagents provide an attractive route to 
highly functionalized synthetic intermediates.1 Notably, reductive couplings of unsaturated 
compounds with aldehydes have demonstrated high efficiency for the construction of carbon
carbon bonds in a number of contexts using alkynes,2 1,3dienes,3 or allenes (Scheme 1A).4 
Couplings of alkenes with aldehydes, however, are more difficult, and methods are often restricted 
to 
intramolecular 
versions,5 
highly 
activated 
alkenes 
such 
as 
norbornene6 
and 

methylenecyclopropane,7 or hydroacylations of styrenes.8 Advances using triethylsilyl triflate as 
promoter enabled considerable improvements in olefin scope to include alkenes with aromatic 
aldehydes and tertiary aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme 1B).9 More recently, cobalt and chromium 
cocatalyzed branchselective coupling of alkenes with aldehydes through an alkyl chromium 
intermediate further broadened the scope of substrate combinations tolerated.10 Additionally, iron
catalyzed transfer hydrogenative coupling of alkenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes11 and 
Brnsted acid enabled nickelcatalyzed hydroalkenylation of styrene derivatives with unactivated 
aldehydes provided further advances.12 Despite these developments, the majority of current 
methods for aldehydealkene reductive coupling are restricted to aromatic aldehydes,13 and the 
direct coupling reaction of abundantly available alkenes with unactivated aliphatic aldehydes still 
presents challenges in many cases.
