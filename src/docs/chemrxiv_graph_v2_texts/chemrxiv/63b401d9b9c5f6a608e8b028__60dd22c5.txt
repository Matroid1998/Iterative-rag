Description:
Used in chemical recycling methods for silicone, often requiring high catalytic amounts.

Text:
The recycling of silicone polymers and materials remains 
limited 
and 
principally 
involves 
downcycling 
through 
mechanical processing (powdered waste elastomers for 
instance) or limited chemical recycling.10,11 Most of the chemical 
recycling methods and associated industrial processes rely on a 
rather high catalytic amount (thus questioning the efficient 
catalysis) of alkaline hydroxides,11 or strong organic and 
inorganic acids12,13 and the reaction conditions as well as 
separation steps of the processes mandate high temperatures 
and low pressures, to recover valuable cyclic monomers.11 
There is thus a dire need of catalysis upgrading to allow for a 
wider implementation of silicone chemical recycling.

Description:
Strong catalysts for depolymerisation.

Text:
Recycling to 
recover PDMSbased cyclics, the shortest cycle within the 
silicone industry, remains highly desirable, and lacks very 
competitive catalyts to become viable on very large scales. In 1997, Allandrieu and Cardinaud have found that strong 
alkaline hydroxides or quaternary ammoniumbased hydroxide 
could be used as an efficient catalyst for the depolymerisation
