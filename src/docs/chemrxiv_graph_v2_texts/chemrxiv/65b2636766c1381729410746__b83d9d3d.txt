Among the energy storage technologies, lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been the leading 
45 
technology in terms of research and industrial application 1. LIBs offer high energy density due 
46 
to the high theoretical specific capacity of lithium (3860 mAh g1), low density (0.534 g cm3) 
47 
along with the lowest reduction potential (3.04 V vs SHE). In addition numerous high voltage 
48 
high capacity cathodes, including Nirich transition metal oxides (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, 
49 
LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, etc..), Lirich (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) and high spinel (LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4) 
50 
electrode materials were developed but still some of them raise safety issues and show 
51 
extreme capacity fading or have lower energy density 25.
