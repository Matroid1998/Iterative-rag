Description:
Involved in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs).

Text:
Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) is an emerging technology for renewable 
electricity generation 1,2. The current stateoftheart HEMFCs already have comparable 
performance to the more established proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, 
these HEMFCs require a very high platinumgroupmetal (PGM) loading to catalyze the hydrogen 
oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode 3,4, which is costprohibitive. The development of active 
HOR catalysts with low PGM loading is, thus, a critical step towards the implementation of 
HEMFCs. To improve the activity of PGMbased HOR catalysts, strategies including optimizing 
the binding energies of reaction intermediates (e.g., Hads or OHads) through modulation of 
electronic structures (i.e., d band centers) and bifunctional catalysis have been applied.
