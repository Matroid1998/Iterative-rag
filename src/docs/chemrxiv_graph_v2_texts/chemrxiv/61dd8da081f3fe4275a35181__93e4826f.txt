Description:
A polymorph of TiO2 with a surface energy of 0.4 J/mÂ² and may provide adequate surface adsorption and activation sites.

A few remarks on this system are appropriate. These are 
20 
(1) The core shell structure possibly alters the relative electronic structure of the system so as to be facile for photocatalytic reaction and 
for charge separation and transfer. (2) The thickness of the shell (Anatase) may be optimum so as to provide adequate amount of surface adsorption and activation sites.
