Description:
A compound obtained by reductive cleavage of an ester.

Text:
Emmons and Lucas made acetate 7 in 53 yield by 
combining the ketone with 90 peroxide in trifluoroacetic 
anhydride,6 and though sensitivity to ring opening is 
reported,7 Depuy reductively cleaved the ester to reach 
cyclopropanol also in 53 yield albeit with the 

Figure 2 Cyclopropanol route selection based upon 
availability of chemical feedstocks.
