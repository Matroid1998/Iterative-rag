Description:
A family of dyes used in SWIR imaging that are hydrophobic and prone to aggregation.

Text:
A growing suite of SWIR imaging agents have re
cently been developed,5 with notable examples coming 
from the cyanines,610 xanthenes,11, 12 and BODIPY fam
ilies.13 However, these examples are hydrophobic and 
intrinsically prone to aggregation. While nanoparticle 
formulations can potentially offset these drawbacks, it 
is preferable to develop complementary SWIR dyes 
that do not require encapsulation for in vivo imaging. In 
this study, we strategically remodeled the hemicyanine 
dye (HD)14, 15 (a common NIR platform) for multimodal 
SWIR FL and PA imaging.

Description:
Truncated molecules that are blue shifted by 100 nm due to loss of conjugation.

Text:
Of note, complementary re
modeling efforts have yielded PA and NIRII analogs.16, 
17 However, in the present study, we selected this plat
form owing to its relatively small size and ease of con
version into activitybased sensing probes.16, 1823 Un
fortunately, these favourable properties come at a cost 
because HDs are essentially truncated cyanines which 
are blue shifted by 100 nm. To compensate for the 
loss of conjugation, we introduced two key structural 
modifications using a modular synthetic route. Im
portantly, the best dye (SWIRHD) we prepared,
