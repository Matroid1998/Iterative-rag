For instance, 
alkylsubstitution in  or  position typically lead to narrow absorption and emission bands in 
the range of 500 to 550 nm, which are typically accompanied by high extinction coefficients 
and quantum yields up to 81.5c, 6 The high modularity of BODIPYs is showcased by 
expansion of the optical features from the visible to the NIR region or the enhancement of 
intersystem crossing to develop efficient triplet state photosensitizers.5c, 7 Applications of 
BODIPYs encompass numerous examples in various fields including bioimaging,8 sensing 
and detection,9 optoelectronics,10 photocatalysis11 and photodynamic therapy.8c, 8d, 12 The 
robustness and synthetic versatility of these dyes, in combination with their unique 
photophysical properties, motivated the development of more complex BODIPYcontaining 
structures.
