Synthesized by the Pudovik reaction involving nucleophilic addition of a dialkyl phosphite to an imine under basic conditions.

However, despite extensive studies in photocatalytic 
HATinduced C(sp3)H functionalization, the development of CP 
bond formation remains a formidable challenge at the current 
stage (Figure 1A). The hurdles include the oxidationsensitivity of 
commonly used P(III) and HP(V) reagents,5 poor compatibility 
between Preagents and electrophilic HAT reagents,5a,6 low 
reactivity between nucleophilic alkyl radicals and common P
reagents,5a,6a,7 and the requirement of excess CH substrates in 
most intermolecular HAT processes.2a,2b 
Aminophosphonic acids have attracted substantial 
interests in medicinal chemistry due to their intriguing biological 
activities8 (Figure 1B). The potential utility of aminophosphonic 
acids has stimulated significant research efforts aimed at 
developing efficient protocols for their synthesis. Conventionally, 
aminophosphonates were synthesized by the Pudovik 
reaction,9 which involves nucleophilic addition of a dialkyl 
phosphite to an imine under basic conditions.

Description:
Complex molecules assembled via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction.

Text:
Another powerful 
method for assembling complex aminophosphonates is the 
KabachnikFields reaction,10 a threecomponent phospha
Mannich reaction in which an imine is generated in situ from a 
carbonyl compound and an amine. Recent studies have 
demonstrated the phosphonylation of Naryl tertiary amines under 
photocatalytic and electrocatalytic conditions, initiated by single
electron oxidation of the tertiary amine.11,12 The oxidative 
phosphonylation of trialkyl amines was also realized by cobalt 
catalysis 
and 
photocatalysis.13 
The 
decarboxylative 
phosphonylation of amino acids enabled by photocatalysis has 
been reported as well.7b,14 However, these methods either require 
preformed imines, only work with a limited scope of simple 
tertiary amines, use excess amines, are difficult to be applied to 
latestage functionalization, or necessitate the presence of a 
carboxylic acid as a preexisting functionality.
