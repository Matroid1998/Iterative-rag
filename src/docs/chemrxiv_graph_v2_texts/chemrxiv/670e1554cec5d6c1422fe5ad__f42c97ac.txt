Description:
Molecular structures assembled through noncovalent interactions like metal coordination and hydrogen bonding.

Classic examples of rotaxanes, catenanes, and molecular 
knots.1 Because MIMs contain components that are not con
nected via rigid covalent bonds, the relative position of the 
components is typically highly dynamic, which has been 
used in applications across diverse fields, including molec
ular machinery, catalysis, and drug delivery systems.28 Typ
ically, the assembly of MIMs involves noncovalent interac
tions such as metal coordination,912 hydrogen bonding,1315 
 interactions,16 and electrostatic forces.17 Prominent ex
amples of these methods include pairing crown ethers with 
ammonium derivatives,1820 interactions between the elec
tronrich cavities of pillararenes and electrondeficient 
small molecules,2124 and the assembly of cyclobis(paraquat
pphenylene) with viologen radicals to form mechanical 
bonds.2527The very first rational synthesis of a 2catenane 
was achieved by a tour de force covalent template ap
proach.28 
Strained carbon nanohoops, featuring radially uninter
rupted conjugation such as ncycloparaphenylenes 
(nCPPs) and their derivatives, exhibit unique properties 
such as a sizedependent band gap.2933 Since their first syn
thesis in 2008, these molecules have garnered significant 
research interest, initially for their potential as seed mole
cules in the bottomup synthesis of carbon nanotubes34, 35 
and increasingly for applications in supramolecular chem
istry,36 catalysis37 and organic electronics.3840 The structure 
of prototypical CPPs is characterized by large rigid cavities 
and lacks sites for metal coordination or hydrogen bonding.
