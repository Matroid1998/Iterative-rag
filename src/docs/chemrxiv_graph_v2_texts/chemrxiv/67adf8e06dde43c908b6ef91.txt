Description:
Used in the room temperature synthesis of surfactant-free Au NPs.

Text:
Our recent investigation of the effect(s) of using different alcohols for the room 
temperature synthesis of the surfactantfree Au NPs showed that different formation 
pathways are followed for different alcohols used, namely methanol, ethanol, ethylene 
glycol, glycerol.29 The synthesis is faster in glycerol and lead to relatively small size 
NPs in the range 510 nm over a wide range of conditions (e.g. different concentrations 
of base andor alcohol contents). The synthesis using glycerol is also less sensitive to 
the light environment. The glycerolmediated synthesis is therefore overall more 
robust. However, a major drawback of the glycerolmediated synthesis is the use of a 
relatively viscous solvent.

Description:
A viscous solvent used as an alternative to glycerol.

Text:
The high viscosity of polyols prevent a simple and direct use 
of the Au NPs.30,31 Ethylene glycol is a suitable alternative to glycerol,32 but is still a 
viscous solvent.30 Ethanol presents the main benefit to have a very low viscosity A 
desirable feature to more easily process the NPs, e.g. to deposit the NPs on various 
surfaces to develop heterogeneous catalysts without the need for intensive and waste
generating steps typically requiring strong acids when polyols are used.30 Ethanol
mediated syntheses still lead to rather small ca. 10 nm Au NPs stable for years.16,23 
Nevertheless, the overall kinetics of NP formation are slower and the experimental 
window where the synthesis can be considered successful is narrower than in the case 
of polyolsmediated syntheses.29
