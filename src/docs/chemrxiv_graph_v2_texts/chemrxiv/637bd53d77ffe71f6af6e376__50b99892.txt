Description:
Generated from the reaction of aminoboranes with aldehydes, inaccessible through traditional routes.

As such, synthetic chem
ists have begun investigating aminoboranes as ambiphilic reagents 
to introduce these important groups on to organic molecules 
(Figure 2).11 Fernndez and coworkers exploited the Lewis acidity 
of the boron group to reductively aminate enones through activation 
with sodium tertbutoxide (Figure 2A).12 Bertrand and coworkers 
exploited the reactivity of aminoboranes with aldehydes to generate 
aldimines that cannot be accessed through traditional routes (Figure 
2B).13 Unfortunately, both methods and other similar methods14 re
quire loss of the boron group as stoichiometric waste.
