Description:
A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecule made of four fused benzene rings.

Text:
Pyrene is a single, welldefined molecule, made of four fused benzene rings. It is a polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon (PAH) molecule, which can be obtained by means of various processes, including the 
incomplete combustion of organic matter (such as wood and tobacco) and the photoionization of larger 
hydrocarbons, as it happens in the interstellar space (Gavilan et al., 2022). Pyrene photoionization is 
studied to understand its electronic structure and for the development of new materials (FigueiraDuarte 
 Mullen, 2011). Let us remember that pyrene is a pollutant, and it can be found in air, water, and soil 
(Bmmel et al., 2000), released into the environment because of industrial activities and burning of 
fossil fuels. Here we illustrate some Raman spectra of Pyrene.

Description:
The smallest peri-condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).

Text:
We will see that Gavilan et al., 2022, in 
the case of pyrene generated nanograins, obtained a spectrum which looks like that of biochar. We will 
also consider the results obtained by Smith et al., 2016, about their proposal of a structural analysis of 
char made by means of Raman spectroscopy. Pyrene 
As told by Gavilan et al., 2022, PAHs are a class of aromatic organic molecules that are ubiquitous on 
Earth, in the solar system, and in the interstellar medium. PAHs are playing important roles in the 
evolution of the cosmic environments (Gavilan et al., 2022). Pyrene (C16H10), is the smallest peri
condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Gavilan and coworkers used Raman spectroscopy 
to characterize pyrene in microcrystals and in pyrenederived nanograins.

Description:
A compound observed in microcrystalline form with narrow spectral bands.

Text:
The researchers observed a 
spectrum of microcrystalline pyrene which consisted of narrow bands, in agreement with measurements 
of single and powder pyrene crystals. The Table 2 of the work by Gavilan et al., gives the most relevant 
peaks at (cm1)
