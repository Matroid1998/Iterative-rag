Description:
An essential nucleophilic target in Mpro, crucial for its catalytic activity.

Text:
A notable therapeutic strategy 
for COVID19 is to design inhibitors with an electrophilic reactive group (warhead) that binds 
to the nucleophilic target cysteine 145 (Cys145) in Mpro. Cys145 is essential for the catalytic 
activity of Mpro, so blockage or modification of this residue is detrimental to the virus.1519 
Nirmatrelvir is a new FDAapproved medication developed for the treatment of COVID1920 that 
has a nitrile warhead and binds covalently and reversibly to Cys145 . There are several known 
derivatives of nirmatrelvir21, some of which are reversible, while others lead to irreversible 
catalytic reactions.
