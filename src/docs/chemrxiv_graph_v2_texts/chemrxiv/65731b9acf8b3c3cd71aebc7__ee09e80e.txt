Description:
Photocatalytic dyads used for proton reduction.

Since the functionality of inter
molecular systems is determined by various factors that are
difficult to control (e.g., collision probability), systematic
photophysical studies that elucidate the structureproperty
functionality relationships usually focus on intramolecular
systems. 2,3 These systematic studies provide comprehen
sive mechanistic insights and are important to understand
the role of individual molecular components in the overall
process. Figure 1. Schematic structures depicting the excitedstate distribu

tional electron transfer (c). Selected examples of bridge structures
typically incorporated in Ru(II)Pt(II) photocatalytic dyads for pro
ton reduction. These components include the PS, CAT, and the molecu
