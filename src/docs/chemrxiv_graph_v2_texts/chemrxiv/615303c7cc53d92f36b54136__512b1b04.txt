Description:
React with phosphines to form arylphosphonium salts and participate in multicomponent reactions with carbonyls or CO2.

Text:
presented a 
nucleophilic addition of phosphines to arynes leading to 
arylphosphonium salts (3).18 Biju and He demonstrated later in 
2014 and 2016 how this reactivity can be applied in 
multicomponent 
reactions 
with 
carbonyls 
or 
CO2.19,20 
Furthermore, Studer, Daugulis, and Miura developed aryne 
induced PIIIX bond insertions accessing orthostannylated, 
silylated or phosphinylated arylphosphines (6).2123 Analogously, 
Alajarin and Gogoi presented PVX bond insertions leading to 
orthoaminated, thiolated or hydroxylated arylphosphonium 
products (8).24,25 Between 2013 and 2021 Mhaske, Chen and 
Willoughby 
applied 
phosphites, 
Hphosphonates 
and 
silylphosphates (11) to generate arylphosphonates (12).2628 
Moreover, He presented a PObond insertion of arynes into 
organophosphinic acids (9).29 In summary, the broad spectrum 
of aryne reactivity can be exploited with phosphorous 
functionalities towards diversely arylated products enabling CP 
 bond formation.

Description:
Reactive intermediates used in O-arylation transformations.

Text:
However, no exclusive arynebased O
arylation has ever been described in the synthesis of 
organophosphorous compounds. More generally, there are 
limited examples of Oarylation transformations6 using arynes 
(scheme 1, B), overall restricted to few hydroxyl and carboxyl
group arylation protocols since 2004.3032 
Despite the many studies scrutinizing the reactivity of diverse 
arynophiles, the ability of phosphates to engage in reactions with 
arynes is absent from the literature. This is remarkable, as the 
urgent need to access probes for interrogation of phosphate 
functions, e.g. in analytical biochemistry, has driven innovative 
synthesis strategy development in the past years. 3337
