Description:
A compound synthesized with Noctyl substituents.

Text:
Using conditions developed by Huber,6h the literature 
synthesis of selenated bistriazole 3 bearing Noctyl substituents 
was replicated in an excellent 77 yield (Figure 1A); however, 
applying these conditions to a bistriazole bearing N
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl groups resulted in a complex mixture, 
with none of the expected product 4, or starting material 2, 
present. Only a small number of studies have previously focused 
on the lithiationfunctionalisation of triazoles (Figure 1B).7 This 
is surprising considering 1,4,5functionalised triazoles are 
bioactive motifs,1eh and postfunctionalisation of 1,4triazoles in 
the 5position provides a useful new vector to add or improve 
function in any of the myriad of applications for which triazoles 
find use.
