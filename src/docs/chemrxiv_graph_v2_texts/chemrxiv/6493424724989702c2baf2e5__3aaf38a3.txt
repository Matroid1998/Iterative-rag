Description:
A group of substances of high environmental and toxicological concern known for bioaccumulation and persistence.

Text:
Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of substances of high environmental and 
toxicological concern gaining increasing attention due to bioaccumulation and a growing reputation as 
forever chemicals  so much so that there is now a drive to treat PFAS as a class for environmental 
regulation1. The 2011 definition of PFAS by Buck et al.2 included substances as PFAS if they contained two 
(or more) connected saturated CF2 groups. In 2021, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) revised the definition of PFAS in ENVCBCMONO(2021)253 as follows PFAS are 
defined as fluorinated substances that contain at least one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon 
atom (without any HClBrI atom attached to it), i.e.

Description:
Chemicals that include at least a perfluorinated methyl or methylene group.

Text:
with a few noted exceptions, any chemical with at 
least a perfluorinated methyl group (CF3) or a perfluorinated methylene group (CF2) is a PFAS. While early research efforts focused mainly on a very limited list of PFAS, the number of documented 
PFAS are increasing. With the emergence of high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and the potential 
for socalled suspect screening for contaminants of interest using nontarget analytical techniques4,5, 
more extensive lists of PFAS became available. The first PFAS list hosted by the NORMAN Suspect List 
Exchange6,7 (hereafter NORMANSLE) was the 2015 list contributed by Trier et al.8, which became the basis 
for the OECD list of 4700 PFAS released in 20179,10. The NORMANSLE currently (June 2023) contains 
twelve PFAS lists6,7.

Description:
A group of fluorinated compounds frequently listed in chemical databases for suspect screening.

Text:
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) CompTox Chemistry 
Dashboard11 also hosts chemical lists12 and presently (June 2023) hosts 424 lists, including 51 lists 
matching the PFAS search term13,14, of which 41 contain exclusively fluorinated content. The National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently coordinated a list (hereafter the NIST PFAS Suspect 
List) of 4,948 entries, including expanded homologues and expert contributions15. Several other research 
efforts describe PFAS lists, with various degrees of availability. The OECD PFAS collection of 4700 PFAS9,10 
and the US EPA PFASMASTER list (10,000 PFAS in 2020, currently 12,034 entries in June 2023)16 are two 
of the most frequently used PFAS lists in suspect screening.
