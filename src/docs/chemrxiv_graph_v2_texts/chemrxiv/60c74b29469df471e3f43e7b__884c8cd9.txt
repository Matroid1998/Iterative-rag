Description:
A semiconductor material with a direct wide bandgap of 6.2 eV.

Text:
Aluminium nitride (AlN) is a widely used semiconductor material in several electronic devices1 
due to its direct wide bandgap of 6.2 eV2. The conventional method for depositing epitaxial 
films of AlN is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using trimethylaluminium (TMA), Al2(CH3)6 
and ammonia, NH3, at temperatures, typically, above 1000 C3. This limits the applications for 
AlN to substrates and underlying film materials that can withstand such temperatures. An 
alternative low temperature deposition route is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is a time
resolved form of CVD where the Al and N precursors are pulsed into the deposition chamber 
sequentially, separated by inert gas pulses. This gas pulsing makes the process solely depend 
on surface chemical reactions and omits gas phase chemical reactions, which typically need 
high temperatures.
