Description:
A persistent contaminant with strong carbon-fluorine bonds that resists degradation.

Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are hazardous, carcinogenic, and bioaccumu
30
lative contaminants found in groundwater, surface water, and a wide variety of consumer
31
products. The strong carbonfluorine (CF) bonds in these artificiallymade compounds
32
endow them with exceptional chemical stability and prevents most organisms from decom
33
posing these persistent contaminants,1 which further exacerbates their bioaccumulation and
34
toxicity. To mitigate and remove these persistent pollutants, many experimental efforts have
35
focused on chemical oxidation approaches to accelerate their degradation.2,3 In particular,
36
oxidative conditions have been applied to both perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; see Figure 1)
37
and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) contaminants.
