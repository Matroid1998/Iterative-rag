Description:
Molecules preferentially bind to the folded form of hydrophobic chains, leading to a higher population of folded forms in solution.

Text:
Contrarily, the hydrophobic 
association in waterTMAO solution or in waterureaTMAO is not well understood and several 
contradictory opinions are present in literature.11,2534 The work of Athawale et al.25 had found that 
TMAO does not affect the strength of the hydrophobic interactions. Simulations studies also found a 
greater number of TMAO molecules preferentially bind to the folded form of hydrophobic chain than 
that of the unfolded form and that leads to a higher population of folded form in TMAO solution.11,28 
Nair and van der Vegt31 showed by detailed thermodynamic analysis that TMAO stabilizes the 
collapsed hydrophobic polymer structures at low TMAO concentrations and the unfolded structures 
are stabilized at higher concentrations.
