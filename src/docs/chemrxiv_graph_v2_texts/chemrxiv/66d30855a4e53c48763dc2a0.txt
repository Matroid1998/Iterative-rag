Description:
Used in the form of activated carbon for effective adsorption of dyes from wastewater.

Effective management of dye waste is crucial to reduce these 
environmental impacts and promote sustainable practices within the textile industry. Currently, various methods are employed to clean dyecontaminated water before it is released into 
the environment. These methods include adsorption, biological degradation, photocatalysis, and 
advanced oxidation processes. Adsorption, using materials like activated carbon and bio adsorbents, 
is known for being effective in removing different dyes from wastewater 3,4. Biological methods, 
such as using microbes to break down complex dye molecules into less harmful substances, provide 
an ecofriendly alternative 5. Photocatalysis, which involve lightactivated catalysts, and advanced 
oxidation processes that create highly reactive species to degrade dyes, has also shown promise in 
both lab and pilotscale studies 68. Despite these advances, dye waste removal is not the ultimate fix.
