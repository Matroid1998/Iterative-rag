Description:
A perovskite material whose degradation is accelerated by exposure to ambient air, elevated temperatures, and electric fields.

Organicinorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have 
attracted substantial attention in recent years, demonstrating a 
rapid escalation in power conversion efficiency (PCE) since their 
inception.17 However, the longterm stability of perovskite 
materials such as CH3NH3PbI3 remains a significant concern, 
despite significance progress in recent years;8,9 their 
degradation is accelerated when exposed to ambient air, 
elevated temperatures, and electric fields.10,11 The vulnerability 
of halide perovskites to these environmental factors is partly 
attributed to the ionic character and resulting lability of the 
metalhalogen bonds; a semiconductor material featuring more 
covalent bonding may have higher stability. Furthermore, the 
presence of the toxic element Pb presents an additional 
obstacle for the commercial viability of these materials.
