Description:
An immunomodulatory drug used as a CRBN recruiter in PROTAC design.

ignited a transformative 
process in drug discovery towards the development of proximityinduced pharmacology as a 
new therapeutic modality.1,2 The potential and benefits of targeted protein degradation (TPD) 
as a cuttingedge paradigm are thoroughly demonstrated by molecular glues (MGs) and 
proteolysistargeting chimeras (PROTACs).3,4 Nowadays, the E3 ligase substrate receptor 
cereblon (CRBN), thalidomides primary target,1,5 is of particular importance in the fields of 
MGs and PROTACs.6,7 The immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) thalidomide (1, Figure 1), 
pomalidomide (2), lenalidomide (3), and avadomide (4) represent classical CRBN recruiters 
that are frequently exploited for PROTAC design.2,6,8 One feature, but also a potential caveat 
of this class of ligase binders is their potential to promote the degradation of lymphoid 
transcription factors such as IKZF1, IKZF3, and SALL4, the latter being responsible for severe 
teratogenicity caused by thalidomide analogs.913 Furthermore, the typical IMiD scaffolds are 
prone to hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation, rendering them less attractive for 
pharmacological intervention.1416 
These observations led to the development of a series of new CRBN binders that could 
potentially overcome the limitations above.
