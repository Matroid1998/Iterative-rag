Description:
Has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutrons.

Boron rich boron carbides such as the rhombohedral B13C2 exhibit high hardness1, 
high thermal stability, and high chemical resistance.2,3 Since 10B has a high absorption 
cross section for thermal neutrons, thin films of 10B isotope enriched boron rich boron 
carbides (BxC) have been investigated as neutron converter layer for neutron 
detectors.4,5,6,7,8,9 Given the 3He shortage10,11,12, 10B detectors are a viable replacement to 
3He detectors in large scale neutron facilities.6,9 A suggested evolution of a solidstate 
neutron detector will require filling of highaspect ratio vertical holes with neutron 
converter material.
