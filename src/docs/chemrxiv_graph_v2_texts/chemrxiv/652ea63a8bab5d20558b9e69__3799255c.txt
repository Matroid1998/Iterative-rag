Description:
A ligand that transfers to form the hydroxylated product in radical mechanisms.

The ubiquity of oxidized aliphatic frameworks in molecules of biological and pharmaceutical 
interest makes the conversion of C(sp3)H into C(sp3)O bonds a preferential transformation in 
modern synthetic organic chemistry.1,2 Among the numerous complexes able to perform catalytic C
H bond oxidations, homogeneous catalysts based on firstrow transition metals, that in the presence 
of hydrogen peroxide mimic the mode of action of oxygenases, represent an efficient way to 
perform these transformations.1a,2,3 CH bond oxidations executed by enzymes and bioinspired 
catalysts proceed through wellestablished radical mechanisms, where a highvalent metaloxo 
species engages in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a substrate CH bond to give a carbon 
radical that is then most commonly trapped by hydroxyl ligand transfer (OH rebound) to form the 
hydroxylated product (Scheme 1, path I).4,5,6
