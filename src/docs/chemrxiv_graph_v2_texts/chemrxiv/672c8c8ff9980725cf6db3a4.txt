Description:
A semiconductor material encountering quantum mechanical effects when layer thickness is scaled below 4 nm.

Text:
Maintaining the continued scaling of silicon technology has become increasingly challenging. This ongoing scaling process has led to soaring costs and highly intricate processing, encom
passing over a thousand steps for each wafer. Moreover, as the industry approaches extremely
small gate lengths (LG) below 12 nm, scaling encounters an inherent physical barrier, as the
channel thickness t needs to be notably decreased to ensure the device performance remains
optimal. A rough guideline is that t should be smaller than LG4 to ensure effective gate
control. However, in silicon and other threedimensional (3D) semiconductors, as the layer
thickness is scaled below 4 nm, quantum mechanical effects become increasingly prominent. 2
