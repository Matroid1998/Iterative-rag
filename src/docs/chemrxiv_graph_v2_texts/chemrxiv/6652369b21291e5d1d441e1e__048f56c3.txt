Description:
Can be epitaxially grown using chemical vapor deposition.

Text:
To enable the use of rBxC in such devices, there is a need to develop and 
understand thin film deposition processes for highquality, phase pure epitaxial rBxC films. We recently showed that rB4C can be epitaxially grown using chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) with triethylborane (TEB, B(CH2CH3)3) as a single source precursor and 4HSiC as 
substrates at 1300 C.21 The B4C films grew epitaxially on the (0001) surface of 4HSiC, 
commonly known as the Cface 4HSiC, with the inplane epitaxial relationship 
B4C(0001)1010 4HSiC(0001)1010.

Description:
Formed from an amorphous boron layer upon CVD with BCl3 and C3H8 at 1600 C.

Text:
In contrast, the film growing on the (0001) 4HSiC, 
also known as the Siface 4HSiC, was polycrystalline.21 From the literature, we note that 
epitaxial growth of rB4C on the Siface of 4HSiC substrates by CVD has been reported.22 But 
this CVD process used BCl3 and C3H8 as precursors and 4 offaxis 4HSiC substrates and 
required pretreatment of the surface with BCl3 to form an amorphous boron layer, which was 
converted to rB4C upon CVD with BCl3 and C3H8 at 1600 C. Without the pretreatment, the 
BxC growth on the Siface of 4HSiC was also polycrystalline.22 Epitaxial B4C growth on 4H
SiC (0001) has also been reported using pulsed lazer deposition.23
