Description:
Used as a ligand in the construction of transition metal complexes.

Text:
Cyclic thioethers are popular ligands for the construction of discrete transition metal complexes, 
coordination polymers, and threedimensional networks12. The presence and positioning of 
multiple sulfur atoms in the rings allow for a variety of multidentate binding modes to transition 
metals. Recent examples of cyclic thioethers used in this manner include 1,3,5trithiane34, 1,4
dithiane56, 1,3dithiane7, 1,4,7trithiacyclononane8, 1,4,8,11tetrathiacyclododecane8, and 
various macrocyclic thioetheresters9 and azathioethers10. Among cyclic thioethers, 
multidentate heterocycles such as 1,3dithiane and 1,4dithiane have been utilized for this

purpose. However, to the best of our knowledge, 1,3dithiolanes have not been used as ligands in 
AgI complexes. Moreover it received very little attention as potential ligands for transition metal 
ions11.
