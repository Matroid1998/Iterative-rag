Description:
A product of the Haber-Bosch process, contributing to global anthropogenic emissions.

Text:
Ammonia is critical to our food production ecosystem1,2 and the 
single most produced polluting chemical (170 million tons per 
year)35, while also holding the potential to become one of the most 
promising carbonfree and lowcost long term energy carrier6,7. The 
industrial HaberBosch (HB) process employs a Febased catalyst, 
fossilfuel sourced H2, and requires harsh operating conditions 
(typically 673723 K and 100300 bar of pressure). The largescale 
and centralized HB process accounts for nearly 2 of the worlds 
consumption of fossil fuels8, and consequently over 1.44 of the 
global anthropogenic CO2 emissions5. The development of small
scale processes that rely on renewable electricity as an energy source 
to sustainably produce the H2 feedstock would thus be 
transformative in several ways.
