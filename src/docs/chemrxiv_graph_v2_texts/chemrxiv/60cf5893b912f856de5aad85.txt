Description:
Used in isovalent doping to increase electrical conductivity in BiCuSeO.

Doping with group2 ele
ments (Ca, Sr, and Ba) has been successful in optimizing ptype
BiCuSeO.1013 Other efforts to optimize ptype BiCuSeO have in
cluded doping with group1 elements such as Na,1416 K,17,18
and Cs,19 converging the light and heavy hole bands through al
loying with La,20 and increasing the electrical conductivity via
isovalent Ag doping.2123 The widespread success of ptype Bi
CuSeO begs the question of whether BiCuSeO can be doped n
type and if it performs equally well as a TE material. We address
these questions in this study by computing the formation energies
of native defects and 23 dopants in BiCuSeO.
