Description:
A metal center in the Fe(pz)M(CN)4 series that enhances CO2 and CO uptake capacities.

These can undergo a spinstate switch under the influence
of external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, light or
incorporation of guest molecules. The presence of unsatu
rated metal centers can, potentially, enhance the adsorption
capacity, 19 whereas their bistability can be used for sensing
applications. Several studies of gas adsorption have been
published 2026 since their discovery in 2001, 18 including
the interplay between spincrossover and guest molecules. Recently, the member of the series Fe(pz)M(CN)4 with
M  Pt(II) has shown a significant higher CO2 and CO
uptake capacities compared to other MOFs with larger sur
face areas. 27 In this work, we focus our interest in these
Hofmannlike clathrates upon CO2 and CO loading.
