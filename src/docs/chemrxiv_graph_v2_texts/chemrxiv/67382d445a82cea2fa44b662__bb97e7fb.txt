Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, or nimesulide are 
40 
commonly consumed pharmaceuticals. Their widespread use has led to increasing environmental 
41 
concerns, primarily because many of these drugs are excreted unmetabolised entering wastewater 
42 
treatment systems. Their effective removal is challenging while posing potential ecological and health 
43 
hazards due to their persistence and bioactive properties, even at low concentrations. Compared to other 
44 
NSAIDs, nimesulide is known to have potentially toxic effects on aquatic organisms, influencing their 
45 
development and reproductive health 1,2. This emerging contaminant threatens water ecosystems by 
46 
disrupting microbial communities, promoting antibiotic resistance, and negatively impacting aquatic 
47 
organisms 3,4.
