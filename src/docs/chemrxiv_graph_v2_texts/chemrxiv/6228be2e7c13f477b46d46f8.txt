Description:
A marketed kinase inhibitor drug active at various kinases including ALK and ROS1, used in the treatment of NSCLC.

Text:
ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase closely related to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and 
leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) based on sequence similarity of their kinase domains. The ROS1 
protein is composed of an extracellular domain containing several fibronectinlike repeats and a 
cytoplasmic kinase domain. Genomic rearrangements involving ROS1 have been detected in a variety 
of cancers including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and colorectal cancer amongst 
others. Chimeric fusion proteins involving ROS1 fused to the Nterminal domains of different 
unrelated proteins have been shown to be oncogenic1. Marketed kinase inhibitor drugs such as 
Crizotinib and Entrecitinib are active at various kinases including ALK and ROS1 and are used in the 
treatment of NSCLC.
