Description:
Analyte group studied in fish.

Text:
The combination of both approaches has 
been recommended (Zheng et al. 2020). A systematic and thorough comparison between highresolution 
instrumentation and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry 
has only been described for individual analyte groups, e.g., 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers in fish (Mackintosh et al. 2012), 
clinicallyrelevant compounds in plasma (Grund et al. 2016), illicit 
drugs in wastewater (Fedorova et al. 2013), and cathinones in urine
