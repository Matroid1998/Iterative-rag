the unwanted offtargets in human cells, to understand the origin of side effects and develop 
chemical strategies to enhance selectivity towards bacterial cells. FQs inhibit the bacterial topoisomerase IV and gyrase, two enzymes essential for DNA 
replication.7 A crucial motif for the inhibition of both enzymes is the keto acid moiety of FQs, 
which acts as a chelator of activesite Mg2 ions. The keto acid of FQs binds via watermetal 
ion bridges to highlyconserved serine and acidic residues in the subunits A of the typeII 
topoisomerases.8 Consequently, these residues are most frequently mutated in FQresistant 
bacteria, defining the quinolone resistancedetermining region (QRDR).9
