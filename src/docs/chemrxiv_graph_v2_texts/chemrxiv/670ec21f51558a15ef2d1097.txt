Activated porous materials maintain significant academic and industrial interest for 
20 
application in various environmentally relevant gas storage and separation processes, including 
21 
CH4 storage1 and CO2 capture.2,3 Notably, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have accumulated 
22 
considerable research attention owing to numerous attractive properties found within this family 
23 
of modular materials. Their inclination towards permanent porosity and exceptionally high 
24 
achievable surface areas4 renders them desirable for many catalytic and sorptionbased 
25 
applications. For instance, investigations exploring the practicality of MOFs applied to various 
26 
emerging techniques, such as catalysis,5,6 biomedicine,7 and gas storage and separations,8,9 have 
27 
become commonplace.
