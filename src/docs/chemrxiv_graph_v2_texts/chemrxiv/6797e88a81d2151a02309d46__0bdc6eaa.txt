Description:
Molecules that attach fatty acids with the help of lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes.

Text:
For 
example, cells adapt their phospholipid fatty acid (FA) composition to their needs in a biochemical 
cascade termed Lands cylce.4 In this cycle, attachment of FAs to lysolipids occurs with the help of 
lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes. Whereas the involved enzymes in the Lands cycle are 
mostly known, their specificity and selectivity have not been studied in detailed. Zhao et al.
