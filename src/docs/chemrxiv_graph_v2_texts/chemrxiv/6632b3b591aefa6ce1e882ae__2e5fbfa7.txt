To build the simplest safe electrospinning setup, first a 10 M highvoltage resistor was attached 
to a beaker (e.g. simply with duct tape) and one side of the resistor was simply completely inserted into 
the highvoltage cable of the generator purchased online. The other free side of the highvoltage 
resistor was connected to a metallic needle on a 1mL syringe (e.g. simply clipped). The inclination can 
be adjusted by bending the free side of resistor. The collector consists of cardboard covered with 
50 
aluminum foil connected to the ground and fixed to a StyrofoamEPS box. If a laboratory power
