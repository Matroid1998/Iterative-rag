Sulfur
(VI)containing
compounds
such
as
sulfonamide
and
sulfonates have been well established as privileged structural motifs in
numerous FDAapproved drugs, and the synthesis of these compounds
had been explored thoroughly over the past decades.1 In contrast,
sulfonimidamide and sulfonimidate ester, the bioisosteres of sulfonamide
and sulfonate, have been long been neglected in drug discovery due to the
lack of commercial availability and synthetic accessibility.2 Compared to
their oxygenated analogous, these compounds possess unique structural
and physiochemical properties, such as intrinsic stereogenic sulfur centers,
multiple hydrogenbond acceptor and donor functionalities, high stability
and
good
aqueous
solubility.3
Fortunately,
sulfonimidamides,
sulfonimidate esters and other sulfonimindoyl compounds have recently
gained significant attention of medicinal chemists.4 Some of these
sulfonimidoyl derivatives have been successfully used as new drugs and
pesticides.5
Giving
the
growing
significance
of
sulfonimidamides
and
sulfonimidate esters in drug discovery, considerable efforts have been
exerted to develope new method for the synthesis of these sulfur
(VI)containing compounds in recent years.
