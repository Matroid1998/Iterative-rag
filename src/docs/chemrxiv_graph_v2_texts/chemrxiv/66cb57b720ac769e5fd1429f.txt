This belief might be vindicated by the fact that significant 
number of lifesaving drugs have been derived from different plant species, for instance 
antimalarial drugs quinine and quinidine were isolated from Cinchona species and artemisinins 
was isolated from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) (19,20), chemotherapeutic drugs 
vincristine and vinblastine effective for the treatment of several types of cancer such as 
leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumor were isolated from Catharanthus roseus 
(2123), and reserpine which is used to treat high blood pressure was isolated from Rauvolfia 
species (17).
