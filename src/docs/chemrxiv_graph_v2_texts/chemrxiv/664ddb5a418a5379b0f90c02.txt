Description:
Atoms in the isoquinoline core that can be substituted in bioactive compounds.

Text:
Azaarenes with alkyl substitution at different positions are 
important synthetic goals owing to their frequent occurrence in 
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, chiral ligands, catalysts, and 
materials.1 Direct CH alkylation of abundant and inexpensive 
azaarenes is the most attractive approach for sustainable and 
wastefree synthesis.2 Among them, isoquinoline core is present 
in one of the largest numbers of bioactive natural products.3 
Substitution at each carbon of the isoquinoline core is prevalent, 
including metafunctionalized bioactive compounds with sub
stituted alkyl groups.4 Among different CH bonds, ortho and 
paraalkylation were achieved successfully with a broad range 
of electronically and sterically diverse substituents.5 However, 
the metaCH alkylation remained a formidable challenge due 
to its inertness towards both electrophilic and nucleophilic rea
gents.
