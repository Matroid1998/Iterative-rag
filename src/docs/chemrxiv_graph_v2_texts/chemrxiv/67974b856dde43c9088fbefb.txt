Description:
A DNPMRI probe used for simultaneous detection of enzymatic activities and physiological parameters.

Text:
The realization of 
dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) coupled MRI (DNPMRI), which employs 13Clabeled 
hyperpolarized molecular probes to achieve highly sensitive MRI measurements in vivo, has raised ex
pectations for in vivo realtime imaging of enzymatic activities22,23. In 2010, Wilson et al. demonstrated that copolarized four DNPMRI probes, 113Cpyruvate, 1,4
13C2fumarate, 13Curea, and 13Cbicarbonate enabled simultaneous detection of multiple enzymatic ac
tivities and physiological parameters in mice24. More recently, the coinjection of hyperpolarized 1
13Cpyruvate and 13C,15N2urea into patients has been in progress, attracting attention for the potential of 
DNPMRI to simultaneously capture multiple biological parameters, including enzymatic activities25. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025wcbc3 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000302757237 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
