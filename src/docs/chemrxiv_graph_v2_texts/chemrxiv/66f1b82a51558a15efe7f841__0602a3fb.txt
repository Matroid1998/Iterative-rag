Complexes formed in nitric acid solution, with equilibrium impacted by various factors.

Solution chemistry involving the uranyl ion (UO22) and its interactions with the 
surrounding molecules in aqueous environments is important for research in nuclear waste 
management, environmental remediation, and heavy element separations1. Speciation effects on 
UO22 in solution is a multifaceted problem that is still not completely understood. The 
complexation of UO22 in nitric acid solution has been explored 2, 3 where the lowpH 
environment results in the formation of UO22nitrate complexes. However, the equilibrium of 
these complexes in solution can be impacted by many factors. The introduction of additional 
molecules, both as electrolytes and coordinating ligands in solution leads to a variety of physical 
and chemical interactions with UO22 that are difficult to predict.
