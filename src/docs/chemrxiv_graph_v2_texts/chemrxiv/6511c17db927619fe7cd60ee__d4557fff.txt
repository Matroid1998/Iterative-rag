Text:
Methane is the primary hydrocarbon component in natural gas and the second most common anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG), 
after carbon dioxide (US EPA 2023). In 2021, methane represented approximately 17 of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (CCAC 
2021), including emissions from the agriculture, waste, and energy sectors. In the atmosphere, methane has a relatively short 
atmospheric lifetime of approximately 12 years and a higher global warming potential, relative to carbon dioxide (IPCC 2013). Near
term methane reductions have become a focus for many policymakers through efforts like the Global Methane Pledge (CCAC 2021), 
which seeks a 30 reduction in anthropogenic methane emissions across all sectors by 2030 compared to a 2020 baseline.

Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted from anthropogenic sources such as the oil and gas sector.

Governments, 
like the United States (White House 2021), have begun to adopt policies to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions, including from 
the oil and gas sector. In the last few years, the techniques to detect and measure methane emissions have evolved for both scientific studies and operators in 
the United States. For example, a national synthesis study (Alvarez et al. 2018) that provided an estimate of methane emissions from 
natural gas and petroleum systems in the United States in 2015 utilized groundbased measurements from 300 sites across six basins 
to develop its estimate for the production segment. By contrast, more recent scientific studies in the Permian Basin that utilized aircraft
based techniques to screen for methane emissions had much larger sample sizes from 26,000 (Chen et al.
