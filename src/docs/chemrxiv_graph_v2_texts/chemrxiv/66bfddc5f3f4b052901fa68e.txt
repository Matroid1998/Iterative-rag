Description:
A greenhouse gas subject to reporting requirements for emissions greater than 100 kg/hr.

Text:
Updates to the EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) will require oil and
gas operators to report maintenance or abnormal methane emissions greater than 100 kghr
starting in January 2025,1 including emissions identified by third parties (e.g., Carbon Map
per2). With an increasing number of operators opting into voluntary aerial measurement
campaigns and with new methanefocused satellites (e.g., MethaneSAT3) launched and soon
providing publicly available data, the number of detected emissions meeting this reporting
requirement is likely to increase.
