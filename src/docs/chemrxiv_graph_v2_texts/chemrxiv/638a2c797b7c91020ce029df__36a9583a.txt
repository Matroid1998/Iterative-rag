Two-dimensional materials with applications in optoelectronic devices and catalysis.

Text:
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS2, are twodimensional materials with 
exciting perspectives for application in (opto)electronic devices1 or catalysis.2 Within the 
three known polytypes (1T, 2H, and 3R)3 of this material, 2HMoS2 is of particular interest 
due to its semiconducting nature and thicknessdependent band gap.4 Apart from the 
established synthetic pathways toward 2HMoS2 with defined layer thickness, including 
mechanical5 or liquid6 based exfoliation and chemical7 as well as physical vapor 
deposition,8 wetchemical techniques affording colloidally stable TMDCs have recently 
emerged,912 which are based on principles originally developed for the synthesis of colloidal 
quantum dots.13 Some advantages of wetchemically synthesized TMDCs are their scalability, 
relative ease of purification and solutionprocessability, which render them particularly suitable 
for application in LEDs14 or solar cells.15 For these applications, detailed knowledge of the 
electronic structure, such as the exact position of the band edges, is crucial to design efficient 
device stacks, in which the layers of several materials, e.g.
