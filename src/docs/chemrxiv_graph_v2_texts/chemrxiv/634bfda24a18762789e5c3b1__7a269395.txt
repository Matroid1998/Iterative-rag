Description:
Reagents known for their great reactivity in electrophilic group transfers and utility in synthetic chemistry.

Hypervalent iodine compounds (HVI) are wellestablished reagents for synthetic 
chemists. They are portrayed as an alternative to otherwise hazardous transition 
metals. This is due to their great reactivity in electrophilic group transfers 14, photo 
or organocatalysis 515, and their utility as building blocks for the synthesis of natural 
products 1621. One subclass of HVIs is diaryliodonium salts (DIS), which have been 
used as versatile electrophilic arylation reagents in metalcatalyzed and metalfree 
reactions 22, 23. The corresponding cyclic diaryliodonium salts (CDIS) have also 
been investigated as useful building blocks for the synthesis of larger diarylbased 
molecules, (hetero)aromatic tricyclic systems, or new arylmoieties 24, 25. Most 
methods that generate DIS utilize iodoarenes as starting materials 26, 27.
