Description:
An analogue in coordination chemistry known for forming metalloligands.

OMe), whilst larger groups can be used to lock out a particular 
conformer as desired. In most cases, this step would preclude the ability to form polynuclear clusters, so it is 
not of particular relevance to this review and will not be discussed further. The ptertbutylthia, sulfonyl 
and sulfinylcalix4arene analogues have attracted similar interest in coordination chemistry, building on the 
fact that their conformations are equally well understood, but also because a common M4(SSOSO2
TBC4)Cln (n2,3) metalloligand results that can be exploited in directed assembly.3 Notably, this 
metalloligand has been utilised in the formation of a range of spectacular cage structures that have been 
exploited in areas such as selective guest  gas uptake and sorption.
