free).13,14 Poly(triazine imide) (PTIMX) is a layered intercalation 
compound obtained from alkali halide salt melts and can be 
exfoliated to monolayers.15 Even though the material has high 
environmental stability, crystallinity, blue photoluminescence, and 
has found application as semiconductor in photo and 
electrocatalyst, it has found little to no use in optoelectronic 
devices up to this point.1618 In this work, (i) we elucidate the 
impact of different polycondensation conditions on the chemical 
makeup of PTI and its optical and electronic performance, (ii) we 
monitor the material quality at microscopic and macroscopic 
scales, (iii) we assemble photoconductor and organic light 
emitting diode (OLED) devices based on PTI, and (iv) we look at 
the effect of protonation on the electronic structure of PTI 
comparing results from theoretical calculations with observed 
optical spectra.
