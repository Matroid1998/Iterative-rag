Description:
Involved in nitrogen oxidation to form nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of nonthermal plasma and a catalyst.

Text:
The ability of a nonthermal plasma (NTP) and heterogeneous catalyst combination to
achieve reaction yields that exceed the contributions of the individual components is well
documented.1,2 Often reactions are explored at conditions at which background NTP yields
are nonnegligible. Disentangling the gain achieved by combining NTP and catalyst from the
background contributions of NTP and catalyst alone, and inferring the origins of yield en
hancements, are thus signicant practical challenges.35 Here, we demonstrate NTPcatalytic

in a reactor conguration and at conditions in which neither catalyst nor NTP yields sig
nicant product. Observed product yields are thus the result of the mutual action of NTP
and catalyst.
