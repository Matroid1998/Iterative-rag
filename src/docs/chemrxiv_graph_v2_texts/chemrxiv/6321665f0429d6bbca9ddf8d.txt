Description:
Precursors that can be purified from unligated forms by exonuclease digestion or denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Text:
The cDNA prepared by any of these methods can be purified 
from unligated oligonucleotide precursors by either exonuclease digestion or by denaturing 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (28). Bioanalytical RCA techniques involving presynthesized cDNA would not require in 
situ ligation. These assays therefore in principle are faster compared to those involving in situ 
ligation and have seen applications in the biosensing of viruses, microRNA detections, and
