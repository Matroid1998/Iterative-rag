Description:
A pair of peaks appears at 0.680 V (cathodic process) and 0.200 V (anodic process) vs. AgAgCl.

Nevertheless, for Cu(II)Cu(I), a pair of peaks appears at 0.680 V (cathodic process) 
and 0.200 V (anodic process) vs. AgAgCl, respectively, which may enhance the oxidative stress 
and ROS generation.19,20 
The process of enzymatic degradation of A(1x) at positions 4, 11 and 12 also leads to the 
production of a peptide family with very high affinities for Cu(II) ions (stability constant  1014 
M1).21,22,23,24 Due to the presence of an XYH sequence at their Nterminus, called an amino
terminal copper and nickel motif (in short ATCUN), Cu(II) ions are coordinated in a squareplanar 
geometry, which stabilises the Cu(II) and the Cu(II)Cu(III) redox process is seen at a potential of
