Description:
A compound studied for its interaction energy and effect on mobility shifts.

Text:
of SR depend, not only on the ion masses, but on the interaction energies of the 
ionSR adducts. In this study, we introduced five different SRs using ESIIMSMS to study the effect of the 
interaction energy and size on mobility shifts. The mobility shifts showed a decreasing trend as the molecular 
weight increased for the series of compounds ethanolamine, valinol, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, 
tyrosine, tributylamine, tryptophan, desipramine, and tribenzylamine. It was proved that the decreasing trend 
was partially due to the inverse relation between the mobility and drift time and hence, the shift in drift time 
better reflects the pure effect of SR on the mobility of analytes. Yet the drift time shift exhibited a mild 
decrease with the mass of ions.
