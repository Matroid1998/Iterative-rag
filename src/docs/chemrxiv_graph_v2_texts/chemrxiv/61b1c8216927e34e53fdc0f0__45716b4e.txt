Molecular nanomagnets (MNMs) are a research focus of 
scientists due to a variety of potential applications14, including 
molecular spintronics1, 5, 6, highdensity information storage79 , 
quantum information processing or sensing.1016 These systems 
display magnetic hysteresis below their blocking temperature 
(TB) and are magnetically bistable, exhibiting an energy barrier 
to spin reversal (Ueff)1722, ultimately manifested by macroscopic 
quantum tunneling and slow relaxation of magnetization. The 
archetypal Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) is a dodecanuclear 
manganese cluster, Mn12O12(OAc)16(H2O)4 2MeCO2H4H2O, 
magnetically characterized by R. Sessoli, D. Gatteschi et al., 
exhibiting Ueff  60 K and TB3K.23 That discovery led to the 
quest for SMMs with a TB above room temperature. More 
recently, research concentrates on monometallic Single Ion 
Magnets (SIMs) based on the f2427 and d block28, 29 ions.
