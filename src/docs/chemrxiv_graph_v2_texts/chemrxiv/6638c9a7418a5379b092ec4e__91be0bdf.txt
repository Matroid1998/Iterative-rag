Description:
An electron poorer analogue with 7 valence electrons per formula unit, adopting the ZrNiAl type structure.

Text:
The equiatomic ternary phases represent one of the most populated 
intermetallic structural family, with the orthorhombic TiNiSi (ordered 
Co2Si) and the hexagonal ZrNiAl (ordered Fe2P) structure types as the 
most prolific structures, encompassing over 69 of all reported 
equiatomic phases regardless of the compositions.1 In particular, 
some representatives with the TiNiSi type structure can be described 
as electron precise Zintl phase like CaMgGe, EuMgGe and CaAgSb 
with 8 valence electron per formula unit (8 ve f.u). 24 In contrast, 
the electron poorer analogue CaMgGa (7 ve f.u) adopts rather the 
ZrNiAl type structure.
