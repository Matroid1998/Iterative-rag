Description:
Present in stereocenters of synthetic materials and pharmaceuticals, influencing biological activity.

Text:
Phosphorus(V) stereocenters are present in a wide assortment of important synthetic materials, 
including several recently developed pharmaceuticals (Figure 1A). The absolute stereochemistry 
at phosphorus is often directly associated with the biological activity of those molecules (17). Stereogenicatphosphorus compounds also serve as broadly useful ligands and catalysts in 
asymmetric organic synthesis (8, 9). While a variety of natural products bearing Pstereogenic 
centers have been identified (10), these molecules are not practical synthetic building blocks due 
to their sparsity. Thus, while the synthesis of compounds bearing Cstereogenic centers has 
historically drawn heavily on natures chiral pool (11), access to Pstereogenic molecules relies 
entirely on de novo synthesis.

Description:
A central atom in P(V) building blocks used for nucleophilic substitution at stereogenic centers.

Text:
Nucleophilic substitution at stereogenic P(V) centers can occur 
stereospecifically, thereby providing a powerful strategy for the synthesis of complex, optically 
active compounds from simple P(V) building blocks bearing one or more leaving groups attached 
to phosphorus (9, 1113). Effective methods for accessing stereogenicatphosphorus targets have relied primarily on 
the use of covalently attached chiral auxiliaries to achieve diastereocontrol, and a variety of 
chelating auxiliaries have been developed successfully for this purpose (Fig. 1B) (1422). Their 
applicability depends on the ability to achieve stereospecific displacement of the auxiliary to forge 
P(V) stereocenters with absolute stereocontrol. Among noteworthy recent advances using the 
chiral auxiliary approach, Baran and coworkers reported the development of highly reactive 
oxathiaphospholanesulfide building blocks (21, 22).
