Description:
Produced as a gas in water electrolysis cells.

Text:
In conventional water electrolysis cells, hydrogen and oxygen gas are produced from liquid 
water on the electrodes, in the form of bubbles. Gas bubble formation involves a process of 
nucleation and growth, followed by detachment of the bubble from the electrode surface. During that process, the bubbles create a socalled bubble curtain that covers the surface of 
the electrode, blocking electrolyte access by the liquid electrolyte and increasing the resistance 
between the electrodes.14 As a consequence, the energy efficiency of the electrolysis cell is 
decreased. To minimize the negative effect of gas bubbles, many conventional alkaline and 
polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysers continuously pump liquid electrolyte over
