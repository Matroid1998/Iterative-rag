Exhibits amphiphilic behavior, aggregating in aqueous solutions above the critical micellar temperature and concentration.

Text:
While most of the Pluronic members do not exhibit reversible 
thermogelling properties, they do show amphiphilic behaviour, i.e., aggregation in aqueous solutions 
above the critical micellar temperature and concentration. Interestingly, for some of these 
amphiphiles, a progressive transition from spherical micelles towards wormlike micelles upon
