Description:
Conversion to THC appears to not be occurring under realistic consumer exposure conditions.

Text:
For the CBD joints, no THC formation was provable. The recovered THC 
concentrations were ranging between 1 and 48 (0.034 mg and 0.73 mg) of the THC 
amount initially contained in the joints before smoking. Conclusions Using realistic conditions of consumer exposure, relevant conversion of CBD to 
THC appears to not be occurring. The health risk of CBD liquids for electronic cigarettes, as 
well as lowTHC cannabis intended for smoking, can be assessed by concentrations in the 
source material without the need to consider significant changes in psychotropic compounds 
during use by consumers. 3
