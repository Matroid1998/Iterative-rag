Description:
Nanoparticles that penetrate bacterial membranes and propagate a bactericidal effect.

Text:
Part of the numerous microencapsulation technologies developed so far, the solgel 
entrapment of metal nanoparticles in ORMOSIL matrices is particularly advantageous 
due to the pronounced chemical and physical stabilization of the entrapped 
nanoparticles; the lack of toxicity of the hybrid (organicinorganic) organosilica 
material; and the unique versatility of the solgel process that allows to obtain the 
solgel doped material in virtually any shape (powder, film, thin coating, monolith 
etc.) 4. When applied to kill harmful bacteria, Ag NPs penetrate the bacterial membrane and 
accumulate therein. Bacteria killed then act as reservoirs of bactericidal Ag NPs that 
are readily transferred to other bacteria, propagating the bactericidal effect 5.
