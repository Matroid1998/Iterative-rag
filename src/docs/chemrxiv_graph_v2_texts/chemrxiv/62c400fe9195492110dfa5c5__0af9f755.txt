Description:
Serves as a carbon-supported anode material for H2 adsorption.

Text:
Thus, when the anodic reaction is H2 oxidation, 
H2 is adsorbed as atomic H onto the anode (carbonsupported Pt) and the atomic H is subsequently 
converted into H and e. The generated H and e are transferred to the cathode (carbonsupported 
metal, Pd in the present study) through the PEM and an external circuit, respectively, and are
