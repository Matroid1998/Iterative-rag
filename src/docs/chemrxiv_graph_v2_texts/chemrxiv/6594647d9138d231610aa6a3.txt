Description:
A homodimer of tacrine with monomers coupled by a polymethylenic linker.

Text:
Taking as an example, bistacrine is a homodimer of tacrine, and its monomers are 
coupled to one another by means of a polymethylenic linker.2 On the other hand, symbiotically dimerising two 
different pharmacophoric entities gives a conjugate heterodimer.3 This is usually achieved associatively by 
covalently linking one pharmacophore with another, in which two different pharmacophores are readily 
discernible in the resulting heterodimeric conjugate; however, occasionally it is feasible to optimise a dual 
acting lead compound to furnish an inherently dual acting drug for which different pharmacophores are 
indiscernible in the thus obtained heterodimer.
