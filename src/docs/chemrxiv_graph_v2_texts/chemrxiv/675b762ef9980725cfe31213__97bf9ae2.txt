Description:
The olanzapine precursor with the highest number of known polymorphs, also known as ROY due to the red, orange, and yellow color of its crystals.

Text:
These are defined as having nine or more characterized polymorphs such as aripiprazole,7 flufenamic 
acid,8 tolfenamic acid9, galunisertib10 and nicotinamide.11 These highly polymorphic molecules often share 
common structural features, known as a polymorphophore, which may offer some explanation to their 
structural variety.12,13 The small organic molecule with the highest number of known polymorphs is the 
olanzapine precursor 5methyl2((2nitrophenyl)amino)thiophene3carbonitrile (Figure 1), also known as 
ROY due to the red, orange and yellow color of its crystals.14 ROY is the focus of the study presented herein.
