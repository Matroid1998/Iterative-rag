Description:
Used in crystallisation buffer at a concentration of 22% w/v.

Text:
Electrochemical potential were applied with an AutoLab 128 N 
potentiostat (Metrohm) controlled by NOVA software (v 1.10) Electrochemical potentials (E) were 
measured with a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and potentials quoted in the text 
adjusted to mV vs the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) using the conversion E (mV vs SHE)  E (mV 
vs SCE) 241 mV at 25 C.50 
Purification and crystallisation of Hyd1 and Hyd2 
Proteins were expressed, purified, and crystallised as described previously,44,51 with all asisolated 
crystals predominantly in the NiB state, as assessed by IRspectroscopy.10 
Electrochemical poising of Hyd1 crystals 
A solution (5 mL) containing appropriate redox mediator(s) (Table S6), each at 1 mM concentration, 
was prepared in N2 saturated crystallisation buffer (100 mM BisTris, pH 6, 200 mM Li2SO4, 150 mM 
NaCl, 22 wv PEG 3350, 15 vv glycerol) and transferred into the electrochemical cell in a N2filled 
glovebox (Belle Technologies or Glove Box Technologies, O2 3 ppm).
