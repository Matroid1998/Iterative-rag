Description:
Compounds that undergo rapid photopolymerization with high yields and minimal byproducts.

The 3D 
object is thus obtained by the crosslinking of a liquid resin 
consisting mainly of multifunctional (meth)acrylates derivatives. The photopolymerization of acrylates occurs rapidly, with high 
yields, and generates almost no byproducts. This led to a cross
linked material whose mechanical properties could be tuned by 
the monomers structure. Moreover, such object is constituted by 
a CC bond covalent network that impart a high thermal and 
chemical stability. This permanent crosslinked network could 
also be detrimental for diverse reasons. First the high stability is 
incompatible with facile degradability and reupcyclability.
