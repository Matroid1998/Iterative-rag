Description:
Undergo reversible dehalogenation to form epoxides catalyzed by halohydrin dehalogenases.

For this reason, protein 
engineering is often vital to adjust the enantioselectivity of a native enzyme (along with other 
enzyme characteristics) to fulfill the requirements of an industrial biocatalytic process.69 
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) have gained increasing attention in recent years for their 
application in the synthesis of a plethora of valuable products.10 Naturally, those enzymes 
catalyze the reversible dehalogenation of haloalcohols with formation of the corresponding 
epoxides.11 In the reverse reaction, a range of small C, O, N and Snucleophiles, such as 
azide, cyanide, nitrite, cyanate and thiocyanate (known as pseudohalogens), are also accepted 
for epoxide ring opening in addition to halide ions (Figure 1A).12 This enabled the preparation 
of enantioenriched nitroalcohols,13 cyanohydrins,14 oxazolidinones15 and thiiranes16 
amongst others,1720 fueled by the recent discovery of many new HHDHs from public sequence 
databases.13,2124 In most of these cases, however, protein engineering of the initially identified 
enzymes with highest activity was still necessary to achieve also high enantioselectivity.

Description:
Naturally occurring compounds that are presumably detoxified and degraded by native HHDHs.

Apart 
from a few examples,13,2529 most native HHDHs do not display high enantioselectivity as this 
would contradict their assumed natural function, which is presumably the detoxification and 
degradation of (naturally occurring) haloalcohols.30,31 
Many examples for the protein engineering of selected HHDHs, such as HheC from 
Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, have been reported in literature that do not only focus on 
enantioselectivity but also on activity and stability.3239 Of these examples, the majority profited 
from the previously solved crystal structures of respective enzymes.
