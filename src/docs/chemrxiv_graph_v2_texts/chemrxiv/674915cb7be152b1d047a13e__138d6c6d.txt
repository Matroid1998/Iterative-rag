Description:
A nucleoside analog used in systemic chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer.

Text:
. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare and aggressive form of biliary tract cancer. Standard of care chemotherapy for patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract 
cancer is systemic treatment with nucleoside analogs such as capecitabine and gemcitabine in 
combination 
with 
platinum 
complexes 
such 
as 
cisplatin 
and 
oxaliplatin 
(httpswww.cancer.govtypesliverbileductcancer). Median survival following diagnosis 
remains less than a year.1 The search for dominant molecular alterations that may play a critical 
role in driving tumorigenesis has revealed that mutations within the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes 
1 and 2 (IDH12) are often present in ICC that are refractory to chemotherapy.
