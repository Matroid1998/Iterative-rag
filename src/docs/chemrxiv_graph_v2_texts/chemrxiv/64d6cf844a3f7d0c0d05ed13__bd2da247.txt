Description:
A coating material used in NanoSIMS substrates.

This process ejects secondary ions, which are then 
separated by a mass analyzer, allowing for up to seven 
individual species to be detected simultaneously. The high 
sensitivity and mass precision of the NanoSIMS 50L allows for 
compositional information of individual bilayers to be 
obtained34,35. For the experiments reported here, GUVs formed 
via either gentle hydration or electroformation were exposed to 
NanoSIMS substrates (10 nm SiO2 coated Si) where they 
rupture to form supported bilayer patches whose area reflects 
the surface area of the parent GUV. This process is depicted in 
Figure 1. In parallel, continuous supported bilayers (SLBs) 
were formed by conventional small vesicle fusion. SIMS can 
then be used to examine the compositional variability of the 
resulting SLBs formed via different methods.
