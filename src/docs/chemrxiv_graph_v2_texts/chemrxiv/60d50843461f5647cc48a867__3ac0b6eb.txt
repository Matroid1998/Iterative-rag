Description:
Compounds known for their ability to stabilize reactive inorganic fragments.

Text:
The unique features of anionic phosphinimides (PN)  
also known as imidophosphoranes  warrant further con
sideration in the stabilization of reactive inorganic frag
ments.12 The two canonical resonance structures of PNs 
(Fig 1A) highlight their ability to act as 1, 3, or 5 electron 
donors, attendant with the diversity of observed PNM 
metal binding modes (Fig 1B).
