Description:
A component of the complex designed by Qu et al.

Text:
These rigid, heterocycles contribute to 
suppressing nonradiaTve intramolecular decay modes, aording complexes with higher FPL and 
showing relaTvely narrowband emission, which ulTmate leads to OLEDs showing greater color 
saturaTon and higher eciency (Figure 1).7 
For instance, Qu et al. designed a methyl and tertbutyldecorated iCzpyridyl containing complex 
bearing an ancillary nonchromophoric 2,2,6,6tetramethyl3,5heptanedione (tdm) ligand Ir(py
iCz)2(tdm) (Figure 1).8 This yellowemiPng complex (PL  567 nm in DCM) shows reasonably 
narrowband emission (FWHM  42 nm in DCM). AddiTonally, parasubsTtuTon on the pyridyl moiety 
of the ligand permits facile color tuning to the orange (R  CF3, PL  577 nm in DCM) and red (R  TMS, 
PL  620 nm in DCM).
