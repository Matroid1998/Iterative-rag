Description:
An element represented by X in the ((ZnX2)3(tpt)2 x(solvent))n system.

The technique removes the necessity of sample crystallisa
tion by utilising the porosity of crystalline metalorganic frame
works (MOFs) to form hostguest complexes with the desired
compound, which can then be analysed by SCXRD.2 The CS
method is particularly useful in pharmaceutical research, where
knowing the exact structure and stereochemical information of a
molecule is of critical importance. The most successful and generally applicable MOF used for
the CS method is the ((ZnX2)3(tpt)2 x(solvent))n system, (tpt
 2,4,6tris(4pyridyl)1,3,5triazine ligand; X  I, Br, Cl). The
system has several advantageous properties including large, hy
drophobic pores (5 x 8 ) with electrondeficient binding sites
offered by the tpt ligand.
