Description:
Acts as a cathode in waterline corrosion when present in ample amounts above the water level.

Text:
The metal which is more reactive gets corroded fast while 
other metals get protected5. This is also called bimetallic corrosion. Erosion type of corrosion 
occurs due to mechanical movement of corrosive fluid through the metal. This happens when 
mechanical friction between metal and particles of the corrosive fluids takes place11.Waterline 
corrosion occurred in metallic water storage tanks when filled partially. Area below the water 
surface acts as anode because it has exposure to very little oxygen while area above the water 
level has ample of oxygen and thus acts as cathode and thus corrosion occurs just below the 
water surface called as water line corrosion5. Antifouling coating is the best choice of coating 
formulators and scientist to avoid water line corrosion.
