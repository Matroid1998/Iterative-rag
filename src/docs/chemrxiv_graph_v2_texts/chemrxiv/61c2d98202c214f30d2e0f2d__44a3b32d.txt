Description:
A unit that is isoelectronic with two carbon atoms and can be doped into aromatic compounds to tune their properties.

Text:
Chemically doping heteroatoms into aromatic compounds has 
proven to be one of the most effective methods to tune their 
optoelectronic properties and intermolecular interactions.1 
Due to the isoelectronic relationship between boron and carbon 
cation as well as between boronnitrogen (BN) unit and two 
carbon atoms (CC) motif, boron becomes an important element 
that can induce novel and complementary properties.2 BN
doped aromatic compounds have a long history of evolution 
since the first example of BNarene was reported by Alfred 
Stock in 1926.3 Much the same to many other topics of 
chemistry, not much attention was paid until the new 
millennium.
