Poly and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a group of persistent organic 
46 
pollutants characterized by strong and stable chemical bonds between carbon and fluorine 
47 
atoms.15 These substances exhibit remarkable resistance to environmental degradation due to 
48 
their robust chemical structure, and lack of evolutionary pressure which renders them resistant 
49 
to heat, alkali, and acid.6 Consequently, PFAS have found widespread use in various industrial 
50 
applications, including nonstick cookware,7 food packaging,2,8,9 aqueous filmforming foam,9 
51 
plastics,10 and semiconductor manufacturing.11,12 Since the 1940s,7 the discharge of PFAS from 
52 
commercial and industrial sources has led to their widespread presence in water sources 
53 
worldwide, with concentrations ranging from ngL to sometimes gL levels.2,4 PFAS 
54 
contamination has been detected in various water sources, including drinking water, 
55 
groundwater, surface water, tap water, and industrial effluents, prompting the establishment of 
56 
environmental quality standards, and guidelines in many countries.2,1315 Recognized as 
57 
emerging contaminants, some classes of PFAS, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and 
58 
perfluorooctane sulfonate acid (PFOS), pose significant health and environmental risks due to 
59 
their carcinogenic properties.1621 However, the environmental persistence and bioaccumulative 
60 
nature of all PFAS make them worrisome for future generations, as these chemicals do not 
61 
readily degrade and can accumulate in the environment over time.

Description:
A group of chemicals subject to national drinking water standards with mandatory monitoring and compliance.

Text:
In 2016, the US 
67 
EPA established a drinking water health advisory level of 70 ngL for the combined 
68 
concentrations of PFOA and PFOS.26 The US EPA recently established the firstever national 
69 
drinking water standard for PFAS, which will go into effect with mandatory monitoring by 2027 
70 
and compliance by 2029, with specific maximum contaminant levels for PFOA, and PFOS at 4.0 
71 
parts per trillion.27 As a result of these regulations, researchers worldwide are actively seeking 
72 
effective treatment techniques to remove PFAS from water sources. 73 
The predominant focus of recent research lies in investigating the efficacy of various 
74 
technologies for removing PFAS, encompassing adsorption, membrane filtration, destructive 
75 
processes, and other methodologies.
