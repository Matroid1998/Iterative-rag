Description:
A thermoplastic polyolefin with good chemical resistance and easy processing.

Antioxidants are classified into two categories according to 
their modes of action with (i) primary antioxidants, which have the ability to neutralize all or 
some of the radicals (R, RO, ROO, HO) by proton transfer, and (ii) secondary antioxidants, 
which break down the formed hydroperoxides (ROOH). Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs), such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE), and 
thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) are among the worlds most widely used thermoplastics. Together, they account for more than half of all thermoplastics produced. They stand out for 
their excellent performance, with a wide range of mechanical and thermal properties, good 
chemical resistance, and an easy processing. However, if not formulated, these neat polymers 
could not be so widely used alone.
