Description:
Involved in lithiation-delithiation processes that form nanocrystals in glass matrices, enhancing ionic conductivity and structural stability of anode materials.

Recently, our group found that the lithiationdelithiation induced 
the formation of nanocrystals in the glass matrix of anode material. These nanocrystals greatly 
contribute to the reduction of Liion diffusion path length, improvement of the ionic conductivity and 
maintaining the structural stability of the anode materials over multiple chargedischarge cycles 
1,14,15. However, the reversible capacity of oxide glass anode, especially its volumetric lithium 
storage, is still far from the requirement for miniaturization of energy storage devices 16,17. In 
particular, the limited capacity of glass anode is related to their poor ionic conductivity at the ultrahigh 
current density, which results in slow transfer kinetics of Li ions. These problems severely limit the 
practical applications of LIBs with competent rate capability and ultrahigh cycling stability.
