Description:
Used in Nicatalyzed redox-neutral C(sp3)C(sp2) crosscoupling reactions with organic halides.

Text:
Directly employing electrodes as both the oxidant and reductant, paired redoxneutral 
electrolysis offers an attractive platform for CC crosscoupling reactions because it avoids the 
need for stoichiometric amounts of sacrificial oxidants and reductants.1013 In paired electrolysis, 
highly reactive intermediates such as catalyst intermediates and carbon radicals are formed in situ 
through electrochemical reactions. No strong reagents or sensitive precatalysts are required in the 
reactions.10,11 Previously, Hu et al. and our group independently reported anodic oxidation of 
nucleophiles and cathodic reduction of organic halides to enable efficient Nicatalyzed redox
neutral C(sp3)C(sp2) crosscoupling reactions between toluene derivatives or benzyl 
trifluoroborate and organic halides, respectively (Scheme 1C).14,15 However, the limited flexibility 
of the toluene derivative substrates and inconvenient synthesis of trifluroborate nucleophiles
