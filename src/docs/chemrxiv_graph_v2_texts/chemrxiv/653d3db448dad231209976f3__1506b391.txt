Description:
A heavy Rare Earth Element.

Lanthanides, because of their unique properties, have a wide range of applications in several areas of 
medicine; 16 biology; 13 imaging techniques 14 such as computed tomography (CT) scans, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and Xrays; and hi
tech industries 710 such as in highstrength permanent magnets, superconductors, and electronic 
devices. Lanthanides are also known as Rare Earth Elements (REEs)  although formally REEs also 
include scandium and yttrium. Based on the atomic numbers, REEs can be divided into two categories 
light REEs (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and heavy REEs (Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y). Monazite, 
xenotime, bastnasite, etc. are naturally occurring REE sources containing up to 70 rare earth oxides 
(REOs).
