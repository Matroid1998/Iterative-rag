Description:
A conjugated polymer known for its easy processability and applications in organic electronics.

Text:
Conjugated polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), 
poly(3hexylthiophene2,5diyl) (P3HT), and PEDOTPSS, are well known for their easy 
processability and have been coated on rigid, flexible, and stretchable substrates23. The versatility 
and promising capability of solution processability in various fields have sparked research 
interests and demonstrated applications in organic electronics24, solar cells2529, flexible 
electronics30, 
optoelectronics3133, 
plasmonics34,35, 
metamaterials36, 
and 
electrochromic 
devices37,38. Despite these advancements, leveraging conjugated polymerbased electrochromic 
devices for dynamic thermoregulation on nonplanar or threedimensional surfaces presents an 
unresolved challenge. 3
