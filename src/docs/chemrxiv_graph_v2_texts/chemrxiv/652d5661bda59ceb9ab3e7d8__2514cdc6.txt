Description:
Transforms from an inorganic state (CO2) to an organic state by forming a CC bond during photosynthesis.

Text:
Every carbon atom in materials or living organisms that surrounds us was part of a CO2 molecule 
in the past, and has been captured by some autotrophic organism during the second step of 
photosynthesis (CalvinBenson cycle1). This complicated process transforms carbon from an 
inorganic state (CO2) to an organic state by forming a CC bond, and is thus directly or indirectly 
the prime source of growth of all living organisms. Three different mechanisms of carboncapture 
are used during photosynthesis C3, C4 and CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). 97 of plant 
varieties belongs to the C3 family and simultaneously captures and integrates the atmospheric CO2 
in the organism via the enzyme Rubisco2.

Description:
A key element involved in terrestrial carbon fixation processes.

Text:
Even if CO2capture with the C4 or 
CAM mechanisms is found in only 3 of plant varieties, C4 plants represent 23 of terrestrial 
carbon fixation2, including plants of huge importance such as sugarcane, maize (which is the most 
grown cereal in the world5, used to feed humans and livestock), millet (which is one of the only 
edible plant that can grow in arid regions) or switchgrass (which is a serious candidate for 
developing the production of biocarburant6). The reaction catalysed by PEPC is thus at a central 
corner for both food and resource productions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023kl8vh ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000240905897 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
