Description:
A donor group that can result in destructive quantum interference features in electron transmission when attached to a polyacetylene chain.

Text:
However, the electronic states of the adsorbed
molecules can result in different phenomena in the device, such as quantum interference (QI)
effects and scattering.1921 Thus, an understanding of the spinpolarized quantum transport
properties of such systems is required. SaraivaSouza et al. reported that the presence
of an imidazole donor group to the polyacetylene chain connected to the ZGNR electrodes
can result in destructive quantum interference (DQI) features in the electron transmission
