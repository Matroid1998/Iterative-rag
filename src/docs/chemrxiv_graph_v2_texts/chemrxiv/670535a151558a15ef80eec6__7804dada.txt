Description:
Used in halogen-based flame retardant additives to reduce flammability of polymer materials.

Text:
Polymers are used in several industrial applications such as transport, building, electrical and 
household appliances mainly because they are light in weight, do not corrode, can be tailormade 
based on the applications, easy and cheap to produce and easy to recycle. However, they are 
flammable, causing severe casualties and property damages because they are organic. Flame 
retardant (FR) additives are therefore used to reduce the flammability of polymer materials. The 
main safety philosophy behind the use of such FR additives is to prevent ignition and limit fire spread 
if ignition occurs. This requirement is frequently fulfilled today by using halogenbased FR additives, 
based on chlorine and bromine compounds.
