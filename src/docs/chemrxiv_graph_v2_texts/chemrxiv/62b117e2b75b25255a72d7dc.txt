Description:
A bile acid that can conjugate with amino acids in the gut.

BA metabolism mechanism by which unique amino acid conjugated cholic acid, due
12
to the discovery of three new amino acidconjugated bile acids (AABAs) synthesized
13
in the gut under the mediation of gut microbiota, including phenylalanocholic acid,
14
tyrosocholic acid, and leucocholic acid20. This discovery changed the conventional
15
view that free BAs solely conjugate glycine or taurine in the liver. Our recent study
16
has also discovered and characterized two novel amino acid conjugations (alanine
17
conjugation and proline conjugation) with host BAs in mouse intestinal contents and
18
feces using our developed alternating dualCE scanning MS approach21. These
19
findings shed a light on the exploration of the gut metabolome.
