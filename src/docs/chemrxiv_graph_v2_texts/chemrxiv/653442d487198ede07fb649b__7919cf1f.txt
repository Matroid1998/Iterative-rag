Description:
An olefin used as a feedstock in the copolymerization with ethylene.

Text:
As compared to HDPE, ethyleneolefin copolymers 
produced atscale by direct copolymerization of ethylene and olefins have a broader range of 
applications as well as highvalue polyolefin elastomer (POE) and robust olefin block 
copolymer (OBC) thermoplastic elastomer (plastomer) materials, but chemical or mechanical 
recycling of such copolymers is considerably more challenging due to their chemical and 
structural heterogeneity. Hence, there is a pressing need to render such materials chemically 
circular but achieving such a desirable goal presents a particular challenge, due to difficulties 
in introducing controllable branches, while simultaneously installing chemical circularity, and 
also in primarily using industrially abundant and inexpensive feedstocks, ethylene and olefins 
such as 1hexene or 1octene.
