Description:
Forms a matrix assumed to be graphenelike in FeNC catalysts.

The
isomer shift depends linearly on the selectron density at the
nucleus, while the quadrupole splitting is defined by the elec
tric field gradient, making it highly sensitive to the symme
try of the electron distribution around the nucleus.2427 Both
Mssbauer parameters show a temperature dependence, mak
ing low temperature experiments on FeNC catalysts highly rele
vant for comparisons with computational data that are formally
carried out at 0 K.6,28
The currently dominant perspective on active sites in FeNC
catalysts is that iron atoms are surrounded by a fourfold nitro
gen coordination sphere that are embedded in a carbon ma
trix, which is assumed to be graphenelike5,6,11,12,14,2022,29.
