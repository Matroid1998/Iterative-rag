Description:
Generally poor electron donors and acceptors due to their low polarizability.

Alkane complexes play a critical role in CH bond activation 
reactions with transition metal complexes. They constitute the 
decisive intermediates in which an alkane CH bond directly 
coordinates and interacts with the transition metal13. Due to 
their low polarizability, however, alkanes are generally poor 
electron donors and acceptors. The bond strength between the 
metal and the alkane CH bond in complexes is therefore typ
ically very weak. Still, the subtle degree of polarization induced 
in the CH bond through binding to the metal site in complex 
intermediates critically determines the reactivity towards bond 
cleavage in CH activation reactions4.

Description:
CH bonds in alkanes can act as ligands bound to a metal center.

In pursuit of understand
ing this unusual bonding configuration, a rich literature of com
plexes, in which alkane CH bonds act as ligands bound to a 
metal center, has emerged over the decades3,57. Various routes exist towards preparation of alkane com
plexes. Direct preparation in the solid state has been achieved 
by hydrogenation of metalbound alkenes8,9 as well as in solu
tion via protonation of a metalbound alkyl group at very low 
temperature10. The most common routes to preparing alkane 
complexes, however, are photochemical ones3 (see Scheme 1). The photoinduced elimination of a ligand from certain transi
tion metal complexes leads to the creation of an 
undercoordinated and highly reactive species capable of bind
ing an alkane from solution.
