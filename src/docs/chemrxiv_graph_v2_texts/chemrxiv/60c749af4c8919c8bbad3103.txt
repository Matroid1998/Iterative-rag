Description:
A core structure used in the design of a pseudoC5 symmetrical ligand.

In this work, we introduced geometric frustration 
through a linker with preudoC5 symmetry, as the 
symmetry cannot be propagated to a classical peri
odic lattice basedon translation, while periodic lat
tices based on rotation and translation such as in a 
quasicrystal could support this symmetry.11,15 Sev
eral strategies exist for the introduction of C5 sym
metry in organic building blocks,1619 as these are 
used for the synthesis of large cage coordination 
compounds.18,20,21 As introducing C5symmetry can 
be synthetically challenging,19,22 instead we designed 
a pseudoC5 symmetrical ligand based on a pyrrole 
core (see method section, Figure S1). The pseudoC5 
symmetric linker containing pendant carboxylic acid 
groups, 1,2,3,4,5penta (4(benzoic acid))pyrrole 
(pLH5; Figure 1) was reacted with copper(II) ions as 
a synthon for the C4 symmetric paddlewheel motif.
