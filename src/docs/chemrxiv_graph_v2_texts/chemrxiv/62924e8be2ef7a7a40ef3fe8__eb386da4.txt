Description:
Difficult to insert or extract from host materials due to its larger ionic radius, impacting mass transport and kinetics.

However, the
larger ionic radius of the Na ion (1.02 ) than the Li ion (0.76 ) makes it difficult to insert or
extract the sodium ions from the host material, affecting the mass transport, storage, and overall
kinetics.14,15 Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials with superior electrochemical
properties is crucial for making NIBs with commercial applications. Several recent studies have
made progress on both cathode and anode materials of NIBs.1619 However, significant efforts
are still required to find new anode materials with high specific charge capacities and lower
redox potentials (closer to the NaNa redox couple). In a recent study,20 Jinxing et al. discovered a new class of materials called antiMXenes,
with promising electrochemical and catalytic applications.
