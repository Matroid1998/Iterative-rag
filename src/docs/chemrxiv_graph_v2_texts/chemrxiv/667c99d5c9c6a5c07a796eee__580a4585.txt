The excessive reliance on fossil fuels has led to severe environmental pollution and global 
warming, creating an urgent need for renewable and clean energy sources as alternatives1,2. Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy carrier for meeting clean energy demands due to 
its high energy density and environmentally benign properties3. Electrocatalytic hydrogen 
production offers an economical and efficient approach to achieving a closed carbon cycle4. Currently, platinum (Pt) stands as the most efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER) in acidic media due to its favorable electronic structure, which facilitates 
moderate binding energy with hydrogen ions, a crucial attribute for achieving efficient catalytic 
performance5,6.
