Description:
Forms charge transfer complexes with other PCBM molecules.

However, as the species involved in the
proposed process are difficult to experimentally identify, the exact
mechanism remains to be verified. A more detailed understand
ing of the underlying microscopic mechanisms may allow further
optimization of this new doping method and may also play a role
in further optimization of electrophilic attack and Lewisacid dop
ing. Here we present an indepth investigation of the electronic
structure of the deprotonated PCBM and its formation of CT com
plexes with PCBM molecules. We find that the electronic behavior
