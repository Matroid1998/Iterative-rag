Description:
A class of organic compounds with multiple aromatic rings.

Text:
Inspired by the shotgun approach to 
macrocycle,7,8 
which 
involves 
using 
a 
onepot 
multicomponent cyclization of small monomers, to access 
the macrocycle. This approach shows great advantages to 
quick constructing different size macrocycle. In addition, 
phenanthrene as an important polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon (PAH), which with armchair side. We envision 
that 
1,8diaryl 
phenanthrene 
derivative 
would 
be 
promising building blocks for GNRs, which are readily 
available.9 Herein, we report a series of arcuate GNRs with 
thiophenebackbones, achieved by Shotgun approach 
with high efficiency. The precursor of GNRs was 
constructed by the SuzukiMiyaura coupling with 1,8diaryl 
phenanthrene 
as 
key 
building 
block 
and 
then 
dehydrocyclization to obtain GNRs of different lengths.
