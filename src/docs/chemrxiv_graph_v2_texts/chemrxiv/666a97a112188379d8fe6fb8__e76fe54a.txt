Description:
An amphiphilic block copolymer capable of forming different assemblies in solution upon photoisomerization.

Text:
studied an alternating azo 
copolymer that can undergo a photoinduced deformation.40 
The amphiphilic epoxybased alternating azo copolymer can 
assemble in water into colloidal spheres which deform into 
ellipsoids under irradiation with an Ar laser at 488 nm. It has 
also been reported that assembled alternating copolymers or 
BCP structures containing azobenzene can be disassembled 
and reassembled by irradiation.28,4144 
In this study, we report AAPbearing amphiphilic BCPs 
capable of forming different assemblies in solution upon 
photoisomerization of the AAP. To this end, a library of 
different 
amphiphilic 
poly(oligo(ethylene 
glycol) 
methacrylateblockpoly(arylazopyrazole 
tetra(ethylene 
glycol) 
methacrylate) 
(POEGMAbPAAPMA) 
was 
synthesized with AAPs incorporated into the hydrophobic 
block. The configuration of the AAP can be altered by green 
light (520 nm, E isomer) and UV light (365 nm, Z isomer).
