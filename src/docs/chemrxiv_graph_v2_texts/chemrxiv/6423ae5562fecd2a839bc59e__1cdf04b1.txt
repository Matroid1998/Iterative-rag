Description:
A group found in perfluoroalkyl compounds contributing to their persistence as environmental pollutants.

Text:
Perfluoroalkyl compounds that contain at least one CF3 or difluoromethylene group 
are recognized as persistent environmental pollutants. Many organofluorine compounds 
have been produced in the chemical industry, as their unique chemical, physical, and 
physiological properties have found various applications in pharmaceuticals, 
agrochemicals, surfactants, refrigerants, and polymers.1,2 One of the most remarkable 
properties of perfluoroalkyl substances is their chemical and thermal stability, which is 
derived from the strong C(sp3)F bonds. However, the inertness of these materials 
hampers their destruction.
