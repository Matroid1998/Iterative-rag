Description:
A gas that competes with water for Mg2 sites in the MOF structure.

Text:
Although this interaction allows for high 
CO2 uptake mechanism, it is the Achilles heel of the material as it 
results in (1) ease of hydrolysis of the MOF backbone, and (2) com
petition of water to CO2 for Mg2 sites, and therefore the loss of 
amines.35,37 Furthermore, the MgMOF74 system and their deriva
tives require heating to 140240 C for regeneration.21,3235 Here, we 
use a robust MOF808 Zr6O4(OH)4(BTC)2(HCOO)6, BTC  
1,3,5benzenetricarboxylate system38 and bind the amino acids 
through their carboxylates to Zr(IV) centers to create Zr(IV)
carboxylate interactions, which are 23 times stronger than the 
Mg(II)amine interactions.3941 The fact that the amino residue of 
the amino acid is dangling into the pores creates a basic environment 
for CO2 binding in the presence of water.
