Text:
4Phenoxy ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in synthesis of 
fully substituted anilines via DBUmediated 4  2 annulations of donoracceptor 
cyclopropanes with 3aryl2cyanoacrylates 1, and in studies of quinolin2(1H)one 
derivatives related to synthetic access to pyrano3,2c quinoline and 3substituted quinoline 
compounds 2. 4Acetoxy ethyl PCA is mentioned in microwavepromoted sequential 
threecomponent synthesis of tetrahydrobenzobpyran in water catalyzed by heterogeneous 
amine grafted on silica 3. 4Methoxyphenyl decyl PCA is patented as retardation film, 
method of producing the retardation film, and polarizing plate and liquidcrystal display 
device 4, and liquid crystal display device 5. 4Diethylamino PCA is reported in high 
speed PVKbased photorefractive polymer composites 6; in studies of photorefractive 
properties of poly(nvinyl carbazole)based composites for highspeed applications 7; in 
catalysis study of Knoevenagel condensation 8, 9.
