A component of OCT media used for embedding tissues.

Freshfrozen (FF) tissue preparations have been the longstanding gold standard for the 
49 
analysis of nucleic acids and proteins.1 This also carries over to various forms of biomolecular 
50 
imaging, including spatial metabolomics and lipidomics.2, 3 However, tissues that have 
51 
undergone extensive clinical studies are often not preserved in a manner that is directly 
52 
compatible with newer multiomics assays, such as mass spectrometry (MS) or MS imaging 
53 
(MSI). A common approach for preserving morphology and anatomical features of FF tissues 
54 
postsurgical dissection or resection is embedding within optimal cutting temperature (OCT) 
55 
media.4 OCT media is a mixture of various molecular weight polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 
56 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers.
