estingly, while the MgCu2 is the 5th most common binary inter
metallic structure type 20, only a few of the known compounds 
feature a pblock element occupying the pyrochlore network  
besides the three dibismuthides, these are MgIn2 21, SnS2 22, and 
RAl2, (R  Sr, Ba, rareearth metals, Th, U). Here we present the results of our experimental and computa
tional studies on RbBi2 and CsBi2, concentrated on the effects 
of strong SOC on superconducting properties. We show that in 
both compounds superconductivity emerges from the Bi42 py
rochlore lattice and that the relativistic effects play a complex 
role in stability and properties of the two phases.
