Description:
Can offer a direct alternative to palladium due to being in the same periodic triad.

Text:
Molecular palladiumbased transitionmetal catalysts are prevalent in fine chemical synthesis and 
widely used in SuzukiMiyaura, Heck, and BuchwaldHartwig coupling to name a few examples.13 
Molecular palladium catalysts are also found in commodity chemical reactions such as the Wacker 
oxidation.4 The wide use of palladium catalysts is due to relatively predictable catalyst properties and the 
propensity to undergo Pd(II0) cycles. However, due to the high cost and rarity of palladium, researchers 
have pursued the discovery of more sustainable and less expensive catalysts containing first row transition 
metals.59 In addition, despite the ubiquity of molecular palladium catalysts, the nuclearity of the palladium 
active sites (i.e. molecular versus nanoparticle) is commonly questioned.1012 Nickel can offer a direct 
alternative to palladium due to being in the same periodic triad.

Description:
Molecular nickel catalysts can access a variety of oxidation states and one-electron reactivity.

Text:
Molecular nickel catalysts are also less 
susceptible to nucleation due to the distinct differences in redox properties between nickel and palladium.12
13 These redox property differences also allow molecular nickel complexes to access a variety of oxidation 
states and oneelectron reactivity, which is rarer for palladium catalysts. Molecular nickel catalysts can thus 
access different reactivity compared to palladium catalysts such as more facile activation of arylchlorides 
and phenol derivatives,1415 and incorporation into photoredox catalysis cycles.1618
