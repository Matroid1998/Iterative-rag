Description:
Used by Cytochrome P450 as fuel for the efficient oxidation of several compounds.

Cytochrome P450 is natures ultimate enzyme which can catalyse a plethora of chemical 
reactions.15 It is biological machinery that works in a wellorganized catalytic cycle by using 
molecular oxygen and water molecules as fuel for the efficient oxidation of several compounds 
of commercial and medicinal importance.612 Due to the catalytic versatility of P450 enzymes 
it is no surprise that Cytochrome P450 is the most widely used scaffold for bioengineering of 
new catalytic functions.1315 Recently, three members of the CYP450 superfamily; a P450OleT 
from peroxygenase family1617, a P450GcoA from CYP255A2 1820 and AgcA from CYP255A121 
family were found to catalyse reactions of potential biofuel importance.
