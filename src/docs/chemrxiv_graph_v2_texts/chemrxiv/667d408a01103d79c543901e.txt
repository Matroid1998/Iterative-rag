Description:
A guest molecule that forms clathrates with hydroquinone under mild pressure.

Text:
Clathrates are crystalline materials consisting of a porous
framework, built up by discrete molecules, that adsorb guest
molecules in their pores (13). The framework acts as a host
for the relatively weakly bound gaseous guests. In the absence of directional interactions between molecules,
and disregarding lattice vibrations, the densest crystal struc
ture of any given composition is the most stable one (4, 5). Consequently, the empty host frameworks are generally un
stable and clathrates are rare (6, 7). Hydroquinone is one of the few widely known clathrate
forming molecules (8). It has been extensively studied both
experimentally and computationally. Hydroquinone easily
forms clathrates with a large number of guests, including
CO2 under mild pressure (9).

Description:
A gas that can be captured from flue gas or separated from biogas using clathrate hydrates.

Text:
More recently, additives that induce the formation
of clathrate hydrates have been studied as a means to cap
ture CO2 from ue gas or for separating CO2 from biogas
precombustion (20). Computational studies of clathrates have mainly focused on
the calculation of guest adsorption energies by traditional
force eld methods. The adsorption energy is calculated ei
ther from the static lattice energy (21, 22), or with methods
that consider the dynamics and generate a thermodynamic
ensemble, such as molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations (2325). Lattice dynamics is an alternative to
these methods, and can be performed with more accurate
force elds (26, 27), and at a moderate computational cost. Lattice dynamics studies of clathrates are rare, but Dang
and Pettitt (28) and Belosludov et al.
