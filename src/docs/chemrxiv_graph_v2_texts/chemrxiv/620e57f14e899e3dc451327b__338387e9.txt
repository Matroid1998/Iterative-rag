Description:
A compound used in reactions with organolithium gels achieving high conversions.

Text:
. One of the key design principles of our organolithium gels is that they have an even distribution of the 
reagent through the gel which is distinct to the drill and fill capsule technology originally reported by 
Buchwald and coworkers (Fig. 1A).12 To prove the equal distribution of reagent through the 
organolithium gels, a PhLigel block was cut into three equivalent pieces using a razor blade. Each of 
these pieces was used in a separate reaction with 2methoxyacetophenone 1 to give 2 in conversions 
of 96, 97 and 98 (Fig. 3B), clearly demonstrating that it will be possible to subdivide the 
organolithium gel blocks to facilitate accurate dosing of the organolithium reagent into the desired 
reaction.

Involved in reactions with organolithium gels yielding good conversions.

In terms of application of the technology, this is crucial as it demonstrates that a single large 
batch of an organolithium gel could be produced inhouse (or by a chemical supply company), 
packaged and stored (and shipped) in an appropriate way, and then subdivided into the precise 
amounts required by the enduser and used in multiple different reactions. The PhLigel and BuLigel blocks also performed very well in other nucleophilic addition reactions. For 
these reactions, the organolithium gels were prepared and then stored for 1030 s before use in the 
reactions shown  good conversions to products 3, 5 and 79 (7579) were obtained from reactions 
with 2methoxyacetophenone 1, benzophenone 4 and Nbenzylideneaniline 6 (Fig. 3C).
