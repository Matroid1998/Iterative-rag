Description:
Ligands commonly found in mononuclear Ru(I) complexes.

Text:
Due to the presence of two phosphines in 1P, we speculated that 
this approach may also allow for the synthesis of a hitherto unknown 
Ru(I)  2alkyne complex. In this context, it needs to be noted that all 
the yet known mononuclear Ru(I) complexes actually contain phos
phines,9, 10 but differ in their valence electron counts and in their ge
ometries.

Description:
Two mutually cis-positioned phosphines are part of a Ru(I) complex.

While Peters and others succeeded in isolating trigonal bi
pyramidal 17valencee Ru(I) complexes,9a, c, e Grtzmacher re
ported a unique 15valencee Ru(I) complex in a square planar co
ordination environment.9d The latter 15valencee Ru(I) complex 
(D) comprises two coordinated olefins and two mutually cisposi
tioned phosphines, while an  6arene interaction (between the metal 
and one of the arenes in tropPPh2, see Figure 1) was found in the 
corresponding Ru(II) counterpart (C).9d Given that these stereo
chemical peculiarities interfere with an unambiguous comparison of 
C and D, our strategy to employ a rigid tridentate scaffold (such as 
1P) for the synthesis of mutually comparable Ru(I), Ru(II) and
