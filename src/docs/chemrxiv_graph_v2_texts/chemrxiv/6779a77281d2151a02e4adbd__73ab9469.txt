Description:
Clusters that can be synthesized by chemical reduction by CO in alkaline alcoholic solution.

Text:
The synthesis of platinum carbonyl clusters of a Pt3(CO)6n2 formula, known as Chini clusters, 
was proposed in the 1960s 1. They can be synthesized by chemical reduction by CO in alkaline 
alcoholic solution. They can also be synthesized by radiolysis in alcohol solution under CO 
atmosphere, the nucleation n can be tuned by the irradiation dose 2, 3. They consist of multiple 
stacking units of Pt3 triangles stabilized by CO ligands bound in two diferent ways terminal 
(connected to one Pt atom) and bridging (connected to two Pt atoms)  see Figure 1. Their 
physicochemical properties and their optical properties depend on the nuclearity number n. 
Their redox properties have been studied by pulse radiolysis 3.
