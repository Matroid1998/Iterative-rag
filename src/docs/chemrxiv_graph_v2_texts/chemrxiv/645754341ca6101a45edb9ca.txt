Description:
A component of a polymeric ionic liquid composite used in electrolysis without additional supporting electrolyte.

Text:
Furthermore, using a large amount of electrolyte can 
increase the mass transfer of reactive species to the electrodes, improving the efficiency of the 
reaction. However, to overcome these limitations, new strategies are being developed, for example 
Little and coworkers have developed a polymeric ionic liquidSuper P carbon black composite 
6. The system allows electrolysis to be performed without adding an additional supporting 
electrolyte, with efficient recovery and reuse.
