Description:
Anthropogenic molecules that accumulate in living organisms due to their hydrophobicity and are toxic to wildlife and humans.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme persistent organic pollutants (POPs) 
 despite being known for decades  are an increasing threat to humankind.1 They include 
anthropogenic molecules that, once entered, remain in the environment for a long time and get 
distributed around the world. Due to their hydrophobicity they accumulate in living organisms 
while being toxic not only to wildlife but also to us humans.2,3 For this reason the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants or short just Stockholm Convention hosted by the 
United Nations was put into action in 2004 as an international measure against POPs.4 Among 
the twelve initial pollutants of concern are the socalled polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
