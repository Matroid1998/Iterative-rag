Description:
Used in electrografting for surface modification, requiring an applied reducing potential.

Text:
Two major factors limit the 
applicability of aryl diazonium electrografting for surface 
modification; the need to use an applied reducing potential, and 
the highly acidic and oxidizing conditions used in preparing 
diazonium salts from anilines. Diazonium electrografting is thus 
generally limited to electrically conductive substrates and 
aromatic 
substrates 
with 
inert 
substituents. Although 
spontaneous grafting through thermal homolysis or photolysis 
of aryl diazonium salts over a long period of time is also 
known,6,7 the process is slower and some studies find that the 
films formed are not as durable as electrografted films.
