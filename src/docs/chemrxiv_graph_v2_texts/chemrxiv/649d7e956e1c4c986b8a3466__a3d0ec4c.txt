Description:
Used in the interaction with activated derivatives of N-protected amino acids for AADDK preparation.

Text:
Despite the existing alternative approaches to 
preparation of AADDKs emerged in the literature, 1,2,13 inter
action of activated derivatives of Nprotected amino acids 
with diazomethane still remains the most efficient 
method.14 However, high toxicity and explosiveness of 
CH2N2 strongly limit both availability and utility of the 
AADDKs even in mediumscale laboratory syntheses.

Description:
Has an enthalpy of decomposition of approximately 5450 kJ/kg, comparable to modern explosives.

In 
particular, the enthalpy of decomposition of diazomethane 
amounts to ca 5450 kJkg15 and is comparable with mod
ern explosives (RDX 6125 kJkg).16 Previously, the CH2N2 
based transformations both in laboratory and industry 
were performed via the safer trimethylsilylderivative 
Me3SiCHN2, but in 2011, after the 2008s lethal case, the use 
of this reagent was also significantly limited.17 In recent 
years, CH2N2 and other nonstabilized diazo compounds, are 
experiencing a renaissance due to achievements in flow 
technology.18 In fact, the discovery of HIV protease inhibi
tors 
nelfinavir, 
amprenavir, 
atazanavir, 
palinanavir, 
saquinavir and darunavir has given an impulse to adapta
tion of the diazomethanebased syntheses to industrial rou
tines, as chiral aminoalcohol moieties in their structure can 
be introduced via AADDK derivatives (Figure 1, B and C).19 
In addition, a similar chiral fragment has been used recently 
in the design of 3CL protease inhibitor of SARS CoV2.20 
The first attempts of industrial AADDK synthesis have 
been made by Phoenix Chemicals Ltd in 2002.21 A pilot 
semiflow reactor for the CH2N2 generation from Diazald 
(NmethylN(ptolylsulfonyl)nitrosamide) has been devel
oped with the purpose to avoid the worstcase scenario the 
explosion of diazomethane.

Description:
Provided as a water solution suitable for water-tolerant reactions.

Text:
The productivity of the system 
has reached up to 90 g of CH2N2 per hour (2.1 molh). In 
2008, Chemtec Leuna also proposed a microreactor based 
on the generation of CH2N2 from Diazald.22 Corning Inc. has 
designed a reactor with the productivity up to 0.8 molh us
ing NmethylNnitrosourea (MNU) as CH2N2 source.23 An
other low productivity (0.1 molh ) flow reactor for diazo
methane preparation from MNU has been presented in 
2016.24 However, all the above setups have provided a wa
ter solution of diazomethane (a wet technology), suitable 
only for watertolerant reactions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023926vf ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000342818268 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
