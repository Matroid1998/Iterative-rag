Description:
An argyrodite family compound with isotropic ionic transport influenced by crystallographic S2X disorder affecting lithium distribution.

In 
Li10(GeSn)P2S12, the diffusion of Li is dominated by channels for fast Li conduction.57 In the 
argyrodite family Li6(PSb)S5X, ionic transport is isotropic and strongly influenced by a 
crystallographic S2X disorder that affects the lithium distribution.8 Nevertheless, the fastionic 

transport and large structural differences make these materials ideal for investigating fundamental 
questions in solid ionic conductors. In particular, they provide the opportunity to identify trends 
that are independent of the crystallographic structure.
