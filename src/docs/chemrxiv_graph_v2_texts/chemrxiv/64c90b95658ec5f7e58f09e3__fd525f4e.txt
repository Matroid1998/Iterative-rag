However, clear guideline values for sulfate in 
96 
water have not been fully administered yet (WHO, 2004), see also (Boone et al., 2012). 97 
Excess amount of SO42 may concur with abundant Cu2 and thus aggravate the burdens 
98 
of pollution on the environment due to various natural and anthropogenic processes 
99 
(Tabatabai, 1987), such as the widespread use of copper sulfate CuSO4 in fertilisers and
