Description:
Subject to catalytic strategies for deoxygenative transformations.

Text:
Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and phosphines is an 
efficient strategy in a single electron manifold.1822 While stoichiometric derivatization of the hydroxyl 
group has resulted in selective protocols for various transformations, the strategy is not ideal when 
considering atom and step economy. To tackle this, catalytic strategies for deoxygenative 
transformations of nonderivatized alcohols is an area of considerable synthetic interest that 
encompasses, e.g., dehydrogenative transition metal catalysis,2326 catalytic Mitsunobu protocols,27,28 
carbocationic routes,2933 TsujiTrost type activation34 and radical transition metal catalysis (Figure 1,
