Description:
A binder that can adversely affect recycling efficiency by depositing on the surface of cathode active material particles.

These techniques offer 
critical insights into the physicochemical properties of valuables 
in BM and allow for investigating the effects of pretreatment 
and recycling processes, thereby providing a datadriven 
framework to design and optimize efficient recycling strategies. Pretreatment of BM is crucial due to the presence of impurities 
such as residual electrolytes, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 
binder, carbon black, and other organic species deposited on 
the surface of cathode active material (CAM) and graphite.7 
Removal of PVDF binder is highly desirable as it can adversely 
affect recycling efficiency by depositing on the surface of CAM 
particles. Mechanical pretreatment methods such as ball 
milling are used to liberate the CAM and graphite particles,
