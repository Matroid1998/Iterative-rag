Description:
Participates in the nitrogen reduction reaction as analyzed by RRDE.

Text:
The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) is a powerful electrochemical tool for the 
mechanistic analysis of electrochemical reactions at electrode surfaces.1,2 This is due to the 
ability of the RRDE to detect the products of an electron transfer reaction occurring at the inner 
disk electrode via the outer ring electrode.2 In this way RRDEs can be employed to identify 
different mechanistic pathways in an electron transfer process.3 RRDEs in particular have found 
use as a method for assessing electrocatalyst activity for processes such as the oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR),46 the nitrogen reduction reaction,7 and carbon dioxide reduction.8 The RRDE 
ring electrode can also be used as a pH sensor to detect pH changes resulting from reactions on 
the disk.9,10 
In a RRDE, the ring and disk electrodes can be made from the same, or different, 
electrode materials, dependent on the electron transfer process to be studied.
