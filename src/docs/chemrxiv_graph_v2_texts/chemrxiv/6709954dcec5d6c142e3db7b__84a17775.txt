Description:
Atoms whose configurations in a lattice can be rapidly explored using Bayesian optimization to affect phonon transport.

At present, determination of the stable atomistic configurations of doped atoms 
and protons is a difficult and timeconsuming task since the initial configurations of the doping 
atoms and protons can change depending on the size of the simulation cell and the number of 
doped atoms. In addition, relaxation calculations using the density functional theory (DFT) 
approach are required for each initial configuration, thereby rendering it impossible to perform 
relaxation calculations for all possible initial configurations and to find stable structures using such 
approaches. Using machine learning to optimize atomistic configurations, Ju et al.11 demonstrated that the 
configurations of silicon and germanium atoms in a lattice could be rapidly explored by means of 
Bayesian optimization to maximize or minimize phonon transport.
