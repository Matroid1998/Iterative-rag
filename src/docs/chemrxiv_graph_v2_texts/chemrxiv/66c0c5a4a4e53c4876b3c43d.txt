Climate change is, arguably, one of the most pressing issues facing society.1 Many 
emerging technologies aimed at mitigating climate change, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, 
LED lights, and batteries,2 rely on rare earth elements, including yttrium, scandium, and the 14 
lanthanide (Ln) elements. However, extracting and separating these rare earth elements from ores,3 
recycled electronics,4 or spent nuclear fuel5 is challenging and costly due to their similar physical 
and chemical properties.
