Description:
A feedstock used in reforming reactions for dehydrogenation processes.

Liquid organic hydrogen carrier technology is central to the transoceanic shipment of 
hydrogen1,2. Discovering costeffective catalysts that selectively dehydrogenate the 
hydrogen carriers while minimizing sidereactions is essential for the widespread 
deployment of this technology. Currently, these catalysts are discovered using trial
anderror methods that modify existing catalysts that were developed for other 
dehydrogenation reactions like naphtha reforming and light alkane dehydrogenation3. First principles calculations and more recently, machine learning methods have 
introduced accelerated paradigms for catalyst discovery4,5,6,7. It is inevitable that such 
computational methods will be essential in discovering catalysts for dehydrogenating 
hydrogen carriers that need to meet stringent stability and selectivity requirements.
