Description:
Bioactive compounds synthesized by CDPS enzymes.

Text:
Here, we focus on the only two known CDPS enzymes which synthesise bioactive 
histidinecontaining cyclic dipeptides (Scheme 1). 1115 Cyclo(HisPhe) (cHF) 
encompasses the backbone structure of the antitumour compound plinabulin, while 
cyclo(HisPro) (cHP) is endogenous to the human body and proposed as a neuroprotective 
peptide against Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,16,17 as well as a
