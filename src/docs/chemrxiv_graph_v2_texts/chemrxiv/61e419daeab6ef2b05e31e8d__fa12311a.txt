Description:
Crystallized in monoclinic structure without lattice symmetry centre, yielding a strong internal electric field (IEF).

As shown in Scheme 1, when 
the lattice symmetry was broken deliberately, the elimination of symmetric centre would 
introduce nonoverlap positive and negative charge centres, creating dipole moments in 
the lattice. Therefore, a remarkable IEF would be built up along the dipole direction 
throughout the whole bulk.12 In this work, we verified the feasibility of the hypothesis above 
by demonstrating that PDAMAH, which had crystallized in monoclinic structure without 
lattice symmetry centre, yielded a much stronger IEF than the orthorhombic PDAPAH and 
the amorphous MDAMAH. The robust IEF of PDAMAH greatly accelerated the CST 
process, leading to a rapid visiblelightdriven water disinfection with 7 logs (99.9999) 
inactivation of E. coli within 1 h, which is the highest among those with previously reported 
polymeric photocatalysts.
