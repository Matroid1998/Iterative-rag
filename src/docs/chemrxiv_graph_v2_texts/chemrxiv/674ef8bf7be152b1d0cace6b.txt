Text:
The noble gas Helium (He) is the smallest gas (kinetic diameter dkin(He)  2.60 ) and is a rare resource, 
making efficient production important. He is holding significant value for the future of the energy sector 
and for advancement of different high tech sectors, such as medicine and research.1 Natural gas 
(methane, CH4, dkin  3.8 ) as one of the primary fossil energy source can contain up to 4  He, but 
usually lower concentrations are observed.
