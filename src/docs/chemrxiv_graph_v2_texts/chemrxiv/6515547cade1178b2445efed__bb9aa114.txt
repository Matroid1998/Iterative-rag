permeability of industrystandard fluorocarbon membranes such as Nafion 115, leading to 
high methanol crossover, and (ii) the need for a more efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction. The loss of fuel cell performance due to slow O2 reduction kinetics can be minimised to a 
certain extent by reducing the thickness of the membrane to lower its ionic resistance, but this 
also increases methanol crossover. Higher concentrations of methanol fuel can increase power 
density and reduce fuel volume, but in general a high concentration of methanol in the aqueous 
feed leads to excessive swelling of the membrane. Furthermore, unoxidised methanol 
concentrates at the anode and will again cross over to the cathode.
