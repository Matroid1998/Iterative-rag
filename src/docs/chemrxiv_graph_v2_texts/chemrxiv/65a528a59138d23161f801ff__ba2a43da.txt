Description:
Contain a 7,8-dihydroxy structural element that can be converted to aldehyde groups.

Text:
Mild periodate treatment was used to convert the 7,8dihydroxy structural element in sialic 
acids to aldehyde groups6, which react in a second step in hydrazone or oximeforming reactions.5, 7 
However, published labelling protocols involve a total of 0.52 h incubation of cells at 04C, and wash 
steps to remove excess labelling reagents prior to fluorescence microscopic imaging. This can induce cold 
stress potentially altering cellular surfaces. Herein we describe faster and milder reactions which can be 
performed at ambient or physiological temperature. In order to minimize the number of washing steps, we considered fluorogenic probes, which fluoresce 
more strongly when binding to the cell surface sialic acids than freely in solution.

Description:
Attached to cell surfaces through acylhydrazone ligation.

Text:
We show that the dyes, when rendered cell 
impermeable by attachment to triaspartate peptides and attached to cell surface sialic acids through 
acylhydrazone ligation, enable rapid fluorescence microscopic imaging of the cell surface. Of note, this 
property is common also to thiazole orange (TO) previously not considered as a cell surface stain. TO is 
virtually nonfluorescent in free form but experiences dramatic fluorescence enhancements upon DNA 
intercalation because rotations around a central methine bridge are hindered.1315 TO dyes are therefore 
frequently used as nucleic stains.16 In addition, TO has been used to sense the vicinity of proteins that 
hinder twisting.17 Assuming that glycan labelling and cell surface viscosity would induce a similar effect, 
we repurposed TO to enable staining of the cell surface.
