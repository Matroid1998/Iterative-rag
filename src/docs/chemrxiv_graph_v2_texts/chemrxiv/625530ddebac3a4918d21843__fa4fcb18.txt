Description:
Used as premedication to reduce hypersensitivity reactions.

Text:
Even with the pre
medication including corticosteroids and antihistamines, CrEL induced hypersensitivity 
reactions are commonly observed 4 and most vehiclesexcipients do not allow for 
solubilization of more than 20 wt. 25 wt. and the overall increase in apparent solubility is 
limited. Thus, for the delivery of these agents, there is clear need to find alternative 
formulations and vehicles. Polymeric micelles (PMs) have long been investigated as a promising drug delivery platform. They are nanoscopic architectures formed by the selfassembly of amphiphilic polymers 5, 
6. During (or after) the selfassembly process, PMs are capable to encapsulatesolubilize 
additional hydrophobic molecules. Several PMs formulations are already in clinical use or 
have been in clinical trials, for example NK911 and GenexolPM 710.
