Description:
One of the most used transition metals in catalysis.

Text:
Excited state reactivity in metal 
complexes has emerged as a broadly useful concept in synthetic 
chemistry.2, 21 As a corollary, the discovery of previously 
unknown excited state reactivity, particularly with complexes 
with established utility in catalysis, holds the potential to enable 
novel and interesting transformations. In this regard, palladium 
is one of the most used transition metals in catalysis yet the 
large majority of processes developed using Pd catalysts 
operate under ground state conditions. Transformations that 
take advantage of photoexcited states during Pd catalysis 
remain relatively underexplored. The interaction of visible light with Pd(0) complexes has recently 
been advanced by the groups of Gevorgyan, Fu, Ryu and others 
as a method for oneelectron reduction of organic halides that
