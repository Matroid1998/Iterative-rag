Description:
A system where the zero point energy strengthens the bond between halide ions.

Text:
XHX systems which share a hydrogen atom between two identical
units X have been studied extensively due to their model character
for the anharmonic quantum dynamics of the lightest nucleus and
their vibrational bond contributions.1 Often, they carry a nega
tive overall charge and can be viewed as proton transfer sytems
XHX
XHX. For the wellcharacterised bihalide anions,
the proton actually prefers a midway position between the two
halide ions and for XCl, the zero point energy strengthens the
bond, instead of weakening it.2 When X is an organic residue, one
can subtly tune the symmetry and conformation of the resulting
anionic complexes.
