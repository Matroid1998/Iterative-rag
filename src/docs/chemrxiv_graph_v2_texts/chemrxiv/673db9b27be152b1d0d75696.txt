Description:
Used as a catalyst in olefin polymerization.

Text:
The structure and properties of methylaluminoxane (MAO)1 
continue to attract interest in the context of olefin polymerization 
using metallocene or other singlesite catalysts. 2  Recent 
attention has been focused on the synthesis and structure of 
modified MAO and solid MAO, which are typically prepared using 
nonhydrolytic methods.3 
The identity of the reactive components of hydrolytic MAO, 
prepared via the controlled hydrolysis of Me3Al,1c,4  remained 
largely unknown.
