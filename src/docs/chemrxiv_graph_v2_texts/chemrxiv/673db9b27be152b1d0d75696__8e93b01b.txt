Description:
Incorporates into reactive sites along the edges of two-dimensional sheets.

Text:
This mystery, however, was partly solved by the 
recent isolation and characterization of a reactive sheet structure, 
(MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (hereinafter 26,9), by Luo et al.5 
Theory suggests the bulk of hydrolytic MAO contains relatively 
unreactive large cages, or other structures, with tetrahedral 
O3AlMe and trigonal O groups in sixmembered or larger 
(MeAlO)n rings.6 Reactive structures consist of strained cages,7 
especially those with vicinal (MeAlO)2 rings,8 extended cages9 
or nanotubes10 with reactive groups formed via the addition of 
structural Me3Al to the vertices and ends of these structures, and 
twodimensional sheets11 analogous to 26,9 with reactive sites 
incorporating structural Me3Al along their edges.

Description:
Undergoes hydrolysis in polar solvent to form reactive MAO species.

Text:
Fairly recently, reactive MAO species were detected during the 
hydrolysis of Me3Al in polar solvent using the technique of ESI
MS. 12  This sensitive analytical technique relies on ionpair 
formation between reactive MAO species and a Lewis base donor 
such as (Me3SiO)2SiMe2 (OMTS). In sufficiently low amounts, 
OMTS reacts reversibly with MAO according to Scheme 1.9c,13
