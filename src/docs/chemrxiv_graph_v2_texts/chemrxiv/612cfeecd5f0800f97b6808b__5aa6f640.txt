Description:
An ABAtype block copolymer amphiphile that forms long interconnected wormlike aggregates at 5 C, transforming into small spherical polymer micelles upon heating.

was 
described, which formed spheres (4 C, weakly turbid free flowing fluid), worms (22 C, turbid free 
standing gel) or vesicles (50 C, milkywhite free flowing dispersion) in aqueous solution.11 
Very recently, we described a cooling induced and reversible spheretoworm and concurrent solgel 
transition in aqueous solution (Figure 1).12 A ABAtype block copolymer amphiphile poly(2methyl2
oxazoline)bpoly(2phenyl2oxazine)bpoly(2methyl2oxazoline) (pMeOxbpPheOzibpMeOxA
pPheOziA) featuring the novel aromatic PheOzi repeat unit. At 5 C, the polymer exhibited long 
interconnected wormlike aggregates, which transformed into small, uniform and spherical polymer 
micelles upon heating. The temperature, at which the system liquified and its viscosity decreased
