Description:
Parameters for bromine were developed using the band structures of real and fictitious homoelemental crystal structures as reference data, making them suitable for predicting electronic properties of materials.

This work was subsequently
extended to provide full parameterizations (including repulsive potentials) of all elements Z20 and
Bromine.29 Very recently, complementary spinorbit coupling parameters were also reported.30 In
contrast to the GFN models, these parameters follow the original DFTB formulation and were fitted
using the band structures of real and fictitious homoelemental crystal structures as reference data. They are thus extremely well suited for predicting the electronic properties of materials (e.g. in
