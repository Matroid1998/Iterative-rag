Description:
Thermodynamically highly stable, requiring significant energy to break its chemical bonds.

To limit global warming to 1.52  above preindustrial levels, worldwide countries have 
pledged to cut the CO2 emissions to nearly zero (or net zero) by the mid of 21st century.1 Net 
zero requires a complete upgrading for the current energy system, since approx. 75 of GHG 
emissions result from todays energy sector.2 Fossil fuels are essential to supply approx. 80 
of todays worldwide energy demand, and they are projected to play an indispensable role in 
an immediate timeframe.2 Carbon capture is reported as both an effective and scalable 
technology to decarbonize the fossil fuelsbased energy sectors.3 Further conversion of 
captured CO2 to highvalue products (or utilization) requires an excessive amount of energy 
to break its chemical bonds, because CO2 is thermodynamically highly stable.
