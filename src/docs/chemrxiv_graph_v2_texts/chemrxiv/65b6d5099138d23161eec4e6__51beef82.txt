Description:
A quinoline alkaloid isolated from Waltheria indica.

Text:
While significant progress has been made in the development of new drugs against other 
trypanosomatidic diseases, this is not the case for Chagas disease, where a preclinical pipeline 
is virtually absent and clinical studies are currently performed only with drugs approvedin 
development for other indications.5,6 
Among compounds that have been reported to inhibit intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes in vitro 
with high potency and selectivity6 are a number of quinoline alkaloids that were isolated from the 
roots of Waltheria indica.7,8 This includes, for example, waltheriones F (1), M (2), G (3), Q (4), H 
(5), and J (6) (Figure 1), which exhibit IC50 values against T. cruzi of 0.02  1.1 M; 1, 3, and 4 
show selectivity ratios vs. noninfected L6 rat skeletal muscle myoblasts cells of 10.7
