Description:
Used by enzymes in the production of complex sugars during photosynthesis.

Carbon oxides, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), offer an intriguing 
potential to build carboncarbon bonds directly with high atom efficiency. The ideology is 
inspired by nature, where enzymes are known to use CO2 and H2O in the production of 
complex sugars during photosynthesis. Some have suggested that even under prebiotic 
conditions that CO may be one of natures building blocks for sugars.1,2 These C1 building 
blocks are commonly discussed in terms of their toxicity or negative impact as greenhouse 
gases; their industrial value can be underappreciated. CO is an abundant, cheap source of carbon and oxygen atoms. It can be readily obtained from 
fossil fuel sources including coal and natural gas.
