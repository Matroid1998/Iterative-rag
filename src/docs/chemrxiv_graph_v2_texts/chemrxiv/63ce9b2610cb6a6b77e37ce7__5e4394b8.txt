Description:
Used at a concentration of 5mM to generate diphosphorylated RNA with nsp12.

Text:
The generation of 5ppRNA from 
chemically synthesized 5pppRNA has previously been described, involving incubation of the 
5pppRNA with vaccinia virus capping enzyme in the absence of GTP and Sadenosyl 
methionine.5 Recently, nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of the factors responsible for RNA 
synthesis in SARSCoV2, was used to generate diphosphorylated RNA in the presence of 5mM 
MgCl2 with a similar efficiency as vaccinia virus capping enzyme.6 The procedure described herein 
allows for removal of this intermediate step, enabling direct chemical synthesis of 5ppRNA. This

protocol was adapted from methods published by Zlatev, et al. and optimized for the MerMade 12 
RNADNA synthesizer (BioAutomation).7,8
