due to different number of undercoordinated atoms depending on the shape of Pt nanoparticles6 or quantum 
confinement effects in heterostructures.7 Another notable example for shapedependent properties are calcium
alginate hydrogels containing polylactide nanoparticles. Here the shape of the nanoparticles has a significant 
impact on the final adhesive and mechanical properties of the composite material.8 
For functional materials, nanosized particles are often necessary for an implementation of the material into devices. With regard to application, spin crossover (SCO) complexes are a highly promising family of functional materials 
because of their unique switching properties by different external stimuli (e.g. temperature, pressure or light 
irradiation) between a highspin (HS) and a lowspin (LS) state.9 Switching between these two states changes
