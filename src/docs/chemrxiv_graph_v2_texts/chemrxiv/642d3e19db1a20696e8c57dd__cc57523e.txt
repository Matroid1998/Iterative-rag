Description:
Used in the development of stimuliresponsive supramolecular polymers and hydrogels with self-healing and shape memory properties.

Text:
The development of the stimuliresponsive supramolecular polymers based on cyclodextrins, 
cucurbitnurils and calixarenes in aqueous solution and their functionality (via hostguest 
hydrophobic effects, iondipole interaction or electrostatic interactions) lead to the development 
of new smart materials and biocompatible functional materials 1, 2. It is worth noting that 
cyclodextrin and cucurbitnuril based supramolecular polymer hydrogels as soft and responsive 
materials could exhibit special properties such as selfhealing and shape memories 3. Even 
supramolecular polymers based on multiple noncovalent interactions or with multiple stimuli
responsiveness were constructed. The responsiveness to external stimuli like photochemistry, pH, 
chemically or electrochemically redox and light is a useful characteristic of supramolecular 
polymers 4, 5.
