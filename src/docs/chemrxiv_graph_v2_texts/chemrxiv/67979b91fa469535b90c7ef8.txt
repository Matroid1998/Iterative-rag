Description:
Captured from fossil fuel combustion using an aqueous amine-based absorption process.

Text:
The most mature technology for large scale CO2 
capture from fossil fuel combustion employs an aqueous aminebased absorption process.38 
Although the process has been deployed at full scale at many sites, this capture technology is 
very costly due to the high energy required to regenerate the sorbent and the cost to replace the 
amine sorbents which degrade over time.49 A leading alternative to liquid aminebased capture 
are adsorption technologies which use solid nanoporous sorbents such as pressurevacuum 
swing adsorption (PVSA) or similar processes.1012 A key aspect in these systems is the 
selection of appropriate porous materials that can achieve low energy consumption within a 
given process configuration while maintaining the requisite CO2 purity and recovery targets 
(i.e.
