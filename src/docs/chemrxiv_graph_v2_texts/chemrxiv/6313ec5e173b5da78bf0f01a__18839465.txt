Description:
Known for its long electron decoherence times in qubits.

Text:
Studies of silicon qubits are developing into a major re
search focus 14, due to their inherent long electron de
coherence times. However, the presence of the additional
valley degree of freedom (VDOF) introduces a higher de
gree of complexity (compared to cases where the VDOF
is absent, e.g., GaAs nanodevices 57) which has not
as yet been satisfactorily deciphered, experimentally or
theoretically. Indeed, a number of publications consider
it as a challenge to be overcome or to do away with (see,
e.g., Refs. 1, 810), whereas a second group of publica
tions (see, e.g., Refs. 1115) considers it as a potential
resource to be further explored. Experimental eorts in
both directions are intensely pursued, but a de nitive
resolution has not been reached as yet.

Description:
Used in nanodevices where strong electron-electron interactions occur due to material parameters and size effects.

Text:
The current state of understanding of the VDOF com
plexity in solidstate qubits is further compounded by
the recent realization that the energy gaps in the rel
evant excitation spectra (with the potential to be in
volved in the operation of the qubit) depend crucially
on Wignermolecule (WM) 6, 1627 formation and the
strong electronelectron interactions that naturally arise

in these silicon nanodevices 14, 2831 (also found in
GaAs 3e hybrid qubits 7, 32, 33), due to an interplay
between materials parameters and size that yields large
values for the Wigner parameter RW  1; see Sec. III A.
