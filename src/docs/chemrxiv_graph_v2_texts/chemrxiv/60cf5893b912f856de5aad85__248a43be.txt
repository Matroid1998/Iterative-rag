Description:
A halogen used in doping that undergoes an anomalous p-n-p transition in carrier type with increasing temperature.

We calculate a hole mobility of 6 cm2Vs, which is in agreement
with the range of experimentallymeasured Hall mobilities (4 
22 cm2Vs).1,28 While m
DOS is higher for ptype BiCuSeO sug
gesting higher thermopower, the combination of lower band ef
fective mass (m
b), corresponding to a higher carrier mobility, and
higher band degeneracy (Nb) predicts a higher TE performance
for ntype BiCuSeO. While previous experimental studies have attempted to synthe
size ntype BiCuSeO,2932 none have been able to successfully
demonstrate stable ntype conductivity. In particular, doping with
halogens (Cl, Br, and I) is found to undergo an anomalous p
np transition in the carrier type with increasing temperature,
