example of this is olivine LiFePO4 (LFP), which is a 1D Li conductor along channels in the 
010 direction.1 Lithium diffusivity at 300 K in pristine LFP is 1012 m2 s1; this 
extraordinarily high value should translate to rapid, longrange conduction in bulk solid 
particles.2,3 However, upon the introduction of just 1 of LiFe antisite defects, the intrinsic 
conductivity drops by two orders of magnitude and 90 of the accessible capacity of an equant 
1 m3 particle is lost.36 Owing to this defect intolerance, LFP particles must be nanosized 
along the baxis to retain good kinetics and site accessibility.3,7,8 The design of not just high
rate but defecttolerant battery materials is an outstanding challenge for the field.
