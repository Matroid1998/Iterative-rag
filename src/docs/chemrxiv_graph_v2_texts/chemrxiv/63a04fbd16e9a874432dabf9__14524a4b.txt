Description:
A halogen element involved in the formation of HNgY molecules through photodissociation.

Text:
They are obtained by codeposition of noble gas with HX precursor molecules
(X  Cl, Br, I, OH etc.). After the deposition, the material is irradiated with ultraviolet
(UV) radiation, leading to photodissociation of the precursor. The subsequent migration of
mobile species induced by annealing reorganises the matrix, and as a result, HNgY molecules
