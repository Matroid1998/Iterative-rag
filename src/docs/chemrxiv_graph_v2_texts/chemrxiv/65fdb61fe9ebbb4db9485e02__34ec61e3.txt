Description:
A higher neutral diamondoid studied for its vibrational, electronic, and optical properties.

Text:
Diamondoids are the carbon cage molecular species which attract attention of re
searchers in various fields such as interstellar chemistry 1, nanotechnology 2, and
medicinal chemistry 3. The basic molecular unit of these is adamantane (Ada,
C10H16) 4. Ada and higher neutral diamondoids (diamantane, triamantane, etc.) as well as derivatives thereof have been extensively studied over decades, in particular
with regard to their vibrational, electronic, and optical properties 515. In astrochemistry, the openshell (radical) cations of diamondoids are of special
interest as they absorb lower energy photons in comparison to their neutral coun
terparts and may potentially be formed in interstellar medium by ionization with
photons andor cosmic rays 16. Thus, several recent studies have targeted the
optical spectra of radical cations of diamondoids 1619.

Description:
A cation whose optical spectrum has been recently reported.

Text:
Specifically, the optical
spectrum of Ada has been obtained by electronic photodissociation (EPD) spec
troscopy by Crandall et al. 17 and heliumtagged electronic spectroscopy by Kappe
et al. 18. In addition, the EPD study by Crandall et al. 17 has provided insight
into photoinduced fragmentation of Ada. The optical spectrum of the diamantane
cation, Dia, has also been recently reported by the same group 19. Besides the cations of pristine diamondoids consisting only of carbon and hy
drogen, cations of nitrogencontaining adamantane derivates have received attention
lately 16, 20. In the context of astrochemistry, the interest stems from recent de
tection of aromatic nitriles in the interstellar medium 2123.
