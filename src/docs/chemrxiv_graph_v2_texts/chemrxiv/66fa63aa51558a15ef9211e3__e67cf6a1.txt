Description:
Involved in radical cycloisomerisation onto the ortho-position, followed by rearomatization.

The arylethylamine motif is prevalent in pharmaceutical molecules due to its distinctive biological 
12 
activity and synthetic versatility (Scheme 1a).1,2 Conventional synthetic approaches include 
13 
reductive amination,3 aminoarylation411 and hydroamination.12 An alternative strategy is radical
14 
mediated hydroarylation which has emerged as a potentially efficient strategy for accessing a variety 
15 
of arylethylamines under mild conditions.13 Markovnikovselective radical hydroarylation may 
16 
occur via catalytic hydrogenatomtransfer from a highvalent, firstrow transition metal (MHAT 
17 
catalysis) either using a dualcatalytic, crosscoupling strategy1416 or via radical cycloisomerisation 
18 
onto the orthoposition of a pendant arene, followed by subsequent rearomatization (Scheme 1b).17
19 
19 In the second case, (hetero)cyclic compounds are formed, precluding this as a strategy for linear 
20 
arylethylamine synthesis.
