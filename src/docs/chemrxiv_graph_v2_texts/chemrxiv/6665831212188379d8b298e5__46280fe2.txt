Description:
Exhibits dynamic Jahn-Teller effect and has a structure close to Oh symmetry.

It is currently recognized that ReF6 and OsF6 show the
dynamic JT effect 4749, and the structures of ReF6,
OsF6, IrF6, and PtF6 are very close to Oh based on
electrondiffraction experiments in the gas phase 5052,
singlecrystal Xray diffractometry 53, and extended X
ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) 54. Even if it
exists, the JT distortion may be smaller than experi
mental errors. In theory, the most sophisticated calcula
tion for the thirdrow transition metal hexafluorides was
carried out at the coupled cluster singles and doubles
with perturbed triples (CCSD(T)) level with the SOC
at the DFT level 33. Their calculated structures agree
with the experiment well, but they compared the aver
aged bond lengths of the D4h structures and experimen
tal structures in Oh symmetry.
