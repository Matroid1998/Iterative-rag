Description:
Alloying with magnesium transforms the crystal structure from hexagonal close-packed to body-centered cubic.

Text:
According to the binary phase diagram of the MgLi system 18, alloying of magnesium 
72 
with lithium improves the ductility of the alloy due to the transformation of the crystal structure 
73 
from a hexagonal closepacked (hcp) with a lithium content of less than 5.7 wt. (phase is a 
74 
solid solution of lithium in magnesium) to bodycentered cubic (bcc) with a Li content of more 
75 
than 11.3 wt. (phase, a solid solution of magnesium in lithium). In turn, magnesium alloys 
76 
containing 5.711.3 wt. of Li have both hcp and bcc crystal structures 16,19,20. Due to the 
77 
simultaneous presence of the  and phases, such magnesium alloys are characterized by 
78 
medium strength and high ductility 21.
