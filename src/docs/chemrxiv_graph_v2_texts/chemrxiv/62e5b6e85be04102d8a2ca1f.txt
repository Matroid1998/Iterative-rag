Description:
Copolymerized with various PCA derivatives.

Text:
4Phenoxyphenyl decyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) and its derivatives are reported as 
antimicrobials which prevent bacterial adhesion to surfaces 1. 2,4Diethoxyphenyl 
ethyl PCA is involved in synthesis of (arylmethylene)cyanothioacetamides in a Michael 
reaction 2. 2,4Dimethoxyphenyl propyl PCA 3, 2,5dimethoxyphenyl isobutyl PCA 
4, 2,4dimethoxyphenyl butyl PCA 5, 2,4dimethoxyphenyl isopropyl PCA 6 were 
synthesized and copolymerized with styrene. (2E)3,4Dimethoxyphenyl tbutyl PCA 
was involved in conjugate addition of perfluoroarenes to ,unsaturated carbonyls 
enabled by an alkoxidehydrosilane system 7 and in preparation of 
acylaminobenzamide derivatives for the treatment of diseases caused by the 
supermultiplication of vascular intimal cells 8. 4Ethoxy3methoxyphenyl butyl 9 
and isopropyl, as well as 4hydroxy3,5dimethylphenyl isopropyl 10, and 4fluoro3
methoxyphenyl isobutyl 11 PCAs were prepared and copolymerized with vinyl 
benzene.

Description:
A compound used in copolymerization with various functionalized derivatives.

Text:
Synthesis and styrene copolymerization was reported for 2,3,4
trimethoxyphenyl isobutyl PCA 12. 2,4,5Trimethoxy functionalized styrene was 
reported as bioactive component of the bark of Duguetia panamensis 13. It also was 
mentioned in study of pachypophyllin and pachypostaudins A and B  three 
bisnorlignans from Pachypodanthium staudtii 14 and in study of antiinflammatory 
and antinociceptive activities of a phenylpropanoidenriched fraction of Duguetia 
furfuracea 15. 3 

In this work we have prepared novel ringsubstituted tertbutyl phenylcyanoacrylates, 
RPhCHC(CN)CO2C(CH3)3, where R is 4phenoxy, 3iodo, 2,4dimethoxy, 3,4
dimethoxy, 4ethoxy3methoxy, 4fluoro3methoxy, 4hydoxy3,5dimethyl, 2,3,4
trimethoxy, 2,4,5trimethoxy, and explored the feasibility of their copolymerization with 
styrene. To the best of our knowledge there have been no reports on either synthesis of 
these compounds, nor their copolymerization with styrene 16.
