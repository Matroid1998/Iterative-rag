Description:
A material studied for its various bonding configurations and deposition methods.

Text:
The material carbon nitride has been a research attraction for quite a long time. Different methodologies 
have been used to deposit carbon nitride films with different bonding configurations. The plasma 
enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) using N2C2H2 precursor gases produce hydrogenated 
amorphous carbon nitride (aCHN) films which we have deposited on Si(100) substrates at 400oC 
substrate temperature for 2 hrs with RF power of 600 W 1. SiCN in the form of nanocomposite thin 
films were deposited on Si(100), glass as well as steel substrates at different conditions by the process of 
magnetron sputtering using a SiC target.

Description:
Analyzed with nitrogen flow rate in Raman spectra.

Text:
A detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of SiCN deposited 
with a temperature variation as well as of carbon nitride with nitrogen flow rate has been published 
previously 1, 2, 3 
A flow rate of 5 sccm was maintained for C2H2 while flow of nitrogen was varied as 5, 15, 30 and 60 sccm. The deposition chamber was pumped down to 105 mbar by turbo molecular pump prior to inletting the 
precursor gases. The chemical composition of the deposited films was done by EDS. The concentration 
of nitrogen in film increased with the increase in nitrogen flow and reached nearly 15 at at a nitrogen 
flow rate of 60 sccm. Increase of nitrogen percentage in the films leads to increase in clustering of sp2 
carbon.
