Description:
A highly unstable compound whose stability can be enhanced by selective encapsulation into metal-organic cages.

The concept and the development of molecular hostguest chemistry has resulted 
in many fascinating and emerging technologies (1). The rules of this branch of 
supramolecular chemistry have been applied to large diversity of materials (2). Much 
work in this field has been inspired by the seminal work of Bayer and Wilchek on the 
avidinbiotin pair that became a general tool in the biological sciences (3). An example is 
the use of the complementarity of DNA strains to assemble metallic nanoparticles in 
larger structures as diagnostic tools by Mirkin (4). Chromophores stability and also that 
of highly unstable compounds such as white phosphorus can be enhanced by selective 
encapsulation into metalorganic cages (5,6).
