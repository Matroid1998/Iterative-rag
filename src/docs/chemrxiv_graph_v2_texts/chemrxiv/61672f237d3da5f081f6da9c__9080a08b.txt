Description:
A 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring adjacent to the pyridine in bislactone limonoid alkaloids.

Text:
The limonoid natural products are a diverse family of terpe
noids characterized by their structurally conserved C17furan 
and various modes of skeletal rearrangements.1,2 A fascinating 
subfamily of these natural products, the limonoid alkaloids, 
are recently isolated from the Chinese mangrove, Xylocarpus 
granatum.3,4 The structural hallmark of the limonoid alkaloids 
is the tetrasubstituted pyridine embedded in the core structure 
(Scheme 1), as typified by xylogranatopyridine B (11) and 
granatumine A (12). Furthermore, granatumine A (12) is a 
member of the bislactone limonoid alkaloids, in which the A
ring has undergone further modification to form a 5mem
bered lactone ring fused to the 6membered ring adjacent to 
the pyridine.
