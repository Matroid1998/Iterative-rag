Description:
Used in sharp edges for acoustically exciting microstructures via an external piezoelectric transducer.

The controlled particle manipulation using acoustic forces, acoustophoresis, has been
widely applied due to its advantages of being labelfree, contactless, and exible in design
while exposing biocompatible behaviour.4
Recent publications have illustrated a large variety of microstructures suitable for the
controlled manipulation of single cells and particles through acoustic forces. Solid features
such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or silicon sharpedges are acoustically excited via an
external piezoelectric transducer, leading to the formation of acoustic streaming patterns
in the nearby liquid.58 Unfortunately, the majority of these acoustouidic setups require a
