Description:
Forms a complex with CaM that activates AC1 to produce cAMP.

Processes such as memory acquisition, drug tolerance and dependence, and chronic pain 
are known to be impacted significantly by ACs.7,8 Although ACs are expressed ubiquitously 
throughout the body, certain isoforms have distinct tissue expression patterns.9 AC1 and AC8 are 
primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) within regions such as, but not limited 
to, the hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); regions of the brain associated with 
learning, memory and the development of chronic pain.912 Evidence suggests AC1 is responsible 
for propagation of inflammatory pain stimuli.13 In vivo studies indicate that injury leads to 
increased postsynaptic Ca2 influx in the ACC, where Ca2 forms a complex with CaM that, in 
turn, binds and subsequently activates AC1 to produce cAMP.14,15 In chronic pain, it is suggested
