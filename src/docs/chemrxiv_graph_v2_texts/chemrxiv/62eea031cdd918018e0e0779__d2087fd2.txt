Description:
Strongly interferes with the response of a chemoresistive SiWO3 sensor to acetone.

Text:
Variance
in the concentration of an interferent, if uncorrelated with that of the analyte, breaksweak
enscorruptsconfounds the correlation between the response of the crosssensitive sensor with
the concentration of the analyte. For example, isoprene strongly interferes with the response of
a chemoresistive SiWO3 sensor to acetone 20, making it impossible to use such a sensor to
distinguish between increases in acetone vs. isoprene in human breath 21.
