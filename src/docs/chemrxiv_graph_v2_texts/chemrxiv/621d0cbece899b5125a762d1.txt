Text:
ZnO is a IIVI ntype direct wide band gap semiconductor with and gap of 3.37 eV and large 
exciton binding energy of 60 meV at room temperature13. Such combination of physical properties 
makes ZnO an attractive material for various electronic applications such as ultraviolet light
emitting diodes and laser diodes with low thresholds45. These semiconductor devices demand a 
stable pn homojunction, which consequently requires creation of ptype conductivity in ZnO. email address for correspondence anbinorg.chem.msu.ru
