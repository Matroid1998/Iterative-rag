Description:
Functionalized moieties strongly bound to the backbone of MOF808 structures.

Text:
Along these lines, we focus on MOFs and report a series of eleven 
amino acid functionalized MOF808 structures (MOF808AA), in 
which the amino acid moieties are strongly bound to the backbone. We find that this construct creates an environment inside the pores 
where CO2 uptake under humid conditions leads to the formation of 
bicarbonates, and therefore requiring no application of heat to re
generate the material. In this way, application of rough vacuum is 
sufficient to remove the CO2 and obviate the need for heating cus
tomarily used in aqueous amines and even some solid sorbents. We and others have appended amines as coordinatively or cova
lently bound functionalities into MOFs.20,21,3136 Specifically, MOF
74 has been used in obtaining high capacity for CO2 uptake.
