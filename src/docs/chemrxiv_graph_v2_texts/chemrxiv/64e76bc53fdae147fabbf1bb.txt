Description:
Elements with unique physicochemical properties, where the valence 4f orbitals are corelike due to poor shielding, resulting in predominantly ionic chemical bonding.

Text:
Lanthanides (Lns) have numerous applications due 
to their unique physicochemical properties.1 The text
book description of the electronic structure of Ln ions 
in the dominant 3 oxidation state is that due to poor 
shielding the valence 4f orbitals are corelike, and as 
a result chemical bonding involving Ln ions is 
predominantly ionic.
