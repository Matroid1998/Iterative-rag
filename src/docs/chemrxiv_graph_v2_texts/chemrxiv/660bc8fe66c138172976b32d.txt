Description:
Magnetic nanoparticles used in MOF5 crystals for dynamic localization.

Text:
An early example demonstrated the use of an 
external magnet for the userdirected dynamic localization of 
MOF5 crystals encapsulating magnetic cobalt nanoparticles, 
where the crystals could be easily repositioned at will and used to 
seed further MOF crystallization at userdefined locations.17 
Another example by Hod et al. showed the electrophoretic 
deposition of electrochemically active NU1000 onto the 
patterned exposed surfaces of an oppositelycharged FTO 
electrode, although an improvement in MOF performance through 
patterning was not reported.18 Further, for many applications 
utilizing conductive MOFs, methods to deposit MOFs in 
interelectrode gaps rather than on just one electrode are required.
