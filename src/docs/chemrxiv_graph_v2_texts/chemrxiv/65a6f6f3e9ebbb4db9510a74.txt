Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding which can be altered by point mutations affecting electrostatic environments.

Text:
Additionally, the kinetic pKa values reflected in a pHrate profile are 
often distorted from the intrinsic, or thermodynamic, pKa values of catalytic residues.68 For 
example, we recently showed that a point mutation to a noncatalytic residue in the protein tyrosine 
phosphatase (PTP) YopH does not significantly affect its maximal turnover number, but broadens 
its pHrate dependency, making the variant a much faster enzyme at low pH than the native 
enzyme.9 A computational analysis showed this catalytic change arose from mutationinduced 
changes in conformational equilibria. Point mutations can also alter the pKa of neighboring 
residues by altering the electrostatic environment, or, by inducing changes in hydrogen bonding
