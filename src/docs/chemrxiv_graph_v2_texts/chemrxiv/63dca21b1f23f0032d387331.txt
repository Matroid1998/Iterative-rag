Description:
A key element in the production of NH3 as a chemical feedstock for fertilizer synthesis.

Text:
The artificial fixation of nitrogen by 
Haber and Bosch had ushered in sustenance of the 
everincreasing population by facilitating production 
of NH3 as a chemical feedstock for fertilizer synthesis 
from aerial N2 1. Although it is hailed as one of the 
greatest discoveries of mankind, over the past few 
decades researchers had invested their efforts to 
unearth 
more 
benign 
routes 
through 
solar, 
electrochemical for N2 conversion to NH3 2 as the 
commercial production of NH3 is associated with 
significant carbon footprint3. The inertness of N2 
poses an unassailable challenge to its fixation 
regardless of the fact that N2 conversion to NH3 is a 
thermodynamically feasible process (Gof (298 K) of 
NH3 (from N2 and H2) is 16.4 kJmol).
