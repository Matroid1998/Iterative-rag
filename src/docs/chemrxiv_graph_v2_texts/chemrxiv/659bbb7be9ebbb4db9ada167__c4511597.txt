Description:
A form of lithium polysulfide with varying n values between 2 and 8, contributing to capacity loss in batteries.

Text:
Just as importantly  the discharge 
products of LSBs include highly soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 2  n  8), which, besides being 
lost during battery cycling operation with a concomitant capacity loss, can diffuse through the porous 
separator and detrimentally react with the lithium anode.1315 This process, known as the shuttle effect, 
results in the loss of active sulfur and leads to rapid capacity fading and poor cycling stability.1416 
Furthermore, the high reactivity of sulfur and the polysulfide intermediates can cause severe electrode 
corrosion, leading to electrode dissolution, and a decrease in the batterys overall capacity and 
lifespan.14,16,17 Moreover, the large volume expansion and contraction of the sulfur cathode during 
charging and discharging cycles can result in electrode pulverization, and a loss of electrical contact 
between the active material and the current collector.14,17,18 To overcome these challenges, various
