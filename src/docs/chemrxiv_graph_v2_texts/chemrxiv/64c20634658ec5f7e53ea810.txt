Description:
A promising energy carrier with high energy density and clean reaction products (H2O).

The excessive use of fossil fuels, rapidly increasing energy demands, and severe 
environmental concerns have stimulated a pressing need to develop energy conversion 
systems that are costeffective, efficient, and environmentally friendly1. Hydrogen, 
with its high energy density (120142 MJkg) and clean reaction products (H2O), is a 
promising energy carrier. It has the potential to not only alleviate current energy 
shortages in a sustainable manner but also to promote environmental restoration and 
economic growth2. As a result, hydrogen is increasingly being recognized as a key 
component of future energy systems. However, there is no abundant and pure source of 
hydrogen on Earth. Therefore, it is necessary to generate hydrogen from alternative 
sources, such as natural gas, coal, oil, water, and biomass3. Water electrolysis for hydrogen production offers numerous benefits.
