plasmaborne uremic toxins have on the adsorption and activation of plasma proteins that can 
42 
direct the host response to porous matrixes, however, remains woefully understudied. 43 
Synthetic biodegradable polyesters such as polycaprolactone (PCL) based fibers show 
44 
potential for medical applications in tissue regeneration, drug delivery, and artificial vascular 
45 
grafts 9. Although the physical and chemical properties of PCL are wellstudied, there is 
46 
limited research on biomolecular and cell interactions with its surface. Understanding these
