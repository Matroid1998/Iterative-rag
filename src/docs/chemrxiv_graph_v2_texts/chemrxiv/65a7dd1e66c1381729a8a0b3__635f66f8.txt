On the other hand, access to triplet 
states of PIDA is feasible due to the heavyatom effect of iodine and can be 
reached via direct Dextertype energy transfer of longlived triplet excited 
states of the photocatalyst. However, the operating mechanism is debated 
in the literature In a seminal report by Liang et al. on the coppercatalyzed 
Nalkylation, oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst and subsequent 
reduction of PIDA was described as the initial step in the reaction 
mechanism to form a carboxy radical, which rapidly decarboxylates to form 
the active alkyl radical.8 For most substrates, light activation was not 
necessary and thermal coppercatalyzed coupling between Nnucleophiles 
and alkyl fragments was broadly achieved. The proposed photocatalytic 
mechanism was recently investigated by Mane et al.
