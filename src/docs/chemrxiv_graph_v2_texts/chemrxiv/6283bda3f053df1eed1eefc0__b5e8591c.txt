Description:
A type of carbon used as an electrocatalyst support with varying structures and levels of graphitization.

Text:
In electrocatalytic energy conversion applications carbon is also frequently used as the 
nanostructured electrocatalyst support for electrocatalytically active nanoparticles (NPs). The 
carbon, typically a carbon black, can take a variety of structures, which range in the ratio of 
sp2 to sp3 bonded carbon and the level of graphitization.7 Such carbons are used due to their 
low cost, electrical conductivity and reduced electrocatalytic activity towards the energy 
conversion processes of interest.8 To assess NP structure pre and post electrocatalysis, either 
the NPs or the NPs plus carbon black support, can be placed on the carbon TEM grid.9,10 
Outside of energy applications, carbon film TEM grids have also found used in the elucidation 
of electrochemically driven NP deposition mechanisms.11,12
