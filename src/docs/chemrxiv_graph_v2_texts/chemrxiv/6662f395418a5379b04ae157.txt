Description:
A taxane site binder used to treat various types of cancers.

Text:
The first clinically approved class 
of anticancer chemotherapy drugs was vinca alkaloids.7 These agents bind at the interface between 
tubulin dimers, inhibiting microtubule dynamics.8 In addition to vincabinding site, at least five 
other binding pockets have been characterized on tubulins to date5 and more recently several new 
pockets have been identified.9 The two best characterized of these are the taxane site, located on 
the luminal side of the tubulin subunit,10 and the colchicine site, located in the intradimer 
interface of tubulin.11 Taxane site binders, such as paclitaxel and some of its analogues, were 
clinically approved in the 1990s and have been widely and successfully used to treat various types 
of cancers.12 The colchicinebinding site, named after a longknown drug derived from the plant 
Colchicum autumnale, is a very attractive and not yet clinically exploited anticancer target.
