Worldwide growth of industrialization and its impact on global climate, e.g. effect of rising 
2 
emissions, leads more and more to the necessity of suitable, economical and sustainable 
3 
utilization of greenhouse gases 1,2. During the last decades different options for reasonable 
4 
carbon capture, storage and utilization concepts are widely discussed, being chemical 
5 
conversion of CO2 towards chemicals and fuels among the most relevant 36. As a 
6 
consequence, the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) respective methane from 
7 
sustainable resources via the socalled PowertoGas (PtG) process gains increasing 
8 
importance, as methane can easily be distributed and utilized in the existing natural gas grid 
9 
infrastructure 79.

Description:
Formed on Ni based catalysts according to stoichiometric equations.

Text:
The methanation reaction set the basis for similar reactions based on COx 
10 
hydrogenation, which involve the formation of higher hydrocarbons 1012 or alcohols 13,14. 11 
In the overarching concept hydrogenation of CO2 or CO towards methane is performed utilizing 
12 
H2 produced with electrolysis of water. In a broader perspective, the PtG process can be 
13 
extended to the production of various hydrocarbons relevant for the use in the energy sector 
14 
or in the chemical value chain via the more general PowertoX approach 15. Already in 1902 
15 
Sabatier et al. discovered that methane is formed on Ni based catalysts according to the 
16 
stoichiometric eqs. (1) and (2) 16.
