Recently, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) have been 
investigated as electrode materials for energy storage due to 
their unique structural features.13 It is well established that the 
synthetic routes chosen to MOFs are key to controlling their 
morphology, porosity, and crystallinity, which are critical to 
their physicochemical properties.36 Moreover, economic 
applicability and environmental footprint should also be 
considered, especially regarding their largescale synthesis.7 
Traditionally, solvothermal synthesis is the most commonly 
utilized among various synthetic procedures reported to 
prepare MOFs.8 However, these methods usually require large 
amounts of organic solvents and prolonged reaction times  
which sometimes could take a few days to complete the desired 
transformation.9, 10 Inevitably, these factors increase both 
preparation costs and the overall environmental footprint.10 
Ideal synthetic strategies for preparing MOFs should hold 
characteristics such as lowcost, environmentally friendly, and 
readily scalable.6, 7, 10 So far, several synthetic methods other 
than solvothermal synthesis have been reported.1119 Among 
them, mechanochemistry stands out due to its unique ability to 
bypass the issues highlighted above for the synthesis of MOFs, 
energy materials, and molecular solids.2026 Indeed, the 
mechanochemical solventfree synthesis of MOFs has gained 
momentum over the last few years, with many attractive MOFs 
such as ZIF8, MOF74(Zn), and HKUST1 being successfully 
synthesized with this strategy.21, 2731 
In addition, due to their low intrinsic conductivity, MOFs are 
often compositing with other conductive agents32, 33 (e.g., 
reduced graphene oxide,2, 34 carbon nanotubes,35, 36 etc.)
