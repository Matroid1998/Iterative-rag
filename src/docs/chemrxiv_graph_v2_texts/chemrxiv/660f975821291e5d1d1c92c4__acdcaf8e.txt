Description:
A commonly used surfactant molecule.

Text:
However, due to 
computational burden, this type of modelling can be applied only to small systems. Here we choose 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as a timeefficient but still sufficiently accurate method to 
capture atomistic insights. Various studies have investigated interfacial dynamics of commonly used surfactant molecules 
such as sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) via MD 
simulations 1921. Azobenzene based compounds have been modelled with various force fields. A 
polymer consistent forcefield (PCFF) has been employed to capture thermomechanical features 
of azobenzenes22 and to investigate structural changes of azo based monolayers23. OPLS
