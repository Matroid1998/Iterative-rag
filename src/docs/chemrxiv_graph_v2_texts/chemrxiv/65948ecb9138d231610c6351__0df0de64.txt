Description:
A dimer formed via 22 cycloaddition in DNA, leading to lesions upon UV irradiation.

Text:
Exploration on thymine chemistry mainly focused on dimerization forming a cyclobutanepyrimidine 
dimer (CPD)14 and the reverse photolyasecatalyzed dissociation of CPD in the past decades3,4. The 
dimer CPD formation via 22 cycloaddition is a harmful reaction occurring in DNA and it is the most 
abundant DNA lesion upon ultraviolet (UV) irradiation that eventually causes skin cancer2; and this 
dimer formation is also responsible for bacteria inactivation by subsequent inhibiting the DNA 
replication3.
