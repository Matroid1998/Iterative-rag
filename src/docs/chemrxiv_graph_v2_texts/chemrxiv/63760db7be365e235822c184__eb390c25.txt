An important class of sulfur heterocycles used widely in the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials.

Text:
As the sulfur analogous of lactones, sultones are an important class of 
sulfur heterocycles that used widely in the synthesis of natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, biologically active molecules and advanced functional 

materials1. Due to the remarkable synthesis importance, considerable 
efforts have been exerted to develop efficient methods for the synthesis of 
these valuable building blocks. Over the past decade, transitionmetal 
catalyzed CH insertion reactions2, cycloaddition reactions3, radical 
reactions4 and metathesis reactions5 have been developed for the 
construction of sultones. Recently, Lupton6 and Qin7 developed a tandem 
annulation reaction of easily tautomerizable ketones (or their TMS enol 
ethers) and ethenesulfonyl fluorides, which provide a novel protocol for 
the synthesis of sultones.

Functionalized compounds significant in organic synthesis.

Despite these important progress, development 
of efficient and mild method for the construction of different functionalized 
sultones is still highly significant. On the other hand, allyl ketones are another type of synthetically 
valuable reagents that used widely in organic synthesis. Owing to the steric 
effect, these deconjugated carbonyls usually serve as vinylogous 
nucleophiles to undergo aldol reactions or Michael additions at position 
selectively8. In addition, the terminal carboncarbon double bond of allyl 
ketones can also participate in DielsAlder cyclization to form 
heterocycles9. During our research on SuFEx click reactions10, we found 
that allyl ketones do not undergo the anticipated selective Michael 
addition with the active ethenesulfonyl fluoride. Interestingly, an 
unexpected selective Michael additionSuFEx cyclization reaction 
performed to produce alkenylated sultones efficiently. Herein, we
