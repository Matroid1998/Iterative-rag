Description:
NMR silent as it does not have a magnetic moment, used in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP)15 is a well
established tool to enhance weak NMR signals. PHIP makes 
efficient use of the spin order of parahydrogen (pH2, the H2 
molecule in its nuclear singlet spin state) which is converted into 
observable NMR signals. Since pH2 is NMR silent (as it does not 
have a magnetic moment) suitable chemical processes must be 
harnessed to convert the spin order into an enhanced NMR 
signal. Such processes are given by catalytic hydrogenation 
reactions3 with pH2 or by reversible interactions of pH2 with an 
organometallic complex5, 6.
