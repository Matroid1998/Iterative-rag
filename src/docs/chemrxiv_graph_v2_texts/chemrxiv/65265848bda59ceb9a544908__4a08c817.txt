Description:
Involved in storage capacity and oxidation kinetics in RMnO3 materials.

Text:
The two latter examples give a smaller 
tolerance factor due to reduction of a fraction of Mn3 to larger radius Mn2, and the material is easily re
oxidized at lower temperatures after high temperature synthesis. Here we demonstrate stabilization of the hexagonal manganite phase through high entropy compositions of 
RMnO3, with R  Y, GdEr, resulting in materials with excellent oxygen storage capacity and outstanding 
oxidation kinetics. High configurational entropy favors singlephase hexagonal materials with oxygen storage 
capacity comparable to the best reported single R compounds. Importantly, the oxidation kinetics is 
significantly improved, and both the capacity and kinetics are insensitive to the exact rare earth cation
