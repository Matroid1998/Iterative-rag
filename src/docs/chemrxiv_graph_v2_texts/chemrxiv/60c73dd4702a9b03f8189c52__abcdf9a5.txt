Description:
A terminal unit in the monomer based on the electron-rich monomer EDOT.

Formation
of intrinsically conducting polymer lms can also be approached by incorporating sidechain
units that can be converted into a conducting polymer by a second reaction, a technique
pioneered in solution by Swager et al.10 Our monomer is based on Swagers, but with the
terminal thiophene units being based on the extremely electronrich monomer EDOT for
