Description:
Their loss distorts the Al octahedra, causing structural disorder.

Loss of 
hydroxyl groups distorts the Al octahedra, which causes significant structural disorder in the 
octahedral sheet; in turn, this results in distortion of the tetrahedral sheet as Si tetrahedra 
rotate to adapt to the new configuration (Bergaya et al., 1996; White et al., 2010). As a result, 
there is buckling of individual 11 layers, and a subsequent loss of longterm order in all 
crystallographic axes. Hereafter metakaolinite will be used to describe the disordered form 
of kaolinite, and metakaolin will be used to describe a clay which contains metakaolinite 
alongside associated minerals. Because of wellestablished limitations and ambiguities 
around the use of crystallinity to describe clay minerals, the term structural order will be 
used instead (Guggenheim et al., 2002).
