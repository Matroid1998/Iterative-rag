Description:
Atoms involved in the transfer within 7azaindole dimers, generating ionic intermediate species.

For example, Zewail
and coworkers reported the hydrogen atoms of 7azaindole dimers,18 a prototypical system
to the DNA base pair, transfer in a nonconcerted manner generating ionic intermediate
species. On the contrary, Kasha and coworkers26 interpret the transfer of protons to have a
