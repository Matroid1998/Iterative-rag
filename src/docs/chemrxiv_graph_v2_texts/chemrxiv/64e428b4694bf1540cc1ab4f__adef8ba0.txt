Microdroplet chemistry, which takes advantage of the airliquid interfacial effect of tiny droplets,810 has 
become a popular tool in various fields such as analysis,1114 reaction monitoring,1518 organic synthesis,1938 
and biological3943 and environmental44 studies. While many studies have reported accelerated reactions in 
microdroplets, the extraordinary reactivities including threecomponent Mannichtype reactions,21 hydrolysis 
of esters,45 tandem amide formation,46 the synthesis of goldhistidine complexes,33 and bromination of 1,2,3
triazoles34 have realized at the gaswater interface in aqueous microdroplets (pure water or waterorganic 
binary solvents with more than 50 water). However, this extraordinary reactivity remains unexplored at the 
gasorganic interface, which is highly desirable considering a major use of organic solvents. It is undoubtedly 
beneficial to uncovering the inherent mechanisms and further broadening the applicability of the unique 
reactivity of microdroplet chemistry.
