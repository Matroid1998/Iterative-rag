Description:
A complex involved in benchmark interaction energy studies.

Text:
of the L7127 and S12L55,94 test sets. The L7
complexes are depicted in Fig. 14, to which we have added a 132atom buckyballinaring system
(C606CPPA). The latter was taken from a recent study,131 in which several of the complexes
in Fig. 14 are found to be problematic for methods well beyond DFT, aording disagreements
amongst the best ab initio benchmarks. For C606CPPA, guaninecytosine on circumcoronene
(C3GC), and the paralleldisplaced coronene dimer (C2C2PD), benchmark interaction energies
obtained from xednode diusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) calculations disagree with CCSD(T)
CBS results.131 The CCSD(T) calculations were performed using a localorbital approximation, in
this case localized natural orbital (LNO)CCSD(T),296299 and such approximations are not without
