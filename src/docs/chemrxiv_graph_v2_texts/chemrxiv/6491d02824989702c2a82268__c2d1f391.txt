Description:
An electron-deficient atom involved in forming a carbanion intermediate.

Text:
An activated olen reacts with a cysteine via Michael addition (Scheme 1),
which has been extensively studied since the 1960s.1014 Although alternative mecha
nisms have been proposed,15 the ratelimiting step of the reaction is believed to be the
nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated thiolate (either directly or via a base catalyst) on
the electrondecient  carbon, leading to a carbanion intermediate, which protonates to
form the thioether adduct (Scheme 1). Thus, the intrinsic reaction rate of a thiolMichael
addition (for protein targets) is determined by the reactivity of the cysteine thiol and that of
the Michael acceptor.
