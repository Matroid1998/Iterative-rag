Description:
A rare earth metal ion known for its Lewis acidity and oxophilicity.

Rareearth metal ions (Sc, Y, lanthanides) have 
attracted significant attention, mainly due to their 
Lewis acidity and oxophilicity. In particular, 
Sc(OTf)3 has been introduced in recent decades as a 
promising Lewis acid for CH functionalisation and 
CC bond formation reactions.1,2 In the past 20 years, 
scandium salts have also effectively assumed a role 
in photoredox catalysisa process that has emerged 
as a fullfledged alternative in organic synthesis, 
often unlocking transformations that are not 
attainable in the dark.36 Photoredox catalysis relies 
on an electron transfer process between a highly 
reactive, lightexcited catalyst and a redoxlabile 
substrate (S). The result is a reactive radical 
intermediate that undergoes further transformations, 
ultimately resulting in the formation of new bonds 
under mild conditions.
