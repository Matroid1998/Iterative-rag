Description:
Used as a ligand in the attempted synthesis of compound 11.

Further 
investigation of ligands revealed that neither L5 nor L6 produced 
the desired compound 11, and only the starting material was 
recovered (entries 6 and 7). Finally, when aminoquinoline L7 was 
used as a ligand, the target compound 11 was still not obtained, 
and the byproduct oxindole 12 was observed instead (entry 8). Various screenings of solvents and bases were also conducted, 
but none of them yielded the desired compound 11; only the 
starting material was recovered, or complex mixtures were 
produced (see the Supporting Information). From these results, it
