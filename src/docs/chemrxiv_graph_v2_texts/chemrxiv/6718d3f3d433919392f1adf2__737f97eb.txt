Description:
Isosteric enthalpy of adsorption and isotherms are provided for CH4 in some MOF structures.

The CoRE MOF database (2019 Dataset) provides the surface area, pore volume, and 
pore size for 14,355 frameworks in addition to their coordinates in CIF format.3, 6, 9 Hypothetical 
databases generated by computational algorithms generally have two types One is the bottomup 
algorithm, where Wilmer et al. generated 137,953 MOF structures by using metal clusters and 
organic linkers shown in experimentally defined MOF structures.5c Another is ToBaCCo 
(Topologically Based Crystal Constructor),5df in which algorithms arrange building blocks into 
given topologies.10 This hypothetical database demonstrates 13,511 structures with their density, 
void fraction, surface area, pore volume. This also provides isosteric enthalpy of adsorption and 
isotherms for XeKr, H2, and CH4 in some MOF structures.
