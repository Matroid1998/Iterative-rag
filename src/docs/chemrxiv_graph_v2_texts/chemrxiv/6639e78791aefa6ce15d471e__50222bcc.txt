Description:
Formed from the reduction of Weinreb amides, preventing overreduction to alcohol.

Text:
Considering that 
Weinreb amides can be easily transformed not only to aldehydes by 
reduction, which prevents overreduction to alcohol, but also to 
ketones by nucleophilic addition of alkyl lithium and Grignard 
reagents,5 ,unsaturated Weinreb amides are attractive building 
blocks and functional moieties in organic synthesis. A Weinreb 
amidetype HWE reagent was first reported by Nuzillard in 1989,6 
and it was further developed by Seidel in 19927 (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. First Report of Weinreb Amidetype HWE Reagent. Nuzillard reported an (E)selective HWE reaction using nbutyl 
lithium (nBuLi) as a phosphonoenolategenerating reagent (Scheme 
1A).
