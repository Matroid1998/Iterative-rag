Description:
Used for van der Waals encapsulation to improve graphene's performance.

Text:
For example, polymerbased 
lithography, which is traditionally used to pattern graphene has been found to significantly 
reduce its device performance.79 Solutions to mitigate this include grain boundary engineering 
to control fieldeffect mobility10 and van der Waals encapsulation by hexagonal boron nitride.9 
However, in all of these cases, lithographic techniques limit the feature sizes to 10 nm due to 
the use of photoresist and limits imposed by the energy of the electromagnetic radiation. Higher resolution can be achieved by using electron beams (ebeams), and previous 
uses of ebeam for defect engineering in graphene involved a high acceleration voltage (80
300 kV) inside a transmission electron microscope11 to control the elastic (e.g. atomic 
displacement, knockon damage) and inelastic (e.g. heating) mechanisms induced by the e
beam.
