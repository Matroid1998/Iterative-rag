Description:
A complex with a theoretically predicted octahedral structure and an axial NO ligand.

Mossbauer spectroscopy in agree
34
ment with EPR study also indicated the presence of a FeNO7 species with a high spin
35
FeIII center antiferromagnetically coupled with a NO(S1) moiety. Eventually Monsch
36
and coworkers reported the crystal data for the Fe(H2O)5(NO)2 complex in their recent
37
study 6. The crystal could be isolated due the use of bulky gallate counter ion having
38
peruoropinacolato ligands. The XRD established the theoretically predicted octahedral
39
structure of the complex with an axial NO ligand.
