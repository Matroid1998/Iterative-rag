Description:
Loss at layered oxide cathodes can accelerate the degradation of lithium ion batteries.

Text:
Surface oxygen loss at layered oxide cathodes can accelerate the degradation of lithium ion 
batteries,1 with the proclivity of oxygen loss increasing with both Ni content and voltage. 26 While the 
oxygen loss occurs at high state of charge, cycling studies of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC811) cathode 
material have demonstrated how degradation is faster when compounded with the deep depth of 
discharge.7 For polycrystalline morphologies, intergranular cracking and oxygen loss can occur in 
tandem at high voltage,812 making it difficult to isolate the impact of oxygen loss on the cathode 
surface chemistry and its impact on the resultant electrochemistry. The suppressed intergranular 
cracking using singlecrystalline (SC) morphologies1315 offers the ability to directly correlate surface 
chemistry due to oxygen loss and its impact on cycling aging.

Description:
Loss occurs at high voltages in SC NMC811 pouch cell formats.

Text:
For example, a cycle protocol study of 
SC NMC811 in industriallyrelevant pouch cell formats supported by atomistic predictions 
demonstrated that while oxygen loss occurs at high voltages the resulting densification of a surface 
reconstructed layer requires a deep depth of discharge,16 and predicted that the transport properties 
of this layer will depend on the cycling conditions employed. Operando XRD (opXRD) can correlate the 
formation and densification of surface reconstruction with the evolution of the structure properties of 
the NMC cathode.
