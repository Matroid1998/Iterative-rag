Description:
Forms the basis of motors that generate robust unidirectional rotation with a central double bond between two carbons.

Text:
The same fundamental principles also apply to nonbiological
molecules, and indeed, exciting progress has also been made in the design and synthesis of articial
molecular motors that may mimic or even surpass their biological counterparts 4, 1, 5. In particular, the overcrowded alkenebased motors 6, 7 (abbreviated here as alkene motors)
generate robust unidirectional rotation, which has been harnessed in several demonstration applications
8, 9, 10, 11. The alkene motors have a central double bond between two carbons (Fig 1), which divides
the molecule into a lower part, referred to as the stator, and an upper part, referred to as the rotor.
