Description:
A polymer with a molecular weight of 1,300,000.

Text:
Along the way, handicraft work and safety considerations are 
encouraged, and simple experiments allow to experience and understand important phenomena and 
topics related to polymers, electricity, electrostatics, wetting and sustainability. Most of the 
35 
experiments can also safely be performed by high school students. INTRODUCTION 
Chemicals 
The ethyl acetate, formic acid and ethanol was purchased from VWR Chemicals and the reference 
polymers polystyrene (PS, MW 280,000) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW1,300,000) from Sigma 
40 
Aldrich. The concentrated hydrochloric acid was manufactured by the J.T. Baker Company, the 
vinegar essence and sunflower oil was obtained at a local store. StyrofoamExpanded polystyrene 
(EPS) packaging materialwaste (provided by any supplier of chemicals) was used for the development 
of the upcycling experiments.
