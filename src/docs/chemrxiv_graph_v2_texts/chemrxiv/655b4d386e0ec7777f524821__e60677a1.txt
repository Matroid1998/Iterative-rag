Description:
Chemical sensors based on metal oxides often face problems of low selectivity and high operating temperatures.

In the past few years, the interest in small, wearable sensors has increased significantly. Especially in the medical, sports tracking, and the virtual reality sectors, the market for reli
able, affordable, and sensitive sensors is growing quickly.1,2 Commercially available sensors,
e.g. chemical sensors based on metal oxides often face problems of low selectivity and high
operating temperatures.3,4 In contrast, organically capped or crosslinked metal nanoparticle
assemblies have shown promising sensing properties at room temperature.4,5 Gold nanopar
ticles (GNPs) are valuable due to their high stability and their wellcontrolled synthesis.6 In
particular in combination with thiols, GNP assemblies have been used as chemiresistors and
as strain sensors.711 Nowadays, various techniques for their fabrication exist,1218 opening
up the opportunity to design wellcontrolled thin films for different sensing applications.
