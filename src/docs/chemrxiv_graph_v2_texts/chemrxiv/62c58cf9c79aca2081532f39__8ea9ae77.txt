Description:
Used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents.

Text:
Since the introduction of gadolinium(III) based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agents, the solution structure of 
lanthanide complexes with octadentate ligands have been studied in great detail.15 Of these only the complexes of 1,4,7,10
tetraazacyclododecane1,4,7,10tetraacetic acid DOTA,6 and ligands derived from this structure,718 have been shown to be 
kinetically inert.19, 20 Thus, Ln.DOTA complexes can be studied without considering the speciation of the sample.20, 21 The integrity 
of the Ln(DOTA)(H2O) complexes have allowed for detailed studies of the interchange between the forms the Ln.DOTA complex 
can have in solution. Detailed information is available elsewhere,3, 5, 2126 briefly the Ln.DOTA complexes can be with or without 
capping water. For gadolinium(III) and europium(III), the ninecoordinated complex with a capping water dominates.
