Description:
A material used in catalysis, medical technologies, environmental applications, and aluminum engineering.

In 2015, higher than 57 million tons essential Al was produced, whereas the
global Al2O3 production was larger than 115 million tons. Indeed, the principal raw material sources for alumina
generation are bauxite and nepheline ores. Other sources such Al2O3 extraction from Kaolin and high Al2O3
containing clays have been featured. So, for that, according to the Jesef Bayer process, Alumina is generated via
Bauxite Ore processing, where bauxite ore is digested with lime addition by sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH). The following fig.1, gives a brief description of this natural resource processing to yield the wellknown material
(Al2O3) which can subsequently might be considered for a wide range of applications, including catalysis,
medical technologies, environment uses, and Aluminum (Al) and its alloys engineering. Fig.1.
