Description:
Used as a support for poly(Srlimonene) to remove mercury from water.

Text:
For instance, the addition of an accelerator or catalyst in the 
73 
synthesis allowed the material to be made at a lower temperature, which reduced byproduct 
74 
formation and increased the safety profile of the synthesis.29 Furthermore, Hasell also 
75 
demonstrated that poly(Srlimonene), when coated on a silica gel support, is effective at 
76 
removing mercury from water.29 However, these studies were focused more on the poly(Sr
77 
limonene) synthesis rather than mercury sorption, so there is a need to understand the detailed 
78 
kinetics of mercury sorption and the scope of conditions under which it is effective. Herein, we 
79 
report our findings on the first detailed kinetic analysis and modelling of this sorbent in both 
80 
Hg2 uptake and desorption.
