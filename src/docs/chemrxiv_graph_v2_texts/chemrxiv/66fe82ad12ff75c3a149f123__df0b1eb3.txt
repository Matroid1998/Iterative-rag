Description:
A molybdenum-based TMD with prominent properties.

Text:
In recent years, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) have garnered considerable attention amid other twodimensional
(2D) materials due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical
properties 16. The foundation of the wide range of effects exhibited
lies within their characteristic structure. TMD monolayer has a sand
wich form consisting of a transition metal layer trapped between two
made of chalcogenides (S, Se, Te). The adopted coordination symme
try can result in trigonal prismatic (1H), octahedral (1T), or distorted
octahedral (1T) phase, described by hexagonal P6m2, trigonal P3m1,
or monoclinic P21m space group, respectively. Molybdenumbased TMDs, that is, MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2, are
prominent among the others.
