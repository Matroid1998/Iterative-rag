Description:
A molecule that can be activated by transition metals and some main group complexes for catalytic hydrogenation.

Text:
The activation of dihydrogen is a phenomenon that, until recent years, was associated primarily with 
transition metals.1,2 Significant developments have seen main group complexes reported for the 
activation of dihydrogen,36 and applications of these systems in catalytic hydrogenation.710 The 
activation of dihydrogen using zinc compounds has received little attention. Zinc, as a posttransition 
metal, does not employ its delectrons and so its reactivity is likely to mimic that of a main group center. Dihydrogen activation at zinc is an unusual observation. Although there have been previous reports of 
the use of zincbased catalysts for hydrogenation, the fundamental understanding of this process has 
received limited attention.

Description:
Activated through metal-ligand cooperation in zinc catalyzed hydrogenation.

Text:
For example, Beller and coworkers reported the use of zinc triflate, Zn(OTf)2, 
as a precatalyst for the hydrogenation of imines.11 Stephan and coworkers also used a zincbased 
catalyst for the hydrogenation of imines and ketones.12,13 Milstein and coworkers provided an example 
of zinc catalyzed hydrogenation of imines and ketones, using a PNP pincer ligand to facilitate dihydrogen 
activation through metalligand cooperation.14 Despite these reports, the application of zinc to 
hydrogenation catalysis remains understudied, with substrates limited to highly polarized species. Furthermore, the issue of selective hydrogenation with these types of catalysts is yet to be addressed.
