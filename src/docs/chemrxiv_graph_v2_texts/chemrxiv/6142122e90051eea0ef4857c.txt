Description:
Used in supercritical form for solid form generation methods.

Text:
Current 
methods for generation of solid forms include evaporation, 
slurry conversion, melt extrusion, mechanochemical grinding, 
spraydrying, 
spraycongealing, 
solventantisolvent, 
supercritical CO2, freezedrying, jet dispensing, high shear wet 
granulation, sublimation and acoustic methods.17 Even with 
the numerous existing approaches to solid form generation, a 
significant challenge remains to produce industrial quantities of 
pharmaceutical solids, predominantly cocrystals, reliably and 
economically while adhering to all regulatory guidelines within 
good manufacturing practices (GMP).8,9 Currently, solvent
based methods are still preferred by major pharmaceutical 
industry, despite the fact that reliance on solvent methods 
increases costs and the environmental impact.10 Such solvent methods can also create high levels of residual solvent,
