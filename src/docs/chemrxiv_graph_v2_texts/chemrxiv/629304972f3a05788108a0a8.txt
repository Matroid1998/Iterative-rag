Description:
A photocatalyst used in a wide range of transformations, including alkylation, arylation, acylation, amination, fluorination, trifluoromethylation, sulfinylation, and oxygenation.

Among the 
40 
limited selection of photocatalysts promoting HAT, arguably the most versatile HAT 
41 
photocatalyst is the decatungstate anion, which found application in a wide range of 
42 
transformations, including alkylation,38 arylation,9 acylation,10 amination1114, fluorination,1517 
43 
trifluoromethylation,18 sulfinylation19 and oxygenation (Scheme 1A).20, 21

Despite the potential of TBADT for synthetic applications, the adoption of photocatalytic 
45 
HAT in industrial processes is still limited.
