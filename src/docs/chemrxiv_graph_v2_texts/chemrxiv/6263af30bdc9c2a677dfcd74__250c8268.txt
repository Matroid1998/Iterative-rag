Description:
A derivative used in thermoswitchable near-infrared emission and phototherapy applications.

Text:
Herein, we report a series of polyestertethered molecular 
chromophores by controllable polymerization from the two ends of 
a pyrrolopyrrole cyanine (PPcy) derivative as the initiator (Scheme 1, 
S1a). The chemical structures and chain lengths of the polyesters 
play a critical role in finetuning the excitonic coupling among PPcy 
chromophores within colloidal nanoparticles in water. Moreover, we 
present a new type of thermoswitchable nearinfrared (NIR) 
emission caused by the reversible transformation between 
monomeric (M) and Jaggregate states of the fluorophores. We 
further demonstrate the potential of these thermosensitive 
materials for applications such as tumor imaging and the high 
efficiency of phototherapy.
