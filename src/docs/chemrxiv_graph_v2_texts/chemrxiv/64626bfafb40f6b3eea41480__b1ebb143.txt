Description:
An antibiotic possessing potent antibacterial activity.

In the past decade, a large number of targetspecific, biarylcontaining peptide macrocycles have 
attracted the attention of researchers for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.1 As a 
result of their target selectivity and strong binding affinity, biaryl cyclic peptides represent promising 
scaffolds in the development of novel bioactive compounds.24 Especially noteworthy are the 
antibiotics vancomycin and the arylomycin analog G0775, each possessing potent antibacterial 
activity (Figure 1A).2 Heterobiaryl peptides have also garnered attention in recent years. The 
heterobiarylcontaining peptide macrocycle complestatin (also known as chloropeptin II) possesses 
activity against HIV.
