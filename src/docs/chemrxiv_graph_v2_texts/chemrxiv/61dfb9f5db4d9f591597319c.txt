Description:
A substrate activated for cross-coupling through oxidative addition to Ni(I).

Text:
The importance of this process is 
twofold first, oxidative addition to Ni(I) activates an aryl halide 
substrate for crosscoupling; second, it provides access to the 
Ni(III) oxidation state, which is more electrophilic than Ni(II) 
and more readily undergoes challenging reductive eliminations. The significance of oxidative addition to Ni(I) is perhaps best 
illustrated by studies demonstrating that Cheteroatom cross
couplings may proceed through a selfsustaining Ni(I)Ni(III) 
catalytic cycle.1013 
Unfortunately, the sparsity of welldefined Ni(I) complexes 
has hampered the use of classical organometallic tools for stud
ying this oxidative addition process and its underlying mecha
nism. This holds true for systems bearing ligands from the bi
pyridine (bpy) or phenanthroline (phen) classes, which are of
ten utilized in synthetic
