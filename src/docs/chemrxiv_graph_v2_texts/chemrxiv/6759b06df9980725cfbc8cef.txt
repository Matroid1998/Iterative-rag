Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and can be captured directly from ambient air.

Text:
The average global temperature has been steadily rising since the late 19th century and was c.a. 1.2 
Celsius degree warmer in 2023 than the preindustrial average.1 This warming is largely driven by 
greenhouse gas emissions, with CO accounting for over 60  of the effect.2 Amongst various strategies 
to manage CO2 emission levels, direct air capture (DAC) offers a solution by capturing CO2 directly from 
ambient air.3,4 This process is challenging due to trace amounts of CO2 concentration (around 400 ppm) 
and low selective capturing of CO2 over atmospheric water vapor.

Description:
A gas that is commonly captured using chemisorption techniques.

Text:
To date, DAC technologies have predominantly relied on chemisorption of CO2 using amines and solid 
alkali hydroxides, due to their strong affinity for CO2.5,6 However, the regeneration of adsorbents is the 
dominant source of the total operational costs.7,8 To mitigate these issues, physisorptionbased materials 
with weaker CO2 interactions have been explored to reduce regeneration costs with repeated usage.9 
Among these, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) stand out due to their high surface area and remarkable 
tunable properties.10,11 However, the chemical space for forming MOFs is vast due to the large number of 
possible chemical building blocks and topologies.

Description:
A gas targeted for capture in MOFs designed for flue gas applications.

Text:
To expedite the identification and design of promising MOFs for CO2 capture, largescale screening has 
been widely applied.1217 These are typically based on classical molecular simulations with force fields, 
such as universal force fields (UFFs)18 with point charges (e.g. Qeq,19 EQeq,20 and DDEC21). For CO2 
capture, Boyd et al., designed new MOFs suitable for flue gas CO2 capture by introducing CO2 responsive 
pockets acquired from screening results.15 Findley et al.
