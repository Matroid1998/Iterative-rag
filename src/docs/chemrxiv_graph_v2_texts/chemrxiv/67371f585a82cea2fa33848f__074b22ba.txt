Description:
Possesses a wide electrochemical stability window despite being metastable.

Text:
Subsequent experimental and density functional theory
(DFT) studies, however, have placed the conductivity to
be much lower with a higher migration barrier(0.6 eV
and 106 S cm127,28). Both nominally Li3OCl and
Li3OBr have been shown to possess wide electrochemical
stability windows even if they are metastable and not in
a global ground state. This has been attributed due to its
lack of reducible cations to Limetal, yet may form Li2O
and LiClBr at the anode.29 Additional antiperovskite
ionic conductor compositions have been reported includ
ing, Na3OClBr30,31, Na3SI32 and Na3HS33 to name a
few. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024n3zvr ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000262421121 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
