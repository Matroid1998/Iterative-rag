Description:
A frequent N-heterocyclic fragment featured in FDA-approved drugs.

Text:
Enantioenriched indole derivatives are of great interest in pharmaceutical science and organic 
chemistry.1 Particularly, the indole core is one of the most frequent Nheterocyclic fragment 
featured in FDAapproved drugs.2 Therefore, different methods have been designed for the 
construction of chiral indole scaffolds.3 The most typical functionalizations of indoles take place 
at the C3 positions, due to their innate nucleophilicity.4 In contrast, the development of 
techniques involving a stereocenter adjacent to the nitrogen, an essential structural motif 
imbedded in many biologically active molecules (Figure 1A),5 remains a great challenge, 
presumably owing to the attenuated nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom (Figure 1B). To this 
end, a few powerful CN bondforming approaches have been developed to access chiral N
alkylindoles (Figure 1C).

Description:
A substrate often used in enantioselective intramolecular addition reactions.

Text:
However, these transformations often rely on the enantioselective 
intramolecular addition of prefunctionalized indole substrates,6 or intermolecular Nalkylation 
(mostly Nallylation) of indoles with C3blocking substituents7 or electronwithdrawing groups.8 
Moreover, indirect methods using indole precursors such as indolines or aryl hydrazines were 
also developed to obtain high regio and enantioselectivity.9 Recently, Buchwald and Vilotijevic 
demonstrated elegant works using Nmodificated strategy to engage N(benzoyloxy)indoles and 
Nsilyl indoles in CN bondforming reactions, respectively.10 Despite these remarkable 
advances, a general, modular and selective synthesis of enantioenriched Nalkylindoles is in 
crucial demand, particularly if the substrates and catalysts are readily available.11 In sharp 
contrast to CN bondforming process, we questioned whether a relevant CC bondforging 
strategy could allow the coupling of indolebased Nalkylmetal intermediates with electrophiles 
for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral Nalkylindole architectures (Figure 1D).12, 13 
The catalytic enantioselective hydrocarbonation of alkenes, enabled by an insitu generated 
alkylmetal intermediate through hydrometallation of double bonds, has currently emerged as an 
attractive protocol for the construction of CC bonds containing at least a stereogenic sp3 
carbon.14 However, the alkenes have been classically limited to Csubstituted alkenes (G  C, H; 
Figure 1D), e.g., styrene derivatives.15 Catalytic asymmetric hydrocarbonations of heteroatom
substituted alkenes are comparatively underdeveloped (G  B, N, O, F; Figure 1D).16 With 
respect to readily available Nindolylsubstituted alkenes,17 their catalytic enantioselective 
hydrocarbonation is yet to be disclosed to our knowledge (G  Nindolyl, Figure 1D ), but it is 
highly anticipated given that the desired chiral Nalkylindoles and their derivatives could easily 
be assembled with this strategy.
