Description:
Pivotal in promoting catalytic activity in alkaline media for the oxygen evolution reaction.

The electrolysis of water (2H2O  2H2  O2) to produce hydrogen fuel is critical 
47 
for renewableenergy infrastructure1, 2. Even in optimized electrolyzers, the efficiency is 
48 
reduced by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH  2H2O  4e 
49 
 O2 in alkaline media)3, 4. Among the many OER catalysts studied over decades, Fe is 
50 
broadly pivotal in promoting the catalytic activity in alkaline media57. In particular, Ni and 
51 
Co (oxy)hydroxides require Fe to achieve high activity, regardless of whether it is 
52 
introduced intentionally or incidentally8, 9. Sustaining the high activity of these Fe
53 
containing (oxy)hydroxides requires soluble Fe species in the electrolyte due to the 
54 
dynamic Fe exchange at the catalystelectrolyte interface1013.

Description:
Induces a positive shift in the M2M3 redox potential when substituted.

Text:
Prior to 
65 
OER, Fedoped M(OH)2 is oxidized to (nominally) MOOH, accompanied by a 
66 
contraction of the MO bond length and interlayer distance, consistent with stronger MO 
67 
bonds upon formal cation oxidation25. Fe substitution induces a positive shift of the 
68 
apparent M2M3 redox potential, indicative of electronic interactions between Fe and host 
69 
Ni or Co cations. The oxidation state of Fe during OER at the active site remains a point 
70 
of discussion. Both Fe3 and Fe4 were found under OER conditions for codeposited Ni
71 
Fe or CoFe (oxy)hydroxides, while in nonaqueous electrolyte Fe6 was identified and 
72 
invoked as the active intermediate2629.
