These nanomaterials include carbons, transition metals, supported transition metals, alloys, minerals in combination with
other metals, coreshell materials, metal organic frameworks, zeolites, with diverse method of preparations. As known also,
many elements from the rareearth materials might possess advanced properties such as magnetic characteristic
(Neodymium) , lighting features (La), constituent of an exceptional sort of glass (Praseodymium), MRI, Xray scanning
method, and television screens (Gadolinium), catalytic at high temperature (CeriumLa), optical displays in devices (Yttrium,
terbium, europium). So, in recent years researchers worldwide are exploring this class of intelligent materials in order to
create an advanced nanomaterials for diverse technologies 10.
