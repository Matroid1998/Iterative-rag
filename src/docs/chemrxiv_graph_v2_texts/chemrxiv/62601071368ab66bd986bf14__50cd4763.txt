Description:
Compositionally identical to diamond but structurally distinct, resulting in different properties.

The exponential increase in crystal structures deposited in databases such as the inorganic 
crystal structure database (ICSD 1) and Cambridge structural database (CSD 2) continually 
expands our exploration of a multidimensional structurecomposition (SC) space. The 
arrangement of atoms and their types defined within this SC space is intrinsically linked to all 
physical properties of a material; if two materials are proximate in SC space, their properties 
are similar. For example, diamond and cubic boron nitride both adopt a cubic diamond 
structure, and carbon atoms are chemically similar to both boron and nitrogen. As a result, 
both materials are superhard. 3 In contrast, diamond and graphite are compositionally 
identical but structurally distinct, giving very different properties for these polymorphs.
