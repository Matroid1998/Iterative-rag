Important cathode materials for SIBs due to their compositional variety and ability to provide high redox potentials combined with high capacities.

Layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, where TM is a transition metal and x 
indicates the amount of Na per formula unit) are one of the most important classes of 
cathode materials for SIBs due to their compositional variety and their ability to 
provide high redox potentials combined with high capacities.1a, 2, 5 In addition, 
previous studies have suggested that oxygen may also be actively involved in the 
electrochemical reaction between many layered oxides at high voltages, further 
improving the practical electrode capacity.6 Among the layered oxides, Nicontaining 
layered oxides for SIBs have attracted significant attention due to their high operating 
voltages and large capacities.
