INTRODUCTION 
The thioredoxinthioredoxin reductase (TrxTrxR) and the 
glutaredoxinglutathioneglutathione reductase (GrxGSHGR) 
systems are central to maintaining cellular redox homeodynamics.1 
These relay systems use NADPH to balance many arms of redox 
chemistry via the redoxin (Trxfold) family of proteins2,3 
controlling metabolic processes including nucleic acid synthesis, 
as well as thiol redox proteome switches, and antioxidant defense.4 
Despite their key roles in biology, the Trx and Grx systems have 
long lacked highquality probes that could monitor and decrypt 
their activity in living cells. Conceptually, a suitable turnover probe 
could feature an artificial redox substrate that is selectively reduced 
by a specific vicinal dichalcogenide redoxin (Grxs, Trxs, TrxRs), 
then fragments irreversibly to accumulate a noninvasive readout 
(e.g., release a fluorophore).

An initial attacking group in reactions with cyclic dichalcogenides.

Cyclic dichalcogenide 
redox substrates can be used to avoid reduction by millimolar 
cellular monothiols (two consecutive monothiol additions) while 
selecting for micromolar vicinal dithiols (bimolecular reaction).6 
This arises since their onethioladducts have high effective 
molarity for intramolecular retroaddition kT1 that leads to 
expulsion of the initial attacking thiol before a second resolving 
thiol can add intermolecularly (Figure 1b, I).7 Yet, with a single 
equivalent of a vicinal dithiol, retroaddition kR1 can be out
competed by intramolecular resolution kR2 to complete the 
reduction and trigger a readout (c.f.
