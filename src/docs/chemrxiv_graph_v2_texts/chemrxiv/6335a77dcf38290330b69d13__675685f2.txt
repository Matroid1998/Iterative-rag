Description:
Used as a reference compound for side chain NH bonds.

Text:
However, while in the past often used, B3LYP is one of
the less well performing functionals for radical reactions.6 Also,
the set of references used previously5 lacks proper reference com
pounds for benzylic CH, carboxylic OH, and aromatic NH
bonds. Instead, tertbutyl amine was used as a reference com
pound for all side chain NH bonds. We report XH BDEs of amino acids in proteins computed us
ing the isodesmic reaction method at the BMK631G(2df,p)7
level of theory. We validate our BMK results by comparing the
BDEs of smaller amino acids to results obtained at the G4(MP2)
6X8 level of theory.
