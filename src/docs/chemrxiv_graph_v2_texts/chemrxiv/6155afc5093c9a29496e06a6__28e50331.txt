Description:
An all-nitrogen coordinated precursor known as Co(DAD)2 that has led to advancements in ALD and material science.

Text:
This is surprising as the two all
nitrogen coordinated precursors Co(II) bis(ditertbutylacetamidinate),8 and Co(II) bis(di
tertbutyldiazadienyl) (Co(DAD)2)9 have led to significant advancements in ALD and 
material science. While the likely best known Co(II) silylamide Co(N(SiMe3)2)22 in the 
following referred to as Co(TMSA)22 has not found application in this field yet, the recent
