Description:
Typically serves as the 'A' component in the apatite formula.

The YIn1xMnxO3 series has also been 
shown to have excellent nearinfrared reflectance and show potential as cool pigments for use 
to reflect solar heat such as roofing materials 14. However, the cost associated with indium
based precursors causes an issue with these compositions. Other Mncontaining compounds have also been studied for their colour such as 
brownmillerite and apatite type structures, although these colours tend to range from 
turquoise to dark green depending on manganese content 1519. The apatite material has 
the general formula A10(MO4)6X2 where typically A  Ca, Sr, Ba or La, M Si, Ge, P or V and X  
O, OH or halides 2023.
