Description:
A framework that can be converted into different-sized cyclic amines through insertion or contraction reactions.

Recently, peripheral functionalization 
through latestage CH functionalization has become a mod
ern and popular method, offering versatile and efficient ways 
to embellish these amines.27 In contrast to such peripheral 
functionalization, skeletal remodeling, which involves de
construction and reediting the core ring structure, has recently 
garnered significant attention as a new approach in organic 
synthesis.813 Skeletal remodeling can be divided into two 
phases the cleavage of inert bonds and further transformations. This allows for the conversion of pyrrolidine frameworks into 
differentsized cyclic amines through insertion or contraction 
reactions, or into carbocycles through replacement reactions.
