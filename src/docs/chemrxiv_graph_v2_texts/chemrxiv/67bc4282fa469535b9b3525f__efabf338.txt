expanded this work by showing that 1 can also be formed using Na and K metals as reducing agents in 
1,2 dimethoxy ethane (DME),31 and that the spectra obtained with potassium was comparable to Geske 
electrochemical data. Continuing with the use of metals as reducing agents, Ling and Gendell first reported 
the formation of contact ion pairs 1X (X  Li, Na, K, Cs) in DME,32 where the HFCs to the nuclear 
spins of the alkali metals (I32 for 7Li, 23Na and 39K, I72 for 133Cs) were resolved. They found sizeable 
variations of all HFCs with temperature and a combination of separated and contact ion pairs in mixed 
solutions of DME and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Description:
Used in liquid ammonia solution for ion pair formation studies.

Smentowski then reported 1 formation using 
Lithium, Sodium and Potassium in liquid ammonia solution at 50 C,33 whose HFCs were comparable to 
those measured in other solvents electrochemically.30 Gross et al., performed a detailed study of the effect 
of the solvent polarity on the contact (separated) ion pair formation and the HFCs of 1X (X  Li, Na, 
K, Rb, Cs).34,35 They conclude that the measured EPR linewidths are directly proportional to the ionic radius
