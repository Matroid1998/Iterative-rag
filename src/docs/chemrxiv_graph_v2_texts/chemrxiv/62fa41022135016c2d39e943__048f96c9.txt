4b), 
one consequence of which is that in the preferred anti atropoisomer, the metapyridyl hydrogens 
are diastereotopic so that, in the 1H NMR spectrum, the pyridine hydrogens present as two AB 
spin systems (Fig. 3b). However, when complexed to gold (Fig. 4c,d), the rings are forced to be co
planar and the two hydrogens become equivalent (Fig. 3c). (a)
