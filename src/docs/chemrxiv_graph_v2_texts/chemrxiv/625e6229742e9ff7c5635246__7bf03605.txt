Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis.

Text:
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two 
key reactions in a water electrolyser. Understanding the mechanisms of HER and OER is 
necessary to improve the energy efficiency of green hydrogen production via water splitting.

Description:
Involved in HER activity, dependent on metal-hydrogen binding strength.

Text:
The differences in the catalytic activities of metals towards HER in an acidic medium (0.5M 
H2SO4) is assumed to be explainable via the Sabatier Principle.1 According to the Sabatier 
principle, HER activity depends on metalhydrogen (EMH) binding strength, which leads to 
a volcano type plot when using EMH as a descriptor of the activity of metals for HER.2 In 
this scenario, metals like Pt or Ptgroup metals are excellent electrocatalysts for HER due to 
their thermoneutrality for hydrogen adsorption (optimum metalhydrogen binding energy 
leads to EMH 0 eV).3 But this reasoning cannot be extended to the alkaline HER, 
particularly it fails to explain the sluggish reaction kinetics of HER on Pt in alkaline media.

Description:
Can be present as under potential or over potential deposited hydrogen in alkaline medium.

Text:
One can observe under potential (HUPD) or over potential deposited (HOPD) hydrogen 
presence in alkaline medium too by applied potential controlled surface enhanced 
spectroscopy with surfaces like Pt.4,5 Due to the limited availability of protons in low acidic 
conditions, water is a more likely source of adsorbed hydrogen, and the dissociation energy 
of water adds an extra contribution to the Gibbs free energy of the Volmer step (H2O  e 
H OH). Hence, the rate determining steps of HER are different in alkaline and acidic 
electrolytes, and a clear understanding of the mechanism is essential for the designing of next 
generation cost effective catalysts for this process.
