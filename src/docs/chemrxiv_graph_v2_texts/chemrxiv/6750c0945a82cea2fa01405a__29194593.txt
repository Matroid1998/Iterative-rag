Description:
Materials whose framework phases are directed by OSDAs during synthesis.

Text:
More recent work using support vector machines has indicated that
formation energies of siliceous frameworks alone are insufficient for identify
ing synthesis targets from hypothetical frameworks 8. Instead, accounting
for the most likely feasible composition of hypothetical frameworks can in
crease the likelihood of identifying synthesis targets. OSDAs are molecules
that template the void spaces of these zeolite materials during synthesis, thus
directing the formation of distinct framework phases. OSDAs are typically
composed primarily of C, N, and H, where the N atoms in these molecules
are often quaternary cations. While other synthesis parameters can be tuned
to affect the final zeolite phase that forms, the selection of an OSDA (when
used) is vital in controlling the zeolite framework that forms during synthe
sis.
