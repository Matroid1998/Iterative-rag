Description:
Involved in intercalation-deintercalation kinetics critical to the power characteristics of Li ion batteries.

Text:
While research and development efforts have 
been focused on the electrodes and the electrolytes to boost the energy density,13 little is known 
about the intercalationdeintercalation kinetics of the Li ions,46 which is critical to the power 
characteristics of Li ion batteries.7 Generally, the intercalation kinetics can be governed by two 
distinct steps adsorption of Li ions at the electrified electrodeelectrolyte interface from the 
electrolyte, and the transfer of Li ions from the adsorbed state to the intercalated state coupled 
with electron transfer and electrode reduction.810 The deintercalation kinetics can have these 
processes in reverse, and enhancing our understanding of the underlying molecular processes in 
both intercalation and deintercalation is crucial in achieving the higher performing batteries.11 
The Li ion adsorption kinetics are tied to Li ion energetics in the bulk electrolyte,12 at the 
electrified electrodeelectrolyte interface,13 and at the electrode surface,14,15 from which the driving 
force for Li ion adsorption and the thermodynamic barrier against Li ion adsorption can be 
extracted.

In another study, using Raman 
spectroscopy and AC impedance spectroscopy, Uchida et al.30 reported that increasing the 
association between Li ions and anions in the electrolyte reduces the activation energy for Li ion 
adsorption from the electrolyte into the graphite. Using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics
