Description:
A functional group in proteins involved in hydrogen-deuterium exchange.

Text:
In HDX
63 
MS, a protein is diluted into a deuterated buffer enabling HD exchange of its labile backbone amide 
64 
hydrogens. This reaction is quenched at different time intervals by dropping pH and temperature to 2.5 
65 
and 0 C, respectively. The quenched protein sample is then digested by an acidlabile protease (e.g. pepsin) 
66 
into peptides and the incorporation of deuterium measured by liquid chromatography (LC)MS analysis. 67 
Post deuterium labeling, however, lipids can cause manifold issues in the bottomup HDXMS workflow15. 68 
These problems range from a reduced protein digestion efficiency due to potential interference with the 
69 
protease, to fouling of the liquid chromatography system, peptidelipid coelution that adds to spectral 
70 
complexity, and peptide ion suppression. 71
