Description:
A major concern in emissions from thermochemical processes due to heating by fossil fuels.

Text:
Mitigating carbon emissions and ensuring clean energy accessibility are the primary driving goals 
for the development of sustainable energy technologies. A number of studies have been reported 
for the development of thermochemical reaction processes for LOHC cycling applications.116 
Nevertheless, carbon emissions is still a major concern of these processes owing to heating by 
fossil fuels. One of the major motivating factors for introducing electrochemical reactions for 
LOHC cycling1727 is reducing carbon emissions by integrating with renewable electricity sources. Thus, for electrochemical LOHC cycling processes to be considered practically, it has to have a 
significantly lower carbon footprint to that of the thermochemical processes. In this report, we 
perform a comparative analysis of the carbon footprint for the thermochemical, electrochemical 
and hybrid LOHC cycling processes.
