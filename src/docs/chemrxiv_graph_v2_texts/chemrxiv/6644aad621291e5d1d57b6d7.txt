Description:
ntype doping of diamond is suppressed by low dopant concentrations and large activation energies.

8 Even when
achieved, either ptype (boron B) 9 or ntype (nitrogen N or phosphorus P), 10 doping of
diamond is suppressed by low dopant concentrations, limited by thermodynamic solubility,
and large activation energies from the deep ingap dopant levels. 11, 12 Moreover, the prac
tice of heavy doping undesirably decreases the carrier mobility. 13 Among the efforts to
overcome these obstacles and realize diamondbased semiconductor devices, a welldeserved
attention is captured by the transfer doping, which is achieved by integrating a thin layer
of acceptor on the hydrogenated diamond (Hdiamond) surface. 1419 The acceptor layer
candidates range from gas adsorbates, 14, 20 metal oxides, 18, 21, 22 to van der Waals
twodimensional (2D) materials.
