Description:
Functional motifs in small molecules that can act as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors and modulate solubility and bioavailability.

Text:
Secondary alkylamines are one of the most commonly occurring 
functional motifs in small molecules that perturb biological 
processes.1 Their capacity to function as hydrogen bond donors 
or acceptors with proteins, as modulators of solubility and 
bioavailability on protonation, and as scaffolds to support small 
molecule 
topology 
makes 
them 
privileged 
features 
in 
pharmaceuticals 
and 
agrochemicals.
