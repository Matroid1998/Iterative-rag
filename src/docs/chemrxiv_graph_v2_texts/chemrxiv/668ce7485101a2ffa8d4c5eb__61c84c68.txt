Description:
A reaction that is insensitive to oxygen or water and can be performed under mild conditions.

Text:
In addition to fast kinetics, thiolMichael addition is particularly 
convenient as it is insensitive to oxygen or water and can be performed under mild reaction 
conditions 20. The reversibility of thiolMichael addition, enabled by an elimination reaction in 
some specific conditions, has been recently studied in the context of applications based on 
covalent adaptable networks (CANs) 21,22.
