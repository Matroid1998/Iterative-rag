Description:
Surround the active site of PPOs and influence substrate acceptance.

Text:
Understanding a PPOs function requires
understanding its substrate scope, and it is assumed that different substrates are accepted based on
the amino acids surrounding the active site of PPOs 4. Thus, knowing which polyphenols are
present in specific species might assist in better understanding the function of PPOs and the
involvement of both polyphenols and PPOs in biological pathways 9, 10. In general, extensive analysis of a high number of diverse polyphenols in different plants and
fungi species is limited to date, especially as numerous polyphenols exist (Fig. 1a). To measure a
multitude of polyphenols simultaneously, liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass
