Description:
A self-doped n-type material with electron concentrations varying over several orders of magnitude (10^15 to 10^19 cm^3).

Text:
TE materials are often optimized through defect engineering,
which can increase (or decrease) the concentration of charge car
riers and decrease lat through increased phonon scattering. The
formation of point defects is strongly influenced by the synthe
sis conditions, including the reaction temperature. Very small
compositional differences, too small to detect by typical chemi
cal analysis or XRD can result from minute differences in synthe
sis of the same nominal composition and lead to strikingly dif
ferent electron transport properties. Such variations can be ex
plored experimentally through phase boundary mapping.30 Such
defects, could explain the variation of reported electron concen
trations in selfdoped ntype Bi2SeO2 that span several orders of
magnitude (1015  1019 cm3) even in materials with the same
nominal composition.
