Description:
A derivative used to produce a remarkable amount of EPOs.

Text:
In order to overcome hypoxiarelated limitations, the design and development of biocompatible 
molecular vectors able to deliver O2 directly to the target tissues is gaining significant attention in the 
pharmacological field.9 In this context, an increasing amount of literature focused on aromatic 
endoperoxides (EPOs) as suitable OxygenReleasing Agents (ORAs).10 The polycyclic aromatic 
precursors are cheap, versatile substrates able to reversibly bind and release O2 when properly 
functionalized and stimulated. The chemistry of these interesting EPOs has been deepened in the 
past11 and many aspects regarding their preparation and reactivity are now wellknown and 
established.12 Among others, the group of W. Fudickar and T. Linker was able to produce a remarkable 
amount of EPOs from both anthracene13,14 and naphthalene15,16 derivatives.

Description:
Used in the synthesis of derivatives tested as organic radical acceptors (ORAs).

Text:
The smooth release of O2 either in its triplet or singlet state is usually induced by thermolysis, driving to 
the restoration of the parent aromatic precursors.17 However, being these molecules studied in 
parallel for applications in the fields of electronic18 and optical19 devices, organic 
semiconductors20 and printing,21 the design of EPOs usually does not consider biocompatibility 
and often the temperatures needed for triggering the O2 release are above 50 C. 
In a previous work,22 a series of anthracene or naphthalene derivatives were synthesized and tested 
as ORAs (Figure 1).
