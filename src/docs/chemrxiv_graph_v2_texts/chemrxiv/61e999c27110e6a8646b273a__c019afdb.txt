Description:
A terpenic solvent used in the dissolution of polystyrene waste.

An
other route of recycling for PS, particularly suited for 
foams, proceeds through the dissolution of waste4 in sol
vents5 (including terpenics such as limonene) followed by 
recovery in supercritical CO2. Biodegradation of plastic 
waste, including that of PS, has been studied since the 
1960s. Researchers have attempted to use mixed microbial 
cultures and have isolated bacteria from various sources 
such as soil, garbage or sewage sludge to biodegrade vari
ous plastics into low molecular organics or mineralize to 
CO2. The ability of microorganisms to use polystyrene as a 
carbon source has been recently established.68 However, 
the high molar mass of commercial PS severely limits the 
efficiency of these enzymatic reactions.
