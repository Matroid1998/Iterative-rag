Description:
Forms clusters that exhibit Single-Molecule Magnet behavior, useful in high density data storage applications.

Text:
In the context of systems suitable for potential applications in 
high density data storage, the discovery of the SingleMolecule 
Magnet (SMM) behavior for a cluster of twelve manganese 
ions12 paved an exciting research way in the molecular mag
netism field.
