Description:
Groups that form dimers in Mg complexes.

The high abundance of magnesium in the Earths crust, coupled with its low toxicity,1 has 
driven considerable interest in exploring the potential of Mgbased complexes for various 
applications. Extending beyond the wellestablished organomagnesium chemistry pioneered 
by Grignard,2 Mg complexes have demonstrated utility in diverse reactions, including 
hydroelementation,38 Lewisacid catalysis,9,10 polymerisation,11 and dehydrocoupling.12 
These complexes are often stabilised by anionic diketiminate (NacNac) ligands, which employ 
hard nitrogen donors to support the Mg centres.13 The propensity for dimerisation (resulting 
in a Mg2X2 diamond core) in such systems is welldocumented, with a variety of bridging 
ligands, such as halides,1416 hydrides,17 amidoboranes,18 and alkyl groups,14,18 forming dimers 
that mitigate the electronic and coordinative unsaturation of monomeric species.
