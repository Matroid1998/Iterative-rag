Description:
Used in nanocapillaries to study high pressure values and unusual behavior of water under confinement.

Moreover, reported high pressure 
values within graphene nanocapillaries and computational studies suggesting unusual 
behaviour of water under such confinement make graphene nanocapillaries an intriguing vessel 
for new synthesis routines.3336 It is thus highly desirable to extend angstromconfined 
synthesis strategies to transform conventional nonvdW materials, such as TMO, into 2D form. This will enable us to explore unexpected properties of these 2D nonvdW materials.18 
A classic bottomup technique to grow thin nonvdW materials is electrochemical synthesis. However, it is yet illusive to limit the thickness of the grown material to (sub) unit cell 
thickness.18,37,38 In this case, space confinement might help to solve the issue.
