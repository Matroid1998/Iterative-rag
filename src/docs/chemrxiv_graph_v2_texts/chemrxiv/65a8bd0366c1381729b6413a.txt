Description:
A fundamental element involved in the metabolism and biosynthesis of aromatic ring-containing metabolites.

Text:
The shikimate pathway is the bridge between carbon source metabolism and biosynthesis of many aromatic ringcontaining metabolites. The major products of this pathways are the three aromatic amino acids i.e. Phenylalanine, Tyrosine and Tryptophan. This pathway is present 
only in plants and microbes like bacteria and yeast but never in animals. 1,2 The pathway not only secretes aromatic amino acids but many 
other important aromatic intermediates and aromatic biomolecules such as chorismite, dehydroshikimate, folates, salicylic acid, resveratrol, 
flavonoids, dopamine, and alkaloids.

Description:
Over 20% of all the fixed carbon flows through the shikimate pathway.

These molecules have a wide range of applications in developing valueadded aromatic compounds for 
food, agrochemical, fuel additive, cosmetics, dye, pharmaceutical and other industries, Figure 1.2,3 Over 20 of all the fixed carbon flows 
through this pathway.4 Shikimate pathway also plays an important intermediate in the production of antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir.5 
The quinoid core found in benzoquinone and ubiquinone is a derivative of the shikimate pathway in bacteria and yeast.6 Novel approaches 
that can help to understand or visualize the metabolites and metabolic pathways in situ (in its native position) or in vivo (inside the living 
system) are still in the inception stage. This is primarily attributed to the metabolome complexity and dynamic nature of biomolecules.
