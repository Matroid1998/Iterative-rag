Description:
A key component of carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites known for its remarkable specific strength and stiffness.

Text:
In recent decades, the remarkable specific strength and stiffness of carbon fibre reinforced 
polymer (CFRP) composites has drawn much attention, and made it widely applied in diverse 
fields, such as aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering. Despite its excellent mechanical 
behaviour, interfacial property is a key parameter which limits its performance. One approach 
to address this is with development of new composite fabrication methods, e.g., 3D weaving, 
stitching or zpinning to prevent the delamination and improve impact resistance, while facing 
challenges such as penetration, defects and porosity, etc. 13.

Description:
Used in the chemical modification of carbon fibres to improve interfacial properties.

Text:
On the other hand, some other 
methods without introducing the z direction fibres have been proposed to improve the 
interfacial properties, such as addition of nanomaterials (e.g., graphene related materials 4
16, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 14,1619, cellulose 20, MXene 21, etc.) and the chemical 
modification of carbon fibres (CFs) 22,23. In particular, graphene related materials (GRMs), owing to their exceptional mechanical, 
electrical and thermal properties, have been widely investigated 15,16. Some researchers 
decorated CFs with GRMs to improve the interfacial properties, among which the 
electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and fibre sizing methods were used widely. Gangineni et al. 8 studied several GRMs and found that the graphene carboxyl (GCOOH) one performs the 
best, which contributed to 9.6 and 22.9 improvement in flexural strength and interlaminar 
shear strength (ILSS) respectively.
