Description:
Generated using aryl onium reagents with mild bases.

Text:
Aryl onium reagents have emerged as aryne precur
sors during a resurgence of methods based on ortho
deprotonationelimination (Scheme 1b).713 These aryne 
precursors include those based on halogen leaving groups 
such as iodonium,7,8,12,1418 bromonium,9,19 and chloroni
um,10,19 as well as chalcogen leaving groups such as sul
fonium and oxonium (Scheme 1b).11,13,20,21 In several cases, 
these onium leaving groups permit the use of mild bases 
such as potassium and cesium carbonate and potassium 
phosphate to generate arynes,7,9,10,12,13,19,22 and these ap
proaches rival or even exceed the functional group com
patibility of fluorideinduced aryne generation of o
trimethylsilyl triflates.7 Although aryl onium reagents 
have provided a mild way to generate arynes via deproto
nation, they have not universally improved the generality 
and efficiency of accessing arynes.

Description:
Generated via deprotonative processes for net dehydrogenation of arenes.

Text:
In 2023 we 
merged the CH functionalization of arenes via thi
anthrenation and deprotonative aryne generation for a net 
dehydrogenation of simple arenes as an efficient way to 
access arynes (Scheme 1c).11 In our early optimization, we 
found that aryl thianthrenium salts were more easily ac
cessed than aryl(Mes)iodonium salts and we therefore 
developed a twostep sequence in which the aryl thi
anthrenium salts were isolated and subsequently used as 
aryne precursors (Scheme 1c). Although the isolation of
