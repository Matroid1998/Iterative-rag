Description:
Formed by the reaction of Li metal anode with hydrogen during cycling.

One critical problem regarding the cycling stability of batteries in commercial cell formats (limited 
dead volume), like pouch cells, is battery swelling911. Multiple aspects contribute to the overall 
swelling, including electrode stack swelling and gaseous swelling9,12. On one hand, SEI builds up 
upon fracture and growth during repetitive cycling and calendar aging13. On the other hand, the 
accumulation of gaseous byproducts, such as hydrogen gas, poses a significant risk to battery 
structural integrity as well as to safety due to their inherent flammability14,15. Moreover, these 
gaseous species can potentially react with the electrode to cause loss of lithium inventory16. For 
example, Li metal anode was hypothesized to react with hydrogen to form LiH during cycling17.
