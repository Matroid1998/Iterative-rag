Description:
Involved in metal-to-metal charge transfer absorption bands with cyanide complexes.

Text:
Metalcyanide complexes are known to bind at the 
surfaces of colloids and nanoparticulate films of TiO2 at low pH 
and to display metaltometal (cyanide complex to titanium) 
chargetransfer absorption bands in the visible region of the 
spectrum.3337 Binding entails formation of FeCNTi linkages, 
likely by displacement of aqua ligands from the metaloxide 
surface. Recognizing the close similarities in surfaceattach
ment chemistry for zirconia versus titania and noting that the 
MOFs nodes are essentially tiny pieces of zirconia, we rea
soned that similar binding of metalcyanide complexes to NU
1000 would be possible; such direct installations of metalcya
nide ions in MOFs have not been reported previously.
