Description:
Unlike magnesium, it is not characterized by low corrosion resistance.

Magnesium and its alloys are attractive and promising materials for the aerospace, 
56 
automotive, and medical industries due to their low density, excellent formability, nontoxicity, 
57 
and damping properties 14. However, unlike aluminum and titanium, Mg alloys are 
58 
characterized by a low corrosion resistance due to their high reactivity and the absence of a stable 
59 
passive oxide layer 58. At present, the main ways of tailoring mechanical and corrosion 
60 
properties of magnesium alloys are alloying, surface modification, as well as the use of corrosion 
61 
inhibitors 2,911. 62 
The main groups of Mg alloys used in industry are MgAlZn, MgCa, and MgREEs (rare
63 
earth elements) alloys 6,7,12. The AZseries MgAlZn alloys account for more than 90 of 
64 
currently used magnesium alloys 13.

Description:
Increases the strength, hardness, casting properties, and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys.

Text:
Alloying with aluminum makes it possible to increase the 
65 
strength, hardness, casting properties, and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys 2,14. The 
66 
microstructure of such alloys is a solid solution of aluminum and phase (Mg17Al12) in Mg, the 
67 
presence of which increases the corrosion potential and reduces its corrosion rate. 68 
Continuous technological development and search for new energysaving technologies 
69 
have promoted further development of ultralight and superplastic structural materials 15,16. 70 
Among them, magnesiumlithium (MgLi) alloys are the lightest metal engineering materials 
71 
16,17.
