Halogenated Hydrocarbons (HHCs)
Halogenated hydrocarbons (HHCs) are commonly used as ame suppressants and refrigerant
working uids. The rst generation of these compounds, chlorouorocarbons (CFCs) and
hydrochlorouorocarbons (HCFCs), depleted the ozone layer and were banned worldwide un
der the Montreal Protocol in the 1980s.1 The second generation, hydrouorocarbons (HFCs),
are ozonefriendly but are currently being phased out due to their high global warming po
tentials (GWPs).2 Despite these controls on highGWP HFC production, a recent study
discovered that emissions of HFC23 (CHF3), a potent greenhouse gas, reached an historic
high in 2018.3
To address these environmental concerns, several lowGWP HHC refrigerants and sup
pressants have been proposed.
