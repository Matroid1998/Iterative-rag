Description:
A rare and noble third-row transition metal.

However, these transformations have been 
exemplified mainly by employing rare and noble second and 
thirdrow TMs (Ru, Rh, Pd and Ir).7 The low natural 
abundances and high prices of these TMs hamper their 
applications in largescale processes.10 Therefore, it is 
noteworthy to develop CH activation protocols catalyzed by 
naturally abundant, nontoxic, and inexpensive first row TM 
catalysts.
