Description:
A bridged azobenzene with significantly improved EZ quantum yields due to the twisted preorientation of the Eisomer.

concludes that these AAPs should retain the lifetimes, 
excitation energies, conical intersections, and barrierless S1 potential energy surface of ABs.8 On the 
other hand, this similarity suggests that AAPs inherit an imperfection in the dynamics of typical ABs 
their Eisomer photoisomerization quantum yields are reduced in comparison to those of the Zisomer 
due to slower EZ than ZE switching dynamics.9,10 The groups of Herges and Temps found a solution 
for this problem dihydrodibenzodiazocine, a bridged azobenzene with significantly improved EZ 
quantum yields (50  instead of 24 for AB) due to the twisted preorientation of the Eisomer.11 The 
sensitivity of lifetimes in the photoexcited state to preorientation was hypothesized to originate from 
an initial stabilizing force that acts against the twisting force of the azo antibonding state.1215 
For an EAAP with two methyl groups in orthoposition of the phenyl ring, the DFT calculations by 
Bckmann and Doltsinis revealed a twisted groundstate geometry; note that in this case, the 
molecular twist is caused by sterical hindrance in contrast to the bridged AB which, in addition to the 
connecting azo moiety, requires an additional covalent CC linkage between the two rings.

dihydrodibenzodiazocine with its twisted Eisomer in combination with the theoretically predicted 
twisted groundstate geometry of the orthodimethylated AAP led us to the hypothesis that the latter 
should also exhibit a faster photoswitching dynamics than planar EAAP derivatives7. Therefore, we 
experimentally tested this hypothesis by using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy on four 
AAPs shown in Figure 1. The first AAP pair, comprising AAP1 with a hydrogen atom and AAP2 with an electrondonating 
methoxy group in the para position of the phenyl ring, has a planar Eisomer. The second AAP pair 
comprising AAP3 with a single and AAP4 with two methyl groups in ortho position of the phenyl ring 
has a twisted Eisomer.
