Description:
A third-generation macrolide lacking the cladinose residue to reduce efflux pump substrate activity.

Text:
Sugar residues on erythromycin, 
another macrolide inhibitor of translation, can 
be beneficial or detrimental to its antibiotic 
activity, depending on the context. The 
cladinose sugar of erythromycin acts as a 
handle used by the efflux pumps that confer 
macrolide resistance to bacteria. Efflux out of 
the bacterial cytoplasm prevents association 
with the ribosome, and therefore a loss of 
activity. In fact, so called third generation 
macrolides 
like 
telithromycin 
lack 
the 
cladinose residue by design so that the 
compound is a poor substrate for efflux.6,7 
Methymycin, erythromycin, and telithromycin 
all contain a desosamine sugar. Desosamine 
makes contacts with the RNA near the
