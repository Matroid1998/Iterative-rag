Description:
A commercially available reagent used for sulfation of DMSO and in situ release of Et3N.

Text:
Therefore, we considered whether a similar 
commercially available reagent Et3N.SO3 complex could achieve both the desired sulfation of 
DMSO and release Et3N in situ to deprotonate the alkoxysulfonium ion with increased atom 
economy (Chart 1). Chart 1. The original report by Parikh and Doering 1 and this work.
