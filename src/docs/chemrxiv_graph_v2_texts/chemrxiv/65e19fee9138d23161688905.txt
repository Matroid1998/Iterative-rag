Description:
Used in metal anodes to increase energy density by hindering dendrite formation and growth.

Text:
In this way, one can theoret
ically increase the energy density with the use of Li metal
anodes1 by physically hindering Li dendrite formation and
growth.2 Additionally, the use of SSEs will result in safer
batteries due to the removal of the highly ammable liq
uid electrolyte, thus facilitating a wider range of operating
temperatures.3 However, the implementation of SSEs has
proven challenging as current materials suering from low
ionic conductivities,4,5 poor air and water stability,6,7 poor
electrolyteelectrodeinterfaces,8 aswellasdendritegrowth
across grains and cracks, in spite of the solid electrolyte.9,10
Good contact between the electrolyte and the electrodes is
necessary to realise a wellfunctioning battery with long
term cyclability.

Description:
Forms an interface with LLZO that may result in a bottleneck to Li-ion conductivity.

Text:
To date, arguably the most
well studied garnet SSE is Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) displaying
relatively high Liion conductivities of 106 103 S
cm1 depending on doping, synthesis technique and en
vironment, and the structural phase of LLZO.1217 At room
temperature (RT), the structure is stable in its tetragonal
form(spacegroup I41acd), whilstathighertemperatures
it undergoes a phase transition into the disordered cubic
phase (space group Ia3d) which possesses ionic conduc
tivities around two orders of magnitude higher than the
tetragonal phase.12,18
The wide electrochemical stability window of LLZO al
lows it to benignly contact with Li metal anodes.12,19,20
However, a very thin layer of tetragonallike LLZO structure
has been observed at the interface between cubic LLZO
and Li metal19,21 potentially resulting in a bottleneck to the
Liionconductivityattheelectrolyteanodeinterface.
