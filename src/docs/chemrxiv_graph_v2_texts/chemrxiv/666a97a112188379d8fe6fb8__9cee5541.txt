Description:
Compounds with unique photophysical properties not yet integrated in BCPs.

Light is a very attractive stimulus, owing 
to its high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as the 
possibility to apply it externally. Most often, photoresponse is 
achieved by switching between two isomers of a molecular 
photoswitch through a reversible photoisomerization upon 
irradiation with light of a certain wavelength.2125 A 
wellstudied example is the photoswitch azobenzene which 
has been implemented in various photoresponsive BCPs.2629 
The related arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) have not yet been 
integrated in BCPs, despite their unique photophysical 
properties.
