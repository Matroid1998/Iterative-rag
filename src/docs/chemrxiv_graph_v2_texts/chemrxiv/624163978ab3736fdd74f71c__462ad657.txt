Description:
Refers to thiophene groups capping a molecule, affecting its properties.

Text:
Amide functionalities are among the best
known Hbonding forming groups,23 being the amide topology (N or C centered) a subtle, but very 
important parameter able to change the selfassembly of a given system and hence, the properties.24,25 
 In this work, we show amidecontaining thiophenecapped diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives 
with different amide topology to investigate its influence on the selfassembly, optoelectronic and 
charge transport properties. We compare two DPP derivatives containing amide groups with N or C
centered topology, attached to the lactams through flexible alkyl linkers. To provide solubility, we have 
added hexyl tails to the thiophene in the extremities of the molecule (Scheme 1). Furthermore, we have 
also synthesized a DPP molecule having only hexyl alkyl tails in the lactams and the thiophenes as a 
control.
