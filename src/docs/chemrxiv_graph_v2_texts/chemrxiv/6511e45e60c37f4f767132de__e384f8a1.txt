Synthetic strategies towards bbranched amino acids 
A breakthrough was reached upon recognition that the bbranched 
amino acid motifs for both 3 and 4 could, in principle, be derived 
from aziridine ring openings (Figure 1). While addition to aziridines 
has previously been demonstrated as a useful strategy for the 
synthesis of bbranched amino acids,21 very few examples exist for 
comparable additions to acarbonyl, baryl aziridines as was 
necessitated in the case of 2. In general, addition to aziridines 
requires the use of electronwithdrawing Nactivators (such as tosyl 
or nosyl protecting groups), which could potentially introduce 
further synthetic issues.

Description:
Used in direct addition into free-NH aziridines.

For instance, cleavage of Ntosyl is 
incompatible with use of an aryl bromide,2223 preliminary 
experiments indicated difficulties in controlling the reactivity for N
nosyl,24 and rearrangement is a known issue for carbamatebased 
protecting groups.2526 For these reasons, a more efficient approach 
was developed based on direct addition into freeNH aziridines. The 
bbranched motif of 4 could thus be traced back to addition of 
histidine into chiral aziridine 9 to forge the NC39 bond of 2. To 
mitigate the risk of imidazole eliminating from tyrosine to form the 
corresponding paraquinone methide (QM) (Figure 1, highlighted 
in red), bromide was chosen as a stable surrogate for hydroxyl group 
of the natural tyrosine with the intention to introduce the requisite 
phenol moiety at a late stage.
