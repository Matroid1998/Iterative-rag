Persistently low worldwide vaccination rates, the potential for breakthrough infections, and the ability for 
 vaccinated individuals to achieve viral loads sufficient to infect others 4 , suggest that there remains ample scope 
 for a replicationinhibiting antiviral in the panoply of pandemicalleviating healthcare tools. Natural products may present a potentially untapped source of antiviral activity. Plants must resist viruses 
 whose constituent peptides are restricted to the same twenty proteogenic amino acids. Plant virus proteins 
 share similar fundamental constraints on protein secondary and tertiary structure as viruses with mammalian 
 hosts. Plants secondary metabolites are known particularly for plantprotection. Prevalent among the 
 secondary metabolites are polyphenols. One of the three primary polphyenol classes are flavonoids 5 .
