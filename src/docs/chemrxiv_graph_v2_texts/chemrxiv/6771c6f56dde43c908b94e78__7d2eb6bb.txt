Readily available compounds used in hydrocyanation reactions.

Text:
The nitrile moiety, a cornerstone of modern organic chemistry and material science, is integral 
to natural products, pharmaceuticals and synthetic intermediates due to its exceptional 
versatility and reactivity.16 It serves as a key synthetic handle for transformations into 
carboxylic acids, amines, and aldehydes, while also enhancing reactivity at neighboring sites 
of molecules.79 The hydrocyanation of readily available alkynes represents a straightforward

and atomeconomic approach for nitrile synthesis (Figure 1a).10 Conventionally, this reaction 
relies on transition metal (TM) based catalysts,1115 as TMfree hydrocyanation is typically 
restricted to activated alkynes.1619 In recent years, developing new strategies for alkyne 
hydrocyanation has attracted considerable attention,11,13 including methods employing HCN 
surrogates as a substitute for the highly toxic and volatile HCN.2028 However, a critical 
challenge that still remains underdeveloped is the control of regioselectivity in the HCN 
addition.
