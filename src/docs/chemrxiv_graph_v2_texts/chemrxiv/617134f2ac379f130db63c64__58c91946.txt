Description:
An inorganic friction modifier that adsorbs and decomposes to form low-friction lamellar molybdenum disulphide films on steel.

The adsorption and selfassembly of surfactants at solidliquid interfaces plays a key role in
a wide range of technological processes, from nanoparticle stabilisation to ore otation.1 In
tribology, the adsorption of polar lubricant additives from nonpolar base oils onto solid sur
faces is critical to their eective operation.2 For example, organic friction modiers (OFMs),
such as stearic acid (SA), adsorb and form thin (2 nm) selfassembled monolayers (SAMs)
on steel surfaces, which signicantly reduce friction and wear.3 Similarly, inorganic friction
modiers, such as molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC), adsorb and decompose to
form thin (1 nm), lowfriction lamellar molybdenum disulphide lms on steel.4 Moreover,
antiwear additives, such as zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), adsorb, form SAMs,5 and
decompose on steel surfaces to form thick (100 nm) protective tribolms, composed mostly
of metal phosphates.6
Modern lubricant formulations contain at least ten dierent types of additive dissolved in
a blend of base oils.7 Combinations of dierent additives often behave antagonistically, that
is the additive blend gives poorer performance than any of the individual additives alone at
equal concentration.8 Prominent examples of antagonistic lubricant additive combinations
include overbased calcium sulphonate detergents with ZDDP,9 succinimide dispersants with
ZDDP,10 and MoDTC with ester OFMs.11 Many of these antagonistic interactions are due
to competitive adsorption processes, whereby the most surfaceactive component occupies
the majority of surface sites and inhibits the action of the other additives.8 Therefore, it is
important to understand the relative adsorption strength of the various lubricant additives
from base oils on steel surfaces.
