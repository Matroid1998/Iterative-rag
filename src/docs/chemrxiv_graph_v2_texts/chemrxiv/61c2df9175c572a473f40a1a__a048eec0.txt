Description:
Demonstrates catalytic responses for anodic AOR.

Text:
Pt and Ptbased alloys have demonstrated catalytic responses for AOR1014. Katan and 
Galiotto evaluated Pt black for anodic AOR, where they observed the current efficiency of nearly 
100  for N2 production10. VidalIglesias et al. analyzed structure sensitivity of polycrystalline 
Pt12, where they found that Pt (100) facet showed strong NH3 oxidation peak at 0.57 VRHE, while 
relatively small oxidation peaks were observed at potentials higher than 0.8 VRHE and lower than 
0.6 VRHE for (110) and (111), respectively. To further improve the catalytic activity of Pt 
catalysts, Vitse et al. investigated bimetallic alloys of PtIr and PtRu,13 where they observed a
