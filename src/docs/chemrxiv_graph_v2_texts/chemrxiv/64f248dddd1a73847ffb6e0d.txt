Description:
A compound that fails to couple with RAE-acid 1ab under modern chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical conditions.

Text:
Decarboxylative cross coupling has seen increasing 
use for rapidly appending alkyl fragments to arenes of all types (Fig
ure 1B).1215 Whereas the scope of such couplings is broad when pri
mary and secondary acids and their redoxactive esters (RAEs) are 
employed, extending that reactivity to tertiary acids has been a vex
ing problem.1619 For instance, the simple coupling of RAEacid 1a
b with pyrimidine 2 fails under the most modern of conditions 
(chemical, photochemical, electrochemical), delivering at most 9 
yield.
