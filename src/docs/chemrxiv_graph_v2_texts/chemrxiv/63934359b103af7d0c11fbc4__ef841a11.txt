Description:
Bioisostere of 3,3disubstituted oxetanes.

Fourmembered rings can generally withstand practical appli
cations despite their stereoelectronic distortion. Recently, they 
have attracted particular attention in the field of drug discovery 
because of their conformational rigidity.1 In particular, oxetane 
and azetidine are known for their polarity, which arises from the 
heteroatoms, i.e., oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. Bioactive 
molecules designed to incorporate these motifs are expected to 
show high selectivity for target proteins, as well as other bene
ficial properties such as hydrophilicity, solubility, and meta
bolic stability. Notably, following the milestone study by Car
reira et al., who revealed that 3,3disubstituted oxetanes are bi
oisosteres of carbonyl or gemdimethyl groups, the construction 
and metabolism of the oxetane motif have been extensively ex
plored (Figure 1A).2 Stepan et al.
