Description:
A perovskite system analyzed in MD simulations.

Text:
In the following sections, we present a comprehensive analysis of the MD simulations conducted for each sys
tem studied in the TEA challenge. These systems include two biomolecular systems (Alanine tetrapeptide and
Nacetylphenylalanylpentaalanyllysine), a 1,8Naphthyridinegraphene interface, and a Methylammonium Lead Io
dide perovskite. The starting point of each of the 12 MD trajectories simulated in each experiment can be found in
the Zenodo archive 10.5281zenodo.13832725.From their analyses, we extract key insights into the applicability and
reliability of MLFF models, and identify opportunities for further development and improvement. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024jhm5l ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000198536775 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
