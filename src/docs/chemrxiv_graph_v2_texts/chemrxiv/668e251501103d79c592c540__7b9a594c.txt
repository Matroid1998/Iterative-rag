Description:
Has lower solubility than C60, leading to dominant crystallization at the early stage of the growth process.

Geogenic minerals have been shaped in laboratory by following the synthetic strategies used by 
organisms.711 Curved and hierarchical morphologies can be formed by a gradient of the building 
block(s) supersaturation, templating of amorphous phases and confined crystallization.1214 Organic 
crystals having curved morphologies have been observed as well.1518 For example, Yamamoto et 
al. showed recently that planarchiral doubledecker molecules assemble into vesselshaped single 
crystals with curved concavity on quartz substrates.19 Choi and coworkers reported the formation 
of double and tripledecker flowers by crystallizing mixtures of C60 and C70 fullerenes.20 The 
crystallization of C70 is dominant at the early stage of the growth process due to its lower 
solubility, followed by cocrystallization of both C60 and C70 to form lateral petals.
