Description:
A polymer that, when combined with nanofillers, enhances elasticity and thermal properties.

Text:
1012 When MNP 
is used instead of MMT as a nanofiller, the polysaccharide coating on MNP not only offers 
stability, but also reduces the toxicity of bare MNP, allowing the formulation to reach the target 
directly.13 
The incorporation of nanofillers such as M MMT into the PEI results in a substantial 
improvement in the elasticity module, increased thermal resilience or greater fire retardancy 

factor. 1416 PEIs and macroscopic polymer such as, lignin greatly improve a range of 
physicochemical properties needed in new fields of application. (Figure 1). 1719
