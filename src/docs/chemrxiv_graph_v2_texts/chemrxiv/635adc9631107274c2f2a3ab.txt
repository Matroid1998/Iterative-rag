Description:
A material used in perovskite solar cells with a certified record efficiency of 17.06%.

Text:
CsPbI3 has been successfully used in PSC with several reports reaching a 
conversion efficiency exceeding 10  3035 and a certified record efficiency of 17.06 36. Even though the 
great success of cubic CsPbI3 this phase is thermodynamically unstable and spontaneously transforms 
into the yellow orthorhombic  phase, with no photovoltaic or optoelectronic properties at room 
temperature22,25. It has been proven, both theoretically and experimentally, that the  phase of CsPbI3 has 
superior structural stability properties when compared with other polymorphs37. In fact, several reports on 
high efficiency and stability cells, including a device with (uncertified) power conversion efficiency of 17.4 
 and a lifetime (estimated using high temperature accelerated degradation) of five years operating 
continuously at 35C, have been recently reported35,38,39.
