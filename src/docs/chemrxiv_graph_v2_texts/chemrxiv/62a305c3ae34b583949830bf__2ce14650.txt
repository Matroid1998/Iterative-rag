Description:
Intermediates formed after thermal homolysis of Bi(III) bearing bulky phenolates, potentially responsible for the formation of allyl radicals from propene.

1C).18 Examples of Bi REC are scarce, 
and the few reported homolysis cases of the BiX bond are 
mainly irreversible, due to the high reactivity of the ensuing Bi 
radical species.19 Fundamental studies on a BiMo catalyst for 
the SOHIO process conducted by Hanna suggested that Bi(II) 
intermediatesformed after thermal homolysis of the Bi(III) 
bearing bulky phenolatescould be responsible for the for
mation of allyl radicals from propene.19c Similar reactivity with 
bulky phenolate anions was later observed by Evans in a unique 
CH bismuthylation of phenols.19a In 2018, Coles demonstrated 
that the Bi(III)O bond in a R2BiOTEMP compound is in equi
librium with the corresponding R2Bi(II) and TEMPO.20 Col
lectively, these precedents pointed to a facile thermal BiO 
bond scission of bulky oxytype anions that can stabilize O cen
tered radicals.19d, g Yet, the origin and factors that influence this 
process still remain unclear and investigations on such unusual 
chemical properties would be desirable.

Description:
Coordinates with ammines and alcohols, leading to X-H bond weakening.

Text:
Herein we report on the 
synthesis, reactivity and structural characterization of a Bi REC, 
whose BiO homolyzes reversibly at room temperature without 
the need for irradiation (Fig. 1D). We demonstrate that such 
complex permits fast, and mild activation of ammonia and wa
teramong other alcohols and aminesresulting in wellde
fined Bi(III) amido and alkoxy compounds. We suggest that 
upon coordination to Bi(II), ammines and alcohols undergo X
H bond weakening, thus permitting their facile radical activa
tion. In addition, we propose that the novel pincerbased 
Bi(III)NR2 compounds show reactivity with a triad of H, H 
and H sources.
