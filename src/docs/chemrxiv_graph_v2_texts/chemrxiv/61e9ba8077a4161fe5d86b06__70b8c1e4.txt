The transition to a society based on renewable energy re
quires new ways to store electricity from intermittent energy
sources, e.g. in the form of chemical fuels. H2 is a convenient
fuel in this respect, as it can be produced by the electrolysis
of water.1 The eciency of this process is however limited
by the poor kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
at the anode.
