Description:
Contained within the framework structure of sulfonated ionic COFs as a single-ion conductor.

of these novel ionic COFs could markedly reduce the expense 
associated with such devices. This advantage, combined with their superior performance and 
stability, highlights the potential of iCOF1 materials in advancing the development of more 
affordable and sustainable energy storage solutions. This research introduces a groundbreaking class of singleion conductors sulfonated 
ionic COF containing Na or K ions within their framework structures (iCOF1 (Na) and i
COF1 (K)). These materials are designed to be solventfree and saltfree, positioning them as 
costeffective alternatives for energy storage applications.
