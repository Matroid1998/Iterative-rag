Description:
Monomers used in the synthesis of polyurethanes.

Text:
Within a few decades, polyurethanes have emerged as a 
powerful class of organic polymers. These materials possess a 
wide range of industrial applications,1 ranging from foams to 
CASE (Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants and Elastomers), owing 
from the increasing array of polyol and polyisocyanate 
monomers available. Until very recently, polyurethane 
materials 
were 
synthesized 
from 
petrochemicalbased 
compounds with high toxicity. However, with the growing 
concerns regarding raw material origin and resource scarcity in 
the upcoming decades,2 the design of monomer based on 
renewable sources is becoming a need.
