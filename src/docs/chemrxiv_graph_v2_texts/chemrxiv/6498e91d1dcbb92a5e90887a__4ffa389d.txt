Description:
Can act as an aryl isostere with reduced planarity.

In 
these cases, 1,3substituted cyclobutane linker can act as an aryl 
isosteres with reduced planarity; flexible ethyl or propyllinkers 
can also be replaced by conformationally restricted 1,3
disubstituted cyclobutanes to limit the number of possible 
conformations.1b Despite the importance of these cyclobutanes, 
catalytic methods for their synthesis remained relatively less 
explored in parallel with their homologues.57 Moreover, 
diastereocontrolled 
synthesis 
of 
1,1,3trisubstituted 
cyclobutanes featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters 
remains challenging.7 
In recent years, strainrelease driven transformations have 
recaptured significant attention in synthetic organic chemistry,8 
materials science,9 analytical chemistry10 and bioconjugation.11 
As the smallest of fused carbocycles, bicyclo1.1.0butanes 
(BCBs) are highly strained (ring strain energy 66 kcal mol1) yet 
benchstable, synthetically versatile carbocycles.12 The release 
of ring tension embedded in BCBs, coupled with the character 
for the central CC bond, allows for the design or discovery of 
new reactions for the synthesis of ring systems.13 Among them, 
ringopening reactions via homo or heterolysis of the spring
loaded CC bond represent powerful tools enabling quick and 
efficient access to multisubstituted cyclobutane derivatives.
