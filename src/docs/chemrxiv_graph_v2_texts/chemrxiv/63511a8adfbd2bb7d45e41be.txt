Precursors of various heterocycles such as furans, thiophenes, and pyrroles.

The development of synthetic methodologies to produce 1,4diketones is a wellstudied 
area of research,13 in large part due to their utility as precursors of various heterocycles 
such as furans,4 thiophenes,5 and pyrroles.6 While a number of disconnections are 
possible, perhaps the most commonly used synthetic strategy follows the umpolung 
approach of disconnecting the 1,4diketone into a nucleophilic acyl group equivalent 
and an ,unsaturated ketone, such as employed in the Stetter reaction.1 The Stetter 
reaction uses substoichiometric amounts of an Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) in the 
presence of an aldehyde and an ,unsaturated ketone to furnish the desired 1,4
diketones via a nucleophilic Breslow intermediate. Another possible disconnection 
would involve generating the 1,4diketone from three distinct fragments.
