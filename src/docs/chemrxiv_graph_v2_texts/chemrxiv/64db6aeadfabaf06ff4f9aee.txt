Description:
A phase that can be easily recovered at ambient conditions.

Text:
This problem has been solved in 
the case of nanocrystalline diamond,5 boron nitride,6 and stishovite,7 i.e., in the cases where the phases 
can be easily recovered at ambient conditions, one only need to optimize the tpT conditions of direct 
solidstate phase transformations in order to ensure nanostructuring of a highpressure phase. However, 
in the case of zinc oxide, this approach has not worked so far, and synthesis of pure rsZnO remains a 
major challenge, as does understanding of the properties of rsZnObased materials (nanocomposites, 
solid solutions with transition metals, etc.
