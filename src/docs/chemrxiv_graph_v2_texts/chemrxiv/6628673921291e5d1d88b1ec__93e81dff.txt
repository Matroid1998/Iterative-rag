Description:
A typical carbon material known as fullerene.

Text:
Graphene and C60 fullerene are 
recognized as two of the most typical carbon materials, which have had a great impact 
on the development of chemistry and materials.30,31 Recently, Chen et al. performed 
the interaction of C18 with graphene by periodic and nonperiodic calculations.32 The 
nature of the interaction between C18 and graphene was found to be essentially the 
same as that between monomers in C18 dimer, but all components of the high order 
symmetryadapted perturbation theory (SAPT) in C18graphene complex are about 
three times as large as those in C18 dimer, indicating that the intermolecular interaction
