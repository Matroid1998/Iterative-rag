Description:
Modified forms can be accepted by enzymes to enhance aptamer affinity.

SELEX starts with a large library of oligonucleotides (up 
to 1014 sequences),21 followed by rounds of selection consisting on separating binders from non
binders, followed by PCRbased amplification,1 followed up with sequencing.22 Although thousands of 
aptamers targeting a broad range of targets have been generated by SELEX, outstanding aptamers 
that can be reliably used in biomedical and analytical applications are still limited because there are 
gaps in their performance including their specificity and affinity.23 To overcome these hurdles, 
researchers have been investigating methods to create aptamers using larger library sizes and with 
more complex structures.24 Nonnatural modifications of nucleic acids are known to enhance aptamer 
affinity,25 and can be discovered by using enzymes which will accept modified nucleotide 
triphosphates (dNTPs), however this results in uniform modification  for example, with all uridines 
displaying a cubane appendage26  since information on variations of modification at the same type 
of base would be lost in PCR amplification.
