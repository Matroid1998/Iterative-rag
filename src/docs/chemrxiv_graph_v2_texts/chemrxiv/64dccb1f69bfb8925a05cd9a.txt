Description:
An atom of dioxygen (O2) is selectively inserted into CH bonds by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Text:
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are hemethiolate 
monooxygenases that catalyse the selective insertion of one 
atom of dioxygen (O2) into CH bonds. This enables them to 
catalyse a wide variety of complex transformations includ
ing epoxidation, heteroatom oxidation, desaturation, 
dealkylations, and CC bond cleavage and formation.1 The 
sequence identity between and substrates of P450s from 
different families and species can vary widely but their 
overall structures are broadly conserved. Their spectro
scopic properties are similar due to the heme catalytic cen
tre.2, 3 Much of our knowledge of these enzymes is derived 
from the first structurally characterised cytochrome P450, 
P450cam, a stereoselective camphor hydroxylating enzyme 
from a Pseudomonas bacterium.
