Description:
Promising thermoelectric materials due to their high temperature chemical and structural stability, relatively high Seebeck coefficient, and intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity.

Text:
Thermoelectric (TE) materials utilize the Seebeck effect for solid
state conversion of heat to electricity.1 The figure of merit (zT)
is a measure of the TE performance of a material and is given
by zT  2Ttot, where , , tot and T are the Seebeck co
efficient, electrical conductivity, total thermal conductivity, and
temperature, respectively. tot is the sum of the electronic and
lattice (phonon) contributions (tot  el  lat). Layered oxy
chalcogenides are promising TE materials24 due to their high
temperature chemical and structural stability, relatively high See
beck coefficient, and intrinsically low lat.5 ptype BiCuSeO, is
a wellknown midtemperature TE material,6 with zT reaching a
maximum of 1.5 at 873 K.7,8 We need both ptype and ntype legs
to build a TE device.
