FIG. 1. A schematic representation of the GED experiment. An
example of a raw GED image of vitamin K3 (molecular structure
shown in the same figure) was taken from Ref.1. Gas electron diffraction (GED) is a powerful experimental
technique for obtaining accurate structures of molecules.2,3
Developed in the 1930s,2,4,5 over the years, this technique
has allowed the establishment of many important concepts of
structural chemistry2,57 and also determining accurate struc
tures of various molecular systems.2,811 In the 19801990s,
