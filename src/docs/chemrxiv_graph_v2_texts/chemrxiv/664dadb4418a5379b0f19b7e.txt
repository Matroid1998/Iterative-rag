Demonstrates notable antibacterial effects.

Text:
Several metals, such as silver or copper, 
have demonstrated notable antibacterial effects, opening new avenues for combating microbial 
infections. 59 In addition, combinations of various metals in nanomaterials present numerous 
advantages compared to nanoparticles consisting of a single metal. These advantages include 
improved properties, leading to synergistic effects and customized features, multifunctionality, 
stability, costeffectiveness, and the potential for novel applications. 1013 
Indeed, bimetallic nanoparticles have been able to inhibit bacterial growth through the 
following mechanisms i) Adhesion to the cell membrane altering its structure, permeability 
and deficiencies in cell functions such as ATP secretion and transport activity. ii) Penetration 
into the cell and nucleus by disrupting mitochondrial function, destabilise and denature proteins, 
ribosomes and DNA interaction.
