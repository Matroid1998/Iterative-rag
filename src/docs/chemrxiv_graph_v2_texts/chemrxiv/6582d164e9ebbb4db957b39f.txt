Description:
Forms clusters such as Zr6 and Zr12 in metal-organic frameworks.

Text:
For example, the 
combination of benzene1,4dicarboxylate (BDC) with Zr4 can result in the fcu 
topology UiO66, connected by Zr6 clusters;15 a related polymorph with hex topology;16 
an hcp analogue connected by Zr12 clusters (Figure 1a);17 and MIL140A, which has 
an infinite onedimensional chain secondary building unit (SBU).18 Isolation of 2D 
phases 
can 
be 
achieved 
through 
conversion 

either 
spontaneous 
or 
mechanochemically induced  of the hcp phase materials into layered, hxl topology 
MOFs (Figure 1b) that can be exfoliated into hns topology nanosheets (limited 
examples can be prepared directly).19,20 This means that the preponderance of Zr 
MONs reported with linear dicarboxylates contain Zr12 clusters. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20236j4w1 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000204087647 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
