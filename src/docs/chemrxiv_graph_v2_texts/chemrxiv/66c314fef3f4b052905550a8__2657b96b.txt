Description:
Deposited on graphene through area-selective methods after surface activation.

Text:
Selectivity can be enhanced using 
surface functionalization by selfassembled monolayers,17 electron beam irradiation,18 UV 
exposure,19 oxygen plasma treatment,20 or by growing lateral superlattices.21 
Recently, we proposed a way to overcome the chemical inertness of graphene to ALD precursors 
by locally activating the surface using direct femtosecond laser (fslaser) twophoton oxidation 
(TPO) for areaselective ZnO deposition.22 This method photochemically attaches oxygen
containing groups to graphene by exposing it to ultrafast laser pulses under an ambient 
atmosphere.23 As a result, hydroxyl and epoxy groups form on the graphene surface with 
moderate laser exposure, while carbonyl and carboxyl groups appear at higher irradiation doses, 
closer to the ablation threshold.24 TPO provides precise control over the oxidation level of 
graphene and enables the patterning of complex structures with high spatial resolution (300 
nm), with the potential to achieve 20 nm resolution using tipenhanced techniques.25 
Additionally, this is a simple, resistfree ultrafast direct laser writing (UDLW) method,26 and 
the oxidized graphene surface can be restored to its initial state through thermal annealing in an 
inert atmosphere.22
