Description:
Used as a solvent and activates sulfoxide to a sulfonium cation.

In these reactions, 
the 
Spmethoxybenzyl

Sacetamidomethyl 
cysteine 
sulfoxide 
(Cys(MBzl)(O) 
or 
Cys(Acm)(O))11,12 moieties are converted to the corresponding Schlorocysteine under acidic 
conditions using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as solvent in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride 
(GnHCl) or diisopropylamine hydrochloride (DAHCl). The resulting electrophilic species 
participate in aromatic electrophilic substitution (SEAr) reactions with indole to achieve the CH 
sulfenylation of the Trp (Figure 1).12 Here, GnHCl or DAHCl is indispensable for the reaction, 
because they function as cation scavengers (amine part) and chloride anion source. TFA activates the 
sulfoxide to a sulfonium cation and assists in liberating the protecting group (P) as a cation from the 
resulting sulfonium intermediate. The use of sulfoxide enables the oxidantfreeacidmediated
