Description:
Derived from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin following photoconversion by UVB solar radiation.

Text:
Despite the historic success of vitamin D fortification programs to prevent nutritional rickets in 
childhood 1, 2, subclinical vitamin D deficiency (VDD) remains a global health concern given 
its important skeletal and extraskeletal functions, including immunomodulation and inflammation 
regulation 3. The primary source of vitamin D is vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) derived from 7
dehydrocholesterol in the skin following its photoconversion by UVB solar radiation 4. Genetic 
polymorphisms and certain dietary sources (e.g., oily fish, fortified milk, supplements) also 
contribute to overall vitamin D status 5 that is modified by latitude, skin pigmentation, age and 
various lifestyle and cultural factors that influence sun exposure 6, 7.

Description:
Metabolized in the liver to form 25hydroxyvitamin D3.

Text:
Vitamin D3 is metabolized 
in the liver to form 25hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3 or calcifediol), the major circulating form 
of vitamin D, which is mainly bound to the vitamin D binding protein prior to its bioactivation to 
form 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) 8. Vitamin D status is typically assessed based on 
measuring the total circulating concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the sum of 25
OHD3 together with minor levels of 25hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) derived from the dietary
