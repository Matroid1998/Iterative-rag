Description:
A synthetic, two-dimensional material composed of alternating nitrogen and boron atoms.

Text:
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a synthetic, twodimensional material that is isoelectric to 
graphene13 but composed of alternating nitrogen and boron atoms rather than carbon atoms. It 
was first prepared in the 1840s by WH Balmain through a reaction incorporating molten boric acid 
and potassium cyanide. However, it was not until the 1950s that the synthesis of hBN was made 
more practical to address industrial needs.
