Description:
A fuel that can be produced using renewable energy in power-to-X systems.

Text:
If the energy 
source is purely fossil fuels, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is reported to cause more 
emissions than unabated fossil fuels.46 To address this challenge, it has been proposed to apply 
renewable energy to power the carbon utilization, thus forming powertoX (power refers to 
solar or wind renewable energy source; X refer to fuels or chemicals, such as methanol, H2, 
gasoline and polymers).4, 5, 713 However, it is complex to immediately scale up these systems 
due to two facts (1) a prerequisite is the access to cheap renewable energy, which requires a 
considerably higher renewable power capacity than todays installations for solar 
photovoltaics14 and wind turbines; (2) the intermittent renewable electricity requires either 
cheap battery systems or the feasibility for dynamic operation of the utilization processes.8, 11 
Further, several studies on hybrid systems, i.e.
