However, CNT membranes are also susceptible to environmental degradation, such 
as plasma induced damage, chemical degradation, or microbial growth which can compromise 
their performance and durability, especially in harsh environments.13,14,15 Degradation can lead 
to a changes in the effective pore size, or changes to other properties of the membrane.13,15 
One possible way to protect CNTs from external damage and improve their performance is to 
coat various materials onto CNTs that can enhance their durability and functionality in harsh 
environments.13,14,16,17 For example, costing with metal oxides such as TiO2, Al2O3, ZnO, or 
NiCoO2 onto CNTs can enhance their antifouling and antioxidation capabilities, as well as 
impart photocatalytic, hydrophobic or electrochemical properties.18,19,20,21,22,23 Depositing 
polymer layers can modify the electrical and thermoelectric properties, and it also holds promise 
for biotechnological applications.24,25,26 Deposition of nanomaterials, such as graphene, gold, 
nanodiamond, or fullerene, can enhance the photoelectrical, electrical, thermal, and mechanical 
properties of CNTs, and enable new applications, such as sensors, electromagnetic shields, 
electrodes, or electrochemical material.27,28,29,30 
Although capping or surface modification of CNTs with thin films or nanoparticles of various 
materials has been proposed to protect and functionalize CNTs, depositing materials uniformly 
around CNTs in a freestanding membrane structure is challenging due to their highly complex 
3D morphology.
