Description:
Shows anomalous fluorescence from its second singlet excited state (S2) instead of the more generally observed fluorescence from the lowest singlet excited state (S1).

A corollary of this rule, i.e., the Kasha
Vavilov rule, states that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of 
exciting radiation.3 However, there are exceptions to both the Kashas and the KashaVavilovs 
rules.4 The first exception was reported for the azulene molecule (see 1a in Scheme 1), which 
shows anomalous fluorescence from its second singlet excited state (S2) instead of the more 
generally observed Kashalike fluorescence from the lowest singlet excited state (S1).5,6 Since then, 
many other molecular entities have been reported to behave in an antiKasha manner.
