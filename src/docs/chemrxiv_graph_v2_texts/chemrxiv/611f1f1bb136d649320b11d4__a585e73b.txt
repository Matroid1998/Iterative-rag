Description:
Grafted with polyethylenimine as a heterogeneous catalyst for condensation reactions.

Text:
Ethyl phenylcyanoacrylates were noted in variety of reports 17. Thus, liquid compositions 
containing cyanoacrylates were investigated for endovascular embolization in treating 
aneurysm, artery and venous malformation 1 and in synthesis of heteroaryl compounds as 
sodium channel blockers 2. Cadmium and mercury complexes with ethyl 3phenyl2
cyanoacrylate were studied 3. Synthetic applications include use of zirconium potassium 
phosphate and methyl phosphonatesas heterogeneous catalysts in synthesis of the acrylates

via Knoevenagel condensation under solvent free conditions 4, direct access to 
multifunctionalized norcamphor scaffolds by asymmetric organocatalytic DielsAlder 
reactions 5, strongly basic polymersupported catalyst with guanidine groups 6, silica 
grafted polyethylenimine as heterogeneous catalyst for condensation reactions 7. Of 
interest is also study of neuroleptic activity and dopamineuptake inhibition in 1piperazino
3phenylindans 8.
