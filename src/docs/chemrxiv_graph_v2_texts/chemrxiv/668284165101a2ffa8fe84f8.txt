Description:
Conjugation with polyethylene glycol, cholesterol, or proteins reduces rapid kidney clearance and enhances pharmacokinetics.

The functionalization of biopolymers with a variety of payloads is a common and wellestablished 
strategy to alter their properties, enabling numerous applications such as detection, drug 
delivery or the immobilization of biological compounds.1,2 This technique is particularly used in 
the oligonucleotide field, as the conjugation of oligonucleotide with polyethylene glycol (PEG), 
cholesterol or proteins is an effective way to reduce the rapid kidney clearance of 
oligonucleotides and enhance their pharmacokinetics properties.3,4 A common way to improve 
the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to their site of 
action is their bioconjugation to Nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), peptides (in case of cell 
targeting or cell penetration) or even antibodies.5,6 Antibodies properties can themselves be 
improved by means of bioconjugation.
