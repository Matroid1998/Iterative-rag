Nanoscale drug delivery systems offer greater therapeutic efficacy for many diseases, 
35 
particularly cancer treatment, due to numerous advantages Nanoscale particle size, the ability 
36 
to deliver the drug molecules to the target tissue at the desired dose, the ability to release the 
37 
drug in the target tissue for the desired time, and thus reduce the systemic side effects of drugs. 38 
For these reasons, they represent the most promising treatment approach. With this approach, 
39 
many nanosized drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, 
40 
nanostructured lipid carriers, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, polymerdrug 
41 
conjugates, dendrimers, and carbon nanotubes, have been developed to deliver therapeutic 
42 
agents to the desired site more efficiently and effectively.
