Description:
Directly incorporated into polymer chains.

Text:
The polythioamides 
were applied in precious metal recovery with selective 
coordination of metal ions. More noteworthy, Pd2 ions were 
directly incorporated into polymer chains, resulting in PdII
crosslinked singlechain nanoparticles (SCNPs),35 which were 
applied as a recyclable homogeneous catalyst for various 
catalytic reactions, demonstrating promising applications of these 
polythioamides.
