Text:
In electrocatalysis, they have demonstrated 
considerable potential for application in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution 
reaction 4, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and 
nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) 1. Additionally, SACs have been employed in methane 
conversion, CO oxidation, biomass conversion, and the degradation of environmental pollutants 
9. The high catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs render them especially appealing for the 
production of clean hydrogen through water splitting, particularly in alkaline environments 10. The catalytic mechanisms operating at single metal sites remain inadequately understood 14. This lack of clarity complicates the rational design of new SACs and reliance on trialanderror 
methods prolongs the development process.

Description:
Involved in adsorption and desorption processes affecting reaction kinetics and catalytic performance.

Text:
The specifics surrounding the interactions at the active 
sites are critical to improving their efficiency and discovering methods to stabilize these catalysts 
under operational conditions. A clearer understanding of the system perturbation can provide 
better insights to the reaction mechanism. This is our major focus here. SACs are known to exhibit sensitivity to alterations in the reaction environment, encompassing 
parameters such as temperature, pressure, and electrolyte composition. 15 Variations in these 
parameters have been observed to exert an influence on the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen 
and other reactants on the active sites, consequently resulting in alterations to the overall reaction 
kinetics and catalytic performance.

Description:
Involved in catalytic hydrogen evolution, where catalysts reduce the high activation energy barrier.

Text:
While the potential of SACs for hydrogen evolution is substantial, it is imperative to confront 
the challenges pertaining to environmental sensitivity to facilitate the advancement of these 
catalysts in the realm of renewable energy technologies. 16 In this study, we undertake a 
thermodynamic examination of a novel highdensity fish patch singleatom catalyst for HER. 2.0 HER and Thermodynamic 
Thermodynamic considerations play a crucial role in the field of catalytic hydrogen evolution, 
influencing both catalyst design and reaction efficiency. The activation energy barrier for hydrogen 
evolution is generally high, necessitating the use of catalysts to reduce this energy threshold 17.

universal linear correlation observed between the kinetic exchange current density in hydrogen evolution 
reaction and the thermodynamic adsorption energy of hydrogen atoms over various catalysts 17.
