Description:
A layered ferroelectric with an anomalous negative piezoelectric coefficient.

Text:
However, very recently
an anomalous negative piezoelectric coe cient has been
observed in the layered ferroelectric CuInP2S6 6, which
is explained in terms of its large negative eelc
ij that is not
overcome by positive eion
ij . Also, negative piezoelectric
coe cients  due to their large negative eelc
ij  have been
observed in several hexagonal ABC ferroelectrics8. This
raises an interesting question can a negative total eij
be obtained due to large negative eion
ij ? To answer this
question, we investigate three intrinsically piezoelectric
monolayers, 1HMoS2, 1HVS2 and 1HLaBr2 and we dis
cover 1HLaBr2 as a new 2D piezoelectric monolayer that
has a negative piezoelectric coe cient originating from
a large negative eion
ij .
