Description:
Used in the synthesis of the western fragment by addition into aziridine.

Text:
The synthesis of the western fragment 
3 branched tryptophanasparagine motif (Figure 1, highlighted in 
green) was envisioned in the same fashion by addition of 2methyl 
furan into the corresponding aziridine 7. In this case, furan acts as 
an epimerizationproof synthetic precursor to the primary 
asparagine amide, to be unveiled towards the end of the synthesis. With a strategy in hand to address the challenge of synthesizing the 
bbranched amino acids 6 and 7, our attention next turned to 
construction of the two macrocycles and final assembly of 2. The synthesis of 2 is outlined in Scheme 1.

Description:
Used as a nucleophile onto aziridine and as a masked primary amide to avoid side reactions.

Text:
After screening a variety 
of activation reagents, the combination of PyAOP with HOAt was 
found to be the most effective conditions under which to forge the 
macrocycle to yield 4 in 54 yield over two steps. The aziridinebased strategy outlined above could be leveraged 
again to forge the tryptophanasparagine linkage. Thus, western 
fragment 3 was prepared by employing 2methyl furan as a 
nucleophile onto aziridine 7. The use of 2methylfuran as a masked 
primary amide provided several advantages, notably avoiding 
undesired side reactions such as epimerization of the bcarbon and 
imide formation during carboxylic acid activation.
