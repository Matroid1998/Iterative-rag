Description:
A complex organic molecule observed in molecular clouds.

Text:
The variety of molecules observed
includes complex organic molecules such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, methanol,
vinyl alcohol, ethylene oxide, ethenone 914 and many more1521. Molecular clouds
are characterized by low temperatures and contain icy grain mantles. They also have
relatively high densities in comparison to the general conditions in the diffuse inter
stellar medium (ISM)8, 22. Despite the rich chemistry occurring in molecular clouds,
the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for molecular formation in such cold
dilute areas are still not understood. In the cold cloud cores, icy grains are the major reservoir of molecules as a result of
the short freezeout time scale.
