Description:
A material that can be structured into foams, which are a type of functional porous material.

Text:
Investigation of functional porous materials (FPMs) is an everlasting topic standing at the cutting 
edge of materials science, because combined porous structures and versatile compositions of 
FPMs warrant their remarkable performance in widespread fields. (1) Foams, which are equal to 
aerogels in certain cases, are one type of widely studied FPMs. They feature macroscopically 
monolithic structures favorable for handling and additional applications, and can be structured 
from nearly any unit ranging from silica, nanocarbons, polymers, twodimensional (2D) materials, 
to inorganic nanocrystals. (26) As a rising star in the foam family, noble metal structured foams 
(NMFs) raised tremendous interest upon their debut. (79) Imparting threedimensional (3D) gel
