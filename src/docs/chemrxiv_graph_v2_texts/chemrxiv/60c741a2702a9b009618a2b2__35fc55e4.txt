Description:
Produced from carboxylic acids and amines with water as the only stoichiometric byproduct in catalytic direct amidation reactions.

Text:
The direct amidation reaction between carboxylic acids and amines is one of the most common processes 
employed in the synthesis of organic molecules in both academic and industrial organisations. It remains a 
highly inefficient reaction, however, due to the widespread use of stoichiometric activating agents that leads 
to the generation of high molecular weight byproducts as well as increased solvent use during both workup 
and purification.1 There has consequently been considerable interest in recent years in the development of 
catalytic direct amidation reactions which enable amides to be produced from carboxylic acids and amines 
with a molecule of water as the only stoichiometric byproduct.
