based on dilute ammonium fluoride solutions has also been used to tune the thickness of oriented
mesoporous silica films. 18 However, dry etching methods require expensive instruments and
highselectivity masking materials. Masking materials such as chromium (Cr) 19, photoresists,
polysilicon, amorphous silicon, aluminum, silicon nitride, and chromiumgold (CrAu) 20 have
been reported for the etching of silica. These are typically patterned on the substrate using standard
lithography techniques. Metalpolymeric nanoparticles (NPs) could replace these masking materials
for the etching process. A combination of solidstate dewetting and annealing of thin metallic films
on the silica surfaces resulted in the deposition of different metal NPs which acts as an etchant
mask.

Super hydrophilic transparent nanopillar structures on silica have been fabricated via the
combination of nanosphere lithography and plasma etching which has been shown to prevent
bacterial growth on the surfaces. 24 Silicon nanostructures were fabricated through metalassisted
etching in which a thin layer of metal such as Au, Ag, Cu, and Pt, deposited on the Si surface,
catalyzed the etching of Si in various mixtures of hydrofluoric acid (HF)oxidantsolvent. 2528
Expensive requirements such as vacuum, plasma generation, or ion optics are inevitable in dry
etching and sidewall damage is an undesirable effect associated with it. 26 Therefore, wet chemical
etching is considered a less expensive method to fabricate surface structures at higher etch rates on
planes of different orientations.
