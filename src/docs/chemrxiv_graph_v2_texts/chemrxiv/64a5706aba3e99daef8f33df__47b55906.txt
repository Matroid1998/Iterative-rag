Description:
Has a strong affinity to nickel, enhancing technological applications.

Text:
It is noticed that the effect of the second metal will improved the performance
Nickel based catalyst materials, it will subsequently increase the reactivity and avoid the deactivation of the
designed Nibased catalyst under the studied catalytic reactions. therefore, the strong affinity of Ni to cobalt,
copper,zinc, and many other transition metals. Thus, award to it very sophisticated advantages in various
technological applications. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the recent advances on nickelbased multifunctional
