Products of 22 cycloadditions with alkenes in photooxidations.

Modern sustainability criteria in chemical synthesis have spurred the development of energy and 
resourceconservative methodologies. Photooxygenations, which rely exclusively on abundant 
oxygen and visible light irradiation, have gained tremendous attention as one of the most atom
economic and sustainable reactions. Among the wide diversity of photooxidations, 22
cycloadditions and the Schenck ene reaction use alkenes to provide 1,2dioxetanes and allyl 
hydroperoxides, respectively. Both these reactions are endowed with a perfect atom economy and 
yield versatile synthetic precursors and chemical biology tools (Figure 1).

Description:
Strained heterocycles important for bioanalytical and diagnostic applications as functional subunits of chemiluminescent probes.

1,2Dioxetanes are strained 
heterocycles with an increasing importance for bioanalytical and diagnostic applications as functional 
subunits of chemiluminescent probes.1,2 Similarly, allyl hydroperoxides are useful precursors to 
functionalized C3 units including natural products and drugs.3 
Both reactions are promoted by singlet oxygen (1O2) that is formed via dyesensitized photoexcitation 
of triplet oxygen (3O2).4 1O2 is an attractive reactive oxygen species and it has been used for the 
synthesis of natural products, fragrances and drugs.5,6 Photochemical singlet oxygenations can be 
problematic under conventional batch conditions. Especially at large scale, light penetration remains 
superficial and the presence of an oxygenrich headspace in the presence of flammable organic 
solvents rises significant safety issues.
