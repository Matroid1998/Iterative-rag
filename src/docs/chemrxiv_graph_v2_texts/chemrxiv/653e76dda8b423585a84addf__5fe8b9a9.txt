Description:
A polar covalent compound with significant charge transfer from boron to nitrogen.

216), and these compounds can be considered 
as a single series in which there is a gradual change of chemical bonding from the covalent type to 
the ionocovalent type, while the bonding energy is virtually determined by the first tetrahedral 
coordination sphere. For IIIV compounds of light elements, while zbBN is characterized by a large band gap 
(Eg  6.36(3) eV 5), a value three times smaller is reported for zbBP Eg  2.1 eV 6. In fact, 
boron nitride is polar covalent with significant charge transfer from B to N as opposed to BP where 
less charge transfer is expected. The difference in behavior has a chemical origin derived from the 
electronegativity () values according to Pauling B 2.04; N  3.04 with (BN)  1.
