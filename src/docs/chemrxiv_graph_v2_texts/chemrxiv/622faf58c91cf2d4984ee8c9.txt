Description:
Synthesized on an automated synthesizer and purified using reversed-phase or ion-exchange HPLC.

Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) synthesized on an automated synthesizer are 
usually purified using reversedphase (RP) or ionexchange HPLC. Their purity is also 
usually determined using HPLC. For both preparative and analytical HPLC, the elution 
profile is mostly generated using a UVVis detector with the wavelength set to 260 nm. Quantities of ODNs are typically documented using optical density at 260 nm, which is 
abbreviated as OD260. It is defined as the UV absorbance at 260 nm (A260) of the ODN to 
be quantified dissolved in 1 mL of water with a light path of 1 centimetre. The value of 
OD260 is usually determined separately after an ODN is purified by HPLC using an UV 
spectrometer or other UV based apparatus such as a NanoDrop.
