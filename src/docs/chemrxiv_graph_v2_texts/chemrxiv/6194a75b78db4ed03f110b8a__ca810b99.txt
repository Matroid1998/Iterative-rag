Description:
Enhances oxygen evolution and reduction reactions due to their multiple oxidation states and role in water oxidation.

Text:
In search for concepts to develop the next generation of
batteries with comparable or even superior performances
than existing devices, zincair batteries (ZABs) belong
to the most promising approaches 13. However, in
spite of the many advantageous features, one of the basic
problems for its use is the slow kinetics of oxygen evo
lution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) on the
air cathodes 1. In recent years, many eorts have been
devoted to solve this problem by nding new electrocat
alysts with suciently high activities to promote both
reactions 2, 49. Manganese and cobalt oxides are natural candidates
to enhance OER and ORR because of their role in the
water oxidation in many biological systems, their multi
ple oxidation states, natural abundance, and inexpensive
costs 6, 1012.

Description:
Surface Co ions are proposed as the active site for OER, with oxidation state changes during the reaction.

Besides, as in the case of other transition
metal oxides 13, their catalytic activity can be enhanced
by doping or by introducing oxygen vacancies. In recent studies of OER reaction mechanisms on
cobalt oxides, surface Co ions have been proposed as the
active site for OER 1416. According to these propos
als, the oxidation state of cobalt increases during OER. As a result, the density and oxidation state of surface
cobalt ions are critical for OERORR activity. When
these reactions are catalyzed by manganese or cobalt
oxides or (oxy)hydroxides, it involves oxidation states
from 2 to 4, with the cation species M3 being the
main active center 1517.
