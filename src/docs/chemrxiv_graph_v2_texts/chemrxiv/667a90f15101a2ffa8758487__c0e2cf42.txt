Description:
Complex molecules formed through quenching by water in terpene synthesis.

Text:
Quenching by water to give specific, complex terpene alcohols requires a 
high level of molecular choreography in order to make water available whilst avoiding premature 
quenching of reactive intermediates, since the presence of trapped water is likely ubiquitous 
within the closed active site conformation.2225 Numerous studies have shown that 
(sesqui)terpene synthases are highly promiscuous in nature and slight changes in the active site 
pocket could lead to drastic changes in the product distribution, including formation of 
hydroxylated sesquiterpenes.2530 Engineering of sesquiterpene synthases to create novel and 
highfidelity enzymes supports the establishment of biotechnological processes for 
manufacturing of highly valuable sesquiterpenoids.20,3133 However, predictive engineering of 
these enzymes to make specific products remains a major challenge.
