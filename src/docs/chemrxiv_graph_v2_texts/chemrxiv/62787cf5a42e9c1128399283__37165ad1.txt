Description:
An oxide thermoelectric with ZT exceeding unity.

Text:
Indeed, several ptype
oxides with ZT exceeding unity have been discovered since 1997, when NaCo2O4 showed promise as an oxide
thermoelectric.4 NaxCoO2 and Ca3Co4O9 are currently some of the best ternary ptype thermoelectrics, with ZT
exceeding 1 at 800 K and 1.1 at 1000 K, respectively.5,6 Mixedanion materials have also proven to be successful,
with ptype oxide BiCuOSe exhibiting a high ZT of 1.4 at 923 K.7 Recently, two oxypnictogens LaZnOP and
LaZnOAs were predicted to have theoretical maximum ptype ZT scores of 2.10 and 1.92, respectively, at
