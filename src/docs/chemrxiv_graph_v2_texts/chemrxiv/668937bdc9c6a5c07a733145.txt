Description:
Heteroanionic materials containing anions with similar X-ray or neutron scattering factors.

In
stead, these methods yield only an effective unit cell
where each anion site is occupied by a statistical average
of the constituent anion species. Shortrange structural
information can be obtained from scattering experiments
in the form of pairdistribution function (PDF) data 14. However, for heteroanionic materials containing anions
with similar Xray or neutron scattering factors, such as
oxyfluorides, it is often not possible to assign anion site
occupations based solely on PDF data, and alternative
methods must be used to resolve the anionic structure of
these materials. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20248dfgqv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000230568233 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
