Description:
Utilized in catalytic systems.

Text:
Common catalytic systems include those 
based around boronic acids,2 boric acid derivatives3 or boron heterocycles,4 as well as salts of the group(IV) 
metals titanium, zirconium or hafnium.5 However, to date these catalytic amidation methods have failed to 
become widely adopted.6 This is partly due to the fact that they cannot often be applied to common amide 
targets which incorporate polar functional groups such as heterocyclic rings.
