Description:
A key factor in the carbon intensity of transportation affecting GHG emissions.

Text:
The reduction of CO2 emissions in the society cannot prescind from a drastic reduction of 
the emissions caused by transportation. Currently, in the European Union (EU), the 
transportation activities (passenger cars and goods transportation) cause more than 20  of the 
total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 1. This makes the reduction of the carbon intensity of 
transportation a key factor to reach the netzero GHG emissions. The electrification of 
transportation is envisaged as the most promising option for the reduction of such emissions 
and several countries declared the intention to phaseout combustion engine vehicles 2. This 
will mainly be achieved by using battery electric vehicles (BEV).

Description:
A chemical element that is not emitted directly during the oxidation cycle in fuel cell electrical vehicles.

Text:
Additionally, fuel cell 
electrical vehicles (FCEV) can be considered an alternative, as they do not cause any direct 
carbon emission during the oxidation cycle that produces electricity. This latter technology is 
of particular interest for heavy duty vehicles 3. Several studies discussed in literature the 
environmental impact of BEV; most of them concluded that these vehicles originate lower 
GHG emissions over their entire lifecycle than equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles 
49. However, this assumption is only valid if the source of electricity or H2 is accompanied 
by a low carbon footprint 10. As the main sources of renewable energy are affected by intrinsic stochastic availability, 
the sustainability of electrified mobility hangs substantially on the energy supply.
