Description:
Involved in the Mitsunobu reaction and in the total synthesis of (dl)-morphine.

Text:
Ring trisubstituted, 3bromo4ethoxy5methoxyphenyl 2methoxyethyl 
phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in biochemical evaluation studies of cellactive 
inhibitor of the cancerpromoting phosphatases of regenerating liver 1, and in dataset of 
log P measurements for benchmarking studies 2. 3Bromo4,5dimethoxyphenyl ring 
substituted PCA is mentioned in studies of 4aryl2oxo2Hchromenes as a new series of 
apoptosis inducers using a cell and caspasebased highthroughput screening assay 3, and 
in preparation of substituted coumarins and quinolinones as caspase activators for treatment 
of cancer 4. Another ring substituted PCA, 2bromo3ethenyl6methoxyphenol is 
involved in the Mitsunobu reaction 5; in studies culminating in the total synthesis of (dl)
morphine 6, and in tandem intramolecular conjugate additionintramolecular alkylation 
reactions of substituted vinyl sulfones 7.
