Description:
An all-carboatomic molecule belonging to the family of carbon allotropes.

What makes this macrocycle 
especially intriguing is that its two loops can each accommodate a molecule, such as 
fullerene C60 or C70, through noncovalent interactions to form a dualguest 
supramolecular complex, which has been confirmed by Xray crystallographic 
analyses of its synthetic experimental group. Cyclo18carbon (C18) is another form of nanoring prepared and characterized by 
Kaiser and coworkers in 2019.15,16 It is an allcarboatomic molecule belonging to 
the family of carbon allotrope together with pure carbon materials such as fullerenes. In the past two years, various theoretical studies involving the properties,1728 
behaviors,2933 and potential applications3437 of C18 and its analogues and 
derivatives have been carried out by several research groups. Among these, the 
theoretical design of supramolecular complex by Jiang et al.
