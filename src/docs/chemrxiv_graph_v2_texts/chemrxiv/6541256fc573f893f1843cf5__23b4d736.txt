Description:
A cobalt-free blue ceramic pigment with low toxicity and thermal stability.

The discovery of novel blue ceramic pigments has attracted significant interest, since 
currently, some of the most used commercial pigments contain cobalt, e.g. cobalt aluminate 
spinel (CoAl2O4) and cobalt (II) stannate (Co2SnO4) 15. Due to the toxicity, limited resources 
of cobalt raw materials and their increasing use in energy materials, new cheap, durable, and 
low toxicity blue pigments that avoid the use of cobalt are needed 67. Recent research on YIn1xMnxO3 has illustrated the potential to prepare cobaltfree blue 
ceramic pigments with the colour due to Mn3 in trigonal bipyramidal coordination in this 
compound 813. The vivid blue colour, low toxicity, and thermal stability have led to this 
pigment being recently approved for commercial use.
