expanded this work by showing that 1 can also be formed using Na and K metals as reducing agents in 
1,2 dimethoxy ethane (DME),31 and that the spectra obtained with potassium was comparable to Geske 
electrochemical data. Continuing with the use of metals as reducing agents, Ling and Gendell first reported 
the formation of contact ion pairs 1X (X  Li, Na, K, Cs) in DME,32 where the HFCs to the nuclear 
spins of the alkali metals (I32 for 7Li, 23Na and 39K, I72 for 133Cs) were resolved. They found sizeable 
variations of all HFCs with temperature and a combination of separated and contact ion pairs in mixed 
solutions of DME and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
