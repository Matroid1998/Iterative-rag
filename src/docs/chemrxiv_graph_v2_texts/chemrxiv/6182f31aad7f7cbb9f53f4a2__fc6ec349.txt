Description:
An atmospheric contaminant that affects the performance of nonaqueous lithium-air batteries.

Text:
Furthermore, the catalysts used in nonaqueous lithiumair batteries are sensitive 
to atmospheric contaminants such as water and CO2. Some have proposed to enclose a metalair 
battery in a sealed pressure vessel to mitigate the contaminant problem. However, in this case the 
energy density is significantly limited and may not be competitive compared to even current 
lithiumion batteries 3. With such a large array of problems associated with room temperature metalair batteries, 
interest has increased in elevated temperature metalair batteries. For example, lithiumair 
batteries have been reported to function at temperatures of 100C using a molten nitrate 
electrolyte 45.
