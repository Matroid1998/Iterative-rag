Description:
A high-performance n-type Zintl pnictide thermoelectric material with ZT 1.51 at 716 K.

Text:
While most Zintl pnictides are known to show ptype polarity, 
the recent development of highperformance ntype Mg3Sb2based 
thermoelectric materials, which exhibit ZT  1.51 at 716 K,13,14 has 
encouraged further identification of ntype Zintl pnictides. However, fabricating ntype Zintl pnictides is not an easy task 
because most of the ntype doping is compensated by the socalled 
killer defects, such as cation vacancy.22 In addition to Mg3Sb2based 
materials, ABX4,23,24 Eu5xLaxIn2.2Sb6,25 Eu3InAs3,26 and Ba3Cd2P427 
have been reported as ntype Zintl pnictides so far. The crystal structure of Zintl arsenide Eu5In2As6 belongs to the 
orthorhombic space group Pbam, as shown in Figure 1.28,29 Each In 
atom is fourfold coordinated by As atoms to form InAs4 tetrahedra, 
which are cornershared along the c axis.
