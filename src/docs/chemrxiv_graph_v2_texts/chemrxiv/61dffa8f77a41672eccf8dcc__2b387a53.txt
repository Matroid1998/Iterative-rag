Description:
Used in catalytic amounts for multicomponent reactions involving dicarbofunctionalisation.

Text:
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs), wherein three compounds 
intermolecularly combine in a sequential manner, are revealed 
as ideal strategies in diversityoriented synthesis. The formation 
of two new vicinal carboncarbon bonds by addition of two 
different reagents across terminal and internal olefins is one of 
the most challenging multicomponent reactions. This type of 
dicarbofunctionalisation sequence provides 1,2substituted 
alkanes, principally with the aid of catalytic amounts of Pd, Cu 
or Ni complexes.1 The intrinsic sequences along the catalytic 
cycles, with the mentioned transition metal complexes, involves 
the formation of undesired byproducts, due to the cross 
coupling between both reagents or Hecktype products 
formation, as a consequence of inherent Helimination 
pathways. These drawbacks limit the application of this method 
to essentially C(sp2) or C(sp) hybridised reagents, R1X and R2Y, 
(Scheme 1A).
