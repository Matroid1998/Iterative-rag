Description:
Inorganic compounds accessible through colloidal nanocrystal synthesis.

Text:
Since its early days,1 the research on colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) has provided access to a variety of 
inorganic compounds, spanning from metals and alloys2 to oxides,3,4 phosphides,5 chalcogenides,611 hal
ides12,13 and more. Nowadays, NCs are exploited in many different fields, as NCsbased products are 
steadily finding their way to commercial applications.1418 A colloidal approach to the synthesis of inor
ganic materials offers several advantages over more traditional solidstate chemistry techniques, such as 
milder reaction conditions, ease of tunability deriving from a wider choice of precursors, better processa
bility of the products, and straightforward access to nanostructured materials. However, both this flexibil
ity and the push toward materials combining a higher number of elements come at the cost of increased 
complexity.
