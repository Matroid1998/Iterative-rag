Description:
Used in hydrogen fuel cells where the oxygen reduction reaction is current-limiting.

Text:
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial biological process and a critical component of
developing technologies such as metalair batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. For hydrogen fuel
cells, the ORR is currentlimiting, and cathodes generally contain platinum catalysts to produce
the current needed for industrial applications.1 The broader commercialization of these devices
relies on developing catalysts that are cheap, abundant, and active relative to the current state of
the art. Computational studies aid the design of novel catalysts in part by defining the factors that limit
theoretical catalyst activity.
