Description:
A gas that can be stored using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

The ability of MOFs to 
capture and release gases efficiently is a critical factor in their design and deployment, particularly 
for industrial and environmental applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.13 
Computational simulations have become an invaluable tool for predicting the performance of 
MOFs, offering insights that aid the optimization of their gas adsorption and desorption 
properties.14,15 

Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations have been widely utilized for 
simulating and predicting gas uptake, diffusion, and selectivity in different MOFs.1618 The 
outcomes of GCMC simulations depend heavily on the force field used to model the interatomic 
interactions.19 Adsorption and desorption properties of MOFs are often determined by the strength 
and specificity of the interactions between the MOF and the gas molecules, which can vary 
significantly depending on the MOF structure and the nature of the gas molecules.20,21 Therefore, 
precise force fields designed for specific adsorbates are crucial for achieving reliable GCMC 
simulations that can effectively capture the MOFgas molecule interactions.
