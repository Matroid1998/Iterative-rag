Description:
A monolayer with excellent chemical and physical properties due to its unique puckered geometry.

Interestingly, several studies
show that penta2D monolayer exhibits excellent chemical
and physical properties, some of them are even better
than hexagonal monolayer counterparts due to their unique
puckered geometry. For example, pentaCN2 exhibits higher
energy density and greater inplane stiffness than the hBN
monolayer 10. Realizing the fact that there can be more degrees of
freedom for physical and chemical properties, very recently,
a new ternary pentagonal prototype, composed of B, N, and
C atoms, pentagonal boron nitrogen carbide (pBCN), has
been theoretically predicted, which is mechanically, ther
mally, and dynamically stable direct bandgap semiconduc
tor with excellent piezoelectric response 16.
