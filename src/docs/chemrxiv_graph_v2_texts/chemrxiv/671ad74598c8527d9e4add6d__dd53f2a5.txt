Description:
Used in sodium-ion batteries as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to its superior raw material abundance and significantly lower cost.

The scalable adoption of batteries for decarbonization and energy accessibility requires
addressing current challenges including 1) high cost, 2) unethical and environmentally unfriendly
mining practices, 3) dependence on critical minerals and their supply chains, and 4) unsafe
battery chemistries. These issues can be addressed in part through the careful design of electrode
materials. Sodiumion batteries (NIBs) offer a promising alternative to lithiumion batteries
(LIBs) for grid storage or electric vehicle applications due to their superior raw material
abundance, significantly lower cost (up to half in terms of kWh), and ease of scalable
production using existing Liion battery manufacturing methods and infrastructure.16 To be a
competitive technology alongside these excellent attributes, the energy densities of cathode
materials must be comparable with those of LIBs.
