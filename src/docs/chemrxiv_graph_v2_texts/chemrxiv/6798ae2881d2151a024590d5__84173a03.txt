Description:
A widely used motif in medicinal chemistry.

Leveraging computational
tools and machine learning frameworks, combined with
efficient semiautomated synthesis techniques such as
highthroughput experimentation (HTE) and latestage
functionalization (LSF), improves cycle times while re
ducing material consumption and costs 5, 6. LSF facilitates the direct substitution of CH bonds by
other functional groups or building blocks in a single
step, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization of
complex molecules 7. Consequently, this approach
can offer higher efficiency in diversifying hit and lead
structures compared to the traditional multistep syn
thesis starting from basic building blocks 8. Among
the available LSF methodologies, 9 Miniscitype C
H alkylations are of particular interest as they lever
age readily available carboxylic acids to incorporate
alkyl fragments into heterocyclic cores 10, such as the
widely used pyridine motif in medicinal chemistry.
