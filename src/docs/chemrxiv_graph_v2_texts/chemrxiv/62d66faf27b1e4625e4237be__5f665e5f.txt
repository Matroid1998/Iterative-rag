Description:
Less active than tris(4methoxyphenyl)phosphine in converting poor and intermediate Michael acceptors.

In such cases, a Lewis base catalyst 
might be the better choice. Commonly used 
Lewis 
base 
catalysts 
are 
tertiary 
phosphines,3,12 amines like 4dimethylamino
pyridine13 and Nhetereocyclic carbenes.14 
Highly reactive nucleophiles such as trialkyl
phosphines or NHCs often suffer from poor air 
and moisture stability or require a strong base 
to be formed from their precursors. Therefore, the quest for an air and moisture insensitive Lewis base 
catalyst with high activity is ongoing. Recently, we have reported a step towards this direction by showing 
that the electron rich tris(4methoxyphenyl)phosphine (TMPP, Fig. 1) is more active in converting poor and 
intermediate Michael acceptors than triphenylphosphine (TPP).15 Regrettably, the improvement in activity 
was not that pronounced that TMPP could rival the performance of phosphazene bases.
