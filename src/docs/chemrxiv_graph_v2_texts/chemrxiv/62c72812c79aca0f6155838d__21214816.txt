Description:
Used as a protective group in the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides.

Most recently, Meiers research group at NCI used the cyanoethyloxycarbonyl (Ceoc) group and a 
photocleavable linker for the synthesis of ORNs containing the sensitive ac4C function.14 Deprotection 
and cleavage were achieved under nonnucleophilic conditions in three steps consisting base treatment, 
fluoride treatment and photo irradiation. The work constitutes a significant progress in the field. However, 
many challenges remain. The longest ORN reported was a 15mer along with several 10mer ORNs. The 
guanosine nucleotide was incorporated with a phosphoramidite without amino protection, which requires 
careful control of coupling conditions to avoid Nphosphitylation.
