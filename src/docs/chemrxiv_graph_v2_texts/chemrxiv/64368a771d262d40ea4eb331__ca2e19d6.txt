Description:
Used in the reduction of Au oxide.

The lat
ter phenomenon refers to a plasma that forms
in a gas sheath around the working electrode
at high voltages.2325 In both cases, the volt
ages can reach several hundreds of volts and
the current densities are in the range of 1 to
10 Acm2.2628 Advantages of this high voltage
(current density) approach are that the prepa
ration times are significantly shorter and only
an (alkaline) electrolyte is required.27 Further
more, we demonstrated that the final structure
of the NPG film depends on the method used to
reduce the Au oxide, i.e., electrochemically or
in the presence of H2O2.27 For long electrolysis
times, it is even possible to form a NPG film
insitu in a single step.27
To further tune the formation of the NPG
film, it is beneficial to understand both the
growth and the interaction of the Au oxide films
as well as the NPG films with the Au substrate.
