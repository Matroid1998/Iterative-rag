Cement production is responsible for about 8 of the global greenhousegas emissions 1. Despite important 
32 
technological advancements in the production of Portland cement clinker, which led to significant reductions 
33 
of the emissions in the last decades, it is impossible to reduce the emissions to zero. This is because a substan

tial part of the emissions are geogenic, i.e. they originate from thermal decomposition of limestone which is
