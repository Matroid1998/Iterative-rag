Description:
The origin of the word aromaticity that conforms perfectly to the HÃ¼ckel's (4n + 2) electrons rule.

Text:
The aromaticity of cyclic molecules is one of the most frequently mentioned 
properties in modern organic chemistry, and numerous studies have long been 
conducted on it.1,2 Aromaticity is not a property that can be observed experimentally, 
and there is no strict physical definition.3 Chemists commonly explore molecular 
aromaticity through a variety of indicators proposed based on different physical ideas 
or empirical rules. Electron counting rules were first used to assign aromaticity 
character in  conjugated systems, the most important being Hckels rule which 
suggests that planar molecules with (4n  2)4n electrons are aromaticantiaromatic. Benzene (C6H6) is the origin of the word aromaticity that conforms perfectly to the 
Hckels (4n  2) electrons rule.
