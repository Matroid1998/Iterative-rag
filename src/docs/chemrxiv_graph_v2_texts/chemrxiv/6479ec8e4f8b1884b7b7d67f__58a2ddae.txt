Description:
A transition metal catalyst used in reversible-deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) systems.

Airtolerant ATRP
methods, most of which are based on activator re
generation, have been developed (initially for solution
ATRP, and later adapted to surfaceinitiated ATRP)
by the Matyjaszewski group 16, 17, 21. ATRP is a reversibledeactivation radical polymer
ization (RDRP, also called controlled radical poly
merization) system in which the equilibrium between
propagating and dormant chain ends is mediated by
transfer of a halide to a transition metal catalyst (usu
ally copper) 15, 22. The mechanism by which oxy
gen interferes with ATRP is by oxidising the Cu(I)
