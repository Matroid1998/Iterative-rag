Description:
Divalent anions that form part of the BX64 octahedra in halide perovskites.

Twodimensional (2D) halide perovskites (HPs) have become an emerging semiconductor 
platform because of their intriguing optoelectronic features originating from the distinctive 
structurescompositions as well as synthetic feasibility. The large organic cations, called 
spacers, confine the inorganic lattice  a BX64 octahedra (B and X are divalent metal cations 
and halides, respectively) as a unit cell  into a monolayer thickness as a RuddlesdenPopper 
(RP) structure (chemical formula of L2BX4)1. The distinctive organicinorganic hybrid structure, 
where the organic cations serve as a dielectric barrier, renders a quantumwell electronic 
structure manifesting in sharp and strong excitonic emissions that are not observed in 3D HP 
counterparts1, 2. The feasibility of synthesizing 2D HPs via solution processing at low 
temperatures presents significant advantages compared to conventional 2D materials that 
require energyconsuming synthetic conditions3, 4.
