Description:
Low electron scattering and electronically conductive material.

Text:
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful analytical tool for 
characterizing nanomaterials at the atomic level.13 TEM can also be used in combination with 
other TEM related techniques such as diffraction, to solve crystal structures, and electron 
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), to determine bonding and oxidation states.4 For the imaging 
of nanomaterials, a TEM grid coated with a continuous or partial thin film of an electron beam 
transparent material is often used. Thin films (3  30 nm) of carbon floated over a support 
substrate are particularly popular due to carbon being low electron scattering and electronically 
conductive. Here the carbon is typically an amorphous carbon film, although graphene oxide5 
and graphene6 layers have also been used.

Description:
Frequently used as the nanostructured electrocatalyst support for electrocatalytically active nanoparticles due to its low cost, electrical conductivity, and reduced electrocatalytic activity.

Text:
In electrocatalytic energy conversion applications carbon is also frequently used as the 
nanostructured electrocatalyst support for electrocatalytically active nanoparticles (NPs). The 
carbon, typically a carbon black, can take a variety of structures, which range in the ratio of 
sp2 to sp3 bonded carbon and the level of graphitization.7 Such carbons are used due to their 
low cost, electrical conductivity and reduced electrocatalytic activity towards the energy 
conversion processes of interest.8 To assess NP structure pre and post electrocatalysis, either 
the NPs or the NPs plus carbon black support, can be placed on the carbon TEM grid.9,10 
Outside of energy applications, carbon film TEM grids have also found used in the elucidation 
of electrochemically driven NP deposition mechanisms.11,12
