Description:
Requires a controlled release system to achieve a pulsatile release profile for prolonged therapeutic effect.

Text:
Many of these systems seek to control drug 
concentrations by providing a continuous and prolonged release of a therapeutic while 
reducing the dosing frequency, fluctuations in plasma levels and adverse sideeffects 
12. Successful sustained delivery systems have been developed for a range of 
different peptides (e.g. Lupron Depot and Bydureon BCise) by encapsulation into 
polymeric microparticles. To date, most conventional controlled release systems 
release therapeutics in a continuous, passive manner as a function of water imbibition 
and the extent of polymer degradation 12,13. To achieve a prolonged therapeutic effect with teriparatide, a controlled release system 
must achieve a pulsatile release profile. Stimuliresponsive materials are of interest in 
drug delivery 14. These materials can respond to endogenous or exogenous triggers 
leading to a property change in the material, e.g.
