Description:
A copper-based chiral metal halide extensively investigated for its properties.

Chiral metal halides are triggering a huge interest for their potential use in different 
applicative areas such as chiroptoelectronics and spintronics due to their peculiar non
linear optical and spindependent properties.13 In addition, their intrinsic non
centrosymmetric structure may be exploited in ferroelectric and piezoelectric devices.4 
Lead represents the most common metal employed in the synthesis of chiral metal 
halides with RSMBA2PbI4 (MBAmethylbenzylammonium), reported by Billing in 
2006 and deeply investigated for its chiroptical response in 2017, representing a sort of 
archetypal composition in this field.5,6 The need of getting rid of toxic lead has prompted 
the search of alternative metals, and several leadfree chiral metal halides including Sn, 
Mn, Ge, Co, Bi and Cu, have been prepared in the last years showing intriguing 
properties induced by the nature of central metal.712 Among the listed elements, copper
based systems have attracted considerable interest, with (RSMBA)2CuCl4 being object 
of extensive investigation.
