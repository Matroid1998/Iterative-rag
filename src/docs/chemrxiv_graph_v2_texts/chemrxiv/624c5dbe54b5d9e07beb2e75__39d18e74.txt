Description:
A bulky Lewis base used in dehydrogenation reactions.

Text:
Miller 
and 
Bercaw 
showed 
that 
AB 
is 
dehydrogenated successfully by the combination of a bulky Lewis 
base (P(tBu)3) and a bulky Lewis acid (B(C6F5)3).10 Furthermore, in 
a recent DFT based work done by our group, it has been inferred that 
triarylboranes with a moderate hydride affinity are expected to be the 
most effective in the dehydrogenation procedure.11 However, the 
regeneration of AB from dehydrogenated products; borazine, 
polyborazylene (PBZ) has become a stumbling block for the practical 
implementation of AB as a chemical hydrogen storage material.
