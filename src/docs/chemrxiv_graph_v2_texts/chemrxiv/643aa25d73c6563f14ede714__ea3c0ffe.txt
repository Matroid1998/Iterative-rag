The successful exfoliation of graphene from graphite and the sub
sequent discovery of its unique chemical, physical, and electronic prop
erties have attracted much attention to 2Dlayered materials 19, 20. One of the particularly promising areas of their application is gas sens
ing due to their atomic thinlayered structure and large surfacetovolume
ratio. Although graphene shows excellent gassensing capabilities, its
application in gas sensors is limited by its zeroband gap resulting in
poor switching characteristics 21. However, other 2Dlayered mate
rials, such as transitionmetaldichalcogenide (TMD) sheets, possess
a sizeable band gap and thus are free of this inherent limitation of
graphene 1921.
