Description:
A clean energy carrier produced through the reduction of protons in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Text:
Photocatalysts 1 are materials that facilitate photoreactions under light irradiation, typically by 
absorbing photons and generating electronhole pairs that drive chemical transformations 2. These materials are integral to various applications, including water splitting, carbon dioxide 
reduction, and environmental remediation. In the context of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 
photocatalysts absorb light and utilize the energy to drive the reduction of protons to hydrogen, a 
clean energy carrier. The efficiency of photocatalysts in HER is heavily influenced by their 
electronic structure, light absorption properties, and charge transfer capabilities 3. Therefore, 
enhancing these properties through modifications, such as doping or structural design, has become 
a focal point for improving the performance of photocatalytic materials. One approach to improving photocatalytic activity is through nitrogen doping.

Description:
A clean fuel produced via water splitting through photocatalysis.

Text:
As the demand for renewable energy sources rises, hydrogen, produced via 
water splitting through photocatalysis, is increasingly recognized as a clean fuel that can replace 
fossil fuels. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution offers a sustainable approach to hydrogen 
production, utilizing abundant resources such as sunlight and water, while generating no harmful 
emissions 10. Photocatalysts, therefore, hold the potential to revolutionize the energy sector by 
providing a method for efficient and environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Moreover, 
photocatalysts are also critical in addressing pressing environmental challenges, including the 
degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction, and wastewater treatment, further cementing their 
importance in future technologies. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025n5v68 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000830408433 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
