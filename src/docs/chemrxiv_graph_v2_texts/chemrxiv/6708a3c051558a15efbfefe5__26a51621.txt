Description:
Formed during the corrosion process as a result of electrochemical reactions.

According to the National Association of Corrosion Engineers 
(NACE), the cost of corrosion is projected to reach US 2.5 trillion, equivalent to 3.4 worlds 
GDP.5 Preventing and controlling corrosion, as well as developing advanced inhibitors and 
corrosionresistant materials, is essential for the sustainable use of these materials. Achieving 
this requires a thorough understanding of corrosion mechanisms at the molecular level.6 
The mechanism of the corrosion process is governed by electrochemical reactions in the 
presence of an electrolyte, leading to the formation of rust in the form of hydroxides and oxides.
