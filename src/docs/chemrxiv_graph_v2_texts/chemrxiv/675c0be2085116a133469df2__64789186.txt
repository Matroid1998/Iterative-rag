Description:
Their synthesis is challenging due to the poisoning effect of sulfur on many metal catalysts.

Indeed, only few examples exist for the biocatalytic synthesis of thiols and thioethers (Figure 
1C), most of which start from racemic compounds and employ (dynamic) kinetic resolutions.710 Their 
synthesis by chemical means, such as metal catalysis, is also challenging due to the poisoning effect of 
sulfur on many metal catalysts.11 Furthermore, the reactivity of thiols further complicates enantiocontrol 
due to uncatalyzed background reactivity. While some natural products contain chiral thiols and thioethers, the strategy for their synthesis 
in nature either relies on the asymmetric enzymatic synthesis of other functional groups (such as 
epoxides) followed by substitution, or the use of radical enzymes.12 These enzymes are typically very 
substrate specific, and thus do not appear promising as general biocatalysts in a synthetic organic 
chemistry context.

Description:
Chiral compounds generated from vinyl sulfides through enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer.

This light requirement 
comes with serious disadvantages, such as known photodegradation of the lightsensing 
chromophore,23,24 as well as lightpenetration during process scaleupintensification.25 
Remarkably, some EREDs do not require light to access single electron chemistries with 
bromoacetophenones, generating reactive acyl radicals that have been shown to react with styrenes.26 
In the case of prochiral styrenes, such as methyl styrene, the benzylic radical intermediate formed after 
radical addition to the double bond is terminated via a highly enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer 
(HAT) from the FMN cofactor; however, larger substituents than methyl or ethyl have been reported to 
give only traces of conversion.26 Inspired by this reaction, we envisaged that radical addition to prochiral 
vinyl sulfides followed by enantioselective HAT would generate chiral thioethers (Figure 1E).
