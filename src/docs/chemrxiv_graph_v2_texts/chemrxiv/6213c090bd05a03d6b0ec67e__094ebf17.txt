Description:
A class of molecules used for their Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE) properties, particularly in bioimaging and biosensing applications.

In parallel, we have recently reported on extended tetra
phenylethylene (TPE) derivatives  a class of molecules classi
cally used for their AggregationInduced Emission (AIE) prop
erties2325 in particular for bioimaging and biosensing applica
tions2631 that had been specifically designed to maximize the 
twophoton emission properties of their aggregates.32 In the 
course of this study, it turned out that, in spite of the excellent 
colloidal stability and excellent spectroscopic properties of the 
suspension obtained by nanoprecipitation of TTOMe, only lim
ited control over the assembly was achieved  as a result, mix
tures of large (d100 nm) and disperse nanoparticles were ob
tained with detrimental outcome on the longterm survival of 
the imaged zebrafish.
