Description:
Modifiers or fluxes that result in the breakage of the continuous network structure of pure oxide glasses.

Text:
Hybrid glasses are typically made by meltquenching or ballmilling a specific crystal and 
thus restricted to stoichiometric compositions. On the other hand, the compositions of oxide 
glasses can be continuously adjusted through the addition of socalled modifiers or fluxes (e.g., 
alkali oxides), which result in the breakage of the continuous network structure of the pure
