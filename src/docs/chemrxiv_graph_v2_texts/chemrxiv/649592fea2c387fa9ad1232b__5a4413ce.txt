able to activate dihydrogen at mild temperatures, a transformation long thought to be exclusive 
to precious transition metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium (e.g. A) or ruthenium.3 This 
transitionmetal like behavior is enabled by the availability of an energetically high lying lone 
pair in a nonbonding orbital and a lowlying vacant orbital at the group 14 element, a feature 
reminiscent of the often partially filled dorbitals of the transition metals.
