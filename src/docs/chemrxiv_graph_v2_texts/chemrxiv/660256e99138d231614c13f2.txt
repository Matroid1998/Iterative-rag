Description:
Porous materials whose solid state structures can be analyzed using NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
Traditional NMR spectroscopy approaches provide structural information via 
8 
chemical shift analysis, and are regularly applied to inform the solid state structures of porous 
9 
materials, including oxides 13, 14, zeolites 15, 16, and porous coordination frameworks and 
10 
polymers (such as metalorganic and covalentorganic frameworks) 1719. However, for liquids 
11 
confined within the pore structures of such materials, chemical shift resolution is usually significantly 
12 
limited by linebroadening effects (especially for standard 1H NMR spectra, which typically exhibit 
13 
narrow chemical shift ranges), which occur due to local magnetic field distortions caused by magnetic 
14 
susceptibility differences at the solidliquid interface 20, 21.
