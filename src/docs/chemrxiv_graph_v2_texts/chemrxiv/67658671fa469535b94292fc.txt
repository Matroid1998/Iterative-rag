Description:
Inserted into the CH bonds of glycosidic linkages during oxidative cleavage by LPMOs.

Text:
The natural substrates of LPMOs are
different polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitin, starch and
pectin.1,2,5,9,10 Strikingly, the only structural motif that is strictly
conserved across all eight families is the activesite histidine
brace,13 which consists of two histidine residues that coordinate
a single copper atom. In most LPMOs, the histidine brace is
located on a flat and solventexposed surface that enables the
enzymes to be active on their polysaccharide substrates.14
LPMOs boost polysaccharide degradation by catalyzing the ox
idative cleavage of the different polysaccharides, by inserting an
oxygen atom into the CH bonds of the glycosidic linkages.
