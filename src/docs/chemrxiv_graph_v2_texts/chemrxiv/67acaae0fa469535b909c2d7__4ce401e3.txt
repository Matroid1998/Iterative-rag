Description:
Released during the conversion reaction of BiF3 in fluoride ion batteries.

Despite the common concern that large volume changes of CAMs observed for conversion
based phase transformation (recrystallization) lead to loss of contact and poor capacity 
retention upon cycling, the detailed phase transformations occurring upon chargedischarge 
processes are only little understood. In the case of BiF3, previous investigations on reaction 
mechanism were mostly carried out on LIBs (BiF3  3 Li  3 e  3 LiF  Bi) andor FIBs (BiF3 
 3 e  Bi  3 F) based on liquid electrolytes2025. Konishis group proposed that the poor 
cycling performance of BiF3 electrode in Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) could be attributed to 
insufficient discharge reactions as well as the production of Bi metal and organic electrolyte 
impeding surface charge reactions 22.
