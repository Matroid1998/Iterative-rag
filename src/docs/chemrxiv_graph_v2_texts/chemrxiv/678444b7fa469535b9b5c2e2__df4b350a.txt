Description:
A compound involved in reduction processes facilitated by photocatalysts.

Text:
As the demand for renewable energy sources rises, hydrogen, produced via 
water splitting through photocatalysis, is increasingly recognized as a clean fuel that can replace 
fossil fuels. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution offers a sustainable approach to hydrogen 
production, utilizing abundant resources such as sunlight and water, while generating no harmful 
emissions 10. Photocatalysts, therefore, hold the potential to revolutionize the energy sector by 
providing a method for efficient and environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Moreover, 
photocatalysts are also critical in addressing pressing environmental challenges, including the 
degradation of pollutants, CO2 reduction, and wastewater treatment, further cementing their 
importance in future technologies. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025n5v68 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000830408433 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
