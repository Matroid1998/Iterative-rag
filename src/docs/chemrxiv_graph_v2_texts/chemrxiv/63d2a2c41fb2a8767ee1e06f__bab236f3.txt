Description:
A high-voltage spinel cathode material with high energy density due to its high operating voltage.

Text:
Highvoltage spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) is a promising cobaltfree cathode material
which can deliver high energy density (650 W h kg1) due to its high operating voltage
4.7 V (vs LiLi) arising from the Ni2Ni4 couple.1 As an important derivative of the
extensively studied LiMn2O4 mixedvalence spinel (LMO), LMNO has structural and chem
ical similarities with LMO.24 In both structures Li occupy tetrahedral (Td) sites, and the
transition metals (TM) occupy octahedral (Oh) sites of the cubic closepacked oxygen arrays. In addition, they have 3D diffusion channels where Li migrate through gate sites six
member cation rings perpendicular to the diffusion path.5 LMNO, however, has improved
energy density and cycling stability compared to LMO partly due to a reduced prevalence
of Mn3 in LMNO.
