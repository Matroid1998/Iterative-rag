Description:
Vital compounds that T. gondii cannot synthesize and must import.

Text:
For survival, T. gondii is auxotrophic for numerous nutrients and has 
acquired salvage mechanisms to import the vital compounds that it cannot synthesize, as for example 
various metabolites including polyamines, cholesterol, purine derivatives and essential amino acids13. Chemotherapeutic targeting of the parasitic cell cycle and of the specific metabolic defects of T. gondii 
based on its auxotrophic nature was already explored (e.g., starving the parasite by nutrient depletion or 
disrupting the salvage pathways)1416.
