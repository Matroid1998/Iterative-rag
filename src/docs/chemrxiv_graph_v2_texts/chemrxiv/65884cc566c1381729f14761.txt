Description:
An amino acid with nonnatural side chains used to increase peptide stability in biological environments.

Text:
Considering that the shorter is a peptide 
sequence, the lower will be its cost and ease of production, dipeptides stand out as an attractive 
option, as demonstrated by the wellknown PhePhe motif,20 and variations thereof.2123 
Furthermore, the inclusion of nonproteogenic Denantiomers and amino acids with nonnatural 
side chains, such as norleucine (Nle), are attractive strategies to increase peptides stability in 
biological environments and to finetune their supramolecular behavior. In this work, we show 
that all possible combinations of Nle and Phe in dipeptides lead to hydrogels that are compatible
