Description:
Used as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but faces issues such as pulverization.

Text:
All these issues cause major problems for the 
performance and lifetime of LIBs using Si as anode. Some of these issues, such as the pulverization 
of the Si particles, can be solved through nanosizing 10, but much of the other problems that 
hinder the applicability of these anodes remain. Therefore, alternative strategies to incorporate Si 
in LIB anodes are currently being developed.
