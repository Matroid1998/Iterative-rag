Description:
A neutral electron-rich precursor used to produce stable diradical cations.

typical ), which gives rise to 
closedshell species or inflexible emission at ambient 
conditions.35,4345 Generally, the stabilization of cationic 
radicals requires an electronrich neutral nucleus to relax 
their reactive spots of electrondeficient radicals in a fully 
conjugated system via the TBC channel.4,46 In this 
condition, the substituent protection is also required in 
many cases.47 As a consequence, the stable diradical 
cations are exclusively produced from neutral electron
rich 
precursors (e.g., neutral polythiophene 
and 
polyarylamine backbones).
