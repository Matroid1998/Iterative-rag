Description:
A ubiquitous second messenger in Gramnegative Bacteria.

Text:
Cyclic dinucleotides are ubiquitous second messengers in Bacteria, however, the 
abundance of cyclic diGMP turnover proteins is still not reflected by the number of 
identified receptors 7. DRaCALA has been frequently used to identify receptors for 
cyclic dinucleotides, in particular cyclic diGMP and cyclic diAMP, which are 
ubiquitous second messengers in Gramnegative and Grampositive Bacteria 8, 9. Thereby lysates of bacterial libraries containing all plasmidexpressed gene products 
of an organism have been screened for cyclic dinucleotide binding proteins. With this 
experimental approach, receptors involved in, for example, regulation of cellulose 
biosynthesis such as BcsE and maintenance of osmohomeostasis and potassium 
transport have been identified 4, 10.
