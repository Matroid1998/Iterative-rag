Description:
A modified HF reagent known as Olah's reagent, highly toxic and corrosive.

Text:
HF is a corrosive gas and high 
concentrations can be fatal in contact with skin.13,14 Modified HF reagents, such as pyridinium 
poly(hydrogen fluoride) (Olahs reagent) or triethylamine tri(hydrogen fluoride) (TREATHF) have been 
widely adopted, and while not volatile like HF itself, they remain highly toxic and corrosive.8,15,16 
Furthermore, these types of fluorinating agents are exclusively derived from HF produced from 
acidification of fluorite (CaF2). There are concerns over the sustainability of such approaches.17,18 In 
the longterm, the fluorochemicals sector will need to resolve the twin issues of finite raw materials 
and the damage caused by release of fluorinated molecules into the environment.
