Description:
A mixed element in 2D perovskites with spectra dominated by subbandgap broadband emissions.

Considering these compatibilities, the substituting of Pb with Sn in MHPs could be a 
significant step forward in addressing health and environmental concerns associated with Pb
based alternatives17, and has led to extensive research aimed at developing environmentally 
friendly and sustainable MHP platforms18, 19. Interestingly, mixed PbSn 2D perovskites differ from their 3D counterparts as their spectra are 
dominated by subbandgap broadband emissions rather than bandedge emissions, which still 
the origin of them remains a topic of debate and uncertainty15. The broad emission in mixed Pb
Sn 2D MHPs could potentially be attributed to selftrapped excitons (STEs)2023 or structural 
defects of the material, the latter hypothesizing that excitons become confined within the defect
induced subbandgap trap states and undergo radiative relaxation by Stokes shifts20, 24, 25.
