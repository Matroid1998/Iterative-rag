Description:
Contains at least two epoxide groups that react with amine moieties for crosslinking.

Text:
This secondary amine can further react with another epoxy 
group to give a tertiary amine and another hydroxyl group. To obtain a sufficiently crosslinked 
resin, the epoxy prepolymer needs to contain at least two epoxide groups, which can react with at 
least two different amine moieties of the hardener. Scheme 1. Amine based curing reactions of epoxy resins. During curing, eventually, an amorphous molecular entity appears in the system, recognizable 
as an insoluble gel. It is suspended in the stillliquid part of the mixture, the sol, in which those 
polymers of lower molecular weights not yet attached to the gel are harbored.
