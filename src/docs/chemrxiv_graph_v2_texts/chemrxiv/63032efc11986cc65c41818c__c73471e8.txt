Description:
A metal-free cathode material with lower cost and higher redox potential compared to TEMPO.

Text:
Furthermore, the cathode in Liion battery is always metal oxide, the
production of Liion will consume precious metal resources. 1
Recently, research on organic radical batteries using TEMPO or NHPI as cathode has received a lot of attention. As a
cheap, abundant, nontoxic, less environmentally friendly material, TEMPO and NHPI are popular metalfree cathode
materials. There are many reports about using TEMPO as cathode active materials and got satisfied results.2 The
research about the appliance of NHPI in organic radical battery is rare, but compared with TEMPO, NHPI exhibits lower
cost and higher redox potential. Moreover, our team succeed in using NHPI as cathode material in a semiaqueous flow
battery.
