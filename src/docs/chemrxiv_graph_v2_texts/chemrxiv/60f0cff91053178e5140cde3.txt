Description:
A compound involved in reduction processes as part of sustainability efforts.

Text:
The push for global sustainability is ultimately linked to the electrification of the chemical industry 
as it shifts away from fossilfuel consuming thermochemical routes13. There is current a strong emphasis 
placed on water electrolysis and CO2 reduction, and as a direct result from these efforts these technologies 
are maturing to economic competitiveness47. Apart from this, electrochemical routes must also be 
developed to take advantage of abundant feedstocks, including methane8, biomass platforms9,10, and excess 
organics like acetonitrile, which is the focus of this work. Acetonitrile is typically generated as a byproduct 
in acrylonitrile production (produced at a scale of 5 million tons per year) and most of it is burned 
afterwards, generating NOx species in the process11.
