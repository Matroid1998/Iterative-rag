Description:
Involved in synthesis and radical copolymerization studies.

Text:
In continuation of our exploration of synthesis and radical copolymerization of esters 
2cyano3phenyl2propenoic acid, we have prepared alkyl ringsubstituted ethyl 2cyano
3phenyl2propenoates, RPhCHC(CN)CO2C2H5 (ECPP), where R is 2methyl, 3methyl, 
4methyl, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl, 1,1,1trifluoro4methyl, 1,1,1trifluoro2methyl, 
and explore the feasibility of their copolymerization with vinyl acetate. There are reports of 
syntheses of 2methyl, 3methyl, 4methyl 11, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl 12, 4
trifluoromethyl 13, and 2trifluoromethyl 14 ringsubstituted ECPP. To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no reports on copolymerization of these ethyl 2cyano3
phenyl2propenoates with vinyl acetate 15. 2 Experimental

2.1 Materials 
2Methyl, 3methyl, 4methyl, 4ethyl, 4isopropyl, 4tbutyl, 4trifluoromethyl, 2
trifluoromethyl  substituted benzaldehydes, propyl cyanoacetate, piperidine, vinyl acetate, 
1,1azobiscyclohexanecarbonitrile, (ABCN), and toluene supplied from SigmaAldrich 
Co., were used as received.
