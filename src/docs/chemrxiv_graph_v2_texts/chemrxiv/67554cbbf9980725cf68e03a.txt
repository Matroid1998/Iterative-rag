Description:
Forms bonds within racemic coassembled rippled sheets, contributing to the structure's stability.

Text:
We took inspiration from studies led by Schneider that reported racemic peptide assemblies 
with synergistic assembling behaviour leading to more rigid hydrogels, relative to each enantiomer 
alone.20 Subsequently, the same group demonstrated the molecular basis for such an effect, revealing 
that the two enantiomers were alternating in the coassembled rippled sheet,21 which is a structure 
that was predicted by Pauling and Corey in 1953.22 The racemic coassembly is held together by 
hydrogen bonds within the sheet, thus, creating nested hydrophobic interactions between enantiomers 
in the dry fibrils interior that do not occur in the case of enantiopure assemblies. We reasoned that the 
maximization of such hydrophobic regions could enhance hydrophobic substrate binding for catalysis.
