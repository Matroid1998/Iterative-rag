To 
overcome this challenge, an elegant indirect approach using arylthi
anthrenium salts as aryl radical precursors was introduced by Ritter 
and coworkers in 2019,11 and it has since been widely employed 
in twocomponent reactions.12 The air and benchstable arylthi
anthrenium salts can be derived from (hetero)arenes with excellent 
yield and site selectivity through electrophilic thianthrenation or a 
complementary Ircatalyzed regioselective borylation followed by 
Cumediated thianthrenation for latestage functionalization of 
complex bioactive molecules.11,12b More recently, Ritter and co
workers extended the application of this strategy to threecompo
nent reactions, enabling bromoarylation and aminoarylation of al
kenes through photoredox and copper dual catalysis.13 Despite 
these recent advances, the development of a unified synthetic plat
form capable of rapidly assembling diverse 1,2aryl heteroatomic
