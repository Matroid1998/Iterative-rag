Description:
Research focuses on new allotropes with ultrahigh hardness.

Text:
In recent years, significant efforts in the search for novel phases with advanced properties have 
benefited from structure prediction programs such as USPEX 1 and CALYPSO 2, and more 
recently from the crystallographic machine learning platform CrystalMELA 3. The topic of 
carbon research, especially regarding periodic structures, shows a sustained interest in the search 
for new allotropes, especially those characterized by ultrahigh hardness close to that of diamond. In view of the large number of carbon structures claimed as novel, a database SACADA 4 has 
been created to group all known carbon allotropes, thus helping researchers in their endeavors on 
the one hand, and avoiding claims of known phases as novel allotropes on the other.

Description:
Forms three-dimensional networks such as the body-centered tetragonal tetC4 with diamond-like topology.

Text:
Another avenue of investigation that could be complementary to modern materials science 
software lies in the crystal chemistry rationale called structural engineering. Recently, the 
bodycentered tetragonal tetC4 (Fig. 1a) in space group I4m2 was proposed by us as one of the 
simplest threedimensional (3D) carbon networks to serve as a template for the design of other 
novel allotropes and chemical compounds 5. Using the TopCryst crystallography package 6, 
tetC4 was identified with dia (i.e. diamondlike) topology. Several chemical compounds also 
have a dia topology, as categorized in the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource (RCSR) 
database 7. Recently, Wei et al. proposed a superhard tetC5 allotrope with mixed carbon hybridization (sp2 
and sp3) and metallic character based on structure prediction programs and firstprinciples 
calculations within DFT 8.
