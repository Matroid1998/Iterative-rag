Description:
Catalysts for HER with high catalytic activity, robustness, and stability.

Text:
In this context, 
metalloporphyrins have gained considerable attention as catalysts for HER due to numerous 
favourable properties such as high catalytic activity, robustness, characteristic absorption 
features, structural tunability and appreciable stability.12 Moreover, the accessibility of the  
and mesopositions in the ligand backbone enables systematic modification of the ligand 
framework by introducing different functional groups.13 Among the various metalloporphyrin 
catalysts studied for electrochemical HER, Nicontaining porphyrin complexes deserve special 
mention because of the pivotal role of Ni in the naturally occurring NiFe hydrogenase 
system.2,14 In this context, Nocera and coworkers investigated the effect of the secondary 
coordination sphere around the Ni(II) centre using Hangmantype porphyrins towards HER 
activity.
