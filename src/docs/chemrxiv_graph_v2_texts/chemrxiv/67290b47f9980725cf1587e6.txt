These removal 
solutions mainly rely on a liquid solvent or solid sorbent acting as the CO2 capture agent, which are amongst 
the most commercially mature material approaches.2 Traditional thermalswing adsorption methods, 
requiring (waste) heat for sorbent regeneration, have been a mainstay, but recent innovations are 
introducing novel techniques with potential energy efficiency improvements. For instance, recent research 
has leveraged the sublimation point of CO2 that forms a solid at 78.5 C in cryogenic DAC,36 using 
moisture to release the bound CO2 in moistureswing adsorption,79 and utilizing microwave, electric or 
electrochemical desorption of CO2 in electroswing adsorption.1015 While these novel techniques harbor
