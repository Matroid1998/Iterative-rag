Description:
Subject to oxidative etching in nanoparticle form.

Text:
The initial NPtoNP variations were attributed to variations in the number of undercoordinated 
reactive sites present on each NP surface, and the evolution over time to evolution of the NP 
surface under reaction conditions. The eventual transition to nearcomplete O2 inertness implies 
that the NPs evolved to have almost no undercoordinated surface sites, which was attributed to 
O2catalyzed isomerization to form fullycoordinated, fullerenelike surface layers. The ability to 
monitor structural evolution for individual NPs over time under reaction conditions is one of the 
strengths of the single NP mass spectrometry method. Here we apply this approach to Si NP 
oxidative etching.
