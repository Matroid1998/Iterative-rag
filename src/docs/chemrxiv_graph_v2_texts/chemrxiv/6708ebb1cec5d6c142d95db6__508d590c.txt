Description:
Representatives of late stages of lipid oxidation products.

Lipid oxidation limits the shelflife of lipidbased foods. The unsaturated fatty acids are
particularly prone to oxidation via free radical reactions, which results in, amongst others,
lipid hydroperoxides, hydroxides, ketones, aldehydes, and epoxides.1 In lipid oxidation
studies, these compound classes have traditionally been monitored by onedimensional
chemical methods,2 typically focusing on hydroperoxides and aldehydes as representatives
of early and late stages of lipid oxidation products, respectively. Furthermore, these
methods are laborious, and suffer from a low specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.35
These flaws limited the insight into which reactions are prevailing in complex foods, even
though lipid oxidation reaction mechanisms have been firmly established.1,6,7 This calls for
holistic foodomics methods8,9 that enable comprehensive mapping of lipid oxidation
products in a specific and quantitative fashion.
