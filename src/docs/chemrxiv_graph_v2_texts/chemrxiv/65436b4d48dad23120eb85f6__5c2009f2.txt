Description:
React with amines in the presence of H2 and triarylboranes for reductive alkylation.

Recent ad
vancements in cheminformaticsbased machine learning (ML) 
offer chemists a way to bypass traditional Edisonian empiricism 
and develop more efficient approaches to optimizing cata
lysts.14 Several groups have reported successful demonstra
tions of MLdriven optimizations of homogeneous catalysts 
such as phosphoric acids58 and Lewisbasic ligands for metal
based catalysts involving phosphines, Nheterocyclic carbenes, 
and nitrogenbased ligands.918 
Recent progress in frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs)19,20 has ex
panded the practical and sustainable application of maingroup 
catalysis, e.g., enabling the hydrogenation of unsaturated mole
cules without toxicprecious metals.2126 In this context, the 
maingroupcatalyzed reductive alkylation of amines with car
bonyl compounds and H2 via the generation of FLP species has 
been widely accepted as a wasteminimizing process that gen
erates valuable Nalkylated amines, whereby H2O is the only 
byproduct.23,2731 Our group30 and that of Sos28 have inde
pendently shown that triarylboranes effectively catalyze the re
ductive alkylation of a variety of amines with aldehydes in the 
presence of H2.
