Description:
A heavy metal often found in colloidal nanoplatelets.

Text:
Colloidal nanoplatelets are ultrathin 2D nanomaterials
whose outstanding optical properties triggered a wide
research effort. (1) However they usually contain heavy
metals such as cadmium, (2, 3) lead (4) or mercury whose
toxicity is a drawback to their use wide acceptance. In the
quest for more environment and health benign materials,
indium based nanoparticles are often thought of as possible
alternatives. Among them, indium sulde is a wide band gap
semiconductor material which has useful properties such
as longterm stability and low toxicity when compared to
its toxic counterparts.
