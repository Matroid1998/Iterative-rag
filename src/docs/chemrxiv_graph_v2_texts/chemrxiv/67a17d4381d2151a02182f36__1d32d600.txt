Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have potential applications in the safe and highperformance 
solidstate lithium batteries on account of their safety and processibility features.12 To date, the most 
extensively studied class of SPEs are polyethylene oxides (PEOs) and their derivatives.36 The polymer 
chains of PEO can form stable solvation structures with lithium cations via strong ether oxygenLi 
interactions, which allows PEO to mix well with a range of lithium salts at relatively high concentrations 
and to support the transport of lithium cations through the chainsegmental motion.4, 67 However, one of 
the major problems with the parent PEO electrolyte and many PEOderived electrolyte materials is the high 
crystallinity of the polymerLi salt mixtures,78 severely limiting their ionic conductivities at room 
temperature and hindering their wide applications.
