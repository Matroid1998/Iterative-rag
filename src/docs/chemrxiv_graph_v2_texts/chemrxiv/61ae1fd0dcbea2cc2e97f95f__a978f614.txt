Description:
A hard refractory semiconductor with a melting temperature of 2840 K and a wide bandgap of 2.1 eV.

Text:
Boron phosphide BP is a hard (Vickers hardness HV  30 GPa 1) refractory (melting temperature 
at ambient pressure is 2840 K 2) and lowcompressible (300K bulk modulus is 174 GPa 3) 
wide bandgap (Eg  2.1 eV 4) semiconductor with outstanding chemical and hightemperature 
stability that makes it a promising material for a wide range of applications 5. Under ambient 
conditions, BP crystallizes in cubic sphalerite (F43m) structure with boron and phosphorus 
tetrahedrally coordinated to each other. Another tetrahedral structure of boron phosphide, hexagonal 
wurtzite (P63mc) polymorph, has also been reported 6, however, in the literature there is no data 
on the structure and properties of this phase.

Description:
A compound with recent synthesis methods characterized by simplicity, high efficiency, low cost, and good prospects for large-scale production.

Text:
The main limitation for the use of boron phosphide is the lack of relatively simple and economical 
methods of its production, especially, of BP single crystals. The disadvantages of existing methods 
are the use of toxic and aggressive reagents, complicated technical implementation and high time 
consumption. Recently, two new methods of boron phosphide synthesis have been developed i.e. Corresponding author (vladimir.solozhenkounivparis13.fr) 

selfpropagated hightemperature synthesis 7 and mechanochemical synthesis 8 that are 
characterized by simplicity, high efficiency, low cost and good perspectives for largescale 
production. Here we report the results of transmission electron microscopy studies of BP produced 
by selfpropagated hightemperature synthesis. Experimental
