Description:
A microchip that can amplify the signal based on redox cycling.

In addition, the 
biosensors should be able to provide a sensitive response in the appropriate concentration range (0.011 M for 
a healthy individual and in the nanomolar range for patients with Parkinsons disease) 2. In this study, sensitive 
detection of DA was performed with a dual ITO microchip that can amplify the signal based on redox cycling. The 33 mm working areas of two ITO microchips were designed to overlap with the help of doublesided tape, 
and a dual ITO microchip was created with a microchannel. The applicability of the dual ITO microchip as a 
biosensor was analyzed using different concentrations of DA solution. 2. Materials and Methods
