Description:
Formation is largely hindered in SDIB copolymer cathodes involving short sulfur chains.

Text:
It has also been observed that the stability of SDIB copolymers is
brought about by the formation of short S chains.3 In addition, short S chains have been
predicted4 and reported5,6 to be more favorable in other sulfurcarbon copolymer materials
involving organic groups interconnected via sulfur chains. The formation of Lipolysulfides
during discharge has been shown to be largely hindered in SDIB copolymer cathode involv
ing short S chains and therefore, they exhibit a much better performance in terms of cycle
