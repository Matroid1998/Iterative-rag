Description:
Formed by reacting potassium hydroxide with carbon.

Pre
dictions (at T0K) indicate that the ground state is not molec
ular, but akin to a lactonelike polymer.5, 6 A variety of CObased 
polymeric structures, both metallic and narrow band gap sem
iconductors, have been observed at elevated pressures.7, 8 
The reactivity of CO is increased by reduction, which allows it 
to undergo homologation reactions,9 forming oxocarbon ani
ons.1014 Such processes constitute potent CC coupling routes 
and synthesis of oxycarbonbased materials have been pur
sued for over a century. The first attempts were probably made 
by Berzelius, Wohler, and Kindt15 in 1823, who reacted potas
sium hydroxide with carbon to form dipotassium croconate 
(K2C5O5).
