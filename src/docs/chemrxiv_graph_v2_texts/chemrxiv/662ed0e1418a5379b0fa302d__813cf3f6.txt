Description:
Precursors for generating electrophilic nitrenes in situ.

Text:
Due to the high nucleophilicity of bo
ranes, they react under mild conditions with electrophilic 
nitrenes generated in situ from the corresponding sulfon
amides and sulfamates. Insertion of nitrenes into prochiral 
boranes with 2arylpyridine framework in the presence of 
chiral rhodium and ruthenium carboxylates gives access to 
rare compounds with stereogenic boron centers. Scheme 1. Metalcatalyzed insertion of carbene and 
nitrenes into CH and BH bonds.
