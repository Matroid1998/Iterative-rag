Description:
Involved in key redox processes such as activation in biological systems.

Text:
Longrange electron transfer (ET) reactions are fundamen
tal in chemical and biological systems.17 In biology, long
range ET reactions are widely involved in many key redox 
processes, such as O2 activation,8, 9 respiration,10, 11 nitrogen 
fixation,12, 13 and photosynthesis.14, 15 These longrange ET 
reactions occur for a donoracceptor distance of up to more 
than 20 angstroms,16 which are usually nonadiabatic and 
can be described by the semiclassical Marcus theory.17, 18 
The longrange ET reactions may occur through different 
mechanisms, such as through outersphere ET or proton
coupled electron transfer (PCET).25, 1924 However, the selec
tions of different ET mechanisms by nature are not well 
known in some proteins. In addition, how pH regulates the 
longrange ET is still elusive in many proteins.
