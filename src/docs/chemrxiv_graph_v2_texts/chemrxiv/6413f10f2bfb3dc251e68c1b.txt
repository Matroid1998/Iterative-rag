Description:
A conserved framework in peptide-protein sequences.

Advances in computer sciences, accessible highperforming machines and the 
proliferation of large public databases have accelerated the development of 
computational models for peptide design and protein engineering. The advent of 
artificial intelligence (AI) in the biological sciences has led to the creation of machine 
learning (ML) models capable of predicting and generating new peptides and proteins 
with the desired characteristics. Predictive models are trained on smalltolarge 
datasets to learn the relationships between the biological sequences and their 
respective functional measurements (e.g., thermostability, bacterial growth inhibition, 
protein binding affinity). Generative models can learn meaningful representations 
(e.g., a conserved cysteine framework, a catalytic site) to create new peptideprotein 
sequences that resemble the native counterparts.
