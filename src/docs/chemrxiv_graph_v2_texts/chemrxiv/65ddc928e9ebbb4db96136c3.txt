Description:
A classical surfactant studied in polyelectrolyte-surfactant mixtures.

Text:
Polyelectrolytesurfactant (PS) mixtures play a major role in 
various applications ranging from personal care products to 
drug delivery systems and paints.13 That is because of their ver
satile physical properties that can be used to stabilise the rele
vant soft matter interfaces, e.g. in foams or emulsions, while 
they can also control bulk properties like viscosity and electro
phoretic mobilities.47 Owing to their widespread use in appli
cations, the properties of PS mixtures with classical surfactants 
like dodecylsulfate or alkylammonium in bulk solutions and at 
interfaces are studied extensively to the present day.512 Using 
different PS mixing ratios allows one to tailor soft matter prop
erties such as the size of the PS aggregates that form after mix
ing or the stability of aqueous foam.
