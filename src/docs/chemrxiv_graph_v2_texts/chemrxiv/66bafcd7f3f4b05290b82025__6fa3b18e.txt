Description:
Products of overoxidation in oxidation reactions with low reactivity and enantioselectivity.

Text:
This difficulty stems from oxygens 
tendency as a harder base to coordinate strongly with hard acids according to the Hard and Soft 
Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory (2526). Oxygen often exhibits poor coordination with late
transition metals, which are soft acids (2729). This mismatch results in low reactivity and 
enantioselectivity in these oxidation reactions and frequently causes overoxidation to ketones. (30). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024hqqb0 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000247003765 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
