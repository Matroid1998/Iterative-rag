Description:
A ternary chalcogenide material with lower band gaps, making it competitive for solar cell applications.

Text:
In response to the challenges posed by the toxicity and 
stability concerns inherent in inorganicorganic lead halide 
perovskites, a class of ternary chalcogenide materials with the 
general formula ABQ3, (A Ca, Ba, Sr; B  Zr, Hf, Ti; Q S Se) has 
been put forth as a promising alternative for optoelectronic and 
solar cell applications.12,13 A subset of the materials in this class 
are known to take on a stable perovskite structure under at 
least some conditions, including CaZrS3, SrZrS3, BaZrS3, CaHfS3, 
and BaHfS3;1315 of these, BaZrS3 has garnered the most interest 
largely because of its lower observed band gaps, falling within 
the range of 1.75 to 1.94 eV.12,14,1621 While these values make 
it potentially competitive for solar cell applications, especially in 
a tandem device with silicon, these band gaps are somewhat 
higher than the ideal for singlejunction solar cells and higher 
than those accessible with lead halide perovskites.

Description:
A compound whose band gap can be reduced through alloying with Ti4 or Se2.

Text:
However, 
theoretical calculations based on density functional theory 
(DFT) suggest that the band gap of BaZrS3 can be reduced 
through alloying, either by incorporating 3d cation Ti4 to lower 
the conduction band minimum (CBM) or by introducing 4p 
anion Se2 to elevate the valence band maximum (VBM); both 
of these possibilities have been investigated experimentally as 
well as computationally.14,22,23 However, it should be noted that 
neither BaTiS3 or BaZrSe3 is known to occur in a perovskite 
phase; BaTiS3 crystallizes in a hexagonal (P63mmc) phase 
consisting of onedimensional chains of edgesharing TiS6 
octahedra interspersed with Ba2 cations.13,24 
 Syntheses of these materials, particularly BaZrS3 and its 
titanium alloys, have historically relied on very high 
temperatures ( 900 oC), incompatible with typical thinfilm 
device processing.13,18,25,26 Improved synthetic approaches have 
recently allowed BaZrS3 powder to be produced at 
temperatures as low as 550 C, employing molten BaS3 as a 
flux.25,27,28 Some efforts have focused on preparing BaZrS3 thin 
films; Surendran et al.

Description:
Crystalline thin films produced at temperatures as low as 500 Â°C using solution deposition of molecular precursors.

Text:
achieved temperatures below 700 C 
through pulsed laser deposition,29 while Comparotto et al. grew 
BaZrS3 thin films at 600 C using sputtering and sulfurization.30,31 
More recently, significant advances have been made by Agarwal 
and Bart in preparing thin films from the solution deposition of 
molecular precursors, with crystalline thin films of BaZrS33, 
BaTiS3, and BaHfS3 produced at temperatures as low as 500 
oC.32,33 
 An alternative approach to solutionprocessed thin film 
deposition is through the preparation and use of colloidal 
nanocrystal inks;34,35 notably, Nag et al.
