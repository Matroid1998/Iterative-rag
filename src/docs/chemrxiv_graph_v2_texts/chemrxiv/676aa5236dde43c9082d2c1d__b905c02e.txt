Description:
Used in lithium-ion battery electrodes for its ability to transport ions or charge.

Text:
One widely used approach to relate a materials porosity to its ability to transport ions or charge 
is the Bruggeman equation, which has been widely used to link porosity to transport properties 
in materials such as lithiumion battery graphite electrodes24,25. However, its assumptions of 
uniform particle distribution and isotropic pores are inadequate for nanoporous carbons, which
