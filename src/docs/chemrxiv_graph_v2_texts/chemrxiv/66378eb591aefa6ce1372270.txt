Description:
Forms complex structures with transition metals due to its ability to bond in multiple oxidation states.

Text:
These metals often have multiple oxidation states, which allows them to form 
complex structures with oxygen atoms. The big three are tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), and 
vanadium (V), that together with niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and chromium (Cr), are the most 
common POM transition metals buildingblocks. POM chemists have classified the clusters into two 
big groups that involve the presence or absence of heteroatom isopolyoxometalates (or isopolyanions, 
IPAs) have the formula MnOx q, and heteropolyoxometalates (or heteropolyanions, HPAs) with the 
formula XnMnOx q being XP, Si, Ge, As, Se, Te, etc. Classic structures of polyoxometalates, such 
as the Keggin type (typically XM12O40n) and the WellsDawson type (typically X2M18O62n), are 
characterized by their highly symmetrical clusters which exhibit remarkable versatility in terms of 
composition, shape, and potential applications.
