Description:
A traditional thermoelectric material containing toxic and rare elements.

Text:
Ideally TE materials would show the low thermal conductivity characteristic of an
amorphous material (glass) and the high electrical conductivity of a crystal  a phononglass, electroncrystal
material.3
In recent years the focus has been on transitioning from traditional thermoelectric materials such as PbTe,
Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3, which contain toxic and rare elements, to materials formed from more abundant and
environmentallyfriendly components. In theory, oxides are a good t for thermoelectric applications given
their hightemperature stability in air, low toxicity and straightforward synthesis paths.
