Description:
Provides higher stability of the soft segments inside the body.

Text:
Possibility to use different hard and soft segments for synthesizing polyurethane 
22 
to achieve desired properties made them versatile and tunable polymers. For example, different kind of polyurethanes 
23 
such as polycarbonate urethane, urethane acrylates, polyurethane polyols, polyester urethane, and polyether urethane 
24 
have been synthesized by changing the soft segment (Polyol groups) and have been used in different applications 23
25 
33. Among aforementioned synthetic polyurethanes, recent studies have been shown that polycarbonate based 
26 
urethanes have better biocompatibility and biostability than other kinds of polyurethanes for medical applications 
27 
which was correlated to higher stability of the soft segments (polycarbonate) inside of the body 34.

Description:
Forms the basis of polycarbonate urethanes, contributing to their oxidative stability and biostability.

Text:
Furthermore, recent reports in comparison of the biocompatibility of polyether urethanes and 
34 
polycarbonate urethanes showed that polycarbonate based urethanes have higher oxidative stability and biostability, 
35 
which makes them good alternative to replace with polyether urethanes for biomedical applications 34, 37. 36
