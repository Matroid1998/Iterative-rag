Description:
An electron-deficient ring widely used as an acceptor in organic photocatalysts, light emitters, and sensors.

In addition, we found that highly conjugated, ordered polymer 
photocatalysts benefit less from coadded platinum than glassy, disordered polymers systems.5 
Considering the rapid development of the field, the variety of electronaccepting building blocks 
commonly employed is surprisingly small. The electrondeficient triazine (C3N3) ring is widely 
used as an acceptor in organic photocatalysts, light emitters, and sensors, due to its ubiquitous 
derivatives that can be obtained easily e.g. by the acidcatalyzed trimerization of aromatic
