dimeric and oligomeric annihilators confirms that

intramolecular TTAUC (intraTTAUC) helps to circumvent

106 
a definitive scheme describing the process of intraTTAUC

and how it affects the efficiency of TTAUC is still lacking. 108 
Intramolecular SF (intraSF) in molecular dimers and

oligomers is at the forefront of recent investigations of this

process.
