easily tunable optical and electronic properties, as well as strong
absorption of visible and nearinfrared light.5,6 The wavelengths
of strongest intensity from the sun that reach Earths surface fall
into the visible and nearIR regions7,8, so maximizing the absorp
tion of this area is vital to high efficiency. The development of materials for OSCs is constantly evolving. Specifically, for NFAs, new molecules are rapidly being developed. Most often, these new molecules are slight variations of previ
ously synthesized NFAs, such as changing a fluorine to chlorine
or varying the length of a side chain. Many review articles have
been published918 that summarize certain subclasses of NFAs
and their photovoltaic performance, which can be beneficial to
map the progress of the field.
