Description:
Used as a conductive additive in battery porous electrodes.

Text:
Alkaliion batteries are comprised of porous electrodes infiltrated with liquid electrolytes. Typical battery 
porous electrodes are constructed by slurry casting a composite of redoxactive particles, carbon conductive 
additives, and polymer binders onto a metal current collector1. While porous electrodes are widely used due 
to their manufacturability and practicality, their heterogeneity has limited the ability to interpret the 
electrochemical signature. Sources of heterogeneity include uneven current distribution leading to different 
states of charge among battery particles26, interactions between binder and active materials affecting cycle 
life7,8, and electrode tortuosity limiting the rate performance of the battery911. Moreover, discerning signals 
from individual redoxactive particles is exceedingly challenging because the electrochemical signatures 
contain average information from an ensemble of many individual particles.
