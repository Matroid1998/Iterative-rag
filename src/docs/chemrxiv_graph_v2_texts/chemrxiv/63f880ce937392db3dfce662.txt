Description:
Highly permeable through water-in-water emulsion interfaces.

Text:
Waterinwater (WW) emulsions are droplets derived from spontaneous liquid
liquid phase separation of a macromolecular solution.1 In biology, membraneless 
organelles and nuclear bodies are representative WW emulsions,2, 3 and they serve as 
liquid chambers to compartmentalize biomolecules and coordinate their cellular 
functions. Bioactive molecules and cells largely preserve their native structures and 
biological functions in the allaqueous environment.4, 5 Consequently, WW emulsions 
are more advantageous over traditional wateroil emulsions for processing of 
biomolecules,1, 4, 6, 7 and they are increasingly exploited as liquid scaffolding for 
patterning of cells, culture of organoids and printing of tissues.813 WW interface are 
highly permeable to oxygen, nutrients, metabolic waste, and even living cells.
