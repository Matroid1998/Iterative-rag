Description:
Enhances light absorption and reduces recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in photocatalytic processes.

Text:
Also, MOFderived ZnOdoped C exhibited high 
adsorption and photocatalytic performance on methylene blue (MB) degradation under sunlight 
irradiation, as the presence of carbon would enhance the light absorption, reduce the recombination 
of photogenerated electronhole, and increase the MB around the photocatalytic active sites in
