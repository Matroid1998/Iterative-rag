Description:
A neurotransmitter involved in motor symptoms management in Parkinson's disease.

Text:
Around 10 million people worldwide are living with 
Parkinsons disease (PD)1, a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by both motor (e.g. bradykinesia, 
resting tremor, postural instability, rigidity) and nonmotor 
(e.g. memory loss, hyposmia) disabilities. Current PD 
treatment is limited to motor symptoms management with 
dopamine replacement or by enhancing the activity of the 
remaining dopaminergic neurons. No known therapy is 
available that can slow down the progress or prevent the 
onset of the disease. Furthermore, PD cases are growing at 
a fast ever speed and are projected to increase to over 17.5 
million by 2040 due to the fastgrowing aging population2.
