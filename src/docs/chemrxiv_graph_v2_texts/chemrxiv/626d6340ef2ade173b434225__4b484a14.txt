Description:
An electrocatalyst with an established track record for CO2 reduction reactions.

Text:
A carbonneutral, or even 
negative, cycle demands viable approaches to capture and convert CO2 into compounds with 
added value.2,3 Consequently, a great deal of research is ongoing toward means to promote the 
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).4,5 Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) of the 
general formula MX2 (M 4 or 5 metal, XSTe) constitute a class of compounds attracting 
interest for this purpose thanks to high activity and physicochemical tunability.6 Beyond CO2RR, 
TMDCs have shown broad catalytic activity towards other reactions, such as oxygen reduction,7 
hydrodesulfurization,8,9 and hydrogen evolution (HER).10,11 Among TMDCs, MoS2 has the most 
established track record as a CO2RR electrocatalyst,12,13 thus serving a good model system to 
uncover fundamental underpinnings of function that may apply to TMDCs as a class of materials.

Description:
Shows high selectivity towards reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotential with an ionic liquid cocatalyst.

Text:
MoS2 shows a high selectivity towards reduction of CO2 to CO at low overpotential when an ionic 
liquid cocatalyst is present in the aqueous electrolyte.12 Increases in electrocatalytic activity of 
MoS2 for CO2RR have been correlated with the existence of defect sites, such as edges and S 
vacancies.14,15 Beyond CO2RR, the electrochemical generation of S vacancies in MoS2 prior to 
conducting HER has been proposed to enhance its electrocatalytic activity.1618 Conventional 
correlations between synthetic control and macroscopic CO2RR performance in the literature do 
not directly probe mechanistic causality.

Description:
An electrocatalyst used in CO2 reduction reactions.

Text:
Here, we follow the evolution of the electronic structure in MoS2 electrocatalysts during CO2RR 
using operando Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We probed both the ligand and metal 
centers under functional CO2RR conditions and simulated the corresponding spectroscopic 
signatures using firstprinciples calculations. Thus, we report direct spectroscopic evidence of 
CO2 binding to Mo at sulfur vacancies, which perturbs the hybridization between S 3p and Mo 4d 
states. The spectroscopic signatures of the active state are consistent with the reduction of Mo, 
revealing its role in mediating charge transfer to CO2.
