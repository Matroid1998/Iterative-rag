Description:
Used as an additive for the formation of columnar lithium morphologies.

Text:
Growth of smooth lithium morphologies 
attributed to electrostatic shielding for example16, was later found to consist of a particular 
selfaligned and compact nanorod morphology17. Such a columnar morphology is very similar to the results first obtained by Kanamura et al.18 
using HF as an additive, and later with trace amounts of water for the insitu formation of HF 
through the hydrolysis of an LiPF6 electrolyte19. This growth mode is commonly attributed to 
the formation of a LiF solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer mainly based on Xray 
photoelectron spectroscopy2022. So far, deposition of columnar lithium layers has attracted
