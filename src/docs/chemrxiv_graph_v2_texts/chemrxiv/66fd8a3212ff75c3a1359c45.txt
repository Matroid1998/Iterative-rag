Description:
Used in the process of microarray development, but can leave behind residue leading to nonspecific attachment in bioassays.

of crosslinking agents within the bioink to induce covalent 
attachment as well as additives to control fluid evaporation rates can be investigated in CP for 
microarray development.23,26,30,31 Furthermore, the PDMS stamps used in the process can leave 
behind residue, leading to nonspecific attachment and ultimately reducing the sensitivity in 
bioassays. CP also has challenges in scalability for industry translation and is predominantly used 
in lab scale settings. This is mainly due to the lack of characterization and assessment of factors 
affecting the repeatability and reproducibility of CP microarrays, resulting in low signaltonoise 
ratios (SNRs) and high percentage coefficients of variance. 12,21 3238 
We propose a fully characterized CP protocol for repeatability and reproducibility.
