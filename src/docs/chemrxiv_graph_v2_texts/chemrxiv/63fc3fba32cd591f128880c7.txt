Text:
TiO2, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or Titania, is a transition metal oxide material commonly used 
as a catalyst in various industrial applications due to its abundance and low cost 17. Over the past fifty years, 
the catalytic activity of TiO2 has been extensively studied. TiO2 has two main crystal structures, the rutile type 
(RTiO2) and the anatase type (ATiO2). While bulk rutile is the most thermodynamically stable crystalline 
phase of TiO2 8, the difference in free energy between RTiO2 and ATiO2 is relatively small 9. TiO2 
nanoparticles with a size smaller than approximately 14 nm are more stable in the anatase form due to the lower 
surface energy of the anatase planes 1014.

Description:
A compound that exists in metastable anatase phase, transforming into rutile at temperatures above approximately 870 K.

Text:
However, anatase is a metastable phase of TiO2 and transforms 
into rutile at temperatures above approximately 870 K 8,16. As the temperature or particle size increases, TiO2 
nanoparticles transform into a mixture of rutile and anatase. There are relatively few experimental reports on 
anatase surfaces compared to rutile surfaces due to the limited availability of large anatase single crystals 17. However, anatase surfaces are known to be more reactive than rutile surfaces 1722, although chemical 
reactions on ATiO2 surfaces have not been thoroughly investigated. M o2
