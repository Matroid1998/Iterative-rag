Description:
Involved in sequestration processes for subsurface disposal and environmental applications.

Numerical simulations of chemical diffusion coupled with porescale chemical 
34 
reactions play a fundamental role in a wide range of applications, including the 
35 
development of subsurface disposal of nuclear waste repositories 1, CO2 
36 
sequestration 2, assessment of contaminants transport in lakes, rivers, soils, and 
37 
marine sediments 3, and hydrocarbon recovery 4. However, under natural 
38 
conditions, understanding these processes is particularly challenging due to the 
39 
complexity inherent in the system and the difficulty in retrieving or accessing detailed 
40 
information. Moreover, these processes can occur over spatial scales ranging from 
41 
micrometers to kilometers and temporal scales ranging from (sub)seconds to years.
