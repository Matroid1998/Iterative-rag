At the present time mono, multilayer, and hybrid heterostructures based on inorganic and 
organic materials, in particular polymeric materials, are used in the creation of photovoltaic 
converters of solar energy, molecular optoelectronic and photonics devices 112. The polymer 
naphthalimide derivatives exhibited high photoconductivity and excellent thermal morphological 
stability in their solid amorphous states, providing a stable photophysical and photoelectric 
properties for practical applications in molecular photonics. On the other hand, the organic dyes 
that have a high extinction coefficient and a wide range of spectral luminescence and energy

Description:
A photoconductive compound used in the preparation of photosensitive PPCs.

Text:
Materials and methods 
To prepare the novel photosensitive PPCs we used the photoconductive naphthalimide
containing copolymer poly(4(1,3dioxo1Hbenzodeisoquinolin2(3H)yl)phenyl 
methacrylatecononyl methacrylate (CoNaphNMA) as the polymeric matrix of the PPCs, and 
the symmetric CPDs 13 as sensitizers of photoconductivity (Scheme 1)
