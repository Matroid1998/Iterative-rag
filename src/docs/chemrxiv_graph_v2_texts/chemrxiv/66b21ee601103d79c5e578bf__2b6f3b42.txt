Description:
Concentric nanoparticles known as carbon nano onions that can improve the stiffness of peptide gels.

In particular, the anisotropic morphology of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), was found to 
be ideal to yield a hybrid matrix with peptide fibrils, providing hydrogels with a remarkable increase in 
stiffness, especially in the case of doublewalled CNTs.10 Besides, also quasispherical carbon nano
onions (CNOs), which are concentric fullerene nanoparticles, could improve the stiffness of the peptide 
gels, although to a lower extent.11 Importantly, oxidized CNOs were found to noncovalently interact 
with the selfassembling peptide molecules, without interfering with their ability to stack and fibrillate 
for gelation, whilst effectively inhibiting fibrils bundling into fibers. As a result, in the presence of 
oxidized CNOs, peptide selfassembly yielded a gelling network of thinner fibrils that were better 
interconnected, thus more resistant against gel rupture due to applied stress.
