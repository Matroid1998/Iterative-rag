Description:
Dominated by transition metals with applications in homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, photochemistry, and stabilization of unusual metal oxidation states.

Text:
In recent years, the combination of a Bcenter together with 
carbenes or other main group components has turned out to be an attractive strategy for activating and 
converting inert bonds in small molecules.2128 
Since the first report on mesoionic carbenes (MIC) of the 1,2,3triazol5ylidene (Figure 1) type more 
than 15 years back, the chemistry of this compound class has been dominated by transition metals2932

a few reports have appeared either on the transformations of MICs into organic redox systems,36 or on 
the combination of MICs with main group element fragments.29, 3739 In the following, we report the 
synthesis and characterization of a 1,2,3triazol5ylidenebased MIC supported 9BBN adduct.
