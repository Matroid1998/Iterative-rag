Description:
Used in high-cost materials such as carbon nanotube-based electrodes.

quinones, redoxactive amines).15,20,21 Redoxtechniques tend to have a more limited cyclelife, and frequently 
involve high cost materials such as carbon nanotubebased electrodes, redoxactive specialty polymers, copper, special 
amines, and ionic liquids. Quinones and amines tend to be oxygensensitive. Electrochemical methods based on pHswings, 
e.g. membranecapacitive deionization (MCDI),22 electrolysis,23 and bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED),24 have also 
been reported. However, MCDI require expensive materials such as cation and anionexchange membranes. Electrolysis and 
BPMED capture methods also require cation and anion exchange membranes and have high energy consumption (300 
kJ.mol1).5,15
