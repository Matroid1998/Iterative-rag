With the PowertoX technology the possibility arises to convert surplus fluctuating renewable 
2 
electricity into chemical energy. Especially the storage of electrical energy in synthetic natural gas 
3 
(SNG) via the PowertoGas process (PtG) is a promising option for temporal decoupling of energy 
4 
availability and demand.13 Therefore, H2 is produced from electrical energy via water electrolysis, 
5 
which is subsequently used for methanation of carbon oxides available from various sources. For 
6 
instance, by utilizing industrial exhaust gases as carbon sources the potential to convert highly 
7 
concentrated CO2 into CH4 directly at the emitting spot reduces the effort for CO2 separation prior 
8 
to hydrogenation. However, these exhaust gases may also contain CO, i.e.

From an economic viewpoint the implementation of decentralized smallscale methanation 
12 
plants in proximity of carbon point sources associated with available renewable energy sources is 
13 
advantageous.2 Such units, however, require minimal upstream buffer capacities to be cost
14 
effective. This consequently leads to a propagation of fluctuations in reactant availability and 
15 
composition into the reactor, which is the case for both H2 and the COCO2 source. Hence, the
