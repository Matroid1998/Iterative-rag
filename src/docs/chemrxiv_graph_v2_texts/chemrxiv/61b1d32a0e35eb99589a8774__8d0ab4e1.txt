Description:
A fluoroquinolone recommended by WHO for treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis.

Text:
Tuberculosis is a difficult disease to treat; the standard regimen is four antibiotics, rifampicin, 
isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, for six months. An infection that is resistant to both 
rifampicin and isoniazid is called multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) and the treatment 
regimen recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) is complex but always includes 
levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, which are fluoroquinolones1. Rifampicin acts by binding to the subunit of the RNA polymerase (RNAP, encoded by the rpoB 
gene), preventing the extension of the RNA (Fig. 1a). The most common resistanceconferring 
mutation is rpoB S450L, however a wide range of mutations have been observed clinically25.
