(hexyloxy)1ethenylbenzene is reported in synthesis and optical properties of bipolar 
quinoxalinetriphenylamine based stilbene compounds 14; in studies of impact of charge 
density on hostguest interactions within amphiphilic polymer assemblies in apolar media 
15; in synthesis of resveratrol derivatives as new analgesic drugs through desensitization 
of the TRPA1 receptor 16; in synthesis of alkoxysubstituted hexastyrylbenzenes 17; in 
DielsAlder reaction on the fullerene core 18, and in synthesis of new liquid crystalline 
compounds based on 1,4diarylbuta1,3dienes 19. 3
