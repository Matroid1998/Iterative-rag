Description:
Produced from the reduction of nitrogen by the iron-molybdenum cluster in nitrogenase.

(A) Metal cofactors present in humans that drive crucial physiological processes. Structure of the hemeiron copper center in hemecopper oxidase (PDB 7DEG) which drives oxygen reduction during respiration is shown at 
the top. Structure of the hemeiron center in myoglobin (Mb) (PDB 2VLY) that enables oxygen storage in muscles is shown at the bottom. (B) 
Metal cofactors critical in biological processes in plants. Calciummanganese cluster of photosystem (II) (PDB 4UB6) which is involved in light
dependent photosynthesis is shown at the top, while ironmolybdenum cluster in nitrogenase (PDB 1M1N) responsible for reduction of nitrogen
