Description:
An atom used in functionalized molecules with roles in life science and materials.

Text:
Fluorinated molecules play pivotal roles in several chemical areas ranging from life science to materials.1 In this context, the increased 
interest in accessing functionalized molecules bearing a fluorine atom favoured the development of very efficient methodologies for the 
incorporation of fluorinated motifs.2 Among these fluorinated motifs, the SCF3 group has attracted considerable attention over the past 
decade.3 This group possesses unique physiochemical properties including high lipophilicity with a Hansch parameter value of 1.44.4 
Thus, such a moiety facilitates transmembrane permeation of the molecules improving their bioavailability.
