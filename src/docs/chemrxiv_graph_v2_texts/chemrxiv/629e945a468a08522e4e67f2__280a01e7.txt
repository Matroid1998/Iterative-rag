Description:
Used as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries.

Thus, the EV recharge times are not 
comparable to refueling times of gasolinepowered internal combustion engine vehicles. Consequently, there is a global push to enable extreme fast charging (XFC)3 that would reduce 
LIB charging times to 1015 minutes for 80 of the pack capacity, increase the charging power 
to 400 kW, and enable 20 miles min1 charging or faster. Current LIB technology containing graphite anodes, transition metal oxide cathodes, and liquid 
electrolytes cannot achieve these XFC goals without significant capacity loss over battery cycling.

Description:
An anode material in lithium-ion batteries that can degrade through Li plating and loss of interparticle connectivity.

Text:
One of the identified XFC failure pathways is graphite anode degradation, which includes Li 
plating, loss of interparticle connectivity, and delamination of anode from the current collector.4
8 Investigating the origins and characteristics of anode degradation spatially in three dimensions 
(3D) is imperative to understand its role in capacity fade and battery failure. Numerous methods 
have studied graphite anode degradation in LIBs.9 These include electrochemical methods,1011 
spectroscopic methods,12 optical imagingmicroscopy,13 scanning electron microscopy,1415 focused 
ion beamscanning electron microscopy,16 transmission electron microscopy,1718 scanning probe
