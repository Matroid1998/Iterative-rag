Description:
Can be utilized in the existing natural gas infrastructure.

Powertomethane (PtM) is a potential solution for the storage of excess renewable power 1 and it is
a source of low carbon gaseous fuel 2. The interest in PtM is supported by the fact that the product,
methane (CH4), can be utilized in the existing natural gas infrastructure. For example, the EU has
a network of approx. 2 million km of transmission and distribution with 800 TWh of underground
storage for natural gas 2. PtM can be applied for the conversion of industrial andor biogenic CO2
to CH4. Overall, application of PtM can integrate the renewable power grid with biomethanenautral
gas grid, which will oer exibility to the electricity grid while aiding decarbonization of other sectors
3.
