Description:
A small gap semiconductor.

The band structure is most commonly calculated using density functional theory (DFT)
with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals.57 However, GGA functionals
suffer from known inaccuracies in describing materials due to their lack of derivative discon
tinuities,8,9 and selfinteraction10 and delocalization errors.11,12 These inaccuracies manifest
through GGA functionals tendency to underestimate band gap energies13,14 and incorrectly
align band edges.15 Indeed, numerous previous reports have shown that GGAs predict inac
curate band gaps for diverse classes of materials, including small gap semiconductors, (e.g.,
PbS), semiconductors (e.g., ZnO, AlP), and wide gap semiconductors (e.g., NaF, MgO, AlN),
as one would expect for a groundstate theory such as DFT.1621 Other important energies
