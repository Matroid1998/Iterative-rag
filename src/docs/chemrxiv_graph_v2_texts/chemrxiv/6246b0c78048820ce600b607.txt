Description:
Molecules whose CO bond can be cleaved by a nonuniform charge transfer from the substrate.

One of the main interests 
of this mechanochemical reactivity is to be carried out at low 
pressure, typically in ultrahigh vacuum, which allows the use of 
scanning probe microscopies to identify the adsorbed products 
resulting from the collisions. In the case of electrontransfer 
induced by molecular collision, a recent study showed that CO 
bond of CO2 molecules can be cleaved by a nonuniform charge 
transfer from the substrate to CO2 molecules due to the 
conversion of kinetic energy of incident CO2 molecules into 
molecular deformation.5i However, no study has been reported 
for the dissociation of inert molecules like N2 using a similar 
activated 
electrontransfer 
mechanism 
on 
nonmetallic 
surfaces.
