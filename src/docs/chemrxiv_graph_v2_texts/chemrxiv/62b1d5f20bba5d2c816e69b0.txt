Description:
Monomers used in radical ring-opening polymerization with high functional group tolerance and predictable backbone degradability.

Text:
The radical ringopening polymerization (RROP) of suitable cyclic monomers provides access 
to (co)polymers featuring heteroatom backbone functionality including cleavable groups.1, 2 
RROP unfolds its full potential in combination with the architectural control offered by reversible 
deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods. Especially the combination of cyclic ketene 
acetals3 with RAFT polymerization4 has been exploited to prepare materials with high functional 
group tolerance, stimulus responsiveness, tailored architectures, and predictable backbone 
degradability.5 However, cyclic ketene acetals have disadvantages. They show slow 
copolymerization behavior due to the high energy of the intermediate acetal carbonbased radical 
and usually need to be fed in excess to force incorporation during copolymerizations of more
activated (meth)acrylic monomers. Furthermore, the resulting backbone ester groups require 
harsh, nonselective degradation conditions.
