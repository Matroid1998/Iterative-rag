Description:
An emerging class of mixed anion materials containing one or more different metal cations, at least one chalcogen anion, and at least one halide anion.

This can lead to increased 
structural anisotropy, changes in dimensionality and the evolution of novel structure 
types.2,3 Structural changes arising from such bonding variations facilitate the 
emergence of new physical phenomena46 and also provide opportunities for 
optoelectronic property tuning through modifications to the electronic structure.7,8 A 
multiple anion approach has already been successfully applied to engineer desirable 
properties in a variety of energy materials, including battery cathode materials,9,10 solid 
state electrolytes11 and thermoelectrics.1214 
Halidechalcogenide, or chalcohalide, materials are an emerging class of mixed anion 
materials that contain one or more different metal cations, at least one chalcogen anion 
and at least one halide anion.

Description:
Materials that allow for wider compositional and structural exploration through mixed anion chemistry.

The multifunctionality of these materials has made them 
a suitable platform for property tuning to suit a variety of applications, including 
photocatalysis15 and Xray detection.16 In particular, they have gained attention as 
potential solar absorbers, with the aim of using a split anion approach17 to combine the 
desirable optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) with the enhanced 
stability of chalcogenidebased materials.18,19 The opportunities for wider compositional 
and structural exploration through employing the mixed anion chemistry of chalcohalide 
materials makes them a valuable starting point for this task.20 Several mixedmetal
