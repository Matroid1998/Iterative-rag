Description:
A component in the synthesis of butadiene from ethanol.

Biobased processes are currently considered as potential candidates to substitute the petroleum 
industry, in particular bioethanol valorisation.37 The production of bioethanol reached 
120 billion litres in 2017 and is expected to rise above 130 billion litres by 2024.3 This 
important platform molecule has a wide array of applications,4, 5 among which the catalytic 
upgrading to butadiene is attracting a lot of attention.3, 814 Historically, Ostromislensky et al. proposed in 1915 a process to synthesize butadiene from a mixture of ethanol and acetaldehyde 
15. During the 1930s, another industrial process developed by Lebedev emerged where 
butadiene is obtained directly from ethanol 16. The technology made it possible to produce 
synthetic rubber, notably during the Second World War.
