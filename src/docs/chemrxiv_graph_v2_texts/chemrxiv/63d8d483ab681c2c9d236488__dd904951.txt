observed that 4BNMA can (i) facilitate complete derivatization of small mono and polycarboxylic acids, 
32 
(ii) feature a favorable fragmentation characteristic  bromine isotopic pattern, for unknown acid 
33 
identification, and (iii) improve selectivity in reversedphase LC.36 The fragmentation of derivatives to 
34 
phenyl bromine ion pair (mz 169 and 171) is an indicator to profile unknown carboxylic acid molecules. 35 
Thus, the selectivity of the derivatization is combined with computational isolation of the unique resulting 
36 
fragmentation pattern. This approach can significantly simplify the complex crude oil matrix and data 
37 
processing while increasing confidence in the formula assignments. The method performance was 
38 
comprehensively optimized and evaluated, focusing on extraction and derivatization, assessing method 
39 
sensitivity, and matrix effects.
