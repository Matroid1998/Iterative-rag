Description:
A target atom for methylation by SAM MTases.

Text:
Sadenosyl methionine methyltransferases (SAM MTases) are a ubiquitous class of 
enzymes. SAM MTases are observed in a wide range of organisms including bacteria, fungus, 
plants, and humans.14 SAM MTases catalyze SN2 methylation, using SAM as a methyl donor. Their functions are involved in many essential life processes, including gene expression,57 protein 
modification,810 neurotransmitter degradation,1113 and natural product synthesis.1416 SAM 
MTases target various types of atoms, including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur (Scheme 1).
