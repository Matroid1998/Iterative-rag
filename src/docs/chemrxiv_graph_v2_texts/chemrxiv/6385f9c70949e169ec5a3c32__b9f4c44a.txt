Hydroxyaryl ketones are synthetically important compounds 
with applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry.1 
The most common method for their preparation is the Fries 
rearrangement (Figure 1A), rendering a facile reaction pathway 
of high atom economy to access hydroxyaryl ketones from 
aromatic esters.14 This acidmediated reaction can be carried 
out with either Lewis, Brnsted, or solidacids, both, in the 
liquid and the gas phase.58 The latter requires high 
temperatures, not only favouring the deactivation of the 
catalysts by coking but also leading to poorer product selectivity 
compared to liquidphase reactions.7,9 Said selectivity is a major 
issue since both p and oisomers are formed. Their ratio 
strongly depends on the reaction temperature and the type and 
polarity of the solvent.
