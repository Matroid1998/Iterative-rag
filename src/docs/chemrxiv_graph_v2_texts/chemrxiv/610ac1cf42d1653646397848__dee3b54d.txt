Description:
Pyrazole-substituted derivatives of the borohydride, BH4 ion, known for their strong chelating ability.

In particular, lanthanide complexes with pyrazolylborate ligands, are of interest 
to researchers as they display single molecule magnet properties,3, 4 sensitized Ln3 emission5, 
6 as well as CH activation catalysis.79 Lanthanide pyrazolylborate complexes, despite their 
promising chemical and physical properties, are still relatively underexplored, with only a 
limited range of pyrazolylborates used.10, 11 
Pyrazolylborates are pyrazolesubstituted derivatives of the borohydride, BH4 ion, 
discovered by Trofimenko over 50 years ago.12 Trispyrazolylborate (Tp), where three of the 
four hydrides are replaced by pyrazole rings, is the most wellstudied type of pyrazolylborate 
owing to its strong chelating ability.
