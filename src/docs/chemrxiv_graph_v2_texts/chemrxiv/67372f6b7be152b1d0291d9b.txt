Description:
An alkali metal ion with low barrier height for penetration through GY1 and barrierless penetration through GY2, indicating potential use in lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Furthermore, previous studies have explored the binding and rattling motion 
(outofplane motion) of alkali metal ions through the triangular pores of GY1 and GY2, 
noting a low barrier height for the penetration of the Li ion through GY1 and a barrierless 
penetration through GY2. These findings support the potential use of these GYs as electrode 
materials in lithiumion batteries.17 However, while these materials offer great potential, 
conducting ab initio studies on such largescale twodimensional (2D) systems presents 
significant computational challenges due to the vast number of atoms and interactions involved. Consequently, there is a need to develop methods that can reproduce ab initio quality data at 
significantly lower computational costs. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20246pgl4 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000316251771 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
