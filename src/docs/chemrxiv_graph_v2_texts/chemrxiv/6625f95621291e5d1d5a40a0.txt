Description:
Confined to the topmost layer in PtAg surface alloys with a tendency to phase separation.

Text:
The structure, formation and stability of PtAgPt(111) surface alloys had been characterized previously 
by a variety of different techniques,2932 the results were summarized previously by Jankowski et al. 33 
and by Bauer et al.34 These studies found that deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on Pt(111) 
and subsequent annealing to about 620 K results in the formation of monolayer PtAg surface alloys, 
where the Ag atoms are confined to the topmost layer 24,29,30,32 with a tendency to phase separation to 
form twodimensional, homoatomic ensembles rather than a random distribution.25 Thermal and CO 
induced intermixing of Pt and Ag in Ag films on Pt(111) and in Pt film covered Ag(111) surfaces were 
investigated by Jankowski et al. 33 experimentally and by Hua et al.

Description:
Surface atoms that lead to a strengthening of the PtCO bond due to increased backdonation.

Most important for the present study is the finding of a pronounced ligand effect, with neighboring Ag 
surface atoms, leading to a strengthening of the PtCO bond, due to an increased backdonation from
