Description:
Found in microalgae as membrane components, storage products, metabolites, and energy sources.

Algae are multicellular organisms that range in size from singlecelled organisms to
multicellular organisms with sophisticated and differentiated forms. Algae thrive in wet locations or
bodies of water, making them widespread in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Algae, like plants,
rely on three things to thrive sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. Algae exist in largescale natural
sources. Lipids and fatty acids are found in microalgae as membrane components, storage products,
metabolites, and energy sources. Lipidsoils can make up anywhere from 2 to 40 of the weight of
algae. However, it is required to lower the total cost of biodiesel production by lowering the feedstock
cost by increasing algal biomass productivity.
