Description:
Reacts with elemental sulfur in a bimolecular opening of the S8 ring.

Text:
8 From 1955, Bartlett and coworkers reported kinetic studies on the 
reaction of elemental sulfur with triarylphosphines9 and cyanide, 12, 13 where they provided strong evidence that the 
ratedetermining step for the formation of the observed products is the bimolecular opening of the S8 ring by the 
nucleophile. They proposed the mechanism shown in (Scheme 1 path A) which was first formulated by Foss. 11 
In this proposal, the thiocyanate or phosphine sulfide is displaced by nucleophilic attacks on the adjacent sulfur of 
the progressively shrinking polysulfides, starting with the octasulfide 1.
