Description:
Increases carrier concentration when doped with hydrogen at the cost of a relatively small scattering cross-section.

Text:
An underexplored dopant in this 
context is hydrogen, which can be incorporated at interstitial or 
substitutional sites to form shallow donor states in the In2O3 to 
increase the carrier concentration at the cost of a relatively 
small scattering crosssection compared to F or SnTCOs1921. While 
reversible 
electron 
injection 
by 
(spectro) 
electrochemistry has been successfully demonstrated for 
almost all the QD examples listed above, hole injection is 
frequently more challenging. Potential reasons for this finding 
include the oxidation of the constituting anions andor ligands 
of the QDs, leading to weak or often nonexisting changes in the 
absorption spectra under oxidating electrochemical conditions.
