Description:
Negatively charged species combined with choline cation to form a new class of ionic liquid.

A similar kind of ultraslow solventco
solvent dynamics in the presence of reline is also established in our recent work, that effectively hinders 
the protein to deviate much from its equilibrium position.40 In this earlier work, we thoroughly analyzed 
the reline mediated structural protection of model protein HP36.41 FTIR42, timeresolved fluorescence 
spectroscopy6 have also been used to explore the stabilizing mechanism of reline. Choline cation has been 
combined with negatively charged amino acids to form a new class of IL, which has no environmental 
effects.43,44 Sahoo et al.
