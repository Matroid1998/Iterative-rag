Description:
Ligands that can engage in backbonding with metal centers, affecting bond strength and TEP value.

Text:
If the Ltype ligand is electron donating to the Ni metal center then there will be a propagated effect 
for donation to the CO ligands through backbonding, which results in weakening the CO bond strength 
and decreasing the TEP value. Conversely, if the Ltype ligand is electron withdrawing to the Ni metal 
center then there will be less donation to the CO ligands through backbonding resulting in a larger TEP 
value. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023wjnpj ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000156899762 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
