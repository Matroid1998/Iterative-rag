Description:
Used to heat MOF-immobilized, reactant-accessible POMs.

Text:
Here we report that uniformly organized arrays of non
aggregating polythiometalates can indeed be accessed by 
subjecting spatially separated, MOFimmobilized, reactant
accessible POMs to heating under H2S. We also report that 
the arrays exhibit salutary reductive catalytic activity for an 
intentionally simple, model reaction.
