Description:
A type of protonic zeolite with protons bonded to framework oxygen atoms to balance the framework charge.

in 2013, who compared three different samples of protonic zeolite Y 
with SiAl ratios of 2.5, 15, and 30 (in protonic zeolites, protons bonded to framework oxygen 
atoms balance the framework charge).22 While they observed similar 5FU loadings on the
