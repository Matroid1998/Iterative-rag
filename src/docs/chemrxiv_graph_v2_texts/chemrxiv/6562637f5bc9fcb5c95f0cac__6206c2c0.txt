Description:
Used as an acceptor in the synthesis of the orange-red emitter 4tBuCzTTR.

Text:
Zhang et al. reported an orangered emitter 4tBuCzTTR by using thianthrene 5,5,10,10tetraoxide as the 
acceptor, 3,6ditertbutyl9Hcarbazole (tCz) as the donor and the resulting SPOLEDs 
emitted at lEL 592 nm and showed an EQEmax of 6.2, which dropped to around 4.0 at 
1000 cd m2 (EQE1000).23 A deep red wedgeshaped organic fluorophore, 2TPAPPDC, was 
reported by Zhang et al., whose SPOLEDs emitted at lEL 670 nm and showed an EQEmax of 
3.2.24 A similar red emitter, DDTPACzDCPP, containing carbazole donors that are
