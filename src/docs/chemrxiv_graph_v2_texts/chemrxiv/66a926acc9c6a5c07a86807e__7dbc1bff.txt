Because 
of these features, the material has applications in sensors, actuators, waveguides, highcapacity computers, 
laser frequency doubling, nanoelectronic devices,  BaTiO3 is well suited for  ferroelectric memristors, 
multilayer ceramic capacitive transducers, infrared detectors, energy storage devices and various functional 
actuators (Parmar et al., 2023). Barium titanate was one of the first useful piezoelectric materials, developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Although this material does not have a very high piezoelectric constant, it has a very high permittivity, making 
it a good material for capacitors. ... Barium titanate exhibits a relatively low Curie temperature, however, and 
therefore has not seen many developments in recent years for applications in piezoelectric devices (Aksel and 
Jones, 2010).
