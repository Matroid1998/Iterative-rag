Description:
A standard semiconductor material used for comparison with wideband gap materials.

Text:
Semiconductors with band gap greater 
than 2 eV are classified as wideband gap (WBG) materials notable for properties of elevated thermal conductivity and high 
dielectric strength for high power applications along with high optical absorptivity and visible light emission for 
optoelectronic applications in comparison to standard semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium. Band gap refers 
to the minimum energy required for electron transition from valence to conduction band in a material, higher band gap of 
WBG semiconductors is responsible for operational utility at higher temperatures and visible light spectrum range of 
emission utilized by photonics technology. Using the Quantum Espresso DFT package, optoelectronic properties of BeSeO3 
such as band gap, density of states, refractive index and absorption coefficient are calculated.
