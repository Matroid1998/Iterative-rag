of bulkier substituents at the benzylic positions of 
the aniline moieties could be beneficial. Ultimately, we used IPr51 to obtain 3 in 82 
yield (entry 6). Control experiments revealed that the addition of both Ni and IPr is 
crucial to obtain 3 in high yield, albeit the addition of Ni(cod)2 alone gave the coupling 
product in poor yield (entries 79). We next investigated the effect of salts on the yield of

the crosscoupling reaction. When we ran the reaction without lithium salt, we obtained 
the desired product in moderate yield (entry 10). In contrast, the reaction using isolated 
ZnPh2 (under Li and Mgfree conditions) delivered the desired product in low yield 
(entry 11).
