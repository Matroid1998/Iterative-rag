Description:
Produced on a large scale using quinones.

Text:
In an increasinglyelectrified 
society, electrochemicallydriven CO2 capture at ambient conditions becomes an increasingly attractive option.25 
Quinones are ubiquitous electrontransfer carriers found in a range of living organisms.6,7 Featuring structural 
diversity, richness, and tunability as well as the earthabundance of the compositional elements (C, H, O, N, S), 
quinones have been used as industrial dyes and for largescale industrial production of hydrogen peroxide.8,9 Aqueous 
quinone flow batteries are approaching commercialization as a new generation of largescale energy storage
