Description:
Used in carbon-supported nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in PEMFCs.

Text:
In recent years, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), as ideal energy supply 
device, has received much attention owing to their good operability and high energy efficiency. However, the development of practical PEMFC has long been hindered by the short lifetime of 
membrane electrodes. The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), even 
using the best carbonsupported Pt nanocatalysts, is six orders of magnitude slower than that of 
the anode. Therefore, developing highperformance cathode catalysts is the key to accelerate 
the commercialization of PEMFCs. To date, carbonsupported Ptbased nanocatalysts are 
considered to be the most effective and massproducible cathode catalysts.1 However, Pt
based catalysts suffer from oxidative dissolution at potentials higher than 0.8 V vs. RHE, which 
can cause severe activity degradation.
