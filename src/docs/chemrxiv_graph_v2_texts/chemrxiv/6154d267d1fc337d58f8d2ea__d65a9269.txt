Description:
Synthesized by symbiotic bacteria and accumulated by metazoan hosts as a defense against predators.

Text:
It is now clear that TTX is synthesized by symbiotic 
bacteria and accumulated by their metazoan hosts as a defense against predators.4 Its 
toxicology and therapeutic utility in humans has been studied for decades and is still a 
matter of ongoing research.5 

As a synthetic target, TTX has been celebrated for the sheer intellectual challenge it 
provides and for the opportunity to demonstrate methodological and strategic advances. Its simple carbon framework, consisting of a cyclohexane ring with C1 and C2 side chains, 
stands in stark contrast to the dense network of polar functional groups that adorn it.
