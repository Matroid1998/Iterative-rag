Description:
Thin adsorbed films with an oxidelike structure formed upon exposure of metals to an oxygen atmosphere.

Still, it is in
teresting from a fundamental as well as from an applied
point of view how the overall conversion of the metal an
ode on Clion batteries from a bulk metal to a chloride
salt proceeds. It is wellknown that metals can form socalled surface
oxides, i.e. thin adsorbed films with an oxidelike struc
ture, upon the exposure of metals to an oxygen atmo
sphere as a function of the oxygen concentration 21, 22. Hence the question arises whether metal surfaces upon
the exposure to halogen species might form equivalent
structure corresponding to a surface salt, i.e., thin films
with metalhalide like structures.
