Description:
An anion tethered in single-ion polyelectrolytes to improve lithium transference number.

Text:
Saltinpolymer electrolytes involve a lithium 
salt dissolved in a polymer and usually suffer from low lithium transference numbers (with higher mobility 
of the anion compared to the cation under an electric field).13 To improve the transference number, single
ionpolyelectrolytes have been developed that immobilize the salt anion within the polymer backbone 
making the lithium ion the only mobile species, leading to a lithium transference number close to unity.30,31 
In this work, we fabricated singleion and saltinpolymer PFPE, with the tethered TFSI anion and LiTFSI 
salt dissolved (Figure 1), respectively. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR was used to study polymer 
environment, the lithium ion solvation structure and activation barrier for ion transport.32 MAS NMR 
provides high chemical shift resolution for these solid polymers and enables an understanding of ion
