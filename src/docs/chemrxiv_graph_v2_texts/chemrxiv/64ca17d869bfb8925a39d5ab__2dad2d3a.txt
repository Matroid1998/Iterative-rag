Description:
A compound used as a surface for ammonia decomposition in catalytic processes.

Text:
Here, we unravel the complex dynamic behaviour of a catalytic process in
operando conditions by investigating the ammonia decomposition on a lithium
imide (Li2NH) surface, a process that has received much attention for its pos
sible role in a future sustainable hydrogenbased economy9,10,11,12,13,14 We
perform state of the art simulations in which the interatomic forces are calcu
lated with an accuracy close to that of ab initio molecular dynamics15. Our
simulations reveal that the reactive process induces a change of state of the
interface. Such a modified interfacial state is the actual catalytic medium, and
one does not need to invoke any special stable arrangement of atoms.
