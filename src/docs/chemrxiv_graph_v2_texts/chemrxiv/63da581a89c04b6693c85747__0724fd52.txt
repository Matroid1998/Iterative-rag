Description:
Described as multistage Weitz type redox derivatives.

Text:
Organic redox systems are molecules that are both investigated for fundamental purposes (electron transfer processes and 
reactivity) and used in applied materials science (conducting materials, photovoltaic devices, batteries or spintronic).1 A 
common strategy to design such compounds is to link two heteroatoms through a bridge displaying an even number of sp2 
carbon atoms.2 Such derivatives are called Weitz type redox systems and typically display three stable redox states. Among 
them, tetrathiafulvalene and methylviologens (MV) are the most widely used electron donors and electron acceptors, 
respectively.3 Although the applicability of this strategy to phosphorus as the single heteroatom was postulated back in 1978,2 
organophosphorus multistage Weitztype redox derivatives were described by our group in 2020 only (Fig.
