Description:
An element sourced from pyrimidine rings by bacteria.

Modeling the interaction of proteins with small ligands, in particularly, for the goals of 
drug design is traditionally performed using molecular mechanics or classical molecular 
dynamics methods with force field parameters. Application of quantumbased simulation tools 
is also growing,1,2 but is still far from the routine use. In this work, we describe quantum
based simulations for a molecular system, which can hardly be handled at the classical level. Specifically, we characterize a reactant complex of a flavindependent enzyme RutA from 
Escherichia coli with the molecular oxygen and uracil. The RutA enzyme catalyzes a first step of uracil degradation in hydroxypropionate, 
ammonia, and carbon dioxide, allowing bacteria to use pyrimidine rings as nitrogen source3,4 
and belongs to a large family of flavoprotein monooxygenases (FMOs) widely spread across
