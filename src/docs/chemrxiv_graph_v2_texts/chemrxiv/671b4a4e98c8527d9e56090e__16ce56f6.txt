Description:
Involved in RNA self-replication by participating in primer extension reactions.

Text:
These efforts included further developments of
nonenzymatic primer extension of canonical and alternative
nucleic acids with phosphoroimidazolides on different hetero
geneous templates 1922 or immobilization of RNA 23 and
other or other forms of activation, like adenine derivatives 24. It included also various approaches to templated ligation
of RNA oligonucleotides, involving condensing agents and
organocatalysis 2528. The computational work presented
here focused on several variants of nonenzymatic template
copying involving phosphoroimidazolides, hence, we offer
more background on the associated scenarios below. The rate and fidelity of RNA selfreplication based on
nucleotide phosphoroimidazolides was further improved by
the consideration of short helper oligonucleotides, which
could bind downstream of the activated nucleotide monomers
which take part in the primer extension reaction 21,29.
