Description:
An environmentally friendly zero carbon energy resource that emits only water when consumed.

Text:
In contrast, hydrogen can be stored and used 
continuously for power generation and combustion, to be an environmentally friendly zero
carbon energy resource that emits no greenhouse gases but only water when consumed. Currently, hydrogen is often produced from fossil fuels, however, in the near future, it is 
expected to be produced by the electrolysis of water using the aforementioned renewable 
energies. The idea of converting surplus electricity from renewable energy sources into 
hydrogen and storing it is gaining traction. If this is realized, socalled green hydrogen will 
become one of the main energy resources for a decarbonized society 11, 12, 13, 14, 
15, 16, 17, 18. Since hydrogen is a gas under ambient conditions, it faces difficult problems during 
storage and transportation 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.

Description:
Requires special technology and large amounts of energy for storage as a gas in high-pressure tanks or as a liquid at extremely low temperatures.

Storing large amounts of gas in high
pressure tanks or as a liquid at extremely low temperatures requires corresponding special 
technology and large amounts of energy. Transporting by pipelines needs extensive 
infrastructure. Instead, there are two categories of other storage methods for hydrogen
