Description:
Used in emerging technologies like carbon capture using liquid solvents.

Foams consist of numerous small bubbles formed in a liquid. If these bubbles rise and accumulate faster 
than they decay, foaming occurs.1,2 This phenomenon is crucial across various industries, from food and 
bioprocesses1,3 to gas sweetening facilities,4,5 oil refineries,6 and metallurgy.7,8 The selection of materials and 
processes associated with foaming often poses a dilemma. While materials and processes inducing foaming offer 
a larger surface area for reactions or absorption, excessive foaming can lead to issues like liquid knockouts, reduced 
efficiency, and increased capital costs.912 Foaming frequently proves challenging during both the initial conception 
stage and the subsequent scaleup of emerging technologies like carbon capture using liquid solvents.2,1316 Thus, 
managing foaming and identifying essential parameters for foam formation are vital.
