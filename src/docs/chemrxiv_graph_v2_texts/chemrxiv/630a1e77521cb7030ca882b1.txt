Description:
Influences dipole moment distribution, leading to a higher prevalence of the transconformation with a mean dipole moment of 4.13 D.

Text:
This changes upon addition
of TBP or DHOA to a more normal dipole moment distribution with higher prevalence of
the transconformation (Figure S2 and S3) with a range of 3.75  4.25 D and a mean of 4.13
D and 4.09 D in the presence of DHOA and TBP, respectively. 5
