Text:
Formic acid (FA), HCOOH, is the smallest carboxylic acid with pivotal roles in atmospheric,1
prebiotic2,3 and catalytic chemistry.4,5 Its interactions with water, both in the rarefied at
mospheres of earth and on catalytic surfaces, can have profound effects on the resulting
chemistry. FA is also important in astrochemistry, and was recently found to be present in
interstellar ices,6 and can take part in the formation of amino acids such as glycine.7,8 To
date there have been many studies, both experimental and theoretical, including quantum
chemical calculations,4,924 aiming at understanding the mechanisms at play.
