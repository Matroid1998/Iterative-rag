Description:
Tracers used in myocardial imaging.

Text:
As predicted, 201Tl 
initially found widespread use as a myocardial imaging agent until it was replaced by emerging 
technetium99m tracers.3 In a few instances 201TlTlCl has also been employed for tumour 
detection and monitoring.4 Additionally, 201Tl decays through electron capture (EC) to 201Hg, 
emitting an average of 36.9 MeitnerAuger electrons per decay event. MeitnerAuger electron
emitting agents have shown significant potential for application in systemic, targeted 
radionuclide therapy of cancer.5 With its high decay yield of MeitnerAuger electrons, 201Tl 
has promise as a radiotherapeutic isotope and possibly for theranostic applications.6 
The clinical application of 201Tl is currently limited to its use as the free or unchelated metal 
ion. Many other radioactive metallic isotopes have demonstrated clinical utility but are largely 
used in a complexed or chelated form.
