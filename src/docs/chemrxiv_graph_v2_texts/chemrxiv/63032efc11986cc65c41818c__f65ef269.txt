Description:
An aqueous solution used as an electrolyte in batteries, avoiding safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes.

Thus, in this research we studied the properties of NHPIZinc coin battery and found that in acidity adjusted
electrolyte the NHPIZinc battery has nearly 80 columbic efficiency.3 This result highlights the value of organic
radical material in the fibiracation of battery. And the electrolyte used in this system is aqueous zinc sulphate solution,
avoiding the safety hazard caused by organic electrolyte mentioned above.4
