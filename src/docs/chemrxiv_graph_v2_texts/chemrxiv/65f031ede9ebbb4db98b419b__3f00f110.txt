Description:
A graphene-related material that improves flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength.

On the other hand, some other 
methods without introducing the z direction fibres have been proposed to improve the 
interfacial properties, such as addition of nanomaterials (e.g., graphene related materials 4
16, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 14,1619, cellulose 20, MXene 21, etc.) and the chemical 
modification of carbon fibres (CFs) 22,23. In particular, graphene related materials (GRMs), owing to their exceptional mechanical, 
electrical and thermal properties, have been widely investigated 15,16. Some researchers 
decorated CFs with GRMs to improve the interfacial properties, among which the 
electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and fibre sizing methods were used widely. Gangineni et al. 8 studied several GRMs and found that the graphene carboxyl (GCOOH) one performs the 
best, which contributed to 9.6 and 22.9 improvement in flexural strength and interlaminar 
shear strength (ILSS) respectively.
