Description:
Chiral nonracemic compounds important in organic synthesis.

Text:
Much attention has been given in recent years to the preparation of 
enantiopure cyclopropyl compounds because such compounds occur widely in natural 
products1,2 and synthetic pharmaceuticals and their enantiomers often exhibit different 
biological activities3,4. So, the efficient stereoselective synthesis of chiral nonracemic 
cyclopropanes continues to be one of the important tasks in organic synthesis. A variety of 
efficient synthetic methods were reported, of which SimonsSmith reaction and metal
catalysed57 decomposition of diazo compound in the presence of alkenes have been 
known for years. Based on previous studies of Cohen8,9 and Julia10 proposed that Sulfur 
ylides11,12 as a substitute for the potentially explosive, toxic, and carcinogenic diazo 
compounds13 in cyclopropanation.
