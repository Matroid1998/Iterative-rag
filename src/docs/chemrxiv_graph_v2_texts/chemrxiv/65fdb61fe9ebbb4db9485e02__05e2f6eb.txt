Description:
Detected in the interstellar medium in the context of astrochemistry.

Text:
Specifically, the optical
spectrum of Ada has been obtained by electronic photodissociation (EPD) spec
troscopy by Crandall et al. 17 and heliumtagged electronic spectroscopy by Kappe
et al. 18. In addition, the EPD study by Crandall et al. 17 has provided insight
into photoinduced fragmentation of Ada. The optical spectrum of the diamantane
cation, Dia, has also been recently reported by the same group 19. Besides the cations of pristine diamondoids consisting only of carbon and hy
drogen, cations of nitrogencontaining adamantane derivates have received attention
lately 16, 20. In the context of astrochemistry, the interest stems from recent de
tection of aromatic nitriles in the interstellar medium 2123.
