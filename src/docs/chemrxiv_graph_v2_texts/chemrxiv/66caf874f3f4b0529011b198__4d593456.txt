Description:
The precise form and whole body distribution are not well understood.

Some sources, however, infer that the precise form of Gd(III) and
its whole body distribution is still not wellunderstood Wahsner et al. 2019. The evident benet of using manganese is
the biogenic nature of this chemical element. The biological signicance of manganese in mammalian systems was
found for the diverse enzyme families including oxidoreductases, transferases, hydralases and some others Wedler
1993. However, high concentrations of free Mn(II) ions in the human bloodstream are also unacceptable as it may
lead to both incorrect results of MRI diagnostics due to the formation of complexes of Mn(II) with the enzymes (e.g.,
its adduct with human serum albumin (HSA) has considerably higher relaxivity of r1p  54.6 mM1s1 at 0.49 T and
25 C Botar et al.
