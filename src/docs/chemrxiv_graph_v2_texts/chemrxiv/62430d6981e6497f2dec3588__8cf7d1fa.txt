INTRODUCTION 
Siloles have long been known to exhibit redshifted fluorescence properties compared to their 
analogous siliconfree heterocycles due to conjugation between the Si s orbitals and the p 
orbitals of the chromophore.1 However, it wasnt until 2008 that this LUMOlowering effect was 
shown to apply to longwavelength xanthene dyes by replacing the bridging oxygen atom with a 
dimethylsilyl group.2 Sirhodamine dyes have been widely studied and optimized ever since,315 
and the effect of this modification has recently been shown to extend to other classes of nearIR 
dye scaffolds.16,17 Despite this intense interest, and the extension of the bridgesubstitution strategy 
to other elements,3,1822 virtually all Sidyes reported thus far have been confined to dimethyl silyl 
substitution.23 The lone counterexample among Sirhodamines of which we are aware is the work 
of the Stains lab, who constructed a silanolbased sensor that undergoes oxidization to the 
corresponding rhodamine.19 Belying the nearly exclusive reliance on dimethyl silyl bridging 
groups amongst longwavelength Sidyes, a number of silyl substitutions are known within silole 
optical materials.1,2426
