Materials used for magnetic field-based multifunctional applications, including spintronic devices and energy harvesting.

Recent investigations have shown possible applications of 
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) for various 
magnetic fieldbased multifunctional applications. A few 
include 
spintronic 
devices 
with 
antiferromagnetic 
materials, 
antiferromagnetic 
topological 
insulators, 
sensing, and energy harvesting devices 14. A change in 
magnetic behavior is often observed when the bulk 
material is confined to lower dimensions. MerminWagner 
theorem has been set to explain the magnetism in lower 
dimensional materials 5. Accordingly, continuous 
symmetries cannot be broken at finite temperatures in 
systems with sufficiently shortrange interactions in 
dimensions d  2. It means that longrange fluctuations can 
be created with little energy cost, and since they increase 
entropy, 
they 
are 
favoured. Doping, 
layered 
heterostructures, and other techniques can introduce 
magnetism to a material.
