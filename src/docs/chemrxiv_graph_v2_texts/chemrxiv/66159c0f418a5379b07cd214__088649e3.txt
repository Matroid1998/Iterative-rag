Description:
Shows remarkably high ion conductivity that far exceeds 100 mS cm1 in 2030 wt.

Text:
Alkaline ionsolvating membranes combine the high ion conductivity of aqueous hydroxide 
solutions with the good gas barriers characteristics of the polymer phase, which makes it an 
attractive polymer electrolyte system for the next generation alkaline water electrolyzers.1 
Membranes based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) show remarkably high ion conductivity that far 
exceeds 100 mS cm1 in 2030 wt.
