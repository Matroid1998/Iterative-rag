section 
that Cu NCs have garnered significant attention as catalysts 
for electrochemical CO2RR due to their high reactivity and 
unique structural architecture, which can selectively tune 
product formation. In this work, we aim to explore the 
potential of a uniquely designed Cu23 NC as a catalyst for 
CO2RR. To perform the electrochemical measurements, a 
thin film electrode was fabricated using a spray coating 
technique. This involved depositing a slurry of the Cu23 NCs 
and carbon black (CB) onto a carbon paper substrate. It is 
crucial to maintain the geometric and electronic structure 
of the NCs during this loading process to preserve their 
electrocatalytic properties. The stability of the Cu23 NCs 
during this process was assessed using Xray absorption 
fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.

Further 
TEM images confirm the discrete nature of the Cu23 NCs and 
its consistent size even after loading on the CB surface 
(Figures 
4bc). This 
consistent 
structural 
feature 
underscores the preservation of the Cu23 NCs structural 
integrity during the electrode fabrication process, crucial 
for its performance as a CO2RR catalyst. The electrochemical performance of Cu23 NC was 
thoroughly evaluated across a range of constant voltages, 
specifically from 0.6 to 1.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen 
electrode (RHE). This evaluation was conducted using CO2
saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution as the electrolyte 
within a gasflow Htype cell setup. Following the 
electrochemical 
testing, 
an 
indepth 
analysis 
was 
performed utilizing gas chromatography (GC) and 1H NMR 
to characterize the gas and liquid products, respectively.
