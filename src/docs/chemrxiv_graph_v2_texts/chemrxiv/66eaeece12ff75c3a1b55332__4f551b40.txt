Description:
A copolymer used as an active cathode material for LiS batteries.

In order to synthesize
SC copolymers, many researchers have employed the inverse vulcanization reaction as a
facile synthesis method which provides a straightforward way for controlling sulfur content. Among others, sulfurn1,3diisopropenylbenzene (SDIB) copolymer has shown a promising
performance as an active cathode material for LiS batteries.7,8
Structural characterization of SDIB copolymers has been the subject of several studies
so far.6,911 For example, similar to other SC copolymers involving sulfur chains,1218
