Description:
Used in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Text:
Since previous studies have revealed that the applications of MIL(125)NH2 (Ti) in photocatalytic CO2 
reduction, while utilizing CO2 as a feedstock to produce small molecule chemicals, such as CO, CH4, HCOOH and 
CH3OH.1316 However, there is still no report on the CO2 associated selective photocatalytic Nmethylation of 
amines over MOFs.
