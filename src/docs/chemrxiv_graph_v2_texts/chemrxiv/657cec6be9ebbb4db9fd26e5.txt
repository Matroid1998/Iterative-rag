Description:
Absorption property in poly(ionic liquid)s.

Text:
Ionic liquids are molten salts consisting of bulky and
charge delocalized organic cations and organic or in
organic anions.1 When ionic liquid ions are covalently
bound to polymer repeating units, the resultant polymer
is called poly(ionic liquid) or polymerized ionic liquid.2
Poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) combine the unique physico
chemical properties of ionic liquids (e.g., high ionic con
ductivity, CO2 absorption, antimicrobial) with the at
tractive mechanical properties of polymers.3 This has
made PILs appealing materials for various applications,
such as electrolytes in batteries,4 lubricant additives for
coating,5 membranes for molecular separation6 catalysts
for chemical reactions7 as well as stabilizers for particles
in solutions.8 Consequently, understanding the confor
mation of PILs in solution or bulk state is an inevitable
step to control the material properties of PILsbased ma
terials.
