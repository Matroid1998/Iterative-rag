Description:
A compound whose redox properties are enhanced via coordination to Sc(OTf)3.

Text:
Photoredox catalysis requires a catalyst that is both 
photochemically and redox activetypically a 
compound derived from an organic dye or a complex 
of a redoxactive metal, such as ruthenium or iridium 
(see 
Fig. 1a).710 
Conversely, 
redox
inactiveinnocent metals, such as scandium, which 
have a predominantly trivalent redoxstable state, are 
not directly involved in photoredox reactions.1113 
Nevertheless, 
these 
metals, 
and 
particularly 
Sc(OTf)3, can serve as Lewis acids (LA) that activate 
substratesorganophotocatalysts by altering their 
redox characteristics, thereby facilitating their 
participation in photoredox and photosensitisation 
reactions (Figs. 1b and 1c).1215 For instance, the 
redox properties of a flavin derivative (Fl) were 
significantly enhanced via their coordination to 
Sc(OTf)3.

Description:
Participates in a SET process with electron-deficient substrates in an excited Fl2Sc3 complex.

Text:
This alteration enabled the oxidation of 
some electrondeficient substrates via a SET process 
between the substrate and flavin in excited Fl2Sc3 
complex (Fig. 1c, right); such reaction cannot be 
achieved without Sc(OTf)3.16,17 
Notably, the oxophilicity of some Mn cations 
facilitates their binding to superoxide radical anion 
(O2) 
to 
form 
superoxidemetal 
complexes 
(MnO2) that have been recognised within the 
reductive activation of dioxygen by metalloenzymes 
in numerous biological redox reactions that employ 
O2 as an oxidant.1821 This process has been 
mimicked in the dioxygen activation cycle during 
photoredox transformations, commencing with the 
photoinduced single electron transfer (PET) from a 
lightabsorbing, redoxactive compound to O2 and 
followed by the generation of MnO2 complexes 
(Fig. 1d, upper part). Binding of Mn to oxygen 
enhances its ability to accept an electron.
