Description:
A dissolved gas in geothermal fluids that can exsolve with changes in pressure and temperature.

Text:
The design and operation of a geothermal plant are heavily impacted by the phase behavior of the fluids 
extracted from the subsurface. The phase behavior of the aqueous fluid is a function of its composition 
and pressure  temperature conditions. Deep geothermal fluids are often highly saline (6 M) and 
contain dissolved gases (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2). Any change in pressure and temperature across the 
geothermal loop will disturb the existing equilibrium conditions, triggering mineral precipitation and 
gas exsolution until a new equilibrium is achieved.
