Malaria is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with an estimated 247 million 
cases and 619,000 deaths reported in 2021.1 The main epidemic areas of malaria are distributed 
in Africa (96), followed by Southeast Asia (SE Asia) (2) and the Eastern Mediterranean 
Region (2).1 The World Health Organization (WHO) hopes to eliminate malaria in at least 
35 additional countries (based on data from 2021) by 2030.2 
Quinine (Figure 1, 1) was the sole antimalarial drug used since its discovery in the 19th century, 
followed by chloroquine (2).3 However, due to emerging chloroquine resistance, more 
antimalarial drugs such as amodiaquine (ADQ, 3) were discovered.4,5
