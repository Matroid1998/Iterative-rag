Description:
Involved in sulfuric acid cluster formation contributing to NPF.

Text:
New particle formation (NPF) is responsible for the birth of approximately 50 of aerosol
particles formed in the atmosphere,1 and results from the clustering of low volatility gaseous
vapors.2 Acidbase chemistry and salt bridge formation play an important role in stabi
lizing early stage NPF clusters against evaporation, allowing these clusters to grow into
atmospherically relevant sizes.39 Sulfuric acid  ammonia ( water) clusters have previously
been studied in depth1015 as these particles make up a majority of postindustrial revolu
tion NPF contributors.16 However, in midlatitude coastal and polar regional NPF events,
H2SO4  NH3( H2O) cluster formation rates alone could not account for observed NPF
rates.17,18 Further investigation into these regional events led to the discovery that the pres
ence of iodine in these regions helps fuel these NPF events.1922 Coastal algae and other
biota release I2,2326 HOI,27,28 and various organoiodide species, such as CH2I2,20,21,2931
at low tide, which can form various iodine oxoacids23,3236 and iodine oxides19,22,31,32,3742
through photolysis and photooxidation.

Description:
Important in iodine-containing clusters due to its role in acid-base chemistry in early stage NPF clusters.

Text:
Coastal nutrient enhancement, likely due to runoff,
has greatly increased the algae population along with other anthropogenic emissions on and
near the coast of China and has resulted in regionally high iodine concentrations.43 Since
preindustrial times, its believed that there has been a 70 increase in atmospheric iodine.44
Iin sea water in the presence of ample ozone concentrations, can also lead to the formation
and emission of various organoiodide compounds into the atmosphere.4547 During the day,
if concentrations of CH2I2 are in the 10s of ppt range, NPF can take place without any
other contributing species.30 It has even been found that iodine oxoacid nucleation rates are
higher than those of sulfuric acid  ammonia clusters at equal concentrations of acids.48 In
the Arctic, over pack ice, the concentration of iodic acid is 6  10 times higher than that of
sulfuric acid, and as a result NPF events are primarily centered around HIO3, with minimal
to no participation from sulfuric acid or any other species.33
Since acidbase chemistry plays such an important role in these early stage NPF clusters,
the role of ammonia has also been explored in iodine containing clusters as it is important in
