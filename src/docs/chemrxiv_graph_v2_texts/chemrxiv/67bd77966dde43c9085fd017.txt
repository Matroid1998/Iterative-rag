Description:
A compound with potential active sites for Li ion binding, evaluated for energetically favored positions.

Identifying the most favorable alkaliligand binding sites
in susbtrates involves speculating multiple potential binding locations and calculating the
corresponding energies of all possible lithiated structures for comparison.6,8,9 This process
is timeconsuming and prone to overlooking some viable configurations. For example, Kim
et al. identified the energetically favored Li ion positions in 2,6diaminoanthraquinone by
evaluating five potential active sites.6 Similarly, Zhang et al. used simulated annealing cal
culations to explore all possible lithiated structures with lower energies.7 For biomolecular
systems this procedure is even more expensive from a computational standpoint.10 Molec
ular Electrostatic interactions have been identified to play a key role in the ordering of the
binding sites.
