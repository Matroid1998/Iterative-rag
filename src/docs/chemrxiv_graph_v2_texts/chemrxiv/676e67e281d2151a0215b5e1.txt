Description:
A polymer used in solid polymer electrolytes with low ionic conductivity for lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high energy 
density rechargeable Liion batteries (LIBs) due to high 
mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical stability.1 Since the 
discovery of SPEs based on polyethylene oxide (PEO),2 there 
have been various efforts to overcome their low ionic conductivity 
(   103 S cm1). However, low conductivity and Liion 
transference number () still limit the potential of polyetherbased 
SPEs. Since the discovery of polymerinsalt (PIS) SPEs,3 
highly Lisalt concentrated SPEs have provided a new avenue to 
improve  and  of SPEs. Research indicates that, in addition 
to ion diffusion facilitated by polymer segmental motion in saltin
polymer (SIP) SPEs, highly concentrated PIS SPEs exhibit 
additional ion transport pathways, enabling high ionic conductivity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024tjt5s ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000316800996 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
