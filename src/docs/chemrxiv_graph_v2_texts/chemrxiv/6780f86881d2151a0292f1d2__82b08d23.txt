Description:
Induces oxidative stress within cardiac cells by generating excessive ROS, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of apoptotic pathways.

Text:
DOX induces oxidative stress within cardiac cells by generating excessive ROS. This oxidative 
stress damages cellular components, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of 
apoptotic (programmed cell death) pathways. The resultant cell death contributes to the 
deterioration of cardiac function, which can manifest as acute heart failure 11. Consequently, 
the mortality rate following DOX therapy ranges from 10 to 38 after a single or cumulative 
dose of 525 mgkg, and increases significantly to 50 within two years after chemotherapy 
12. To overcome DOXinduced cardiotoxicity, researchers are exploring strategies to counter 
DOXinduced cardiotoxicity, including using antioxidants 13,14, nanotechnology 15, gene 
therapies 16,17, mitochondrial protection strategies 18,19, and adjusting chemotherapy regimens 
20 to reduce cardiac risk, thereby enhancing cardiac defenses.
