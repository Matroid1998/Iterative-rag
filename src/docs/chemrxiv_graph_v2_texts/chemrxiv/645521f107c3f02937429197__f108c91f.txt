Description:
A material used in energy storage, catalysis, and lithium-ion batteries.

Suggested applications of 
ZIF62 glass (agZIF62) include energy storage,11 catalysis12 and 
lithiumion batteries.13 Additionally, the use of agZIF62 as gas 
separation membranes has also been studied, because it retains 50 
of the porosity of crystalline ZIF62 post meltquenching, whilst 
avoiding issues arising from defects and grain boundaries associated 
with membranes composed of polycrystalline materials.11,14,15 
Several studies have focused on combining agZIF62 with other 
materials, such as crystalline MOFs,16 carbon black,13 lead halide 
perovskites17 
and 
organic 
materials 
to 
form 
composite 
membranes.18,19 
Currently, phosphate glasses are of interest to a multitude of industries 
as laser hosts,20 biomaterials,21 proton conductors,22 and in nuclear 
waste immobilisation and remediation.23 Structurally, phosphate 
glasses are based on the network former P2O5 with PO4 building 
blocks interconnected via bridging oxygen atoms (Figure 1c).24,25 
These polyhedra can be described by Qn notation, where n is the 
number of bridging oxygen atoms per tetrahedra.
