Description:
Used as a buffer layer and protection layer in photocathodes for PEC water splitting.

Sb2S3 has been 
employed as a heterojunction partner for WO3 and TiO2 photoanodes for water splitting.8,9 
DeAngelis et al. reported an Sb2S3 photoanode for water splitting yielding photocurrent densities 
exceeding 4 mA cm2, however, very low faradaic efficiencies for oxygen evolution were observed, 
and hence the current obtained was primarily due to photocorrosion.10 
In this work, we report a Sb2S3 photocathode using TiO2 and In2S3 as buffer layers for PEC 
water splitting. Sb2S3 thin films were fabricated using a simple, relatively low temperature 
sulfurization (240C300C) of Sb metal. Phase pure Sb2S3 thin films were obtained and 
photocathodes were fabricated using TiO2 as a buffer layerprotection layer, which yielded high
