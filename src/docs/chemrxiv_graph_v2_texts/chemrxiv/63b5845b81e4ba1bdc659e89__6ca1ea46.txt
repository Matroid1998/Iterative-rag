Description:
A diamine that favors conformations more amenable to aminal formation, hindering cage formation.

of additional amines during the cage selfassembly. Investigation of the prominent 
reaction intermediates and of control reactions found that cage formation was inhibited by the 
preferred formation of aminalbased species. Computational analysis of these intermediates for four 
diamines (DMHDA and three cageforming diamines) found similar qualitative trends in formation 
energies toward cage formation. However, where possible, the aminal species was found to be more 
stable than the imine species. We show that DMHDA favours conformations more amenable to aminal 
formation than the three other diamines. Therefore, we suggest a stronger preference for forming the 
aminal species for DMHDA compared to the other diamines, which hinders cage formation.
