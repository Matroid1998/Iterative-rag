Description:
A key element involved in emission reduction technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage.

Text:
Out of the various
technologies, one of the most promising methods is called Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), or
CO2 capture; it serves as a method for reducing carbon emission by either storing the captured
CO2 in underground geologic formations or repurposing it for constructive applications in fuel
