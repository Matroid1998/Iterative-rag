Compounds that have served as important sources for the production of nitrogen-containing chemicals.

Text:
Nitroaromatics have served as important sources for the production of nitrogencontaining chemicals during the 
past century.5 Recently, the nitrogroup on these compounds had been resurrected as a leaving group by the metal
catalyzed crosscoupling reactions, enriching the chemistry of nitroaromatics.6 However, on another main branch 
of the modern synthesis, these substrates showed an unfavored features for prevailing CH activation in that 1) 
the low electrodensity retards the CH activation, and 2) the weak coordinating ability makes the preactivation 
intermediate unstable.

Description:
Compounds that have undergone rare cases of direct deuteration.

Text:
Despite the recent achievements of their CH functionalizations,7 only rare cases of direct 
deuteration of nitroaromatics have been reported.8 For instance, apart from the first direct deuteration of 
nitroaromatics catalyzed by electronrich Iridium complex (Scheme 1A),9 a recent mechanistic study indicated the 
potential of higher deuteration activity of AgO than Pd(OAc)2.8b The subsequent test with K2CO3 suggested that the 
exchange may happen via a SNAr pathway. This interesting finding encouraged us to hypothesize the electronrich 
silvercomplex could facilitate the HIE of electrodeficient nitroaromatics. Noticeably, similar strategy of silver
