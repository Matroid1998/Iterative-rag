Description:
A flavonoid that inhibited MERSCoV Mpro and SARSCoV1 Mpro.

Text:
After reports about the crystal structure of 
Mpro from SARSCoV2 with an inhibitor 3,4, many attempts to evaluate inhibitors, 
including natural chemicals, have proceeded in in silico study. 55 
Food is a good source for health promotion; it can supply beneficial 
phytochemicals to humans. Thus, the daily consumption of phytochemicals could help 
strengthen our body against diseases, such as COVID19. Formerly, experimental studies 
for the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on the recombinant protease from SARSCoV1 
(classic) or MERSCoV have been reported; some flavonoids, including herbacetin and 
60 
quercetin 3Oglucoside, inhibited MERSCoV Mpro 5. SARSCoV1 Mpro was 
inhibited by flavonoids and flavones, such as herbacetin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, apigenin, 
luteolin, quercetin, and amentoflavone 6,7.

Description:
Shows inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme in vitro.

Concerning SARSCoV2 Mpro, 
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 8,9, theaflavin 8, myricetin 10, quercetin 11, 
herbacetin, pectolinarin, baicalin 12, rutin, baicalein 13, and cyanidin3glucoside 
65 
14 shows inhibitory effects on the enzyme in vitro. Most research was performed by 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, which sometimes results in false 
negatives or positives due to the interference of fluorescence signals derived from test 
chemicals 15; a competitive binding assay using the fluorescent probe 8
anilinonaphthalene1sulfonate is also reported 13. 70 
The study examines the inhibitory effect of food phytochemicals by directly 
measuring the digested peptide substrate after highperformance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) separation.
