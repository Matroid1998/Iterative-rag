Description:
Widely used in adhesives, textiles, and lubricating oils for their flexibility, low glass transition temperature, and tunable hydrophobicity.

Plastics are omnipresent in everyday life due to their ad
vantages (light weight, low cost, and stability under thermal, 
chemical, and mechanical solicitations) but they produce 
large amounts of wastes that accumulate in the environment 
.1, 2 The microplastics generated thereby have become a major 
environmental issue.3, 4 This is especially true for polymers 
having a backbone consisting of carboncarbon bonds, that do 
not allow chemical degradation by hydrolysis. For example, 
polystyrene is a very interesting common plastic due to its 
thermal properties and its resistance to corrosion but it could 
be found intact after 32 years in soil.5 Another example is pol
yacrylates that are widely used in adhesives, textiles and lubri
cating oils for their properties of flexibility, low glass transi
tion temperature and tunable hydrophobicity.
