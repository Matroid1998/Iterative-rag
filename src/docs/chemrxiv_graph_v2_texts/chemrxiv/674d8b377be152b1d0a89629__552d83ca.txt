They can often serve as host structures for both lithium 
and sodiumions making them highly versatile.13 
Hydrogen titanates are a family of metastable materials derived from layered alkali 
titanates.4,5 They are typically synthesized in acidic solution by etching and topotactic 
exchange of the alkali ion in the interlayer space by protons andor water.57 This provides 
them with a high degree of structuralchemical tunability of their nanoconfined interlayer 
composition, comparable to twodimensional Ti3C2Tx MXenes derived via a similar selective 
etching approach.8,9 These materials nanoconfinement environment, in turn, can have an 
effect on their electrochemical ion intercalation properties.1013 
In the layered hydrogen titanate H2Ti3O7, it was found that confined interlayer protons are the 
determining structural feature to enable electrochemical H intercalation.14 This is because 
they separate the titanate layers, allowing to effectively compensate electrochemically 
induced strain by contractionexpansion without altering intralayer structure.14 Interlayer
expansion of layered titanate hollow spheres by confined Mg2 ions was demonstrated as a 
design strategy for electrochemical Na intercalation hosts.15 An investigation into different 
types of confined alkali ions (Li, Na, K, Cs) within lepidocrocitetype layered titanates 
revealed that the interlayer spacing is expanded with increasing ion size (0.68 to 0.85 nm).16 
However, sodiummodified titanate showed the highest capacity for electrochemical Na 
intercalation hosts (153 mAh g1), even though this material has a smaller interlayer spacing 
than the cesiummodified titanate (95 mAh g1), demonstrating the importance of 
nanoconfinement chemistry in addition to just geometrical considerations.16 In the layered 
hydrogen titanate H2Ti2O5 system, it was found that K intercalation can be accomplished most 
efficiently, especially at low temperatures (40 C), for the material with confined interlayer
