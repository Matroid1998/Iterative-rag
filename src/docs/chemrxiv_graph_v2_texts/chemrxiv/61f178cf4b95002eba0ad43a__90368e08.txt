Description:
Used in hypervalent iodine reagents for functionalization of nucleophiles and radicals.

Text:
Hypervalent iodine reagents are now wellestablished for the 
functionalization of nucleophiles under mild conditions due to 
their unique reactivity.1 More recently, they have been also 
successful in the functionalization of radicals. In particular, 
ethynylbenziodoxolone (EBX) reagents have emerged as 
excellent radical traps, enabling the synthesis of alkynes 
otherwise difficult to access (Scheme 1A).2 Efficient access 
toward structurally diverse alkynes is urgently needed, due to 
their numerous applications in synthetic and medicinal 
chemistry, chemical biology and organic materials.3 The 
combination of visiblelight photocatalysis and EBX reagents has 
been especially successful, allowing new processes, such as 
decarboxylative4 or deoxygenative alkynylations,5 as well as 
alkene6 and CH functionalization.7 
In contrast, the direct alkynylation of inert CC bonds is more 
challenging.
