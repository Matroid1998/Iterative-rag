Description:
A chemical element that can be separated from air through physical adsorption.

Text:
Physical adsorption plays an important role across various industrial processes including
separating chemicals (e.g., O2N2 13 or xenon from air 4), radioactive offgases treatment
5, climate change mitigation 6, cooling processes 7, and purification 810. To lower
cost, a key lever is to reduce the energy demand, leading to the ongoing development of new
materials. Porous materials, such as MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs), CovalentOrganic Frame
works (COFs), and zeolites, exhibit extensive design possibilities and have received consid
erable interest for physical adsorption 1113. By systematically exploring this vast design
