Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to more than 20% of total emissions in the EU.

Text:
The reduction of CO2 emissions in the society cannot prescind from a drastic reduction of 
the emissions caused by transportation. Currently, in the European Union (EU), the 
transportation activities (passenger cars and goods transportation) cause more than 20  of the 
total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 1. This makes the reduction of the carbon intensity of 
transportation a key factor to reach the netzero GHG emissions. The electrification of 
transportation is envisaged as the most promising option for the reduction of such emissions 
and several countries declared the intention to phaseout combustion engine vehicles 2. This 
will mainly be achieved by using battery electric vehicles (BEV).
