Text:
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) show desirable photophysical and electronic 
properties, acting as chromophores and functional materials in organic electronics, (bio)imaging, 
and as chemical sensors and catalysts.1 The optical and electronic characteristics can be 
dramatically altered by doping with heteroatoms.1a, 2 For instance, 9,10dihydro9,10dibora
