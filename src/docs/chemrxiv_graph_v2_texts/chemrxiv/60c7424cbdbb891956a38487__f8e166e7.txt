Description:
Transported through cell membranes via ion channels.

Ion channels are an extremely important class of proteins; channels of various types are present in all 
32 
cells, allowing the transport of Na, K, and Ca2 through the cell membrane(1); other channels are 
33 
responsible for transport of other substances, in particular protons(2, 3). Channels have even been 
34 
found in viruses(4, 5). Voltage gated ion channels (VGIC) are a particular class of channels, and certain 
35 
types of these are responsible for the nerve impulse, as well as the properties of other excitable tissue(6
36 
8). VGIC, both for Na and K, have four voltage sensing domains (VSD); for the K channels, these 
37 
are identical, while for Na they are similar (one having a different function).
