Description:
Nanoparticles that can undergo oxidation at high temperatures.

Text:
Oxidation of carbon nanoparticles (NPs) at high temperatures is 
relevant to many applications of carbon nanomaterials, but there 
are also interesting fundamental questions relating reactivity to NP 
surface structure, which can vary dramatically for different carbon 
materials (graphitic, diamond, fullerene, etc. ).12 Even for a 
particular type of carbon NP, there can be large NPtoNP 
variations in the number and types of exposed surface sites, 
strongly affecting the rates of processes such as sublimation or 
oxidation.3 Finally, even for a single NP, the surface structure may 
evolve during reaction, resulting in large rate variations.

Description:
A key element in various forms, including graphite, that undergoes oxidation.

Surprisingly, it was also found that graphitic NPs eventually 
evolved to be essentially inert to O2 in the 1200 to 1900 K range, 
implying that the number of exposed reactive sites dropped to near 
zero. It was speculated that his evolution to O2 inertness resulted 
from a transformation of at least the surface layer, to nanoonion 
(multiwall fullerene) structure. This interpretation of the previous results, as well as results 
presented below, relies on extensive literature on oxidation of 
various forms of carbon, particularly graphite, some of which is 
discussed in the SI.
