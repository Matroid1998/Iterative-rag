Extensively employed in heating and power generator systems.

Methane (CH4) is a strong greenhouse gas exhibiting a global warming capacity exceeding thirty 
times that of carbon dioxide (CO2). 1 CH4 is extensively employed in numerous applications 
including heating and power generator systems. Today, the dismiss of unburnt CH4 into the 
atmospheric air mainly from transport and industrial activities using natural gas is responsible of 
severe environmental issues. 2 Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to decrease the emission of CH4 
into the environment and catalytic combustion stands as prominent applied remediation technic to 
convert CH4 into CO2 and H2O known as a less harmful species. To date, total oxidation of CH4 by 
heterogeneous catalysis not only enables the drastic reduction of reaction temperatures but also 
limits SOx, NOx and CO emissions.
