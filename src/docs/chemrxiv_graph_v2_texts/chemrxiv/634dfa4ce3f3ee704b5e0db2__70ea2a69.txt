While molecular reaction modeling has assisted in generating plausible transition states for some
9
of the involved conversions, predictive explorations of prebiotic reactions are still in their infancy
10
due to a combination of the computational cost and limited accuracy of contemporary reaction
11
network exploration algorithms. 12
Over the past few decades, molecular modeling has provided details on plausible intermediates
13
and transition states associated with producing a variety of RNA and protein precursors (Fig. 14
1a). The history of computational modeling leading to focusing on HCN as an important prebiotic
15
reactant is illustrative of the slow process of ad hoc reaction pathway proposals and characteriza
16
tions. In 2007, Debjani et al.

Description:
Used in reaction pathways to synthesize a formamide trimer.

Text:
reported a pathway for synthesizing an HCN pentamer, adenine,
17
from the HCN tetramer, AICN.16 This observation triggered a search for even simpler reactants. 18
Among the important milestones along the way, Sponer et al. derived the reaction pathway for
19
adenine formation from a simple formamide dimer, N(Aminohydroxymethyl) formamide,17 and
20
later Wang et al. used formamide as an even simpler starting point using watercatalyzed and
21
autocatalyzed reaction mechanisms (orange box in Fig. 1a).18,19 Finally in 2016, Kua et al re
22
ported reaction pathways starting from HCN, NH3 and H2O to synthesize a formamide trimer,
23
1,3,5triazinane2,4,6triol (blue box in Fig. 1a).20 This abbreviated history, spanning 10years
