Description:
A cofactor involved in enzyme-dependent radical chemistries.

Text:
Recently, several classes of enzymes have been shown to be able to control nonnative 
radical chemistries, such as enereductases (EREDs) by the Hyster group,13 pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP)
dependent enzymes by the Yang group (Figure 1D),14 and other examples.1522 These strategies typically 
rely on light to generate radicals, either by accessing excited states of cofactors (e.g. flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN) in EREDs), or by supplying an exogenous photocatalyst.
