Description:
Used as an adhesive layer between Au and dielectric layers in MIM structures.

We have realized a perfectabsorberemitter using MIM structures by intricate tune of
absorbtion via scattering of MIM structures by increasing abs in respect to sca8,9. This was achieved by increasing a thickness
of Cr lm used as an adhesive layer between the Au and dielectric layers, hence, favoring the absorbance contribution. For thermal emitters at a designed IRband, choice of materials for MIM patterns becomes important since more emission
can be obtained at elevated temperatures. In this regard, when Au and Cr are stacked and heated, Cr will quickly diffuse into
Au, destroying the MIM structure and degrading optical properties. Therefore, we focused on searching for homogeneous
metallic materials with strong absorption.
