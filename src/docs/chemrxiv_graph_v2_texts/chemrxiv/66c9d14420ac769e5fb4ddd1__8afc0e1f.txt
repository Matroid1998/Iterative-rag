Natrolite, Na2(Si3Al2)O102H2O, is a mineral that was named by M. H. Klaproth, 1803, from Greek 
natron, for its sodium content and lithos, that is stone (Strekeisen, 2020). Natrolite is the 
representative member of a group of zeolites, where zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals 
made from interlinked tetrahedra of alumina (AlO4) and silica (SiO4) (Strekeisen, 2020). The origin 
of the name zeolite, as reported by Strekeisen, is very interesting too. It is told that the term zeolite 
was proposed by A. F. Cronstedt in 1756, since he observed that upon rapidly heating the material 
stilbite, it produced large amounts of steam (Strekeisen, 2020). Therefore, Cronstedt used Greek 
zeo, to boil, and lithos.
