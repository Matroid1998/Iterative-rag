Description:
Metals that form alkyl derivatives with high polarization and electropositive character.

Text:
Alkyl derivatives of alkaline earth (AE) and rare earth metals (RE) are highly desirable 
synthons of great utility in synthetic transformations and as organometallic starting materials.1
4 The chemistry of AE and RE alkyl is dominated by the high polarization of the MC 
interaction, which makes the carbanion extremely nucleophilic.1,4,5 This aspect, combined with 
the high electropositive character of the AE and RE metals, has a detrimental effect on the 
stability of alkyl derivatives, leading often to facile decomposition via inter and intra
molecular CH activation,  and hydride elimination, solvent degradation and more.1,5 To 
counter these drawbacks, several strategies can be employed, which include 1) kinetic 
saturation of the metal coordination sphere; 2) chelation; 3) hyperconjugation to stabilize the 
methanide carbanion, CR3.6 Iminophosphoranomethanide ligands of the type (R
NP(Ph)2)2CH (RBIPMH, R  trimethylsilyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, aryl) combine all of 
these aspects, and as a result have been used extensively to prepare alkaline earth (AE)715 and 
rare earth (RE) methanide complexes (Figure 1),16 e.g.
