Description:
Common moieties in many drug candidates, postulated to have a chiral bioisostere in sulfonimidamides.

Sulfur (VI) functional groups such as sulfonamides and sul
fones have a rich history of impacting human life through me
dicinal and agrochemical applications. Their corresponding, 
largely untapped, chiral sulfur (VI) pharmacophores have re
cently emerged as targets of interest in medicinal chemistry.1 
As examples, sulfoximines,2 sulfondiimines,3 and sulfonimid
amides4 (Figure 1A) offer attractive properties for pharmaceu
tical applications chirality, stability, solubility, desirable phys
icochemical characteristics, hydrogen bonding propensity, and 
multiple sites to incorporate structural diversity.5 Specifically, 
sulfonimidamides have been postulated to be a chiral bi
oisostere to carboxylic acids6 and sulfonamides,7, 8 common 
moieties in many drug candidates. However, this motif has yet 
to be widely deployed due to limited commercial availability 
and a dearth of practical asymmetric synthetic methods.
