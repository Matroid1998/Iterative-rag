Description:
An example of a compound used in the design of anionophores for transmembrane anion transport.

Text:
The discovery of transmembrane anion transporters continues 
apace1 driven by the potential application of these compounds 
in the treatment of diseases such as cancer2 and cystic fibrosis.3 
A successful strategy to design anionophores is to append 
hydrogen bond donor groups to a lipophilic scaffold. Examples 
include cholapods,4 orthophenylenes,5 transdecalins,6 and 
anthracenes.7 We have previously shown that there is an 
optimal log P for each class of anion transporter.8,9 Compounds 
with a low log P value may not be able to efficiently partition 
into a lipid bilayer whilst compounds with a high log P may not 
be deliverable and instead need to be preincorporated into a 
lipid bilayer to study their transport properties.
