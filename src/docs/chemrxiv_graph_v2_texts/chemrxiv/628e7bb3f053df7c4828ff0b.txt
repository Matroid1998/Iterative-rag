Description:
Known for metallic electrical conductivity, superior flexibility, and mechanical strength.

Furthermore, twodimensional transition metal carbides, 
also known as MXenes, are drawing increasing attention in 
numerous application fields due to their similar advantages to 
graphene (e.g., metallic electrical conductivity, superior 
flexibility and mechanical strength, and diversity of surface 
functional groups).4144 Over the past decade, MXenes have 
been extensively studied in the energy storage arena as bulk 
materials, in fewlayered forms, as well as in pure phase and 
composites.4345 
Among those, layeredfewlayered MXenes provide a much 
larger specific surface area, improved flexibility, and often form 
superior composites (i.e., better contacting or interface 
between phases) when compared with bulk MXenes.46, 47 
Hence, fewlayered MXenes have been applied to composites 
with a variety of materials for improved performance, including 
MOFs48, metal oxides49, and metal chalcogens.50, 51
