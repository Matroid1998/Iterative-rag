Description:
A type of amorphous carbon electrode used in synthetic organic transformations.

Text:
However, due to the prohibitive cost of noble metals, alternative inert electrodes, such 
as carbonbased materials, are preferred.6,8 In fact, carbonbased electrodes have 
been used in over 50 of synthetic organic transformations since the early 2000s.6 
On bench scale, amorphous carbon electrodes (reticulated vitreous carbon, RVC or 
glassy carbon, GC) are widely employed while their use in largescale is limited (Figure 
1A). This limitation became apparent to us when studying the Kolbe reaction  a useful 
reaction to access a variety of highvalue chemicals from simple carboxylic acids  
enabled by rapid alternating polarity (rAP) reliant on amorphous carbon electrodes
