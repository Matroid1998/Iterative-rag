Description:
Groups on PSS that act as ion-transporting moieties.

Several previous studies have successfully used these devices to 
monitor heartbeat, brain activity, and electrophysiology in real time.1416 
An important aspect of aqueous operation is the stability of the film, and the dissolution or 
delamination of OMIEC films must be avoided. Owing to the nature of OMIECs, the ion 
transport moieties are located in the hydrophilic part basically. For example, in the well
known mixed conductor poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrene sulfonate) 
(PEDOTPSS), the sulfonate (SO3) groups on the PSS act as iontransporting moieties, 
which stabilize the colloidal particles in commercially available PEDOTPSS water 
dispersions.1719 Crosslinkers are commonly used to stabilize these films against 
dissolution and delamination of the films by a chemical reaction.
