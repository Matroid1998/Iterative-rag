Description:
An amino acid that acts as a nucleophile in cysteine proteases, facilitating proteolysis.

Text:
One of the possible strategies to fight against COVID19 is the development of compounds 
able to inhibit the activity of one of the essential enzymes of the SARSCoV2 virus. In this 
sense, one of the most attractive targets is the main protease of the virus, also known as 
3CLpro. This enzyme is a cysteine protease in charge of the proteolysis of the polyproteins 
produced after translation of its genome in the infected cells.1 Inhibition of this essential 
enzyme results in the inability of the virus to produce its nonstructural proteins, interrupting 
its replication cycle.

Description:
A catalytic amino acid residue involved in the activity of certain proteases.

Text:
As an additional advantage, this protease uses a recognition sequence 
not known in any of the human proteases, decreasing the risk of side effects after the 
administration of these compound.2 Some of the compounds reported to have inhibitory 
capacity against SARSCoV2 3CLpro are covalent inhibitors that contain an electrophilic site 
able to react with the catalytic cysteine, Cys145.37
