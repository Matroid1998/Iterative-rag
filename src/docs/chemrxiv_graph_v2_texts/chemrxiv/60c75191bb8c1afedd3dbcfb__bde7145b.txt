Text:
Gallium nitride (GaN) is a group 13Nitride semiconductor of high importance to 
modern electronic devices due to its optical and electronic properties. GaN has a direct and 
wide bandgap of 3.4 eV, a high breakdown field of 5 MV cm1, high electron mobility 
(theoretical limit 3200 cm2Vs), high electron saturation velocity (theoretical limit 
3.15107 cms), and high thermal stability (melting point of 2500 C).12 These properties 
make GaN important for high power and highfrequency electronics and optoelectronics. The fabrication of any electronic device requires the deposition of the material as a thin 
film.
