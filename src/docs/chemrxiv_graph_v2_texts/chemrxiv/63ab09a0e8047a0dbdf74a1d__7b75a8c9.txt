Description:
A dopant used in commercial catalysts for selective catalytic reduction to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.

Text:
Typical commercial metal oxide catalysts extensively applied in the industry usually consist
of a catalytic layer on a support. The catalytic performance of the oxide layer can be
further improved by mixing a certain portion of guest elements into the host oxide through
doping, which leads to changes in the electronic structures and chemical bonds within the
catalyst.1 One of the most widely employed dopants in commercial catalysts for the selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction to reduce nitrogen oxide emission is tungsten, as realized
in WO3V2O5TiO2 (anatase).2,3 The role of tungsten doping in improving the catalytic
performance is still controversially discussed. Based on spectroscopy experiments, Peng et

Description:
Doping with tungsten increases Br√∏nsted acid sites on catalyst layers.

Text:
proposed that the increased concentration of Brnsted acid sites (VOH) on catalyst layer
by tungsten doping facilitates NH3 adsorption.4 On the other hand, more recent infrared
spectroscopic studies5,6 suggested that the terminal vanadyl groups, which act as Lewis acid
sites, are crucial for stronger ammonia adsorption. Indeed, in a previous theoretical study,7
we have shown that the addition of tungsten can lead to nonstoichiometric surfaces and the
occurrence of unsaturated terminal vanadyl groups.

Description:
Stabilizes the anatase phase of the TiO2 support, extending the operation time of the catalyst with high activity.

Text:
Yet, both theory and experiment agree
that a proper amount of tungsten stabilizes the anatase phase of the TiO2 support thus
extending the operation time of the catalyst with a high activity.7,8 Still, although tungsta
vanadia catalysts exhibit an outstanding catalytic activity in the temperature window of
300400C, the low NO conversion rate at lower temperatures and the poor selectivity at
high temperatures are still challenging issues. Therefore, numerous eorts have focused on
the widening of the operation temperature range of SCR catalysts, which is closely related
to adjusting the redox properties and the acidity of catalysts.911
Among various possibilities, introducing new doping elements is one of the most promising
