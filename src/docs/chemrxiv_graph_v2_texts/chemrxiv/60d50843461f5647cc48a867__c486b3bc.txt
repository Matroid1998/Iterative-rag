Description:
Forms stable complexes with PNs as electron releasing substituents.

Text:
In the case of a terminally 
bound PN where the (PNM) angle approaches 180o, 
the PN moiety can serve as a 5 electron donor engaging 
in bonding with the metal center in two orthogonal 
planes, akin to imido ligands.34 The effectiveness of PNs 
as electron releasing substituents or donors has been ex
ploited in the synthesis of phosphazene superbases and 
stable complexes of strongly oxidizing ions such as 
Ce(IV) and Tb(IV), respectively.57 As ligands, PNs also 
enable the generation of reactive, lowcoordinate metal 
fragments via the incorporation of stericallyencumbering 
substituents on the phosphorus atom.
