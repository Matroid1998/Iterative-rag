Description:
A metal added to Cu-based catalysts to improve glycerol conversion.

Text:
Additionally, Cubased catalysts can 
be further modified by incorporating other metals or promoters, such as nickel,15 
chromium,16 aluminum,17 zinc,18 and silica,19 to improve glycerol conversion, 
increase selectivity to PDO, and enhance catalyst stability. Cubased catalysts exhibit between 
51100 conversion of glycerol with selectivity up to 76100 towards 1,2PDO at 180230 
 and 1518 bar pressure ranges.7,1214 The conversion was observed to decrease at higher 
concentration of glycerol in the reactant mixture. The optimal reaction conditions for Cubased 
catalysts, such as temperature and pressure, can vary depending on the specific catalyst 
composition and support. Therefore, finding the right conditions, support and promoters to 
maximize both glycerol conversion and selectivity to 1,2PDO is an ongoing challenge.
