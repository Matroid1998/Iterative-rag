Likewise, in metalair batteries, the ORR governs the discharge 
mechanism, significantly impacting the energy density, cycle life, and coulombic efficiency. Developing highperformance catalysts for ORR is critical to addressing the escalating global 
demand for clean, sustainable, and costeffective energy solutions, especially in the context of 
accelerating the transition to renewable energy and decarbonized energy systems. Historically, noble metals, particularly platinum (Pt) and its alloys, have set the benchmark for 
ORR catalysis due to their exceptional activity and selectivity 7. However, their limitations, 
including exorbitant costs, scarcity, and susceptibility to poisoning by reaction intermediates, have 
catalyzed the search for earthabundant alternatives 8. Transition metal complexes, particularly 
Ni (II) and Co (II) Schiff base complexes, have emerged as promising candidates for nonprecious 
metal catalysts.
