Description:
A natural compound extracted from turmeric, used as a spice or food additive due to its intense orange color.

Text:
Curcumin (CURC) is a natural compound,1 which is extracted 
from turmeric (curcuma longa)2 and is widely used as spice or 
food additive. The latter is also due to its intense orange colour, 
which makes curcumin particularly attractive for the food 
processing industry. More recently the interest in CURC also 
concerns its remarkable properties as antinflammatory and 
antibacterial drugs.1,37 Furthermore, it has been recently 
confirmed that curcumin exerts an important anticancer 
activity,810 which has further revived the pharmacological 
interest towards this natural compound.

Description:
A natural occurring nontoxic spice with potential for photodynamic therapy and light assisted chemotherapy.

In addition, curcumin 
absorbing in the visible light, the possible exploitation of its 
excited state manifold for photodynamic (PDT) or light assisted 
chemotherapy (LAC) have also been investigated.11,12 In 
particular, exploiting CURC, a natural occurring nontoxic spice, 
for PDT aimed at food processing and its antibacterial treatment 
is particularly attractive. Other analogue components of 
turmeric such as cyclocurcumin, have also been highlighted for 
their possible photophysical and photochemical properties.4,13

However, to ensure the efficiency of PDT, which is based on the 
activation of molecular oxygen to its reactive singlet state 1O2, 
crucial photophysical conditions should be reunited. In 
particular, a high intersystem crossing (ISC), leading to a fast and 
efficient population of the photosensitizer triplet state manifold 
is required.
