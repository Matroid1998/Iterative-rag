Description:
A base that stabilizes sulfuric acid clusters in the atmosphere.

Text:
However, bases such
as ammonia, amines, and diamines have been shown to stabilize atmospherically relevant
sulfuric acid clusters, thereby accelerating growth.1727 Proton transfer between sulfuric acid
and bases leads to stabilization by a balance between Coulombic forces and hydrogen bonds
in the clusters.24
Organic molecules have been identified as key players in both the nucleation and growth
