Description:
Serves as the catalyst in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

Generally 
speaking, a lightresponsive activity can be either irreversible or reversible, depending on whether the 
chromophore is connected to the chain end or the polymeric backbone. Most frequently, lightresponsive 
polymers characteristics are adjusted by the employment of photochromic molecules.12The atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP), which was initially identified by Matyjaszewski3and Sawamoto4is of 
tremendous interest. It is one of the most widely used controlledliving radical polymerization techniques 
that produces polymers with narrow polydispersities and welldefined molecular weights. An alkyl halide 
(RX) or pseudohalide serves as the catalyst in ATRP, while a transition metal complex (such as Cu, Ru, 
Os, Mo, or Fe) acts as the initiator.57 ATRP entails the reversible deactivation of the propagating chain
