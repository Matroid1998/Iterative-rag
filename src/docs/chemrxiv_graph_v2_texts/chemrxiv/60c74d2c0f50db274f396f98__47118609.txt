Description:
Functionalized polymer chains with embedded dipoles.

, we rst probed the inuence of anion type
and nanoparticle volume fraction on conductivity. Our coarsegrained model distinguishes
ions only on the basis of their size, neglecting the specic inuence of their chemistry. Ac
cordingly, we consider two dierent anion sizes, anion  2.0  and 1.5 , where  denotes
the size of the monomer both in the polymer chains and in the oligomeric solvent. The
cation size (cat) for this set of results was chosen to be 0.5  to represent Li.18 To mimic
polyethylene oxide and tetraglyme as the functionalized polymer chains and oligomeric sol
vent host,15,16 the strength of the embedded dipole in their respective monomers was xed
to be that of an ethylene oxide (EO) monomer (  EO) at 373 K.
