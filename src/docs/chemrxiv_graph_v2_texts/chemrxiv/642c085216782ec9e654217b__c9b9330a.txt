Description:
Compounds that react with organometallic species such as Grignard reagents.

Text:
Several strategies have been reported over the 
years.36 The first one involves the addition of highly reactive 
organometallic species such as Grignard reagents on 
trialkoxyboranes and subsequent addition of a diol,3 however, 
although effective, this approach suffers from an easy 
1,3metallotropic shift of the organometallic species, which 
leads to a mixture of the linear and the branched 
allylboranes, thus limiting this method to the simplest 
allylboronic esters. Since the mid90s and the pioneering 
work of Miyaura4 and Ito5 on the palladium and copper
catalyzed borylation of allylic acetates (Figure 1. A), the 
development of transition metalcatalyzed borylation of 
allylic derivatives has tremendously facilitated the synthesis 
of these compounds.
