Description:
An element optimized for sensitization and absorption to achieve high brightness in photophysical mechanisms.

To overcome this drawback, Weissman discovered in 
the early 40s an indirect sensitization mechanism mediated by 
a coordinated ligand able to absorb efficiently light and transfer 
the energy to the emitting metal ion.15 
This intramolecular energy transfer is referred to as the 
antenna effect, following Lehn and Sabbatini studies on the 
trisbipyridine 
cryptate 
europium 
complex.16 
Several 
sensitization photophysical mechanisms have been proposed 
involving either the triplet excited state of the antenna or a direct 
energy transfer from the singlet one.17 The optimization of the 
antenna effect for a given lanthanide ion consists of 
simultaneously optimizing the sensitization process () and the 
absorption at the wavelength of interest (), leading in fine to 
the highest possible brightness B(1)  ..
