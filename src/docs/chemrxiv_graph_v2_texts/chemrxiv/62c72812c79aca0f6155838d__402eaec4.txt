Description:
Used for amino protection in ON deprotection.

Text:
However, it is documented that UV light can damage ON.10 Using allyl and benzyl based 
groups for amino protection, ON deprotection can be achieved using palladium. However, excess palladium 
has to be used, and palladium is toxic, difficult to remove, and expensive.11 The (pnitrophenyl)ethyl (Npe) 
and (pnitrophenyl)ethyloxycarbonyl (Npeoc) groups were studied for ON synthesis, but deprotection of 
these groups requires the strong base DBU with a nucleophilic scavenger.12 Several other methods in the 
literature can also be considered for sensitive ON synthesis, which are summarized elsewhere.13 Again, all 
of them have limitations.
