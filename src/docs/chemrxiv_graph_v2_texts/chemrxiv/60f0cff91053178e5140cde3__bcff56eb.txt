The push for global sustainability is ultimately linked to the electrification of the chemical industry 
as it shifts away from fossilfuel consuming thermochemical routes13. There is current a strong emphasis 
placed on water electrolysis and CO2 reduction, and as a direct result from these efforts these technologies 
are maturing to economic competitiveness47. Apart from this, electrochemical routes must also be 
developed to take advantage of abundant feedstocks, including methane8, biomass platforms9,10, and excess 
organics like acetonitrile, which is the focus of this work. Acetonitrile is typically generated as a byproduct 
in acrylonitrile production (produced at a scale of 5 million tons per year) and most of it is burned 
afterwards, generating NOx species in the process11.

Description:
An organic solvent and building block in organic synthesis.

Text:
Its uses are primarily as an organic solvent and building 
block in organic synthesis, but its production far outweighs its demand (1020 thousand tons per year). Against this backdrop, the development of renewable energypowered electrocatalytic routes to convert 
acetonitrile into societally useful chemicals stands to make a substantial impact in the transition to 
sustainable society.
