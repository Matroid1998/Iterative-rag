Description:
Exhibits better magnetic properties due to a larger CpDyCp angle and shorter CpDy bond lengths.

Recently, Harvey and Long et al.8 have systematically 
studied the subtle perturbation of local environment and the 
magnetic properties of a series of dysprosium metalloceniums. This work gives a reasonable illustration that the better 
magnetic properties for CpiPr5DyCp cation6c comparing to 
the others can be attributed to the larger CpDyCp angle and 
shorter CpDy bond lengths. Most of the related researches 
focused on evaluating the magnetostructural correlations 
qualitatively on account of the complicated factors, either for 
3d,11 4f,8,12,13 or 5fbased SMMs.14 Up till now, it is still a big 
challenge to clarify the magnetostructural correlations even in 
a qualitative perspective, not to speak of a concisely semi
quantitative 
or 
quantitative 
evaluation 
supported 
by 
experiments directly.
