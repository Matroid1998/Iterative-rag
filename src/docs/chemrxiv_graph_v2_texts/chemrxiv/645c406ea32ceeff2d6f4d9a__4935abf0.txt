Description:
Used in CN bond formation as a derivative.

Likewise, Mu
sacchio and coworkers reported only a single example of CN 
bond formation using a pyrazole derivative;25 they have since 
expanded this catalyst platform to include secondary benzylic 
and tertiary benzylic and aliphatic C(sp3)H azolations.23 
In our original report, inclusion of NEt33HF was necessary 
in order to obtain high yields of C(sp3)H functionalization 
(even for nonfluoride nucleophiles), likely because this addi
tive accelerated singleelectron reduction and decarboxylation 
of Nacyloxyphthalimide with excitedstate Ir(pFppy)3, af
fording higher concentrations of the HAT reagent (methyl rad
ical). However, we found that NHnucleophiles such as sulfon
amides and amides were deactivated by competitive hydrogen 
bonding with the NEt33HF additive. Hydrogen bonding to the 
NHnucleophile also inhibited methyl radical generation from 
Nacyloxyphthalimide, NEt33HF and Ir(pFppy)3.
