Description:
Part of a radical where unpaired electron delocalizes across its fused ring.

Text:
The radical was first synthesized by Blat
ter in 1968.5 Later, several new synthetic strategies were developed by researchers for the
easy synthesis of a library of the related superstable radicals.6,7 As described in our previous
works, an extensive unpaired spin delocalization accompanied by delocalized SOMO makes
the radical superstable in nature.8,9 The spindensity distribution (shown in Figure 1b) re
veals the unpaired electron for Blatters radical is not only confined to three Natoms but
delocalizes across both the triazinyl and fused benzene ring.
