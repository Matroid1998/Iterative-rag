Description:
A functional group that can undergo cleavage or reaction to form AuC bonds.

Text:
In addition to dative anchor groups, covalent anchors have been reported to yield stable 
and highly conductive molecular junctions11. However, direct formation of AuC covalent 
bonds in molecular junctions is challenging and typically requires cleavage or reaction of 
functional groups such as iodine12, alkyne13,14, or diazonium15,16 to generate AuC bonds 
through in situ reactions. Recently, oriented external electric fields17,18 have gained 
increasing attention for their ability to reorganize the electron distribution of molecules, 
stabilize chargeseparated resonant forms, and promote nonredox reactions19.This prior 
work suggests that it may be possible to form dynamic anchors in nanoscale junctions 
under external electric fields without the need for cleavage of functional groups, which 
could provide a new molecular junction binding mechanism for single molecule 
electronics.
