Description:
A better oxidant and reductant in the excited state, important for photocatalysts in photoredox processes.

Text:
For example, Ru(2,2bipyridine)2 is both a better 
oxidant and better reductant in the excited state, and this 
characteristic is an important feature of the photocatalysts used 
in photoredox processes.4, 6, 1214 
Depending on the nature of the orbitals involved in the 
electronic transition (i.e. bonding, antibonding or nonbonding), 
excitation may strengthen or weaken bonds in the complex and 
lead to chemical reactivity. A classic example of this 
phenomenon is photoinduced CO dissociation from metal 
carbonyl complexes (e.g., M(CO)6, M  Cr, Mo, W).1520 In this 
case, absorption of a photon promotes a transition from an 
orbital that is bonding to an orbital that is antibonding with 
respect to the dative bond.
