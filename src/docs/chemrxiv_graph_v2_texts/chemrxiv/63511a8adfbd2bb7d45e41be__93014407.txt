Description:
Used in combination with an appropriate ketoaldehyde in conventional two electron mechanisms.

While such 
processes have been developed employing conventional two electron mechanisms,7,8 
they are currently limited to the use of 1,3diketones in combination with an 
appropriate ketoaldehyde. As a more general approach, the 1,4diketone may be
