Composed of the surface after catalysis.

Previous reports on 
NiP alloys found passivation regimes through anodic polarization in nearneutral pH electrolytes below 
0.2 V vs. SCE but saw further corrosion after polarizing towards more anodic potentials.13,14 Bulk nickel 
phosphides, however, have been shown to have a passivated surface, and characterization, often limited 
to exsitu spectroscopy after catalysis, has shown that the surface is composed of nickel hydroxides, 
phosphates, and oxyhydroxides.13,15,16 In the present work, operando Ni Kedge Xray absorption
