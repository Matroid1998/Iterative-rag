Description:
Forms a phosphorescent organometallic compound used for cation sensing.

Given the exponential nature of decay time,
this separation could be made arbitrarily large at a mod
est efficiency cut. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one in
stance of such fluotophospho sensing mechanism in the
literature. In that example, the coordination of a fluo
rescent organic ligand to a cationic analyte (Pt2), form
ing a phosphorescent organometallic compound, is used
for cation sensing 28. Unfortunately, this elegant strat
egy, ideally suited for some transition metal ions that
form phosphorescent molecular complexes, cannot be ex
tended to biologically relevant ions such as Na, K or
Mg2, or to Ba2 sensing, as these metals do not form
luminescent complexes.
