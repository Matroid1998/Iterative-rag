Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis.

Text:
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two 
key reactions in a water electrolyser. Understanding the mechanisms of HER and OER is 
necessary to improve the energy efficiency of green hydrogen production via water splitting.
