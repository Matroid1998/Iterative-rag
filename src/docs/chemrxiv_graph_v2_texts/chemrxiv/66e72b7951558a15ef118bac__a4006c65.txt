Description:
A material with high hardness, high thermal stability, high chemical resistance, and low density.

Text:
The thickness of the deposition must be meticulously regulated to ensure that 
the CNT pores remain unobstructed and to achieve uniform surface coverage. The standard film 
deposition technique for highly conformal thin film deposition onto topographically complex 
surfaces is atomic layer deposition (ALD),31,32 which is based on sequential, selflimiting 
surface chemical reactions. Due to its high hardness, high thermal stability, high chemical resistance, and lowdensity,33 
boron carbide stands out as a material of great interest for encapsulating carbonaceous 
materials. It has been reported that thin film deposition of boron carbide can improve the
