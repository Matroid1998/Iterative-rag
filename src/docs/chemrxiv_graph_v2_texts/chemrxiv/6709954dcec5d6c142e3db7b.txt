Description:
Forms vacancies in doped PCFC oxide electrolytes to maintain electrical neutrality.

Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are expected to exhibit high power generation efficiencies. As previously reported, doping is a key process in achieving high proton conductivities in PCFC 
oxide electrolytes.16 More specifically, doping with lowvalence elements creates oxygen 
vacancies that maintain electrical neutrality, and these vacancies can subsequently be filled with 
hydroxy groups to introduce protons into the system. Previously, the relationship between the 
conductivity and the doping level has been studied experimentally.7,8 However, to understand the 
mechanism of proton conductivity from a microscopic viewpoint, atomistic simulations based on 
molecular dynamics are essential,9,10 and stable atomistic configurations are required to commence 
these simulations.
