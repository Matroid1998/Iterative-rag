Description:
A semiconductor nanowire with strong spin-orbit coupling used in research on Majorana Zero Modes.

Text:
Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) are an active area of research into potentially nonAbelian
quantum states which some authors suggested could offer a degree of protection for de
coherence in specially designed quantum computing architectures.13 MZMs manifest as
zeroenergy midgap states localized at boundaries and topological defects within one and
twodimensional topological superconductors.4 One heavily researched platform for realiz
ing MZMs involves proximity coupling a conventional superconductor, most commonly Al
and Nbbased alloys, with a semiconductor nanowire with strong spinorbit coupling (SOC),
such as InAs or InSb.

Description:
A semiconductor used in hybrid nanowire systems to improve electron mobility.

Text:
The realization of MZMs typically requires external magnetic field or
another form of broken symmetry.58 Recently, advancements have been made in material
selection and experimental techniques in such semiconductornanowiresuperconductor sys
tems, addressing challenges identified during initial experimental efforts that did not yield
a clear evidence of MZMs.911 Approaches include investigating different combinations of
semiconductors such as InAs and InSb and superconductors, such as Pb, Sn, Nb, which aim
to improve electron mobility and harness larger superconducting gaps and higher critical
magnetic fields.1216
A challenge of the semiconductorsuperconductor hybrid nanowire configuration is that
excessive coupling between the superconducting metal and semiconductor can lead to the
metallization of the semiconductor, which could hinder achieving the desired topological
phase in experimental setups.
