Description:
A simple permeation enhancer.

Text:
Examples of simple permeation enhancers include ethanol, oleic acid, or dimethyl 
45 
sulfoxide, but new enhancers and enhancement mechanisms are being actively investigated21,22. 46 
An opposite phenomenon  permeation retardation  remains rather unexplored although its 
47 
biological and pharmacological implications can be just as important23. The ability to suppress 
48 
the permeation rate of specific compounds could, for example, enable previously rejected drugs, 
49 
which were found to be too leaky and thus unsuitable for liposomal formulation24, to be 
50 
revisited.
