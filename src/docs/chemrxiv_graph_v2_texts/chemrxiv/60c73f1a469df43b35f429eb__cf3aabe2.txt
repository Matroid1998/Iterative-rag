Description:
A triplet oxygen atom that reacts with unsaturated hydrocarbons to form Cvetanovic diradicals.

Text:
Among various reaction products, triplet oxygen atom reacting with unsaturated hydrocarbons
(RH) can produce Cvetanovic diradicals,1,2 species in which O(3P) is added to a double or a
triple bond. Because oxygen is triplet, the diradical is formed in the triplet state. It can then
undergo series of reactions on the triplet potential energy surface (PES) as well as intersystem
crossing (ISC) to the singlet manifold. The reactions of Cvetanovic diradicals are important in
hydrocarbon combustion, and, to an extent, in atmospheric and interstellar chemistry.15 For
example, the reaction of ethylene with O(3P) can lead to eective secondary chainbranching
and thus enhanced fuel oxidation rate.
