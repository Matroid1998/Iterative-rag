Description:
Acts as an acidic ligand stabilizing low-spin Fe0I centers.

Text:
For example, in hydrogenases, reduction of the cofactor places electrons into a MM bond 
(M  Fe, M  Fe or Ni) that enables it to oxidatively insert the H2 substrate.9 In the FeMoco 
of molybdenumdependent nitrogenase, the close metalmetal distances have fuelled 

speculation that MM bonds could store electrons during the catalytic reduction of 
nitrogen.10,11 However, for iron systems (nitrogenases and others), there are typically bridging 
ligands, the effects of which are difficult to deconvolute from the MM interaction itself. Complexes featuring an unsupported FeFe bond can give more direct insight into metalmetal 
bonding, but they are rare and typically feature lowspin Fe0I centers stabilized by acidic 
carbonyl ligands, for example the Fe2(CO)82 dianion (Figure 1; A).1216
