Description:
High performance organic semiconductor materials.

Text:
Organic semiconductors (OSCs)1,2 are employed in various 
electronic applications including organic lightemitting diodes,3 
organic photovoltaic cells,4 and organic fieldeffect transistors 
(OFETs).510 The results of a large number of papers show that 
the performance of OSCs is controlled by solidstate packing 
governed by intermolecular interactions, exemplified by pp 
interaction,11 CHp interaction,12 SS contact,13 and SN 
contact14 to construct brickwork,15 herringbone,1,1620 and 
slippedpstacked crystal structures.21 Actually, some linearly
fused pelectronic systems exhibit high chargecarrier mobilities 
as a result of their closepacked crystalline structures.2225 For 
example, 
dialkylated 
dinaphtho2,1b2,1fthieno3,2
bthiophenes 
(SDNTTs, 
Figure

and 
2,7
diphenyl1benzothieno3,2b1benzothiophene (DPhBTBT)27 
are known to be high performance OSC materials.
