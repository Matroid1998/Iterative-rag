Description:
Demonstrated for extraction of structural information using XPS.

Text:
Although this extraction of structural information from XPS has so far been 
demonstrated only for TiO2 and FeOx, these examples show that quantitative information can 
be obtained from the VB region, by fitting the spectrum with empirically derived models. Far 
greater potential, however, lies in the possibility of fitting with a simulated spectrum, derived
