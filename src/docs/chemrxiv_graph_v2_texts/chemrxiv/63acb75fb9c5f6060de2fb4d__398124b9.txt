Description:
A defective analogue of C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 with a significantly lower bulk modulus.

Text:
Some studies24, 25 have reported trends 
such as a relationship between size and chemistry of the divalent Bsite metal and the bulk 
modulus, which agree with chemical intuition. Furthermore, the impact of Bsite metal defects 
has been studied by comparing C(NH2)3Mn(HCOO)3 with its defective analogue 
C(NH2)3Fe2313(HCOO)3, (  vacancy), which exhibits a bulk modulus that is nearly 30 
lower.26 This body of work demonstrates the immense potential for tailoring the mechanical 
properties in hybrid and molecular perovskites, depending on a solid understanding of the 
chemical and physical principles that affect them.
