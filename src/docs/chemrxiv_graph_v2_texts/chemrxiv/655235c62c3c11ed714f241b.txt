Description:
Materials studied for chemical changes using IR laser spectroscopy across various timescales.

Text:
The goal of the work in this paper is the development of 
methods of IR laser spectroscopy that can initiate and probe 
chemical change in zeolites across timescales of nanoseconds to 
seconds. Pulsedlaser infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy 
allows vibrational spectra to be recorded with a time resolution 
as small as femtoseconds,4,5 allowing the study of dynamical 
processes such as bond breaking, structural rearrangements 
and molecular diffusion.69 Dynamical processes are initiated by 
pulsedlaser excitation and monitored with synchronised, time
resolved spectroscopic probing of the resulting molecular 
changes.

Description:
Materials whose framework can be heated by relaxation of excited OH and OD vibrations.

Text:
The use of CW lasers to simply heat zeolites has been 
explored, 2022 but the ability to synchronously collect time
resolved spectra on the evolution of the sample was not 
implemented.2022 
Similarly, 
picosecond 
pulsedIR 
investigations of zeolites have demonstrated how the 
relaxation of excited OH and OD vibrations induces heating of 
the 
zeolite 
framework, 
and 
quantified 
the 
resulting 
temperature transients, but only considered the heating as an 
unwanted background to the relaxation behaviour on 
picosecond timeframes.23,24 The ability to heat solid materials 
and monitor their evolution from nanoseconds to seconds with 
timeresolved IR remains unexplored. In this paper we describe 
experiments to do exactly this with an approach of pulsedlaser 
Tjumping and timeresolved IR probing for investigating laser 
a.
