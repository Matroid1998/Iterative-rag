Description:
Nanoparticles that can be incorporated into nanocellulose networks to expand applications.

Text:
Cellulose is one of the most abundant biopolymers and can be produced from many 
sources, including plants and bacteria (1). Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are made from cellulose 
by selectively degrading the cellulosedisordered and amorphous regions using strong acids and 
oxidizers (1). CNC exhibits high crystallinity and hydrophilicity, robust mechanical strength, 
excellent biodegradability, low cytotoxicity to a range of animal and human cell types (2) and 
favorable interactions with cell lines (3). These characteristics made CNC an ideal candidate for 
applications in biological systems (2), such as hosts for drug delivery (4, 5) and cellsupporting 
scaffolds for culturing or tissue engineering (6  10). In addition, incorporating magnetite 
nanoparticles (MNP) into the nanocellulose networks helps expand the applications and better 
realize some existing functionalities (11).
