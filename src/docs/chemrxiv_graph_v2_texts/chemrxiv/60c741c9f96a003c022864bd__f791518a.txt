Description:
Has low activity for OER.

Although a number of single
atom catalysts have been developed for electrochemical reactions,11,12 only few singleatom OER 
catalysts are reported.1316 
OER in alkaline medium is an archetypical electrochemical reaction for which bimetallic catalysts 
are often more active than monometallic catalysts.4,5,1720 Based on timeresolved spectroscopic 
measurements of intermediates in a photochemical OER catalyzed by Co3O4, Frei and coworkers 
proposed that an oxygenbridged CoCo moiety reacted much faster than a single Co site.17 
Moreover, benchmark works showed that the nickeliron oxide (NiFeOx) and cobaltiron oxide 
(CoFeOx) are among the most active OER catalysts in alkaline solutions.4,5,18,19 Incorporation of a 
trace amount of iron will significantly enhance the activity of pure NiOx and CoOx, while pure FeOx 
has low activity.21,22 It follows that instead of singleatom catalysts, a socalled doubleatom 
catalyst would be more active for OER.
