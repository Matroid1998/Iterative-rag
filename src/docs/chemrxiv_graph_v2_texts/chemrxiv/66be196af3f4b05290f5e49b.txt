Description:
A compound that can react at both termini in cycloaddition reactions.

Text:
Upon excitation, siteselectivity of a specific alkene is a consideration, while competing reactivity can lead 
to reaction divergence, such as, uncontrolled alkene scrambling, via geometric isomerization,11 and 42 
cycloaddition via reactivity at both termini of the diene.12 The result is a complex distribution of products that 
is challenging to modulate both photochemically or via EnT.13 To regulate selectivity, the design of non
covalent interactions is ambitious as reaction pathways are intimately linked to intrinsic reactivity and excited
