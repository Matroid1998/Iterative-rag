Description:
Forms an amorphous layer on 4HSiC substrates during pretreatment with BCl3.

Text:
In contrast, the film growing on the (0001) 4HSiC, 
also known as the Siface 4HSiC, was polycrystalline.21 From the literature, we note that 
epitaxial growth of rB4C on the Siface of 4HSiC substrates by CVD has been reported.22 But 
this CVD process used BCl3 and C3H8 as precursors and 4 offaxis 4HSiC substrates and 
required pretreatment of the surface with BCl3 to form an amorphous boron layer, which was 
converted to rB4C upon CVD with BCl3 and C3H8 at 1600 C. Without the pretreatment, the 
BxC growth on the Siface of 4HSiC was also polycrystalline.22 Epitaxial B4C growth on 4H
SiC (0001) has also been reported using pulsed lazer deposition.23
