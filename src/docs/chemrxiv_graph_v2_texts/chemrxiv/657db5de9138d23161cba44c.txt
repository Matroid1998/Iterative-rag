Description:
A metal used in catalytic converters to catalyze the conversion of dangerous pollutants.

Text:
Green chemistry is greatly advanced by catalytic converters, which also have important 
technological ramifications for the fight against pollution in the environment. These 
devices, which are often made of metals like palladium and platinum, are essential in 
catalyzing the conversion of dangerous pollutants released by internal combustion 
engines into less dangerous ones. Catalytic converters support the ideas of green
