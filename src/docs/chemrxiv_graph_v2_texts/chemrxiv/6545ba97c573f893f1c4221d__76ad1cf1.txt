Description:
A topological insulator with non-warped, inverted bands and single-valley electronic structure.

Text:
The bands in the
TI material Bi2Se3, for example, are not warped as evidenced by
the singlevalleyed electronic structure (NV  1, Figure 1b). In
contrast, the bands are sufficiently inverted in Bi2Te3, giving rise
to a comparatively higher valley degeneracy of NV  6 (Figure

Fig. 1 Band inversion and bulk band structure. (a) Illustration of
band inversiondriven warping in topological insulators. Stronger band
inversion generally leads to warped bands after a critical inversion
strength and, as a result, high valley degeneracy. The concept is
exemplified by (b) Bi2Se3 and (c) Bi2Te3.

Description:
A topological insulator with insufficiently inverted bands resulting in a single valley.

Text:
Both compounds are
topological insulators and have inverted bands; yet, the bands are not
sufficiently inverted in Bi2Se3 resulting in a single valley (NV  1),
whereas the bands are sufficiently inverted in Bi2Te3 resulting in warped
bands and high valley degeneracy (NV  6). 110  1
