Description:
Moieties that have not been reported in the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs).

Text:
Multistep organic synthetic methods have been 
successfully translated to the solid state.14 This practice 
has become especially attractive for the synthesis of new 
covalent organic frameworks (COFs).58 Their hallmark 
features, porosity and crystallinity, allow chemical 
transformations to be done on the framework and enable 
rigorous analysis of concurrent structural changes through 
diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.5,6 
The synthesis of COFs relies on an initial reversible step 
to guide the covalent assembly of organic building units 
into extended and crystalline structures.912 This step can 
be followed by one or more postsynthetic transformations, 
leading to structural complexity and function of the 
framework.5,8,10,11 This has been demonstrated for a number 
of iminelinked COFs,1315 but hydrazide moieties have not 
been reported yet.

Description:
Has a rather hydrophilic nature.

Text:
Here, we report three 2D and 3D hydrazidelinked COFs 
following postsynthetic oxidation of the hydrazinelinking 
units (Scheme 1). Considering the rather hydrophilic 
nature of the hydrazine and hydrazide linkages, we chose 
to study the effect of the synthetic transformations with 
water vapor sorption analysis.16,17 This not only allowed us 
to explore new sorbents for water harvesting from air, but 
also provided us with additional insight into the micro 
and macroscopic changes occurring on the framework. Scheme 1. Synthetic strategy for hydrazidelinked COFs. This strategy was applied to a molecular model system and 
two 2D (hcb, sql) and one 3D (dia) COFs.
