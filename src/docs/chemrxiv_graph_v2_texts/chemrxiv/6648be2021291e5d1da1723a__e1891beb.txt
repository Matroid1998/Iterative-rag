Description:
Used as a catholyte in Mg-based flow batteries.

Text:
Despite the significant progress made to advance the performance of Mg
ion solidstate batteries, the development of Mgbased flow batteries is still in the early stage. Only 
a few recent studies have been demonstrated by Qin et al.10 and He et al.11 using polymer and 
polysulfide as catholytes, respectively. Unlike solidstate rechargeable batteries, Mg flow batteries
