Description:
Known for its reactivity as an electrophile with multiple allotropes.

Text:
Elemental sulfur and polysulfides play a major role in organic synthesis, 1, 2 biochemistry, 3, 4 materials science5 and 
other fields of chemistry. Due to its rather unique catenation behavior, elemental sulfur has multiple allotropes with 
the most stable being cyclooctasulfur (S8). 6 Sulfur is mostly known for its reactivity as an electrophile, but the 
types of products obtained vary based on the nature of the nucleophile. Strong nucleophiles like phosphines, 79 
sulfite, 10, 11 or cyanide12, 13 provide monosulfide products exclusively.

Description:
Incorporates into products through reactions with carbon-based nucleophiles.

Text:
Similarly, carbonbased nucleophiles usually 
provide products with the incorporation of a single sulfur atom, for example in the Gewald1416 or Willgerodt
Kindler17 reactions.18 Nitrogenbased nucleophiles are often proposed to open S8 as part of complex mechanisms, 
1, 2 oxygen bases generate sulfur radical anions19, 20 or thiosulfate, 21 while hydrogen sulfide and thiols react with 
sulfur to form complex mixtures of polysulfides. 2226 In most cases, opening of S8 by the nucleophile is believed to 
be ratedetermining, therefore the productdetermining steps are kinetically invisible and thus still poorly 
characterized. Indeed, experimental investigations of polysulfide mechanisms are complicated by their 
thermodynamic instability2730 and recent evidence shows that they interconvert faster than they are trapped by 
chemical probes.

Description:
Involved in reactions with cyanide and phosphines to form monosulfide products.

3133 As such, computational investigations seem uniquelypositioned to provide key mechanistic 
information to understand the seemingly unpredictable reactivity of sulfur and polysulfides under various 
conditions. The precise determination of the mechanism of these reactions would allow for greater predictability in 
the design of reactions involving sulfur and polysulfides and facilitate the study of biochemical polysulfides. 3436 
To tackle this problem, we decided to focus on the simple but representative reactions of sulfur with cyanide 
and phosphines, which generate the monosulfide products R3PS (phosphine sulfides) or SCN (thiocyanate) 
quantitatively. The reaction of sulfur with phosphines was first reported in 18377 and the formation of the phosphine 
sulfide was shown to be almost instantaneous.

Description:
Elemental sulfur participates in reactions involving nucleophilic attacks.

Text:
8 From 1955, Bartlett and coworkers reported kinetic studies on the 
reaction of elemental sulfur with triarylphosphines9 and cyanide, 12, 13 where they provided strong evidence that the 
ratedetermining step for the formation of the observed products is the bimolecular opening of the S8 ring by the 
nucleophile. They proposed the mechanism shown in (Scheme 1 path A) which was first formulated by Foss. 11 
In this proposal, the thiocyanate or phosphine sulfide is displaced by nucleophilic attacks on the adjacent sulfur of 
the progressively shrinking polysulfides, starting with the octasulfide 1.

Description:
Elemental form can be detected in complex biochemical settings.

Text:
Another proposal for the decomposition of 
the polysulfides came from Schmidt who argued, based on claims of resonance between sulfur atoms in polysulfide 
chains, that the negativelycharged terminal sulfur was in fact the most electrophilic position and could be 
abstracted by the nucleophile (Scheme 1 path B). 37 Due to limited experimental support for either mechanism, 
over the following decades both the FossBartlett3841 and Schmidt42 mechanisms were presented as correct in books 
and reviews of the topic. Since these reactions have fast rates and clean product profiles, they have found 
applications for the titration 12 or detection of elemental sulfur43, 44 in complex biochemical settings.
