Description:
Used in the thermal decomposition to prepare Na1xGe3z.

Text:
A typical example is the 
binary Na1xGe3z, prepared by thermal decomposition of Na4Ge4 and, it comprises a covalently 
bonded, zeolitelike Ge framework, in which Na atoms and also additional Ge atoms reside in 
small and broad channels formed by the framework, respectively. 11 But here again, some Ge 
atoms are disordered at the middle of the broad channel, and the nature of their interactions with 
their coordination sphere is unclear. Furthermore, the formation of new modifications of silicon 
(alloSi) and germanium (alloGe) from oxidative removal of alkali metal from Li3NaSi6 and 
Li7Ge12 respectively, 12 as well as the formation of nanostructured materials 78 and novel 
allotrope of germanium using the Zintl phases Na4Ge9 or Mg2Ge as precursors have been 
reported.
