Description:
A compound involved in reduction reactions in photocatalytic processes.

Text:
Zigzag derivatives contain more nodes and less sextets than 
their armchair analogs, which results in the destabilization of their HOMO levels and a 
narrowing of their energy gaps.5 Chemical functionalization with electrondonating groups have 
also been used to systematically engineer the energy gap of GQDs for application in 
photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction.6 These photocatalytic reactions have also been 
demonstrated for GQDs used in 0D2D van der Waals heterojunctions with graphene.7 GQDs 
can also selfassemble into stacked structures that efficiently harvest light along the stack810.
