Description:
Catalyze reactions involving oxidation states from 2 to 4, with the cation species M3 as the main active center.

Besides, as in the case of other transition
metal oxides 13, their catalytic activity can be enhanced
by doping or by introducing oxygen vacancies. In recent studies of OER reaction mechanisms on
cobalt oxides, surface Co ions have been proposed as the
active site for OER 1416. According to these propos
als, the oxidation state of cobalt increases during OER. As a result, the density and oxidation state of surface
cobalt ions are critical for OERORR activity. When
these reactions are catalyzed by manganese or cobalt
oxides or (oxy)hydroxides, it involves oxidation states
from 2 to 4, with the cation species M3 being the
main active center 1517.
