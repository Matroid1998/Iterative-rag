Associated with the shuttle effect and dissolution issues in batteries.

Various strategies have been deployed to enhance performance, such as 
refining the nanostructures,6 embedding the silicon particles within a carbon matrix,7 
developing specifically tailored binders,8 and enhancing the electrolytes.9 In contrast, a 
sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) was exploited by Wang at 2002,10 which employs a 
solidsolid conversion mechanism that effectively addresses the dissolution of polysulfides, 
commonly associated with the shuttle effect. Although this material has a voltage loss 
(average discharge voltage at 1.8 V) compared to the traditional sulfur cathode (average 
discharge voltage at 2.2 V), it still potentially afford a high energy density. The 
compatibility of carbonate electrolyte makes SPAN a good applicant to match graphite or 
silicon anodes.
