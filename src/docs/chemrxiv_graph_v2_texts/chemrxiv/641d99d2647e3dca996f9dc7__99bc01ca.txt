Description:
Has a high solubility for Zn2, reaching 22 mol at 1100 K.

Examples of materials interesting from the 
point of view of their semiconducting properties are ZnO solid solutions with magnesium oxide 
2,3 and nickel oxide 4,5. The research is developing in two directions epitaxial stabilization of 
rsZnO in thin films on oriented substrates 25 and highpressure phase transition of wurtzite ZnO 
into cubic one 616. At ambient pressure the solubility of Ni2 in wZnO is extremely low, being 0.9 mol at 1100 K. 
The solubility of Zn2 in rsNiO is much higher, namely, 29 mol at 1100 K 17 or 35 mol at 
1500 K 18. At 1100 K, the solubility of Co2 in wZnO is 6.5 mol while Zn2 solubility in 
rsCoO is three times higher, reaching 22 mol 17.
