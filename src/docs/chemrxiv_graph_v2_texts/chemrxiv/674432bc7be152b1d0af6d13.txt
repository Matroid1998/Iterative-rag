Description:
Monomers used in polymerization to create highly crosslinked polymer networks.

Text:
The mesogenic groups may be located in the polymer backbone 
(mainchain LCE)31 or as a pendant group (sidechain LCE).32 After the alignment, a 
crosslinking step is employed, leading to a loosely crosslinked, elastomeric network with 
a welldefined structure. Thus, functional LCE materials are typically soft, elastic 
materials.24,33,34 
Liquid crystalline networks (LCN), or liquid crystalline thermosets, are highly crosslinked 
polymer networks containing mesogenic groups. Their crosslinking densities, and thus 
their properties, are similar to conventional thermosets, which may be obtained by 
polymerizing e.g., (meth)acrylate monomers with a high fraction of crosslinker. By aligning 
the mesogens in LCNs before polymerization, directional anisotropy in mechanical 
properties, in particular high strength in the direction of the alignment, can be achieved.
