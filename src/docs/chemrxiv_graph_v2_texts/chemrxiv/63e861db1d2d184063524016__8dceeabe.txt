Description:
A greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 22,450 times higher than CO2.

The rise in global warming and climaterelated issues has long been connected to the 
anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Six GHGs were specified in the Kyoto 
protocol in 1997, namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrofluorocarbons, methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) 1. CO2 is perhaps the most well
known GHG from a general public pointofview and carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
technologies have garnered significant attention in the last couple of decades as a way for CO2 
sequestration. The most abundant of the six known GHGs  CO2, accounts for 76 of the total greenhouse 
gas emissions 2. On the other hand, SF6 has been found to have a global warming potential 
(GWP) of 22,450 times higher than CO2 3.
