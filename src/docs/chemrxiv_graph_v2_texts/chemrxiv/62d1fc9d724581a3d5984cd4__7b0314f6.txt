Description:
Utilized as catalysts in the direct borylation of C(sp2)H bonds.

Text:
Organoboron compounds are now considered as one of the 
most essential building blocks for synthesis.14 Among 
these, organic molecules with C(sp2)B bonds represent a 
large and important class of substrates that can be trans
formed into various derivatives through a multitude of 
straightforward approaches relying on the replacement of 
the tricoordinate boronbased moiety.57 As a general ap
proach toward diverse boronbased functional groups 
from their simple prefunctionalized precursors, direct 
borylation of C(sp2)H bonds utilizing transition metal 
catalysts811 or electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr)12 
have been previously studied with emphases on both reac
tivity and selectivity (Figure 1a).
