Description:
A cation used as a substitutional element for Ni in NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 to mitigate degradation.

Text:
In particular, NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2, referred to as the O3 phase 
according to the Delmas notation, is attractive since it has a specific capacity of more 
than 200 mAh g1 at a cut off voltage above 4.2 V.2, 7 However, when charged to high 
voltages (deep desodiation), complex phase transitions occur that include a sudden 
reduction in the c lattice parameter of more than 20. This behavior has been 
correlated with accelerated degradation of the material.7a, 8 
To mitigate the degradation of O3NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 at high voltages, many cations have 
been used as substitutional elements for Ni, including Li, Mg2, Al3, Zn2, Zr4, Sn4, 
etc. (with typical amounts of 210 with respect to the total amount of transition
