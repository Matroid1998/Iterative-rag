Description:
An acidic posttranslational modification preferred by SIRT5.

Text:
As such, SIRT5 has a 
preference for acidic posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as eNmalonyllysine (Kmal), eN
succinyllysine (Ksuc), and eNglutaryllysine (Kglut).2325 
Sirtuin 5 is one of three sirtuins (SIRT35) that primarily localize to the mitochondria and several mitochondrial 
proteins are subjected to SIRT5mediated deacylation.2628 For example, SIRT5 rescues the activity of 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) by desuccinylation of modified lysine residues to (1) eliminate reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) generated during oxidative phosphorylation,29 (2) protect mitochondrial autophagy under 
starvation,30 and (3) reduce macrophageinduced inflammation in vivo.31 Furthermore, SIRT5 has been 
identified in both the cytosol and nucleus, where it is proposed to desuccinylate modified proteins as well.26 
With an increasing number of reports implicating SIRT5 in pathogenesis, including as a liability in various 
cancers,3241 there is a growing need for effective inhibitors that can be applied in living cells.
