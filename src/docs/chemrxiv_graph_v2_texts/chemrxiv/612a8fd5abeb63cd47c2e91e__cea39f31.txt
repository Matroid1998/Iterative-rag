Description:
Potentially induces oxidatively generated damage to cellular DNA and the proteome.

Text:
Recent investigations have shown that approximately half of the observed oxidatively 
generated DNA damage in cells treated with Aza or 6thioguanine (6tGua) originates from the 
direct photoactivation of the metabolized 6tGuo nucleotide in the intracellular pool.9 This raises 
an important question as to whether Aza and 6MP themselves can induce oxidatively generated 
damage to cellular DNA in the intracellular pool and to the proteome. To narrow this knowledge 
gap, a thorough investigation of the photochemical properties of both drugs in aqueous solutions 
under physiologicalrelevant conditions must be performed. Such a study can reveal the 
phototoxic likelihood of these drugs to cells and if it is necessary to investigate their direct 
participation in UVAinduced cellular damage.
