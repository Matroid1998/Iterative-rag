Description:
Used as a titanium inorganic precursor for depositing titanicone films.

Text:
Titanicones are deposited by 
coupling a titanium inorganic precursors such as titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with organic alcohols 
such as ethylene glycol (EG) 262728293031, glycerol (GL) 293031 or fumaric acid 
(FC).32 Tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (Ti(N(CH3)2)4, henceforth denoted Ti(DMA)4 ) was also 
successfully employed as Ti source and combined with EG and GL to deposit titanicone films.33 
In ref 30 titanicone films were deposited using TiCl4 as metal source and EG or GL as organic 
precursors. TiCl4EG films and TiCl4GL films were deposited on Si(100) wafers. XRR analysis found
