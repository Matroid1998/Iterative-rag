Description:
A molecule with electron density revealing local maxima at atomic nuclei and decreasing away from them.

Text:
Contour plot of the electron density (at
z  0, in plane with the phenyl ring) surrounding
the salicylic acid molecule. The electron density re
veals local maxima at the atomic nuclei and decreases
as one moves away from the nuclei. The point with
the lowest electron density along a bond path (ei
ther covalent or noncovalent) is termed a bondcritical
point. Figure inspired by reference 17 and created us

addition
to
geometric
deep
learning
approaches,5,1922 also simulationbased approaches
(e.g., free energy perturbation,23,24 MMPBSA2527)
are frequently used for binding affinity prediction. While simulationbased methods are, by design, rooted
in physical principles, deeplearning methods often
incur lower computational cost for predictions and
can leverage preexisting data.
