Description:
A key fatty acid for zooplankton and fish.

Text:
It has long been shown that total fatty acid 
profiles differ between groups of algae. In 
freshwater biofilms, which are often 
dominated by diatoms and chlorophytes, 
the specific distribution influences the 
overall composition of the food available 
for consumers, making it a crucial driver of 
the health and stability of aquatic food 
chains. According to Arts et al. 4, both 3 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 205n3) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 226), and the 
6 arachidonic acid (ARA, 204n6) are 
key fatty acids for zooplankton and fish. Freshwater diatoms are also rich in 
palmitoleic acid (161n7), palmitic acid 
(160), and myristic acid (140).
