Description:
Part of a series that displayed an inhibition effect on T. cruzi.

of functional diversity on the molecular scaffold was considered. The compounds 
4c to 4h, substituted on the C4 position with various electrondonating and withdrawing 
groups on the benzylic ring Bn2 displayed a decrease in antitrypanosomal activity with an IC50 
value over 5 M. Besides, in order to decrease the lipophilicity of the main scaffold, the 
introduction of Nheteroaromatics was also realized (6ad and 9ad). A decrease of cytotoxicity 
as well as lipophilicity could definitely be observed, yet no trypanocide effect was visible. The 
trifluoromethylated pyridyl and pyrimidyl derivatives were used because of their easier 
accessibility than their tertbutyl analogues and the similar properties between CF3 and tBu, 
both being bioisosteres.30,54,55 Only 9a from the 3Nheteroaromatic menadione series 9 
displayed an inhibition effect on T. cruzi (IC50  4.16 M).
