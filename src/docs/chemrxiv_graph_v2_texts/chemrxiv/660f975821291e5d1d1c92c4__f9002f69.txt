Description:
A surfactant that undergoes EZ photoisomerization to enhance disinfectant performance and manipulate wetting.

Text:
To produce light 
responsive surfactants, photoswitches such as azobenzenes11, diarylethenes12 or spiropyranes13, 
are integrated to hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail of the surfactant. Azobenzene based 
Arylazopyrazole(AAP) surfactants which can be subjected to EZ photoisomerization depending 
on wavelength of light, are designed to increase disinfectant performance14, manipulate wetting15 
or assemble supramolecules16. Simulations become more and more powerful to perform systematic investigations at different 
length and time scales and can extract information about underlying mechanisms. Coarse grained 
simulation can be performed for longer times scales to capture adsorptiondesorption dynamics17 
or micelle formation18 of surfactants but due to the reduced degrees of freedom, some atomistic 
details disappear during the coarse graining process. Moreover, quantumbased calculations can 
be conducted to capture the system dynamics on a highly accurate level.
