Description:
Nanomaterials with unique electrical, optical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties used in various industrial applications.

Text:
The emergence of nanotechnology has revolutionized different industrial sectors1. This revolution is driven by the capability to synthesize and use nanosized materials, 
with size that are less than 100 nm in dimension2. Among different nanomaterials, 
carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) have attracted considerable attention because of their 
unique electrical, optical, thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties, which offer a 
wide range of applications in several industrial sectors, such as optoelectronics, 
sensors, and medicine. For instance, CNMenabled technologies are being developed 
to enhance energy storage systems, which play a critical role in renewable energy 
integration and reducing greenhouse gas emissions35, both of which are paramount 
to achieving carbon neutrality in the long run.
