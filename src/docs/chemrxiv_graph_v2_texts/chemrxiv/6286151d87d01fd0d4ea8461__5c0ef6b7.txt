Description:
Can be safely used as photoaffinity labels.

In this work, we addressed this gap in chemistry we elaborated 
a general practical method for trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl 
aliphatic diazirines, characterized them and studied them in model 
photolabeling and biological experiments (Figure 2). Moreover, we 
have shown that the undeservedly neglected before aliphatic 
trifluoromethyl diazirines could be safely used as photoaffinity 
labels, while the difluoromethylating analogues  cannot, due to 
chemical instability. Results and Discussion. Azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine 
are among the most popular secondary amines in drug 
discovery.30,31 Scientists use these amines in almost every 
medicinal chemistry project.
