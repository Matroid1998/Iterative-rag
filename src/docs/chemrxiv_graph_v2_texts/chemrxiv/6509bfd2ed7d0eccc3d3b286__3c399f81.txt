Description:
Extremely chemically stable and excellent proton conductors in acidic conditions.

Text:
Research intensified on the
transport properties of these membranes along with the development of hydrogenoxygen
fuel cells; consequently, perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomers such as Nafion, which are ex
tremely chemically stable and excellent proton conductors in acidic conditions, have become
the most widely known and deeply studied cation exchange membranes.2
The broadening applications of electrochemical cells call for a thorough understanding of
ion exchange membrane properties in diverse chemical environments, in order to synchronize
the development of nextgeneration materials with the design of new technology. Redox
flow batteries (RFBs) constitute a case where this approach could be particularly signifi
cant.
