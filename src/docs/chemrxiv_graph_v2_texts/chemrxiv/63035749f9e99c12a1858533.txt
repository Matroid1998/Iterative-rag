Description:
Part of donor-acceptor systems in tricarbonyl Re(I) complexes.

Text:
100 nm in the absorption maximum and a 200
fold increase in the lifetime, accompanied by a 5fold
increase in the extinction coefficient.23
In contrast, the analogous 3N dicarbonyl terpyridine
complexes (2ab) have an excited state of MLCT charac
ter irrespective of the substituent in a remote position, as
shown by transient IR (TRIR), and are nonemissive.24
Hanan and coworkers have shown that replacement of
the axial halide ligand in similar complexes leads to a
recovery of NIR emission.32
Gordon and coworkers have recently reported on a
series of tricarbonyl Re(I) complexes with thiophene
based donoracceptor systems with varying degrees of
ILCT and localised ,  characters.33 They have also
reported on a series of Pt(II) bis(acetylide) and Re(I)
tricarbonyl complexes with triphenylaminesubstituted
phenanthroline ligands, in which the MLCT and ILCT
characters were switched as a function of the substituents
on the triphenylamine group.34.
