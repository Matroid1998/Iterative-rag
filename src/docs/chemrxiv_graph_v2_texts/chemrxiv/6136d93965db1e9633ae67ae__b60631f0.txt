Introduction 
Filamentous fungi from the genus Aspergillus are prolific 
producers of secondary metabolites which display a diverse 
range of bioactivities.1 As part of our ongoing chemotaxonomic 
exploration of rare and talented Australian Aspergilli,310 we 
recently reported the novel species Aspergillus burnettii, 
isolated from soil collected in Queensland, Australia.4 Chemical 
profiling of A. burnettii revealed a variety of unprecedented 
secondary metabolites, including the polyketidepeptide hybrid 
burnettramic acids,6 which displayed potent antifungal activity. Continuing the chemical exploration of A. burnettii, herein we 
report the structure, biological activity and biosynthesis of the 
novel polyenedecalin polyketide, burnettiene A (1).
