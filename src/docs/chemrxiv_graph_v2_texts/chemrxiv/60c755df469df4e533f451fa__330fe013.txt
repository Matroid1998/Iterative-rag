Description:
Inserts into silicon during electrochemical lithiation, forming a lithiated silicon phase.

Text:
In the first 
stages of electrochemical lithiation of crystalline Si, it is directly transformed to a highly 
lithiated amorphous silicon, aLixSi, typically at around 0.1 V vs Li.36,37 The exact value 
of x is difficult to determine due to electrolyte decomposition taking place in conjunction 
with Li insertion into the Si, but the capacity associated with this transformation is 3000 
mAhg,38 and the value of x has been reported as 3.43.5.37,39 The terminal stage of 
lithiation that can be attained at room temperature is a metastable crystalline phase, where
