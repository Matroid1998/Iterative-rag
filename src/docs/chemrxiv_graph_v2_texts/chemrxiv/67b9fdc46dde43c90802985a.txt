Nanoparticles used in magnetic hyperthermia therapy and magnetic resonance imaging.

Text:
Manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MnxFe3xO4 MNPs) have attracted considerable attention for their 
potential applications in magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI)1. The substitution of Fe2 by Mn2 in the spinel structure can significantly alter their magnetic 
anisotropy, saturation magnetization (Ms), heating, and contrast efficiency due to the changes in their 
structural properties, including crystal structure, crystallite size, and lattice parameter2,3,4. While the 
impact of the Mn2 content on the magnetic properties has been investigated in recent years using 
many different MnxFe3xO4 MNPs,5,6,7,8 a direct correlation between the Mn2 content and the magnetic 
properties is not yet clear.
