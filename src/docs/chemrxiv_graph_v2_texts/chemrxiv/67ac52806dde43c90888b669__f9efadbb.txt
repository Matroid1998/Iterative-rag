Description:
Longer chain variants have been shown to be relevant in HDAC inhibitor and PROTAC development.

Text:
Through simultaneous binding to the E3 ligase and the 
POI proximity is induced and the E3 ligase is recruited to polyubiquitinylate the target which leads to 
its proteasomal degradation.8 In recent years, hydrazides have emerged as possible zincbinding groups 
for HDAC inhibitors and degraders.9 Especially Nsubstituted hydrazides have gained attention in 
HDAC inhibitor and PROTAC development. Longer chain alkyl hydrazides have been shown to
