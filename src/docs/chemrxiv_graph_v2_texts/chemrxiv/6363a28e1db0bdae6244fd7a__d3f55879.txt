Description:
Undergoes Mg intercalation to form Mg3V2S8 with SS bond cleavage.

While conventional topochemistry is coupled with cation redox, it was 
proposed5 that anionic sp bands are also subject to redox reactions during 
(de)intercalation processes in highly covalent chalcogenides like CuxCr2Se4,6 TiS3,7 
LixFeS28 and VS4.9 That concept is gaining ground in battery research aiming to 
maximise cumulative electrochemical capacity from both cation and anion redox.10 
Anion redox enables extension of chemical space by topochemistry and is expected 
to often involve formation or cleavage of anionanion covalent bonds, for example in 
the recent reports of Fe3(S2)(S22)0.51112 and Mg3V2S8,13 which were respectively 
derived by Li deintercalation from Li2FeS2 to form SS bonds and Mg intercalation into 
V4(S22)2 to break them. These structural transformations are drastic despite their 
reversibility and low reaction temperatures.
