Description:
Unmasked from Cy7 photocage with a 100-fold enhancement of uncaging efficiency.

Text:
Thereby, we achieved for 
the first time a clean direct uncaging of unmasked carboxylate 
from Cy7 photocage with a remarkable 100fold enhancement 
of the uncaging efficiency. We show that the enahncement is 
a consequence of kinetic trapping of the primary carbenium 
ion. We further demonstrate that extending the stabilization 
strategy reaches the limits of practical use of the 
photoheterolysis in Cy7 photocages due to inherent 
thermodynamic boundaries. We discuss how this boundaries 
affect the available options to improve the uncaging efficiency 
of NIR photocages by molecular design and propose how to 
overcome these themodynamic obstacles.
