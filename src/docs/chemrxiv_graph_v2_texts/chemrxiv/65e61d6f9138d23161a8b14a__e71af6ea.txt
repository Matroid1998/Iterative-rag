Description:
An anionic chromophore of photoactive yellow protein that undergoes low-frequency motions with the surrounding solvent leading to spectral broadening.

Text:
For ex
ample, by careful analysis of the trajectory, for the an
ionic chromophore of photoactive yellow protein, depro
tonated transthiophenylpcoumarate (pCT), some of
the authors showed that lowfrequency motions of the
chromophore with the surrounding solvent led to spectral
broadening, and coupling of the highfrequency motion
of the CO stretch to solvent led to increased vibronic
