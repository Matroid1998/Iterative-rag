Organogelators include low molecularweight organogelators (LMG) and polymeric organogelators. 29 
LMGs express their functions by creating threedimensional supramolecular structures, such as self
30 
assembled fibrous structures, through noncovalent bonds, such as van der Waals interactions,  
31 
interactions, solvophobic effects, and hydrogen bonding. Various sugar derivatives have been 
32 
developed as LMGs.1 Dglucose has been the most well studied among the sugars, and various 
33 
derivatives have been developed as organogelators.26 However, synthesizing various organogelators 
34 
derived from Dglucose inevitably requires multiple steps. This is because the anomeric position of 
35 
Dglucose can form two stereoisomers,  and forms, and methyl glycosylation is often performed 
36 
first to fix either one of them.
