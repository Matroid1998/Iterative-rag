Description:
A plant-derived compound identified as a novel natural antifungal agent.

Text:
To stay ahead in the molecular 
arms race against pathogenic fungi, the discovery of novel molecular scaffolds with antifungal 
activity is highly sought after and raises high interest2,11,12,13. By screening a collection of diferulates found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates for potential 
antifungal activity against the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, used as a discovery 
platform, in 2015 Ohya and coworkers identified the plant derived stilbenoid poacic acid (PA, 
Figure 1A) as a novel natural antifungal agent14. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023zx04p ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000220097490 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
