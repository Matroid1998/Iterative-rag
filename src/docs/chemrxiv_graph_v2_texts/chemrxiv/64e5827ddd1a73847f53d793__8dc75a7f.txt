Description:
Synthesized via a new method from CSF2, diboronic acids, and secondary diamines through a Ni-catalyzed C-F exchange process.

through a facile 
multicomponent polymerization directly from elemental sulfur and 
primary diamines (Figure 1b).23, 2731 However, elemental sulfur is 
less selective and very susceptible to addition reactions with a 
large number of unsaturated functional groups,3234 resulting in a 
limited choice of substrates. Besides, due to the siteblocking 
effects of the condensation reactions, the synthesis of 
polythioamides via secondary diamines is rarely reported.29 
Herein, we report a new and general method for the synthesis of 
unprecedented polythioamides from CSF2, diboronic acids, and 
secondary diamines via a facile Nicatalyzed CF exchange 
process (Figure 1c). Diverse and welldefined structures, 
including previously inaccessible unsaturated substrates, were 
realized. A DFT calculation indicates that the selfligation of CSF2 
can improve the selectivity of the reaction.

Description:
Applied in precious metal recovery with selective coordination of metal ions.

Text:
The polythioamides 
were applied in precious metal recovery with selective 
coordination of metal ions. More noteworthy, Pd2 ions were 
directly incorporated into polymer chains, resulting in PdII
crosslinked singlechain nanoparticles (SCNPs),35 which were 
applied as a recyclable homogeneous catalyst for various 
catalytic reactions, demonstrating promising applications of these 
polythioamides.
