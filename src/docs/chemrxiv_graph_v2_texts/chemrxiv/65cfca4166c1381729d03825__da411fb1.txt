Description:
An element involved in nuclear fusion reactions.

Text:
The Advanced Research Projects Agency  Energy (ARPA
E) recently funded eight projects to develop novel nu
clear technologies to potentially transform carbonfree en
ergy sources and strengthen the nations advanced energy
endeavors13. New developments in nuclear fusion technolo
gies are based on the energy output of nuclear reactions be
tween light isotopes such as deuterium (symbol D), isotopic
helium (3He), and tritium (T).

Description:
Detection is used as a diagnostic method in Low Energy Nuclear Reactions to determine nuclear processes.

Text:
The individual detection of the isotopes of hydrogen
and helium requires a mass resolution of over 1000 because
the molecular masses of HT, D2, and 4He are quite close with
each other (mz  4.0239, 4.0282, and 4.0026, respectively).4
One such instrument, an omegatron ICR mass spectrometer,
has been in use at the Alcator CMod tokamak magnetic fu
sion device for sampling the plasma.7,8 An ultrahigh resolu
tion quadrapole mass spectrometer, the Hiden DLS20 (Hiden
Analytical Ltd., Warrington, Cheshire, UK) has been specif
ically designed for the analysis of lowmass isotopes during
the deuteriumtritium campaign at the Joint European Torus
(JET).9 A similar quadrapole mass spectrometry method has
been used at the DIIID26, EAST and the HT7 tokamaks.10,11
Especially in the field of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions
(LENR), helium detection is used as a diagnostic method to
determine if a result can be attributed to known nuclear pro
cesses.

Description:
Makes up 5.24 ppm of the Earth's atmosphere.

Text:
Although the use of twoQuadrapole Mass Spectrom
eters (QMS)12 were first used, most other helium measure
ments were performed using a double focusing 90 magnetic
sector instrument.13,14 Other scientific investigations, includ
ing climate research, also require the analysis of low mass
isotopes1518 Since helium makes up 5.24 ppm of the Earths
atmosphere1921, one major challenge to these helium detec
tion measurements is removing external sources of helium and
mitigating contamination of gas samples. As a part of these DOE ARPA collaborative projects, Cate
gory A teams are exploring new novel reactions and Category
B teams provide support to independently confirm or deny dis
coveries.
