Description:
A metal-organic framework (MOF) for which theoretical isotherms can be generated using Monte Carlo simulations.

Text:
Recently, Dantas et al. suggested an approach to com
partmentalise adsorption isotherms as the sum of isotherms
for individual pore compartments. 20 Molecular simulation can
readily predict gas adsorption based on the crystal structure
of MOFs. 21 Neimark and coworkers and also shown how to
generate theoretical isotherms corresponding to the individual
pore compartments of the MOFs PCN224 and ZIF412 us
ing Monte Carlo simulations. 22 The above studies used visual
markers from the crystal structure to identify the pore lim
its, which may be straightforward for some systems, but this
may prove nebulous in porous materials with a complex pore
system. Fig. 1 Atomistic structures of DUT32, DUT75, UMCM1, NU1000, ex
amined in this study.
