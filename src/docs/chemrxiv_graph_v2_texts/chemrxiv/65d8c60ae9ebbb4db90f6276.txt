Description:
An element that can be shared by two or three rings in polybenzenoid hydrocarbons, forming 2D structures.

Text:
Polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) are poly
cyclic aromatic systems (PASs) that contain
only fused benzene rings. PBHs can be con
sidered as cutouts from a graphene sheet and
can be further divided into catacondensed and
pericondensed PBHs (ccPBHs and pcPBHs,
respectively; see Figure 1). The difference lies
in the way the benzene rings are fused to one
another. While in ccPBHs, any carbon atom
can be shared by at most two adjacent rings,
in pcPBHs, a single carbon can be shared by
up to three rings, which leads to the forma
tion of 2D structures.
