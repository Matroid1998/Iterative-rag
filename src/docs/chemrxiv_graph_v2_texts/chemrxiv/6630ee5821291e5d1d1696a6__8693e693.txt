Description:
Aryl groups are used in transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling for assembling building blocks relevant to medicinal and crop science applications.

Despite their prevalence, the CH bonds 
present in these molecules exhibit extraordinary inertness, rendering conventional synthetic 
methodologies for converting gaseous hydrocarbons into functionalized derivatives often 
ineffective or lacking in selectivity (Scheme 1A).7 As a consequence, gaseous hydrocarbons 
are predominantly utilized as energy sources in combustion processes. In modern synthetic chemistry, arylation reactions serve as indispensable tools for assembling 
building blocks relevant to medicinal and crop science applications.812 Consequently, 
transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling has emerged as the gold standard for assembling such 
units, often achieved through the combination of prefunctionalized starting materials, including 
aryl or alkyl halides and organometallic reagents.13 While these prefunctionalized fragments 
offer high chemofidelity, they also come with drawbacks such as low atom economy, high 
toxicity, and often moisture and air instability.
