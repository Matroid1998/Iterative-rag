Description:
A precursor used in the ALD of aluminum nitride.

Text:
Aluminum nitride (AlN) is a widegap semiconductor known for its wide bandgap of around 6.2 
eV2, a thermal conductivity comparable to that of metals of 285 Wm1K1, a high melting point of 
2750 C, and electrical resistance of 1013 cm, making it a highly promising material for 
utilization in micro and optoelectronic applications.3 ALD of AlN typically relies on trimethyl 
aluminum (TMA) and ammonia (NH3) as precursors.4,5 The deposition of AlN from TMA, with 
aluminumcarbon bonds, often suffers from carbon impurities and an efficient carboncleaning 
surface chemistry is needed.6 Precursors with aluminumnitrogen bonds could possibly reduce this 
problem 
when 
depositing 
AlN.
