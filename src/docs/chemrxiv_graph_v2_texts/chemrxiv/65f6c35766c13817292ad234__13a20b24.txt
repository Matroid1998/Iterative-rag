Description:
Used with different alkyl chain lengths in LC retention measurements.

Text:
While de Voogt et al.15,16 
used perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) and sulfonates (PFSAs) 
with different alkyl chain lengths, the PFAS of current concern 
are more diverse and thus an extension of the data set may be 
warranted. In addition, they performed the LC retention 
measurement at relatively high MeOH concentrations, primarily 
at MeOH  0.5, and extrapolated k0 over a long range, which 
could introduce substantial uncertainty in the derived k0 values. Here, we report C18LC retention factors measured for a 
vastly extended set of anionic PFAS including alternatives to 
PFOA or PFOS. Nonfluorinated compounds from three groups of 
alkyl surfactants (i.e., carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates) are also 
tested for comparison. The use of a shorter C18 column than in 
past studies15,16 allows measurement at MeOH  0.5.
