Recent ad
vancements in cheminformaticsbased machine learning (ML) 
offer chemists a way to bypass traditional Edisonian empiricism 
and develop more efficient approaches to optimizing cata
lysts.14 Several groups have reported successful demonstra
tions of MLdriven optimizations of homogeneous catalysts 
such as phosphoric acids58 and Lewisbasic ligands for metal
based catalysts involving phosphines, Nheterocyclic carbenes, 
and nitrogenbased ligands.918 
Recent progress in frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs)19,20 has ex
panded the practical and sustainable application of maingroup 
catalysis, e.g., enabling the hydrogenation of unsaturated mole
cules without toxicprecious metals.2126 In this context, the 
maingroupcatalyzed reductive alkylation of amines with car
bonyl compounds and H2 via the generation of FLP species has 
been widely accepted as a wasteminimizing process that gen
erates valuable Nalkylated amines, whereby H2O is the only 
byproduct.23,2731 Our group30 and that of Sos28 have inde
pendently shown that triarylboranes effectively catalyze the re
ductive alkylation of a variety of amines with aldehydes in the 
presence of H2.

cals,3436 the development of a straightforward and greener pro
tocol for derivatizing amino acids and peptides would be worth
while. To this end, we envisioned an MLassisted approach to iden
tify a suitable triarylborane that is able to efficiently catalyze 
the reductive alkylation of amino acids and peptides with H2 
through the construction of an insilico library that includes a 
variety of unprecedented triarylboranes. Moreover, through the 
construction of this insilico library, we aimed to contribute to 
the structural diversification of triarylboranes beyond the arche
typical B(C6F5)3,3740 which should expand the utility of this 
compound class in catalysis, materials science, and other areas. It should be noted that Dyson and Corminboeuf et al. have
