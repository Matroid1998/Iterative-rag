Description:
A crucial chemical species in biogeochemical cycles of aquatic environments.

Text:
26
Dissolved oxygen, O2, is a crucial chemical species in biogeochemical cycles of aquatic en
27
vironments and its concentration a critical parameter used for assessing ecosystem health. 28
Understanding the main processes affecting the dynamics of dissolved O2 concentrations
29
in lakes, rivers, and oceans, namely photosynthesis, respiration, and gaswater exchange,
30
is therefore key to evaluate functions of pristine and humanimpacted ecosystems.1 The
31
quantification of contributions of these three processes of O2 production, consumption, and
32
exchange to the overall O2 cycling is difficult to achieve from the monitoring and modeling
33
of O2 concentration dynamics.

Consumed in sunlit surface waters through lightdependent photochemical reactions and biological processes.

Any other O2 loss processes
43
have thus far been neglected in the evaluation of O isotope ratios. However, this view is
44
being challenged through evidence showing that in sunlit surface waters, lightdependent O2
45
consumption can occur at similar or higher rates than the lightindependent (i.e., dark)
46
respiration of O2.1420 Such O2 consumption by photochemical reactions in marine waters
47
is estimated to be of the same magnitude as photosynthetic O2 production by phytoplank
48
ton.18 Lightdependent O2 consumption can occur through biological and abiotic processes. 49
Biological, lightdependent O2 loss takes place through reduction of O2 initiated by excess
