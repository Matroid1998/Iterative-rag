Description:
Complexes with a reduction potential of 1.0-1.3 V vs SCE for Ni(II) to Ni(I) transition.

However, the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I) by the excited 
state PC (either Ir(ppy)3 or PhenO; Ered  1.66 and 1.73 V vs 
SCE respectively) is thermodynamically feasible based on 
reported cyclic voltammetry data of relevant nickel bipyridine 
complexes (EredNi(II)Ni(I)  1.01.3 V vs SCE).1112 
Furthermore, in our study with SCF3 nucleophiles, product 
yield was found to increase as the excited state reduction 
potential of the PC became more negative, while the triplet 
energy of the PCs was found to have no correlation with yield. These considerations taken together suggest that the alternate 
hypothesis of an oxidative quenching cycle (Fig. 1D) should be 
considered seriously in these systems, motivating a mechanistic 
study to distinguish between electron transfer and energy 
transfer as the mode of quenching of the Ir(ppy)3 excited state.
