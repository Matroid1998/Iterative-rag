Description:
The smallest and most extensively reported MX6 complexes.

Text:
MX6type complexes, where M is a central metal el
ement and X is a ligand, serve as excellent models for
introducing ligand field splitting  an essential factor
in predicting the electronic and spin states of transition
metal complexes. This subject is frequently discussed in
inorganic chemistry books 13. While some MX6 com
plexes exhibit the expected Oh symmetry based on their
molecular formula, the JahnTeller (JT) effect 4, 5 can
induce distortions that lead to another molecular struc
ture such as D4h symmetry. The smallest and most ex
tensively reported MX6 complexes would be MF6.

Description:
Has notable oxidation properties when M is a third-row transition metal.

This
complex garners attention not only in introductory chem
istry texts but also due to its environmental impact of
SF6 6, 7, notable oxidation properties when M is a
thirdrow transition metal 810) and UF6 in nuclear
fuel reprocessing 11, 12. A comprehensive overview of
the history and physical and chemical properties of MF6
is provided in ref 13. Traditional ligand field theory, developed for light el
ements, does not adequately capture the intricate elec
tronic behaviors exhibited by heavy transition metals. The relativistic effect is significant when describing the
chemistry of heavy elements 1419.
