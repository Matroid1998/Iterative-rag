Description:
A precious metal with limited deposits, often used in catalysis.

Text:
Furthermore, many incorporate precious metals like 
platinum and palladium,6 deposits of which are 
limited, leading to sustainability concerns,7 which 
are only partially addressed by a movement to 
earthabundant metals.8 Alternative approaches to 
homogenous catalysis include selective chiral 
poisoning 
of 
catalysts,9 
organocatalysis,1015 
reaction 
inside 
molecular 
containers 
(Supramolecular Catalysts),1624 and the use of 
enzymes2530 all can offer some measure of 
selectivity, activity, and sustainability, but often to 
varying degrees beyond a narrow range of 
reactions, substrates, or conditions.
