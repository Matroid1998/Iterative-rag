Description:
A group introduced into substrate molecules using perfluoroalkylation reagents.

Fluorinated compounds play important roles in various fields. For example, by introducing fluorine atoms 
or fluorinated substituents, the lipophilicity, solubility, acidity, and basicity of a molecule can be effectively 
improved,1 thus enabling their unique applications in pharmaceutical chemistry, 14 materials chemistry,5 
and agriculture6 (Fig. 1a). As the application of fluorinated organic compounds continues to expand, their 
synthesis has become a research focus in the field of organic chemistry, with fluoroalkylation reactions being 
an important topic in this area. In fluoroalkylation reactions, perfluoroalkylation reagent is a key to introduce a perfluoroalkyl group into 
the substrate molecule. Various organic perfluoroalkylation reagents featuring electrophilic,7 radical,8 and
