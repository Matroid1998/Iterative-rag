Description:
Can plate at the negative electrode at low temperatures, potentially leading to short circuiting.

Text:
At low temperatures slow intercalation 
kinetics can lead to lithium plating at the negative electrode which could lead to the short 
circuiting of the cell.4 At higher temperatures, a whole host of degradation processes are 
accelerated, such as dissolution of transition metals, breakdown of the solid electrolyte 
interphase, and stored lithium leaching from the graphitic electrode.5,6 These effects can 
severely damage the cell, limiting the cycle life and, in extreme cases, lead to thermal runaway, 
uncontrollable overheating, and eventually potential explosion.7
