Description:
Involved in photocycloaddition reactions with fullereneC60, with different geometric isomers studied.

Text:
Orfanopoulos and coworkers have studied extensively the photocycloaddition of 
fullereneC60 (1) to various olefins 29. These studies have delineated several aspects 
of these reactions including their stepwise nature and several other mechanistic details. One significant study involved the photocycloaddition of fullerene 1 to the three 
geometric isomers of 2,4hexadiene (2) (Figure 1) 4. From the product 4 distributions 
with the various isomers of the diene 2, the authors calculated for the proposed 
intermediate 3 a ratio of the rate of rotation about the bond that was originally a double 
bond in the diene 2 and the rate of ring closure of the intermediate 3. The present study 
reinterprets the reported data to give rate ratios that are different from the one reported.
