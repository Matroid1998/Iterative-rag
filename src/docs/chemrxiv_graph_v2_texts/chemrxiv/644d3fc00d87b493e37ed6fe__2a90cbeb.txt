Description:
A molecule where 6d and 5f orbitals hybridize to favor a bent geometry.

The uranyl ion, UO2
2, on account of its high chemical stability, is ubiquitous in uranium
chemistry. Up to a few years ago, the uranyl subunit had been characterized essentially as a
linear transoxo unit, with very few structures exhibiting Oyl UOyl bond angles deviating
(by few degrees) from linearity.1,2 The underlying cause for the predominance of linear
Oyl UOyl bonds in UO2
2 is the notable participation of the U 5f and 6p orbitals to the
UOyl bond, while in the isoelectronic ThO2 molecule 6d and 5f orbitals hybridize and
favor a bent geometry.3,4 Hratchian et al. 5 and Schreckenbach et al.
