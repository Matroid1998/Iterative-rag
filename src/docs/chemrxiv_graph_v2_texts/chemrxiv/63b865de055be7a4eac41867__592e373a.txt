Description:
Forms a surface layer on Si that can decompose and desorb at high temperatures.

Text:
Depending on 
temperature and O2 pressure (PO2), etching may be active, or result in passivation by growth of a 
thin SiO2 layer.26 At higher temperatures, SiO2 surface layers on Si can decompose and desorb 
by the reaction SiO2  Si  2 SiO(g), and even thick SiO2 can decompose and desorb as SiO, O2, 
and O at temperatures above 1800 K.7 Silicon carbide (SiC) has similar O2 etching behavior, 
losing SiO and COCO2, and passivating due to SiO2 layer growth under the right conditions.
