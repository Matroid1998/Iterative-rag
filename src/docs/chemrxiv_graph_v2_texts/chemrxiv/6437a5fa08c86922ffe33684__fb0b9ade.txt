The dextrorotatory isomer of limonene found in the peel of nearly all Citrus fruits.

Text:
Limonene (1methyl4isopropenylcyclohex1ene), namely the 
monocyclic terpene abundant in the essential oils isolated from 
the peel of nearly all Citrus fruits as the dextrorotatory isomer d
limonene (or ()limonene), is a key bioproduct of the emerging 
bioeconomy.1 The history of its identification, and ongoing 
misconceptions of the odourstructure relationship, is instructive 
also for todays chemistry educators and researchers.
