Description:
A gas molecule studied for its binding and release kinetics in NiFe hydrogenases.

Text:
This is evidence that tunnel engineering is a feasible
strategy to achieve CO and O2 tolerant hydrogenases33. Leroux et al. introduced protein film voltammetry, an experimental method that enabled
the study of kinetics of binding and release of CO and other gas molecules from NiFe
hydrogenases in a quantitative manner29. Using this technique, they quantified the diffusion of
CO, H2 and O2 inside the NiFe hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (Figure 1A)34. In the work of Liebgott et al, point mutations in this NiFe hydrogenase were introduced with
the goal of understanding how changes in the structure of the tunnels can modulate the diffusion
of gas molecules14,34. They created 10 different mutants, with mutations at positions V74 andor
L122 of the large subunit (Figure 1B).
