Description:
An oxide surface used to create a strong metal-support interaction with deposited metals.

In these 
approaches, PGMs are alloyed or doped with other metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Mo) 5,6, or are 
deposited onto an oxide surface to create a strong metalsupport interaction (e.g., PdCeOx, Ru
TiO2)7,8. Despite these efforts, few materials outperform the benchmark PtRu alloy in terms of 
both mass activity and intrinsic activity9. The interfacial water has recently been identified as an important factor that influence the kinetics 
of HORHER. Yet there is a debate on the effects of different interfacial water structures. Wang et 
al. suggested the weakly hydrogenbonded water formed an ordered structure with cations under 
biased potential, which facilitated the electron transfer and resulted in higher HER rates 10. Huang 
et al.
