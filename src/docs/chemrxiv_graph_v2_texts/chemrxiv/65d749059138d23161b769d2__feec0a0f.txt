Description:
A pentavalent hypervalent iodine compound used as a mild and selective oxidant.

Text:
11 Hypervalent iodine compounds have also been studied 
and are established in several oxidative transformations including the synthesis of 
complex molecules and drugs. 12, 13 The most prominent examples are the 
pentavalent derivatives 2Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) or DessMartinPeriodinane 
(DMP). 14, 15 Although mild and selective oxidants, these highly oxidized 5iodanes 
have drawbacks, in particular low solubility and moisture sensitivity. 11 Hypervalent 
iodine compounds in a lower oxidation state (3iodanes), such as iodosobenzene 
(PhIO)n or phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) have been reported in alcohol oxidations 
but they often result in overoxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acids. 16 The 
use of additives such as bromide salts or Al2O3 can omit this problem and allow 
selective oxidation to some extent. 1720
