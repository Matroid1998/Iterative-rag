Description:
Parts of the target in proteins used to decompose binding energy.

Text:
The latter includes molecular dock
ing, molecular dynamics simulations (MD),1 and molecular mechanics in combination with
PoissonBoltzmann or generalized Born surface area methods (MMPBSA and MMGBSA,
respectively). Molecular docking is employed to propose molecular complexes between lig
ands and a biological target, while MD is used to simulate the time evolution of the system
and to sample the conformations of each ligand within the target.2 From the sampled con
formations, MMPBSA or MMGBSA are used to estimate the binding free energy between
the ligands and the target and to decompose the binding energy into separate contributions
from each part of the target, like amino acids or nucleotides in the case of proteins and DNA,
respectively. Interaction fingerprints (IFPs) are used to condense the information from the ligand
binding.
