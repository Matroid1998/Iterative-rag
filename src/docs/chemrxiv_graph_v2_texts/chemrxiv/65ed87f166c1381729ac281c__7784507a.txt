Description:
A component of DNA that can incorporate fluorescent nucleosid analogs while maintaining Watson-Crick coupling.

Text:
Different DNA probes have been proposed in the past, yet, and 
despite their more complicated synthetic procedure, fluorescent 
nucleosid analogous (FNA); which may be directly incorporated 
in the nucleotide sequence and maintain the canonical Watson
Crick coupling, represent one of the most suitable solutions.2629 
Among FNA, 2aminopurine30,31 has been successfully used in a 
large variety of studies, despite its relatively low luminescence 
quantum yield,30 especially because it minimizes the perturbation 
to the nucleic acid structure.3234 Indeed, the tuning of 2
aminopurine fluorescence by nucleic acid environments, either 
through Watson and Crick,3537 or Hoogsten hydrogen bond,38 
has attracted considerable interest.
