(phenylmethoxy)phenyl ethyl PCA was involved in solventfree Knoevenagel 
condensation under microwave irradiation in the presence of antimony trichloride 10, 
11. 3Ethoxy2(phenylmethoxy) methyl PCA is used in preparation of methyl 2oxo2,
3dihydrobenzoboxepine4carboxylate 12. 2,3(Methylenedioxy) propyl PCA was 
involved in synthesis of 2cyano3(3,4methylene dioxyphenyl)2propionic acid ethyl 
ester 13. This compound was used for synthesis of piperonal derivatives for 
intramolecular charge transfer material related to nonlinear optics 14, 15, as well as for 
a novel Golgi mannosidase inhibitor 16. Earlier we have reported synthesis and styrene
