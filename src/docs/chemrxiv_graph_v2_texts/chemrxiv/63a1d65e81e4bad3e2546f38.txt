The interest of the research community in lignin has steadily increased over the last decades. As one of 
25 
natures largest carbon sources with an annual production of about 20 billion tons, lignin is the second 
26 
most abundant biopolymer on the planet1,2. It is available as technical lignin, which is produced as a by
27 
product in the pulp and paper industry and in smaller quantities in secondgeneration biofuel refineries. 28 
Technical lignin can be obtained through various processes. The most common are currently sulphite, 
29 
kraft, sodaanthraquinone, and various organosolv processes. The latter are newer and more 
30 
environmentally friendly ways to extract lignin from biomass. Current estimates suggest that less than 10 
31 
of all technical lignins are reused.
