Description:
Used as a leaching agent in the extraction of rare earth elements.

Text:
The leaching efficiency of ion adsorption type rare earths is usually leached by 2wt ammonium
sulfate solution with 100 rare earth content by full drenching, and the amount of rare earths leached by
other leaching agents compared to it, which is the leaching efficiency1. The leaching efficiency is
affected by the type of leaching agent, concentration, pH, leaching method, type of ore sample,
solidliquid ratio, etc. As far as leaching agents are concerned, different types of leaching agents leach
different efficiencies under the same conditions. Sun Yuanyuan2 reported that the leaching efficiencies
of different electrolytes were different at a cation concentration of 0.128 molL.
