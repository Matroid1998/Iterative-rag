Description:
A dye studied for its adsorption isotherm on groundnut shell and sorghum husk.

Text:
Diferent scienctist have model equations that quantify the amount of substance of given 
the concentration in the fuid. These equations are known as adsorption isotherms. 1.1 AIM AND OBJECTIVE
The aim of the research work is to study the adsorption Isotherm of Congo red dyes on
groundnut shell and sorghum husk. The objectiees of the reesearch work are
1. To verify the adsorption isotherm that best fts the batch adsorption data. 2
