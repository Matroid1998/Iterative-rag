Description:
Used in anodes for lithium-ion batteries, involved in evaporation process studies.

Text:
Studying experimentally the evaporation process for high solid content (SC) dispersions, as LIBs 
slurries, requires specific equipment (which often need to be built in house) and clever strategies. The group of Professor Schabel1821 published a series of experimental works aiming to investigate 
the evaporation process in graphitebased anodes. In these studies, they demonstrated that (i) high 
drying rate (HDR) leads to a gradient in binder distribution along the electrode thickness, lowering
