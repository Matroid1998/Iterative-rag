Description:
A mineral component of tooth enamel that undergoes demineralization in acidic environments.

Then, 
35 
bacteria attach to the biofilm, and the acids produced by them lead to demineralization, culminating in 
36 
caries.3 Streptococcus mutans, one of the primary bacteria associated with dental caries, can attach to 
37 
biofilm substrates and establish a strongly acidic microenvironment (pH below 5.0), thereby contributing 
38 
to hard tooth apatite demineralization and the onset of tooth decay.3 Removing biofilm by regularly 
39 
brushing the teeth and flossing is considered the most effective approach to prevent caries and other 
40 
periodontal diseases.4 However, most people fail to prevent biofilm from building up through mechanical 
41 
removal, so chemical mouth rinses are needed to inhibit bacterial growth.5 Chlorhexidine (CHD), the most 
42 
widely employed anticariogenic agent,6 has numerous unwanted effectsit can stain the teeth, irritate 
43 
the tongue, modify the taste, and cause sore mouth or throat and wheezingshortness of breath.7 
44 
Leishmaniasis, a parasitic Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) caused by protozoa of the genus 
45 
Leishmania, is estimated to lead to about 30,000 deaths annually.8 Depending on the infecting Leishmania 
46 
species and the mammalian hosts immunological and nutritional status, this disease can manifest in the 
47 
tegumentary (TL) or visceral (VL) forms.
