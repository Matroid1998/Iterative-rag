Description:
The first FDA-approved kinase inhibitor used in drug discovery for cancer treatment.

Text:
Protein kinases are ubiquitous for cell life and have become a vital source of targets for drug
discovery after the FDA approval of the first kinase inhibitor, imatinib, 20 years ago13. By
2021, about 60 kinase inhibitors have received market approval4 and helped to enrich our
treatment options for cancer and, more recently, also neurodegenerative or viral diseases4. Despite this success, most research has focused on narrow fractions of the kinome revealing
therapeutic utility5,6. The characteristics of the target family that led drug discovery re
searchers to avoid kinases for many years (e.g., binding site similarity and sheer size3) make
the family an ideal candidate to exploit this similarity systematically with proteochemomet
ric approaches. 2
