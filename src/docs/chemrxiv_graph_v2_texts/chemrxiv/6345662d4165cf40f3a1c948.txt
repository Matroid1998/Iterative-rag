Description:
Used in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral-alkaline solutions.

Text:
Transition metal phosphates (TMPs) have been gaining interest as materials for catalysis, 
electrocatalysis and electrochemistry due to their lowcost, stability, and tunability 14. For 
instance, it has been reported that the performance of iron, nickel, and cobalt phosphates in 
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutralalkaline solutions is comparable to IrO2RuO2. Ni and NixCo1x phosphates demonstrate excellent supercapacitor characteristics 5, 6, zirconium 
and vanadium phosphates are used in organic catalysis, and silver phosphate in photocatalysis 
79. The chemical stability of TMPs over a wide range of temperatures makes them ideal 
candidates e.g. for fuel cell applications (optimal Trange for many fuel cells 150C  T  350C 
10 ) and electrolysis 1114. Typically, TMPs are synthesized by precipitation from solution, hydrothermal methods, 
molten salt, microwave, or mechanochemical syntheses 1520.
