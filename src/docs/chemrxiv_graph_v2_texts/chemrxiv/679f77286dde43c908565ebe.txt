Description:
A durable transition element with antimicrobial activity, used as antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal.

Text:
Metallic Silver (Ag) is the 67th abundant among the elements and is a durable transition element. Due 
to its rarity and attractive metallic luster silver has been used as jewelry, currency coins and other 
valuable items. In ancient times silver utensils were used to keep the water and wine clean. Silver 
finds its applications in medicine, as due to its antimicrobial activity silver is used as antibacterial, 
antiviral, and antifungal. In the 17th and 18th century Silve Nitrate (AgNO3) was applied to treat ulcers 
1. 1 Silver Nitrate was introduced as an eye solution to prevent conjunctivitis in small children 2. Silver Sulfadiazine in its tropical form is used to treat burn wounds 3.

Description:
Releases slowly from AgNPs, contributing to biocidal action.

Text:
Silver performed excellent due to its antimicrobial properties and when 
enhanced using Nanotechnology the limitation of silver in its pure state were overcome. These nano 
synthesized silver materials were having smaller size (in nm range) which enhanced its surface area, 
that in turn improves its reactivity. AgNPs showed biocidal action by slowly releasing Ag that results in
