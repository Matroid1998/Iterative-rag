Description:
The reduced form of NAD produced by Rh(III)arene complexes.

Unfortunately, no correlation between activity in NMR experiments and in cells could be 
observed13, probably due to catalyst poisoning or side reactions in the cellular environment. In 2012, Hollman et al. reported a modified heterogenic Rh(III)Noyori type catalyst capable of 
reducing NAD, proving that the compounds could potentially be used for regeneration of NADH14. Further 
studies on Rh(III)arene complexes showed that they can reduce NAD to 1,4NADH and pyruvate to lactate, 
using formate as the hydride source, under biologicallyrelevant conditions11. Pyruvate is an important 
intermediate in metabolic pathways in cells; it is the endproduct of glycolysis, and is ultimately destined for 
transport into mitochondria as a pivotal fuel input sustaining the Krebs cycle15. Hence, disturbance of pyruvate 
metabolism is expected to generate metabolic disorder.
