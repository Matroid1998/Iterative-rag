Description:
Used in conventional approaches to attain superhydrophobicity by combining with surface roughness techniques.

Superhydrophobicity is characterized by extreme waterrepellency and selfcleaning behavior, 
13 which can be observed in nature among plants and animals, enabling them to stay clean 
and dry in variable conditions.4 The Lotus effect, which imparts the selfcleaning ability of 
superhydrophobic structures, was first presented by Barthlott and Neinhuis in 1997.5 The key 
to achieving superhydrophobicity lies in combining hierarchical surface structures and low 
surface energy materials.6 These surface structuring and roughness, at the nano to microscale 
range, cause the water drop to appear in CassieBaxter state, in which air is trapped between 
the water droplets and the surface.7 To qualify a surface as superhydrophobic, it should have 
a water contact angle exceeding 150 and a rolling angle of less than 10.8 Another known 
method to characterize a surface as superhydrophobic is low contact angle hysteresis (lower 
than 10).9 The application of superhydrophobicity is significant in many fields, including 
marine, aerospace, medical devices, and textiles.10 These applications are based on unique 
properties, in addition to selfcleaning,11,12 including antiicing,13,14 facilitation of oilwater 
separation,15 corrosion resistance,16 and drag reduction.17 Conventional approaches to attain 
superhydrophobicity typically involve combining chemical surface modifications or 
coatings,18,19 fluorinated materials,2022 or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 2326 with making 
surface roughness by etching 2729 and molding techniques which enable the creation of 
micropatterns on the surface.3032 These methods usually require multistep fabrication 
processes,33 and there is an unmet need for a simple fabrication process.
