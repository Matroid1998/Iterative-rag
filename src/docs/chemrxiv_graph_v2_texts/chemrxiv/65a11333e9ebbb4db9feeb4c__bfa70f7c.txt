Description:
A prototypical pseudohalide anion commonly found as a ligand in molecular metallocomplexes and as an organic functional group.

Text:
Thiocyanate is one of the prototypical pseudohalide anions and
it can be found in every area of contemporary chemistry,1,2 most
commonly as a ligand in molecular metallocomplexes,3 but also
as an organic functional group4, in biological chemistry as a key
metabolite5 with potential anticarcinogenic function6, and even
in space7. The study of thiocyanate has a long history.

Description:
A compound used to prepare sulferetted chyazate salts of various elements.

Text:
NCS
was first prepared and isolated by Porrett in 1814, well before
the isolation of elemental bromine, fluorine and iodine.8,9 In
this pioneering work, Porrett used HNCS to prepare sulferetted
chyazate salts of a number of elements, including K, Na, Ca,
Al, Ba, Sr, Ag, Hg, Cu, Pb, Sn, Bi, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, Pd, U, Mo and
Cr.8 Porretts work highlights not only the diversity of thiocyanate
chemistry but also how much is yet to be determined about metal
thiocyanate chemistry although these compounds were reported
more than two hundred years ago, the synthesis and structures of
Pd, U, Mo, Al and Cr thiocyanate have not been confirmed.

Description:
Both N and S-bound in binary frameworks.

Text:
In most of the described binary frame
works thiocyanate is both N and Sbound and for these M(NCS)x is used without
implying anything about the local bonding. Other older trivial names for thiocyanate include rhodanide and sulfocyanide. of thiocyanate in solution or with coligands has been excluded
as it is wellcovered elsewhere.3,12,13 The review summarizes the
chemistry of the binary M(NCS)x for every nonradioactive metal,
and the structure of every ternary metal thiocyanate MM(NCS)x. Special attention has been paid to the structural analogies be
tween metal thiocyanates and other inorganic solidstate com
pounds. I have relied, in addition to the primary literature,
on two book chapters Golub, Khler and Skopenko (1986)14
and Williams (1948),15 which are the most comprehensive sum
maries of metal thiocyanate chemistry thus far published.

Description:
A rigid linear anion.

Text:
The
review begins with a general overview of metal thiocyanates high
lighting characteristic trends. It then moves onto a description of
the chemistry of binary metal thiocyanates, describing first the
five structural families before summarising what is known about
the binary metal thiocyanates without reported crystal structures. The structures of the ternary metal thiocyanates are then de
scribed, being classified first by framework dimensionality and
then by characteristic structural features. The review concludes
with a brief summary and prospectus of the potential of inorganic
metal thiocyanate chemistry. 1.1
Structural chemistry
Thiocyanate is a rigid linear anion.

Description:
A stiff ligand with small deviations from linearity and variations in bond lengths.

Text:
The key contrasts in the struc
tural chemistry between the atomic halides anion and linear thio
cyanate arise therefore from the additional degrees of freedom
introduced by moving from a sphere to a rod. The most im
portant new degree of freedom is the orientation of the NCS
ligand. This can be parameterized by the MNC and MSC an
gles for a bridging thiocyanate ligand. As thiocyanate is stiff, the
intramolecular degrees of freedom are less important, and devi
ations from linearity and variations in the bond lengths (despite
the two distinct resonance structures) are typically small.
