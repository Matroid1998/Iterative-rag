Description:
Used as a sacrificial donor in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution systems.

Text:
Many polymers and polymer nanoparticles such as Pdots have shown that they have sat
isfactory photocatalytic hydrogen production even without the addition of a cocatalyst912. Since most of the polymers are synthesized by a coupling reaction in the presence of a
Palladium(Pd)catalyst13,14, some Pd is typically trapped in the polymers and acts as co
catalysts. Kosco et al. have studied the effect of residual Pd remaining from synthesis on
the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in (poly(9,9dioctylfluorenealt1,2,3
benzothiadiazole) (F8BT or PFBT) and found that the photocatalytic activity has been
completely inhibited when the polymer has less than 1 ppm Pd in the systems with 30V
of diethyl amine (DEA) as the sacrificial donor (SD)15.
