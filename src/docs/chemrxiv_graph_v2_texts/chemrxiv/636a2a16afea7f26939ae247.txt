Description:
Reacts with lithiated 1,4diphenyl 1,2,3triazole.

Text:
In 1971, Raap reported the lithiation of 1,4diphenyl
1,2,3triazole, followed by reaction with methyl iodide or carbon 
dioxide.7a Rapp also demonstrated that the lithiated triazole 
intermediate was prone to decomposition above 10 C, resulting 
in extrusion of N2 and formation of an Nphenylketenimine anion. Ohta subsequently demonstrated an expanded electrophile 
scope for the lithiationfunctionalisation of Nmethyl1,2,3
triazole,7b whilst Holzer and Begtrup have reported directed 
lithiations using Nalkoxymethyl and Nbenzyloxy1,2,3triazole,
