Description:
A compound that can exist in three different redox states through aromatic-quinoid-aromatic transitions.

Sev
eral strategies have been employed to enhance their con
ductivity, such as redoxmatching of the building blocks,
the use of mixedvalence metal nodes and ligands, or the
introduction of conducting guests into the pore 2226. Engineering highperforming MOFs for a desired applica
tion involves searching the vast configuration space of metal
nodes, linkers and ligands. Among the large list of redox
active ligands used to promote conductivity in porous frame
works, dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq) and its derivatives
stand promising to engender mixedvalence MOFs due to
their ability to exist in three different redox states through
aromaticquionidaromatic transitions (Figure 1) 27. The
3charge state is a radical and thus carries a spin com
pared to the diamagnetic 2and 4states.

Description:
A ligand used in metal-organic frameworks for effective metal-ligand coordination and charge transport.

Text:
The orbitals
of the ligand are energetically matched with transition metal
3dorbitals, enabling effective metalligand coordination and
longrange conjugated pathways along the framework struts
for efficient charge transport 28. The magnetoelectronic properties of three MOFs using
dhbq as their ligand have been investigated experimentally 29,30. The conductivities of Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 and
V2(Cl2dhbq)3 were found to be 2.7  103 Scm, 1.4  102
Scm and 0.45 Scm, respectively. These are high values
compared to other MOFs, especially V2(Cl2dhbq)3 which is
one of the most conducting frameworks based on oxodonor
linkers reported to date. Optical spectroscopy indicated
a high degree of electronic delocalisation in V2(Cl2dhbq)3,
which led to a classification as a RobinDay class III mixed
valence compound, whereas Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3
were classified as class II.
