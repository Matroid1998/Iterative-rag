Description:
Part of the boron pnictides family with predicted superdense hexagonal structures.

1b displays the two alternating carbon sites, 
represented by brown and white spheres, with the structural parameters provided in Table 1b, which 
shows the same interatomic distances and cell volume (cf. Table 1a) during the transformation from 
C8 to (C1)4(C2)4. Very recently, we have ab initio predicted superdense hexagonal boron pnictides BX (X  N, P, As, 
Sb, Bi) with quartz (qtz) topology 1012. In the present work, we used the (C1)4(C2)4 template 
structure to predict and investigate within DFT a new family of tetragonal equiatomic boron 
pnictides BX with crb topology that exhibit only BX bonds, avoiding energetically unfavorable 
BB or XX bonds. Fig. 1d displays the square B2X2 motif that characterizes these structures, 
along with the resulting edge and cornersharing BX4 tetrahedra.
