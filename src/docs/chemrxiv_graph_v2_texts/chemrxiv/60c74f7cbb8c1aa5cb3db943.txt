Description:
A gas enriched in the para nuclear spin isomer used in chemical reactions.

Text:
A molecular precursor is chemically reacted 
with hydrogen gas enriched in the para nuclear spin 
isomer, and this is followed by a magnetic field cycle22,23 to 
transfer the para spin order from the hydrogen nuclei to the 
13C nucleus in fumarate. It is necessary to polarize the 13C 
nucleus for in vivo imaging because the hyperpolarized 13C 
nuclei relax back to thermal equilibrium slower than 1H 
nuclei, and have a large chemical shift dispersion which 
allows chemical selectivity. The drawback to producing 
hyperpolarized fumarate via PHIP is that, in addition to the 
desired fumarate product, the reaction solutions contain a 
plethora of additional chemicals; most notably the 
ruthenium catalyst, unreacted reagents, and reaction side 
product molecules.
