Description:
Materials with exceptional chemical stability and high porosity.

Text:
ZIFs mimic the tetrahedral units (TO4, T  Si or Al) in zeolites through coordination 
bonds formed between fourcoordinated metal cations and imidazolates (Im, hereafter).4 These 
materials hold the potential to supplement the zeolite ecosystems due to exceptional chemical 
stability and high porosity.4,15 Despite strong attention to utilizing ZIFs, there are only 38 
known ZIF topologies,6,45 significantly fewer than 255 realized zeolites.17 Even with extensive
