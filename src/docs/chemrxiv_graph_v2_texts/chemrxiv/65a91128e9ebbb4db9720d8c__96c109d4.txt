Description:
A pure form synthesized using dibenzyldimethylammonium and detemplated by treatment at 110 C in an O3 stream.

Text:
synthesized pure silica zeolite Beta using
dibenzyldimethylammonium and detemplated it by a treatment at 110 C in an O3 stream followed
by washing with hot acetone.9 The motivation for that treatment was to avoid the formation of
difficult to remove coke when the zeolite was calcined in air at high temperature.10 Despite the
considerable diffusion of that paper (it was the first report on the long sought synthesis of pure
silica Beta), the O3 treatment passed quite unnoticed for several years and, in fact, none of the first
several subsequent papers on the O3 mediated removal of the OSDA (frequently called
detemplation) has cited this seminal work, to our surprise.
