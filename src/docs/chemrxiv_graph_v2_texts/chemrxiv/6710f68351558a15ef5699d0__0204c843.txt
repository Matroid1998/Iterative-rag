Description:
Serve as masks for payloads that can be uncaged in biological settings.

Text:
Yet, 
a diverse array of payloads, including carboxylates, amines, 
phenols and thiols, masked as esters, carbonates and 
carbamates can be uncaged in biological settings via 
a competition of two mechanisms  phootoxidation and 
photoheterolysis.37,41 Unfortunately, a direct photoheterolysis 
of carboxylates (Figure 1A) is negligible, i.e., the presence of 
oxygen to facilitate the phootoxidation is inevitable for the 
release.37 The implementation of these Cy7 photocages in 
control of live human cardiomyocytes41 and concurrent 
delivery of payloads with a subcellular precision42 underscore 
their broad application potential.
