Description:
Used as a C1 feedstock in hydrogenation to methanol.

Text:
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green H2 offers an attractive route to mitigate CO2 
emissions and store excess electricity obtained from intermittent renewable energy.13 Extensive efforts 
have focused on using Cubased catalysts to convert CO2 to methanol, since similar catalysts are already 
commercially implemented in established syngas (COH2)tomethanol processes.48 However, when 
CO2 is used in place of CO as a C1 feedstock, the Cubased catalysts suffer from limited activity, 
methanol selectivity and rapid deactivation as a consequence of the additional water produced.9 Thus,
