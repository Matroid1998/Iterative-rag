Description:
A key element in hydrogen evolution reactions, where its production is influenced by catalyst availability and cost.

Text:
The necessity for nonplatinum catalysts in the context of hydrogen evolution is predominantly 
driven by the limited availability and substantial cost of platinum, which is currently the most 
effective catalyst for this reaction 1. This costeffectiveness issue renders largescale hydrogen 
production economically unfeasible. Schiff base (iRCNRii) ligands have emerged as compelling 
alternatives due to their affordability, accessibility as precursors, adaptability to desired properties, 
and ease of synthesis. A Schiff base ligand is a compound characterized by a double bond between 
a carbon and nitrogen atom 2. This bond is formed through the condensation reaction of an 
aldehyde or ketone with a carbonyl group with a nitrogenbased compound.

Description:
Generated through the process of proton reduction.

The capacity to 
promptly establish coordination with transition metals is paramount for the effective facilitation 
of proton reduction, a process that culminates in the generation of hydrogen gas 3. The formation of Schiff bases metal complexes occurs through a process of lone pair donation 
from the nitrogen atom (from the imine group, CN) to a metal ion 4. This process essentially 
functions as a ligand, thereby coordinating with the metal center through the electronrich site. The 
structural characteristics of Schiff bases permit the existence of multiple coordination sites 5, 
thus facilitating the formation of stable complexes with various metal ions, contingent upon the 
specific design of the ligand.
