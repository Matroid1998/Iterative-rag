Description:
An insulator that can be represented by small unit cells with only a few atoms.

As a result, studying electronic excitations in complex disordered systems
remains a challenge for ab initio methods. ManyBody Greens Functions Theory in the GW approximation and BetheSalpeter
Equation (BSE) has often been considered the method of choice for the calculation
of electronically excited states (both charged and neutral) in hard condensed matter
systems 1, 2, 3, starting from a meanfield groundstate reference often obtained
from densityfunctional theory 4, 5 (DFT). Early studies in the late 1990s of inorganic
crystals such as elementary semiconductors, or insulators such as magnesium oxide
or lithium fluoride have been tractable because the atomic structure of these materials
can be represented by small unit cells with only a few atoms 6.
