Description:
A class of compounds dominated by smaller species with 2 to 3 rings.

The molecular distribution typically 
40 
ranges from 16 to 1000 amu.4 The number of unique compounds is extensive and more than 
41 
240 000 molecular species have been resolved in a single sample.5,6 Due to this complexity, a 
42 
large portion of the petroleum chemical space is structurally unknown. 43 
We have previously looked at the resins fraction (i.e. larger heteroatomcontaining species) of 
44 
North Sea oils.7 Herein, we extend our work with a focus on aromatics. Within this fraction, 
45 
the dominant species (in terms of abundance) are monoaromatic followed by a smaller 
46 
amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).8,9 The PAHs class is dominated by 
47 
smaller (2 to 3 rings) PAHs, with larger species (e.g. chrysene, coronene) being present at 
48 
trace levels.
