Description:
Alloy nanoparticles used for emission control and as catalysts in fuel cells, known for increased stability against aging.

Text:
PdPt alloy nanoparticles (NPs) are most prominently used for emission control but also
find application for CO and methane oxidation and as catalyst in fuel cells.1,2 The use of an
alloy increases the stability of the NPs against aging Pure Pt NPs sinter and decrease in
their catalytic efficiency in the process, but the addition of Pd slows this process, making the
catalysts last longer36 and possibly increasing the catalytic activity.7 In emission control,
the PdPt nanoparticles are often supported by Al2O3 due to its good thermal and mechanical
stability as well as the high surface area that is achieved when a porous Al2O3 structure is
used.5,8
The catalytic activity is controlled by the active sites of the NPs.9 To study these, model
systems with good control over all structural parameters are used.
