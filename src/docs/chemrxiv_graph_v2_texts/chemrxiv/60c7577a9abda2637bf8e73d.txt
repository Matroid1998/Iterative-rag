of desired substitutions at the 
nucleobase often requires complete or partial resynthesis of 
the target molecule since a general strategy for the efficient 
diversification of modified nucleosides has not been 
reported to date (Scheme 1, top). With the advent of scalable 
routes for the de novo synthesis of selected 4modified 
nucleoside analogs, as reported recently by Britton,21 such 
a diversification strategy would readily provide access to a 
variety of soughtafter nucleosides. We envisioned that nucleoside phosphorylases could 
provide a biocatalytic platform for latestage diversification 
of 4modified nucleosides.
