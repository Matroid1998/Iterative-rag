Description:
Synthesized using enzymes such as hydrolases, nitriles hydratases, and transglutaminases.

Additionally, enzymatic 
reactions typically occur in aqueous medium under mild 
conditions. Industrially, amides have been synthesized using 
mainly hydrolases (such as lipases, esterases, and acylases), 
nitriles hydratases, and transglutaminases.11 In addition, the 
repertoire of enzymes known to catalyze the amide bond 
formation includes thioesterases (TEs) from both polyketide 
synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) 
systems, standalone adenylation domains (SAADs), carboxylic 
acid reductases (CARs), amidebond synthetases (ABSs), AMP
ligating enzymes and acylcoenzyme A ligases (ACLs).1120 
ACLs are enzymes belonging to the adenylateforming enzyme 
superfamily, which comprises acyl and aryl CoA synthetases, 
nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and luciferases, being 
responsible for a variety of biological processes.
