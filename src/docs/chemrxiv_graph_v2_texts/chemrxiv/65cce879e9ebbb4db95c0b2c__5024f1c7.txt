Description:
The chemical formula for pyrene.

We will see that Gavilan et al., 2022, in 
the case of pyrene generated nanograins, obtained a spectrum which looks like that of biochar. We will 
also consider the results obtained by Smith et al., 2016, about their proposal of a structural analysis of 
char made by means of Raman spectroscopy. Pyrene 
As told by Gavilan et al., 2022, PAHs are a class of aromatic organic molecules that are ubiquitous on 
Earth, in the solar system, and in the interstellar medium. PAHs are playing important roles in the 
evolution of the cosmic environments (Gavilan et al., 2022). Pyrene (C16H10), is the smallest peri
condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Gavilan and coworkers used Raman spectroscopy 
to characterize pyrene in microcrystals and in pyrenederived nanograins.
