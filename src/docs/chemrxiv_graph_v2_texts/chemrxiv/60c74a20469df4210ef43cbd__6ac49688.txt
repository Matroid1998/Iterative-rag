Description:
A biological thiol implicated in a variety of diseases.

Text:
Biological thiols such as (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH), are essential in biological systems. They play a key role in protein structures and control redox homeostasis. Abnormal levels of biological
thiols are implicated in a variety of diseases such as cancers for example with GSH. 1. Hence, thiol
containing molecules such as Glutathione (GSH) or cysteine (Cys), aim generally at detoxifying metals
according to the literature. 2 3 4 For example, GSH a thiol containing peptides is produced in human
cells for the detoxication of poisonous metals such as cadmium. 5 Even if it is well accepted that GSH
detoxify metals, the coordination modes are numerous and dier depending on metals. Moreover, very
few modes are reported for precious metals such as Ruthenium or Palladium.
