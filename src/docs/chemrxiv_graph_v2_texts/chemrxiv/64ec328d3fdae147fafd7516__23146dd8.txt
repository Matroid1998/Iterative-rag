Description:
Cations that have raised magnetic blocking temperatures closer to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.

Raising the temperatures at which singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) exhibit magnetic remanence is key to 
unlocking their potential applications in highdensity data storage, as the liquid helium cooling currently 
required is expensive.13 For the last two decades lanthanide (Ln) SMMs have shown the most promise to 
achieve this goal,47 with axial dysprosium complexes predicted to show the highest energy barriers to 
magnetic reversal (Ueff).810 As the isolation of an ideal axial twocoordinate linear Dy(III) complex is a 
major synthetic challenge, pentagonal bipyramidal Dy complexes with strongly donating apical alkoxides 
and five weak equatorial donor ligands were the first SMMs to achieve Ueff values  1000 K.11 Salts with 
axial dysprosocenium cations Dy(CpR)2 (CpR  substituted cyclopentadienyl) and related derivatives 
subsequently raised 100 s magnetic blocking temperatures (TB) evercloser to the boiling point of liquid 
nitrogen (77 K);1222 this was attributed to the rigidity of the coordinated aromatic ligands hindering Raman 
magnetic relaxation pathways.12,23 The current recordholding SMM Dy2(C5iPr5)2(I)3 contains a 1e 
DyDy bond, and has Ueff  2345(36) K and TB  72 K.19
