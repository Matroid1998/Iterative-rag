decades.1,2 Another example of an felement system with contested metal ON is PuO2,
which is the subject of the present study. PuO2 is solid under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in the flourite (CaF2) struc
ture and features eightcoordinate plutonium with cubic site symmetry and four
coordinate oxygen sites. PuO2 would appear to be a straightforward case of assign
ing Pu4 and O2 formal ion charges, along with Pu(IV) and O(II) oxidation numbers
(ONs) and an openshell Pu 5f 4 electron configuration. The number of openshell elec
trons is therefore nopen  4.

Description:
Has a magnetic susceptibility consistent with a 5f 4 configuration and a nonmagnetic ground state.

Text:
The magnetic susceptibility of PuO2 as a function of tem
perature is fully consistent with the assigned 5f 4 configuration and a nonmagnetic
ground state,3,4 although it took several decades of theoretical modeling to under
stand why the magnetic susceptibility is effectively constant in the temperature range
11000 K.5,6 A recent publication by Tobin et al.7 assigned the Pu ion in PuO2 as having
a 5f 5 configuration, however, and therefore a Pu(III) ion, based on Xray spectroscopic
measurements and accompanying model calculations. The present study was carried out to demonstrate that there is considerable ligand
tometal (LM) donation in PuO2, which leads to excess electron density in the 5f shell of
Pu.
