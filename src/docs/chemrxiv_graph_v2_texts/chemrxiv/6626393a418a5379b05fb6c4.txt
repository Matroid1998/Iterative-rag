Description:
Has a van der Waals radius that contributes to a separation distance of 3.4 Ã… when stacked in conjugated molecules.

Text:
Over the past few decades, many studies have been conducted on conjugated molecules, which 
have unique electronic properties based on an effective electron delocalization.1,2 Since conjugated 
molecules with rigid and planar structures, in general, have porbitals overhanging perpendicular to the 
molecular plane, stacking of two or more molecular planes can affect the molecular orbitals themselves, 
leading to significant changes in physical properties such as absorption properties.3,4 Therefore, when 
two conjugated units are close to a separation distance of 3.4  (the sum of van der Waals (vdW) radii 
of carbon atoms) or less by a stacked structure that can induce an interaction between their molecular 
orbitals by forming new orbitals through linear combination of the components, it is expected that they 
could exhibit unprecedented properties that are not seen with monomeric conjugated units.
