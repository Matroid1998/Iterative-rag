Description:
Involved in the hydrogenation process using Cu-based catalysts to synthesize methanol.

Text:
This process can yield various products, ranging from CO, via the so
3 
called Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) reaction,1, 2 to methane by the Sabatier reaction.3 It can also 
4 
yield intermediate compounds like methanol or even higher hydrocarbon or alcohol products via the 
5 
FischerTropsch process.47 However, the hydrogenation of CO2 towards valueadded chemicals like 
6 
methanol is notoriously more challenging when compared to the hydrogenation of CO, despite both 
7 
processes sharing common catalytically active materials, reaction conditions and similar reaction 
8 
mechanisms.8, 9 The most prominent example is the hydrogenation of CO or CO2 using Cubased 
9 
catalysts, which favor methanol synthesis via formate and methoxy intermediates, while hardly 
10 
producing methane under a wide range of conditions.10 Aiming at improving the catalytic performance, 
11 
large research efforts have been directed at identifying socalled promoters to improve product 
12 
selectivity.
