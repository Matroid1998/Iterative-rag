Description:
An insensitive nucleus whose NMR signals can be enhanced using the SABRE method.

Text:
The 
SABRE method can be used to enhance NMR signals of protons6, 
7, and insensitive nuclei such as 15N and 13C 815 and to polarize 
various molecules, notably, biomolecules1618, metabolites19 
and drugs2022. Both hydrogenative PHIP and SABRE have been successfully 
applied to hyperpolarize various compounds; however, the 
optimization of hyperpolarization experiments still remains 
challenging. Specifically, reaction conditions have to be 
optimized, as well as polarization transfer efficiency. In this 
work, we address one more issue, which turns out to be 
important in both PHIP and SABRE. Specifically, we address the 
question What is the spin order of H2 in PHIPSABRE 
experiments?.
