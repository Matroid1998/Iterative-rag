Description:
Toxic to reproduction.

Text:
Plastics themselves once created are described as nontoxic and feign no threats
to human health and the environment because of their nonreactive disposition
and generally are nontransferrable across biological membranes due to their
large sizes 7. Unfortunately, plastics are seldom used by themselves in their pure
states 5, and typically, the polymer resins are aggregated with various additives
to enhance the performance, functionality, and aging properties of the polymer 8. These
numerous
additives
together
with
nonpolymeric
substances
like
monomers or small oligomers, low molecular weight fragments, polymerization
solvents, and catalyst remnants are hazardous to human health and the
environment with persistent effects, e.g., styrene and vinyl chloride monomers are
carcinogenic and mutagenic respectively while BPA is toxic to reproduction 7, 9.
