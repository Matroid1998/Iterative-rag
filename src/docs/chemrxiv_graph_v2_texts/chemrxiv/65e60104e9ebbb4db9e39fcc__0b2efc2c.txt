Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the primary contributor to global warming 
and climate change, posing significant challenges to our world.1 Traditional CO2 capture 
methods using aminebased solvents or solid sorbents require energyintensive temperature 
swing regeneration processes, which suffer from low energy efficiencies and short material 
lifetimes.2 Electrochemical CO2 capture is an emerging decarbonization approach that uses the 
charging and discharging of an electrochemical cell to drive CO2 capture and release.3 This 
approach employs electricity as the sole driving force and has the potential to become an 
energyefficient and lowcost method to capture CO2 at room temperature.3 A range of 
electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are under development including those based on 
electrochemicallydriven pH swings,46 redoxactive CO2binding molecules,710 and 
electrochemically mediated amine regeneration.1113 Key challenges for these electrochemical 
approaches include the use of critical materials,14 cell degradation,6 O2 sensitivity,10 and low 
CO2 capture capacities and rates.15 
Among the various electrochemical CO2 capture technologies, aqueous supercapacitors 
appear promising due to their use of lowcost, abundant and sustainable materials, long cycle 
lifetimes, high energy efficiencies and fast charging kinetics.16 These devices reversibly capture 
CO2 when charged through an effect known as supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA).16 The 
device configuration features a symmetric supercapacitor cell with two identical porous 
activated carbon electrodes and an aqueous electrolyte, and the cell is contacted with a CO2
containing gas at one electrode (Figure 1).17 While the exact molecular mechanism of CO2 
capture by these systems remains under investigation, the mechanism of capture likely involves 
chargingdriven perturbations to the below equilibria17
