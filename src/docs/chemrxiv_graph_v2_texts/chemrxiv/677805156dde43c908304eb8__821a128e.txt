Description:
A MOF where smaller crystal size increases the gate opening penalty and decreases system flexibility.

Text:
Gas adsorption in MOFs can be accompanied by unique 
and often counterintuitive structural changes within the porous framework due to a complex 
interplay of inter and intramolecular interactions of both, the adsorbate as well as the 
adsorbent.4,5 This flexibility also sets them apart from other classes of porous materials such as 
porous carbons or zeolites and lead to a variety of analytic methods providing deep insights in the 
underlying mechanisms on a molecular scale.59 
Besides these molecular level construction and interactions, crystal size has shown to have an 
impact on the adsorption behaviour of MOFs as well.1014 In many cases, the decrease in crystal 
size and thereby the decreased ratio of inner surface compared to the crystals outer surface leads 
to a stabilization of a metastable open pore phase due to a lack of nucleation sites required for the 
phase transition.15 This influences the thermodynamics and kinetics of the physisorption process 
and the possibly underlying flexible transitions.11,15 Various groups have found that smaller 
crystal size in ZIF8 increases the gate opening penalty and therefore overall decreases the 
flexibility of this system.13,16,17 On the other hand larger crystals oftentimes show more internal 
strain due to a larger number of differently oriented domains within the crystal.11,18 This is also 
reflected by computational studies which suggest that the flexible breathing transition of MIL
53(Al) can occur via a layerbylayer mechanism as well as one involving multiple discrete 
nucleation points, depending also on external pressure.14 This leads to altered kinetics of the phase 
transition as in MIL53(Al) a slower breathing transition with increasing crystal size but also a
