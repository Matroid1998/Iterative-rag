Text:
The mechanical properties of substratesupported thin films are commonly studied by nanoindentation
tests.15,16 However, this method has a lower limit on the film thickness, which should exceed 10 times
the indentation depth to avoid interference from the substrate. As an alternative approach, microbulge
tests have been used to probe the mechanical properties of freestanding membranes from different ma
terials, such as carbon nanosheets,17 titania nanocrystals (TNCs),18 and gold nanoparticles.19 Using
bulge experiments, the elastic properties are sampled nondestructively over a larger area compared to
local nanoindentation tests. In a recent study, we applied microbulge tests to measure the elastic prop
