Description:
Used in diastereoselective alkylation with NBocLglutamic acid dimethyl ester.

Text:
The established strategy for preparing 3 utilizes a 
chiral pool approach; NBocLglutamic acid dimethyl ester is 
doubly deprotonated at 78 C with excess LiHMDS, then 
treated with bromoacetonitrile resulting in diastereoselective al
kylation (Scheme 1B).1012 While this method is elegant, it 
incurs cost in several ways, including the requirement for cryo
genics conditions and excess LiHMDS, both of which are ex
pensive on such large scales. Subsequent reports have studied 
modifications of this alkylation, however, none have addressed 
the limitations described above.13, 14 Considering this, develop
ment of a noncryogenic and scalable route for the synthesis of 
3 is desirable. An alternate option to the established chiral pool approach 
described above, would be to develop a catalytic asymmetric 
reaction to prepare fragment 3, or precursors thereof (Scheme 
1C).
