Description:
A molecule that can undergo reduction in photoelectrochemical cells.

The development of an efficient dyesensitized photoelectrochemical (DSPEC) cell can 
contribute to mitigating energy and environmental challenges via converting and storing solar 
energy into chemical bonds.15 However, the overall efficiency of the DSPEC cell is limited by 
severe charge recombination at the photocathode, which has a substantially lower performance 
than the photoanode.67 In a dyesensitized photocathode, a monolayer of a molecular dye is 
anchored onto the surface of a ptype semiconductor and functions as the light absorber. A 
catalyst for proton or CO2 reduction can be linked to the dye, coadsorbed on the semiconductor 
or even dissolved into the electrolyte. 811 Lightinduced charge separation by hole injection from 
the dye into the valence band of the semiconductor should be followed by electron transfer to 
the catalyst.
