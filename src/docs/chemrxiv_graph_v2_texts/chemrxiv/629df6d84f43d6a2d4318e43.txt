Description:
The atom whose maximum intensity of descriptors shifted to atom O.

4 where parameter q was set to be 1 for all atoms), the de
scriptors drawn for atom O and H could not be well separated
and the sign of charge information was totally lost, as shown in
Figure 3(c)  Figure 3(e). For the angular symmetry functions,
with the phase parameter  switched between 1 and 1, the
maximum intensity of the descriptors shifted from atom H to O
(Figure 3(d) and Figure 3(e)). It is a compensate, hence, we uti
lized both values to obtain good descriptors at different values of
