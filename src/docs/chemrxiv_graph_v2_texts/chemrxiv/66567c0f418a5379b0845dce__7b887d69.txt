Description:
Commonly used as masked thioester surrogates in FmocSPPS.

Text:
Since the inception of NCL three decades ago,6,7 CPS has grown from a 
specialty technique into a field of its own, with dedicated international conferences8 as well as a 
10 
publicly available Protein Chemical Synthesis Database (PCSdb) with information on hundreds 
of synthesized proteins reported in literature.9 As the community grows and aims for larger and 
more diverse protein targets, the field needs data science tools to manage the complexity of 
information in a typical CPS project. The scope of CPS is continually widening thanks to many important chemical advances 
15 
over the years. Peptide thioesters, the required starting materials for NCL, can be readily 
produced by common FmocSPPS as masked thioester surrogates (most commonly hydrazides10
12).
