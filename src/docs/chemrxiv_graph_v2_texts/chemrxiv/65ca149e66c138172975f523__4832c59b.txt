Description:
Exhibit strong excitonic binding energies, large carrier mobilities, and high extinction coefficients.

Text:
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), especially twodimensional monolayers, exhibit 
strong excitonic binding energies (300 meV), large carrier mobilities (30 cm2Vs) and high 
extinction coefficients (3106 cm1).57 They are chemically versatile, compatible with silicon 
technology, relatively cheap, and can be used as monolayers, multilayers or combined with other 
2D materials in heterostructures. These properties are ideal for their application in photodetectors 
with high speed and large detectivity at the same time. However, as detailed by Sorger et al.8 an 
independent optimization of speed and detectivity (or responsivity) is not possible, since the long 
carrier lifetimes needed for high responsivities are detrimental for the response time. Similarly, 
large mobilities are required for fast photodetection with sufficiently large band gaps to prevent 
high dark currents and, thus, low detectivities as e.g.
