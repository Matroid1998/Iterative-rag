Description:
Compounds formed when CO2 is captured by alkaline sorbents and can be thermally decomposed into pure CO2 gas.

Text:
Carbondioxide (CO2) emissions account for 76 of total greenhousegas emissions and are 
currently 50 higher than preindustrial levels. As a result, temperatures are expected to rise at 
least 2C unless CO2 is captured and removed from the atmosphere.13 Traditional directair
capture technologies (DAC),4 use alkaline aqueous sorbents (e.g., KOH(aq)) to capture ambient CO2 
as mixtures of (bi)carbonates, which are thermallydecomposed into a pure CO2 gas stream for 
permanent removal (Figure 1a).
