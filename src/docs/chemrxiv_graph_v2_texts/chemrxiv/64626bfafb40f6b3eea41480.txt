Description:
An amino acid that can coordinate with metals.

Alternatively, metalcatalyzed ringclosing macrocyclization 
reactions are used towards heterobiaryl construction.4,5 Metalcatalyzed heterobiaryl formation has 
been utilized in many synthetic routes; however, it is typically limited to peptide sequences that do 
not contain metalcoordinating amino acids (cysteine, methionine, histidine) and relies on the use 
of prefunctionalized boron or tincontaining starting materials, many of which are sensitive to both 
strongly basic and strongly acidic conditions. Yet another limitation is that biarylbearing 
compounds assembled using metalcatalyzed crosscoupling reactions can be contaminated with 
trace amounts of transitionmetal impurities, making them insufficiently pure to meet stringent 
drug safety standards.6 Currently, no method exists that allows for the assembly of heterobiaryl 
scaffolds during peptide macrocyclization without the reliance on transitionmetal catalysis.
