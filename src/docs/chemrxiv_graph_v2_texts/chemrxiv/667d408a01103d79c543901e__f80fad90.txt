Description:
Forms clathrates with phenol derivatives.

Text:
Phenol and several parasubstituted phenol derivatives are
known to readily form clathrates with various gases at low
temperatures, and because of their selective afnities for dif
ferent guests, they can be used for gas separation (15). Phe
nols with substitutions at the ortho and metapositions are
less prone to forming clathrates, but o and muorophenol
xenon clathrates have been described (1618). Clathrates with a host framework of water molecules, com
monly called clathrate hydrates, have been intensively stud
ied because of the problems they cause during offshore
petroleum and natural gas extraction (19). The goal has
then often been to avoid the formation of a water methane
clathrate.
