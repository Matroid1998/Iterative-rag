Description:
A reagent used in the one-pot double allylation of 1,3-diketones.

Finally, in order to 
be a useful tool for organic chemists, the reaction needs to 
depend on simple precursors and be carried out in a onepot 
process.6 
Most previous examples of double allylic substitution elude 
the question of chemoselectivity by employing a dual 
nucleophile.4 For example, in 2012 Clavier and coworkers 
reported the onepot double allylation of 1,3diketones using an 
allylic dicarbonate,4a an elegant example from readily available 
substrates (Scheme 1B). On the other hand, in order to introduce 
two different nucleophiles in each of the substitution, one has to 
tune the substrate in order to have two different leaving groups 
which can be substituted sequentially, as reported by Dieter et al.
