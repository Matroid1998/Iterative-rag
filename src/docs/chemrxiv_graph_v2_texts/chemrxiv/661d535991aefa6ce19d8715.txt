Attached to proteins to impart changes in structure or function.

Text:
Glycosylation is a co or 
posttranslational modification (PTM) in which oligosaccharides are attached to proteins to impart changes 
in structure or function.1 Oglycosylation of threonine, serine and less commonly tyrosine residues is one 
common type of glycosylation, and it may stabilize protein structures,24 mediate cellcell interactions,3,5 or 
modulate activation or inhibition of biological processes.68 Some Oglycoproteins, such as mucin proteins, 
contain highly glycosylated regions predominantly populated by serine and threonine residues, with many 
being capable of hosting glycans.9 The microheterogeneity of each glycosite coupled with the 
macroheterogeneity of the differing occupation of various glycosites further increases the complexity of O
glycoproteins,3 creating a multilevel analytical problem for which tandem mass spectrometry has evolved 
as one of the premier solutions.
