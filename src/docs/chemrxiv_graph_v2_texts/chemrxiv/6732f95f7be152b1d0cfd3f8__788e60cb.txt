Artificial photosynthesis has emerged as an 
important strategy to utilize sustainable energy in 
the form of solar energy as a clean energy source. 1
7 The end products of artificial photosynthesis6 are 
known as solar fuels8 (hydrogen,911 hydrogen 
peroxide,11, 12 methanol,2 HCOOH,13 methane,14 
ammonia15 etc.) which can be produced in a 
cleaner way through water splitting,16, 17 CO2 
reduction18, 
19 and N2 reduction.20 Although 
hydrogen is considered as possible alternative to 
carbonbased fuels,6 recently H2O2 has emerged as 
suitable alternative to both carbon fuel and 
hydrogen.7, 21 H2O2 is a liquid chemical and thus 
easy to transport and utilize compared to hydrogen 
which requires energyintensive process for its 
transport and storage.

9, 22 23 H2O2 has garnered 
increasing attention as an emerging liquid solar fuel 
due to its convenient storage and transportation.10 
The straightforward production of H2O2 from H2O 
and O2 through a photocatalytic process under 
ambient conditions is gaining attention, as these 
processes are easy to handle and require minimal 
use of additional chemicals.11, 24 
Upon excitation of the catalyst by light, the holes in 
the valence band (VB, h) oxidize water (equation 
1), while the electrons in the conduction band (CB, 
e) facilitate the twoelectron reduction of O2 
(equation 2). These processes collectively produce 
H2O2, which is associated with a positive free 
energy change (equation 3).25 26, 27 
In recent years, many photocatalytic systems have 
been created to convert water into H2O2.
