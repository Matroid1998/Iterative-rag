Description:
A cathode material used in rechargeable batteries.

Electrochemical energy storage has become an increas
ingly vital component of modern society ever present in
both portable electronics and transportation, as well as
becoming important in the realisation of a fully renew
able energy grid. The dominating type ofrechargeable
battery rely on Liions which intercalating into an anode
upon charging, typically graphitic1, migrate back to a
cathode ( for example LiCoO22, LiFePO43,4 (LFP), or
LiNixMnyCo1xyO2 (NMC)5) upon discharging, and a
liquidpolymer electrolyte such as LiTFSI.6 These elec
trolytes typically possess desirable conductivities7 of the
order of 102 S cm1. However, they present signicant
safety risks due to their ammable nature.
