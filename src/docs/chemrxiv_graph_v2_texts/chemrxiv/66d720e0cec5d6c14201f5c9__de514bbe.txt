A group involved in transmetallation with alkylorganometallic reagents.

of an alkyl 
group through transmetallation with alkylorganometallic reagents8h,9b further complicates the situation with H elimination because it in
troduces extra HC(sp3) to metallacycles (4) already bearing multiple Hs.15 Since C(sp3)C(sp3) reductive elimination that establishes 
the second CC bond is typically turnoverlimiting for this class of reactions,9b,11b,13c the incycle resting state metallacycle (dialkyl H
C(sp3)2M species), and other prereductive elimination intermediates relish protracted residence time further favoring H elimination. Therefore, a key to the success of using weakly coordinating native functional groups such as amines is to promote the C(sp3)C(sp3) reduc
tive elimination.
