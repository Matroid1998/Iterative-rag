Description:
Explored in computational work for their triangular structure.

While the paradigm of triangular carbon nitrides and boron 
carbon nitrides has extensively been explored in recent computational work,1, 2, 16, 19, 20, 24 we ask in 
the present computational study whether other white spots may exist in chemical space with hitherto 
undiscovered symmetryenabled S1T1 inversion. The hexagonal symmetry (D6h) of benzene is the 
most natural symmetry for aromatic compounds. In benzene, the HOMO as well as the LUMO are 
doubly degenerate. As is well known, the HOMOLUMO transition in benzene gives rise to the six 
valence excited states three singlet states and three triplet states with the symmetries B2u, B1u, E1u 
within the D6h symmetry point group.
