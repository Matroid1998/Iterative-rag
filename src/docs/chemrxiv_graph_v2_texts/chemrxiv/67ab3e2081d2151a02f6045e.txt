Description:
Involved in the Au-catalyzed CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) as a model system.

However, the connections of key parameters 
11 
in this theoretical framework to experimentally accessible variables are elusive, thus hampering 
12 
its applications to unravel the convoluted effects of microenvironment on PCET processes. 13 
In this work, we decipher the cation effect on the Aucatalyzed CO2 reduction reaction 
14 
(CO2RR) as a model system to demonstrate that the key parameters in the MHC framework, 
15 
i.e., the equivalent standard potential, reorganization energy, and vibronic coupling, can be ex
16 
pressed as functions of two experimentally accessible variables, i.e., the surface charge density 
17 
and hydration free energy of cation. We show that the effect of different alkali metal and organic 
18 
cations on CO2RR can be rationalized by a unified mechanistic framework.
