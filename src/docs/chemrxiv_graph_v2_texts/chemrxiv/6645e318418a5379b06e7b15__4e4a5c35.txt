Description:
Produced through major technologies such as physicochemical absorption, high-pressure water scrubbing, amine scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption, membrane permeation-separation, organic solvent scrubbing, and cryogenic separation.

to biogas, detailing its composition, feedstock sources, historical 
development, and anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Subsequently, it delves into 
major biomethane production technologies, including physicochemical absorption, 
highpressure water scrubbing (HPWS), amine scrubbing (AS), pressure swing 
adsorption (PSA), membrane permeationseparation (MP), and other technologies 
including organic solvent scrubbing and cryogenic separation. The study also 
discusses general guidelines of technoeconomic assessments (TEAs) regarding 
biomethane production, outlining the methodologies, inventory analysis, 
environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), and estimated production costs. Challenges and opportunities of biogas utilization in Australia are explored, 
highlighting and referencing global projections, polarization in production 
approaches, circularity in waste management, and specific considerations for 
Australia.
