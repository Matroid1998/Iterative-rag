of a sensitiser enabled efficient stereodivergent access to the analogous Zisomer, 
via selective energy transfer, further expanding accessibility of chemical space. Scheme 1. A) Synthetic utility of organoboron compounds. B) Lightenabled in situ formation boryl radicals. C) Inspiration and 
hypothetical origin of catalystfree activation mode. D) Catalystfree generation of boryl radicals A platform for stereodivergent 
access to allylic boronic esters. Cognizant of the electrondeficient nature of the boryl radical,25 reaction optimization was explored using 
iodo BPin (2a) in the presence of styrene (3) as an electronrich SOMOphile (Table 1). In the absence of 
additives using UVlight no conversion to product was observed (Entry 1), however detection of iodine was
