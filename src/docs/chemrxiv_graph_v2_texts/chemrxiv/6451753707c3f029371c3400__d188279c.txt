Description:
Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is water-insoluble and not significantly removed by wet deposition.

Text:
This is problematic, as the fate of Hg in volcanic plumes and its environmental impact depends 
importantly on Hg speciation and inplume transformations. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) is waterinsoluble 
and thus not significantly removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition. Reactive mercury, on the other hand, 
65 
whether in the gas phase as gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) or attached to particles as particlebound mercury 
(PBM), is considerably more watersoluble than GEM, making it subject to significant wet deposition. In addition, 
reactive mercury tends to have significantly larger dry deposition velocities than GEM 4. GEM consequently has 
a relatively long atmospheric lifetime (i.e.
