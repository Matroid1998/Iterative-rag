Description:
Mobile in conventional liquid electrolytes with a low transference number, affecting battery performance.

Text:
The electrolyte liquids are volatile 
organic compounds; the solvent combustion during a failure event can lead to thermal runaway and 
explosion, and these compounds can exhibit significant reactivity with lithium metal which limits their 
use in beyondlithiumion battery designs employing lithium metal anodes.3 Also, both Li and the 
counteranion are mobile in the conventional liquid electrolytes and the lithium transference number is 
low, resulting in performance which is limited by internal impedance from anion polarization and side
reaction of the anions on the electrodes. Alternative electrolytes with lower flammability and lithium transference numbers near unity (socalled 
singleion conductors) are being researched worldwide.

Description:
Conductivity achieved in ionomers with highly dissociable bound anions in contact with poly(ethylene oxide).

Text:
Inorganic electrolytes can present fast ion 
conductivity in concert with high modulus and thermal stability.4 Nonetheless, difficulties in 
manufacturing, sensitivity to moisture, and brittleness have slowed their application.2 Alternatively, 
singleion conducting polymer electrolytes have better compatibility with electrodes and are amenable for 
lowcost industrialscale processing.1,5,6 However, dry singleion conducting polymer electrolytes 
demonstrated thus far have ionic conductivity that is too low for most applications, with the best reported 
values of Li conductivity of 1  104 Scm at 6090  achieved with ionomers containing highly 
dissociable bound anions in contact with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain segments through either 
copolymerization or blending.1,5,7 The ionic conductivity in these PEObased singleion conducting 
polymers is dependent upon the segmental relaxation rate of the polymer chains solvating Li, the ion pair 
binding energy, and the interaction of the bound anionic site with the cationsolvating PEO.
