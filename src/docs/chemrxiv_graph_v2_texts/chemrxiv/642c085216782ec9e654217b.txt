Description:
A transition metal catalyst used in borylation reactions.

Text:
As a matter of fact, these two seminal 
works have prompted the development of several other 
borylation reactions using either different transition metal 
catalysts such as Fe, Co, Pt and Ni, or other leaving groups 
such as a phosphates, ketals and fluoride.6 These methods are 
however usually limited in scope due to the syntheses of the 
allylic precursors which often require the use of strong 
nucleophiles or reducing agents, ultimately restricting the 
functional group tolerance. The development of a borylation 
reaction involving allylic nitroalkanes appeared to us as a 
promising alternative as it would circumvent all these issues 
and provide a direct access to highly functionalized 
allylboranes.
