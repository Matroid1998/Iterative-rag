Description:
An anion that defies the octet rule and is an example of a hypervalent species with three-center four-electron bonds.

Polyiodides have long1,2 been a classic among scientifically challenging systems for chemists 
and physicists alike. Structural chemistry and geometrical possibilities displayed by 
polyiodides are particularly rich.3,4 To such a richness subtends complexity even the simplest 
of polyiodides, I3, was immediately recognized as an anion defying the octet rule. The apparent 
violation of octet rule has led to a mainstream explanation of polyiodides as hypervalent species 
and has played a pivotal role in the understanding of, andor constitutes a prime example of, 
threecenterfourelectron (3c4e) bonds.57 

On the other hand, polyiodides with a larger number of atoms in the chain than I3 also possess 
interesting alternation in terms of bond lengths, with many II bonds(?) contacts(?) interactions(?
