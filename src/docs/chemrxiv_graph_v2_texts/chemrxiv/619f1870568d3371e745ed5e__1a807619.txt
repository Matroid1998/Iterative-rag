Description:
Part of the eutectic indium gallium (EGaIn) used in liquid junction techniques.

Text:
Function 
and special transport behaviors have been observed like, 
rectification14, Coulomb blockade and Kondo effect15, 16 
through utilization of experimental techniques such as 
scanning 
tunneling 
microscope 
(STM), 
mechanical 
controllable break junctions (MCBJ)17, conducting probe 
atomic force microscope (CPAFM)18 and liquid junction 
techniques like eutectic indium gallium (EGaIn) or mercury 
drop junctions19, 20. Theoretical analysis based on SLM 
depends 
on 
the 
mathematical 
modeling 
of 
the 
experimental IV plot where coupling strength () and 
energy offset (0) can be obtained and cross compared to 
spectroscopy measurement like ultraviolet photoelectron 
spectroscopy (UPS) or ab initio calculation21 The current
voltage (IV) relation in single level model is described by 
Landauer formula (Eq 1) with single level transmission 
function9, 11
