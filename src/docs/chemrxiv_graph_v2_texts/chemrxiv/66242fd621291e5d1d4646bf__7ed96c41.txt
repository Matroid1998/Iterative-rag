Description:
Compounds used in photocatalytic cyclization with nitriles to synthesize pyridine rings.

Recent discoveries and upsurge of research in the photo and elec
trochemistry domain offer an alternative to classical metalmediated 
reaction conditions to construct pyridine rings. Wang, Meng, and 
coworkers reported a photocatalytic 222 cyclization of 
aromatic alkynes with nitriles for the synthesis of 2,3,6
trisubstituted pyridines using a pyrylium salt as the photoredox 
catalyst (Figure 1C)25 that was able to overcome the high oxidation 
potentials of alkynes being the major challenge in this type of 
transformation. Electrochemistry has the advantage of employing 
electrons as traceless redox reagents for activating common and inert 
organic molecules, particularly alkynes,26 for generating highly reac
tive intermediates.
