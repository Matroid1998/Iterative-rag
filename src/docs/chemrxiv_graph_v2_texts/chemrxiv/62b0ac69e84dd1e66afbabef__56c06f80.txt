Description:
A component of a functionalized UiO66 MOF for turn-on fluorescence sensing of superoxide in water and efficient catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation.

Text:
4tButyl ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported as a component 
of a functionalized UiO66 MOF for turnon fluorescence sensing of superoxide in 
water and as efficient catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation 1; in studies of catalytic 
activity of mesoporous molecular sieve RbAlKIT1 in organic reactions 2; in metallic 
samarium promoted reductive dimerization cyclization of gemdiactivated alkenes, 
reductive debromination of vicdibromides, and reduction of sodium alkyl thiosulfates in 
aqueous media 3.
