Silica (quartz) is one of the most commonly used substrates for a variety of applications. The prop
erties such as optical transparency, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, mechanical rigidity, and
electrical insulation make it suitable for various applications 1 such as optical devices, microelec
tromechanical (MEMS) systemsdevices 2,3, microfluidic platforms 4, and solar cells. Typically,
silica has high transmittance in the visible region with low reflectance, which can be modulated by
surface texturing and exploited in optical devices. Surface texturing improves the scattering and
reduces the reflection of the incident light. 5 Wet chemical etching of silica films is extensively
used in integrated circuit (IC) technology for device dielectric isolation.
