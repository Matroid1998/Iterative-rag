Description:
A recognized neurotoxin that can be targeted by mimosine-containing peptides for decorporation.

Text:
Mimosine, or bN(3hydroxy4oxypyridyl)aaminopropionic acid, is a nonproteinogenic amino
acid found in the members of Mimosoideae clade.1 It has been found to be a reversible inhibitor
of DNA replication because of its ability to strongly bind to metals in the active site of many
enzymes.2 Based on this activity, mimosine has been reported to have antimicrobial, antifungal3
and antiviral properties.4 Moreover, it has also found its way on therapeutic applications, showing
anticancer activity5 and antiinammatory properties.6
One of us recently proposed mimosine containing peptides as decorporation agents of Al(III),
a recognized neurotoxin.7 This proposal is based on the structural similarity of mimosine to de
feriprone (DFP), a drug used for Fe(II) removal that has also shown promising results on treating
the accumulation of highvalent metal cations,8 such as Al(III) and Fe(III).

Description:
A metal ion for which novel polypeptides are being developed to strongly bind to all six vacancies as decorporation agent candidates.

Text:
The proposed com
pounds had similar structures to that of deferoxamine (DFO), another drug used for Fe(II) decor
poration (see Figure 1). DFO is able to bind to all six vacancies of the Fe(II) making it a very strong
ligand. Studies have shown that DFO is a more effective decorporation agent than DFP. However,
it suffers from other issues, such as being poorly absorbed and some secondary effects.9 Thus, the
development of novel polypeptides able to strongly bind to all six vacancies of Al(III) can be a
highly promising approach to creating decorporation agent candidates.10 However, the effects of
this nonprotein aminoacid in the context of a polypeptide chain have not been explored.
