Description:
Involved in the reversible conversion with HCO3 using a water molecule catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase.

Text:
Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an essential enzyme for carbonbased life and is ubiquitous in all 
biological kingdoms. This superfamily of enzymes is known to catalyze the reversible 
conversion of CO2 and HCO3 using a water molecule (CO2  H2O  HCO3  H).14 
Although carbonic anhydrase catalyzes a simpler reaction, it is crucial for several biologically 
relevant processes, e.g., respiration, photosynthesis, pH control, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, 
and many more.2,56 Furthermore, CA is proposed as a key enzyme for CO2 fixation, making 
its chemistry fundamental importance to green catalysis.7
