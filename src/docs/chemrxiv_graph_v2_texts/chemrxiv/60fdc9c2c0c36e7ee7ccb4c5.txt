Description:
Effectively solubilize biological membranes into nanodiscs, allowing for simpler protein isolation without the use of detergents.

An interesting approach from synthetic biology is the produc
tion of complex synthetic organisms that perform useful func
tions13. The use of articial molecules to mimic or to interfere
with cellular properties and behaviours has helped to understand
the working mechanisms of a cell14. In particular, styrenemaleic
acid copolymers (SMACs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
effectively solubilize biological membranes into nanodiscs, allow
ing for simpler protein isolation directly from their native envi
ronment without the use of detergents15,16. Therefore, they have
become an interesting tool for the study and characterization of
membrane proteins1719 with already promising results2023. Inspired by the natural proteinmediated processes known for
fusion pore stabilization7,8,10,24,25, we describe here an articial
alternative.
