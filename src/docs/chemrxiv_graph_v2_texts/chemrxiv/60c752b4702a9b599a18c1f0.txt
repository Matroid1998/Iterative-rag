Description:
Used in the formation of acyclic diaminocarbenes via metaltemplated addition of protic nitrogen nucleophiles.

Text:
Acyclic diaminocarbenes (ADCs), also known 
as nitrogen acyclic carbenes (NACs), represent a relatively un
derdeveloped ligand platform that could be useful in this re
gard.11 Although ADCs can be synthesized and metalated by 
several routes,11b their formation via metaltemplated addition 
of protic nitrogen nucleophiles to isocyanides has special ad
vantages for catalyst tuning and optimization, as both the amine
