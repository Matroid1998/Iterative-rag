Description:
A moiety that is part of the eastern fragment and challenging to synthesize.

Text:
of a nonepimerizable surrogate 
for the primary amide. For construction of the bbranched tyrosine 
moiety of the eastern fragment 4, a broad range of strategies were 
evaluated (Figure 2, strategies BD). Linkages of this type are 
extremely rare and notoriously difficult to obtain synthetically. Indeed, no successful strategy has been uncovered to date.1920 
Attempted nucleophilic substitution reactions under either neutral, 
anionic or halogenideAgfacilitated conditions led consistently to 
either formation of the corresponding unsaturated dehydroamino 
acid or decomposition of the substrates (Figure 2b, strategy B, see 
SI). Attempts to utilize addition of the histidine imidazole to an acyl 
aziridine moiety were hampered by the electronic nature of the 
acyclic twisted amide such obtained (Figure 2b, strategy C).

Description:
Can eliminate imidazole to form paraquinone methide.

Text:
For instance, cleavage of Ntosyl is 
incompatible with use of an aryl bromide,2223 preliminary 
experiments indicated difficulties in controlling the reactivity for N
nosyl,24 and rearrangement is a known issue for carbamatebased 
protecting groups.2526 For these reasons, a more efficient approach 
was developed based on direct addition into freeNH aziridines. The 
bbranched motif of 4 could thus be traced back to addition of 
histidine into chiral aziridine 9 to forge the NC39 bond of 2. To 
mitigate the risk of imidazole eliminating from tyrosine to form the 
corresponding paraquinone methide (QM) (Figure 1, highlighted 
in red), bromide was chosen as a stable surrogate for hydroxyl group 
of the natural tyrosine with the intention to introduce the requisite 
phenol moiety at a late stage.
