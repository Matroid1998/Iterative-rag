A main driver of climate change generated from transportation, manufacturing, and energy systems.

Text:
Carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from transportation, manufacturing, and energy systems is a main
driver of climate change and associated consequences (e.g., extreme weather) 19. According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2022, CO2 emissions reached a new record of 36.8 Gt, repre
senting an annual growth of 0.9 compared to 2021 20.The continuous escalation of CO2 emissions
underscores the urgent need for efcient technologies aimed at mitigating, and potentially reversing,
the adverse effects of human activity on the environment. In this context, Carbon Capture and Stor
age (CCS) technologies stand out as pivotal technologies 12, 15. Chemical solvent scrubbing, an important CCS technology, has undergone extensive investiga
tion 24.
