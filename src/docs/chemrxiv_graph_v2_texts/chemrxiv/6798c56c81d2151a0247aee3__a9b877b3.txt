Description:
Ligand classes with considerable prospects in asymmetric synthesis.

Text:
To our delight, despite 
considerable prospects in asymmetric synthesis, these clas
ses of oxazolines are still in a rudimentary stage of evolution 
and the reactivity and modularity of these ligand classes 
have never been systematically
