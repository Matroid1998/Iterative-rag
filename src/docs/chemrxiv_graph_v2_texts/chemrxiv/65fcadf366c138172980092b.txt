Description:
Substances that exhibit excellent heat resistance, chemical resistance, and insulating properties.

Text:
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibit excellent heat resistance, chemical resistance, insulating properties, 
and interfacial characteristics, rendering them indispensable in various industrial fields. However, the extremely 
strong carbonfluorine (CF) bond in these compounds leads to various environmentrelated challenges. For 
example, PFASs typically exhibit notable environmental persistence, and certain PFASs such as perfluorooctane
