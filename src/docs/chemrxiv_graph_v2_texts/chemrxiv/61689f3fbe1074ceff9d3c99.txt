Description:
Element forming the backbone of polystannanes.

Text:
Polystannanes are main group polymers with a conjugated backbone of tin atoms prepared from the reductive coupling 
of dihalido or dihydrido diorganostannane monomers.1,2 Sodium (Wurtz)35 or electrochemical coupling6,7 of X2SnRR 
leads directly to the desired materials, while conversion of such materials to diorganostannanes, H2SnRR followed by 
transition metal catalyzed dehydropolymerization810 affords the target polystannanes. Key to both approaches is 
access to both homo and heterodiorganostannanes.

Description:
A tetracoordinated element involved in the redistribution of organo and halogen substituents.

Text:
This is traditionally achieved by the Kocheshkov reaction, a 
solventless redistribution of organo and halogen substituents at tetracoordinated tin centers to afford the required 
organohalo (R4nSnCln) tin species.1 Experimentally, alkyl substituents have been more difficult to selectively 
interchange than aryl ones (nBu  Me  Ph  Mes).1 Interestingly, an increase of coordination number at tin from four 
to six has a notable impact on these redistribution reactions.
