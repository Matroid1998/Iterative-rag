Description:
A catalyst involved in the mechanism of water splitting.

Text:
However, on examining
the mechanism of reaction 1 using TiO2 and different metal oxide catalysts, water splitting
is preceded by hydration of the catalyst and hydrolysis of water in exothermic reactions that
further lower the enthalpies of reactants thereby increasing the enthalpy for water splitting
even more than what is needed for the direct dissociation of two molecules of water to form
two molecules of hydrogen and one of oxygen according to the equation 1 in which hydration
and hydrolysis are intermediate steps. It is important to study the precursors to water
splitting as already done by Fang et al for (TiO2)n1 to 4 and other metal oxides to get a
clearer picture of the steps preceding water splitting in the gas phase, using metal oxide
catalysts.
