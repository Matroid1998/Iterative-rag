Description:
Its content in MnxFe3xO4 affects magnetic properties such as anisotropy and saturation magnetization.

Text:
Manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MnxFe3xO4 MNPs) have attracted considerable attention for their 
potential applications in magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI)1. The substitution of Fe2 by Mn2 in the spinel structure can significantly alter their magnetic 
anisotropy, saturation magnetization (Ms), heating, and contrast efficiency due to the changes in their 
structural properties, including crystal structure, crystallite size, and lattice parameter2,3,4. While the 
impact of the Mn2 content on the magnetic properties has been investigated in recent years using 
many different MnxFe3xO4 MNPs,5,6,7,8 a direct correlation between the Mn2 content and the magnetic 
properties is not yet clear.

Description:
Content that influences lattice parameters and crystallite size in MnxFe3xO4 nanoparticles.

Text:
For instance, a broad range of MnxFe3xO4 MNPs (0  x 1) prepared by the coprecipitation method 
showed a monotone increase of lattice parameters and heating capacity as the Mn2 content increased, 
although these results could not be exclusively attributed to the Mn2 content due to the size dispersion 
between samples9. Conversely, other authors did not find a correlation between Mn2 content and their 
magnetic properties7,10,11 or reported that the net Ms values did not follow an increasing tendency as 
Mn2 content increased5, even when a correlation between crystallite size and Mn2 content was 
observed.
