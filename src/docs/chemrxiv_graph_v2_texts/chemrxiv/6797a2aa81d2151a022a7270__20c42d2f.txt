Description:
Oxidized to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in photocatalytic syntheses.

Text:
While the majority of industrial applications focuses on wastewater treatment,13 the 
photocatalytic reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline using TiO2 as photocatalyst depicts a promising 
example for applications in synthesis of economically relevant substances.49 Other noteworthy 
examples for photocatalytic syntheses of highvalueadded molecules include also oxidations such as 
the oxidation of benzene to phenol or of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone.10,11Klicken

derivatives such as quinaldine can be obtained through subsequent acid catalyzed steps. Quinoline
