Description:
Adsorbed within microporous solids affected by hydrogen bonds among aqueous solvents and polar surfaces.

Text:
Decades of work have shown that HBs among aqueous solvents and polar surfaces can affect the 
adsorption of alcohols within microporous solids,814 transport of H2O through carbon nanotubes,1517 and 
the stability of reactive surface intermediates within zeolites.5,6,1821 The role of confined water in 
biocatalysis, however, is more clearly understood due to the successful characterization of water structures 
within the catalytic clefts of enzymes.2224 This insight provided opportunities to design optimal solvents 
and mutations that improve enzymatic performance.2528 Such knowledge does not yet exist for catalytic 
reactions within solventfilled pores of zeolites despite the ubiquity and industrial importance of these 
systems.29,30 In zeolite catalysts, silanol defects ((SiOH)x) and other HB donors stabilize H2O molecules 
within pores and near active sites.8,9,31,32 These H2O molecules form structures that depend on the topology 
of the zeolite and must reorganize in response to nearby catalytic events.
