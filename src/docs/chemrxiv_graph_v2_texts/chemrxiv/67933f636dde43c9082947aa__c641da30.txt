Description:
Synthesized through a Pd(II)-catalysed oxidative cyclisation.

Trost 
published an alternative cycloaddition strategy to rings A and B 
of the ginkgolides, in this instance using a 32 palladium
catalysed cycloaddition to synthesise spirocycle 6.21 Magnus 
constructed these same rings via alkylation of cyclopentadiene 
and oxidation with singlet oxygen.22 Finally, Toyota and co
workers described the synthesis of spirotricycle 8 through a 
Pd(II)catalysed oxidative cyclisation.23 None of the reported 
synthesis of truncated fragments, however, included the 
construction of the adjacent allcarbon stereocentres.
