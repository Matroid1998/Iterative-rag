Description:
Forms low-valent complexes supported by monodentate Nheterocyclic carbene ligands.

Text:
Two examples of 
work on dicobalt complexes were reported by the groups of 
Nakajima and Deng.16,17 They show that lowvalent cobalt 
complexes supported by monodentate Nheterocyclic carbene 
ligands (NHCs) can react with silanes to form dinuclear cobalt silane 
complexes. These complexes feature interesting bridging silane 
ligands which can be described as a halted oxidative addition of the 
SiH bonds (Scheme 1).
