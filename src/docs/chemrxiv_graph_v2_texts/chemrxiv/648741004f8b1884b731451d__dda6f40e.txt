Description:
Targeted for improved separations using polymer membrane technology.

Text:
Polymer membranes have been
33
successfully investigated for H2 recovery, N2 generation, but there is still a significant opportu
34
nity to improve polymer membrane technology for CO2 separations. Although hundreds of new
35
materials are synthesized each year, most of the commercial membranes used today are from
36
the 1990s, and they rely on a dozen or so common polymer structures. This is largely because
37
the two properties that are important for a membrane material  high flux (permeability) and
38
high gas purity (selectivity)  are inversely correlated. This inverse relationship between gas se
39
lectivity and permeability was first examined by Robeson in 1991 (5) and revisited in 2008 for
