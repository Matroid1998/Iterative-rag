Description:
Participates in the transfer of a thiol to an acrylate.

Text:
by the transfer of a thiol from a ketone to an acrylate 
product at 90 C7 (Scheme 1) or by the exchange of thiophenol with mercaptoethanol in a thiolketone 
or thiolmaleimide adduct at 90 C.5,8 Moreover, dynamic exchange of thiaMichael polymer networks 
is reported.7,8,9 Examples include thiolmaleimide linkers in RAFT based materials, thiolacrylate linkers 
in covalently crosslinked polyester networks or thiolvinyl sulfone linkers in polymeric network formed 
by radical polymerization.8,9,10 Those materials show reshaping and selfhealing ability at temperatures 
from 90 to 100 C. Also networks solely built up by thiolMichael reaction with cinnamonitrile 
derivative show selfhealing behaviour from 60 C onward.11 Moreover, reversible thiolyne 
crosslinking was demonstrated by the group of P. Du Prez.12 Regarding retro azaMichael reaction 
typically high temperatures ( 150 C) are required.
