Description:
A chromophore involved in the photoisomerization process.

Text:
While the computational cost for solving the time
dependent Schrdinger equation numerically exactly scales exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom, the
problem can be mitigated with suitable choices of sparse grids and associated basis sets for purely quantum techniques
or by introducing a classicallike description of the nuclei while maintaining a quantum perspective on the electronic
degrees of freedom. The purpose of the present work is to focus on some of those methods, discussing their performance, their limitations
and their advantages, by applying them to the simulation of the photoisomerization process of a retinal chromophore
model 17 including the eect of an environment of growing complexity 18.

Description:
Undergoes photoinduced 11cis to alltrans isomerization in rhodopsin.

Text:
The model Hamiltonian of the system
represents the photoinduced 11cis to alltrans isomerization of retinal in rhodopsin 17 (a simplied, and well
established, precursor of the model 19 studied in Ref. 20) using two electronic states and two eective nuclear
modes. The eect of the environment is accounted for by including secondary Ramanactive modes 18, 21 represented
by a bath of harmonic oscillators coupled to the electronic states. Our quantum molecular dynamics simulations are performed by propagating vibronic wavepackets and classicallike
trajectories. For the former, we will focus on the use of dierent ideas to dene the timeindependent grid, i.e., direct
product versus Smolyak 22, 23 grids, in order to be able to include eciently at a reasonable computational cost
the secondary modes representing the environment.
