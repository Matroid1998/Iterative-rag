The key to a sustainable future lies in developing materials that can be used to generate and store 
energy 1. A crucial aspect of this pertains to the progress of ecofriendly hydrogen fuel cells and 
the production of hydrogen fuel via water electrolysis 2, 3, 4. This necessitates the engineering of a 
proficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, the sustainability of 
HER is hindered by the high cost of the most efficient noble metal catalysts5, 6. Therefore, to design 
costeffective HER catalysts, it is imperative to focus on developing catalysts that are scalable, 
effective, and reliable. Tungsten (W) is relatively abundant in the earths crust, compared to noble metals7, 8.
