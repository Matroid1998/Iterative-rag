Description:
Used to create materials through dynamic systems.

The relationships between molecular parameters such as RECs and macroscopic mechanics is 
general to dynamic systems,9,1416 and has been used to create materials from boronic acid esters,9 
supramolecular hostguest cucurbiturils,12,15,17 and dynamic covalent imine formation.18,19 In addition to 
the utility in controlling formation kinetics ( k1), bulk stiffness ( Keq), flow ( k1, Keq), and longevity 
( k1, Keq),8 dynamic binding has important implications in celladhesive ligand interactions and 
biomolecule presentation for biomedical applications.20,21 The fields of tissue engineering7,22,23 and 
mechanobiology21,24 have also incorporated dynamic chemistry into soft (bio)materials to overcome the 
oftenconflicting25,26 mechanical properties required for hydrogel processing and targeting a 
biomechanical niche.
