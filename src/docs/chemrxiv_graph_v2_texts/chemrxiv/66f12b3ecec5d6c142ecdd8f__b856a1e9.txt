Description:
Organic compounds used as set retarders to delay the setting of concrete.

Modern concrete relies on chemical admixtures to adjust performance objectives for properties such
2
as slump flow and setting time. Set retarders, for example, are an admixture class specifically designed
3
to delay the setting of concrete. Commonly employed set retarders are organic phosphonates, sugars
4
(such as sucrose), and hydroxycarboxylic acids like citric, tartaric or gluconic acid 1, 2, 3, 4. Despite
5
their widespread use, the detailed mechanism by which set retarders influence the hydration kinetics of
6
cement remains unresolved in all details 2, 4, 5. Cement hydration is a coupled process of clinker phase
7
dissolution on one side and nucleation and crystal growth of hydrate phases such as calcium silicate
8
hydrate (CSH), portlandite (CH), and ettringite on the other.
