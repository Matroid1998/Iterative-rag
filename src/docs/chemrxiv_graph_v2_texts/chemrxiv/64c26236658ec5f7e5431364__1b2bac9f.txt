Description:
A chiral ligand used in the preparation of chiral perovskites.

Text:
of a chiral ligand in lowdimensional 
MHPs. This approach, coupled with their rich structural tunability, made the preparation of 2D, 1D, 
and 0D chiral MHPs possible. Most of the chiral perovskites reported so far are based on the few available chiral ligands on the 
market such as methylbenzylammonium (MBA),  methylphenethylammonium (MPEA), 1
(naphthyl)ethylammonium (NEA), R3 aminopiperidine (3APD), 3ammonioquinuclidinium (3AQ), 
and 2 octylamine (2OA).518 In terms of structural motifs, 2D chiral perovskites are those most 
commonly reported together with 1D systems, while 3D systems have been predicted but not yet 
realized.16,19 This directly correlates to the fact that a chiral center requires organic ligands that are 
too big to be accommodated into a 3D lattice of interconnected octahedra but are easily inserted in 
layered systems.
