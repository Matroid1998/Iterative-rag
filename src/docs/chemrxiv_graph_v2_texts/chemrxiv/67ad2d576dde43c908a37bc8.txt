Description:
An energy carrier with a notable gravimetric energy density of 120 MJ kg-1, used in combustion, fuel cells, and as a chemical reductant.

Text:
Hydrogen is an energy carrier that presents distinctive
opportunities to advance a variety of technologies, due
to its notable gravimetric energy density of 120 MJ kg1
and versatile end uses in combustion, in fuel cells, as
a chemical reductant, etc.1 Currently, most hydrogen is
produced from Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), which
involves reacting natural gas with steam.2 Additionally,
other fossil fuelbased methods, such as coal gasification,
can also be employed to produce hydrogen, as the demand
for hydrogen increases.3 Hydrogen also displays consider
able potential for production through renewable energy
sources4 or via the direct mining of natural hydrogen.5
Regardless of the production method employed, hydrogen
is usually generated as a gas at relatively low pressures
ranging from 1 to 50 bar, necessitating additional com
pression for effective storage and transportation.6 While
mechanical compressors, including piston and diaphragm
types, are commonly employed, they exhibit limitations
such as high operating costs and limited reliability.

Description:
A gas that can leak from mechanical compressors and is used in metal hydride compression.

Text:
In
addition, the complex designs of most mechanical com
pressors suffer from hydrogen leakage, produce significant
noise during operation, and lead to increased maintenance
requirements.7
New technologies focused on metal hydrides for hydro
gen compression are being developed, utilizing the re
versible reaction between metal alloys and hydrogen at
various pressures. These compressors offer several advan
tages, including high discharge pressures of up to 1000
bar H2, excellent scalability, and a modular design that
allows the use of lowgrade thermal energy to enhance
energy efficiency.7 The absence of moving parts simplifies
their design, increases reliability, and reduces noise, mak
ing them an attractive option for hydrogen compression.
