Description:
Used in sodium-ion batteries due to potentially low cost and large natural abundance.

The rise of intermittent energy technologies (solar and wind) demands sustainable energy 
storage devices based on earthabundant elements, improved cycle life, and higher energy 
density with environmental benignity.1 This motivated the development of sodiumion batteries 
(SIBs) due to their potentially low cost and the large natural abundance of Na (by 23 orders 
of magnitude more than Li).2,3 In the quest for more efficient and sustainable energy storage 
technologies, organic electrode materials have come into focus as a potentially greener 
alternative to transition metal oxides (TMOs) and polyanions, such as NaxMy(XO4)n (X  S, P, 
Si, As, Mo, and W).4 As analogs to TMOs and metal cationinserting materials, ntype organic 
compounds such as quinones,5 imides,6 carboxylates,7,8 and polymeric Schiff9 bases have 
shown promising performance both in monovalent4,8,1012 and divalent13 metalion batteries.
