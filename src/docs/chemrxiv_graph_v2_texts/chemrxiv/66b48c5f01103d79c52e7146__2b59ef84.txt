of 
heteroatoms of distinct electronegativity and electronic configuration can create 
various heterocyclic aromatic nanobelts with novel physical and chemical 
properties. Here, we report the synthesis of unprecedented zigzagtype N
heterocyclic aromatic belts, beltnpyrrolenpyridines (n  6  8), from multiple 
intramolecular CarylCaryl homocoupling reactions of readily available 
azacalixn(3,5dibromopyridine)s. These compounds adopt globally 
conjugated belt structures and displayed unique photophysical and 
electrochemical 
properties. The 
spherical 
frustum 
cavity 
of 
belt8pyrrole8pyridine was used as the outstanding host to form a very stable 
21 encapsulation complex with buckminsterfullerene. This work opens a new 
avenue to the rational design and efficient synthesis of aromatic belts of distinct 
topological structures and tailormade properties which are invaluable in 
applications in materials and supramolecular chemistry.
