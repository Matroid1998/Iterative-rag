Description:
Used in reactions with B2pin2, MeOH, and THF.

One 
way to avoid this issue is by complexing the crude Josiphos to 
copper bromide, which results in an air and moisturetolerant 
complex.9 The complexed Josiphos can then be purified via flash 
chromatography or recrystallization methods without concern of 
oxidation. The pure (Josiphos)CuBr can be decomplexed using 
ethylenediamine.9
