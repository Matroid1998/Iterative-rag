Description:
A mixture important for environmental conservation in precombustion processes.

Polymer membranes are a flexible, processable, and inexpensive platform to provide a myriad 
of separations that fill critical roles in climate change mitigation (carbon capture) and resiliency 
(water treatment). For gas separations, polymer membranes have been widely used in the 
separation of mixtures in many industrial processes, including oxygen enrichment1, biogas 
purification2, and postcombustion carbon capture3. In particular, carbon capture processes are 
garnering increased attention to reduce emissions to the environment, and membrane technologies 
offer known advantages such as high energy efficiency and operational simplicity due to flexibility 
and scalability46. In post combustion, precombustion, and oxycombustion, CO2N2, CO2H2, and 
O2N2 separations are respectively important for environmental conservation.
