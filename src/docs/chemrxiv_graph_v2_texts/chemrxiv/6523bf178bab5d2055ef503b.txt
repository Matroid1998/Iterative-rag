Description:
Isomeric nanostructures formed by fused biphenylene units.

Text:
In this context, in addition to the 
fascinating linear, angular and helical Nphenylenes,6 
profusely studied by Vollhardt and coworkers7 among 
others, recent interest has aroused on the study of other 
polycyclic systems, including linear phenylene
containing oligoacenes8,9 and heteroacenes,10 deri
vatives with nonlinear polycyclic aromatic moieties11 
or isomeric graphene nanostructures formed by fused 
biphenylene units.12 Biphenylenecontaining PCHs 
have been recently explored for singlemolecule 
junctions,13 
or 
as 
potential 
singlet 
fission 
chromophores,14 while the effect of the cyclobutadiene 
rings on Baird aromaticity and its influence in the 
triplet state energies of the resulting extended 
derivatives15 have also been studied.
