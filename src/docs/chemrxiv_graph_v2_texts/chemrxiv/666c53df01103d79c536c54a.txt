Description:
Organic compounds characterized by the presence of a nitrogen atom with a lone pair.

First, we selected a series of amines with single point 
atomic variations to explore how molecular variation affects the reactivity of amines for dynamic imine 
formation. Then, we assessed the theoretical magnitude of differences in electronic behavior and 
reactivity trends through simplified Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for this series. Next, 
we quantified the k1, k1 and Keq of our amines when reacting with different aldehydes to compare 
theoretical and experimental trends in reactivity. By using a model small molecule aldehyde, an
