Description:
A photoanode material used in unassisted CO2 reduction.

Text:
Accordingly, OPVGEPt photocathodes can operate for over 12 
days in a neutral buffer solution, attaining a benchmark 
photocurrent of 17 mA cm2 at 0 V vs. RHE and onset potential 
of 1 V vs. RHE. This high photovoltage enables PCE10EHIDTBR 
photocathodes to expand the reaction scope beyond water 
splitting, attaining unassisted CO2 reduction over 96 h when 
combined with BiVO4 photoanodes. These standalone PEC 
devices based on organic semiconductors, carbonaceous 
encapsulants and molecular CO2 reduction catalysts approach 
the efficiency and composition of natural leaves, establishing 
earth abundant artificial leaves as a path towards a nature 
inspired, circular fuel economy.
