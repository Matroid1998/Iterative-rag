Description:
A key element in the nitrogen cycle, present in various inorganic species in rivers.

Text:

The main inorganic nitrogen species in rivers are ammonium, nitrite and nitrate. 1

Contamination of water by anthropogenic nitrate has become a global environmental concern 
50 
and the measurement of nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate is an effective method for identifying 
51 
and differentiating between natural and anthropogenic nitrate sources and it provides 
52 
opportunities to study the nitrogen cycle. However, established methods for determining the 
53 
nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate at natural abundance levels are demanding and often 
54 
hinder rapid and reliable measurements required in water monitoring programs. A variety of 
55 
methods is used for the determination of the nitrogen isotope signature of nitrate in water
