Description:
Reacts with carbon fiber preform substrate during atmospheric entry conditions.

Text:
Ablative heat shields such as phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA) and its variants 
PICAX and PICAD are used to protect spacecraft from the extreme heat of atmospheric entry.1, 
2 Composed of a carbon fiber preform substrate and a phenolic resin impregnated as the matrix, 
PICA and its variants are being used in current NASA missions such as Mars Science 
Laboratory,1 Mars 2020,3 the planned Dragonfly Mission,2 as well as those of private 
industry such as SpaceXs Dragon capsule.1 Accurate modeling of what happens to these 
materials in various atmospheric entry conditions requires a detailed understanding of how the 
resin decomposes thermally and how the charred material and the carbon fiber preform substrate 
reacts with boundarylayer species, most importantly atomic oxygen.4 The thermal 
decomposition of the resin has been the subject of several studies by our group,5, 6 and the 
oxidation of carbon at high temperatures has received increasing attention recently,710 although 
less is known about the specific oxidation behavior of carbon fiber preform and char.
