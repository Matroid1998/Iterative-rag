Description:
Large aromatic components often showing high affinities for binding fullerenes.

Macrocycles and nanocages with aromatic walls are 
popular synthetic targets for their interesting structures and ability 
to host aromatic guests.1 Many such molecular receptors have 
been examined for use in separating,2 sensing,3 or tuning the 
electronics4 andor reactivity5 of various aromatic species. Fullerenes are one notable class of aromatic guests owing to their 
useful electronaccepting properties6 and the challenges that exist 
in purifying,2a,7 solubilizing,8 and derivatizing9 these aromatic 
carbon allotropeschallenges which might be overcome using 
the hostguest chemistry of suitable receptors. Nanocages with 
large aromatic components (e.g., porphyrins,2f,2d,4a,10 naphthalene 
or perylene diimides,8a,11 pyrenes12, anthracenes13, etc.14) often 
show particularly high affinities for binding fullerenes due to the 
large  overlap provided upon complexation. However, the 
synthesis of such hosts is typically challenging or costly, either
