Description:
Bonds with sulfur in thiols to form the thiol group (SH).

Text:
Thiols contain a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom (SH), the high electron density of
the sulfur atom makes the thiol group a potent nucleophile. As a result, thiols can undergo a
variety of reactions, including oxidation, reduction, and substitution reactions, making them
an attractive target for electrophilic compounds including the thiol switch mechanism. The
thiol switch mechanism involves the reversible modification of thiol groups in biomolecules
by electrophilic compounds. This mechanism is mediated by the formation of a covalent bond
between the electrophile and the thiol group, which leads to changes in the biomolecules
activity and function.4 Thiol switches have emerged as a promising approach for modulating
the pharmacological properties of drug candidates.
