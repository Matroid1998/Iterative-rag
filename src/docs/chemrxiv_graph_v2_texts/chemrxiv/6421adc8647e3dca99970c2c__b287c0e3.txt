Description:
An amino acid that crystallises in two polymorphs at ambient pressure.

Text:
The amino acid lcysteine (Figure 1) is known to crystallise in two polymorphs at ambient
pressure. Form I is orthorhombic (P212121)1 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit and
Form II is monoclinic (P21)2 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structures
of both forms have been studied at ambient temperatures; Form I by Xray1 and neutron
diffraction3 and Form II by Xray diffraction.2,4 An Xray diffraction study of Form I at 30 K
has also been reported.5 In all these studies lcysteine is found as a zwitterion (see Figure 1).

A low temperature study (30 K) of Form I5 showed that the thiol group is ordered with regular S
H...S bonds and a NCCS gauche (g) dihedral angle of 70.6. However, a neutron diffraction
study at room temperature3 showed disorder in the Form I lattice that can be modelled as
either involving just the thiol hydrogens or modelled using both sulfur and hydrogen atoms. The disorder arises because the hydrogen of the thiol group can form a hydrogen bond with
either another thiol group (as in the Form I 30 K crystal structure) or with an oxygen of the
carboxylate anion as shown in Figure 2.
