Description:
A ligand used in electrochemical nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Similarly, recent advances in catalytic electrochemical and photochemical methods also allowed the use of soluble organic 
bases.4,25,4661 For instance, Baran and coworkers reported an efficient electrochemical nickelcatalyzed crosscoupling of 
aliphatic alcohols using a bipyridine ligand and DBU, although this method was ineffective for aromatic alcohols.53,54 Johannes
