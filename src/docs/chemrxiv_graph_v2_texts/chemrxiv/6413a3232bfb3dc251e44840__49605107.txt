Description:
Participates in catalytic cycles as a strong photooxidant.

Text:
Recently, a number of detailed mechanistic studies have 
been reported which use a wide range of techniques to elucidate 
catalytic cycles involving cationic iridium PCs which, as strong 
photooxidants, were reported to participate in reductive 
quenching cycles1315 (Fig. 1C) or energy transfer.16 Although 
these reports are highly useful, they provide only limited insight 
into systems in which highly reducing PCs such as Ir(ppy)3 are 
used. In contrast, while oxidative quenching cycles (Fig. 1D) 
have been proposed in the literature occasionally with regards 
to NiPC dual catalytic CC, CO, CN, or CS bond forming 
systems, 
sometimes 
with 
computational 
support,1721 
experiments capable of distinguishing between oxidative 
quenching, reductive quenching, and energy transfer (see 
reviews for relevant spectroscopic and electrochemical 
methods)2224 have not been performed in the study of these 
systems.
