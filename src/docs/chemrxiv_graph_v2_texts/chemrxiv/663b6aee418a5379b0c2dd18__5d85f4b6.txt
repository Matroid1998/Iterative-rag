Description:
Bonds such as CO, CN, and CS in aromatic compounds targeted by cross-coupling methods.

Text:
Since the turn of the 21st century, the synthesis of substi
tuted aromatic compounds, pivotal in agrochemicals and 
organic materials, has been greatly simplified due to ad
vances in transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling meth
ods.13 These methods typically involve reacting haloarenes, 
a prevalent type of aryl electrophile, with nucleophiles in 
the presence of transition metal catalysts. Currently, next
generation crosscoupling methods that utilize a variety of 
electrophiles in versatile functional group cleavagetype re
actions have emerged. Notably, these methods focus on ar
omatic compounds containing carbonheteroatom bonds 
such as CO, CN, and CS, effectively replacing traditional 
haloarenes (CX).48.
