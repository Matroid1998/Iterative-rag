Description:
Used in liquid solvent-based systems for direct air capture of CO2.

Text:
Direct Air Capture (DAC) is an emerging technology for mitigating climate change by directly 
removing atmospheric CO2.1,2 The importance of DAC has increased as emission reductions alone 
may not meet climate targets.3 However, DAC is difficult due the low atmospheric CO2 
concentration (400 ppm) in the atmosphere, which requires the processing of huge amounts of 
air, and significant energy input to overcome the entropy penalty for concentrating the CO2.4 
DAC systems may be classified into solid sorbentbased and liquid solventbased types. Liquid 
solventbased systems, use solutions like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium carbonate 
(K2CO3), and aqueous amino acid solutions which are regenerated by heating.3,5 Solidsorbent 
technologies use chemisorption to achieve good selectivity and high CO2 uptake.
