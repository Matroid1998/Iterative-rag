of heteroatoms into triangulenes has been regarded as an alternative and accessible 
approach to modulate the molecular structures and optoelectronic properties of these triangulenes.10
17 Boron, as a dopant, has received exceptional attention due to its unique photophysical and redox 
properties as well as its isoelectronic relationship to carbon cation.1826 PAHs and nanographenes doped 
by boron atom along with other heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen and nitrogen) have found to show good 
charge transport performance in organic fieldeffect transistors (OFETs)2730 due to the low lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, and exceptionally high electroluminescence 
quantum yields in organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) through multiresonance thermally activated 
delayed fluorescence (MRTADF).3134 Intrigued by the properties derived from boron and triangulenes, 
doping boron atoms into triangulenes could not only enable new insight of investigating triangulenes, 
but also provide an access to new materials and new functions.11,12,14,17 Borondoped triangulenes can 
be divided into two categories centerdoped triangulenes and edgedoped triangulenes.

Description:
An atom that can bridge the edges of triangulenes.

Text:
The center
doped triangulenes by the boron atom mainly focus on the 3triangulene, in which the edges can be 
bridged by carbon atom and many other heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen.12,14 However, the 
studies on edgedoped triangulenes by the boron atom were excluded until the 4triangulenes edge
modified by nitrogenboronnitrogen (NBN) was reported recently.17 Since examples of borondoped 
triangulenes are still rare, further development of new borondoped triangulenes is highly desirable. We herein disclose a straightforward path to access a series of 4triangulenes with three oxygenboron
oxygen (OBO) units (Figure 1) involving a triple electrophilic borylation reaction. The photophysical and
