Description:
Used to generate alkyl radicals in the presence of an iron catalyst.

Text:
In the realm 
of alkene carboamidations, alkyl radicals can be generated via 
thermal processes (5080 C) from diacyl peroxide reactants in 
the presence of an iron catalyst or by activating the C(sp3)H 
bond of alkane reactants using benzoyl peroxide and radical ini
tiators (Figure 1A).2528 Building on these findings, the groups 
of Chen and Maity reported photoredoxcatalyzed carboami
dation protocols using bromo nitriles, ketones and esters as 
radical precursors (Figure 1B).29,30 Noteworthy in these reports 
are the use of costeffective starting materials along with addi
tives (KF or Zn(OAc)2) that completely suppress alkylbromin
ation byproducts resulting from atom transfer radical addition 
(ATRA).31 However, these conditions depend on electrophilic 
cyano and ketoester primary radicals, thus limiting the gen
erality of the approach.
