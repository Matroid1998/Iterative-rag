Description:
Forms a face-centered cubic lattice in the reported superconducting phase.

An especially remarkable
report was the claim of roomtemperature superconduc
tivity at nearambient pressures in Ndoped Lu hydrides
15, which subsequently stimulated a rush 1625 try
ing to clarify and reproduce the superconducting phase
whose structure is reported to have a fcc Lu lattice but
with undetermined stoichiometry and atomic positions of

H and N. However, these verification efforts, no matter
experimental or computational, have not reproduced the
claim and the original study has since been retracted. Nonetheless, the open question of how N, along with
H, is incorporated into the interstitials of the Lu FCC
lattice remains.
