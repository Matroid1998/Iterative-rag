Description:
A reactive species formed in the presence of oxygen and organochloride.

Text:
Based on the proposed reaction network, we have developed 
a kinetic model using previously developed ChemFit software.18 By numerically solving the 
system of ODEs, we simulated the yield of peroxyradical at different starting concentrations 
of oxygen and organochloride (Scheme 1). The simulation suggested that, at a fixed 
concentration of organochloride, the yield of ROS increased with decreasing concentration
