Description:
A component of microcrystalline solid solutions that can be kinetically stabilized at ambient pressure.

Text:
The kinetic stabilization of metastable rsZnO at ambient pressure can be achieved by quenching of 
microcrystalline ZnObased solid solutions with a relatively high (up to 80 mol) ZnO content 
from high pressure and high temperature. Recently, metastable rsMe1xZnxO (Me  Mg2, Ni2, 
Co2, Fe2, Mn2) solid solutions have been successfully synthesized by quenching from 4.67.7 
GPa and 14501650 K in the wide concentration range 6,7,913. It has been found that the widest 
(x  0.8) compositional range for the existence of singlephase rocksalt solid solutions is observed 
for the NiOZnO system, due to smaller radii and the energetic preference of octahedral 
coordination over tetrahedral 9. rsCo1xZnxO, rsFe1xZnxO and rsMn1xZnxO solid solutions 
can only be quenched to ambient conditions with much lower ZnO content.
