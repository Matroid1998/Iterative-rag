Description:
Characterized by H2 and CO chemisorption, with smaller nanoparticles in the presence of Mn promoter.

Text:
The metal loadings in RhMnSiO2 and RhSiO2, analyzed by inductively coupled 
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES), are similar with ca. 2.3 wt Rh. The 
RhMnSiO2 also contains 1.45 wt Mn, which corresponds to a ca. 11 molar ratio of RhMn 
(Table S1). We also carried out H2 and CO chemisorption to better characterize the surface 
state of Rh (Table S1 and Figure S14S15). The H2 and CO uptake found RhMnSiO2 are 
both higher than for RhSiO2, implying that the Rh nanoparticles are smaller in the presence 
of Mn promoter. Note that H2CO chemisorption is not effective for estimating the metal 
dispersion in case of Rh due to the multiple adsorption of hydrogen and the complicated CO 
adsorption modes. 11
