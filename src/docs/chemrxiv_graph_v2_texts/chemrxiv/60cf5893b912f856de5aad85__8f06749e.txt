Description:
A promising thermoelectric material for midtemperature applications with a high thermoelectric figure of merit.

Text:
ptype BiCuSeO is one of the most promising thermoelectric (TE)
materials for midtemperature applications,1 reaching a maxi
mum TE gure of merit (zT) of 1.5 at 823 K when codoped
with Ca and Pb.2 The high zT is, in part, due to the high ther
mopower (350 VK at room temperature)1 as well as the in
trinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ( 1 WmK) arising
from its low Youngs modulus3,4 and strong anharmonicity.5 As a
result, BiCuSeO has attracted, and continues to inspire, a myriad
of studies to further improve its TE performance.1,68
Tuning of the charge carrier (hole, electron) concentrations is
needed to optimize the p or ntype TE performance of materi
als.9 For BiCuSeO, doping efforts have almost exclusively been
limited to optimizing the hole carrier concentration because the
asgrown material is natively ptype.

Description:
A p-type material optimized through doping with group 1 and 2 elements.

Text:
Doping with group2 ele
ments (Ca, Sr, and Ba) has been successful in optimizing ptype
BiCuSeO.1013 Other efforts to optimize ptype BiCuSeO have in
cluded doping with group1 elements such as Na,1416 K,17,18
and Cs,19 converging the light and heavy hole bands through al
loying with La,20 and increasing the electrical conductivity via
isovalent Ag doping.2123 The widespread success of ptype Bi
CuSeO begs the question of whether BiCuSeO can be doped n
type and if it performs equally well as a TE material. We address
these questions in this study by computing the formation energies
of native defects and 23 dopants in BiCuSeO.

Description:
A compound with a zT that can exceed in n-type form due to low conduction band effective mass.

Text:
Yang et al.26 have shown, using Boltzmann transport theory
calculations, that the zT of ntype BiCuSeO can exceed that of p
type BiCuSeO due to the low conduction band effective mass. We
also perform an independent analysis based on a semiempirical
model for the quality factor (b), which is a measure of the opti
