Text:
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, asphyxiating gas primarily emanating from
industrial and motor vehicle exhaust, known for inducing poisoning when reaching concen
trations above 0.1 in the air.1 Beside a modest natural occurrence in Earths atmosphere
(around 80 ppb2), the vast majority of CO is a product of human activity, most of the
time originating from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
