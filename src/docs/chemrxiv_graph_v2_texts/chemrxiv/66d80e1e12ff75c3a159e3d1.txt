Description:
Acts as an environmental stressor that can affect the stability of HP lattices.

Text:
Dimensional confinement of HP lattices via surface coordination of large molecular 
spacers allows for the formation of distinctive 2D HP structures with various unit 
thicknesses of inorganic octahedra sheets (described as n), called quasi2D HPs. The 
quasi2D HPs offer more thermodynamically feasible synthesizability, enabling 
crystallization at relatively lower temperatures while not compromising the overall 
bandgap of the materials system with respect to 3D counterparts911. Furthermore, the 
molecular spacers coordinated to the quasi2D HP surface improve the stability of the 
HP lattices, as it can act as a protection layer against environmental stressors (e.g., 
oxygen and moisture)1214. A crucial challenge to fully exploit the quasi2D HPs to optoelectronic applications 
lies in the concurrent emergence of multiple quasi2D HP phases and their spatial 
distributions in the synthesized film matrices.
