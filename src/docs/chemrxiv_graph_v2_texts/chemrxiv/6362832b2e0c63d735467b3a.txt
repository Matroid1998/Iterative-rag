Description:
A tetravalent species implemented in A2BX6 materials.

. Consequently, the crystal structure is comprised of isolated octahedra and thus
an effective zerodimensional (0D) framework, with this dramatic reduction in connectivity
being a key factor in the properties of this material family.10,11,14 Research efforts in this area
initially focused on the Snbased compounds (A2SnX6),16 but have since expanded so that a
range of tetravalent species have successfully been implemented in A2BX6 materials, includ
ing Te, Pd, Zr and Pt.1720 While some of these compounds have shown promise as potential
whitelight and tunable emitters, it is the Sn and Tibased materials which have shown the
most promising results in the context of solar photovoltaic applications, and thus received
the majority of research attention.
