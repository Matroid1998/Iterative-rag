Description:
Aliphatic 13C spins exhibit a doublet with a coupling of 35 Hz.

Text:
The splitting pattern of the observed 
C signal due to the  coupling depends on the C chemical 
shift and a particular design of the inversion pulse, enabling to 
guess the C frequency range. However, to clearly identify a 
doublet for  of 35 Hz for aliphatic 13C spins, 20 Hz reso
lution or 50 ms evolution is required. Even for perdeuterated 
proteins under 60 kHz MAS or protonated proteins under 100 
kHz MAS, T2 for 13C is typically 30 ms8, thus this method is 
not generally useful for solid protein samples. Here, we propose an alternative approach that encodes the C 
chemical shifts as the signal intensity changes, instead of the 
splitting pattern, of the scalarcoupled C spins.
