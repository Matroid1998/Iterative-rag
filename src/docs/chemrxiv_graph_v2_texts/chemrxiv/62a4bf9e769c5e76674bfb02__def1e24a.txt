Description:
A lipid whose increased content correlates with metastatic potential in colon cancer cell lines.

For 
example, Rombouts et al. conducted lipidomics and a polar metabolomics profiling between different 
colorectal cancer cell lines at different cancer stages and normal colon cell lines.8 Metabolites involved in 
lipid synthesis were shown to be elevated in colon cancer cell lines. Additionally, they found a correlation 
between increased overall phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid content and metastatic potential, especially
