Description:
Undergoes conversion in catalytic processes.

In electrocatalysis, they have demonstrated 
considerable potential for application in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution 
reaction 4, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and 
nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) 1. Additionally, SACs have been employed in methane 
conversion, CO oxidation, biomass conversion, and the degradation of environmental pollutants 
9. The high catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs render them especially appealing for the 
production of clean hydrogen through water splitting, particularly in alkaline environments 10. The catalytic mechanisms operating at single metal sites remain inadequately understood 14. This lack of clarity complicates the rational design of new SACs and reliance on trialanderror 
methods prolongs the development process.
