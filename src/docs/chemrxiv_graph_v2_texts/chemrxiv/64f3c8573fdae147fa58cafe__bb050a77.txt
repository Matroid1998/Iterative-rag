In recent decades, continuously increasing energy consumption has asserted the crucial need for the 
progress and development of green and sustainable energy resources. Also, a growing passion has been 
declared for deploying portable and cordless power tools, as well as implementing ecofriendly 
transportation.15 In this era, researchable batteries, especially lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have received 
a great deal of attention, resulting from the promising capability in a wide range of devices according to 
the low atomic weight of lithium metal and so offering the most superior theoretical energy density.69 
Meanwhile, numerous efforts have been devoted to enhancing the energy storage capacity of the LIBs 
through integrating the electrode substances.10, 11 
Selecting costeffective cathode architectures with satisfying capacity has been assumed a key challenge 
in developing LIBs.
