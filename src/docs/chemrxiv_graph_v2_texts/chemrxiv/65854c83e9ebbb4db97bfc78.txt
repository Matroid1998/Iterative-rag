Description:
A metal essential for the function of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, which catalyze the oxidative degradation of polysaccharides.

Text:
Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper
dependent enzymes that catalyse the oxidative degradation of 
several polysaccharides, such as cellulose, chitin, starch, and 
pectin.1, 1219 LPMOs work by activating (otherwise inactive) CH 
bonds in the glycosidic bonds that link the monomers in the 
respective polysaccharides. This activation ultimately leads to 
oxidation and cleavage of the glycosidic bond.3, 21, 22 Several 
mechanistic pathways have been suggested for LPMOs, and we 
have summarized the most recent suggestions in Figure 1. Originally, LPMOs were discovered in bacteria and fungi.

Description:
A common active site in LPMOs coordinated by two histidine residues.

Text:
Nowadays, LPMOs are employed in industrial 
enzyme cocktails to produce biofuels and other valueadded 
products.4, 5 
To date, eight different LPMO families have been discovered, 
namely AA9AA17 (AA12 does not contain LPMOs).23 All 
members share a common active site a copper centre 
coordinated by two histidine residues in a motif termed the 
histidine brace (see Figure 2).17 Initially, LPMOs were thought 
to be strictly monooxygenases,1, 24, 25 catalysing the reaction

( Scheme 1 ) 

but it remains unclear how protons and electrons can be 
delivered to the active site after substrate binding (see 
reactions 3b, 4b and 7b in Figure 1).22, 26 Meanwhile, it has been 
suggested that LPMOs are in fact peroxygenases,22, 26, 27 working 
according to the reaction
