Description:
Mentioned as a metal involved in click chemistry.

Text:
Titanium is not presently a household name in click chemistry, in terms of catalytic effects or forming 
clickrelated coordination compounds, unlike other metals like copper, cobalt, ruthenium, palladium, 
platinum, osmium and even technetium, among several others1. The iconic click reaction, Cu(I)
catalyzed or not, is between an azide (RN3) and a triple bond unsaturation (CC or CN) in a 32 
cycloaddition, to form triazole or tetrazole derivatives. These and several other related green 
reactions carriedout under modest conditions (room temperature, often in an aqueous medium), 
producing nearly quantitative yields, gave a tremendous impetus and progress in the important areas of 
bioorthogonal cell biology, medicinal chemistry, synthetic applications, organometallic chemistry, 
photo  and polymer chemistry, to mention only a few.
