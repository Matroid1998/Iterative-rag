Description:
Used in refluxing conditions for the synthesis of phthalazine derivatives.

Text:
For instance, they can undergo a thermal rear
rangement reaction towards corresponding quinazolines in high 
yield.17 
Commonly, phthalazine derivatives can be obtained by ring
closing reactions of either odicarbonyl compounds with hydra
zine reagents,18, 19 aromatic aldazines,20 or arylhydrazines21 
maintained in liquid aluminum chloride or by refluxing in pres
ence of zinc chloride. However, these and related methods22, 23 
require mostly toxic reagents and harsh reaction conditions. Therefore, development of new environmentally friendly and 
efficient methodologies for synthesis of substituted phthala
zines is highly desirable. Recently, domino and onepot processes have attracted much 
attention, since they avoid a lengthy separation and purification 
process of intermediate products and, therefore, minimize 
chemical waste and save resources.2428
