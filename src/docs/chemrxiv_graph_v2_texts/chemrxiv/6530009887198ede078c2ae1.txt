Description:
A key strategic element essential for battery recycling.

To achieve such targets, electric 
vehicles are seen as a key enabling technology as emissions over the lifetime of an electric vehicle are much reduced compared to 
equivalent petrol and diesel vehicles.4 For sustainability, however, efficient recycling of the batteries will be essential to help 
secure supply chains for key strategic elements such as Li, Mn, Co and Ni.5 In this respect, EU legislation has proposed new 
regulations including recovery targets for key elements and mandatory minimum levels of recycled content for industrial, EV and 
automotive batteries.6 Therefore, it is imperative that strategies are designed to recover these elements efficiently, especially as 
demands increase on virgin resources.7 At present, there are two major routes for recycling of batteries.
