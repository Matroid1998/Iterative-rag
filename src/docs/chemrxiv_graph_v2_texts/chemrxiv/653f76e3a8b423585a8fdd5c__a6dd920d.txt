Description:
A metal-binding unnatural amino acid used in genetic code expansion technologies for enzyme engineering.

In vivo ligand 
incorporation offers an attractive alternative where metalbinding unnatural amino acids such 
as (2,2bipyridin5yl)alanine (BpyAla) can be selectively introduced to the protein scaffold 
directly using genetic code expansion technologies, allowing for more streamlined enzyme 
engineering 19,20. Within these different approaches to ArM design, several scaffolds have been repeatedly used 
with various attachment strategies for transformation into novel catalysts. These scaffolds 
have been described as privileged scaffolds, in a manner analogous with privileged ligands in 
homogeneous catalysis. The most prominent examples are the LmrR scaffold, which allows 
supramolecular, bioconjugation, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids 21, and Sav, which 
has been explored in dative coordination 22, alongside the more common supramolecular 
approach 17.
