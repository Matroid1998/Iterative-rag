Description:
Studied using modern multiconfigurational methods and orbital localization schemes.

To start with, the 
DFT description generally does not correspond to a pure spin state, but incorporates 
contamination from multiple states. In addition, different exchangecorrelation functionals 
provide disturbingly divergent descriptions of metalligand covalence and of spinstate 
energetics.16,17 In the face of these challenges, chemists have increasingly resorted to a so
called spectroscopically calibrated approach, i.e., a combination of several spectroscopic 
methods and DFT calculations, to come up with local oxidation states in nitrosyl 
complexes.18,19,20,21,22,23 Modern multiconfigurational methods and orbital localization schemes 
provide a neat alternative to these somewhat ad hoc approaches, as we illustrated recently in a 
study of transition metal corroles.24 Here we present a stateoftheart DMRGCASSCF
CASPT2 study of seven paradigmatic FeNO porphyrin derivatives spanning FeNO68 
electron counts (Scheme 1).
