Solution processible conducting polymers with significant academic and industrial interest.

Text:
The solution processible conducting polymers based on 3,4alkylenedioxythiophenes (poly
ProDOTs) are of significant interest, both academically and industrially. PolyProDOTs are 
used in various applications such as electrochromic devices, light harvesting materials, 
transistors, sensors etc.1 This is due to their superior electrical conductivity, high thermal and 
environmental stability, transparency, and low redox potential.2 While the costeffective 
polymerization can be performed by oxidative method,3 the highquality polymers suitable 
for electronic applications can be obtained by Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization.4 
However, the former method suffers from poor yield, chain branching, and broad molecular 
weight distribution, whereas the latter suffers from disadvantages such as expensive 
organometallic reagents, stringent reaction conditions as well as loss of unreacted starting 
materials in the case of batch failure.
