The field of localized controlled drug delivery concepts, now affects millions of patients around the 
world, since its conception in the mid1960s, wherein it was shown that a Silicone capsule with con
stant dimension had the potential to deliver a drug at a constant rate1,2. This approach to drug ad
ministration has become favorable, as it addresses some of the limitations of the conventional deliv
ery method, such as poor biodistribution, lack of selectivity, toxicity, and even sometimes poor pa
tient compliance, etc., 3 An increasing need for orthopedic implant applications has driven up pa
tientcare and end user needs. In light of this, recent considerations towards the integration of drug
eluting implant surfaces have reportedly enhanced the fixation of the implant4.
