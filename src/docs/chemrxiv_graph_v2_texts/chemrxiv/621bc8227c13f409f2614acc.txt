Description:
A first-row transition metal used in metal-organic spin-crossover complexes.

Controlling the spin state 
of discrete molecules has been demonstrated for metal
organic 
spincrossover 
complexes 
or 
photochromic 
complexes containing firstrow transition metals such as 
nickel or cobalt.915 
Successful switching of spin states in allorganic molecules 
is rare.1620 It can be realized based on several molecular 
mechanisms,20 but only two concepts that rely either on 1) 
a photoconformational trap (Figure 1, top) or on 2) a 
photochemical reaction (Figure 1, bottom) have the 
potential of achieving true magnetic bistability.
