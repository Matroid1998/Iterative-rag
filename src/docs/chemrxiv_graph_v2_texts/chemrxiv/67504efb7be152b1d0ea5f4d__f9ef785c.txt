Description:
Biobased compounds with diverse properties that can be tailored to meet specific demands.

However, the steric 
hindrance around the substituted vinyl group is an obstacle to homopolymerization.6 Even though they 
can be copolymerized with less bulky monomers, their content in the produced copolymers is still very 
low due to the same reason.13,14 Condensation polymerization is an alternative but leads to the loss of 
hydroxy groups.1517 While the direct polymerization of the biobased hydroxycinnamic acids is of limited 
efficiency, their decarboxylation gives rise to phenolic styrene derivatives 2.1820 Due to the electron
rich nature of their double bond, they can undergo polymerization via various mechanisms based on the 
functionality of the phenolic styrene derivative.2125 The diversity of the different biobased phenolic 
acids allows achieving different properties of the final product in order to meet specific demands.
