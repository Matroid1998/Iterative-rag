Description:
Obtained from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources as a key energy storage technology.

Text:
Solar (or green) hydrogen obtained from water 
electrolysis powered by electricity obtained from renewable 
energy sources is one of the two key energy storage 
technologies 1. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is 
already used to produce approximately 12 of the 55 
million tonnes H2 globally produced every at the surface of 
lowcost nickelbased cathode in electrolysis cells normally 
operated at 80 C in 30 KOH 2. Remarkably, as of late 
2023 the installed capacity of electrolytic hydrogen stood at 
860,000 tonnes for a 1.1 GW installed power 3. Scaling up, in general, is a considerable challenge. The 
anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis has 
long been identified as the key electrolysis technology 
merging the low cost of AWE with the high efficiency of 
proton exchange membrane electrolysis 4.

Description:
Can be pressurized electrochemically for easier storage and utilization.

Text:
The key 
difference between AWE and AEMbased electrolysis is that 
in the latter a nonporous polymeric membrane possessing 
intrinsic anionic conductivity is used, whereas in 
conventional AWE the porous electrode separator has no 
ionic conductivity, with conductivity being provided by 
KOH filling the pores of a separator. This allows to operate the cells at higher current densities 
due to lower ohmic resistance, as well as to pressurize 
hydrogen electrochemically, easing storage and final 
utilization, reducing the chemical risk thanks the nonporous 
nature of the polymeric membrane 4. Corresponding authors
