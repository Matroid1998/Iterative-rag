Description:
A ternary metal oxide whose polymorphs can be predicted using computational approaches.

Text:
In this study, we remap the problem of iden
tifying polymorphs of the ternary metal oxide
Bi2Sn2O7 from a search over atom positions in
real space to collective atomic displacements in
phonon space.9 This results in an ecient and
unbiased computational approach to predicting
the polymorphs of the ternary oxide Bi2Sn2O7,
which is generally applicable to other complex
systems where conventional approaches such as
random searching or genetic algorithms are not
practical.1014
