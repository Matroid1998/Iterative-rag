Description:
A bridge used in molecular electronics to compare transport properties with 1,3phenylene.

Quantum interference (QI) effects have been invoked as an important mechanism to control 
chargespin transport properties in molecular electronics.1,2 For conduction pathways connected 
by alternant hydrocarbons, subtle variations in bond connectivity can impact conditions that lead 
to constructive or destructive quantum interference (CQI and DQI, respectively).3,4 The classic 
example involves comparing transport between 1,3phenylene (13Ph) and 1,4phenylene (14Ph) 
bridges, where the conductance of the 13Ph bridge is decreased by several orders of magnitude 
due to DQI.5,6 Graphical models have been established to predict molecular bridges that yield DQI 
and CQI as they pertain to phasecoherent charge transport through frontier molecular orbitals 
(FMOs) in conjugated systems.7,8 This method involves drawing a continuous path from one 
connection point to the other, and pairing up atoms in the alternate path.
