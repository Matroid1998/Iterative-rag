Description:
Produced by the transport of Li ions through a cation exchange membrane and water oxidation.

Text:
The key mechanism in an electrodialysisdriven LiOH production 
is the transport of Li ions from a Licontaining liquor through a cation exchange membrane (CEM) to a 
LiOHreceiving solution in which water oxidation produces the OH ions necessary to increase the 
concentration of LiOH. At the same time, H are produced in the anodic compartment which combines
