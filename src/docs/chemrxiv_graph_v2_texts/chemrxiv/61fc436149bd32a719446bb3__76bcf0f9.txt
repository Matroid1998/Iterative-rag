Description:
A component in binary devices with a highest PCE of 11.7.

Text:
Huge strides have been made in the last two years due to the emergence of the Yseries
acceptors11,12, with the PCE surpassing 1813,14, much higher than the highest PCE of 11.7
for fullerene binary devices15,16. Due to their extended conjugation, they have narrower optical
band gaps, allowing the absorption of visible to NIR light17. The general conguration is A
DADA, with the fused backbone allowing for planarity which increases the crystallinity and 
orbital stacking within the device18. While fused NFAs have shown great promise, they have some
drawbacks that limit their commercial potential. To form the fused backbone structure requires
complex synthesis, often with 515 steps19,20. This difcult synthesis process increases the cost
and results in low yield.
