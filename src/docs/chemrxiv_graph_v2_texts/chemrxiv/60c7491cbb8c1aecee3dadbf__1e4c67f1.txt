Description:
Highly functionalized structures constructed using cyclic nucleophilic imines.

Text:
We have been focusing on the development of highly functionalized azacycle 
construction by the use of cyclic nucleophilic imines through the formation of 
1,ndipole as the key intermediate (Scheme 1).8 By this strategy, we have 
successfully prepared several structurally complex azacycles possessing 
privileged 
frameworks, 
such 
as 
dihydropyrroloisoquinolines, 
pyrroloisoquinolines, pyrroloquinolines, dimeric dihydrocarbolines and 
dimeric dihydropyrroloisoquinolines.8 To further simplify the synthetic 
protocol by the design of cascade reactions, we have therefore realized an iron 
chloride 
catalyzed 
synthesis 
of 
dihydropyrroloisoquinoline 
with 
dihydroisoquinoline imines and MoritaBaylisHillman (MBH) carbonates 
recently.9 Along this line, it is reasonable to conclude that the generation of 
1,5dipole could be realized by the oxidation of in situ generated allylic tertiary 
amine in the presence of iron salts and then the desired azacycles could be 
obtained through further electrocyclization.10 In this design, cyclic secondary 
amines can be used instead of nucleophilic imines to react with electrophiles to 
produce 1,5dipoles.
