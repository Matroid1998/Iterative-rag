Amino acid engineered into a sequence for maleimide coupling.

of the protein into the 
embryo and its live visualisation (Figure 4a).23 First, we injected embryos with F2 dye labelled 
actin protein and observed fluorescence at cellular margins likely to be cell junctions (Figure 
4b). To exclude the possibility that the protein localisation was not merely an artefact of being 
labelled with the compound, we chose to label and observe a protein targeted to another 
cellular location, namely the nucleus. For this, we designed a construct that contained the 
SUMO tag for ease of purification, fused to two SV40 nuclear localisation signals (NLS) and 
three cysteines were engineered into this cysteine light NLS amino acid sequence for 
maleimide coupling.24 We purified and coupled this protein with compound F2 and injected it 
into embryos.
