Description:
Typically produced via the 2e reduction of O2.

Text:
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally benign oxidant with diverse industrial 
applications, including paperbleaching, wastewater treatment and chemical manufacturing. While conventionally produced via the anthraquinone process, there is a growing push to 
generate H2O2 through electrochemical means.1 Doing so would circumvent the necessity of 
using H2 and volatile H2O2 mixtures, as well as issues with catalyst recyclability. Further, 
electrochemical H2O2 synthesis would enable a decentralization of its production, given the 
relative simplicity of the equipment necessary for this. Typically, H2O2 (or HO2 in basic 
solutions) is produced via the 2e reduction of O2, a process that is in competition with the 
thermodynamically easier 4e reduction pathway to H2O.

Description:
Synthesized using metal-organic structures in electrochemical systems.

Text:
An emerging class of materials beginning to find unique uses in electrochemical systems is 
organicinorganic hybris systems such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), covalentorganic 
frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives.5 A particular advantage that they hold is their 
molecularly welldefined catalytic sites and modular structure that could enable the extraction of 
discreet structureactivity relationships. As such, only few metalorganic structures have been 
applied for H2O2 synthesis.6 In this work, we build on these previous studies and study the 
effects of linker identity on Nibased metalorganic nanosheets (MONs). We construct MONs 
using terephthalic acid and several derivatives and characterize the resulting materials physical 
and electronic structure with an array of techniques (Fig. 1).
