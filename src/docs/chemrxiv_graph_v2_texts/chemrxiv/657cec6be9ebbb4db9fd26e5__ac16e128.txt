known as the Fuoss law15 and agrees with the predicted
scaling law for saltfree polyelectrolyte solutions.16,17
These results indicate that the conformation of PILs
is influenced by strong electrostatic interactions, sim
ilar to that for conventional polyelectrolytes (CPEs),
such as poly(sodium styrenesulfonate),1820 sodium car
boxymethyl cellulose2123 or polyacrylic acid.2426
To further study the effect of the electrostatic in
teractions on the solution viscosity of PILs,

investigated
the
ef
fect of the solvent dielectric constant on the spe
cific viscosity of a PIL, poly(1butyl3vinylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) (PC4TFSI), in the
semidilute unentangled regime.
