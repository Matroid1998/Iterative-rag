Description:
Compounds used in biological applications that can be modified to improve their properties.

Therefore, 
structural modification of heptamethine fluorophores is 
often essential to enhance their physical and chemical 
properties for reliable biological applications in physio
logical conditions. Despite the necessity of heptamethine dye modifica
tions, the limited scope of modification methods remains 
as a hurdle to even broader utilization of these fluoro
phores.
