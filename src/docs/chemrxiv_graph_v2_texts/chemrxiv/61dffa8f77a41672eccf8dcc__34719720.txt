Description:
A compound used in the formation of two C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds.

Text:
Current efforts are focused to permit the efficient 
metal catalysed assembly of the three components, alkene  R1
X  R2Y, with particular emphasis to the formation of two 
C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds across the alkene. However, this ambitious 
goal has scarcely succeed and the most remarkable examples 
are based on the use of Ni,24 Ti,5,6 Fe7 or Co8 catalysts. Since the intermolecular addition of two different C(sp3) alkyl 
groups across an alkene remains one of the most challenging 
1,2dicarbofunctionalization reactions, the use of accessible 
alkenylboronic esters as substrates represents a synthetic 
opportunity. Four strategic platforms were launched to allow 
the formation of two C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds on vinylboronic acid 
pinacol ester 1 (Scheme 1BE).
