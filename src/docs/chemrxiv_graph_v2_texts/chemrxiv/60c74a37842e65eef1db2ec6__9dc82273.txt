Description:
A nuclear spin isomer of the hydrogen molecule characterized by zero total nuclear spin of the two hydrogen atoms.

Parahydrogeninduced 
polarization (PHIP) 36,37 is a class of hyperpolarization 
techniques which deliver spin polarization to a sample by 
way of a nuclear spin isomer of the hydrogen molecule, 
namely parahydrogen, characterized by zero total nuclear 
spin of the two hydrogen atoms. Paraenriched hydrogen 
(pH2) can be generated by cooling hydrogen gas in the 
presence of a paramagnetic material 38. In PHIP, the 
singlet spin order of parahydrogen can be converted into 
enhanced (nonequilibrium) nuclear magnetization of the 
hydrogenation product if pH2 is added in a pairwise 
manner to an unsaturated precursor using a suitable 
hydrogenation catalyst 39. Spinpolarization levels of a 
few to a few tens of  can be achieved with PHIP 
depending on experimental implementation 4047.
