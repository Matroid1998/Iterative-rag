LiCO2 batteries have garnered interest as a potential source of high energy density for 
electrochemical energy storage systems (ESSs), utilizing the power of CO2.1316 However, the limited 
availability and geographically localized distribution of lithium, along with its high cost, present significant 
challenges that hinder the widespread adoption of LiCO2 batteries.17,18 Furthermore, the high reactivity of 
alkali metals, combined with their propensity for dendrite formation during cycling, gives rise to notable 
safety concerns, diminishes battery cycle life, and imposes practical limitations on their utility.1921 
Considering its high volumetric energy density, excellent safety profile, environmental friendliness, and 
costeffectiveness, the rechargeable MgCO2 battery is regarded as a promising solution for efficient energy 
storage and effective CO2 utilization..19,22 
The nonaqueous MgCO2 battery demonstrates an encouraging prospective, distinguished by its 
ability to store energy and recycle CO2.19,22,23 However, the development of MgCO2 batteries is currently 
facing significant obstacles, such as limited rate capability, reduced energy efficiency, and shortened cycle 
life.

In addition, despite the conducive factors, there is limited study on MgCO2 batteries employing 
nonaqueous electrolytes or functioning without any assistance from H2O.19 Thus far, there are only two 
published works on MgCO2 batteries that require the assistance of water to decrease the elevated voltage 
hysteresis.22,23 A nonaqueous rechargeable MgCO2 battery with a Mo2CCNT cathode reveals the role of 
catalysts in stabilizing MgC2O4 during the initial discharge stages.
