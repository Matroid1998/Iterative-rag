of a donor phosphanyl group to the boron atom 
will facilitate the sideon coordination of the boryl ligand to the 
transition metal center. First, we tested the reactivity of iPr2N(Br)BPtBu2 (a) with 
(C2H4)Pt(PPh3)2 (1) in dichloromethane (Scheme 1). The 
reaction was initiated at 50 C, after which the reaction 
mixture was gradually warmed to room temperature and 
stirred for 72 h. The reaction progress was monitored by 31P and 
11B NMR spectroscopy, with the near complete consumption of 
the starting materials upon reaction completion. Chart 1. Structures of selected transition metal complexes with boronphosphorus
