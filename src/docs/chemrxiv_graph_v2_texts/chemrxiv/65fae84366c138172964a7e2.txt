Description:
Used in clinical analysers and wearable health-monitoring devices for disease monitoring.

Text:
Driven by the continuous development of functional materials and technology, ionselective electrodes (ISEs) became routine 
means of analysis for industrial, environmental and clinical applications (e.g. Rapidpoint 400  Siemens Healthcare, Cobas c 311  
Roche Diagnostics, GEM Premier 5000  Werfen, iSTAT 1  Abbott Diagnostics). Clinical analysers and wearable healthmonitoring 
devices allow for rapid, noninvasive and easy disease monitoring and diagnostic through such parameters as Na, K, Cl, Ca2, Mg2 
and Li 1. Potentiometric sensors have been also used in environmental monitoring of anions e.g. F, PO, SO, NO3, NO2, Cl, 
CN as well as cations Cu2, NH4, Cr6, Cd2, Hg2, Pb2 2. The biggest advantages of this nondestructive technique include high 
dynamic range, ease of operation and low cost of the detectors, when compared to other sensing modalities.
