Description:
A solvent used in the coprecipitation with water.

In addition, Jaggregates were also 
observed in the selfassembly of synthetic bacteriochlorins attached 
to peptides as a type of biohybrid lightharvesting systems.2, 3, 7, 10, 13,

We have previously reported the aggregation behavior in a coil
platecoil molecule of pyrrolopyrrole cyanine (PPcy) derivative in the 
coprecipitation with a polymeric surfactant in a mixture of 
tetrahydrofuran and water. The flash precipitation of PPcy in water 
resulted in the formation of both H and Jaggregates together with 
some monomers.25 Nevertheless, the effects of chemical structures 
and molecular weights of synthetic polymers as scaffolds on J
aggregation coupling of molecular chromophores remain poorly 
understood.26 Studies to address these issues are important to 
realize 
a 
rational 
molecular 
design 
of 
synthetic 
chromophorepolymer complexes for applications such as artificial 
photosynthesis and biomedical applications.
