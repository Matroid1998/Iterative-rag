Description:
A copolymer with good charge transport properties relative to other n-type OMIECs.

Text:
Our work sets out to identify the operative oxygen reduction mechanism of OMIECs through a 
multifaceted experimental and theoretical approach. We primarily focus our efforts on p(NDIT2 
P75), a naphthalene1,4,5,8tetracarboxylicdiimidebithiophene copolymer with 75 polar side 
chains (Figure 1).23 NDIT2 copolymers are acceptordonor copolymers and are known to have 
good charge transport properties relative to other ntype OMIECs. Notably, this OMIEC is stable
