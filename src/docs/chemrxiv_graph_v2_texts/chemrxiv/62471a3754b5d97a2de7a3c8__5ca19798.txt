Description:
Reported in synthesis of substituted tetrazoles and unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

Text:
3Phenoxy ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate is reported in synthesis of substituted 
tetrazoles 1; of unsaturated carbonyl compounds via (1) lipasecatalyzed 2, 3, and (2) 
over triazinebased microporous network 4, (3) Knoevenagel condensations; of 
imidazolium chloride immobilized SBA15 as a heterogenized organocatalyst 5; and 
catalyzed by Titanium (IV) Ethoxide 6, in pharmaceutically active pyranochromene 
compounds useful as antiviral agents 7; and in N,Ndioxidelanthanum(III)catalyzed 
asymmetric cyclopropanation of 2cyano3arylacrylates with 2bromomalonates 8. 2
Cyano3(3phenoxyphenyl) ethyl ester of 2butenoic acid was involved in synthesis of 
pyruvic acid amides used as analgesics and antiinflammatants 9 as well as in synthesis of 
2(3phenoxyphenyl)propionic acid 10. 2Propenoic acid, 2cyano3phenyl, 244
(trifluoromethyl)phenoxyphenoxypropyl ester is reported in preparation of herbicidal 
composition 11.
