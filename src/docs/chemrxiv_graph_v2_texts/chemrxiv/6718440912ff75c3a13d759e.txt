Description:
Produced as a result of the decomposition of Li6PS5Cl and Li3PS4.

One loss mechanism, often classified as a true irreversibility, is cyclinginduced (electrochemical)
SE oxidation at the positive electrode interface.5, 7 During charging, the SE is susceptible to
oxidation as the voltage of NMC surpasses 2.3 V vs. LiLi.5, 8 Specifically, a simplified LPSC
reaction pathway includes
Li6PS5Cl LiCl  Li3PS4  S  2Li  2e
(1)
Li3PS4 1
2P2S5 3
2S  3Li  3e
(2)
Although not explicitly included, these decomposition reactions are typically accompanied by inter
mediate polysulfide products.911 Electrochemically, this SE oxidation is thought to be associated
with a 25 mAh g1
NMC shoulder in the voltage vs. capacity curve at the onset of firstcycle charging
(between 3.03.6V vs. LiLi).12 While evidence shows the relationship between this shoulder
and electrode area,13, 14 there is not definitive understanding whether the shoulder results from
SE oxidation or from other processes that depend on electrode area.
