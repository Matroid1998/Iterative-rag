Description:
Acts as a Lewis base catalyst in oxaMichael reactions.

Text:
Herein we wish to report the activity of tris(2,4,6trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine (TTMPP, Fig. 1) as Lewis 
base catalyst in oxaMichael reactions and compare its performance with that of the phosphazene base 
P2tBu. Moreover, we investigate the oxidation stability of TTMPP.
