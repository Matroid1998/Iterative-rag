Description:
Efficient catalyst for depolymerisation.

Text:
Recycling to 
recover PDMSbased cyclics, the shortest cycle within the 
silicone industry, remains highly desirable, and lacks very 
competitive catalyts to become viable on very large scales. In 1997, Allandrieu and Cardinaud have found that strong 
alkaline hydroxides or quaternary ammoniumbased hydroxide 
could be used as an efficient catalyst for the depolymerisation
