Description:
Used as an iron precursor in CVD processes.

The chemical 
process from precursor to thin film always involves surface reactions and often also gas phase 
reactions.2 CVD processes of elemental electropositive metals, such as Al, Fe, and Ti, typically 
requires high deposition temperatures to overcome the thermodynamical barrier associated with 
reducing them from a positive valance in the precursor molecule to a zero valent state in the 
film.3 An alternative to high thermal energy is to supply the energy partly by a plasma discharge, 
utilizing free electrons, ions, photons, radicals and excited species to enable alternative 
reactions paths.4 
We have recently presented a CVD process where we used the metallocenes ferrocene, FeCp2, 
cobaltocene, CoCp2, and nickelocene, NiCp2, as iron, cobalt, and nickel precursors, 
respectively, and utilized the free electrons in an argon (Ar) plasma as reducing agents to deposit 
iron, cobalt, and nickel films without external heating.5 We refer to the process as electron CVD 
(eCVD).

Description:
A precursor used in plasma CVD processes, with its plasma chemistry and decomposition paths being crucial for film growth.

Text:
This is 
supported by our recent QCM findings where we saw a mass increase after the plasma pulse.7 
For the eCVD process, it is a vital step to understand the plasma chemistry of FeCp2 in order 
to in the future connect the plasma chemistry to the film growth. For plasma CVD processes 
using FeCp2 as a precursor and especially those also utilizing electrons, this paper can therefore 
give insight into the plasma chemistry and plasma decomposition paths for FeCp2. FeCp2 decomposition has so far not been studied in eCVD, i.e., Ar plasma in the pressure range 
of 3050 Pa but there are a few reports using other conditions. For example, FeCp2 
decomposition have previously been studied by photolytic,8 femtosecondnanosecond laser
