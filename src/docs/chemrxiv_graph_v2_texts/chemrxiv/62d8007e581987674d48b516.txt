Description:
Possess a rigid molecular structure and are typically based on p and n-doped forms.

This is typically accomplished 
using a twisted structure containing donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments.3d However, the 
chargetransfer (CT) excited state2b, 4 and the large reorganization energy in the excited state 
lead to broad emission, characterized by large full width halfmaximum (FWHM)  80 nm.3c, 
5 The corresponding TADF OLEDs do not show the desired high color purity. A solution is to use multiresonant TADF (MRTADF) emitters.6 MRTADF emitters are 
typically based on p and ndoped nanographenes and so possess a rigid molecular structure.7 
The ingenious molecular design places each of the frontier molecular orbital (FMOs) on 
adjacent atoms thus leading to shortrange charge transfer (SRCT) between adjacent atoms,
