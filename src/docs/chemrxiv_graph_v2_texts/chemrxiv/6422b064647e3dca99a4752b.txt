Description:
An element associated with a high number of active antimicrobial compounds.

Text:
Of these 31 (61) showed activity against the two fungal pathogens 
tested by COADD, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Together with silver, palladium was the 
element with the highest number of active compounds. In addition to antimicrobial activity, COADD also 
tests active compounds for their cytotoxicity against mammalian cells as well as their haemolytic properties. Of the 31 active compounds, 12 palladium complexes did not show any toxic properties in these in vitro 
assays. Figure 1 shows three of the structures (13) with the best antifungal activity in the COADD panel.12 
These compounds showed high levels of activity across a panel of fungal pathogens with different degrees of 
drug resistance. However, upon further investigation, relatively high levels of cytotoxicity and haemolysis 
were found for compounds 13.
