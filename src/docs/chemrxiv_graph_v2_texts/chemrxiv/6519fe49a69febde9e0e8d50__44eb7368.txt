The World Health Assembly en
dorsed a resolution (WHA54.19) urging affected countries 
to control morbidity by periodically treating atrisk people, 
particularly preschool and schoolage children, pregnant 
women, and highrisk workers (teapickers, miners, farm
ers, etc.). The prevalence of helminthic infections necessi
tates the development of affordable and efficient medica
tion that can be distributed across broad geographic re
gions. These medicines are also provided as part of school
based deworming initiatives, usually given to primary 
school students once a year. Therefore, it is beneficial to 
formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredients as palata
ble drugs, such as sweet and sour chewable tablets. Thiabendazole (TBZ, Scheme 1) is a staple medicine for 
treating strongyloidiasis (threadworm), cutaneous and vis
ceral larva migrans, trichinosis, and other parasites.
