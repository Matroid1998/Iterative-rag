TMDs like CrS2 and CrSe2 show unique properties such as
valley polarization in band structure17, piezoelectric cou
pling, and phasedependent intrinsic magnetic properties18. For example, a previous report shows that CrS2 nanosheet
has the potential to use as negative electrodes in lithium
ion batteries that could be promising for highpower en
ergy storage19. Similarly, strain engineering has been

properties of Crbased TMDs are promising materials when
they are engineered in heterostructure form 10.

Description:
A 2D valleytronic crystal with large valley spin splitting in the valence band.

Plus, the
CrS2 and CrSe2 are two exceptional 2D valleytronic crystals
with large valley spin splitting in the valence band17. Recently, a new derivative of TMDs, the socalled Janus
TMD (JTMD) has drawn considerable interest due to their
unique physical and chemical properties from the conven
tional TMDs because of an outofplane structural asymme
try. A single layer JTMD, MoSSe, was successfully fabri
cated in the laboratory by fully replacing the top Se layer of
MoSe2 TMD and inserting the S layer by using the chemical
vaporization deposition (CVD) technique22. Further, sev
eral JTMDs have been studied theoretically23, 24, 25, 26,
which are mostly semiconductors with an energy bandgap
between 1.36 to 1.97 eV exhibiting strong optical absorption
at the visible region27.
