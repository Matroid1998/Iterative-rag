Description:
A highly symmetric species observed using 27Al MAS NMR techniques with relatively narrow line shapes.

Text:
Evidence for a synergistic interaction between 
the Brnsted and the Lewis acid sites has also been presented.6 

Direct characterization of the Lewis acid sites is challenging due to their extremely 
low volumetric abundance (nearsurface species) and the high spin of the 27Al nucleus 
(I  52), giving rise to a considerable quadrupolar moment which, in turn, interacts with 
the electric field gradient (EFG) to produce potentially very broad and complex line 
shapes.7 Although simple onedimensional (1D) 27Al MAS NMR techniques are routinely 
used to observe highly symmetric species (e.g., AlO4 or AlO6), which exhibit relatively 
narrow line shapes, other species of lower symmetry can result in resonances spanning
