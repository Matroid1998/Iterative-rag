Undergo photochemical cyclization reactions.

Photoresponsive functional systems have been studied 
across a broad range of research disciplines, including 
nanomachinery,1 
optical 
data 
storage,2 
photopharmacology,3 smart materials4 and solar energy 
storage.5 Such molecules can switch between thermally 
stable and metastable isomers, typically accompanied with 
changes in colour andor structure. Transformations from 
a thermally stable isomer to a metastable structure is 
typically driven by light, while the reverse process can be 
driven either photochemically or thermally. A large 
collection of photoswitchable skeletons have been 
developed, with their transformations roughly separable 
into two modes of photoisomerization process (1) 
photochemical doublebond EZisomerization reactions 
(i.e., 
stilbenes,6 
azobenzenes,7 
indigos8 
and 
iminothioindoxyls9), and (2) photochemical cyclization 
reactions 
(i.e., 
spiropyrans,10 
diarylethenes11 
and 
norbornadienes5).
