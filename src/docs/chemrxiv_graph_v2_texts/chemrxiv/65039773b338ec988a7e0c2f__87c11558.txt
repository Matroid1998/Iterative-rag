Description:
Dependent enzymes that catalyze a wide variety of reactions, including halogenation.

. The selective functionalization16 of unactivated CH bonds remains one of the greatest 
challenges in catalysis. Inspiration can be taken from nature, where selective enzymatic CH 
halogenation plays a critical role in numerous biochemical processes.7, 8 In addition to their 
incorporation in natural products911 and related biological7, 12, 13 and medicinal1416 applications, 
halogenated compounds find a wide variety of uses in therapeutic drugs1719 and agrochemicals.20
22 The enzymes that carry out CH activation are typically aketoglutarate (aKG)dependent 
enzymes that operate under ambient conditions with strong regioselectivity and stereoselectivity23 
resulting in the catalysis of a wide variety of reactions2427, including halogenation.
