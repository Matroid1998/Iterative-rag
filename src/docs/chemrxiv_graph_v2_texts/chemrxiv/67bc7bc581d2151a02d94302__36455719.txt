Description:
A high Ni variant of NMC used in batteries.

Text:
Recent efforts to 
reduce Co content in NMC batteries, due to its high cost and 
ethical concerns, have led to the development of high Ni 
variants such as NMC622 (LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O). It is estimated 
that, by 2050, the production of NMCbased LIBs from primary 
resources to fulfill the future demand will lead to the emission 
of greenhouse gases totaling 8.2 GtCO2eq.3 Thus, sustainable 
recycling of NMCbased endoflife LIBs by recovering valuable 
metals such as Li, Ni, Mn, and Co will not only reduce the burden 
on primary resources but also minimize the environmental 
impacts.
