Description:
A compound for which no trace of dimers is observed by NMR due to highly disfavored formal 5 charge.

Text:
Although 
an analogous sixmembered ester (and potentially its dimers) 
between the 3 and 5hydroxyl groups would introduce similar 
configurational changes to those ascribed to 1a, DFT 
calculations revealed that its formation is much less 
exothermic and consequently disfavored. Similarly, the 
analogous fivemembered borate ester of Rib1P is less 
favored than 1a (which is requisite for the observed 
equilibrium shift), as supported by DFT and NMR data (Figs. 1F and S10). Additionally, we observed no trace of dimers of 
Rib1P by NMR, which is likely a result of the highly disfavored 
formal 5 charge of these species.
