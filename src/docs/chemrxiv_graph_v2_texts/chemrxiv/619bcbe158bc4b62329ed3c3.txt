Description:
Forms nanotubes that display anion catalysis.

Text:
The anion catalysis 
concept8 has since been applied to a range of reactions, typically making use of electron deficient naphthalene diimides (NDIs) and 
their extended homologues9 or electron deficient heteroaromatic species,10 including enantioselective examples.11 More recently, 
examples have been reported in which the surfaces of fullerenes or carbon nanotubes display anion catalysis,12 as well examples 
in which an electron deficient  surface is engaged in  stacking interactions,13 the results of which, supported by computational 
analysis, suggest that the polarizability of the  surface, as well as its permanent quadrapole moment, plays a key role in catalyst 
activity.
