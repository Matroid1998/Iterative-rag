Description:
Has similar O2 etching behavior to silicon carbide, losing SiO and COCO2.

Text:
Depending on 
temperature and O2 pressure (PO2), etching may be active, or result in passivation by growth of a 
thin SiO2 layer.26 At higher temperatures, SiO2 surface layers on Si can decompose and desorb 
by the reaction SiO2  Si  2 SiO(g), and even thick SiO2 can decompose and desorb as SiO, O2, 
and O at temperatures above 1800 K.7 Silicon carbide (SiC) has similar O2 etching behavior, 
losing SiO and COCO2, and passivating due to SiO2 layer growth under the right conditions.

Description:
Subject to sublimation and O2 etching in nanoparticle form.

Text:
We 
previously reported a study of sublimation and O2 etching of individual Si and SiC nanoparticles 
(NPs), and interestingly, it was found that under etching conditions, the NPs eventually passivated, 
even though the temperature (TNP) and PO2 conditions examined were in the range where bulk Si 
passivation is not observed. This difference in passivation was attributed to the limited volume of 
the NPs, affecting surfacetosubsurface oxygen diffusion. Silica NPs, where the NP volume is 
initially oxygen saturated, provide a different perspective on the etching and passivation behavior 
for Sirich materials, and particularly on the role of subsurface oxygen, and that is the focus of this 
work. There is considerable interest in ultrahigh temperature ceramics (e.g.
