Description:
A component of volcanic plumes that affects acidity and atmospheric chemistry.

through localized deposition. Volcanic plume chemistry is complex, particularly because conditions within a plume can differ greatly from 
typical atmospheric conditions, for example with regards to temperature, the concentration of radicals, particle 
loading, acidity, and sulfur and halogen contents. As the initial plume cools and mixes with background air, the 
speciation of atmospheric Hg likely evolves. Indeed, while emitted Hg is mainly in the form of GEM when it exits
