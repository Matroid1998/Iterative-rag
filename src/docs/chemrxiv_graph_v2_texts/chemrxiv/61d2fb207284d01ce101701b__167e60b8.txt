Description:
A ligand that forms complexes with poor solubility in common organic solvents.

The (nowadays commercially avail
able) pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand has afforded fasci
nating new structures (Figure 1).18 For instance, the introduc
tion of a pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand caused the for
mation of a linear stannocene, whose structure is in contrast to 
those of Cp2Sn and Cp2Sn, which are significantly bent 
Cp(centroid)SnCp(centroid) angles of 33 and 25, respec

cene was accomplished.18,22 Due to poor solubility of penta
