Description:
Reacts in ionic liquids with similarities and differences to sulfur conversion.

Text:
Especially, the partially 
stable trisulfide radical anion S3 was observed which further reacts with EMImOAc.11

The reaction of poly(sulfur nitride) (SN)x1519 in the same IL has several similarities with the 
system discussed above, but also significant differences. The NMR data showed a variety of 
reaction products which were significantly more than that of S8 in EMImOAc. On the one 
hand, it could be determined that EMImS is also formed during the reaction and, on the other 
hand, further signals were found in the NMR spectra that indicated iminebased compounds on 
the imidazolium ring.20 Another interesting difference to the sulfur conversion was indicated 
by EPR spectra.
