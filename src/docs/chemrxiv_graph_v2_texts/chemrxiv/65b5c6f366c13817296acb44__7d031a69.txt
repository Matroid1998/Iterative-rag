Description:
Facilitates the formation of diacylcysteine protocells, supporting models of primordial membrane assembly.

Text:
We find that the formation of diacylcysteine protocells was facilitated by silica 
substrates, supporting previous models of primordial membrane assembly (26 . We propose a simple electrostatic 
mechanism for substratetemplated membrane formation and describe several experiments that support our hypothesis. Unlike fatty acids, and even phospholipids, the head group of the lipid can be varied dramatically by diacylation of N
terminal Cyscontaining peptides. This suggests the potential for significant structural diversity and functionality in
