Description:
An early transition metal used in the formation of MXenes.

Text:
MXenes are a large family of 2D materials, with more than 50 stoichiometric MXenes 
experimentally synthesized, hundreds of computationally predicted compositions, and an infinite 
number of solidsolution MXenes (Figure 1).1,2 The general formula of MXenes can be expressed 
as Mn1XnTx where M is an early transition metal (Ti, Nb, Ta, Mo, V, etc. ), X is carbon andor 
nitrogen, and n is an integer 1  4. Tx represents the surface termination groups (typically OH, 
O, and F)3 and will not be continually expressed for clarity.
