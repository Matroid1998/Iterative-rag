Description:
Neutralized in systems to predict conditions for ultralow interfacial tensions.

Text:
through the 
aqueous phase, it is possible to create transient ultralow IFTs. The conditions (NA and NaN 
concentration and the salinity of the system) that led to ultralow IFTs were predicted by an HLD
NAC model previously validated for the neutralization of oleic acid. Keywords Emulsions, Naphthenic Acid, neutralization, HLD, HLDNAC, interfacial tension,
