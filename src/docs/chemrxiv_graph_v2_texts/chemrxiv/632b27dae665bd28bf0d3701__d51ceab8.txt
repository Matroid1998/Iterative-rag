Description:
Incorporates high hydride ion concentrations up to y = 0.6 and demonstrates high electric and hydride ion conductivity.

The favorable electron and hydride ion
transport properties together with the low mass of hydride ions
and high electrode potential of the H2Hredox couple (2.3 V)
make these materials particularly attractive for developing energy
storage devices with high energy density.79 Since the synthesis
of the rst oxyhydride10 several tens of new structures have been
prepared and characterized.11 Among these the most extensively
investigated which exhibit some of the most interesting chemi
cophysical properties are the perovskitestructured ATiO3xHy (A
 Ca, Sr, Ba) materials.4,12,13 BaTiO3xHy has been shown to
incorporate high hydride ion concentrations up to y  0.6, more
over, and has demonstrated high electric and hydride ion conduc
tivity.4 Complete understanding of the electron and hydride ion
transport mechanisms and their relation to the oxyhydride com
position is crucial for rational design of materials with specically
tailored characteristics.

Description:
Exhibits metallic conductivity with high hydride concentrations and semiconducting behavior with lower hydride compositions.

Text:
Recently, conductivity measurements on epitaxial thin lms re
vealed that BaTiO3xHy has metallic conductivity with high hy
dride concentrations (y  0.2), while it is semiconducting with
lower hydride compositions (y  0.2).20 Liu et al. proposed that
the semiconductorlike behaviour is a result of electron polaron
formation.15 Polarons are quasiparticles composed of a localized
charge carrier within a potential energy well that is selfgenerated
by distorting the local lattice.21 In BaTiO3xHy the substitution
of oxygen with hydrogen introduces an electron in the Ti 3d
band which can potentially localize and form an electron po
laron.

Description:
An oxyhydride studied for its hydride local environment and dynamics using 2H solid-state NMR.

Text:
Thermally activated polarons can hop to neighboring Ti
ions and would display semiconductorlike conductivity in the
bulk phase.22 However, a more recent study using INS and den
sity functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the extra
electron is more likely to delocalize among all Ti 3dbands gener
ating a bandstate with metallic electrical conductivity.23 Several
investigations on the oxyhydride with solidstate nuclear mag
netic resonance (NMR) have also proposed that the electronic
structure is more likely a bandstate.2426 In contrast to other re
ports Misaki and coworkers25 suggested that the hydride site is
occupied by two hydrogens. Here we report a comprehensive study of hydride local en
vironment and dynamics by employing 2H solidstate NMR on
three distinctly prepared BaTiO3xHy oxyhydrides with different
hydride compositions.
