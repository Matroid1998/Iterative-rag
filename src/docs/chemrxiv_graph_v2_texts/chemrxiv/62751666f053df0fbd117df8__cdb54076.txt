Description:
A type of nitrogen coordination in tetracoordinated FeN4 sites labeled as FeN4C10.

Text:
In both afore
mentioned works, the deoxygenated in this case bare sites are 
tetracoordinated FeN4 sites; however the nature of the inplane 
nitrogen ligands differs Chung et al. describe a pyridinic coordina
tion, while Zitolo et al. assume a pyrrolic one.2, 27 These coordina
tion types are labeled FeN4C10 (pyridinic) and FeN4C12 (pyrrolic), 
where the subscript on C refers to the smallest number of carbon 
atoms connecting the four inplane nitrogen donor atoms.
