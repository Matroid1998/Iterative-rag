Description:
Acts as a ligand for Fe(III) to increase the rate of decarboxylation and radical formation.

Text:
conducted the ligand
accelerated decarboxylative alkylation of heteroarenes using 
iron LMCT at 456 nm.15 The rate constant of irreversible de
carboxylation and formation of nucleophilic carboncentred 
radicals could be increased by employing pyridine2carbox
ylic acid (picolinic acid) as a ligand for Fe(III) and NaBrO3 as 
oxidant. The photoreactions were carried out in a solvent mix
ture of 91 vv water and DMSO, and the alkylated products 
were obtained in moderate to good yields. However, the re
search group mentioned in the supporting information that the 
reaction fails in the absence of the additional pyridine carbox
ylic acid ligand (Scheme 1, b). The objective of the here reported project is to explore the 
feasibility of an effective ligandtometal charge transfer in 
pure water as the reaction solvent.
