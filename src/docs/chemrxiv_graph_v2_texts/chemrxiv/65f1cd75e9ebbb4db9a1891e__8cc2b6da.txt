Description:
Used as a template in the form of nanospheres for creating pores in solids.

Text:
An alternative route 
to increase surface area during synthesis is by generation of pores within the solid. This 
can be achieved through hard casting, using templates such as mesoporous silica8 or 
polymethylmethacrylate nanospheres3, or by nanostructuring of precursors, e.g., from 
macroporous Fe2O3.9
