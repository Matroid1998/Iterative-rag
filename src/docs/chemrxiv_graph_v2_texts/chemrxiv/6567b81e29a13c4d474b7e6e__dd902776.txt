Description:
Aliphatic feedstocks that are conventionally inert but can be functionalized using metallaphotoredox cross-coupling.

Text:
In the realm of organic synthesis, crosscoupling technolo
gies have profoundly streamlined the preparation of complex, 
highvalue molecules across numerous chemical industries.1,2 
Notably, the metallaphotoredox crosscoupling platform har
nesses reactive radical intermediates under mild, transition 
metalmediated bondforming conditions.3 By enabling open
shell functionalization of abundant yet conventionally inert ali
phatic feedstocks such as chlorides, carboxylic acids and CH 
nucleophiles, this powerful strategy enables practical fragment 
couplings unachievable via traditional twoelectron pathways.4
7 These transformations are particularly suited for delivering 
C(sp3)rich scaffolds, molecular cores which are increasingly 
recognized as vital components of clinically successful small 
molecule drug candidates (Figure 1).8 Novel metallaphotore
dox methods, particularly those employing new aliphatic part
ners and offering previously untenable retrosynthetic discon
nections, can ultimately provide valuable approaches to unex
plored, medicinallyrelevant chemical space.
