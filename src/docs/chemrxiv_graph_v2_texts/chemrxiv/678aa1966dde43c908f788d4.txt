Description:
An acid used in stoichiometric analysis with extractants and metal ions like Am3 and Eu3.

Text:
Recognizing the utility of stoichiometric analysis that can be performed from concentration
dependent data, this work has compiled a dataset across 35 references for four extractants
with nitric acid, and Am3 and Eu3. 2
