Description:
At least fifty times more viscous than propionic acid.

This was confirmed by atomic force microscopy9. We speculated that this force 
might cause a measurable depression in the kinematic viscosity of a racemic mixture. There is to date 
no fully quantitative theory of liquid viscosity10,11, but attractive intermolecular forces, especially 
hydrogen bonds, clearly play an important role. For example, 2hydroxypropionic acid (lactic acid) is 
at least fifty times more viscous than propionic acid. One would therefore expect viscosity to be 
steeply dependent on hydrogen bond strength. Here we report that racemic lactic acid is less viscous 
than its enantiomers. Classical molecular dynamics viscosity simulations of lactic acid enantiomers 
show no such viscosity difference, consistent with it being a quantum effect.
