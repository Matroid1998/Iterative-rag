Description:
An element abundant in NaS batteries, contributing to high energy density and cost-effectiveness.

Text:
NaS batteries, despite their relatively limited commercial deployment in recent years, have a 
substantial history in mobile energy storage, primarily due to their high energy density, 
abundance of sodium and sulfur, and potential for costeffectiveness.1 Before the rise of 
lithiumbased chemistries and sustainabilitydriven policies, NaS cells held promise across 
sectors, notably in the global automotive industry.
