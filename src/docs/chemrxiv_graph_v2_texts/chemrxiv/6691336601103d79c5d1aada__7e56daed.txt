Involved in ring opening reactions.

Nowadays, 
the Williamson ether synthesis and Mitsunobu reactions have proven to be reliable for accessing ethers, 
particularly primary dialkyl ethers.8,9 Recent decades have also seen the advancements in CH 
activation,1013 cyclopropane ring opening reactions,14,15 transitionmetal catalysis1622, and other 
methodologies.23 Despite these improvements, the synthesis of the hindered dialkyl ethers remains 
challenging because of the bulkiness of reagents and competitive side reactions such as halide elimination. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024hbsbj ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000337698097 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0

Furthermore, synthesizing the polyfluorinated ethers is inhibited by specific properties such as low 
nucleophilicity, high polarity, and acidity of polyfluorinated alcohols.24
