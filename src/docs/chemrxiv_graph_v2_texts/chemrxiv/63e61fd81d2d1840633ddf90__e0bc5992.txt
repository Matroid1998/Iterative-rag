Whisky is a popular grainbased spirit originating allegedly from Ireland in the 7th century 
34 
(Wisniewska, Dymerski, Wardencki,  Namiesnik, 2014). It has a distinctive aromatic profile that varies 
35 
by brand, dependant on the choice and quality of grains, their fermentation, choice of barrel and its 
36 
treatment, and the duration of the ageing process. The variety and concentrations of alcohols, 
37 
aldehydes, esters, fatty acids, fermentation products from yeast and other local microbes, phenolics 
38 
and lactones are subject to the variables mentioned above (Jeffery, 2012). 39 
It is a readily available commodity from most supermarkets and offlicenses, with the pricing most
40 
commonly reflecting the quality of the product, and in most cases, the age of the product.
