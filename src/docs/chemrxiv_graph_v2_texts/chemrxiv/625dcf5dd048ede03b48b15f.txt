Description:
A highly conductive active material.

Text:
Minimizing overpotentials in battery electrodes is necessary to improve performance metrics such as
rate capability or accessible capacity.1 Depending on whether or not electronic transport contributes
meaningfully to the overpotential,210 the engineering strategies for particle morphology, coating, or
conductive additives widely differ.11 In one extreme where the electrochemically active material is elec
tronically insulating, such as in LiFePO4, enabling electronic transport1215 is recognized as a critical
step in the electrode design. In highly conductive active materials such as LiCoO2 (LCO),16 optimiza
tion for electronic transport is generally not of high priority.17 Meanwhile, ternary layered oxides such
