Description:
Released as radicals from TiOH bonds, facilitating the reduction of the titanium center.

Most artificial photosynthesis (AP) systems, including those at the forefront of research, focus on
water splitting for hydrogen production or reducing CO to basic hydrocarbons (C1C3). The ability
to synthesize longchain compounds (up to C17) offers a transformative opportunity to produce
highervalue chemicals, advancing AP technology scalability. The newly developed TiCl2phenylindole (PI) photocatalytic system uses visible light to convert
atmospheric CO and HO into multicarbon oxygenated hydrocarbons1. This breakthrough
integrates Direct Air Capture (DAC) of CO2 with conversion, addressing critical challenges in
climate change, energy sustainability, and resource efficiency. The mechanism involves forming photoactive TiOH bonds through the hydrolysis of TiCl
bonds by ambient air humidity. Upon exposure to light and air, these TiOH bonds release
hydroxyl radicals, facilitating the reduction of the titanium center (Ti TiTi).

Description:
Highly reactive radicals with a redox potential of 2.8 V, second only to fluorine.

Text:
A crucial feature of this system is the photocatalytic generation of hydroxyl radicals, released from
TiOH, TiOH, and TiOH bonds. With a redox potential of 2.8 V (second only to fluorine),
hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive, yet transient species that drive the organotitanium catalytic
process. While TiO photocatalysis is known to produce hydroxyl radicals, their synergistic role in
facilitating complex reaction cascades in this system is unprecedented. Although hydroxyl radicals typically exist on the nanosecond scale, they can persist for up to 600
seconds in aqueous environments, enabling diverse redox reactions. These include dimerization to
form HO, oxidation of TiO bonds to peroxotitanium species (TiOO), oxidation of PI ligands to
NO functionalities, conversion of CO to HCOOH, and condensation or radical coupling involving
formaldehydederived intermediates.
