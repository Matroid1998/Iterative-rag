Description:
Compounds that respond efficiently to light only up to approximately 500 nm.

Reversible EZ and ZE isomerisations of azobenzenes can be ef
fected with UVvisible light1, as well as with redox reactions follow
ing photocatalysis2, electrocatalysis3, or Xray illumination4. The 
high spatiotemporal precision, noninvasiveness, and rapidity with 
which bulk populations of azobenzenes can be photoisomerised in 
both EZ and ZE directions has made azobenzene photoswitching 
a powerful tool for manipulating the physical and optical properties 
of solid materials5, the electronic and dynamic properties of soft mat
ter6, and for controlling protein functions and downstream cascades 
in biochemistry, cell biology, and in adult animals.712 
Azobenzene photoresponse and isomerisation completeness are 
critical for all these applications. Alkylazobenzenes respond effi
ciently to light only up to ca. 500 nm.
