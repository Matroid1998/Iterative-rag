Description:
A form of ITQ13 that can be synthesized with boron in its framework.

Text:
The zeolite ITQ13 was first reported by Cormas group from the Institute of Chemical Technology 
(Instituto de Tecnologa Qumica, ITQ) at the Polytechnic University of Valencia in a patent published 
in 2002.1 ITQ13 is a mediumpore zeolite with a threedimensional pore system consisting of 
channels formed by nine and tenmembered rings (9MR10MR) of TO4 tetrahedra.2 In addition to 
the allsilica form, labelled ITQ13SiO2 throughout this article, this zeolite can also be synthesised as 
borosilicate, aluminosilicate,2,3 and silicogermanate.1,4 Due to its narrow channel system and high 
acidity, ITQ13 is a very interesting material for catalytic applications. In the cracking of vacuum gasoil,
