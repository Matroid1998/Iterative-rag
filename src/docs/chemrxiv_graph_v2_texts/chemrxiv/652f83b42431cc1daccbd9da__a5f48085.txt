Description:
An amino alcohol motif found in complex phospholipids influencing membrane properties.

Text:
Cell membranes comprise a chemically diverse set of phos
pholipids.1 In bacteria and eukaryotes, cell membranes are 
made predominantly of complex phospholipids bearing 2
amino alcohol motifs (e.g. choline, ethanolamine, and serine), 
the compositional and functional diversity of which influence 
their properties, including protein binding, substrate transport, 
and cell signalling.2 Due to their ubiquitous role in compart
mentalization, phospholipids are thought to have appeared on 
Earth before the advent of cells capable of Darwinian evolu
tion.3,4 Still, prebiotic synthetic pathways that could have led to 
the diverse array of phospholipids present in modern mem
branes remain largely unexplored.
