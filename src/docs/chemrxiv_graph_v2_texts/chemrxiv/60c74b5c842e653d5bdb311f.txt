Description:
Present at two inequivalent sites forming oxide sublattices.

Text:
the Asite cation (2 or 3), Bsite cation
(4 or 5), and two inequivalent oxygen sites
(O and O), are present at the 16c, 16d, 48f
and 8a Wyckopositions.15 The inequivalent
O sites can be understood as two interpene
trating oxide sublattices.16 The Bsite cation
forms cornersharing BO6 octahedra, while the
Asite cation adopts an anticristobalite geom
etry based on cornersharing A4O tetrahedra
with linear OAO bonds. The interpenera
tion of the oxide sublattices results in distorted
hexagonal bipyramidal coordination at the A
site, with six longer equatorial AO bonds and
two shorter axial AO bonds (Figure 1). Figure 1 Pyrochlore structure showing the two oxide
sublattices forming a cornersharing network of BO6
octahedra and an anticristobalite network of corner
sharing A4O tetrahedra.
