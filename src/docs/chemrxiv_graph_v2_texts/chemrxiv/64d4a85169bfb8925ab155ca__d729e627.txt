Description:
Used as a catalyst-initiator for living ring opening polymerization of lactide.

Text:
4(Dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP) and related Lewis bases are widely 
used reagents for acylation, alkylation, condensation and transesterification 
reactions 1,2. In polymer chemistry, DMAP is used as catalystinitiator for 
living ring opening polymerization of lactide 3, in the conversion of isocyanates 
with alcohols 4 or as the initiator for aza 5 and oxaMichael polymerizations 
6,7,8,9. Further, DMAP is used in the homopolymerization of epoxy monomers 
10,11 and in the combined polymerization of epoxy monomers and esters 
11,12,13,14,15 as well as in the carbon dioxide addition to epoxides 16,17 and 
in the ring opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates 18. In these cases, the 
use of DMAP often suffers from its poor solubility in the formulations.
