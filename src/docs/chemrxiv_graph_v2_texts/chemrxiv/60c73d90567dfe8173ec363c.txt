Abstract Biodegradable polymer microneedle (MN) 
arrays are an emerging class of transdermal drug 
delivery devices that promise a painless and sanitary 
alternative to syringes; however, prototyping bespoke 
needle architectures is expensive and requires 
production of new master templates. Here, we present 
a new microfabrication technique for MNs using fused 
deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing using polylactic 
acid, an FDA approved, renewable, biodegradable, 
thermoplastic material. We show how this natural 
degradability can be exploited to overcome a key 
challenge of FDM 3D printing, in particular the low 
resolution of these printers.
