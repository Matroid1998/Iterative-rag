Description:
A neuromodulator released in the brain, gut, and blood platelets, acting through G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels.

Serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) is a neuromodulator that is released in the brain primarily by Dorsal 
25 
Raphe Nuclei neurons, in the gut by enterochromaffin cells, and in blood platelet cells.1,2 Serotonin acts 
26 
through a large family of G proteincoupled receptor (5HT1Rs, 5HT2Rs, 5HT4Rs, 5HT5Rs, 5HT6Rs, 5
27 
HT7Rs) and ion channel (5HT3Rs) subfamilies to regulate a plethora of neuronal and behavioral processes.1 
28 
Given the importance of 5HT to the regulation of mood, cognition and reward, great effort has been made 
29 
to harness pharmacology to manipulate 5HTRs for both basic study and therapeutic applications.
