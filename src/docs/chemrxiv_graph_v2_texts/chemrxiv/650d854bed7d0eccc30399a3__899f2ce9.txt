Description:
An element used in sodium-ion batteries due to its high Earth abundance.

Text:
Sodiumion batteries (SIBs) are gaining importance as promising alternatives to lithiumion 
batteries (LIBs) for grid and largescale energy storage applications due to the high Earth 
abundance of the elements used in SIBs such as Na, Fe, and Mn.1 However, the energy density 
urgently needs further improvement to meet increasing energy storage demands.1b Stable 
and highcapacity positive electrodes are a prerequisite for increasing the energy density of 
SIBs. Among the various reported cathode materials, layered oxides are ideal candidates 
because they can have tunable compositions with reasonable capacity and the 
electrochemical performance can be easily tailored by introducing different elements into the 
host structures.
