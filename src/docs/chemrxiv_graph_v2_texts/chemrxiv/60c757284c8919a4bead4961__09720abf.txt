The twodimensional (2D) materials have become very popular as reliable electrode materials for energy storage. Their
large specic surface areas offer a higher number of electrochemically active sites to store ions compared to that of bulk
counterparts. This allows 2D electrodes to have enhanced capacities. Due to the reduced distance between those active
sites in the nanosheets, fast charging and discharging rates can be achieved 6, 7 while good power densities can be
also be obtained. MXene is a large family of 2D materials with a general chemical formula of Mn1XnTx where M is
an early transition metal atom, X represents C orand N atom, and T indicates the surface termination 8, 9.
