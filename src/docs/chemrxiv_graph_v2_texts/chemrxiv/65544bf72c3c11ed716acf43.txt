Used in physisorption analysis to analyze surface defects in materials.

This anneal
ing following the CH4CVD synthesis will also improve the in
tegrity of the graphene architecture by reducing the defect con
centration, which is helpful to develop stable electrochemical de
vices using NPGs such as longlived airmetal batteries etc.18 
The quantitative evaluation of the defect type and concentration 
beforeafter annealing will be a starting point for the 
development of stateoftheart continuous porous carbon mate
rials based on NPGs chemistry,1,2 but recent investigations on the 
structural changes upon annealing by changing the size of tem
plates16,19 gave us a qualitative picture. In this work, we carefully revisited the Raman spectra of 
NPCs and NPGs to quantitatively analyze the surface defects 
with aids of temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD), Xray 
diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen physisorption analysis.

spectroscopy has been used for the structure characterization of 
2D graphenes and 1D carbon nanotubes,2024 and it could also be 
applicable to the curved 3D analogues to provide insights into 
the structural disorders which breaks the translational symmetry, 
such as edges, defects, and grain boundaries of graphenerelated 
materials.2529 The TPD, based on the detection of desorbed mol
ecules including H2, CO, and CO2, rationalizes the density of 
edges and adatoms,17 while the XRD and nitrogen physisorption 
validate the number of graphene layers in the carbon materials.2 
We found that both the NPCs and NPGs mostly consist of 
singlelayered graphene with a few single vacancies and Stone
Wales defects. In addition, a significant healing of the surface
