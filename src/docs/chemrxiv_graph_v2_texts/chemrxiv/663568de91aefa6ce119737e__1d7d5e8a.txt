Molecular oxygens ready ability to form stable complexes with transition metals is crucial for
cellular respiration, profitable for the industrial use of many catalysts, and interesting for under
standing the fundamental forces at play in metalligand chemical bonding.14 Voluminous studies
report the reactivity of heme5 and Vaskas complex6 with small molecules, particularly O2, attest
ing to the high level of biochemical and organometallic interest in dioxygen catalysis. The breadth
of these metalO2 species is notable.
