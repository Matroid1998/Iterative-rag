Description:
Deconjugated compounds that serve as vinylogous nucleophiles in aldol reactions or Michael additions.

Despite these important progress, development 
of efficient and mild method for the construction of different functionalized 
sultones is still highly significant. On the other hand, allyl ketones are another type of synthetically 
valuable reagents that used widely in organic synthesis. Owing to the steric 
effect, these deconjugated carbonyls usually serve as vinylogous 
nucleophiles to undergo aldol reactions or Michael additions at position 
selectively8. In addition, the terminal carboncarbon double bond of allyl 
ketones can also participate in DielsAlder cyclization to form 
heterocycles9. During our research on SuFEx click reactions10, we found 
that allyl ketones do not undergo the anticipated selective Michael 
addition with the active ethenesulfonyl fluoride. Interestingly, an 
unexpected selective Michael additionSuFEx cyclization reaction 
performed to produce alkenylated sultones efficiently. Herein, we
