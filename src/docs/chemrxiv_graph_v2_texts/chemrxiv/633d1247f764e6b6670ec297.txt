Description:
A substrate that can undergo alkylation reactions multiple times but stops selectively after a given number of iterations.

Selectivity plays a crucial role in organic synthesis. Selective reactions are most commonly categorized 
as chemoselective,1,2 regioselective,1,3 and stereoselective.1,4 There is, however, one type of selectivity 
commonly encountered in various reactions (e.g. substitutions, polymerizations, etc.) that does not fit 
in these three categories. The purpose of this work is to present the selectivity observed when a given 
reaction can occur at least twice on a substrate (e.g. the alkylation of ethylene glycol, see Figure 1A) 
but stops selectively after a given number of iterations i. This is distinct from selectivity imposed 
through sequential reactions,5 and applies only to onepot reactions.

Description:
A compound that can undergo iterative alkylation reactions.

In 2014, we proposed to name 
this selectivity iteroselectivity6 (Figure 1B) and, since then, this term was used in various articles.715 
To the best of our knowledge, the concepts arising from this type of selectivity have not been yet 
properly named and defined in the literature. Herein, we propose to define properly this type of selectivity and related concepts, to compare it to 
the three main types of selectivity in organic synthesis (see Figure 2 for an overview of the comparison), 
and to list some concrete examples from the literature. Figure 1. Iterative reactions that may show iteroselectivity. (A) The alkylation of ethylene glycol is a simple 
example of iterative reaction. (B) Substrates bearing several identical functions can react iteratively in a 
single pot.
