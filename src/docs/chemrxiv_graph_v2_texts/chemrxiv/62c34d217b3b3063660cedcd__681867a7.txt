Versatile building blocks for the construction of complex organic structures.

Dialkyl ketones are an essential class of organic molecules 
found in abundance in nature as well as in many 
pharmaceuticals, fragrances and fine chemicals. They are also 
versatile building blocks for the construction of complex 
organic structures and offer multiple opportunities for 
functional group interconversion and latestage derivatization 
of drug and natural productlike molecules.1 The rich and 
diverse chemical structures provided by dialkyl ketones still 
challenge the synthetic chemist to develop new practical and 
flexible methods for their efficient preparation. While 
nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions of activated carboxylic 
acid derivatives stand as the most versatile approaches to 
unsymmetrical dialkyl ketones,2 today the development of new 
strategies that circumvent the classical need for premade 
sensitive and basic aliphatic organometallic reagents has 
become a fertile area of research.

Description:
Produced with unique functional group tolerance through coupling of reactive electrophiles.

Text:
Modern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to 
this area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical 
pathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild 
conditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of 
acyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and 
(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, 
alkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky 
reagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful 
strategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet 
highly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a 
practical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with 
unique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess 
amounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically 
used to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel 
catalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale 
applications.
