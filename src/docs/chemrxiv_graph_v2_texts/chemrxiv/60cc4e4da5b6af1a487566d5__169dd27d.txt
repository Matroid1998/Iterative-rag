Description:
A redox-active species in Li-ion batteries.

As the demand for electrochemical energy storage surges, 
the research, development and application of new systems 
require comprehensive understanding of the electrochem
ical properties at an everincreasing pace. A critical param
eter for the community, from materials chemists to appli
cation engineers, is the diffusion coefficient of the redox
active species; i.e., Li, in the case of Liion batteries. The 
GITT has been the most widely applied method for deriv
ing the diffusion coefficient from electrochemical meas
urements. Derived from Ficks second law, GITT was first 
demonstrated in 1977 for a bulk Li3Sb electrode.1 The tech
nique consists of two repeating steps. First, a constant cur
rent is applied for a duration where the assumption of 
semiinfinite diffusion holds.
