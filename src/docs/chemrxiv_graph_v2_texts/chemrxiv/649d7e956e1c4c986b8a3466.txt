Description:
Derived diazoketones are important reagents in organic synthesis.

Text:
Amino acids derived diazoketones (AADDKs) are an im
portant class of reagents in organic synthesis.1,2 Using natu
ral proteinogenic amino acids as starting material enables 
easy access to chiral AADDKs. Therefore, these reagents 
could be considered as part of a chiral pool.3,4 Recently, a 
number of preparative methods for the synthesis of Med
Chemrelevant compounds based on AADDK reagents have 
been developed.5 In particular, preparations of chiral 
amino acids,6 azetidin3ones,7,8 lactams,9,10 oxazinones,11 
dihydropyridones,12 Nprotected aminoglyoxals and he
tarylaminomethyl derivatives13 are worth mentioning 
(Figure 1, A).

Description:
N-protected derivatives interact with diazomethane for efficient preparation of AADDKs.

Text:
Despite the existing alternative approaches to 
preparation of AADDKs emerged in the literature, 1,2,13 inter
action of activated derivatives of Nprotected amino acids 
with diazomethane still remains the most efficient 
method.14 However, high toxicity and explosiveness of 
CH2N2 strongly limit both availability and utility of the 
AADDKs even in mediumscale laboratory syntheses.
