Description:
A radioactive tracer used in PET imaging to report on aberrant energy metabolism in cancers.

18FFluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron 
Emission Tomography (FDG PET) is the most widely clinically applied molecular imaging technique that 
reports on aberrant energy metabolism, which is a hallmark of many cancers. Despite limitations 
(including long examination times 1h and the use of ionizing radiation), this radioactive tracer has 
revolutionized treatment and management of many cancers. Its success relies on the FDG uptake, 
which is elevated in proliferating tumors. However, PET is not able to distinguish between metabolic 
products. Nonradioactive molecular contrast agents providing deeper insights in aberrant metabolism 
with faster scan time are needed. Hyperpolarized (HP) 113Cpyruvate MRI has shown great promise
