Description:
Used in reactions to form isostructural species.

Text:
Analogous reactions 
replacing the pyridine with picoline, 4ethylpyridine, isoquinolene, 3,4lutidine, results in a series of 
isostructural species.13 Addition of different bases, templates and solvent combinations results in the 
formation of the related, but larger Fe30 and Fe34 clusters.14,15 Herein, we extend this methodology 
to the use of 4methoxypyridine (MeOpy) and the synthesis of the smallest member of this molecular 
iron oxide family, an Fe8 cage.
