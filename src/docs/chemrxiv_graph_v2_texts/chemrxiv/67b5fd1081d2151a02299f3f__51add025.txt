One of the most efficient strategies for generating reactive 
radical species is ligandtometal charge transfer (LMCT).11, 
12 Among the various metals capable of undergoing charge
transfer chemistry, cerium stands out as an appealing op
tion due to its abundance in the Earths crust and suitable 
redox window, featuring oxidation states of 3 and 4.
