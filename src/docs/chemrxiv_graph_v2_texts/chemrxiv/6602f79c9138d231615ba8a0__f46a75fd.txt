Description:
A uniquely tailorable source of openshell materials with a diradicaloid aromatic structure in resonance with its closeshell quinoidal counterpart.

Most studies rely on an external chemical5,9 or electrochemical potential1012 to keep the molecular wire 
in its openshell state, as selfimmolation of the openshell state13 by charge transfer tofrom the metallic 
electrodes is likely to occur at room temperature. In fact, while many openshell molecular wires have 
been reported having retention of their radical nature at low temperature even in the absence of an 
external potential,14,15 very few studies exist on the same happening at room temperature, and these 
are limited to exceptionally stable structures bearing a single radical state such as Kuhns Verdazyls,4 
CF3stabilised Blatter radicals,6 or fluorenyl species.16 
Quinoidal polycyclic hydrocarbons are a uniquely tailorable source of openshell materials.17,18 In these 
materials an openshell, diradicaloid aromatic structure is in resonance with its closeshell quinoidal 
counterpart.
