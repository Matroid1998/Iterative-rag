Description:
A compound that inhibits the release of 2Fe2S clusters to apoacceptors in vitro.

Text:
The reduced cluster is kinetically inert6, 7, and it can be 
releasedtransferred to apoacceptor(s)4 (and increasingly so by lowering the pH) upon oxidation. Aberrant cluster in disease conditions release can lead to cell derangement. Recently, these proteins have emerged as attractive targets for pharmacological intervention. Indeed, small molecules binding to these proteins5, 810 have been shown to modulate the kinetics 
of cluster release. For instance, compound A in Fig. 1 accelerates the 2Fe2S clusters of mNT 
and NAF1 release to apoacceptors in vitro, while furosemide does the opposite (Fig. 1)9. Hence, 
in principle, specific ligands could be used to restore the normal functioning of these proteins. 4
