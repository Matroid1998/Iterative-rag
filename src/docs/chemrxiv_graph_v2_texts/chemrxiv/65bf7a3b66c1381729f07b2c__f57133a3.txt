Description:
A plant-derived compound used as a soft segment in multiblock copolymers.

Text:
For example, in our earlier work, plantderived dilinoleic diol (DLA
OH) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) as soft segments were introduced to the PBS chain10. This allows 
for the creation of multiblock copolymers with a wide range of physicochemical and mechanical properties 
by adjusting the hard and soft segments ratio 12, 13, resulting in materials with rubberlike elasticity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023xdj5wv4 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000224743517 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
