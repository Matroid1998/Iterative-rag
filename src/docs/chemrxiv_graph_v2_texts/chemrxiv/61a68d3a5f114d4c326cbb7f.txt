Description:
Involved in the 2e reduction process to produce H2O2.

Text:
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally benign oxidant with diverse industrial 
applications, including paperbleaching, wastewater treatment and chemical manufacturing. While conventionally produced via the anthraquinone process, there is a growing push to 
generate H2O2 through electrochemical means.1 Doing so would circumvent the necessity of 
using H2 and volatile H2O2 mixtures, as well as issues with catalyst recyclability. Further, 
electrochemical H2O2 synthesis would enable a decentralization of its production, given the 
relative simplicity of the equipment necessary for this. Typically, H2O2 (or HO2 in basic 
solutions) is produced via the 2e reduction of O2, a process that is in competition with the 
thermodynamically easier 4e reduction pathway to H2O.
