Description:
Organic hypervalent compounds useful in synthetic processes.

Text:
Organic hypervalent Iodine(III) compounds (3iodanes) are useful synthetic compounds 
which facilitate many different organic and inorganic synthetic processes.1 Typically, 3
iodanes present as Tshaped phenyl substituted species with the general formula of PhI(L)2. The dihalogenated species of PhIX2 (Scheme 1), where X is Cl or F have received extensive 
attention as safer and easier to handle sources of their elemental counterparts in F2 and Cl2.2 

Scheme 1. Structure for wellestablished dihalogenated PhI(III) species. Though these species are easy to handle, bench stable sources of Cl2 and F2, their downside is 
that they are considered less reactive than their diatomic elemental counterparts.
