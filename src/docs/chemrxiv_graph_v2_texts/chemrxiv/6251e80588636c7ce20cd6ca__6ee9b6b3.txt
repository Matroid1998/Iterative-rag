Description:
Species that are bactericidal and cytotoxic.

Text:
For instance,
monophosphonium species, as well as the corresponding ammonium species, are bactericidal as
well as cytotoxic,7,8 therefore the real novelty of DxC10Cl2 is that this bactericidal dication
is not severely toxic to mammalian cells, opening the way to pharmaceutical applications. This
specicity points to some peculiar mechanism of action for DxC102, and to a sizeable margin
for optimising its antimicrobial properties by structureactivity studies covering broad families
of related compounds. In interpreting these observations, however, one should also consider that
selectivity in the biological eect might also arise from structural and water solvation properties
