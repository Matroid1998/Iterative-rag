Description:
A molecule whose dissociation limit is accurately captured by DM21 when trained on the hydrogen atom with zero polarization.

Text:
Trained on fractional spin (FS) DM21 can capture
some multireference effects in main group chemistry,
such as stretching covalent bonds, though it encounters
difficulties at intermediate bond distances. For exam
ple, training DM21 on the hydrogen atom with zero
polarization ensures the accurate H2 dissociation limit
without breaking spin symmetry. Focusing on dimers,
maingroup dimers primarily exhibit multireference ef
fects when their bonds are stretched, whereas transition
metal dimers display these effects even at their equi
librium geometries. Thus, the difference in the nature
of multireference effects between maingroup and TMC
raises the question of whether DM21s ability to capture
such effects in the former can extend to the latter.
