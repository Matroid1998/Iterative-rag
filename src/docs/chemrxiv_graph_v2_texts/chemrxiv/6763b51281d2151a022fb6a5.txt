Description:
An element that is part of molecular systems in the ANI MLIPs.

The accurate neural network engine 
for molecular energies (ANI)17,18 family of MLIPs were some of the earliest models to achieve reliable 
predictions for millions of molecular systems composed of H, C, N, O, F, Cl, and S.19 The ANI MLIPs are 
effective for cases where physical and chemical characteristics can reasonably be approximated using only 
shortrange truncated chemical environments; however, different model architectures are required for 
systems with many elements, nonlocal behavior, openshells, and charged species.
