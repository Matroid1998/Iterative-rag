Description:
Materials whose energetic properties are influenced by the nature and concentration of electrolytes.

For instance,
it was shown that intrusion of a highly concentrated LiCl solution (20 M) in silicalite1
increases intrusion pressure from 96 MPa (for pure water) to 280 MPa, resulting in an in
crease of stored energy from 10 Jg to 31 Jg. Since this pioneering work, the influence of
the nature of the electrolyte and its concentration on the energetic properties of zeosils has
been widely investigated.2137
In a previous study, we have reported a computational investigation of the effect of the
electrolyte solution (nature and concentration) on their intrusion pressure in defectfree pure
silica zeolites.38 We found that due to poorer ion solvation in the pores than in the bulk,
intrusion of electrolyte solutions starts with only intrusion of pure water (and exclusion of
the ions).
