Description:
Has good activating properties.

This material is already regularly used to partially replace 
37 
clinker in cements4 and is consequently interesting in itself but it also represents a good model 
38 
for all alkaliactivated cements formulations based on Capoor glasses of low hydraulicity. 39 
Regarding the activators, the most promising ones appear to be sodium hydroxide  a strong 
40 
base, sodium carbonate  a weak base, and sodium silicate, as they can be easily supplied and 
41 
have good activating properties4. 42 
During the hydration reaction of alkaliactivated slag cements, hydrates, different from 
43 
those found in more traditional cements and following a different sequence, are formed. This 
44 
has been reviewed in numerous textbooks4,5 and articles,6,7 and is still the subject of active 
45 
research.
