Description:
Widely used as an antifungal medication.

Enantiopure aminoalcohols are ubiquitous in natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients 
(APIs), and agrochemicals. The 2amino1arylethanol unit, in particular, is frequently 
encountered (Figure 1A).14 For example, Econazole (1) is widely used as an antifungal 
medication5,6; Indacaterol (2) and Salmeterol (3) are effective bronchodilators and enlisted as top
selling small molecule drugs7; a unique boroncontaining molecule GSK656 (4) is a promising 
antituberculosis drug with a new mechanism of action.8,9 Synthetic approaches to molecules of 
this sort generally rely on a deliberate 
construction of the aminoalcohol in a stepwise 
fashion rather than a modular installation 
through crosscoupling.13 Indeed, constructing 
the chiral aminoalcohol motifs in 14 requires 
multiple steps, all of which are reliant on polar 
bond retrosynthetic analysis (Figure 1B).
