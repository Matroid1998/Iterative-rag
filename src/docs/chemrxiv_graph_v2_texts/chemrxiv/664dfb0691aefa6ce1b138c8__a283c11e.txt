Description:
An anti-VEGF antibody used in molecular targeted therapy.

Text:
Significant advances in therapy have been 
made in the past years, particularly with molecular targeted drugs 
such as the antiVEGF antibody bevacizumab (VEGF  Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor) and PARP inhibitors (PARP  Poly 
ADP Ribose Polymerase) like olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib.3 
However, given the rarity of mismatch repairdeficient Epithelial 
Ovarian Cancer (EOC) and the limited efficacy demonstrated by 
immunotherapies, with a low response rate in OC, the 
development of new targeted drugs and biomarkers remains
