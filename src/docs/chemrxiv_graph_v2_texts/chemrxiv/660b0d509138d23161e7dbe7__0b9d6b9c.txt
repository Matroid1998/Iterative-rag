Description:
Used in single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes to enhance ionic conductivity.

Text:
Inorganic electrolytes can present fast ion 
conductivity in concert with high modulus and thermal stability.4 Nonetheless, difficulties in 
manufacturing, sensitivity to moisture, and brittleness have slowed their application.2 Alternatively, 
singleion conducting polymer electrolytes have better compatibility with electrodes and are amenable for 
lowcost industrialscale processing.1,5,6 However, dry singleion conducting polymer electrolytes 
demonstrated thus far have ionic conductivity that is too low for most applications, with the best reported 
values of Li conductivity of 1  104 Scm at 6090  achieved with ionomers containing highly 
dissociable bound anions in contact with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain segments through either 
copolymerization or blending.1,5,7 The ionic conductivity in these PEObased singleion conducting 
polymers is dependent upon the segmental relaxation rate of the polymer chains solvating Li, the ion pair 
binding energy, and the interaction of the bound anionic site with the cationsolvating PEO.
