Description:
Formed by silylation with a distorted structure due to steric demand.

Text:
Okuda achieved high silylation degrees by 
reaction of iron(II) halides with tris(1,2,4TMS)cyclopentadienyllithium to yield 1,1,2,2,4,4
hexakis(trimethylsilyl)ferrocene. As a consequence of the steric demand a distorted structure of the 
silylated Cp ligands is observed.32 Butler et al. reported an alternative approach for 
hexakis(trimethylsilyl)ferrocene 
including 
a 
lithiumhalogen 
exchange 
of 
1,1,2,2,3,3
hexabromoferrocene followed by silylation with TMSCl.33 Recently, some of us reported an improved 
synthetic protocol for decabromoferrocene34 by bromination of FeC10(Hg(O2CC3H7)10.35 The 
reaction pathway emerging from perbrominated ferrocene is supposed to be a promising route to 
persilylation.
