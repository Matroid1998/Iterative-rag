Description:
A prominent group of biodegradable polymers characterized by good mechanical parameters, consistent properties, and biocompatibility.

Text:
Biodegradable polymers have gained a lot of interest in recent decades. Their ability to biodegrade under 
natural environmental conditions, combined with their biological safety, has led to their increasing use in 
various areas of our lives, such as the packaging industry, agriculture, geotextiles, pharmaceuticals or medicine 
1,2. A growing field of application for such polymers is biomaterial applications which are directly related 
to the regeneration or repair of human tissues. The term of biomaterials is used to describe, for example, 
drug carriers, tissue scaffolds or other biomedical devices such as sutures, pins, meshes or tissuestabilising 
elements 1,3. Among the biodegradable polymers, aliphatic polyesters, such as polylactide (PLA), 
poly(lactidecoglycolide) (PLGA) or polycaprolactone (PCL), are a prominent group, characterised by good 
mechanical parameters, consistent properties and biocompatibility 4.
