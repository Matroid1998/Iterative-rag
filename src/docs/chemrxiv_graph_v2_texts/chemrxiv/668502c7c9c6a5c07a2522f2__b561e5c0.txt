(CH3)2NH2M(HCOO)3 (with M2  Ni2, Co2, Zn2 and Mn2),24,25 
C(NH2)3M(HCOO)3 (with M2  Co2 and Mn2)26 and 
Pr4NM(C2N3)3 (with Pr4N  tetrapropylammonium, M2  
Ni2, Co2 and Mn2)27 have demonstrated that a smaller size of 
M2 paired with a larger ligand field stabilisation energy (LFSE) 
leads to a larger Youngs modulus and B. These findings agree 
with our recent results, where we observed a decreasing B as a 
function of increasing Shannon ionic radius of M2.28 
Looking at the role of A, its capability to form hydrogen 
bonding interactions20,29 (HBIs) to the MX3 network has been 
found to be an important factor. For instance, the mechanical 
properties
