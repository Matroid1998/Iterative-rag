Description:
A material variant of LiCoO2 used in lithium-ion batteries to enhance performance and reduce cost.

Inercalation voltages
are calculated and discussed as a predictive metric for potential functionality of the
model materials. Introduction
Manufacturing of nanoscale complex metal oxides (CMOs) is on the rise, concurrent with
their use in mobile devices and renewable energy applications.13 A key example is the de
lafossite structure type, which has found increased use as one of the prominent families of in
tercalation materials used in lithiumion batteries (LIBs). The delafossite CMOs used in LIBs
are the electroactive components of the cathode,47 and the prototypical example is LiCoO2
(LCO). To decrease the cost and increase the performance of materials based on LCO, com
positional tuning has led to Li(Ni13Mn13Co13)O2 (NMC) materials,811 and other variants
