Description:
A natural substrate hydrolyzed by GCPII in the nervous system, participating in signal transmission.

Text:
Within the 
nervous system and small intestine, GCPII hydrolyzes its two recognized natural substrates, N
acetyl aspartylglutamate (NAAG) and folylpolyglutamates, participating directly in signal 
transmission via neural pathways and intestinal folate absorption, respectively. In the kidney and 
prostate, the physiological function remains unknown. 3
