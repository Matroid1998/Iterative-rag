Description:
A strongly donating group that can change excited-state character in ligand frameworks.

Text:
A constant challenge in the design of these complexes
is the extension of their absorption to the visible and
nearinfrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spec
trum. We have shown that by introducing a strongly
donating group like NMe2 in a remote position of the
ligand framework, there is a change in the excitedstate
character (e.g. between complexes 1a and 1b, Scheme 1)
from metaltoligand charge transfer (MLCT) to intrali
gand charge transfer (ILCT). This resulted in a red shift
of ca.
