Incorporated into substrates to enable cross coupling reactions.

Methods for sp2 CH alkylation, particularly for electron deficient aromatics, are limited with 
traditional methods such as FriedelCrafts alkylation reacting preferentially with electron rich 
organic aromatics.1,2 CH alkylation is usually impractical and requires the use of super
stoichiometric organolithium or toxic organomercury reagents (Fig. 1a).3,4 Instead of using a 
direct CH functionalisation strategy, a halogen handle is often incorporated into the 
substrate to enable traditional palladiumbased cross coupling reactions or recently developed 
photoredox nickel cross coupling (Fig. 1a).58 Minisci coupling does avoid the need for a 
functional handle and offers a reliable radical based route to CH alkylate pyridines. However, it also exhibits significant limitations such as providing solely C2 selectivity and 
requiring strong acidic conditions limiting its functional group tolerance (Fig.
