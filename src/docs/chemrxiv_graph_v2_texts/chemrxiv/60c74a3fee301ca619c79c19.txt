Description:
Derivatives can enhance or redshift absorption into the near-infrared spectral range.

Text:
This strong 
absorption can be enhanced or redshifted into the nearinfrared 
(NIR) spectral range, such as in heptamethine derivatives, by 
simple engineering of the extremities or elongation of the 
conjugated pathways.13 The cyanine emission exhibits a very 
small Stokes shift, signature of a minimal excited state molecular 
relaxation. Within the cyanine family, pentamethines and heptamethines with 
five and sevencarbon bridges, respectively, have attracted 
much attention for applications in bioimaging and material 
science.49 Commercially available indocyanine green, is largely
