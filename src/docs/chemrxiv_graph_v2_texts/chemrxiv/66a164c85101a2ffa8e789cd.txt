Description:
Materials known for high exciton diffusivity and quantum coherent light emission.

Text:
More recently, studies on superlattices of lead halide perovskites (CsPbX3, where X  Cl, Br, 
I) have drawn attention to excitonic coupling, which in these materials results in an unusually 
high exciton diffusivity7 and in quantum coherent light emission known as 
superfluorescence.8 Both phenomena are reportedly mediated by dipoledipole coupling,911 
which depends on the relative spatial position and exciton energy of the interacting particles.
