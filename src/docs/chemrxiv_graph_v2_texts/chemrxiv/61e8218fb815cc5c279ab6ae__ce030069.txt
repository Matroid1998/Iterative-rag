Thus, the design of a multicomponent , singlestep reaction 
to afford a diverse array of amidines, especially those with 
three aromatic substituents decorating the conjugated 
amine core, is both synthetically challenging and appealing 
as a gateway to numerous untapped applications. Scheme 1. (a) examples of bioactive compounds bearing an 
amidine core (b) selected approaches for the preparation of 
amidines and the methodology presented in this work
