Description:
Predominantly aromatic derivatives used as fragments, building blocks, or scaffolds in drug design.

Text:
of the concept of leadoriented 
synthesis and the shift from planar aromatic fragments to the 
saturated counterparts, the scientific communitys focus 
turned towards small saturated molecules. These derivatives 
increasingly utilized as fragments, building blocks, or 
scaffolds in the design of biologically active compounds. This paradigm extended to the chemical space of 
sulfonamides, 
which 
were 
predominantly 
aromatic 
derivatives (including compounds 15), and sultams, 
primarily represented by derivatives of saccharin 7 and 
related aromatic systems 810.2729 Consequently, sp3
enriched saturated and partially unsaturated scaffolds have 
emerged as promising examples accompanying the current 
tendencies in drug design.30 Notably, the list of saturated 
sultams includes the anticonvulsant drug sulthiame 11,31 a 
combination of acyclic and cyclic sulfonamides, specifically 
1,2thiazinan1,1dioxide (Figure 2). Some articles have 
explored distinct categories of other sultams,32 e.g.
