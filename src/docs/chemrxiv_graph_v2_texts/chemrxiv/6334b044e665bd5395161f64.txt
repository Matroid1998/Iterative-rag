Description:
Known to form chemically and structurally labile membranes.

Vesicles have many applications from microreactors1 and sensors2, to drug delivery vectors 35 
and models for cell membrane research.6, 7 Lipids and amphiphilic block copolymers are common 
materials for fabrication of synthetic or model membrane vesicles in the form of liposomes and 
polymersomes, respectively.8 More recently, there has been significant interest in hybrid vesicles 
for technological applications that combine advantageous material properties from blended lipid and 
block copolymer components.917 
Inclusion of membrane proteins within the vesicle membrane opens a range of potential 
applications, from carriers and bioreactors for drug delivery to sensors and artificial cells. 6, 18 
Classically, membrane proteins have been reconstituted into liposomes because their membranes 
most closely resemble their native biomembrane environment. 19, 20 However, phospholipid 
membranes are known to be chemically and structurally labile.
