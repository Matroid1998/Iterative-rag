Description:
A gas mixture relevant for separations in polymer gas-separation membranes.

Text:
Increasing gas permeability and selectivity in these membranes would allow for 
more efficient industrial processes by increasing the process throughput, reducing energy costs, 
and achieving a purer product810. However, there is a wellknown permeabilityselectivity trade
off for polymer gasseparation membranes7, which is defined by the Robeson upper bound11. Over 
time, advancements in polymer designs have pushed the Robeson upper bound from 1991 values 
to updated 2008 values (and most recently 2015 values for O2N2 separations and 2019 values for 
CO2CH4 and CO2N2 separations12,13) that reflect improved membrane performance. Identifying 
new materials that break this upper bound has driven and continues to drive materials discovery 
efforts for membranes1417.
