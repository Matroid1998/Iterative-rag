5hydroxytryptamine (5HT), more commonly known as serotonin, is a signaling biochemical involved 
27

in many of the human physiology but most notably in the brain function. It is involved in the regulation 
28

of many physiological signaling including sleep, hunger, and mood control 1. It plays a crucial role 
29

in both the central as well as the peripheral nervous system 2,3. In particular, the role of serotonin in 
30

mental and physical health such as depression 4,5 and cancer 69 have been well documented 
31

10,11. As a result, there has been a high demand of medical diagnostics based on serotonin detection 
32

from biological fluids 1214.
