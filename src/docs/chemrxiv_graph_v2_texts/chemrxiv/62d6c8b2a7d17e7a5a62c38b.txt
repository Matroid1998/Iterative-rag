Description:
Building blocks whose relative alignment affects the energy barrier in isomer transformations.

Text:
In recent work by Petkov et al.,17 by
using DFT calculations they observed the winerack move
ment of the stable isomers of DUT8 originated from the
longrange orientation of the linkers, which may point up
or down relative to each paddlewheel building block. They
discovered that the isomers possess different energy barriers
to transform from the open form to the closed form, which
results in reduced flexibility in one of the isomers. The
energy barrier difference arises due to the different relative
alignment of the naphthalene building blocks. Wang et al.,18 investigated the impact of ligand
originated isomerism and ligand functionalization on gas ad
sorption of NbO type MOFs.
