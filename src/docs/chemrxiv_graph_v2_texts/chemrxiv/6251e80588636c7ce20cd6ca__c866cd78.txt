Description:
Salts behave like broad spectrum antibacterial species, active at low molar concentration against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

A few year ago, the attention was briey sparked by the discovery of a new family of closely
related compounds, collectively known as phosphonium dications,6 consisting of two tetraalkyl
phosphonium cations Pijkl linked by an aliphatic chain (Cn) made of n CH2 monomers,
displaying promisingly high antimicrobial and low cytotoxic activity. Several of these com
pounds, that can be synthesized on a large scale from commercially available precursors, are
stable and liquid at room temperature,6 and thus belong to the vast class of room temperature
ionic liquid (IL, for short) compounds. According to Ref. 6 phosphonium dication salts behave like broad spectrum antibacterial
species, active at low molar concentration against both Gramnegative and Grampositive
bacteria. In the cases tested in Ref.
