Description:
A compound involved in the global transition towards carbon neutrality.

Text:
Electrochemistry or more specifically electrocatalysis plays a central role in the global transition towards CO2
neutrality.13 Examples are water electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen or carbonbased 
synthetic fuels.2, 48 Improved insight in basic principles could accelerate the knowledgeguided 
development of new catalyst materials with improved energetic efficiency.912 In this context, we address 
the question why the reaction rate of the electrocatalyst materials (and thus the production current) depends on 
the electrode potential.
