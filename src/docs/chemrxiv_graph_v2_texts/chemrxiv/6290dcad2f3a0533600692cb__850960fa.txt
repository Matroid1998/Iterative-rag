Description:
Involves condensed phase experiments for catalysis and provides a complementary molecular-level understanding through gas phase study of isolated mass-selected metal oxide clusters.

Nickel oxides are an important class of catalytic materials with a wide range of industrial 
applications including the formation of syngas,1, 2 oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes,3, 4 and 
carbon monoxide oxidation.5 Therefore, understanding their properties is of both technological 
and fundamental importance. While much of the emphasis of nickel oxide catalysis involves 
condensed phase experiments, the gas phase study of isolated massselected metal oxide clusters 
provides a complementary molecularlevel understanding of the structure and reactivity of these 
species.6, 7 Here, we report highresolution anion photoelectron spectra of cryogenically cooled 
NiO2, revealing a wealth of vibronic structure throughout the three lowestlying electronic 
states of NiO2.
