Description:
A greenhouse gas that can be captured and converted into chemicals like methanol.

. The United States (US) chemical industry consumes roughly 7,000 trillion BTUs of energy 
annually, accounting for over 10 of the total energy consumption in 20181. As such, the chemical industry 
contributes a significant fraction of the US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ranking 7th amongst 
anthropogenic contributors2. The deepening climate emergency underscores the urgent need to reduce 
the carbon footprint of manufacturing; key contributors to this footprint are the combustion of fossil fuels 
and the production of basic feedstocks. A potential decarbonization strategy consists of capturing and 
converting emitted CO2 into chemicals (e.g., producing methanol through CO2 hydrogenation); alternatively, 
it is also possible to reduce the generation of CO2 during the production of key feedstocks (such as 
hydrogen)3.

Description:
Emissions are significantly generated from hydrogen production via steam-methane reforming.

Text:
Hydrogen production, in particular, accounts for 3 of the global CO2 emissions4; this is 
because nearly 50 of all the hydrogen in the world is produced via steammethane reforming (SMR), 
which is an energyintensive process5. It is estimated that the global warming potential (GWP) of producing 
1 kg of hydrogen via SMR is 11.8 CO2eq kg6. Electrolytic watersplitting (e.g., using lowcarbon electricity obtained from renewables) can facilitate the 
reduction of the CO2 footprint of hydrogen production. In addition, this provides a synergistic approach for 
helping the power grid balance operations, which is becoming increasingly challenging as more solar and 
wind power are injected in the grid7.
