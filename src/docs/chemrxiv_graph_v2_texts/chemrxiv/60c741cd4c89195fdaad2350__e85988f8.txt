Description:
Rigid molecules used in hydrogen bonded organic frameworks with low bulk densities and high surface area.

To tackle this, we have 
used crystal structure prediction (CSP)25,26 to guide the dis
covery of molecular crystals with porous host struc
tures.27,28 In a recent study, calculated energystructure
function maps28,29 were used to prescreen the probable 
function of molecules in silico prior to experiment; in this 
case, for porosity, methane storage capacity, and guest 
molecule selectivity. This led to the discovery of hydrogen 
bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) based on rigid trip
tycene benzimidazalones with unprecedentedly low bulk 
densities (0.41 g cm3) and apparent BrunauerEmmett
Teller surface area (SABET) as high as 3230 m2 g1.28 The ex
perimental porous crystal structures were found to corre
spond to low density, stable regions, or spikes on the en
ergydensity representation of the predicted crystal energy 
landscape.
