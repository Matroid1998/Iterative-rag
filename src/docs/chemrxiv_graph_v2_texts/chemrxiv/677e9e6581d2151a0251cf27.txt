Description:
A thermoplastic polymer derived from petrochemical sources, known for its durability against environmental factors.

Text:
Since the advent of the first synthetic polymer, plastics have proliferated exponentially, 
driven by mass production and rapid expansion. Among the most prevalent are 
thermoplastic polymers, like polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), and polystyrene (PS), 
all derived from nonrenewable petrochemical sources 1. These polymers, engineered to 
be lowcost and highly adaptable, exhibit resilience against various environmental factors 
such as microbial degradation, light exposure, and water permeation. This durability 
makes them indispensable for everyday applications, such as packaging and biomedical. However, their longevity poses a significant environmental threat when they are exposed 
to the environment in the form of plastic litter 24.
