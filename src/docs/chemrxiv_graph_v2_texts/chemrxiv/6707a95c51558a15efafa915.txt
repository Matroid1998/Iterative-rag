Description:
A divalent cation used in metal halide perovskites.

Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates in the field of photocatalytic activity, 
photovoltaics (PV), lightemitting applications, and lasers due to their versatile composition, 
crystalline structure, and tunable optical properties.13 Generally, the metal halide perovskites 
(HPs) are expressed in the form of ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (organic or inorganic), 
B is a divalent cation (Pb2, Sn2, Ge2), and X is the halide anion (Cl, Br, or I).4 The 
dimensionality of the perovskite crystalline structure is defined by the connectivity of BX64 
octahedra (cornerssharing) and classified from zero to threedimension (0D3D), where ABX3 is 
3D, and A4BX6 is the 0D.3 This variation in the crystalline structure significantly affects the 
optical properties of the perovskite materials.
