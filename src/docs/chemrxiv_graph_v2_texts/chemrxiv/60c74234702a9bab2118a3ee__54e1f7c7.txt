Description:
A genotoxic compound that is chemically stable during food processing.

The European Food Safety Authority released a dietary 
61 
exposure assessment evaluating the four Alternaria toxins alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl 
62 
ether (AME), tentoxin (TEN), tenuazonic acid (TeA). For the genotoxic AOH and AME, estimated 
63 
exposure levels indicated a possible health concern (EFSA, 2011, 2016). These toxins were also shown 
64 
to be chemically relatively stable during food processing (Estiarte et al., 2018; Siegel et al., 2010). 65 
ATXII is significantly more genotoxic than AOH (Fleck et al., 2012; Schuchardt et al., 2014; Schwarz et 
66 
al., 2012a), however, it has not been reported in naturally contaminated food so far. Due to the lack 
67 
of commercially available reference material, it is not included in standard assays.
