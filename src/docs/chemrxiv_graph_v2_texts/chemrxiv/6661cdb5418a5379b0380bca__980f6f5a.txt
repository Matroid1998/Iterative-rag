Description:
Participates in concentration fluctuations when dissolved in ammonia solutions.

Text:
A phenomenon that has been closely connected to
the EMT mechanism concerns inhomogeneities or fluc
tuations of concentration occurring in the alkali metal
ammonia solutions in the intermediate range of 18
MPM.13,14 Experimental evidence for microscopic struc
tural inhomogeneities was first provided by Xray diffrac
tion studies.15 Subsequently, large concentration fluctu
ations in lithium and sodium ammonia solutions were
deduced from investigations of the dependence of the
chemical potential on the alkali metal concentration.16
Finally, the nanometersized correlation lengths of the
fluctuations were derived from smallangle neutron scat
tering studies.17 Based on these experimental studies, a
model was proposed suggesting the coexistence of dilute
and concentrated voids in the intermediate concentra
tion regime, which accounted for the spatial dimensions
of the inhomogeneities.18 However, no temporal informa
tion about these fluctuations has been provided so far,
