Description:
Participates in cycloaddition reactions with maleic anhydride.

Text:
Water can be used as a reaction medium in organic chemistry. Diels and Alder mixed furan
and maleic anhydride in hot water, obtaining a cycloaddition adduct with an increased endo
selectivity compared to their organic solvent counterpart.1 However, it was not until the 1980s
that a systematic and pioneering series of papers by Breslow and coworkers established the
paradigm of water as useful and relevant in organic chemistry.
