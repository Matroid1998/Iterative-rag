Description:
Cages prone to charge transfer during collision-induced dissociation and IR photodissociation due to relatively low oxidation potential.

Text:
Previous research of gasphase clusters containing B12X122 (XH, F, Cl, Br, I) demonstrated 
that the dodecaborate cages are prone to chargetransfer during collisioninduced dissociation and 
IR photodissociation owing to their relatively low oxidation potential.13 Of the halogenated 
B12X122 species, B12F122 has the lowest oxidation potential.14 With respect to B12F122, several 
studies have explored gas phase clustering interactions with a variety of ligands,13,1518 
demonstrating that electrostatic interactions are predominantly responsible for cluster
