Since its first synthesis in 19591, bicyclo1.1.0butane (BCB) has captured the imagination of chemists 
22 
due to its innate strain energy and relative ease of assembly and handling2,3. The highly diverse reactivity 
23 
of BCBcontaining compounds, facilitated by the release of strain upon breaking the bridging C1C3 bond, 
24 
has allowed such structures to become valuable building blocks for the generation of sp3rich carbocycles 
25 
and heterocycles25. Perhaps the most prominent reactivity mode that has been utilised in this context is 
26 
the addition of nucleophiles and nucleophilic radicals to the bridgehead of electrondeficient BCB
