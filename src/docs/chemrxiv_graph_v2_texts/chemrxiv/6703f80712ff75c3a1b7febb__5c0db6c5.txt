Description:
Materials often used in humidity sensors but suffer from nonlinearity and low sensitivity.

Text:
Conventional humidity sensors, which are based, e.g., on conductive polymers,
ceramics, or metal oxides, often suffer from nonlinearity of their response isotherm, long
response and recovery time, low sensitivity, and large hysteresis, which are crucial param
eters for the reliable realtime monitoring of humidity in portable or wearable applications. To overcome these challenges, novel materials have been proposed for advanced humidity
sensing, such as supramolecular nanoassemblies,4 polymermetal nanoparticle hybrids,5 2D
materials, e.g., MXenes,6 or carbonbased materials like graphene oxide (GO), or reduced
GO (rGO).7
GObased materials are attractive candidates for detecting humidity due to GOs high
hydrophilicity, large surface area, and flexibility.
