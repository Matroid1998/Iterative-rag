Description:
Produced from ammonia and used as a reductant.

Sutton and coworkers made a breakthrough when they regenerated 
AB from PBZ by using hydrazine (N2H4) as a reductant in THF 
medium.12 Unfortunately, N2H4 is produced from ammonia which is 
synthesized by reacting N2 with H2 through a high energyconsuming 
HaberBosch process, thus essentially making the regeneration 
process unsustainable.13 Recent advances made in producing N2H4 
electrocatalytically from N2 and water with the help of solar or wind 
generated electricity, may ensure sustainability.14 Advancement in N2 
activation 
chemistry 
can 
possibly 
negate 
this 
problem.15 
 Monoboron and bisborane Lewis acid based catalysts have 
been employed to dehydrogenate AB successfully by Wegner  co
workers, with bisborane system showing slightly higher efficacy than 
that of the mono boron system.16 Wegner et. al.
