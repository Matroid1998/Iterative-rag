Over the 
past decade, activities have shifted towards fullyintegrated microsystems, with increasing research 
efforts dedicated to developing lowcost, disposable devices made from accessible materials, such as 
plastic or paper.2 Unfortunately, the fabrication of the reference electrode in these lowcost 
electrochemical cells remains a significant and unmet challenge.3 A typical electrochemical detector 
includes a reference electrode that acts as a reference potential for the working electrode.4 To ensure 
measurement stability, the reference electrode is usually made by a standard material with a known 
redox potential, such as silversilver chloride or the saturated calomel electrode.4 However, these 
materials are often incompatible with common microfabrication techniques or demand complex 
fabrication processes, thus hindering their integration into lowcost disposable cartridges.3,5 
Circumventing the overreliance on reference electrodes would enable researchers to design 
electrochemical sensors using a far broader array of substrates, and thus pave the way towards simpler 
and more accessible diagnostic technologies.
