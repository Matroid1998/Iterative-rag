Description:
Chains that render systems hydrophobic due to perfluoroperfluoro interactions.

Text:
This presents a design constraint, though this can 
also be circumvented by using hydrophobic selfassembly to immobilize the catalysts on the GDE 
surface as an alternative route. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time the deliberate integration of hydrophobicity 
into a molecular CO2R catalyst operating at the gasliquidsolid interface within a gasdiffusion 
electrode (Fig. 1a). Our system consists of Co terpyridine catalysts with perfluorinated alkyl chains 
(Co TerpyRF) that render the system hydrophobic due to the perfluoroperfluoro interactions 
between the perfluorinated alkyl chains (Fig. 1b).
