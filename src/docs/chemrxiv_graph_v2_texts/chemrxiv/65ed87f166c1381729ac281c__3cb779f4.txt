Description:
A nucleic acid base that can undergo methylation, affecting DNA structure.

The study of the native conformation of nucleic acids and its 
eventual perturbation induced by the coupling with external 
perturbation factors is fundamental to better assess the molecular 
mechanisms underlying their biological role.14 Indeed, the 
conformation of nucleic acid may change due to the interaction 
with small molecules,4 including potential chemotherapeutic 
drugs,5,6 but also due to the presence of DNA lesions, such as 
base dimerization710 or strand breaks,11,12 or because of the 
binding to functional or structural proteins.1317 Furthermore, 
DNA compaction18,19 and the presence of epigenetic markers, 
such as cytosine methylation,20 may also lead to significant 
alteration of the nucleic acid structure.
