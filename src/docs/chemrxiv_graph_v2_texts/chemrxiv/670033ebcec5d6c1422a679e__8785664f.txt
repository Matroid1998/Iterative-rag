Solidstate batteries (SSBs) are recently receiving considerable attention in the scientific 
27 
community because of their potential to outperform conventional lithiumion batteries.1,2 The 
28 
potential advantages of SSBs originate from their solid nature and singleion conductivity, 
29 
improved safety and the possibility of efficient cell stacking (bipolar stacking). 1 SSBs will likely 
30 
only overcome conventional lithiumion batteries in terms of energy density, if they feature low
31 
potential, highenergydensity anodes such as Si (ref. 3) or Limetal anodes. 4,5 Most highly
32 
conducting solid electrolytes decompose at the low potentials of Si and Li metal anodes.
