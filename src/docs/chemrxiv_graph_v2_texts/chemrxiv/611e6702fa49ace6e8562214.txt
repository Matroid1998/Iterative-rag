Description:
Has electrical conductivity that rivals electrides with bare electrons trapped at stoichiometric concentrations.

Challenges in energy storage, electronics, and catalysis motivate the search for exotic materials 
with extreme properties, and electridescrystals with bare electrons trapped at stoichiometric 
concentrations13offer some of the most exceptional. These electrons have been ejected from 
atomic orbitals to reside in vacant lattice sites and, because they are so weakly bound, are better 
electron donors than alkali metals46, can offer electrical conductivity that rivals silver, and can 
catalyze challenging reactions. These properties have led to the exploration of electrides in 
applications where electronrich materials are needed N2 and CO2 reduction7,8, battery 
electrodes9,10, and electron emitters1113. Despite this progress, rules that might predict an 
electrides properties based on its structure or composition are underdeveloped.
