Description:
Used as a heterogeneous catalyst in modified Knoevenagel reactions.

Text:
The intermediate is further 
converted into the final ,unsaturated olefin, after the elimination of water.8 
In response to the urgent need for environmentally friendly synthetic processes, alternative methods utilizing 
minimal catalysts and solvents are under exploration.9 In this context, several modifications of the traditional 
Knoevenagel reaction have been developed in recent years including the use of heterogenous catalysts (alkaliearth 
or modified silica),10 water as catalyst and solvent,11, 12 and catalystfree environments using ethanolwater as 
reaction media.13 For solutionbased conditions, the solvent and catalyst greatly affect the kinetics of the reaction, 
whereas the solidstate reaction profile is influenced by parameters such as the amount of solvent and the 
mechanical force used.1419 
Kaupp20 and Suzuki21 have shown that an efficient and quantitative Knoevenagel condensation can be achieved in 
the solid state.
