In designing membranes for separation applications,
it is essential to maximize the permeability of desired
species while maintaining a satisfactory level of selectiv
ity against undesirable species. As an example, take re
verse osmosis (RO) desalination, a critical technology for
sustainable and accessible freshwater supply.2225 An ef
fective RO membrane must have high water permeabil

ity and strong selectivity against small ionic and molec
ular solutes.
