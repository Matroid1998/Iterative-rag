Description:
Exhibits nonlinear optical responses and photoluminescence.

Only a few MOFs from the ZIF subclass have been discovered to be meltable 
before thermal decomposition; subsequent quenching of the melt led to a glassy state 
(denoted ag) with the ability to retain a certain resemblance to the original MOF6. Although 
some features of ZIF glasses remain disputed79, first reports on the optical10 and 
mechanical11 properties of agZIF62 showed promising results in terms of indeed resembling 
inorganic glass materials. For the case of cobaltsubstituted agZIF62(Co), nonlinear optical 
responses and photoluminescence were reported.12,13 All of these studies build on the 
promise that glassy MOFs could  in principle  be processed in their liquid state so as to attain 
a broad variety of geometrical shapes.
