Description:
Solvent effects were accounted for within the polarized continuum model (PCM).

Computational details
The quantum chemical calculations based on the density functional theory
(DFT) done in conjunction with this study employed the GAUSSIAN 16 9
suite of programs on the bwHPC platform 10. We used the three parameter
B3LYP hybrid DFTHF exchange correlation functional 11, 12, 13, 14 along
with the Pople 631G(d,p) basis sets 15, 16. Solvent (specically, methanol)
eects were accounted for within the polarized continuum model (PCM) 17
using the integral equation formalism (IEF) 18. For open shell radicals (ATV and ATVwoH, cf. Tables 1, S2, and S3) we
performed unrestricted (UB3LYP) calculations. Therefore, it is worth mention
