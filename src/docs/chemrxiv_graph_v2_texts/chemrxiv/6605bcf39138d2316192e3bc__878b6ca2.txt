Description:
Provides ionic conductivity by filling the pores of a separator in electrolysis.

Text:
The key 
difference between AWE and AEMbased electrolysis is that 
in the latter a nonporous polymeric membrane possessing 
intrinsic anionic conductivity is used, whereas in 
conventional AWE the porous electrode separator has no 
ionic conductivity, with conductivity being provided by 
KOH filling the pores of a separator. This allows to operate the cells at higher current densities 
due to lower ohmic resistance, as well as to pressurize 
hydrogen electrochemically, easing storage and final 
utilization, reducing the chemical risk thanks the nonporous 
nature of the polymeric membrane 4. Corresponding authors
