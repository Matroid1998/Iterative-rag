Description:
Offers intrinsic advantages as a detector material compared to InGaAs.

The (6,5)SWCNTs are characterized by an emission 
peak at 1000 nm with a fullwidth half maximum (FWHM) of around 30 nm. This emission lies precisely at the 
spectral boundary where the sensitivity of the silicon (Si) detectors ends (300 nm  1100 nm) and the sensitivity 
of InGaAs detectors (900 nm  1700 nm) begins. In most studies utilizing the fluorescence of (6,5)SWCNT for 
biosensing, singlepixel InGaAs photodiodes2431 or InGaAs cameras17,32,33,23 are used for detection. However, 
silicon offers intrinsic advantages compared to InGaAs as a detector material. Due to the lower bandgap of InGaAs, 
thermal noise is more prevalent in InGaAs detectors.34,35 Additionally, blackbody radiation becomes a non
neglectable factor at higher wavelengths.
