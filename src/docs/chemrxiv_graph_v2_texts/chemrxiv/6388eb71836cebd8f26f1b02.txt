Description:
A gas with significant uptake capacity in the Fe(pz)M(CN)4 series.

These can undergo a spinstate switch under the influence
of external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, light or
incorporation of guest molecules. The presence of unsatu
rated metal centers can, potentially, enhance the adsorption
capacity, 19 whereas their bistability can be used for sensing
applications. Several studies of gas adsorption have been
published 2026 since their discovery in 2001, 18 including
the interplay between spincrossover and guest molecules. Recently, the member of the series Fe(pz)M(CN)4 with
M  Pt(II) has shown a significant higher CO2 and CO
uptake capacities compared to other MOFs with larger sur
face areas. 27 In this work, we focus our interest in these
Hofmannlike clathrates upon CO2 and CO loading.

Description:
A gas that is adsorbed in Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4 at specific sites.

Text:
We
report a detailed study of gas adsorption mechanism of CO
and CO2 in Fe(pz)Pt(CN)4 in the lowspin state by means
of neutron scattering techniques and densityfunctional the
ory calculations. We identified the two adsorption sites, on
top of the openmetal site and between the pyrazine rings,
and the most stable orientational configuration of the guest
molecules and the pyrazine ligands of the framework was
determined. The inelastic neutron scattering results as
sisted by DFT calculations, show signatures of a hindrance
of the pyrazine libration and the outofplane movement of
cyanide ligands when the gas is adsorbed. Together with the
computed binding energy and a molecular orbital analysis,
these results agree with a physisorption mechanism for both
gases.
