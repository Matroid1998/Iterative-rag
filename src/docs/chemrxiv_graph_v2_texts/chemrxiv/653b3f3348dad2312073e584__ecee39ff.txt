Scope 
Aspirin is used for a variety of reasons, from reducing fever to providing relief for mild pain associated with 
headaches, menstrual cramps, and arthritis (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Its versatility leads to 
aspirin tablets being present in almost every home, which makes the consequences of their mishandling that much 
more impactful. Generally, patients are instructed not to store aspirin in areas exposed to excess heat and humidity as 
they cause aspirin to break down into salicylic acid and acetic acid (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Salicylic acid is the substance responsible for aspirins medicinal properties, and fluctuations in its concentration can 
lead to dosage inaccuracies. This leads to questions and concerns about the correlation between temperature and the 
concentration of salicylic acid within hydrolyzed aspirin.
