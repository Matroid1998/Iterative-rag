Description:
A gas released during cell formation and cycling in batteries.

Text:
Gas formation in LIBs and SIBs typically occurs during 
cell formation (SEI formation) where larger amounts of gases such as CO, CO2 or C2H2 
are released 4,7. Gas can also be released during cycling of the battery. In this case, gas 
formation typically indicates undesired side reactions due to e.g. overcharging or 
overdischarging which can cause decomposition of the electrolyte andor the electrode 
materials. Even a very minor gas release can be taken as sign for a continuous cell 
degradation which limits cycle life. In order to improve battery performance, detecting
