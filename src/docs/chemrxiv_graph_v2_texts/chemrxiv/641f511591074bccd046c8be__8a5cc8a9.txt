Description:
A material included in the category of ionic liquids and coordination polymers.

Text:
These materials include ionic liquids, polybenzimidazol, polysu
fones, covalent organic frameworks, coordination polymers, and metal organic
frameworks 621. Despite their promise, these membranes face practical chal
lenges and are not currently used in PEMFCs. We propose the use of a
membrane constructed from graphanol, shown in Figure 1a, which is a 2D
proton conducting material that can be incorporated in a PEMFC, as illus
trated in Figure 1b. Graphanol is the hydroxyl functionalized form of graphane
(sp3 hydrogentated version of graphene). Computational studies have shown
that functionalized graphane has higher predicted proton conductivity under
anhydrous conditions compared to other materials 22. Bagusetty et al. 2325 used density functional theory (DFT) to the
oretically investigate PT in graphanol and graphamine (amine functional
ized graphane).
