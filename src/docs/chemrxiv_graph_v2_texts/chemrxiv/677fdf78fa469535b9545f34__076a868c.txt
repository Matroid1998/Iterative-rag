Description:
Known as MXene, it is a 2D material with high electrical conductivity and photothermal conversion efficiency.

Starting with 
graphene, 2D materials have exhibited great potential as stimuliresponsive soft materials due to their large 
surfacetovolume ratio, mechanical flexibility, and extraordinary electrical and thermal properties, as well 
as their capacity to transduce diverse external stimuli into functional responses.7 
Among 2D materials, the transition metal carbide (TMC, also known as MXene), particularly Ti3C2Tx, has 
emerged as a promising candidate. Ti3C2Tx exhibits high electrical conductivity due to its metallic nature 
and high density of free electrons, which positively correlates with its photothermal conversion 
efficiency.8,9 Proofofconcept Ti3C2Tx actuators have demonstrated rapid lightresponsiveness, particularly 
in the nearinfrared region, and strong force actuation.3,1013 The conductivity of Ti3C2Tx is significantly 
influenced by their surface terminations (Tx), which are determined by synthesis and postprocessing 
methods.
