On the other hand, MXenes, another family of 2D nanomaterials, has emerged as a 
candidate for Liion storage. MXenes, Mn1XnTx, are derived from Mn1AXn 
precursors (termed MAX), where n  14, M is an early transition metal (Ti, V, Mo, 
Ta, Nb, etc), A is an element of the group IIIA or IVA (e.g. Al, Ga, Si, Ge, etc), X is 
C andor N and Tx describes surface chemical functionalities (O, F, OH, Cl).9, 10 
Particularly, Ti3C2Tx has been investigated in the context of LIB anode 
applications.1113 It stores Li in a 30.01 V vs LiLi electrochemical window and 
theoretically predicted capacities are 320449 mAh g1 for Ti3C2Li2.14, 15 However, its
