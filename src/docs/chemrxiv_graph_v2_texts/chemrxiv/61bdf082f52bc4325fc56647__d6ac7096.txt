Description:
Studied in the context of prebiotic astrochemistry.

For a wideranging and authoritative review of prebiotic astrochemistry and the formation
of molecules of astrobiological interest in interstellar clouds and protostellar disks see Sand
ford et al.11 A comprehensive study of peptidelike bond molecules, the GUAPOS project,
focussed on HNCO, HC(O)NH2, CH3NCO, CH3C(O)NH2, CH3NHCHO, CH3CH2NCO,
NH2C(O)NH2, NH2C(O)CN and HOCH2C(O)NH2 towards the hot core G31.410.31, con
cluding that the rst ve of these species which were detected are formed on grain surfaces
and later released to the gasphase by either thermal or shocktriggered desorption.12
Frigge et al. have calculated adiabatic ionisation energies of a number of C2H5NO isomers
in a vacuum ultraviolet photoionisation study of the formation of Nmethyl formamide in
deep space.13 But there has not been a comparable study to that of Gronowski et al.
