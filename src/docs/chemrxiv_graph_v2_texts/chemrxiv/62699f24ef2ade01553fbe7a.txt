Text:
Particularly, since 2016 the organic compound 2,4,5,6tetra(9Hcarbazol9
yl)isophthalonitrile, 4CzIPN, (Figure 1a) has become a popular choice as a 
photocatalyst.810 First developed as an emitter for organic lightemitting diodes 
(OLEDs),11 this compound possesses remarkably similar photophysical properties to 
the 
commonly 
used 
Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6 (dF(CF3)ppy)
