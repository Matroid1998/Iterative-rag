Important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Isoquinolines represent important structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Apart from forming 
the foundation of various medicines, isoquinoline and its derivatives play an important role in 
material science, functional material, chiral ligands, natural products, dyes, paints, etc.1 Among 
the many known isoquinoline derivatives, aminated isoquinolines are of utmost importance 
owing to their ubiquity in pharmaceuticals, therefore, considerable attention has long been paid 
to their development (Figure 1).2
