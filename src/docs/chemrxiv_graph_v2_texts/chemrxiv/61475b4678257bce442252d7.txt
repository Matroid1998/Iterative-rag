Forms hydrogen bonds, which are significant in the structure and energy of microhydrates.

It is rewarding that there are numerous rotational spectroscopy
studies of monohydrates with more or less direct structural and sometimes relative energy in
formation available in the literature5,911. These provide a lot of detail on the shallow potential
energy landscapes of solvation phenomena. A currently underexplored proxy to the hydrogen bond structure and energy of microhy
drates is the wavenumber of the hydrogenbonded OH stretching vibration OHb of any docking
water serving as a hydrogen bond donor12. As a single number for a given monohydrate complex
which can be derived from vibrational spectroscopy in a straightforward way, it oers a set of
advantages over more demanding structural studies.

Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds, which are characterized by the vibrational fingerprint of the OH group.

Text:
For multifunctional substrates, linear IR
and Raman spectroscopy can provide an immediate survey over competing hydrogen bond dock
ing sites due to the simplicity and intensity of the vibrational ngerprint of the OH group13,14. Double resonance techniques allow for rigorous size and conformational distinction15, relaxation
experiments can identify the most stable conformation16, and 18O labelling of water can un
ambiguously discriminate from other hydride stretching modes in the vicinity17. The spectral
position of the OH stretching vibration is very sensitive to the strength of the hydrogen bond,
spanning about two orders of magnitude in relation to the typical spectral width of an isolated
vibrational transition.
