Description:
A metal whose defects in quantum dot shells can be eliminated through extra purification steps.

InP QDs have risen to a place of prominence and competitiveness especially as 
bright and stable emitters for display and LED technologies.57 Recent innovations in InPbased QD 
emitters have incorporated strategies such as surface oxide removal by HF treatment prior to shelling with 
a wider band gap material6,8, elimination of indium defects in the shell through extra purification steps 
prior to shell growth7, and careful engineering of coreshell band alignment through tuning the core size 
and shell thickness3,5,9 or the composition of the core, the inner shell, and the outer shell layers.1013
