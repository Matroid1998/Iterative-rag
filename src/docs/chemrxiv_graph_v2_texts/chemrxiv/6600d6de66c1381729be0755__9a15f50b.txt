A biodegradable material with notable piezoelectric properties used in biomedical applications.

Text:
PolyLLactic Acid (PLLA) has attracted significant 
attention in the field of biomaterials due to its 
biodegradability 
and 
notable 
piezoelectric 
properties, 
positioning it as a promising candidate for diverse 
biomedical applications, including the development of 
biodegradable piezoelectric sensors. Notable studies within 
this domain have highlighted PLLAs potential in sensor 
fabrication. Here, Yousry, Y.M. et al. Developed a Shear 
Mode Ultrasonic Transducers derived from Flexible 
Piezoelectric PLLA Fibers for Structural Health Monitoring 
1. This research exemplifies PLLAs capacity for creating 
flexible and biocompatible sensors tailored for structural 
integrity assessment. Additionally, Curry, E.J., et al. contributed to this field by developing a Biodegradable 
Piezoelectric Force Sensor based on PLLA 2. Their study 
further underscores PLLAs versatility in the fabrication of 
biocompatible sensors capable of measuring mechanical 
forces in biomedical contexts.

Understanding the relationship between mechanical 
treatments and PLLAs piezoelectric behavior is crucial for 
the development of advanced biomedical devices with 
improved performance and longevity. By elucidating the 
structural changes underlying PLLAs piezoelectric response, 
this study contributes to the optimization of PLLAbased 
materials for applications ranging from tissue engineering to 
biomedical sensors. II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
PolyLLactic Acid (PLLA) granules, PURASORB PL 24 
from Corbion, were dried overnight at 80C before use. Chloroform served as the solvent for PLLA dissolution. For 
PLLA film preparation, 10 grams of PLLA granules were 
dissolved in 50 grams of chloroform and stirred for 8 hours 
at room temperature. The solution was refrigerated 
overnight. While cold, the solution was poured into a Petri 
dish, the solution was airdried overnight.
