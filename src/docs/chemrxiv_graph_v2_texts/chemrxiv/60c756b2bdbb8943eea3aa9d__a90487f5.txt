Description:
Used to study whole body amino acid metabolism.

For example, L13C6,15N4 arginine was used to inves
tigate autophagy and melanoma growth16. L113C, 15N leucine 
was used to study the whole body amino acid metabolism.17 Me
thyl2H313Cmethionine was used to study protein methylation 
and breakdown18. In these applications, the biological interpreta
tion of the results dependents on the accurate determination of the 
isotopic tracer incorporation in the metabolites. It should be noted that the measured mass isotopologue distribu
tion does not directly indicate the tracer incorporation. This is be
cause of the natural abundance (NA) of isotopes. For example, the 
unlabeled metabolite NAD (C21H27N7O14P2) would have 19 be
ing M1 because of the NA of 13C. Furthermore, 2.8 of unlabeled 
NAD could be M2 because of the NA of 18O.
