Description:
A compound studied in the 1950s for its role in molecular magnetism.

Text:
Polymetallic complexes of CuII represented the gateway to the field of molecular magnetism, beginning with 
studies of copper acetate1 in the 1950s through to the development of magnetostructural correlations in 
hydroxide and halidebridged dimers in the 1970s and 80s.2 Later research revealed the presence of spin 
frustration in equilateral CuII triangles and prompted detailed studies into the mechanisms of magnetic 
exchange.3 Indeed, high symmetry molecules are often ideal model complexes to examine geometric spin
frustration, and for larger nuclearity cages this can lead to some exotic behaviour including enhanced ground
state degeneracy, lowlying singlets, noncollinear ground states and unusual magnetisation 
plateausjumps.4 The synthesis of high symmetry molecules is however not trivial.5 One approach is to build 
small nuclearity, high symmetry complexes such as triangles or squares, since these are the building blocks 
of certain Archimedean and Platonic (or Keplerate) polyhedra, and assemble them into larger species often 
at high temperatures and pressures.6 An additional challenge comes in designing an organic ligand capable 
of stabilising such building blocks, and an excellent candidate is ptertbutylthiacalix4arene (H4TC4A, Fig.
