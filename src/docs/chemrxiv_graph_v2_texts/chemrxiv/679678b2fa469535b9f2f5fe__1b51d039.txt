Description:
Theoretically proposed to exist in the system, but not yet confirmed experimentally.

Text:
Furthermore, it has been theoretically proposed that Li3PSe4 may exist in the system, but
this has yet to be confirmed experimentally.10
The energetic hypersurface of existing structures can be explored through a combination
of quantum chemical energy calculations and search algorithms like Monte Carlo or
genetic algorithm.1113 Such structure prediction techniques provide insights into the
stability of different crystalline phases by probing the convex hull of all known and
hypothesized crystalline structures. Moreover, they allow identification of competing
structures for a given composition and estimations of their relative formation energies. The purpose of this study is to determine the structure and properties of Li4P2Se6 and to
relate them to other crystalline phases within the LiPSe system. 223
