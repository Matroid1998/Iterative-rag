Description:
Used in large amounts in the methods of Pin Xu et al.

Text:
Similarly, the method of Adam J. S. J. el al uses noble metal contained catalyst cataCXium APd
G3, and needs high temperature too30. The methods of Pin Xu et al uses formamid and large amount of hydrochloric acid. Formamid is 
hygroscopic, flammable and can strongly corrode copper, brass, lead and rubber31. Coupling of OAcyl Oximes with Isatins to generate 
quinoline4carboxamides needs high temperature and the use of toxic solvent toluene32. Therefore, it is essential to explore facile, effective, 
and green synthetic methods for these unique compounds that have several potential applications in diverse fields of interest.
