Description:
A redox protein often immobilized onto material substrates, with redox capabilities potentially affected by its environment.

The employment of redox proteins, such as Cyt c, frequently necessitates immobilisation onto a 
material substrate. Nanomaterials, due to their extensive potential for applications across diverse 
fields, several of which intersect with those of Cyt c, are increasingly drawing the attention of the 
scientific community. Thus, the incidence of Cyt c immobilisation on nanomaterials is not an 
infrequent activity 912. However, while immobilisation is often reported, there is a discernible 
lack of discussion surrounding the potential implications that this environment may have on the 
redox capabilities of Cyt c. It is crucial to investigate this domain, as alterations in redox 
functionality could critically affect the proteins applicability in various use cases.
