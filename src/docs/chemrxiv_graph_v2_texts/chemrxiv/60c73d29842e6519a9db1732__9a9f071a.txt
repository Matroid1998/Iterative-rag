Glycoscience is an important emerging area with potential applications from personalized 
medicines and food security, to biofuels and advanced biomaterials.2 Key to the rational design 
of carbohydratebased compounds is the ability to accurately understand their conformational 
behavior.3 Achieving this, however, can be challenging as carbohydrates can exhibit subtle 
conformational preferences. In this regard, the use of computational methods have proven useful; 
in particular, the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is capable of providing 
conformational landscapes in atomistic detail not readily accessible via experimental approaches. For example, conformational analysis of the core pentasaccharide derived from the 
lipooligosaccharide of pathogenic bacterium Moraxella catarrhalis was recently performed 
using molecular simulation and NMR.

Description:
A core structure whose conformation changes with the addition of glucosyl units.

Text:
It was shown that the addition of one glucosyl unit to each 
of the (14) and (12) branches of this core pentasaccharide led to a significant change in 
conformation, into a more folded compact structure,4 with significant potential implications for 
the minimum epitope to target in vaccine design. In another recent study, Blaum et al.5 examined the pentasaccharide glycan component of 
ganglioside GM1, a membranebound ligand for a range of proteins, including those of viruses 
and bacteria. In their work, they identified an alternative conformation of GM1, exhibited in its 
complex with a 155 kDa protein, Factor H. Subsequent long time scale MD simulations (10 s) 
of GM1 in explicit solvent identified this structure as a secondary lowlying minimum on the 
free energy surface.
