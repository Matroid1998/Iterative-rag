Description:
Materials with a nanoporous structure used as shape-selective catalysts and separation materials.

Text:
Zeolites are aluminosilicate materials whose nanoporous 
structure leads to wide application as shapeselective catalysts, 
catalytic supports and separation materials across multiple 
chemical industry sectors. 1,2 Catalytic activity occurs at either 
incorporated metal centres3 or at framework Brnsted acid 
sites in the case of protonated zeolites.1 These applications 
depend on the complex geometric and chemical properties of 
the zeolite pore network, dictating how molecules adsorb into 
and diffuse through the material. Studying the chemistry and 
interactions of molecules in zeolites on timescales relevant to 
their diffusion and reaction is critical for developing an 
improved understanding of the many mechanisms of catalysis 
in these important materials.
