Description:
A rigid linear linker essential for high affinity binding to Keap1 at the Nrf2 site.

of highly reactive hypervalent iodine reagents  ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBXs) 
onto peptides. These peptideEBXs can be easily accessed, both via solution and solid phase 
peptide synthesis (SPPS). They can be used to couple the peptide to other peptides or a protein 
via reaction with cysteine, leading to thioalkynes in organic solvents and hypervalent iodine 
adducts in water buffer. In addition, a photocatalytic decarboxylative coupling to the C
terminus of peptides was developed using an organic dye. This later reaction was also 
successful in an intramolecular way, leading to macrocyclic peptides of an unprecedented 
shape. The rigid linear aryl alkyne linker was essential to achieve high affinity to Keap1 at the 
Nrf2 binding site with potential proteinprotein interaction inhibition.
