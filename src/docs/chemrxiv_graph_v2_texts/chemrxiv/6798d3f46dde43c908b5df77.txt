Furthermore, cathodic proton reduction leads the formation of 
hydrogen gas a key energy resource for a decarbonized economy.6 Distinct strategies were 
established for the generation of CN atropoisomers by electrocatalytic CH activation. Hence, 
enantioselective CH olefinations through oxidative palladium electrocatalysis were accomplished.7 
Furthermore, atropoenantioselective CH annulations were shown to be viable by cobalt

electrocatalysis (Scheme 1A).8 The versatility was emphasized by the diastereo and enantioselective 
synthesis of dihydroisoquinolinones featuring both CN axial and Ccentral chirality (Scheme 1A).9
