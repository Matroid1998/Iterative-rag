Description:
A material used in proton exchange membranes that requires hydration to function effectively.

Text:
The importance of proton transport can be seen in the significant advance
ments made in hydrogen fuel cell technology. One of the most successful fuel
cell types, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), has been com
mercialized for use in both residential 1 and transportation applications 2. This success is due in part to the highpower density and efficiency of PEM
FCs. Almost all commercial PEMFCs employ a Nafionbased proton exchange
membrane 3. However, Nafion membranes require appropriate hydration to
operate because Nafion is not an intrinsic proton conducting material.
