Description:
Comprising six, seven, or eight glucose monomers in the shape of a hollow, truncated cone.

Text:
Cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides, comprising six (CD), seven (CD) or eight (CD) glucose 
monomers in the shape of a hollow, truncated cone (Figure 1). Their C6 primary hydroxyls rim the 
narrower face of the cone, while their C2 and C3 secondary hydroxyls are located on the wider face (Figure 
1). The hydroxyls make the exterior of cyclodextrin hydrophilic and contribute to its aqueous solubility, 
while the internal cavity remains hydrophobic, allowing for noncovalent association with lipophilic and 
amphiphilic molecules. The cyclodextrins have found practical applications, such as solubilization of small, 
lipophilic, drug molecules1,2, and encapsulation of volatile compounds3,4. Cyclodextrins also have been 
adopted as test cases for computational methods of predicting noncovalent binding affinities.
