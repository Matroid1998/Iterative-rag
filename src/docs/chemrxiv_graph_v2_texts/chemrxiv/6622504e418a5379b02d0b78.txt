Description:
Forms a site comprised of three conserved amino acids in the catalytic domain of phosphoethanolamine transferases.

Text:
Phosphoethanolamine transferases, including MCR, are enzymes of the Gramnegative inner 
membrane that consist a soluble periplasmic catalytic and a transmembrane domain14 (Figure 1). The 
catalytic domain has been the subject of relatively extensive biochemical study1517 and contains a zinc 
site (Zn1, comprised of three conserved amino acids, Glu246, Asp 465 and His466) adjacent to the 
threonine residue (Thr285) that is the likely site of formation of the covalent phosphointermediate 
formed when PEtN is transferred from a phosphatidyl ethanolamine donor to the lipid A acceptor 
substrate (Scheme 1). Two additional conserved gating histidine residues (His395 and His478) are 
observed in some structures15 to bind a second zinc equivalent (Zn2), but the physiological and 
mechanistic significance of this site remains unclear.
