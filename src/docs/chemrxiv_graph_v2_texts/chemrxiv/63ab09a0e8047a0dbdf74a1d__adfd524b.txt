Description:
Exhibits outstanding catalytic activity in the temperature window of 300-400Â°C.

Yet, both theory and experiment agree
that a proper amount of tungsten stabilizes the anatase phase of the TiO2 support thus
extending the operation time of the catalyst with a high activity.7,8 Still, although tungsta
vanadia catalysts exhibit an outstanding catalytic activity in the temperature window of
300400C, the low NO conversion rate at lower temperatures and the poor selectivity at
high temperatures are still challenging issues. Therefore, numerous eorts have focused on
the widening of the operation temperature range of SCR catalysts, which is closely related
to adjusting the redox properties and the acidity of catalysts.911
Among various possibilities, introducing new doping elements is one of the most promising
