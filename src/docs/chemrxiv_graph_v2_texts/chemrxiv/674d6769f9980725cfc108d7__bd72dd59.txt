Description:
Used in three-component Suzuki reactions with aryl halide and alkyne to afford axially chiral olefins.

Text:
In prior studies, a sterically hindered but reactive aryl halide has been typically employed toward 
de novo construction of axially chiral biaryls (Scheme 1a). Early studies took advantage of the 
Suzuki reactions for atroposelective synthesis of CC biaryls.5a,10 The Song group11 further 
developed threecomponent Suzuki reactions between aryl halide, alkyne, and aryl boronic acid, 
affording axially chiral olefins. The same group also extended the reaction pattern to CB axially 
chiral products via a Miyaura reaction.12 By retorting to amidetethered isocyanide as a reactive 
coupling reagent, the Zhu group13 realized Pdcatalyzed atroposelective synthesis of 
diarylquinazolinone via CC coupling. The Taguchi14 group and our group15 addressed 
atroposelective synthesis of CN biaryls via BuchwaldHartwig coupling of two sterically hindered 
substrates.
