Description:
A nanomaterial synthesized using chitosan biopolymers as templates, supports, or substrates.

Text:
Chitosan biopolymers can be used as 
effective templates, supports, or substrates to synthesize several nanomaterials, including photocatalysts 41, 
magnetic nanoparticles 4244, molybdenum vanadate45, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)4648, and graphene 
oxide (CTS) 49. Chitosanbased materials enable several applications, e.g., separation, photocatalysis, biotech
nology, and biosensing applications 39,5053. Quantum dots (QDs) or semiconductor nanocrystals (SNCs) exhibited unique optical and electronic 
properties, making them distinct from other nanomaterials 5466. QDs show good luminescence properties 
compared to organic and inorganic nanoparticles45,6771. The emission wavelength of QDs can be modified via 
the changing in QDs particle size or by selecting a suitable light source for excitation 7276. QDs exhibit a 
narrow, tunable, and symmetric emission spectrum compared to organic fluorophores 77,78. However, QDs 
with small capping agents tend to aggregate or agglomerate.
