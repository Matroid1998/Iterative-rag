Description:
Compounds that can form zwitterions with simultaneous positive and negative charges.

Redoxactive organic molecules are used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from energy 
storage, use as photochemical sensitizers, as homogeneous (electro)catalysts, and in biomedical 
applications.16 The generation of charged organic molecules facilitates their solubility in aqueous 
and nonaqueous solvents. We are particularly interested in boron compounds. The generation of 

boroncontaining zwitterions,7, 8 where the organic compound carry simultaneously positive and 
negative charges within their structure make them of great interest for their solubility. In the last 
decade, boron fluoride adducts of Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) were reported.
