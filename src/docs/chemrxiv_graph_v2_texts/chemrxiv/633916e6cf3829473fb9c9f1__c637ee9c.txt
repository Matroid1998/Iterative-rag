Description:
Used as an anode material in current lithium-ion batteries.

Developing batteries with higher energy densities is vital for electric transportation and a renewable
powered electric grid.1 Replacing graphite anode (in current lithiumion batteries) with lithium metal can 
at least double the overall battery gravimetric energy density.2 Hence, there has been fervent research to 
develop rechargeable lithium metal batteries.
