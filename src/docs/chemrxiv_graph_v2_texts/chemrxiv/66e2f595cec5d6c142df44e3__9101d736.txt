Description:
Has a detrimental contribution to the catalytic activities in selective oxidation of 2propanol on mesoporous Co3O4.

activity of the nanosheets. Similarly, the substitution
of Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu and Ni into octahedral sites and
the impact on the selective oxidation of 2propanol on
mesoporous Co3O4 was investigated by Falk et al.13 The
systematic study revealed the detrimental and beneficial
contributions to the catalytic activities of Cr, Mn, Fe
and Cu, Ni, respectively.
