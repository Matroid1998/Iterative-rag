Description:
Acts as a reducible oxide support with the capacity to form oxygen vacancies that enhance reactivity.

Text:
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has emerged as a critical support material for catalysts due 
to its exceptional physical and chemical properties, including high stability, tunable 
electronic characteristics, and the capacity to form oxygen vacancies1. These oxygen 
vacancies, particularly on the TiO2 surface, play a pivotal role in catalytic processes 
by enhancing reactivity and enabling TiO2 to act as a reducible oxide support2. Manipulating these vacancies is crucial in catalytic applications such as CO2 activation 
and reduction within the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction and 
(de)hydrogenation reactions, where modifying surface structures can significantly 
improve catalytic performance35. Among the different phases of TiO2, the rutile form has been extensively studied, 
especially under reductive conditions, where surface reconstructions occur.

Description:
Has a strong ionic character and significant long-range interactions.

Text:
Both 
experimental studies and theoretical simulations, such as density functional theory 
(DFT) calculations, have identified many stable surface terminations 68. However, 
capturing the full range of surface configurations remains computationally challenging 
due to the vast number of possible structures that need to be sampled. The primary 
challenge lies in identifying nontrivial, complex surface reconstructions that 
significantly influence the materials catalytic behavior. To address the limitations of DFTs high computational cost, machinelearning 
interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become valuable tools912. When trained on high
fidelity DFT data, MLIPs can efficiently explore large configurational spaces while 
maintaining DFTlevel accuracy13. However, developing an efficient MLIP that 
captures the complex behavior of reduced TiO2 surfaces is difficult, especially due to 
TiO2s strong ionic character and the significant longrange interactions involved.
