However, PMs often 
suffer from intrinsic issues such as low drug loading, instability 11 and poor permeability 
across cell membranes or other biological barriers 12. The loading capacity (LC) and stability 
can directly be correlated to intrinsic properties of polymers, drugs orand their compatibility 
with each other 13. In the past decades, poly(2oxazoline)s (POx) and poly(2oxazine)s (POzi) 
have gained significant attention for their biomedical and pharmaceutical applications 14
16. Unlike many other systems, the POxPOzi based ABA triblock copolymer (A and B, 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic block, respectively) have shown particular potential for 
development of ultrahigh drug loaded micellar formulations 14.
