Description:
Can be reduced to produce graphene.

Text:
Industries are planning to add graphene in products such
38
as tires, concrete, and asphalt to enhance their properties, which are currently hot
39
areas of commercial investment in graphene.7 Costeffective mass production is
40
crucial for achieving the largescale industrial application of graphene.8 However,
41
traditional graphene production methods, such as chemical vapor deposition,9
42
reduction of graphene oxide,10 and graphite exfoliation,1113 are complex and
43
timeconsuming, resulting in high costs.
