Description:
A polyanion found in the two-dimensional tin network of NaSn2.

Text:
Hence, twodimensional tin networks are found for the phases Na7Sn12 14 and NaSn2 
15 featuring the polyanions 2
Sn127 and 2
Sn84, respectively, which are separated by layers 
of sodium cations. Finally, a threedimensional tin network is found in Na5Sn13 16 with open 
tunnel structure, and in the Sn richest phase NaSn5 17 with both  and Sn structural motif in 
which the Na atoms are located in cages with the shape deriving from a pentagonal
dedocahedron. Localized 2e2c bonds are predominant in the formally Zintl phases NaSn, 18
