Description:
A precious metal used in synthetic organic chemistry for cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Nickelcatalyzed crosscouplings have emerged as 
broadly useful methodologies in synthetic organic chemis
tryin large part due to the complementary reactivity of Ni 
to precious metals like Pd.1,2 In addition to Nis ability to fa
cilitate challenging oxidative addition reactions,3,4 its rela
tive propensity5 to access openshell electron configura
tions (i.e., NiI  NiIII) underlies many modern crosscoupling 
reactions (e.g., Niphotoredox,6 Nielectrocatalysis,7 cross
electrophile coupling8). Conversely, this same property can 
attenuate turnover in traditional Ni0NiII cycles, where NiI 
species have been identified as offcycle.9 It is therefore of 
great interest to understand the nuanced factors that con
trol the formation, reactivity, and speciation of NiI interme
diates.10,11 
Stoichiometric synthesis of welldefined NiI complexes 
presents an opportunity to investigate these nuances and 
characterize species that are relevant in catalysis.
