Description:
The 3-terminal CCA nucleotides are added during tRNA maturation.

Text:
Steps in 
translation that could be affected by these differences include tRNA maturation, in which the tRNA 
3terminal CCA nucleotides are added, tRNA aminoacylation, tRNA delivery to the ribosome 
during mRNA decoding, and finally peptide bond formation in the ribosomal active site, the 
peptidyl transferase center (PTC).8 
Many have theorized that thioesters may have played a key role in the origin of life,912 
wherein aminoacyl thioesters1315 could have generated oligomeric peptides with potential 
catalytic activity10, thereby acting as a link between the prebiotic and RNA world.16,17 Prebiotically 
plausible synthetic routes to nucleosides with 2thiolmodified ribose have been identified and 
routes to 3thiolmodifications proposed, further strengthening the possibility that short 
sequences of modified RNAs could have acted as early amino acid transfer reagents as the first 
RNA protoribosomes evolved.9,13,15 Thus, despite modern peptidyl transfer in the ribosome using 
exclusively oxoesterlinked aminoacyltRNA, it is possible that thioesters rather than oxoesters 
acted as early intermediates in ribosomal peptide synthesis.18,19
