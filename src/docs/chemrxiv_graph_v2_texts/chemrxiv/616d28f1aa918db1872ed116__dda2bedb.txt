Description:
A versatile atom-efficient CO surrogate used in carbonylation reactions.

Text:
Carbonylation reactions constitute a potent tool to manufacture carboxylic acids and their 
derivatives both in industry and academic organic synthesis.17 In general, the proceeding of 
carbonylation requires the use of toxic carbon monoxide, which thus usually demands certified 
high pressure reaction vessels.8 Therefore, developing nongaseous CO surrogate for 
conducting safe and facileoperation carbonylation with stoichiometric amount of CO in 
common Pyrex glass vessels (e.g., the twochamber reactor8 and sealed glass tube) is an 
important and ongoing research topic in the realm of homogenous catalysis.915 Among these 
established CO surrogates, formic acid and its derivatives is one kind of versatile atom
