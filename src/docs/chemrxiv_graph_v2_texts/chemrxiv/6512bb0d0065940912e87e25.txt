Description:
An Earth-abundant metal used in complexes to replace precious metals in photosensitisers.

Text:
Extensive research efforts have continuously been devoted to
develop efficient sensitisers absorbing in the visible range, with
the most important aspects being the price andor toxicity of the
metal and the lifetime of the relevant MLCT states3. An immense
achievement was made a decade ago towards replacing photosen
sitisers based on precious metals, such as Ru and Ir, by Earth
abundant Fe complexes. This breakthrough was obtained owing
to the utilisation of strongly donating Nheterocyclic carbene
(NHC) ligands46, which destabilise metalcentered (MC) excited
states7, that otherwise rapidly, in ca. 100 fs quench the MLCTs in
common Fe complexes such as Fe(II) polypyridines812.
