Synthesized via organocatalyzed enantioselective methods.

Text:
3,4Dimethyl ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in catalyst
free 33 annulationoxidation of cyclic amidines with activated olefins 1, and in NN
dioxideLanthanum(III)catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation of 2cyano3
arylacrylates with 2bromomalonates. 2. 3,4Dimethyl ringsubstituted tbutyl PCA is 
mentioned in development of the first twopore domain potassium channel twikrelated 
k channel 1selective agonist possessing in vivo antinociceptive activity 3. 3
Methoxyphenyl 1methylethyl ester (2E) PCA is reported in organocatalyzed 
enantioselective synthesis of 2amino4hchromene derivatives, and in organocatalyzed 
enantioselective synthesis of 2amino5oxo5,6,7,8tetrahydro4Hchromene3
carboxylates 4. 4Methoxy3methylphenyl ethyl PCA is mentioned in 
organocatalyzed enantioselective synthesis of 2amino5oxo5,6,7,8tetrahydro4H
chromene3carboxylates 5; in synthesis of potent, orally bioavailable pyrimidine5
carbonitrile6alkyl CXCR2 receptor antagonists 6, and in synthesis of 
methoxytolylsuccinic acids 7. 4Methoxy3(1methylethoxy)phenyl PCA is used in 
synthesis of 4benzyl2imidazolidinones from N(1cyano2phenyl)ethyl carbamates 
8.
