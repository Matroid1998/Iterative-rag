Description:
Acts as an external hydrogen donor in chemical processes.

While 
nucleophilic trapping has been used for the functionalization of styrene, the hydrotrifluoromethylation of 
styrene derivatives has been scarcely studied. This challenge has been addressed by Choi et al.7 who used 
inorganic electride as a radical generator (3 equivalents) in their procedure to achieve this transformation. More recently, the group of Nol8 used an iridium based photocatalyst in the presence of 4
hydroxythiophenol as an external hydrogen donor in batch or continuous flow. It should be mentioned 
that both procedures made use of gaseous trifluoromethyl iodide. Figure 1. Reactivity of fluoroalkyl radicals with styrene and scope of this study.
