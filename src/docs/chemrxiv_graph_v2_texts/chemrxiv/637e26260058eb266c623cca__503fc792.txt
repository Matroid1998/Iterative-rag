Description:
A suitable carbon source available from industrial exhaust gases.

26 
This requires a carbon source, for which both carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as 
27 
mixtures of both (COx), are suitable and available in sufficient amounts from industrial exhaust gases 2. 28 
The stoichiometric equations for the methanation of CO and CO2 are given in equations (1) and (2), 
29 
respectively, while equation (3) represents the water gas shift reaction  a linear combination of both 
30 
methanation reactions 3,4. 31
