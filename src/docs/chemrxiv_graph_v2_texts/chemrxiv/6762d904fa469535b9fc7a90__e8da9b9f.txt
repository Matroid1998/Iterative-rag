Description:
Hosts hydrogenase enzymes for unassisted fuel synthesis in biohybrid PEC devices.

Text:
Direct enzymatic electrochemistry is 
thus an appealing strategy for optimising electron transfer and maximising efficiency at the biotic
abiotic interface27,28 of biohybrid PEC devices. Here, we introduce the rational design of OPVs for sustainable and direct semiartificial 
photosynthesis, driving unassisted fuel synthesis for up to 1 day. To this end, BHJbased OPVs are 
interfaced with hierarchically nanostructured inverse opal TiO2 (IOTiO2) electrodes hosting NiFeSe
hydrogenase (H2ase) and Wformate dehydrogenase (FDH). The enzymes used in this study have
