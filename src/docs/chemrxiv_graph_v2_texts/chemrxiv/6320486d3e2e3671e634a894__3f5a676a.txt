Description:
Formed as a product in the reaction between epoxides and primary amines.

Text:
Epoxyresin thermosets are known for their tunable and superior thermomechanical properties,1
3 making them suitable for a range of technological applications. Most notably, epoxies are used 
as adhesives4 and coatings5 in the automotive industry, as well as matrix materials in various 
composites.6 Their thermomechanical properties are determined by their covalently crosslinked 
molecular structure, which forms during the socalled curing or crosslinking process. During the 
curing process, typically a (liquid) mixture of epoxy prepolymer and socalled hardener molecules 
reacts chemically to yield the final cured epoxy material. An example of such chemical reactions 
is shown in Scheme 1 for aminebased hardeners. For typical aminebased hardeners, the curing 
reaction proceeds via an addition reaction between an epoxide and a primary amine to give a 
hydroxyl group and a secondary amine.

Description:
Produced when a secondary amine reacts with an epoxy group.

Text:
This secondary amine can further react with another epoxy 
group to give a tertiary amine and another hydroxyl group. To obtain a sufficiently crosslinked 
resin, the epoxy prepolymer needs to contain at least two epoxide groups, which can react with at 
least two different amine moieties of the hardener. Scheme 1. Amine based curing reactions of epoxy resins. During curing, eventually, an amorphous molecular entity appears in the system, recognizable 
as an insoluble gel. It is suspended in the stillliquid part of the mixture, the sol, in which those 
polymers of lower molecular weights not yet attached to the gel are harbored.
