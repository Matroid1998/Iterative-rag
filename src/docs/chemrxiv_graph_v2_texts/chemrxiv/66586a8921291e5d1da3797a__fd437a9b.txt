Description:
Estimated to contain up to 10% of all galactic carbon.

Molecular composition in the interstellar medium (ISM) is rich so far, more than 300 molecular species have been
identified through their spectroscopic signatures.1 If we also include the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
which are estimated to contain up to 10 of all galactic carbon,2 the potential molecular variety grows even larger.
