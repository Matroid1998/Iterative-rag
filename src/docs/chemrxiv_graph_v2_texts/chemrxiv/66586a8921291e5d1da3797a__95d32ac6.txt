Description:
A Huckel-method based model was introduced for them.

In the case
of fragmentation, the availability of many possible pathways of fragmentation possibilities with various spincharge
states provides a very challenging chemical space to sample.5, 1822 Theoretical calculations may be done, for in
stance, using molecular dynamicsbased approaches,2326 reproducing some of the polycationic properties, such as
the kinetic energy release in fragmentation.27 Semiquantitative models are known to be useful for describing trends
of different processes.11, 2831 In particular, a model for polycation stability based on the Coulomb interaction
potential was proposed in Ref. 11, and for fullerenes, a Huckelmethod 32 based model was introduced in Ref. 31.
