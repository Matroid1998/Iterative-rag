Description:
A gas that can be separated from a mixture using electrochemical methods.

Text:
Additionally, the ease of scalability, plugandplay nature of operation, and lower regeneration 
temperature requirements not only promise seamless adoption but also contribute to reduced 
operational costs by mitigating concerns regarding solvent losses 19, 20. The evolving field of ECC can be categorized into four main branches depending on the 
mechanism they follow to separate CO2 from a gas mixture (1) electrochemical generation of 
nucleophiles (EGN) 2123, (2) electrochemical modulation of proton concentration (EMPC)
