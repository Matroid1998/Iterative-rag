Description:
Exhibits a sharp decrease in hardness due to structural transformations.

Text:
The
metastable fcc AlN domains further transform into a stable hexagonal close packed AlN wurtzite
phase with a pronounced volume increase of 24.28 These structural transformations cause a
sharp decrease in hardness of Ti1xAlxN22 as well as generation of microcracks which serve as
