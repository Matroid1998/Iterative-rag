Description:
Compounds that demonstrate excellent stability in water, organic solvents, and under different physiological conditions.

In this regard, several new 
reagents including commercially available ones have been reported.5 Given the high interest in SCF3 motif in organofluorine chemistry, 
the synthesis of easily accessible new reagents is highly desirable.6 
We have recently reported the robust and efficient onepot synthesis of unprecedented N(SCF3)(CF3) compounds from 
commercially available starting materials.7 Upon evaluating their stability, it turned out that compound I (Scheme 1) demonstrated 
excellent stability in water, organic solvents, and under different physiological conditions. However, this compound quickly degraded 
under basic conditions, raising the question of its ability to be a source of fluorinated motif. Thus, we disclose herein that PhPhN
(SCF3)(CF3) can be used to forge CSCF3 bond under mild visible light irradiation conditions by using an organophotocatalyst.8
