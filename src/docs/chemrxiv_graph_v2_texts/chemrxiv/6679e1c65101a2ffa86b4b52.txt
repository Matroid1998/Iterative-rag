Released from side reactions in lithium-ion batteries, contributing to structural instability and high-capacity fading.

As a cause of global 
warming, the automobile industry is transforming to electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric 
vehicles (HEVs) which are majorly powered by lithiumion batteries.4,5 Several research studies 
have been vigorously carried out to improve the energy density and safety of LIBs, especially 
focusing on electrode and electrolyte components.6,7 Out of other classes of cathode materials, the 
layered nickelrich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) material well performs in high operating 
voltage (4.5V) and delivers high discharge capacity.810 Nevertheless, these materials have some 
limitations such as poor rate capability and highcapacity fading11,12 due to structural instability, 
LiNi cation disordering, surface degradation, and release of oxygen from the side reactions.13,14 
To overcome these disadvantages, several techniques such as surface coating, metal doping, 
control of morphology, and composite formation have been developed.15,16 
Among all the techniques, surface coating can be an effective strategy to limit the 
degradation of the electrode surface during prolonged contact with the electrolyte and enhance 
ionic conductivity by forming a stable cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) which consequently 
improves the stability of the material.1720 Several studies have already been made by surface 
modification of cathodes and enhancing the electrochemical properties of LIBs.21,22 Carbon as a
