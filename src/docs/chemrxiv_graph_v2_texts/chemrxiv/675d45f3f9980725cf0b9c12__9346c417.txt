Description:
The most widely used bleaching agent in Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching sequences.

Bleached kraft pulp is produced for various enduses such as bleached packaging, 
wrappings, printing papers, smooth papers, or tissues. A common requirement for virgin 
kraft fibres is their high strength. The pulping, bleaching, and papermaking steps can alter 
the kraft fibres strength by mechanically and chemically introducing local defects (Mohlin  
Alfredson 1990, Hartler 1995, Mohlin et al. 1996, Palme et al. 2016). Bleaching is the chemical 
process of removing residual lignin from unbleached pulp by the successive use of strong 
oxidants and alkaline extraction stages. Chlorine dioxide is today the most widely used 
bleaching agent and commonly employed in Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching 
sequences. Its main drawback resides in the generation of bioaccumulable chlorinated 
organics in the bleach plant effluent.
