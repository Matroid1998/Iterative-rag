Description:
A matrix used in MALDI-MSI for negative-ion mode metabolite analysis.

Examples of MALDIMSI of metabolite distributions in cancer include glioblastoma17, 
thyroid cancer subtypes18, pancreatic ductul adenocarcinoma19 and breast cancer brain 
metastasis.20 
MALDIMSI of metabolites is typically performed in the negativeion mode using 
matrices 9aminoacridine (9AA), diaminonaphthalene (DAN) and N(1naphthyl) 
ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDC).21 However, analyte coverage is often limited by 
varied and often low ionisation efficiencies of analytes (as low as 109), an effect further 
compounded by the complex nature of biological samples leading to ion suppression effects. To help overcome this limitation and broaden the overall analyte coverage and sensitivity of 
MSI, postionisation (PI) techniques that enhance ionisation efficiencies by up to 2orders of 
magnitude have seen rapid development in recent years.
