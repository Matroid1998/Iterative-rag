Description:
Product generated from the activation of a CH bond in an alkane by zirconium hydrides.

Polymeric hydrocarbon waste is an abundant and inexpensive 
source of carbon for a future sustainable chemical industry.1 Chem
ical modification of polymeric hydrocarbons face similar chal
lenges to those encountered in the chemistry of light alkanes; these 
contain unpolarized sp3 hybridized CH and CC bonds that are 
thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert. Reactive catalysts 
are necessary to activate these unreactive bonds.2 An example is 
the mixture of low coordinate zirconium hydrides supported on sil
ica shown in Figure 1a.3 The ZrH sites activate a CH bond in an 
alkane by a sbond metathesis reaction4 that follows the 4centered 
transition state shown in Figure 1b to generate the organozirconium 
product.
