The allure of metalfree semiconductors with narrow bandgaps
has captured significant attention in recent decades, proving
exceptionally versatile for various electronic applications such
as infrared devices, lightemitting diodes, electrocatalysts, and
thermophotovoltaics. This interest has been further fueled by
the emergence of twodimensional nanomaterials in material sci
ence and engineering following the groundbreaking discovery of
graphene by a collaborative effort in the past decade14. Recently, a breakthrough occurred with the experimental realiza
tion of a singlecrystal 2D carbon material, termed monolayer
quasihexagonalphase fullerene (C60), boasting a semiconduct
ing bandgap of approximately 1.6 eV5. This achievement ad
dresses the issue of null bandgaps observed in other 2D carbon
based materials. Using an organic cation slicing strategy, re
searchers exfoliated quasihexagonal bulk single crystals to ob
tain monolayer polymeric C60.

Description:
Forms covalently bonded cluster cages within a plane, leading to stable quasihexagonal and quasitetragonal phases.

Text:
Using an interlayer bonding cleav
age strategy, they obtained largesized C60 2D crystals. These
crystals exhibit a unique structure where C60 polymers form co
valently bonded cluster cages within a plane. This clustering
mechanism led to the formation of two stable crystals, namely
closely packed quasihexagonal (qHP C60) and quasitetragonal
(qTP C60) phases5. Monolayer C60 distinguishes itself from other 2D materials due
to its larger surface area and increased active sites resulting from
the quasi0D network structures of C60 cages. It exhibits excel
lent thermodynamic stability and high carrier mobility, making
it a promising candidate for photocatalytic water splitting610. Obtaining monolayer polymeric C60 involved an organic cation
slicing strategy, yielding substantialsized C60 2D crystals with
