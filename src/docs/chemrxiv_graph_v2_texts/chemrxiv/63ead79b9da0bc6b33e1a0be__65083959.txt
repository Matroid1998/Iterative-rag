Description:
The first corrosion species formed upon exposure of bare aluminum to the atmosphere, more stable than the pure metal beneath it.

Aluminum and its alloys are lightweight metals used in a wide range of applications, but
are susceptible to corrosion under a variety of conditions.13 Corrosion of aluminum occurs
even under standard atmospheric conditions and manifests in the form of metal oxide growth
and localized surface pitting, with kinetics that increase with increasing temperature and
pH,48 as well as relative humidity (RH)9 and concentrations of dissolved oxygen gas.8 The
first corrosion species formed upon exposure of bare aluminum to the atmosphere is 
alumina, which readily forms in presence of both O2 gas10,11 and moisture.3,6 This oxide
layer is more stable than the pure metal beneath it and reduces the rate of subsequent
corrosion.1215 Subsequent formation of corrosion pits on the surface typically occurs due
to absorption of antagonists such as halides14 within the metal oxide layer.
