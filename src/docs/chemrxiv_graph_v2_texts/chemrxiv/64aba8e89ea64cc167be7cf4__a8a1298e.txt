Description:
A compound with six accessible valence states.

Text:
There 
are, nevertheless, a few exceptions like the RuII(2,6bis(phenylazo)pyridine)3(PF62 15 showing four 
accessible valence states, Cr(L3)3 with six accessible valence states 16 or polyoxometalates (POMs)  
multinuclear early transition metal systems such as Li6P2W18O62 17 or NBu44S2W18O62 18,19 (NBu4  
tetrabutylammonium cation), which can accommodate multiple electrons in a series of multiple 
reversible reduction reactions (Figure 1A and 1B). These systems, however, are relatively large, e.g., 
the molar mass of the redox active species S2W18O62n exceeds 4000 gmol1. Moreover, S2W18O62n 
could only be characterized structurally in two valence states with n  4 and 5. 20 The situation for its 
Moanalog is similar only three valence states with n  4, 5 and 6 2123 are reported according to the 
CCDC database.
