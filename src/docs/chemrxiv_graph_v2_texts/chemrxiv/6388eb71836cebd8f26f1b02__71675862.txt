Description:
A gas with a strong impact on the greenhouse effect.

Text:
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid and crystalline
materials composed of metal centers connected by organic
ligands. The resulting 3D frameworks exhibit ultrahigh
porosity and large surface areas that can be modulated for
specific applications due to the wide availability of metal
ligand combinations. For this reason, MOFs have been
extensively studied for applications in many different fields
of science such as catalysis, 14 drug delivery 5 or gas adsorp
tion, 6,7 separation, 8,9 sensing 4,1012 and storage, 8,13 among
others. One of the applications that has attracted the most
attention in recent years is the capture of polluting gases
emitted from anthropogenic sources. Special attention has
been paid to carbon dioxide due to its strong impact on the
greenhouse effect.
