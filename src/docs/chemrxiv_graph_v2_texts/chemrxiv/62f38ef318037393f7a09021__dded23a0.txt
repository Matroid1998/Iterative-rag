Description:
An amino acid residue that selectively adds onto the alkynyl bond of ethynylbenziodoxolones.

of hypervalent iodine onto biomolecules under physiological conditions. Tyrosine residues were engaged in 
a selective addition onto the alkynyl bond of ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBX), resulting in stable vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) bioconjugates. The methodology 
was successfully applied to peptides and proteins and tolerated all other nucleophilic residues, with the exception of cysteine. The generated VBX were further 
functionalized by palladiumcatalyzed crosscoupling and azidealkyne cycloaddition reactions. The method could be successfully used to modify bioactive 
natural products and native streptavidin to enable thiolmediated cellular uptake.

Description:
Undergoes C-modification through three-component Mannich-type reactions and reactions with aryldiazonium salts.

Text:
Several elegant methods have been reported for Cmodification 
of tyrosine, such as threecomponent Mannichtype reactions,9 
or reactions with aryldiazonium salts,10 diazodicarboxamides11 
and radicals.12 Ofunctionalization has also been described, with 
for example reaction with electrophilic allyl palladium 
complexes,13 SuFEx reagents14 and glycosylation reactions.15 
Functionalization 
has 
also 
been 
achieved 
via 
dearomatizationrearomatization strategies,16 or formation of 
a rhodium arene complex.17 All these strategies have 
advantages, but also inherent limitations, and therefore the 
development of alternative methods is still highly desirable.
