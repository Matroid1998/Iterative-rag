Description:
A ligand that can be modified by incorporating functional groups.

Text:
On the other hand, the modification of the 
tetraphenylporphyrin ligand by incorporating a methoxy group at the pposition of the aldehyde moiety 
may lead to a structural phase transition in the system because the methoxy group is known to show change 
in geometry at different temperatures.2426
