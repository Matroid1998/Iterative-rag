Description:
A matrix material that enhances the photocatalytic activity of polyoxometalate-based materials.

Text:
POMs have been widely used in catalysis, medicine and energy 
due to their high activity and excellent redox ability.89 In recent 
years, researchers have further improved the photocatalytic 
performance of polyoxometalatebased (POMbased) materials 
through the design and regulation of POMs.10 On the one hand, 
the bandgap of POMs can be tuned by changing the type of 
heteroatoms and metal atoms.1112 On the other hand, POMs 
loaded on titanium dioxide (TiO2), zeolite, activated charcoal, and 
other matrix materials achieve synergistic effects between various 
materials and ultimately enhance the photocatalytic activity of 
POMbased materials.9,13 At present, POMbased materials have 
been widely used in photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, 
clean energy conversion and storage, and solar cells.1415 
So far, some studies have systematically reviewed the 
application of POMbased photocatalysts.1011,1618 However, the 
visualization of the overall knowledge structure in this field isnt 
considered, and many research results are not effectively combed.
