Description:
The benchmark binder for cathodes due to its safety, chemical stability, and good adhesion.

Text:
Ukraine plays a crucial 
role in the global supply chain of CRMs used in battery production, including Ni, Mn, and graphite; 
it also has large Li reserves, although these are currently untapped and probably will be unavailable 
for some time due to the RussianUkrainian conflict.6 
However, LIBs are complex devices and do not only contain metals and graphite, but also valuable 
fluorinated materials. For example, fluorinated lithium salts organic solutions (e.g. 1.0M LiPF6 in 
ECDMC) are used as electrolytes; poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is the benchmark binder for the 
stateoftheart cathodes, due to its outstanding properties, such as safety, chemical stability, good 
adhesion to the current collectors and excellent freestanding performances.713
