Description:
A molecule investigated for its binding modes in adsorbents using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

The increasingly complex adsorbent 
materials under consideration bring major challenges in the characterisation of new carbon 
capture chemistry, hindering the design of improved materials.4 Existing characterisation 
tools for understanding CO2 capture modes include singlecrystal diffraction,1113 powder 
diffraction,14 infrared spectroscopy,6,10,15 Xray absorption spectroscopy,16 and NMR 
spectroscopy,8,1720 each of which has strengths and limitations in terms of the materials that 
can be studied and the information that can be obtained. Solidstate NMR spectroscopy is a 
promising tool for investigating CO2 binding modes in adsorbents as there is no requirement 
for longrange ordering and detailed information about the local structure and dynamics of the 
CO2 can be obtained.
