Their catalytic activity can be enhanced by doping or introducing oxygen vacancies.

Besides, as in the case of other transition
metal oxides 13, their catalytic activity can be enhanced
by doping or by introducing oxygen vacancies. In recent studies of OER reaction mechanisms on
cobalt oxides, surface Co ions have been proposed as the
active site for OER 1416. According to these propos
als, the oxidation state of cobalt increases during OER. As a result, the density and oxidation state of surface
cobalt ions are critical for OERORR activity. When
these reactions are catalyzed by manganese or cobalt
oxides or (oxy)hydroxides, it involves oxidation states
from 2 to 4, with the cation species M3 being the
main active center 1517.

Compounds that can have varying electronic configurations affecting their catalytic properties.

In many transition metal oxides, when Co3 is in the
intermediate spin state, it has the electronic congura
tion t5
2g e1
g, whereas Mn3 is in the t3
2g e1
g state 1820. Constructing catalysts with moderate binding strength
between the active sites and reactantsintermediates,
by optimizing the electronic conguration is an eec
tive strategy to improve their electrocatalytic OERORR
performance. The presence of a single electron in the
antibonding eg orbital is expected to yield just the ap
propriate strength of interaction between O2 and the cat
alyst required for high OER and ORR activity and it is
therefore considered to play a crucial role in the catalytic
properties of the oxides 1820.
