Description:
Species that can be confined via covalent bonding to the cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Text:
The lithiumsulfur (LiS) battery is a promising electrochemical storage system due to its
high theoretical energy density and costeffectiveness.1,2 However, several challenges hinder
its practical applications, including the electronic and ionic insulating nature of both sulfur
and the discharge product lithium sulfide (Li2S), the formation and shuttling of dissolved
lithium polysulfides species between the anode and the cathode, and complicated composi
tional and structural changes. To address these issues, the scientific community has proposed
several strategies, including (i) developing novel cathodes,3 anodes, binders, and electrolytes;
and (ii) advancing the understanding of LiS redox chemistries.4,5 One promising approach
involves the confinement of the polysulfides directly via the covalent bonding to the cathode
