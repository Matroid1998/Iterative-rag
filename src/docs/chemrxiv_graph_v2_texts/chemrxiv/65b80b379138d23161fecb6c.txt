Description:
Part of the carbinol carbon in lactols involved in dynamic kinetic resolution.

Text:
Kinetic resolution is a widely developed process 
that has been extensively used for industrial and academic 
applications to allow the effective preparation of enantiomerically 
pure compounds.1 Despite its widespread use, a recognised 
inherent drawback is that the theoretical maximum yield of a 
single product enantiomer from a racemate is 50. This limitation 
can be overcome by a using a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) 
approach, that necessitates the individual enantiomers of the 
racemic starting material to interconvert (enantiomerization) at a 
timescale compatible with a subsequent enantioselective 
derivatization event (such as acylation).1v Current stateofthe art 
DKRs commonly use secondary alcohols or trisubstituted lactols 
(that contain a Hsubstituent at the carbinol carbon), with 
enantiomerization 
promoted 
through 
reversible 
dehydrogenationhydrogenation (Fig 1AB) or intramolecular ring 
closurering opening (Fig 1CD).
