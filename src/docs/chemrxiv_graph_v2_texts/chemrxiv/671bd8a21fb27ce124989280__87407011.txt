Description:
A greenhouse gas released from the excessive use of fossil fuels.

Text:
Increasing energy demand due to population and industrial growth is rapidly depleting the 
limited resources available worldwide. Most of the global energy demand is met by using fossil 
fuels due to their high energy density. However, the excessive use of these fuels leads to climate 
change, as they release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Using 
renewable sources like solar energy can mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. However, solar energy is an intermittent energy resource, and thus 
cannot provide a consistent supply, matching with our current energy consumption practices. However, free energy can be stored within the chemical bonds of chemical compounds such as 
hydrogen, and controllably released through exothermic reactions without emitting greenhouse 
gases 1.
