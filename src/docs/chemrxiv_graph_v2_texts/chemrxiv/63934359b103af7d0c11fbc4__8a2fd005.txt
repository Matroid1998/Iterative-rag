Description:
Shows slightly higher metabolic stability than 3,3disubstituted oxetanes in a secretase inhibitor.

Text:
reported that gemdime
thyloxetane shows slightly higher metabolic stability than do 
3,3disubstituted oxetanes in a secretase inhibitor designed by 
the researchers.3 Fish et al. reported an EC50 improvement by 
azetidine incorporation into the 5HT2C agonist.4 The oxetane or 
azetidine motif can be also found in the structure of biologically 
active natural products and commercial drugs (e.g., paclitaxel 
and azelnidipine).2b,5 
 Recently, synthetic methods for fourmembered heterocycles 
have been reinvestigated to meet the high demand for these 
compounds in drug discovery,2b,56 and this places high priority 
on the three dimensionality of small molecules (Figure 1B).7 A 
typical synthetic method applicable to both oxetane and azet
idine is intramolecular displacement.
