Description:
Used in the presence of CO and CO2 to form C1C4 chain compounds.

Text:
A similar intermediate was also recently 
suggested by Jones and coworkers in the reductive coupling of CO using activated bdiketiminate Mg(I) 
complexes (Figure 1).15e,15g However, in these studies, the reactivity of the CO oligomerization products 
was not further explored. Very recently, Crimmin and coworkers described the sequential formation of 
C1C4 chain compounds starting from CO and CO2 feedstocks in the presence of transition metal carbonyl 
complexes and using bdiketiminate Al(I) reductants.15c,15k Other systems allowing sequential chain growth 
by reductive homologation of CO from isolable intermediates are exceedingly rare,15a and, to the best of 
our knowledge, have not been used in further functionalization reactions.
