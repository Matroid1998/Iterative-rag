Description:
An important fatty acid found in diatoms.

Text:
Most 
importantly, diatoms are an important 
source of fatty acids essential for higher 
consumers, especially EPA and ARA 1, and 
also contain low but significant amounts of 
DHA 5. In contrast, the major fatty acids in 
chlorophytes are linolenic acid (ALA, 
183n3), palmitic acid, oleic acid (181n
9), and linoleic acid (LIN, 182n6). Lastly, phosphatidylglycerol and some 
peculiar 
galactolipids 
are 
the 
main 
component of thylakoid membranes in all 
microalgae 
68, 
and 
especially 
their 
respective fatty acid constituent (i.e. molecular species) were partly investigated 
for diatom and chlorophyte species so far.
