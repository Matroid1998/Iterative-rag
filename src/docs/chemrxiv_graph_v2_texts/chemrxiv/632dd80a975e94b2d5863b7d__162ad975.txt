Description:
Promising new antibacterials produced by Photorhabdus khanii that target Gram-negative pathogens.

Text:
However, these mostly belong to 
already known compound classes or they are novel chemical 
entities attacking common targets, such as the broadspectrum 
ribosome 
inhibitor 
odilorhabdin, 
originally 
produced 
by 
Xenorhabdus nematophila.9 The darobactins, which are also 
produced by an entomopathogenic bacterium, Photorhabdus 
khanii,10 however, are some of the most promising new 
antibacterials in the last 50 years2 given they address a novel 
broadspectrum target in Gramnegative pathogens.

Description:
A family of bicyclic heptapeptides that belong to the biosynthetic class of ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs).

This 
mechanism of action overcomes common pathogenic resistance 
and are effective, not only in vitro, but also in vivo.2 This family of 
bicyclic heptapeptides belongs to the biosynthetic class of 
ribosomally 
synthesised 
and 
posttranslationally 
modified 
peptides (RiPPs).10 Darobactins distinguish themselves from 
other new antibiotic candidates, such as the recently published 
macolacin,11 as they do not affect human gut commensals of the 
family Bacteriodes, a beneficial characteristic considering the 
intended use in humans.10 Due to the selective binding to the 
barrel of the outer membrane protein (OMP) BamA, darobactin 
interferes with the integration of natural OMPs into the membrane 
by mimicking the OMP signalling peptide.12 As a consequence,
