Description:
Generated photocatalytically using cyclometalated iridium complexes as photosensitizers.

Text:
Cyclometalated iridium complexes with the general formula Ir(CN)2(NN) have been 
shown to have high molar extinction coefficients.13 This property makes them desirable 
candidates as photosensitizers (PS) for the photocatalytic hydrogen generation.49 While these 
catalysts can show turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 17,000, they are typically short
lived,10 as the catalysts tend to degrade over prolonged periods.1112 This is due to metal
ligand bonds rupturing in the presence of unstable radicals and anions, causing the cationic 
ligand moiety of the complex to dissociate.1214
