Description:
A component of thiamineThDP analogues with differing substructures.

Text:
Such analogues are ThDP
competitive inhibitors and generally feature a neutral central aromatic ring to capture the strong 
stabilising interactions between the enzymes hydrophobic region and the catalytically active high
energy ThDPylide V.2330 There are also reported thiamineThDP analogues having the central 
aromatic ring replaced with a saturated heterocycle31 or with a planar nonaromatic motif3236 but the 
principle is still to capture the hydrophobic interactions. In the past decade, over 300 such analogues 
as ligands of thiamineThDPdependent enzymes andor proteins have been reported in 27 research 
articles, and even more in patents.29,30,32,3659 Despite differing significantly in the substructures on the 
pyrimidine (R) and the hydroxyethyl tail (R), the derivatives feature a limited number of central rings.
