Description:
Incorporated at some corners of the cage to reduce strain in allsilica zeolites.

Text:
Because the equilibrium SiOSi angle is closer to 150 degrees,4,5 these 
building units are strained in allsilica zeolites.6 The strain can be reduced through an incorpo
ration of heteroatoms, especially germanium, at some corners of the cage,4,7 or through encapsu
lation of fluoride anions inside the cages.8,9 In fact, many allsilica zeolites containing d4r units 
have, so far, not been obtained in the absence of fluoride.
