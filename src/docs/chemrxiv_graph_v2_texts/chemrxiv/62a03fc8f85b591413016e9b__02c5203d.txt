Description:
Adducts are not resistant to biochemical nucleophiles and decompose in clinically relevant samples.

Text:
Notably, seven of twelve FDAapproved antibody
drug conjugates (ADC) are constructed via the Michael ad
dition reactions between Cys and maleimide13. Although maleimide has been widely used in protein label
ing since the discovery in the 1950s14, the thiolmaleimide re
action is limited by several drawbacks. First, maleimide may 
react with amine at higher pH to generate heterogenous mix
tures of conjugates, which links to the residue of Cys or Lysine 
(Lys)12. Second, the hydrolysis of maleimide in alkaline solu
tion results in an unreactive maleamic acid, which requires 
strict storage conditions for maleimide reagents15. Most im
portantly, thiolmaleimide adducts are not resistant to bio
chemical nucleophiles, and easily decompose in clinically rele
vant samples16.
