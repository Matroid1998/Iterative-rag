Description:
Mechanically chiral molecules where the mechanical bond provides the sole chirotopic stereogenic element.

Text:
Enantiopure samples of mechanically chiral molecules,1 rotaxanes and catenanes in which the mechanical bond provides the 
sole chirotopic stereogenic element have historically been produced by resolution of racemic samples2 or unusual chiral building 
blocks,3 both of which typically rely on preparative chiral stationary phase HPLC (CSPHPLC) separation of the product or building 
blocks, respectively. 4 Although these methods have allowed preliminary studies on the properties of mechanically chiral 
molecules,2f,g,3 the inherent limitations of CSPHPLC has prevented more detailed studies of their applications.
