Description:
A Heusler phase where Z can be Al, Si, Ga, or Ge.

Text:
Except a few Heusler phases (X2YZ, X, and Y are transition elements, Z  pblock elements; e.g. Co2MnZ (Z  Al, Si, Ga, Ge), Co2FeZ (Z  Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge), Cu2NiSn, atomic ordering between the 
neighbouring elements in ternary intermetallic compounds is very rare and often attracts the 
interest of structural chemists 13. The degree of ordering can range from complete disorder 
(random distribution of atoms) to complete order (strict alternation of atoms) and can have a 
significant impact on the physical and chemical properties of the material.
