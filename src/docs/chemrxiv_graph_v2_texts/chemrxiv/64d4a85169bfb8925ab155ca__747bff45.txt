Description:
Electron-rich compounds that can have additional hydroxyl groups.

Text:
In this 
context, we are particularly interested in discovering the activity of electronrich 
pyridines with additional hydroxyl groups, which, as will be shown, are easily 
accessible via the synthetic route discussed. Scheme 1
