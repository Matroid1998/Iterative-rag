Fluorinated bioactive small molecules have a remarkable role in modern medicinal 
50 
chemistry, as the incorporation of fluorine into drug candidates enhances their bioavailablility, 
51 
metabolic stability, binding affinity to target proteins, and provides a variety of beneficial 
52 
pharmacological properties14. One such compound is 5fluorouracil (5FU), a fluoropyrimidine 
53 
antimetabolite commonly used to treat colorectal cancer. A lipophilicmasked analog of 5FU, 
54 
carmofur, was developed as an antineoplastic agent which covalently inhibits acid ceramidase, 
55 
leading to ceramidaseinduced apoptosis58. Through recent drug repurposing efforts, carmofur 
56 
has been identified as a potent covalent inhibitor of SARSCoV2 main protease (Mpro) activity, 
57 
suggesting carmofur might be a novel antiviral lead for SARSCoV2 911 (Fig. 1b).
