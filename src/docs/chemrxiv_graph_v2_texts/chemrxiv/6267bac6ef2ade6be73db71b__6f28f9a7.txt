Description:
Inorganic compounds accessible through colloidal nanocrystal synthesis.

Text:
Since its early days,1 the research on colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) has provided access to a variety of 
inorganic compounds, spanning from metals and alloys2 to oxides,3,4 phosphides,5 chalcogenides,611 hal
ides12,13 and more. Nowadays, NCs are exploited in many different fields, as NCsbased products are 
steadily finding their way to commercial applications.1418 A colloidal approach to the synthesis of inor
ganic materials offers several advantages over more traditional solidstate chemistry techniques, such as 
milder reaction conditions, ease of tunability deriving from a wider choice of precursors, better processa
bility of the products, and straightforward access to nanostructured materials. However, both this flexibil
ity and the push toward materials combining a higher number of elements come at the cost of increased 
complexity.

Description:
Lead-based compounds with optoelectronic properties in the IR spectral range.

Text:
One example is the field of colloidal semiconductors, where leadbased NCs are among the 
most explored compounds due to the appealing optoelectronic properties demonstrated by lead halide 
perovskites in the UVVIS and by lead chalcogenides in the IR spectral ranges.6,7,12,13,19 There, the com
bination of as little as four elements (Cs, Pb, X and E, where X  F, Cl, Br or I and E  S, Se or Te) can 
yield NCs of a variety of phases the binaries CsX, PbX2 and PbE,6,7,2022 the wellknown cesium lead 
halides (Cs4PbX6, CsPbX3, and CsPb2X5),12,19,23,24 and the still little explored lead chalcohalides (Pb4S3Br2 
and Pb4S3I2).25,26 All these compounds are often obtained under similar reaction conditions, and can there
fore compete during the synthesis, requiring a careful tuning of the synthetic protocols to achieve the 
impurityfree synthesis of the desired product.
