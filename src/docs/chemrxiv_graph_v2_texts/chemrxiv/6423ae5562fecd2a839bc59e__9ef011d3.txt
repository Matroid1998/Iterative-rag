Description:
Compounds subject to nickel-catalyzed exhaustive hydrodefluorination.

The continuous environmental release of perfluoroalkyl 
substances has resulted in their ubiquity as persistent pollutants in air, water, and soil.3 
Some perfluoroalkyl gases show high global warming potentials,4 while others have been 
reported to accumulate in living organisms, including human beings.5 Therefore, the 
development of efficient decomposition methods is in urgent demand. The incineration 
of perfluoroalkyl substances requires very high temperatures and has the potential to 
produce volatile organofluorine waste.6 Other disposal methods are currently under 
intense investigation.7 For instance, recently, a mild homogeneous mineralization of
