Description:
Has an orthorhombic crystal structure with ordered cation vacancies, isostructural with Sc2Te3.

Text:
thorhombic crystal structure of Y2Te3 (space group Fddd, Figure
1) can be understood as a rocksalt derived structure with ordered
cation vacancies, which is isostructural with the orthorhombic
polymorph of Sc2Te3.25 The vacancyordered structures of Y2Te3
and Sc2Te3 are related to that of rhombohedral Sb2Te3, as ev
idenced by their phase transitions in phasechange memory al
loys.26 Specifically, the structural relationship can be understood
as a gathering of the ordered vacancies to form a van der Waals
gaps in the rhombohedral Sb2Te3 structure, similar to the phase
transition mechanism of Ge2Sb2Te5.27,28 Therefore, it is not sur
prising that layered structures such as Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3,29 which
are derived from rocksalt like structures, as well as Ge2Sb2Te5,30
are wellknown TE materials.
