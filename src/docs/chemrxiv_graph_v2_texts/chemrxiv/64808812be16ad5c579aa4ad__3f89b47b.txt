Description:
A ring structure that can cause steric congestion affecting reaction efficiency.

Text:
of a 6phenyl ring to 
the pyridine motif of L3 boosted the e.e. value to 40 (entry 4). Replacing the phenyl ring with a bulkier 
9anthracenyl group greatly enhanced the e.e. value to 77 (entry 5) and further switching to a non
symmetrically bulky 2indolyl group ultimately gave excellent enantioselectivity (entry 6). Nonetheless, 
the reaction efficiency was generally low with these tested ligands (entries 16) likely due to the steric 
congestion around the copper center caused by the bulky tertbutyl group on the oxazoline ring (see 
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for Xray structures of L6 and L7). Accordingly, a phenyl ring in place of this 
tertbutyl group resulted in substantially increased yield with almost unaltered enantioselectivity (entry 7).
