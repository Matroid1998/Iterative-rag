Description:
Experience corrosive degradation during OER through formation of oxidized and water-soluble transition metal species.

Text:
During water electrolysis, hydrogen is produced through electrochemical reduction of 
water at the cathode while the anode oxidizes water to oxygen via the oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER). Due to their high activity, perovskite oxides containing transition metals are among the 
most attractive electrocatalytic materials for water oxidation.1,2 However, during OER, perovskites 
experience corrosive degradation through the formation of oxidized and watersoluble transition 
metal species on the surface.310 A lack of fundamental understanding of how structure and 
composition of perovskite surfaces evolves during OER and which mechanisms drive their 
electrochemical degradation poses a significant challenge to the development of stable and active 
electrocatalysts.1114 
Several major pathways for the electrochemical degradation of perovskite electrocatalysts 
have been proposed.
