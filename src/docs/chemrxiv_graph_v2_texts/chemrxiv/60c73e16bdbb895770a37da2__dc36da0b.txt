Description:
Molecules assessed for their electron mobility as potential organic semiconductors.

Text:
For example, we proposed their use for the assessment of molecules
as potential organic semiconductors.15 To illustrate this, we assessed a series of azasubstituted
pentacenes where the targeted property is the electron mobility, which we calculated using Marcus
theory.15 ESF charge mobility maps have also been reported recently for racemic and enantiomer
ically pure crystal structures of 6helicene.16
Because molecular crystals are held together by many weak, competing noncovalent interac
tions and the possible crystal packing arrangements are typically close in energy, a subtle change
in molecular structure can result in completely different molecular arrangements in the low en
