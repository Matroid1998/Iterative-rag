Description:
An acid-stable protecting group used in peptide synthesis.

Text:
Once the octadeca(glyco)peptides were prepared, we fo
cused on the removal of the two acidstable protecting groups, 
namely neopentyl (Np) at the 2Tyr(SO3Np) and acetyl groups 
at the 16Hyp(2,3,5OAc)Ara03 . For the nonarabinosylated 
control peptide PSY1 16Hyp 20 only Np removal in 2M am
monium acetate solution fulfills the complete synthesis of this 
peptide resulting in Brassica PSY1 16Hyp 1. However, for 
glycopeptides 2123 the order of deprotection was found im
portant to maintain pure PSY1 peptide in complete sequence. Specifically, starting with Np removal from acetylated glyco
peptide 21 using a 2M ammonium acetate solution resulted in 
multiple peaks in liquid chromatography trace (Figure 3). Sub
sequent deacetylation did not provide the correct mass of the 
desired glycopeptide.
