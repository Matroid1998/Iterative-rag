Description:
Compounds with C(sp3)O bonds that are significant in biological and pharmaceutical contexts.

Text:
Because of the biological and pharmaceutical significance of oxygenated hydrocarbon frames and of the 
opportunities offered by C(sp3)O bonds for followup chemical elaboration, C(sp3)H bond oxygenation 
is an extensively investigated transformation16. Selecting among multiple nonequivalent CH bonds in 
organic molecules, and in particular targeting stronger bonds over weaker and intrinsically more activated 
ones, stand as some of the main challenges associated to the development of CH functionalization 
methods713. Such transformations would make accessible so far unconsidered paths allowing the 
streamlined synthetic elaboration of organic molecules.
