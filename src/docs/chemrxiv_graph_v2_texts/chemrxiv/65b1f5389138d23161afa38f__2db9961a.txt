Description:
A lithium conducting salt used in lithium ion battery electrolytes.

Although the exact electrolytic composion for present day lithium ion batteries (LIBs) may differ 
among different scenarios, the electrolytes 1 usually employ a mixture of alkyl carbonates such 
as ethylene carbonate (EC)), dimethyl carbonate (DMC)) and lithium conducting salts (e.g., 
LiPF6) 2. Neverthless, alkyl carbonates are flammable, and this has been the main cause of 
safety concerns to the LIB technology 3. For these reasons, therefore, there have been 
considerable research efforts to mitigate those safety concerns, and to design alternative 
electrolyte compositions with improved thermal stability that would be able to work in a broader 
operative temperature range 4. The primary design concept in electrolyte engineering involves 
balancing conflicting physicochemical properties such as low viscosity with high conductivity, 
and low charge transfer resistance with electrode passivation 5.
