TEMPO is a versatile catalyst for oxidation reac
tions, and its disproportionation in acidic media contributes
to its reactivity under these conditions.49 Our efforts to un
derstand these reactions revealed a void in available kinetic
derivations for disproportionation kinetics and prompted the
presentation here. Previously, this reaction has been studied
in strongly acidic media where it can be treated as irreversible
for the purposes of determining k f from initial rate data.10
This new method allows for the determination of both k f and
kb from timecourses that extend past the initial rate regime
into the approach to equilibrium. N
