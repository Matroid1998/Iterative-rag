Description:
Components of coacervates that can form membraneless compartments.

Text:
In recent years, liquidliquid 
phase separation has also emerged as a ubiquitous route to the formation of membraneless 
compartments by partly disordered proteins in living cells.1820 Their widespread occurrence and 
central roles suggest that prebiotic analogues of these intracellular condensates could have played 
a role in the emergence of cells. However, the fact that coacervates are typically made of large 
molecules and often require multiple interacting components is commonly regarded as a serious 
barrier for their relevance as protocells.6,13 Coacervates made of single nucleotide triphosphates,13
