Description:
Undergo transthioesterification reactions.

Text:
Examples include 
silicones containing dynamic bonds that undergo boronic ester exchange 6, 7, transamination of 
vinylogous urethanes, 4 and transthioesterification of Meldrums acids. 3 However, the selfhealing and 
reprocessability enabled by such dynamic bonds are typically achieved at the cost of the mechanical 
strength and creep resistance of the vitrimer. The tradeoff between the mechanical strength and the selfhealing ability of vitrimers has motivated 
research on strategies to optimize such antagonistic properties. This effort has led to the development 
of vitrimers combining multiple types of crosslinkers, 812 reinforced with particle fillers 1315 or featuring 
novel architectures at the meso or macroscales.
