Metal phosphido compounds are important synthetic intermediates in organophos
13

phorus chemistry 13. Most copper phosphido compounds characterized by Xray crys
14

tallography have oligomeric structures 415 with a few notable exceptions 16, 17. We 
15

have been studying these types of compounds as intermediates in copper catalyzed hy
16

drophosphination 18. During our study, we isolated the novel bridging phosphido 
17

copper cluster, Cu4(PPh2)4(PtBu3)2 (1) and were able to determine its molecular structure 
18

using Xray diffraction (Figure 1). We also demonstrate that 1 is an active hydrophos
19

phination precatalyst. 20
