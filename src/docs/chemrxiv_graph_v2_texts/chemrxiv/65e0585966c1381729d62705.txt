Description:
A simple metal cation detected by ion-selective electrodes.

Text:
An ionophore is a compound that can carry specific ions through membranes of cells or organelles. Historically, this term was reserved for biological systems, but ionophores are also used in chemical 
sensors. An ionophore is the main component determining the membrane selectivity in a 
potentiometric ionselective electrode (ISE). The search for new ionophores with a good affinity for 
various groups of compounds has been going on for decades. These efforts resulted in the 
development of sensors for determining simple metal cations such as Na, K and inorganic anions (F 
and CN) as well as more complex organic cations and anions1.
