Description:
Capable of initiating free-radical polymerization of acrylamide monomers under 532 nm irradiation.

Text:
In combination with Nphenylglycin (NPG) as a coinitiator, new BODIPYs showed the ability to initiate 
a freeradical polymerization of acrylamide monomers under 532 nm irradiation. This allowed for holographic recording of diffractive 
structures with diffraction efficiency of up to 56 obtained for CAPEG layers with BODIPYpyrene dyad as compared to a reference heavy
atomcontaining diiodoBODIPY dye (27). The materials sensitized with diethoxycarbonylBODIPYs showed refractive index modulation of 
up to 2.3  103 during holographic recording at the spatial frequency of 800 linesmm which demonstrate the potential of SOCTISC 
photosensitizers in photopolymerization and holographic recording applications.
