Description:
Less abundant in the earth's crust compared to magnesium and more prone to dendrite formation as an anode.

Text:
Furthermore, magnesium is highly abundant in the earths crust (with 
2.1 around 104 times more often than lithium) and suspected to be less prone to dendrite 
formation as anode, compared to lithium.3 
To circumvent the drawbacks of liquidbased cell systems such as the passivation and 
corrosion of the Mg electrode, and ensure a lower susceptibility to dendrite formation as well 
as higher levels of safety, solidstate battery concepts are pursued.1,4,5 Here, one of the main 
challenges is to develop a solid electrolyte (SE) that has a sufficient Mgion roomtemperature
