Description:
A molecule that binds to ABC transporters, facilitating energy coupling in cells.

Text:
Energycoupling factor (ECF) transporters are a recently discovered subclass of the superfamily of adenosine 5
triphosphate (ATP)binding cassette (ABC) transporters. While ABC transporters are present in all prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic species,14 mediating uptake or extrusion of compounds into and from cells, the ECF transporters 
are absent in humans but present in approximately 50 of prokaryotic species. This class of proteins mediates 
the uptake of essential micronutrients such as watersoluble vitamins (e.g., folate,5 riboflavin,6 cobalamin,7 
biotin,8 niacin,9 thiamine,10 pantothenate11) and metal cations (Ni2 and Co2)12,13 into bacteria and archaea.
