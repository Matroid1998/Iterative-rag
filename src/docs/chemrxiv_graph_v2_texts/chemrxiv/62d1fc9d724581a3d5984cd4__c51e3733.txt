Description:
Can be borylated under sterically controlled catalytic systems which give meta selectivity to alkyl groups.

For transition metal ca
talysis, various strategies to gain specific regioselectivity 
(ortho vs. meta vs. para) such as introduction of directing 
groups1315 or utilization of steric16,17 or electronic effects18
20 resulting from the preinstalled functional groups have 
been extensively developed. In particular, alkylbenzenes 
can be borylated under sterically controlled catalytic sys
tems which give meta selectivity to alkyl groups.16,17 How
ever, the steric control can also limit the scope of alkylben
zenes because the catalyst cannot access sterically hin
dered CH bonds, notably those ortho to alkyl groups.

Description:
Compounds that can be borylated to form aryl boronic esters, often at ortho or para positions.

Con
sequently, transitionmetal catalyzed borylation of steri
cally hindered arenes such as mesitylene where all aro
matic CH bonds are ortho to alkyls have been limited.21 An 
exceptional example was reported by Chatani and cowork
ers 
utilizing 
an 
NHCligated 
platinum 
catalyst, 
(ICy)Pt(dvtms) (ICy  1,3dicyclohexylimidazol2ylidene, 
dvtms  divinyltetramethyldisiloxane) where sterically 
encumbered alkylbenzenes such as mesitylene could be 
borylated to give corresponding aryl boronic esters.21 
As an alternative to transition metalcatalyzed chemistry, 
electrophilic arene borylation using boronbased electro
philes follows the general trend of reactivity and selectivi
ty of SEAr mechanism and thus shows selectivity in elec
tronrich CH bonds (electronic control), often at the or
tho or parapositions of alkylbenzenes (Figure 1a).12 In 
general, classical boronbased electrophiles consist of a 
single boron moiety connected to auxiliary mono or poly
dentate ligands that control the electrophilicity of the bo
ron center.
