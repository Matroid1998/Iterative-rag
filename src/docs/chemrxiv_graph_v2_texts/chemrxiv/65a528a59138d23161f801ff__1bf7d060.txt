Description:
A fluorescent molecular rotor dye that shows increased fluorescence when high viscosity or a crowded environment hinders twisting motions.

Text:
We assumed that for
mation of covalent bonds with cell surface glycans will increase friction acting on the fluorescence dye. Furthermore, cell surface layers should have a higher viscosity than the cell media. Both effects provide 
opportunities for fluorogenic labeling by fluorescent molecular rotor (FMR) dyes such as CCVJ or Cy3,8
10 which show increased fluorescence when high viscosity or the crowded environment of a binding part
ner hinders twisting motions. So far, binding induced enhancements of CCVJ or Cy3 emission have been 
demonstrated for interactions with proteins.8, 11, 12 Herein, we show that binding of CCVJ and Cy3 to 
glycans on the cell surface is likely to elicit a similar response.
