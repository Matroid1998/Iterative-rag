Resolving ultrafast excitedstate dynamics in
molecules14 is an ultimate goal in modern
physics and chemistry. In addition to its fun
damental importance in natural sciences, such
knowledge can also be exploited in various tech
nological areas such as molecular data stor
age5 and the production of green energy based
on solar energy conversion6 and photocataly
sis.7 Photoactive transition metal complexes8
are among the mostinvestigated molecules ow
ing to their favorable properties, both in terms
of applications (e.g., strong absorption in the
visible region, longlived excited states) and im
plementation of timeresolved Xray scattering
and spectroscopic experiments.9 Fe complexes
are particularly appealing as they are cheap,
environment friendly, and several of them pos
sess advantageous excitedstate profiles.
