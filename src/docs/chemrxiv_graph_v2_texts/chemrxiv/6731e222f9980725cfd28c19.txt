Description:
Ligands used in the synthesis of Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision.

Text:
The synthesis of 1nmsized Pt nanoclusters (Pt NCs) and their 
alloy NCs has garnered significant interest owing to their unique 
properties and potential applications in catalysis. Using carbon 
monoxide (CO) ligands,1,2 Pt NCs (Ptn(CO)m NCs; where n and m are 
the numbers of Pt atoms and CO ligands, respectively) can be 
synthesized with atomic precision.36 Most such NCs are not stable 
under atmospheric conditions, and thus few studies have been 
conducted on their application.

Used as a ligand in the synthesis of Pt NCs under atmospheric conditions.

However, a recently developed 
method for the synthesis of Pt NCs under atmospheric conditions 
using CO and phosphines (PR3) or thiolates (SR) as ligands 
(Ptn(CO)m(PR3)l or Ptn(CO)m(SR)o NCs, respectively) has emerged as a 
simple and convenient way to generate such NCs in large quantities.7

In particular, Pt17(CO)12(PPh3)8z (z  1 or 2; PPh3  
triphenylphosphine; Fig. 1a) represents a unique form of Pt NCs 
that can be synthesized under atmospheric conditions and 
exhibit remarkable stability. These NCs not only are structurally 
distinct but also serve as highly effective precursors of catalysts 
for reactions, including CO oxidation, propylene oxidation, and 
oxygen reduction.8,11,13 Their robust catalytic activity highlights 
their potential, making them invaluable in the development of 
highperformance catalysts for various fields. However, the
