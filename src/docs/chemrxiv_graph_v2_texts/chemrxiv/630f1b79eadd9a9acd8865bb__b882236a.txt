Description:
Forms a complex with a borylene ligand that reversibly adds H2.

Text:
Reversible reaction of 1 with H2 to form PdMg and 22 ligand, have 
been discussed.18 Defined examples of reversible behaviour are more limited, the majority of 
these involve boronbased ligands. For example, SaboEtienne and coworkers reported the 
reversible addition of H2 to a ruthenium complex supported by a borylene ligand.19 Peters and 
coworkers documented reversible reactions of H2 to a nickelborane, ironborane, and cobalt
borane complexes.2,46 More recently, Okuda and coworkers reported the reversible reaction 
of H2 with a GaZn compound, mediated by changes in solvent polarity.20 Reversible 
dihydrogen activation by these systems offers a potential approach to catalytic HDexchange. However, reports of such reactivity are limited.
