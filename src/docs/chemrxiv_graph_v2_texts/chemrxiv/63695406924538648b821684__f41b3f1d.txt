Description:
Products formed through CH borylation, expected to show enhanced reactivity.

Text:
This reaction creates a point for further synthetic derivatisation at a position 
originally devoid of functionality.6 In the past few years, we, and others, have introduced new catalytic 
approaches that expand this concept to metallic main group elements.7 Methods for the catalytic 
alumination (CH to CAl), magnesiation (CH to CMg) and zincation (CH to CZn) of aromatic 

2 
and heteroaromatic ring systems have been reported.812 These approaches are complementary to CH 
borylation, in that they create organometallic reagent in place of organoborane products. These species 
are expected to show enhanced reactivity, some interesting examples of which are emerging.
