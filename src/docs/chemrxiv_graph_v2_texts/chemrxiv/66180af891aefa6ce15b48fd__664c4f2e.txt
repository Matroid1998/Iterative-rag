Description:
An amphiphilic polymer used to improve stability in biomedically relevant media.

Text:
The incorporation of amphiphilic polymers like poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) into the NHC design improves NHCAuNPs stability in 
biomedically relevant media. Johnson7b, 10f, Crudden10b, Nazemi10c, 11, 12c, and coworkers have successfully achieved this, obtaining 
colloidally stable PEGylated NHCAuNPs (PEGNHCAuNP) by the bottomup reduction of PEGylated NHCgold complexes. However, topdown methods to install PEGylated NHCs on preprepared Au nanomaterials? would grant access to different Au 
nanostructures and their differing physicochemical properties for specific applications.1b, 7b, 14 
To install structurally intact PEGNHCs on AuNPs, a mild NHC activation approach is crucial to prevent damage to the NHC precursor 
structure. Masked NHCs as a mixture of IMZHCO3 and NHCCO2 offer a gentle way to generate active NHCs via the HCO3 counterion
