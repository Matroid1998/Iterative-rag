Description:
Forms paddlewheel metal nodes in MOFs used in computational screening.

Furthermore, there are few works that relied on the 
computed mechanical properties to elucidate the collapse 
events for certain MOFs.9,10 
In our present work, computational screening was 
conducted to evaluate the activation status of MOFs with 
copper paddlewheel metal nodes (the scheme of the work 
is illustrated in Figure 1). Based on our observation, many 
of the MOFs that have been previously reported to collapse 
have Cu metal nodes, and as a case study, only those with 
the Cu paddlewheel type were selected in this work. The 
structure of this paper is as follow; in the Methods section, 
we described how the activation data was collected and 
prepared for the analysis. In the Result and Discussion 
section, the relationship between the collapse and 
geometricalmechanical properties are presented.
