Description:
A straight-chain diol used in industrial applications such as composites, adhesives, and copolymers.

Among these deoxygenated
11
intermediates, the straightchain diol 1,3PDO finds numerous industrial appli
12
cations including, e.g., composites, adhesives and copolymers (Scheme 1).8
13
Currently, 1,3PDO is produced industrially employing petroleumbased feed
14
stocks and using either acrolein (DegussaDupont process) or ethylene oxide
15
(Shell process) as starting material.2 The desired selective hydrogenolysis of
16
biomassderived glycerol into 1,3PDO is not satisfactory,913 since glycerol
17
conversion is low and selectivity is hampered by the formation of less valu
18
able 1,2PDO and other degraded products such as acrolein.14 In particular,
19
propanediol selectivity favors 1,2PDO, which is the thermodynamically pre
20
ferred species over kinetically controlled 1,3PDO formation.3
21
Glycerol conversion to 1,3PDO has been explored on various supported tran
22
sition metal catalysts including, e.g, Cu, Ru, Pt and Rhbased catalysts.15
23
19 Experimental studies highlight that a significant amount of 1,3PDO is only
24
formed in the presence of a cocatalyst, which typically is the oxide of group 6
25
or 7 metal.10 In the literature, e.g., ReOxmodified Ru, Rh and Ir catalysts
26
and WOxmodified Rh and Pt have been reported to catalyze glycerol transfor
27
mation to 1,3PDO.6, 9, 15, 2024 In a combined experimental and compu

tational study,11 the selective hydrogenolysis of polyols and cyclic ethers over
29
a ReOHRh catalyst was reported to occur due to the stability of a secondary
