Description:
A complex where metal frontier orbitals mix with Cp ligand orbitals to create partially covalent bonds.

This turns could allows us to gain some control over the electronic structure 
of these complex elements.5 For example, it has been shown that the engagement of 5f orbitals in 
Cmligand bonds can be increased by using softdonor ligands that can be further enhanced by 
applying mechanical pressure.2b 
Quantum mechanical evaluation of a recently reported Am(III) cyclopentadienyl (Cp) complex 
showed that a variety of metal frontier orbitals were mixing with Cp ligand orbitals to create 
partially covalent bonds, but also revealed a surprising degree of ionicity in the AmN interactions 
with 4,4bipyridine in the same complex.6 However, complexes of this type remain rare largely 
due to low available quantities of these isotopes (reactions are completed with  5 mg of metal 
content), the need for specialized research faciltities, and their exceptional air and moisture 
sensitivity.5d,68 Owing to these difficulties, syntheses allowing the structural characterization of 
AnC (An  Pu, Am, Cf) have only recently become accessible and can be applied to curium.
