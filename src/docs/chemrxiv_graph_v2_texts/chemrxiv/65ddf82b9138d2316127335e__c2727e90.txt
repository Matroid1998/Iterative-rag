Description:
A complex family of molecules containing at least one hydroxy group attached to an aromatic ring, prevalent in plants and fungi.

Text:
Polyphenols are a complex family of molecules that contain at least one hydroxy group attached
to an aromatic ring. This molecular family can be separated into several distinct classes based on
the backbone structure (Fig. 1a) 1. Polyphenols are prevalent phytochemicals found in various
plants and fungi. They are derived from secondary metabolite pathways which are not yet
completely understood. For example, they can derive from the shikimate pathway which involves
producing Lphenylalanine, Ltyrosine, and Ltryptophan from the intermediate shikimic acid and
these three amino acids are the building blocks for various polyphenols 2. The production of
polyphenols is modulated by both, biotic and abiotic, stress of the plants and fungi, such as
herbivores, UV radiation or temperature 2. Polyphenols are involved in various biological
processes, e.g.

Description:
Compounds present in specific species that assist in understanding the function of PPOs and their involvement in biological pathways.

Text:
Understanding a PPOs function requires
understanding its substrate scope, and it is assumed that different substrates are accepted based on
the amino acids surrounding the active site of PPOs 4. Thus, knowing which polyphenols are
present in specific species might assist in better understanding the function of PPOs and the
involvement of both polyphenols and PPOs in biological pathways 9, 10. In general, extensive analysis of a high number of diverse polyphenols in different plants and
fungi species is limited to date, especially as numerous polyphenols exist (Fig. 1a). To measure a
multitude of polyphenols simultaneously, liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass
