Description:
Esters that accumulate in fatty acid oxidation disorders and serve as biomarkers of metabolic health.

Text:
Fatty acid oxidation 
43 
disorders (FAOD) occur due to the deficient activity of the enzymes or transporter proteins 
44 
involved in the pathway, which results in the accumulation of acylCoA esters3. The acyl
45 
CoA accumulation profile provides information on the type of fatty acid oxidation disorder 
46 
(FAOD). Intracellular acylCoA levels are important reporters of metabolic health and their 
47 
accumulation in case of FAOD makes them interesting biomarkers7. Apart from FAOD, 
48 
these compounds are also involved in progression of cancer810, diabetes1114, precursors 
49 
for lipid synthesis and ketone bodies. Since acylCoA are involved in numerous physiological 
50 
and pathophysiological pathways, it is important to develop analytical methods for their 
51 
identification and quantification.

Description:
Analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry due to its higher sensitivity and selectivity.

Text:
However, liquid 
61 
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS), is the most widely used technique for 
62 
acylCoA analysis due to its higher sensitivity and selectivity. On the other hand, severe peak 
63 
tailing, signal deterioration, and poor detection limits are common obstacles associated with 
64 
this approach23,24. Various efforts have been made to cover the full range of acylCoA in a 
65 
single analytical run. One such method is to use ionpairing reagents such as triethylamine25 
66 
or dimethylbutyl amine16,26. However, ionpairing reagents are reported to decrease mass 
67 
spectrometry signal intensity27 and frequent cleaning of detectors is required. Another
