Description:
Undergoes partial oxidation to form maleic anhydride.

Heterogeneously catalyzed gas phase reactions are commonly carried out in fixed
bed reactors throughout the chemical processing industry (Eigenberger and Ruppel
(2012)). Slender tubes with only a few particles along the tube diameter are required
for highly endothermic and exothermic reactions, such as the partial oxidation of n
butane to maleic anhydride (MA) (Muller et al. (2022)), to efficiently supply or remove
the heat while keeping the pressure drop at a moderate level. Due to the pronounced
effect of the tube wall on the particle arrangement, the small tubetoparticle diameter
ratio (Dtdp  10) results in an inhomogeneous packed bed morphology (Zio lkowska
and Zio lkowski (1988)), affecting fluid flow, heat and species mass transport (Dixon
(2021a)), as well as chemical reactions (Wehinger, Eppinger, and Kraume (2015)).
