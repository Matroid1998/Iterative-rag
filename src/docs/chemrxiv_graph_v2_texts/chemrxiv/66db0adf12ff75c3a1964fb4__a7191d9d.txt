RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
UiO66NH2, formed by the coordination of hexanuclear zirconiumoxo cluster and 2aminoterephthalate (BDCNH2), possesses a 
cubic structure with a composition of Zr6O6(BDCNH2)6.20, 34 It has been reported that crystallinity can be enhanced with modulators 
such as hydrochloric acid,35 benzoic acid,36 formic acid,37 and acetic acid.38 Achieving 2D films of UiO66NH2 is particularly chal
lenging due to the isotropic bond strength, which makes it difficult to synthesize anisotropic UiO66NH2 directly. To address this, 
synthesis conditions were modulated by screening different amounts of acetic acid as modulator to improve crystallinity, various 
metal and ligand concentrations, metaltoligand ratio, and the pH. Importantly, water was used as a solvent, keeping sustainability 
in mind. Atomically smooth graphitic substrates were used to promote inplane growth.
