Description:
The largest component of recycled plastics globally, making up 55% in 2017.

However, assessing product values can be challenging for earlystage 
technologies, leading to the generous use of the term for processes that yield defined products. Even in forerunning economies such as in the EU where 35 of plastics are recycled (2020)13 there is a big 
discrepancy between the different types of plastics produced and the available recycling technologies that are 
specific to different types of polymers. Globally the largest component of recycled plastics is made up of 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 55 in 2017)14 which only makes up 9 (in 2015)1 of the overall plastics 
production. Easier to recycleor chemically transformpolymers contain heteroatoms in their backbone (C
X) offering a selective site which may be cleaved by processes like solvolysis.
