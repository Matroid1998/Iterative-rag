Description:
Derived in situ from sulfonyl hydrazides for radical cyclization.

Text:
Alkyl diazenes 
are a prime candidate for radical precursors that could achieve such an objective (14, 15). These 
species have been invoked since the late 1930s (16, 17) yet their use in organic synthesis has been 
sporadic and mainly relegated to 2edefunctionalization methods such as the classic Wolff
Kishner reduction and related reactions (1721) (Figure 1B, left). A provocative report on the use 
of in situ derived diazenes from sulfonyl hydrazides was reported by Taber in 1993 wherein the 
radical cyclization of ketone 1 to octahydroindane 2 was achieved (Figure 1B, right) (22). Building 
on this precedent, we wondered if free radicals derived without redoxinitiation from these 
intermediates could be enlisted in metal catalyzed crosscoupling events.
