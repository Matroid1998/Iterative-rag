Text:
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widelyproduced commodity thermoplastic in the world, comprising more than 60 of the 
total plastic content in the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream.1 Approximately 100 million tons of PE are produced 
annually for innumerable applications, including food packaging, plastic bottles, and grocery bags.2 While PE 
thermoplastics are recyclable via meltprocessing in principle, their presence in multicomponent materials and mixed 
waste streams makes traditional recycling costly in practice.
