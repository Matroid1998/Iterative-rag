Description:
Used as a methyl donor in SN2 methylation catalyzed by SAM MTases.

Text:
Sadenosyl methionine methyltransferases (SAM MTases) are a ubiquitous class of 
enzymes. SAM MTases are observed in a wide range of organisms including bacteria, fungus, 
plants, and humans.14 SAM MTases catalyze SN2 methylation, using SAM as a methyl donor. Their functions are involved in many essential life processes, including gene expression,57 protein 
modification,810 neurotransmitter degradation,1113 and natural product synthesis.1416 SAM 
MTases target various types of atoms, including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur (Scheme 1).

Enabled by advances in structural determination, kinetic studies, and multiscale molecular 
modeling,1720 the mechanistic detail of SAM MTases has been unveiled.2123 Combination of 
binding isotope effect experiment and largescale quantum mechanical calculations shows the 
dependence of ground state donoracceptor distance on the catalytic efficiency of catecholO
methyltransferase.18, 24, 25 Investigations into CH hydrogen bonding have elucidated the role of 
these nonbonding interactions in ensuring catalytic efficiency.2628 Analysis of charge transfer and 
electrostatics on four Class I SAM MTases has illustrated the ability of these enzymes to customize 
their electrostatic potentials to the intrinsic reactivity of their target substrates.29
