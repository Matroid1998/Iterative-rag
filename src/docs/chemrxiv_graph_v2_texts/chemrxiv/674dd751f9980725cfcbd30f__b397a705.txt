Description:
Used in halogen bond catalysts to activate diverse organic processes.

Similarly, the use 
of haloorganic motifs as halogen bond catalysts also shows 
significant potential as an effective route to new catalyst 
exemplars that in many cases are capable of activating an 
array of diverse and important organic processes; examples 
include DielsAlder reaction9, Nheteroarene reduction10, 
Michael addition reaction11, and imine activation12. It is also 
noteworthy that the vast majority of halogenbond catalysts 
incorporate either iodo (I), bromo (Br), or chloro (Cl) 
groups. A fact that contrasts sharply with the limited 
number of reactions catalyzed via Fhalogen bonding 
interactions, which, to date, have received scant attention8. The existence of Fhalogen bonding has been 
deliberated for some time.
