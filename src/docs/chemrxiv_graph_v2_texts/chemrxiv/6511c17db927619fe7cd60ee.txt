Description:
A common anthropogenic greenhouse gas with a lower global warming potential compared to methane.

Text:
Methane is the primary hydrocarbon component in natural gas and the second most common anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG), 
after carbon dioxide (US EPA 2023). In 2021, methane represented approximately 17 of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (CCAC 
2021), including emissions from the agriculture, waste, and energy sectors. In the atmosphere, methane has a relatively short 
atmospheric lifetime of approximately 12 years and a higher global warming potential, relative to carbon dioxide (IPCC 2013). Near
term methane reductions have become a focus for many policymakers through efforts like the Global Methane Pledge (CCAC 2021), 
which seeks a 30 reduction in anthropogenic methane emissions across all sectors by 2030 compared to a 2020 baseline.
