Description:
Predominantly found in polycyclic molecules with distributed systems that interact with visible light.

Text:
Shape change in metal ion coordination environments 
is well known to affect measured properties, especially 
spectral, magnetic, and biological properties.3 Interaction 
with visible light is conceptually linked to dblock metal 
complexes and polycyclic, predominantly carbon molecules 
with distributed systems, each with electronic states 
separated by an energy compatible with the incident photon.
