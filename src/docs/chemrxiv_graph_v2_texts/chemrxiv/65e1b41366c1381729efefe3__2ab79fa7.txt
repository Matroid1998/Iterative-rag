Description:
A hybrid layer that introduces new defect states and enhances stability for solar water oxidation.

of the interfacial PEI layer and the hybrid PEITiO2 not only mitigates this 
energetic misalignment but also promotes holeselective transfer, facilitated by the electron
blocking nature of the PEI and the introduction of new defect states within the hybrid PEITiO2 
layer (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig 28). Conclusion 
In summary, we investigated hybrid PEITiO2 as a protection layer for metal oxide photoanodes 
that significantly enhances the stability of these materials for solar water oxidation. The hybrid 
TiO2 layer was formed on the interfacial PEI layer during the ALD process, and we observed 
distinct energetics associated with a new defect state resulting from the partial reduction of Ti4
