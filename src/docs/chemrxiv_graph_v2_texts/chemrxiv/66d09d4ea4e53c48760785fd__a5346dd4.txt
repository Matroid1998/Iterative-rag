Description:
A high-valence element used as a dopant to enhance the lifespan of CAMs.

Similarly, both may induce a coreshell structure that can stabilize
the Nirich phase at the surface, thus enhancing the overall stability of the cathode.14,15
A recent trend has emerged in which highvalence elements such as tantalum, tungsten,
molybdenum, and niobium are used as dopants to enhance the lifespan of CAMs. Initially,
these elements were thought to be too large and positively charged to integrate into the
material structure, but recent studies indicate otherwise.16,17 How and where the dopant is
incorporated into the material is significantly affected by the synthesis routine and calci
