Description:
Involved in ligand coupling comparisons with iodine.

Text:
The frontier orbitals of palladium were included in early mechanistic 
interpretations (ca. 1980) of reductive elimination.6 However, a reanalysis of the frontier orbitals on iodine 
have only recently been included in a comparison of ligand coupling from diarylhalonium salts,7 but not 
specifically in the context of the full mechanism of nucleophile arylation with diaryliodonium salts.
