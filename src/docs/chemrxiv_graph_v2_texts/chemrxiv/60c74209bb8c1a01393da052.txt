Description:
A strong gamma emitter with a thermal output of approximately 70 mWg.

Of 
these, 137Cs is of greatest concern as a strong gamma emitter, with a 
combined  thermal output of ca 70 mWg.8 
Many natural and synthetic materials selectively isolate and retain Cs 
ions effectively from aqueous solutions, but few operate effectively 
at acidic pH values.915 Ammonium phosphomolybdate (AMP, 
(NH4)3PMo12O40) is an exception to this,1618 able to effectively remove 
even trace Cs from decontamination liquors,19 tank wastes,20 and

liquors,21,22 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
high 
concentrations of other alkali metals,16,17 or higher valence ions.22 
AMP is a dense, fine powder, often implemented as a porous 
composite in a polyacrylonitrile matrix (PAN) to facilitate column 
processing.18,19,23 While both AMP and PAN are acid and radiation
resistant, irradiation of both components has been characterised to 
a greater or lesser extent,2427 and a significant volume of literature 
has studied the ion exchange performance of these compounds 
following irradiation,18,2730 effect of radiation on their physiochemical 
properties is less well understood,15,23,27 which are of great 
importance when considering the practical application of such 
materials in the nuclear industry.
