Description:
A polymer analyzed using SECMS for determining molecular weight distributions.

Text:
reported several practical advantages of the SECMS, including improved signal intensities 
when compared with ESIMS with direct infusion, effective estimation of endgroup masses, and 
determination of the absolute MWD.14 SECMS has been applied to a variety of polymers, including 
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyacrylamide (PAM), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and aromatic 
polyesters.1620 
Thus, SECMS is an excellent method for simultaneously determining MWDs, CCDs, and FTDs. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20243c8dzv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000746083699 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
