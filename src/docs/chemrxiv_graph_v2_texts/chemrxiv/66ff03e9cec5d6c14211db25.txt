Description:
A C1 source used in photochemical methodologies to access carboxylic acid functionalities.

Text:
The recent resurgence of photochemistry has driven the 
discovery of new bond disconnections not accessible through 
traditional twoelectron pathways.9 In particular, the development 
of photochemical methodologies utilizing C1 sources (e.g., CO2, 
HCOO) to readily access carboxylic acid functionalities has garnered 
significant 
attention. Contemporary 
photochemical 
radical 
carboxylation strategies typically operate via the challenging direct 
reduction of CO2 (E12  2.21 V vs SCE)10 or hydrogen atom 
abstraction from formate salts to access a highly reactive CO2 
intermediate.
