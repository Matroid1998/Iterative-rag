Description:
A product of ethylene glycol oxidation.

Text:
Ethylene glycol is a widely and diversely utilized com
pound in chemical industry with a global production of
57 million metric tons in 20221, applications of which
range from automotive to pharmaceutical. Recently, at
tention has been drawn to its role as sustainable feed
stock for numerous chemical processes, including, among
others, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and antifreeze
production, and in textile industry2,3. Furthermore, the
selective oxidation of ethylene glycol to produce value
added products holds great promise for the development
of ecologically friendly and economically viable processes. Depending on the reaction conditions and the nature of
the used catalyst, oxidation of ethylene glycol can yield
a variety of products, including glycolaldehyde, glycolic
acid, glyoxylic acid, glyoxal, oxalic acid, formic acid, and
even fully oxidized carbon dioxide.

Description:
A single carbon compound observed in low quantities during the oxidation of ethylene glycol.

Text:
In a study on the electrochemical oxidation of ethylene
glycol, Chauhan and coworkers4 utilized a platinum
catalyst in a channel flow reactor and observed selective
oxidation with high yield of glycolic acid, compared to
other products. They furthermore noticed low quantities
of single carbon (C1) compounds such as formic acid
and carbon dioxide, and suggested that the pathway to

carbon dioxide production is still unclear and requires
a high oxidative potential to achieve C C bond
cleavage. To enhance the catalytic activity of Pt, Kim
and coworkers5 performed experimental work on Pt
nanotubes doped with silver. They observed that these
materials reduce the poisoning of Pt nanotubes during
the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol.
