Description:
Good ligands for metals in low oxidation states with weaker accepting properties compared to carbonyl ligands.

Text:
Similarly, to carbonyl ligands, isocyanides (CNR) are good ligands for metals in low oxidation 
states. Due to the weaker accepting properties of isocyanides in comparison with carbonyl (CO) 
ligands, there exist only very few examples of homoleptic metalisocyanide complexes with metals 
in negative oxidation states M(CNR)6 (for MV, Nb, Ta),1 Fe(CNR)42 2 and Co(CNR)4.3 In 
comparison with cyanide ligands, the donating properties of alkyl isocyanide ligands are less 
pronounced, which is a limiting factor for the stability of metal alkyl isocyanide complexes in high 
oxidation states. While thousands of molybdenum and tungsten complexes with isocyanides as coligands 
(MCNR) exist, homoleptic complexes are scarce.
