Description:
Represents an ordered vacancy where one out of every seven Mn sites is vacant.

Such redox reactions typically lead to a high driving force
to form covalent bonds, leading to structural rearrangements, resulting in voltage hysteresis,
voltage fading, and capacity losses.8 One material exhibits highly reversible highvalent redox
with negligible hysteresis and specific capacities exceeding 200 mAhg in large voltage
windows Na2Mn3O7 (NMO) where one out of every seven Mn sites is vacant (Na47Mn6717O2
where represents an ordered vacancy).915
Yamadas group was the first to experimentally verify that the high voltage capacity stemmed
from anionic redox redox reactions.13 Recent work from Abate et al.
