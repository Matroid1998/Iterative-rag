Description:
Utilized as a carbon precursor in CVD processes.

Polycrystalline SiC has been an interest of research for decades due to its high hardness, 
corrosion resistance and phase stability at elevated temperatures. Cubic silicon carbide, also 
known as 3CSiC or SiC, is often utilized as a hard protective coating because it can be 
deposited as a coating via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at moderate temperatures around 
1000 . The precursors employed in the SiC CVD can be classified into two categories. Multicomponent precursors, e.g. methyltrichlorosilane (MTS)15 and hexamethyldisilane 
(HMDS)610 can function as the source for both Si and C atoms. The alternative are CVD 
processes with separate silicon and carbon precursors, e.g., silane (SiH4) and silicon 
tetrachloride (SiCl4) are widely used Siprecursors, whereas short chain hydrocarbons, e.g. methane1115, propane14,1618, ethylene19,20 and acetylene2123, have been 
utilized as Cprecursors.
