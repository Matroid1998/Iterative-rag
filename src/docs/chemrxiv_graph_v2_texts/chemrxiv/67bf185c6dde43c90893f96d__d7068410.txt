Description:
Used in nonaqueous calcium-mediated nitrogen reduction systems.

Centralised 
ammonia production results in fertiliser inequity based on 
wealth and geography Countries which lack the capital to 
build their own HaberBosch facility or the infrastructure to 
transport ammonia tend to suffer more on the global hunger 
index.1,4 A distributed, sustainable mode of ammonia synthesis 
would be preferable, such as electrochemical ammonia synthe
sis by nitrogen reduction5. The sole examples of rigorously verified continuous elec
trochemical nitrogen reduction on a solid electrode are the 
nonaqueous lithium and calcium mediated nitrogen reduction 
systems69, which both follow the same general principle. In 
these systems, a lithium or calcium salt is used to generate an 
active surface insitu via electrodeposition in an organic, apro
tic solvent.
