Since its inception in the 1920s, computational chemistry has had a revolutionary impact on the way 
chemists perform research.1 Once limited to describing the bonding interactions of the hydrogen 
molecule,2 modern computational chemistry can accurately predict a multitude of molecular 
properties for systems containing hundreds or thousands of atoms,36 including molecular orbitals and 
their energies, molecular vibrations, electronic excited states, transition states, nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) shielding and coupling constants, and reaction pathways. Much of this explosion 
in scale was driven by the seminal works of Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham,7,8 building upon the works 
of many others,912 in developing the fast but accurate methodology that is known as density 
functional theory (DFT). Today, a plethora of computational models are available to the theoretician.
