Description:
Involved in the generation of carbon and heteroatom-bridged CDIS.

Text:
In these 
onepot procedures, iodoarenes react with nucleophilic arenes under oxidative acidic 
conditions.The synthesis of CDIS is more challenging since the arene moiety must be 
covalently connected to the iodoarene prior to cyclization. Recently, we published two 
new methods that describe the generation of carbon and heteroatombridged CDIS 
28, 29. Herein, we improved the formation of iodoarenes through a Brnsted acid
mediated FriedelCrafts reaction followed by an oxidative cyclization to form the 
desired CDIS 1 (Scheme 1, A). This onepot approach is based on orthoiodinated 
benzyl alcohols as starting materials. It allows access to a variety of otherwise tedious 
to synthesize CDIS robustly in short reaction times.
