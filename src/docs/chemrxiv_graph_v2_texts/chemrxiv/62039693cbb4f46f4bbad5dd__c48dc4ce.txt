Pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane energetics and inhibits 
membrane transport function in mycobacterium tuberculosis 5. Silymarin, a standardized 
extract of milk thistle seeds also known as Silybium marianum which reduces the dysfunction of 
liver while maintains the glycemic control 6. It is an effective antioxidant which prevents the 
further creation of free radicals by inactivating catalysts, removing the superoxide anion by 
converting to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and hinders the lipid synthesis 7,8. Ubiquitous 
use of pyrazine in perfume industry, baked food items and in pharmaceutical industry is 
responsible for the high interest in the compound 9,10. The family of pyrazine compounds act 
as photosystem (PS) 2 inhibitors by hindering the photosynthetic electron transport chain in 
plants, which plays a vital role in ATP production 1115.
