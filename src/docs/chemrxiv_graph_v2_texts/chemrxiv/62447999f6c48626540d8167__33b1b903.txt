Description:
Formed through COx hydrogenation involving higher hydrocarbons.

Text:
The methanation reaction set the basis for similar reactions based on COx 
10 
hydrogenation, which involve the formation of higher hydrocarbons 1012 or alcohols 13,14. 11 
In the overarching concept hydrogenation of CO2 or CO towards methane is performed utilizing 
12 
H2 produced with electrolysis of water. In a broader perspective, the PtG process can be 
13 
extended to the production of various hydrocarbons relevant for the use in the energy sector 
14 
or in the chemical value chain via the more general PowertoX approach 15. Already in 1902 
15 
Sabatier et al. discovered that methane is formed on Ni based catalysts according to the 
16 
stoichiometric eqs. (1) and (2) 16.
