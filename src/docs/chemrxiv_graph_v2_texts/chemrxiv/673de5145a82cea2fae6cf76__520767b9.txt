Description:
A low abundance element that limits widespread adoption of certain materials.

Text:
The current industrystandard materials for
low and hightemperature applications are based on Bi2Te3 (ZT
1 from 350450 K,2 ZT up to 1.9 reported for nanostructured
(Bi1xSbx)Te3 alloys10,11) and PbTe (ZT up to 2.2 at 915 K with
endotaxial nanostructuring12). However, the low abundance of
Te precludes widespread adoption, and thus alternatives com
posed of more abundant elements are critical.2
The discovery of high ZT in orthorhombic SnSe (up to 2.6 in
single crystals13 and 3.1 in polycrystalline samples14) has led to
considerable interest in the group IVVI sulphides and selenides.
