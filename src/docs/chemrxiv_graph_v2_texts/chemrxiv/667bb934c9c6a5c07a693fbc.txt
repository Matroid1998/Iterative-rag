Description:
A polyelectrolyte used on surfaces in microfluidic channels for binding and releasing protons.

Strategies to rationally encode, process and integrate chemical signals akin regulatory networks in a living 
cell, however, remains elusive.8 
Theory suggests that placing components of CRNs on a surface could create local feedback loops 
capable of dynamic and spatial aspects of intracellular communication.911 Among other approaches that 
focus on surfacedriven methods to engineer chemical communication,12 we recently reported a 
microfluidic strategy that could bestow an acidbase network with the capacity of signal transduction.13 
Briefly, fixating a polyelectrolyte (or more specifically, polyLlysine, PLL) on a surface in a microfluidic 
channel allowed us to work under flow so that the lysine residues can bind and release protons at the 
liquidsurface interface. The introduction of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs)14,15 enhanced the rate of
