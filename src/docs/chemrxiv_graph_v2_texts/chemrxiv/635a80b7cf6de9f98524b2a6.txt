Description:
A commonly used dipolar aprotic solvent with a large dipole moment.

Text:
Acetonitrile (CH3CN, ACN) is one of the most commonly used dipolar aprotic solvents, and
is used extensively both in basic research and in industry. In the gas phase, the ACN molecule
has a large dipole moment of 3.92 D1 and polarization eects are expected to increase the
dipole moment in the liquid signicantly.2 This leads to a relatively large dielectric constant
and results in high solubility of electrolytes. As a result, ACN is widely used in batteries.3,4
In the solid phase, the monoclinic ACN crystal is the most stable structure5 in which the
molecules are oriented in an antiparallel alignment in the plane spanned by the b and c axes,
while there is mainly dispersion interactions between the molecules in the a direction(see
g. 1).
