Description:
A compound that undergoes surface reconstruction to amorphous CoOOH following Sr dissolution and oxygen-vacancy formation.

Text:
The implication of these studies is that prior rationalization of high activity based on bulk 
electronics of the pristine BSCF alone failed to capture the real properties of the surfaceactive phase which 
has different oxidation states, composition, protonation state, and local structure  the active surface phase 
is in this case a completely different material. Markovic and coworkers showed that in a series of La1xSrxCoO3 compounds, surface 
reconstruction to amorphous CoOOH was observed following Sr dissolution and oxygenvacancy 
formation measured with online inductivelycoupledplasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) and identical
location transmission electron microscopy (ILTEM) analyses. They further showed that this amorphous
