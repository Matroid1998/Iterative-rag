Description:
The most abundant aromatic molecule produced on an industrial scale from lignin.

Text:
Catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) is considered to be a promising technology for 
upgrading biomass into fuels and valuable chemicals in the presence of multiphase 
catalysts 1. Lignin accounts for 10  35  by weight and up to 40  of the energy in 
biomass feedstocks 2,As one of the lignocellulosic biomass fractions can be used 
directly in the production of alkanes 3, 4. Vanillin is currently the most abundant 
aromatic molecule produced on an industrial scale from lignin, and is one of the few 
renewable resources that can be easily catalyzed to obtain alkanes5.

Description:
A lignin model compound that can be upgraded to value-added compounds by catalytic hydrogenation.

Text:
The hydrogenation 
of vanillin as a lignin model has been a hot topic of research in the catalysis 
community.6 Vanillin has the potential to be upgraded to valueadded compounds by 
catalytic hydrogenation and its valuable hydrogenation products are typically vanillyl 
alcohol (VA) and 4methyl guaiacol (MMP). During the subsequent processing of bio
oils, thermally unstable compounds such as aldehydes, acids and sugars tend to cause 
catalyst coking and need to be converted to stable compounds (e.g.

Description:
A compound that undergoes hydrodeoxygenation catalyzed by Pd to produce MMP.

Text:
The noble metal catalyst Pd has excellent hydrodeoxygenation ability for 
vanillin, e.g. PdCN N15 can produce more than 99 MMP under relatively mild
