Description:
A small alkyl group traditionally used as a substituent in allylic alkylation reactions.

Text:
Palladiumcatalyzed decarboxylative asymmetric allylic alkylation (DAAA, Scheme 1) is a mild, 
but powerful tool for the synthesis of compounds possessing quaternary stereocentres.1,2 The 
DAAA reaction has been developed to give high levels of both yields and enantioselectivities using 
allyl enol carbonate and keto allyl ester substrates (Scheme 1A).35 While the substrate class and 
allyl substitution pattern has been extensively varied, the identity of the substituent (R in Scheme 
1A) has been much less studied. Traditionally, this is a small alkyl group such as a methyl or ethyl, 
or a substituted methyl such as a benzyl group.
