Description:
Compounds used as acceptor groups in NIR TADF molecules.

Text:
For most of the 
reported NIR TADF molecules, derivatives of pyrazine,4 boronnitrogen compounds,3d, 5 and 
difluoroboron compounds,6 have been used as acceptor groups, whereas derivatives of 
triarylamine moieties,7 phenazine,8 phenothiazine,9 and phenoxazine (PXZ)10 have been 
employed as donors. Among several reported nitrogendoped polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (NPAHs), dibenzoa,cphenazine (BP) has been one of the most popular for 
achieving orangetored emission (Figure S1). Zhao et al. first reported a BP based TADF compound by combining one to three 9,9
dimethylacridan (DMAC) donors to produce a family of red TADF emitters. A distinct TADF 
character was observed particularly in 3DMACBP, an emitter with three DMAC donors, 
which showed a PL at 605 nm (in toluene) and 590 nm (in 20 wt doped films in mCBP).
