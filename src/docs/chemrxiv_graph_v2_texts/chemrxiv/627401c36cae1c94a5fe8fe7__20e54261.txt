Description:
Investigated as an incapacitating agent by the US military and found to produce a twofold greater degree of ataxia in dogs compared to 9THC.

Text:
THC acetates are semisynthetic psychoactive cannabinoids obtained via acetylation of the cannabinoid 
phenol moiety.1 The acetylation reaction is analogous to that used for the transformation of morphine 
to heroin,2 to afford increased lipophilicity and blood brain barrier permeability.3 9THC acetate (9
THCOAc, or THCO in some sources, Figure 1) had been investigated as an incapacitating agent by the US 
military as part of the Edgewood Arsenal experiments between 1949 and 1975 and was found to 
produce a twofold greater degree of ataxia in dogs compared to 9THC.4 Recent anecdotal reports 
from users state that 9THCOAc has significantly more psychoactive potency (ca. 300  more) than 
THC. The legal status of 9THCOAc is currently unclear.
