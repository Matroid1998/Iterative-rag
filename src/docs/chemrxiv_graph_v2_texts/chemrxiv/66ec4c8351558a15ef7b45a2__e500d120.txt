Description:
Exhibit enhanced metabolic stability compared to Oglycosidic bonds.

Text:
Native sugars represent one of the most abundant classes of natural products, exhibiting a multitude of 
biological functions. Unsurprisingly, functionalized carbohydrates and their conjugates based on both 
mono and oligosaccharides have found numerous applications in biochemistry, molecular biology, and 
medicine, in particular, for the development of new pharmaceutical and diagnostic agents.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 The 
synthetic efforts towards modified native sugars have traditionally focused on the regioselective 
functionalization of carbohydrate hydroxy groups8,9 and the stereoselective synthesis of functionalized O
glycosides.10,11,12 Subsequently, the lability of Oglycosidic bond under enzymatic conditions has 
stimulated the development of synthetic methods towards Cglycosides, which typically exhibit 
enhanced metabolic stability.13,14,15,16 Considerable efforts were also put fourth towards the synthesis of 
nontypical Cfunctionalized sugars (Fig.
