Description:
A strong oxidant formed from the reaction of a carbon-centered radical with molecular oxygen.

Text:
The proposed mechanism is that an aqueous electron generated 
from water radiolysis reacts with an organochloride to form a chloride ion and a carbon
centred radical. The radical reacts with dissolved molecular oxygen to form a peroxyl 
radical, which is a strong oxidant. The results show that the oxidation depends on the 
concentration of organochloride higher concentration of organochloride leads to more 
pronounced oxidation. We hypothesize that the molar ratio of dissolved oxygen to 
organochloride affects the yield of the peroxyradical, since oxygen can compete with 
organochloride to react with aqueous electrons.17 
In this work, we propose a reaction network which includes key reactions of the pathway 
of peroxylradical formation.
