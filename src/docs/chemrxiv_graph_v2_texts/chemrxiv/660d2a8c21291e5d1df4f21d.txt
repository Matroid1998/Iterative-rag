Description:
Identified as a promising alternative to canonical Pd catalysis.

1A).1b In the 50 years since its discovery, many iterations of ligands 
 mainly Pbased  have appeared, which improved the reactivity for 
more challenging amines and aryl halides.1b In recent years, 
alternatives to canonical Pd catalysis have appeared in the literature, 
identifying Cu and Ni as one of the most promising alternatives.3 Yet, 
the mechanistic framework of M0MII catalytic cycles based on complex 
phosphine or NHC ligands still dominated (Fig. 1A).4 In 2016, 
Buchwald and MacMillan provided a new platform that permitted facile 
CN bond formation merging photoredox and nickel catalysis (Fig. 1B),5 avoiding the design and multistep synthesis of supporting 
ligands.
