Description:
Plays a vital physiological role through GABA receptors.

Their 
biological functions are varied and include acting as both agonists and antagonists on mammalian 
neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system.12 
The final characteristic is specifically linked to GABA (aminobutyric acid, 1), which is the 
primary inhibitory transmitter in mammals central nervous systems and plays a vital physiological 
role through GABA receptors.3 Serious neurological disorders like Parkinsons or Huntingtons 
disease, epilepsy, and other psychiatric disorders including pain or anxiety are linked to GABA 
deficiency.4 Unfortunately, the conventional administration of GABA supplements via oral or 
intravenous means has limited therapeutic efficacy because of its low lipophilicity, which makes it 
difficult for it to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier.
