MetalLigandCooperativity has been a key concept for the development of homogeneous catalyst for novel atom 
economic and sustainable reactions with molecular substrates in the last two decades. Recent advancements of such 
metalligandcooperative catalysis particularly involve hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and dehydrogenative coupling 
reactions as well as hydrogen borrowingtype reactions.1,2,1113,310 These important developments were also applied for 
the synthesis of polyesters1416 and amides1720 by dehydrogenative coupling, as well as for alternative strategies for the 
recycling of polyester,2124 amides25,26 and urethanes26 by hydrogenation (Fig. 1 A), but the huge number of catalytic 
hydrogen borrowing type protocols in organic synthesis have never been applied to polymers (Fig.
