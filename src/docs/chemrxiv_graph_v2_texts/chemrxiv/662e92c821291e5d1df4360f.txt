Description:
A component of lithium-ion battery systems involved in electrolyte decomposition and degradation reactions at the anode-electrolyte interface.

Text:
Abinitio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are in principle wellsuited for this task
but they have a major limitation with respect to the accessible simulation timescale.911
It is therefore of interest to seek an efficient, physically motivated and simple framework to
incorporate chemical reactions to classical MD simulations.12,13 The aim of this work is to
demonstrate the use of the reactive step MD (rsmd)14,15 framework in the context of mod
eling electrolyte decomposition and degradation reactions occurring at the anodeelectrolyte
interface of Lithiumion battery systems (LIBs).1,2 rsmd is a framework aimed for enabling
the occurrence of bondbreaking and formation within classical MD simulations by means
of timedependent modifications of classical forcefields. This framework was introduced in
