lenge associated with fragment screening is the requirement 
for highly sensitive screening technologies to detect weak frag
mentprotein interactions.26 Historically, fragment screening 
has relied upon NMR monitoring techniques and surface plas
mon resonance (SPR), but these approaches are often resource 
intensive.27 Furthermore, methods for hit validation and bind
ing site identification (e.g. structural studies) are then required 
to enable the appropriate triaging and optimisation of frag
ment hits. Evolution of next generation fragment screening 
technologies would facilitate more rapid discovery of protein 
ligands.
