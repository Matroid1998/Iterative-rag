Description:
Compounds can be calculated using molecular orbitals with a spinfree relativistic Hamiltonian.

Text:
However, accurate descriptions of their electronic states require highly 
precise relativistic treatment and electron correlation treatment on the same footing. Particularly, 
static electron correlation may be more pronounced due to the involvement of actinides 5f and 6d 
orbitals in chemical bonding, because these orbitals are located energetically close to each other. One of the most practical and less computationally intensive approaches to calculating 
actinide compounds is constructing molecular orbitals (MOs) with a spinfree (SF) relativistic 
Hamiltonian. In such cases, spinorbit (SO) interactions are considered later by taking a linear 
combination of SF multielectronic states simultaneously with electron correlation calculations. Thus far, coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD),2 multireference configuration interaction 
(MRCI),3 and multireference secondorder perturbation theory (MRPT2)4 have been applied to 
this approach.
