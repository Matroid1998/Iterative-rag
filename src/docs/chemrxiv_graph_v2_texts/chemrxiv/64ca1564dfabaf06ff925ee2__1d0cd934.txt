Description:
Complexes with electronic structures that are subject to debate due to the noninnocent nature of NO as a ligand.

Text:
The electronic structures of transition metal nitrosyls have long been the subject of lively 
interest, debate, and controversy.1,2,3 The crux of the problem is that NO, as a paradigmatic 
noninnocent ligand, does not allow a simple determination of the oxidation state of a metal 
center it is attached to.4,5 According to current chemical nomenclature, oxidation states are 
defined in terms of the ionic approximation (IA), whereby the two electrons of a heteronuclear 
bond, are both assigned to the more electronegative side.6,7,8 For NO complexes, the strongly 
covalent nature of metal(d)NO(p) interactions often interferes with the application of the IA.
