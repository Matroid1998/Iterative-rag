Description:
An important variant of glycidol.

Text:
One could foresee installation of this fragment from an 
(S)glycidol derivative, and not surprisingly many of the 
current pretomanid routes make use of functionalized 
glycidols.2 
Glycidyl pivalate appears to be a particularly important 
variant.3 Enantiomers of optically active glycidol are of 
considerable expense, however, construction from less 
expensive precursors would be desirable. Epichlorohydrin 
is a feedstock chemical, and its pure enantiomers are highly 
available in comparison to those of glycidol. As a result, 
(R)epichlorohydrin is approximately 56 of the cost4 of 
(S)glycidol and could thus form the basis for a more cost
effective route to this intermediate. Figure 1 Pretomanid retrosynthesis from protected glycidols.
