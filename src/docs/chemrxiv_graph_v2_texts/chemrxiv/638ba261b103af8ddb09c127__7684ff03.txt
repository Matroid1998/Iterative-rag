Description:
Involved in CO2 reduction processes.

Text:
Photochemistry is an effective means by which strained, energydense compounds can be 
accessed while facilitating green chemistry through mild reaction conditions. Gasevolving 
reactions produce gases such as oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO2) and are utilized for processes 
such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO2 reduction. Photochemical decarbonylation 
has been utilized to promote crosscoupling and form biaryl compounds1, promote synthetic 
pathways towards strained compounds such as tetrahedrane2, 3, and facilitate transitionmetal
catalyzed CC bond cleavage.46 Small concentrations of CO have been shown to have therapeutic 
effects, including it being used as an antiinflammatory agent,7 and used to treat cancer and 
bacterial infections.710 CO delivery can be lightactivated with a photoactive COreleasing
