Description:
The main nonprotein thiol in living cells, involved in metabolism and antioxidant defense.

Text:
Biological thiols, such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), and homocysteine (Hcy), are essential 
for preserving the proper redox state of biological processes. GSH, a tripeptide of glutamate, 
cysteine, and glycine, is the main nonprotein thiol in living cells. For healthy individuals, cellular 
concentrations of GSH range from 0.5 to 10 mM, and its concentrations in physiological fluids are 
approximately 2 to 12 M1. GSH has several important cellular functions related to metabolism, 
antioxidant defense, regulation of intracellular redox status, protein glutathionylation, as well as 
mitochondrial function and integrity2. Abnormal concentration levels of GSH are associated to 
various diseases including oxidative stress resulting in cancer3, neurotoxicity4, heart problems5, 
Alzheimers6, aging related deseases7.
