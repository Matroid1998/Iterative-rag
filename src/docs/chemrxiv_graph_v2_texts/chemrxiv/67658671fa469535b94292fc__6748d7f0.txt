is the preferred (and possibly only1618) cosubstrate, making LP
MOs the first copper enzymes known to carry out a peroxygenase
reaction.14
A complicating factor for the elucidation of the LPMO mech
anism has been that LPMOs, in absence of polysaccharide sub
strate, can generate H2O2 from O2 (oxidase reactivity).19,20 Only
a reductant must be present as any LPMO activity requires an
initial priming reduction of the activesite Cu(II) to Cu(I).21
The oxidase activity is commonly measured in experimental stud
ies, showing that multiple LPMO families with different substrate
specificity generate H2O2 and that the rates of H2O2 production
can differ considerably between LPMO families but even within
the same family.22 Under typical experimental conditions where
no exogenous H2O2 is added, substrate oxidation may rely on
this in situ generation of H2O2, and it is thus possible that the
H2O2 production may be rate determining.15,22,23 However, ex
cess H2O2 can lead to oxidative damage and inactivation of LP
MOs, especially when the substrate is absent or only present
in low concentrations.15 Therefore, understanding the detailed
mechanism of H2O2 generation is crucial for controlling LPMO
activity and avoiding enzyme inactivation.
