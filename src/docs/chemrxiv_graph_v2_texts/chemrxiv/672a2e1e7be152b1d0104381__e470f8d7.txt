Description:
An important oxygen-containing heterocyclic system found in natural products and drugs.

Text:
Benzobpyran, or chroman, is one of the most important oxygen
containing heterocyclic systems found in numerous natural 
products, as well as marketed and investigational drugs.110 
Among them, 2substituted chromans are especially notable their 
naturally occurring representatives include tocopherols (vitamin 
E), tetrahydrocannabinols, and various 2arylchroman (flavan) 
derivatives, e.g., apiforol and luteoforol (Figure 1, A). Many classic 
studies in this area are related to 2arylchromane derivatives, a 
subclass of flavonoid natural products. With an increased interest 
to sp3enriched compounds (i.e., those having higher fraction of 
sp3hybrid carbon atoms) in drug discovery observed in the last 
decades,1113 2((hetera)cyclo)alkylchromanes and their spiro
cyclic analogs become very promising chemotypes and synthetic 
targets. Some of them have already paved their way to medicinal
