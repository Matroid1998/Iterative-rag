Description:
Analogues with xanthene ring modified by varying bridging groups.

Text:
These heterocy
cles have found use in organic electronics as acceptor units9 in 
building blocks for thermally activated delayed fluorescence 
emitters, in particular in challenging recent applications such as 
phosphorescent10 and circularly polarized OLEDs.11
