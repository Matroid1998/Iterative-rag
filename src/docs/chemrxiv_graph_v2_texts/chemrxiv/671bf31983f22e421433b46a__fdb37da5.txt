Description:
Elements capable of forming perovskites, located in the same periodic table column as oxygen.

Oxide 
perovskitesanother class of perovskites which has an oxygen 
atom at the Xsitehave been studied for several decades and 
show incredible stability, but their bandgaps are much too high 
for conventional optoelectronic applications, especially for PVs. Moving down the column from oxygen on the periodic table are 
the remaining chalcogens. Also capable of forming perovskites, 
this leads us to the chalcogenide perovskites (CPs). Aptly 
named, these perovskites take a divalent chalcogen, usually S2 
or Se2, on the X site, while the A and B sites predominantly 
contain alkaline earth (AE) metals Ca2, Sr2, or Ba2, and Group 
IV transition metals (IVB) Ti4, Zr4, or Hf4, respectively, to 
maintain charge balance and structural tolerance factors.
