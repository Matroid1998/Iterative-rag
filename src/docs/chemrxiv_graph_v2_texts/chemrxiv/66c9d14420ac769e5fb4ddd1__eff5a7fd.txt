Description:
A mineral that is a representative member of a group of zeolites.

Natrolite, Na2(Si3Al2)O102H2O, is a mineral that was named by M. H. Klaproth, 1803, from Greek 
natron, for its sodium content and lithos, that is stone (Strekeisen, 2020). Natrolite is the 
representative member of a group of zeolites, where zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals 
made from interlinked tetrahedra of alumina (AlO4) and silica (SiO4) (Strekeisen, 2020). The origin 
of the name zeolite, as reported by Strekeisen, is very interesting too. It is told that the term zeolite 
was proposed by A. F. Cronstedt in 1756, since he observed that upon rapidly heating the material 
stilbite, it produced large amounts of steam (Strekeisen, 2020). Therefore, Cronstedt used Greek 
zeo, to boil, and lithos.

Description:
A member of the natrolite group found in the RRUFF database.

Text:
Due to their structure, zeolites have channels, through which water and 
large ions (such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium) can travel into and out of the crystal 
structure (Strekeisen, 2020); the size of molecules or ions is controlled by size of channels, and 
zeolites can act as a chemical sieve. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these 
materials the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This 
is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions (Strekeisen, 2020). In RRUFF database, we find the members of the natrolite group as natrolite, mesolite, scolecite, and 
gonnardite. In this database, Raman spectra are provided, where we can easily observe the OH
stretching region of water.
