Description:
Monolayer surface alloys formed by Ag deposition on Pt(111) and subsequent annealing.

Text:
The structure, formation and stability of PtAgPt(111) surface alloys had been characterized previously 
by a variety of different techniques,2932 the results were summarized previously by Jankowski et al. 33 
and by Bauer et al.34 These studies found that deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on Pt(111) 
and subsequent annealing to about 620 K results in the formation of monolayer PtAg surface alloys, 
where the Ag atoms are confined to the topmost layer 24,29,30,32 with a tendency to phase separation to 
form twodimensional, homoatomic ensembles rather than a random distribution.25 Thermal and CO 
induced intermixing of Pt and Ag in Ag films on Pt(111) and in Pt film covered Ag(111) surfaces were 
investigated by Jankowski et al. 33 experimentally and by Hua et al.
