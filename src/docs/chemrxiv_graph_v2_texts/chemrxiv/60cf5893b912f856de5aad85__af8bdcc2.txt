Description:
Codoped with BiCuSeO to enhance its thermoelectric performance.

Text:
ptype BiCuSeO is one of the most promising thermoelectric (TE)
materials for midtemperature applications,1 reaching a maxi
mum TE gure of merit (zT) of 1.5 at 823 K when codoped
with Ca and Pb.2 The high zT is, in part, due to the high ther
mopower (350 VK at room temperature)1 as well as the in
trinsically low lattice thermal conductivity ( 1 WmK) arising
from its low Youngs modulus3,4 and strong anharmonicity.5 As a
result, BiCuSeO has attracted, and continues to inspire, a myriad
of studies to further improve its TE performance.1,68
Tuning of the charge carrier (hole, electron) concentrations is
needed to optimize the p or ntype TE performance of materi
als.9 For BiCuSeO, doping efforts have almost exclusively been
limited to optimizing the hole carrier concentration because the
asgrown material is natively ptype.
