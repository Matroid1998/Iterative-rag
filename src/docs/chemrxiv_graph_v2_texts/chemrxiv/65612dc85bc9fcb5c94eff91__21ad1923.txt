Description:
Functional materials derived from the polymerization of elemental sulfur.

To realize these benefits, 
readily accessible polymers that respond to such lowpower irradiation are required. Addressing these needs, this study describes the modification of lowcost polymers made 
from elemental sulfur and either cyclopentadiene or dicyclopentadiene using low power 
continuous wave lasers with wavelengths of 532, 638, 690, and 786 nm. Polymers made from 
elemental sulfur have received increasing attention with the advent of inverse vulcanization8 
and related polymerization methods912 that convert this abundant and inexpensive feedstock 
into functional polysulfide materials.
