Description:
Substrates that show a much higher affinity toward Sirt2 than acetylated substrates.

Text:
The binding of longchain acyllysine substrates, which show 
a much higher affinity toward Sirt2 than acetylated substrates, induces the formation of a hydrophobic, 
Sirt2 specific subpocket at the end of the acyllysine channel.9,10 In 2015, our group first identified this 
pocket and termed it selectivity pocket, in the course of the discovery of the Sirt2selective inhibitor 
SirReal2 (Figure 1B).22 SirReal2 opens this pocket primarily through the reorientation of the hinge 
region consisting of amino acids 138143 and further locks Sirt2 in a catalytically inactive opened 
state. The inhibitor class was further improved towards more potent scaffolds, especially with the 
implementation of a triazole residue that forms specific interactions with Arg97 that led to increased 
affinities (e.g., Mz242, Figure 1B).
