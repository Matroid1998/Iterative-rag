Description:
A type of structure studied for color, with colors ranging from turquoise to dark green depending on manganese content.

Text:
The YIn1xMnxO3 series has also been 
shown to have excellent nearinfrared reflectance and show potential as cool pigments for use 
to reflect solar heat such as roofing materials 14. However, the cost associated with indium
based precursors causes an issue with these compositions. Other Mncontaining compounds have also been studied for their colour such as 
brownmillerite and apatite type structures, although these colours tend to range from 
turquoise to dark green depending on manganese content 1519. The apatite material has 
the general formula A10(MO4)6X2 where typically A  Ca, Sr, Ba or La, M Si, Ge, P or V and X  
O, OH or halides 2023.

Description:
A structure classed as an A4(MO4)6 framework with flexibility for doping, leading to properties like high ionic conductivity and luminescence.

Text:
The apatite structure can be classed as an A4(MO4)6 framework which 
contains A cations (A1 site) in trigonal metaprisms that are cornerlinked with the tetrahedral 
MO4 units. The remaining A cations (A2 site) and X anions are located within the cavities of 
this framework (Figure 1). The apatite structure shows excellent flexibility for doping on the 
different sites, and such doping strategies can lead to a variety of properties, such as high ionic 
conductivity and luminescence 2325. The use of different dopants can also change the 
colour of apatites. Previously, apatite pigments have been made by doping with transition 
metals, with the colours observed attributed to dd transitions or to charge transfer bands.
