Description:
A photoproduct of transresveratrol excitation, known as resveratrone.

Text:
Photoreactions are observed when trans
resveratrol is in a liquid environment but, unlike photoisomerization, they are not 
detected in the solid phase.11 An example of such a photoreaction is the 
cyclization of transresveratrol.14,15 After UV irradiation in water and ethanol 
solutions, the cyclized photoproduct 2,4,6trihydroxyphenanthrene (THP) was 
detected.11,14,15 Another photoproduct of transresveratrol excitation is (E)4(6,8
dihydroxynaphthalen2yl)but3en2one, known as resveratrone.12,16 Yang et 
al.16 This product was proposed to be formed from the cis isomer, which can 
undergo a pericyclic ring closure, followed by a photoinduced 4e cyclization and 
by a series of tautomerization steps.
