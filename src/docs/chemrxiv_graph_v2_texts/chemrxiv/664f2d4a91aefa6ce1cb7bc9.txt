Description:
Used in olefin metathesis reactions to produce propylene from PE.

The decrease in quality is further facilitated by the presence of 
different additives, such as flame retardants, pigments and 
plasticizers.8 However, new chemical recycling technologies 
based on olefin metathesis reaction which can convert PE with 
ethylene to propylene have recently been proposed as an 
important alternative and could be demonstrated by Scott and 
Guironnet,9 Hartwig10 and in our laboratories.11,12 These 
technologies offer the possibility to use polyolefin waste as a 
feedstock for the chemical industry. Moreover, the propylene 
product of this transformation is widely used in the 
petrochemical industry to provide essential chemicals and 
intermediates, e.g. polypropylene, propylene oxide, butanal, 
acrolein, acryl nitrile or isopropanol.
