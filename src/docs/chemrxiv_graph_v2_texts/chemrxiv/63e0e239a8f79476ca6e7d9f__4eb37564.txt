Description:
Mimicked by nitrogen-substituted bicyclo3.1.1heptanes.

Text:
. In 
2022, 
bicyclo3.1.1heptanes 
were 
demonstrated to mimic the fragment of metasubstituted 
benzenes in biologically active compounds. 1,2 Both cores had 
similar angles between the exit vectors (119120), a similar 
distance 
between 
substituents 
(4.85.0 
), 
and 
similar 
physicochemical properties (Scheme 1). Given our current 
interest in heterosubstituted bicycloalkanes, 3 we immediately 
became 
interested 
in 
adding 
a 
nitrogen 
atom 
to 
bicyclo3.1.1heptanes. Such systems could in theory mimic the 
fragment of pyridine and could also be additionally considered 
as nonchiral analogs of piperidines (Scheme 1). Both logics 
seemed to be interesting for medicinal chemistry applications. Having finished with a brilliant design of the target system, we 
faced a tiny problem, however we had absolutely no clue how to 
make it.

Description:
A fragment that can be replaced in the structure of antihistamine drugs like Rupatidine.

Text:
In this work, due to an unexpected observation from a side 
project, we present a general scalable approach to 3aza
bicyclo3.1.1 heptanes  saturated mimetics of pyridine. We 
have synthesized them, characterized them, and incorporated 
them into a structure on an antihistamine drug Rupatidine 
instead of the pyridine fragment.4
