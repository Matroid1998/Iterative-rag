Description:
A hydrazide which acts as a tightbinding inhibitor of enoyl reductase (InhA) and is activated by the KatG catalaseperoxidase to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.

Tuberculosis, a disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, constitutes a substantial health concern
that affects 10.3 million of the global population. Throughout the latent phase of infection,
My
cobacterium tuberculosis bacilli can endure within
granulomas for extended durations as they are
exhibiting low metabolic activity and are therefore
slow or nonreplicating. Isoniazid (INH), a hydrazide which acts as a
tightbinding inhibitor of enoyl reductase (InhA),
is the main component of current TB drugs. INH
is activated by the KatG catalaseperoxidase to
inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis. Another hy
drazine compound used against TB, thiacetazone
(TAC), undergoes activation through the action
of
monooxygenase
EthA
and
hydroxymycolate
synthase (MmaA4). This activation process alters
the structure of hydroxylacyldehydratases (HadAB,
HadBC), prominent enzymes which catalyze Mtbs
mycolic acid biosynthesis and elongation pathway.
