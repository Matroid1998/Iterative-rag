Specific initial productivities of the corresponding catalysts in the 
dehydrogenation of H18DBT at 310 C in the range of 2 to 4 gH2 gPt1 min1 were reported.2 This 
emphasizes the need for scalable synthesis routes for PtAl2O3 catalysts that allow precise control 
of the size of the platinum nanoparticles. PtAl2O3 catalysts are commonly synthesized via wet impregnation of the support with an aqueous 
Pt precursor solution.1012 This route offers several advantages, such as high dispersion of the 
metal particles and simple scalability. However, required thermal treatment during subsequent 
processing of the catalysts i.e., calcination in air at temperatures between 300 and 500 C13 or 
reduction under hydrogen atmosphere at 200 to 600 C,14 is associated with challenges.
