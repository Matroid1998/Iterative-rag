Description:
Utilized as a natural electron acceptor in oxidase-based sensors.

The most ubiquitous interference is molecular oxygen, which is difficult to avoid in pointof
use sensing due to measurements being conducted in ambient air or oxygenrich media such as 
blood (10). Oxygen can interfere with all types of oxidoreductasebased electrochemical 
biosensors through various mechanisms. For reductasebased sensors (1116), enzymatic 
analyte reduction typically requires applied electrode potentials that are more negative than the 
potential for the O2 reduction reaction. As a result, O2 is reduced directly at the electrode, 
leading to an overestimation of the analyte concentration (1216). In contrast, in oxidasebased 
sensors, the oxidase intrinsically utilize O2 as a natural electron acceptor (2).
