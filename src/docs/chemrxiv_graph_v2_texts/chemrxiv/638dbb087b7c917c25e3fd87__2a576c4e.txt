Description:
A metabolite scavenged and synthesized by Toxoplasma.

Text:
The parasite diverts a variety of lipid 
precursors from the host cytoplasm and efficiently manufacture them into complex lipids 14, the apicoplast 
fatty acid synthesis being essential for organelle biogenesis and parasite survival 18. The metabolites and 
final products that are both scavenged and synthesized by Toxoplasma comprise lipids, lipoate and isoprenoids 
(as farnesol and geranylgeraniol) 11. T. gondii is an avid scavenger of lipids retrieved from the host cell 19, 
and deprivation from essential host lipids can induce parasite starvation 14. The uncontrolled uptake of 
unsaturated fatty acids by the parasite and its vulnerability to lipid storage inhibition were suggested as 
potential strategies to restrict the parasite growth 11, 14, 19.
