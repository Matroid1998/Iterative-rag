Hydrogen production by solar water splitting (SWS) using abundant and ecofriendly photoelectrode 
materials is very appealing nowadays. The overall efficiency of SWS reaction is directly related to the 
photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity including both oxidation and reduction reactions that occur at the 
interface between photoelectrodes and the aqueous electrolyte. Hematite is the archetype semiconducting 
material used as photoanode, presenting a band gap of 2.15 eV, perfectly matching the solar spectrum for 
optimized absorption and thus for direct SWS applications.
