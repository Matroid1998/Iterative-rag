Description:
A water-soluble and nontoxic polymer used to increase bioavailability.

Text:
Using a polymeric conjugation method to increase overall stability can decrease the required dosage of a
drug, reducing the potential toxicity and adverse effects of a drug, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. For such conjugation
procedure polyethylene glycol (PEG) was chosen due to its watersoluble and nontoxic behavior as well as the increased
potential for bioavailability7. Naproxen was selected as the molecular drug which was covalently linked to PEG for
preparing NaproxenPEG ester via Steglich Esterification. Additionally, chromatographic and spectrophotometric
evaluation of drug release from naproxenPEG conjugate in various media demonstrate the capacity for extended
pharmacological effect, due to a greater release profile. 2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Materials And Methods
All materials were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, except the OTC forms of acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
