The library comprised a large portion of 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds as well as natural 
products. With the trained model, the authors identified halicin from the Drug 
Repurposing Hub as an antibacterial compound and verified its activity both in vitro 
and in vivo.18 A similar approach was utilized to discover the antibiotic abaucin which 
displayed narrowspectrum activity against Acinetobacter baumanii both in vitro and 
in vivo, highlighting that ML models can be utilized to predict both broadspectrum as 
well as narrowspectrum antibiotics.19 Recently, Capecchi et al.
