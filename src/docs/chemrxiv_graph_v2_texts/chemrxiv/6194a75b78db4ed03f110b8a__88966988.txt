Description:
Exhibits higher activities on (111) surfaces due to higher Co ion density and reactivity toward water dissociation.

Text:
Recent studies have conrmed that controlling the the
surface morphology is a promising way to improve OER
and ORR activities on transition metal oxides 2325. For example, it has been shown that Co3O4(111) sur
faces exhibits higher activities than other surface ter
minatons, probably as a consequence of its higher Co
ion density and higher reactivity toward water dissoci
