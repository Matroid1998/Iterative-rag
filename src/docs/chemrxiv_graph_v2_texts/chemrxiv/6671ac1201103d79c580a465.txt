Description:
A resource involved in circulation based on chemical recycling of polymeric materials.

Text:
Marine pollution caused by plastic waste and the threat of future depletion of fossil resources 
have forced fundamental changes in the polymer materials that humans have developed over the 
past 100 years. For example, carbon resource circulation based on chemical recycling of polymeric 
materials is recognized as the most important issue to ensure sustainability.1,2 Chemical recycling 
is a resource circulation method that consists of polymer degradation into monomers and 
repolymerization. Since the recovery of highpurity monomers provides highquality recycled 
polymers, chemical recycling is recognized as an ideal resource circulation scheme for polymer 
materials.
