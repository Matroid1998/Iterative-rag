Description:
Efficient CO2 reduction reaction catalysts due to their electronic structures and tunable ligand environments.

Graphene and MoS2 are good candidates for strain 
engineering because they are relatively large (mm) in size. However, strain induction for sub2 
nm materials is challenging due to the mismatch of lateral size with supports and difficulties in 
material transfer. Molecular complexes such as metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are efficient CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts because of their electronic structures and the tunable ligand 
environments surrounding the active sites5. However, these molecules along with most other 
molecular catalysts primarily reduce CO2 to CO; catalysts that selectively reduce CO2 beyond CO 
are scarcely reported6,7. An early study of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) in 19848 showed a 
methanol (MeOH) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 5.
