Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key process in electrochemistry.

While applications
of semiempirical methods8,9 and machine learning10,11 could
soon alleviate this limitation in some domains, the ongoing chal
lenges in simulating electrochemical dynamics even for simple
systems (e.g. the hydrogen evolution reaction)12 suggest that
PES exploration remains unsuitable for studies of complex elec
trochemistry. When PES exploration is not used, CRNs are most commonly
constructed based on human chemical intuition. By applying
reaction templates to include only commonly observed mecha
