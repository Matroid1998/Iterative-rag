Description:
A greenhouse gas that can be captured from industrial emissions for storage to reduce emissions.

to Carbon Dioxide Capture 
The climate change crisis requires largescale human behaviour changes and the rapid deployment of 
a range of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation technologies. Among these, carbon dioxide capture 
and storage is an important technology that can reduce emissions from point sources.1 In this approach, 
CO2 is captured from gas emissions at industrial sources that may include power stations, hydrogen 
production plants, cement factories and steel factories. This is achieved using a capture material that 
selectively absorbs CO2 from the mixture of emitted gases (Figure 1). The CO2 is then collected from 
the capture material via the application of heat (andor a vacuum) and is subsequently stored in the 
ground where it can be permanently sequestered.

Description:
A gas that can be captured and removed from the atmosphere for climate change mitigation.

A closely related technology is direct air capture, 
where a capture material is instead used to capture and remove carbon dioxide directly from the 
atmosphere. If the carbon dioxide is then collected and stored securely, this technology can offer 
negative emissions, which are increasingly thought to be important in climate change mitigation 
pathways.2
