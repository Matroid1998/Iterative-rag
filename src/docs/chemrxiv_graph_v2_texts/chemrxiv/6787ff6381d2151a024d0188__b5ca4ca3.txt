Description:
A radical biocatalyst used for stereoselective synthesis of noncanonical amino acids.

Text:
Since 2023, using dual photobiocatalysis, our group has been ad
vancing pyridoxal radical biocatalysis as a new platform for the ste
reoselective synthesis of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs), which 
are essential building blocks of peptide therapeutics,5557 here bioac
tive natural products 58 and functional unnatural proteins.5964 By re
purposing biotechnologically useful twoelectron PLP enzymes6567 
to catalyze singleelectron transformations, pyridoxal radical 
biocatalysis allows the assembly of ncAAs via radicalmediated CC 
coupling with excellent stereoselectivity.48 Traditional chemical syn
thesis of ncAAs typically requires multistep protecting group manip
ulations for the amino and carboxylate moieties to ensure selective 
and efficient transformations.68 In contrast, pyridoxal radical bio
catalysis affords a protectinggroupfree and convergent strategy for 
the preparation of ncAAs using abundant and inexpensive natural 
amino acid substrates and easily available radical precursors such as 
organoboron reagents.
