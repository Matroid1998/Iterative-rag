Description:
Compounds that can exhibit subtle conformational preferences.

Glycoscience is an important emerging area with potential applications from personalized 
medicines and food security, to biofuels and advanced biomaterials.2 Key to the rational design 
of carbohydratebased compounds is the ability to accurately understand their conformational 
behavior.3 Achieving this, however, can be challenging as carbohydrates can exhibit subtle 
conformational preferences. In this regard, the use of computational methods have proven useful; 
in particular, the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is capable of providing 
conformational landscapes in atomistic detail not readily accessible via experimental approaches. For example, conformational analysis of the core pentasaccharide derived from the 
lipooligosaccharide of pathogenic bacterium Moraxella catarrhalis was recently performed 
using molecular simulation and NMR.
