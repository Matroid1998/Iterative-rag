Description:
A tetrahedrally coordinated atom present in the structure of zeolites.

Text:
Double fourring cages (d4r units, face symbol 46, tcub tile in the nomenclature of natural til
ings1) are a prototypical building unit of zeolites and zeotypes. A recent statistical analysis of the 
zeolite frameworks included in the IZA (International Zeolite Association) Database of Zeolite 
Structures2 showed that the tcub tile is the second most frequent tile, occurring in 36 out of 239 
zeolite frameworks.3 As d4r units consist of fourmembered rings, the TOT angles (where T  
tetrahedrally coordinated atom such as Si, Ge, Al, P, ) along the edges are relatively small, typi
cally below 140 degrees.
