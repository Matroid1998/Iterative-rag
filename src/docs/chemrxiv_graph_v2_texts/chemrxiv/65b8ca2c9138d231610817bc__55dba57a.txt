Aqueoussoluble organic energystoring molecules, benefiting from structural diversity and 
the earthabundance of their atomic components, may permit scalable, safe, costeffective long duration 
energy storage in aqueous redox flow batteries.57 
From the cost perspective, one of the promising energystorage molecular families is that of 
anthraquinone derivatives811 , such as 2,6dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ2 or DHAQ for simplicity)12, 
whose cost is low at a mass production scale (4kg).13 However, the main challenge of utilizing DHAQ 
as the negolyte (negative electrolyte) species is its fast decomposition rate caused by the instability of 
reduced DHAQ (DHAQ4). The decomposition mechanism of DHAQ4 has been identified, and two
