Text:
Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are pivotal in 
chemical and biochemical processes.12 In contrast to elec
tron transfer and energy transfer mechanisms, HAT offers 
a distinctive advantage by overcoming the constraints of 
redox potentials, thereby activating substrates under mild 
conditions in organic transformations.

Description:
Involved in hydrogen atom transfer processes in photocatalysis.

HAT in photocataly
sis has two approaches indirect hydrogen atom transfer 
(iHAT) and direct hydrogen atom transfer (dHAT).1, 3 In 
the iHAT process, a photocatalyst is excited upon light 
absorption to generate radical or radical ion species as 
hydrogen abstractors through electron transfer events, for 
example, reduction of persulfate (S2O82) to a sulfate radi
cal anion (SO4)4 and oxidation of thiol (RSH) to thiyl rad
ical (RS).56 In comparison, the dHAT process directly 
abstracts a hydrogen atom from a substrate molecule by an 
excited photocatalyst, forming a radical intermediate and 
the Hdoped form of the photocatalyst (PCH) (Figure 
1a). The prevalent structural motif in dHAT photocatalysts 
features an oxo group, endowing them with a distinctive 
oxygencentered radical character in their reactive excited 
states for hydrogen abstraction.
