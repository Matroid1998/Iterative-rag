Description:
A source of calcium sulfate added to act as a set retarding agent.

Text:
This phenomenon, known as a flash set, is attributed to the formation of
28
AFm phases (C2AH8 and C4AH13), which form as platelets, causing rapid stiffening of the paste 4, 6. 29
Over time, the metastable AFm phases undergo partial or complete transformation into the more stable
30
hydrate phase katoite (or hydrogarnet, C3AH6) 711. 31
Calcium sulfate sources like gypsum or anhydrite are added during clinker grinding to act as set
32
retarding agents 12, 13. This addition not only slows down the initial C3A reaction, thereby preventing
33
a flash set but also redirects the hydration pathway of C3A towards ettringite formation 10, 14.
