Description:
Indispensable in medicinal chemistry, with a significant presence in FDA-approved new molecular entities.

Text:
Sulfonamides are indispensable in medicinal chemistry. 25  of all FDAapproved new molecular entities from the 
first half of 2022 contained a sulfonamide motif.1 Moreover, 
sulfonamide analogs, especially the O to NR exchanged 
sulfonimidamides (see Fig. 1) and sulfoximines, have gained 
substantial momentum13 and first successful examples 
show the potential of these modalities.47 Notably, the new 
exit vector enabled by sulfonimidamides may open unprec
edented opportunities for structurebased design of sulfon
amide analogs, but structurally welldocumented examples 
for this are still lacking. 1 www.accessdata.fda.govscriptscderdafindex.cfm?eventreports

Description:
Compounds with a sulfonamide motif, often found in cocrystal structures.

Text:
In line with the prevalence of sulfonamides, over 1,000 
cocrystal structures are available in the PDB harboring sul
fonamidecontaining ligands.2 However, the contribution of 
the sulfonamide motif to affinity is usually poorly defined 
and little is known regarding the interaction energies re
sulting from the sulfonamide oxygenprotein contacts. SMILES; Match Type Substructure (including Stereoiso
