Description:
Involved in radical-radical reaction channels during destruction, such as homolytic dissociation within perfluoroalkyl chains.

The
difficulty in experimentally characterizing the products of incomplete combustion, which are
potentially hazardous, has prompted a variety of computational studies into the chemical
reaction mechanisms of PFAS pyrolysis and oxidation.610
Extensive examinations of the thermochemistry of species involved in the destruction of
perfluorinated carboxylic acids and perfluorinated sulfonic acids indicate that radicalradical
reaction channels, such as homolytic dissociation within perfluoroalkyl chains, are likely
important alongside molecular or pericyclic reactions with sufficiently low electronic barriers
to contribute at incineration conditions. However, in the existing theoretical studies on
PFAS thermal decomposition, the consideration of barrierless reactions has been limited.
