Description:
Derivatives generated from gemdichlorocarbene57 and unsaturated carbonyl derivatives.

Text:
spiro 2,2pentane ring is a structural fragment of many biologically active compounds1, 
including highly efficient insecticides2,3. In the recent years, strong physiological activity 
has been revealed in the series of conjugated spiro 2,2pentane carboxylic acid esters 
derivatives, and interest in these compounds has increased considerably4. Almost all 
known syntheses of such rings are based on a combination of unsaturated carbonyl 
derivatives and in situ generated gemdichlorocarbene57 to generate gem
dichlorocyclopropane8,9 derivatives which further undergo annealation10 to give

spiropentane carboxylic acid derivatives. Indeed, gemdihalocyclopropane derivatives 
are useful synthetic intermediates because they can be readily transformed into cyclic, 
acyclic, heterocyclic and macrocyclic compounds including natural product precursors11
