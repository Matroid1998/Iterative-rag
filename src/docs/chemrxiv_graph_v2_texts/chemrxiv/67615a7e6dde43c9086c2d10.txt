Description:
A chromophore enabling all-red light and NIR photoswitching via direct excitation with NIR absorption up to 850 nm, large photochromism, strong color contrast, good quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the metastable state.

They include photophysical 
methods36 such as twophoton absorption,37, 38 upconversion,3945 or sensitization46, 47 as well 
as intrinsic tailoring by substitution approaches,4853 or developing novel photoswitch motives 
with suitable corechromophores altogether.5, 5464 Currently, however, there seems to be a limit 
at the 1000 nm short wavelength infrared (SWIR) boundary, beyond which viable 
photoswitching cannot feasibly be realized.4043, 53, 65 We have recently reported on the peri
anthracenethioindigo (PAT) chromophore, which enables allred light and NIR photoswitching 
via direct excitation.66 Its highly advantageous property profile includes NIR absorption up to 
850 nm, large photochromism with maxima separations of more than 140 nm, strong color 
contrast between bright green and deep blue, good quantum yields, and high thermal stability 
of the metastable state.
