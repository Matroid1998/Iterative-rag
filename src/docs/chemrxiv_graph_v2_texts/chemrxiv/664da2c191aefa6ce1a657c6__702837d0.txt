)24 One such material, Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals,
has exhibited a large potential for a broad range of optoelectronic applications, such as deepblue lightemitting
diodes (LEDs), ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors or as fluorescent inks for encryption technologies.57 While
several syntheses have been developed for these exciting nanocrystals, scalability and morphological control
over the reaction products are still major obstacles for this material class.1,8,9 Reaction temperature has
been determined to influence the nanocrystal geometry in hotinjection syntheses, with a transition from small
spheres to larger anisotropic nanorods with increasing temperature.10 In the first implementation of a fully
autonomous and self optimizing continuousflow based synthesis, the CuIprecursor concentration and reaction
temperature were determined to be the most influential parameters for the synthesis.11 While the 0D crystal
structure of the material precludes quantum confinement effects due to nanocrystal size, a dependency of the
PLQY on the size of the nanocrystals was previously observed and attributed to the number of surface defects,
highlighting the need for controlled surface coordination by ligands.9 Employing continuous flow systems for the
fabrication of semiconductor nanocrystals has the dual advantage of having more precise control over reaction
parameters and being able to screen reaction conditions significantly faster, employ more moderate reaction
conditions and lower precursor concentration due to increased heat and masstransfer as well as easily scale up
the material production due to the continuous nature of the procedure.12 In the following, we present a facile
and lowcost singlephase continuous flow approach for the synthesis of Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals.
