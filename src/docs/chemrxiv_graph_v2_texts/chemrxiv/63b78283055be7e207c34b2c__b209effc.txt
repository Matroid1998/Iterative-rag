Description:
Particularly noted for their activity in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

Redox switchable catalysis has been gaining traction over the 
past decade as a method to obtain control over polymer archi
tecture by changing electron density at either the ligand frame
work or the metal center.17 The use of external stimuli such as 
chemical redox agents or electricity to control the oxidation 
states of catalysts can be exploited to turn on and off different 
complementary catalytic reactions.811 This form of orthogonal 
reactivity has been extensively explored by our group1217 and 
others1822 in ring open polymerization of cyclic esters and 
ethers, yet there has been a limited number of attempts to ex
pand the scope of redox controlled systems.1, 7, 2333 

Nickel halide complexes, particularly nickel bromides,3436 in 
the presence of an initiator, are active radical polymerization 
systems with notable examples in atom transfer radical 
polymerization (ATRP, Figure 1a).3738 The rates of polymeriza
tion and equilibria in ATRP can be influenced via changes in the 
redox state of the supporting ligand in metal halide species.39 
While ferrocene systems in conjunction with copper have been 
previously investigated,40 the influence of the redox states of 
ferrocene on monomer activity and selectivity has not been in
vestigated.
