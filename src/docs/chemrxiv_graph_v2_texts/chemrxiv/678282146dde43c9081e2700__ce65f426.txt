Formal complexes have been studied over many decades.

and other formal Ce(IV) complexes stretches over many
decades.1,2 Another example of an felement system with contested metal ON is PuO2,
which is the subject of the present study. PuO2 is solid under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in the flourite (CaF2) struc
ture and features eightcoordinate plutonium with cubic site symmetry and four
coordinate oxygen sites. PuO2 would appear to be a straightforward case of assign
ing Pu4 and O2 formal ion charges, along with Pu(IV) and O(II) oxidation numbers
(ONs) and an openshell Pu 5f 4 electron configuration. The number of openshell elec
trons is therefore nopen  4.
