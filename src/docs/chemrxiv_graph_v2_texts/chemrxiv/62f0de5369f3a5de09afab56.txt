Description:
Involved in the adsorption isotherm at 77 K showing retention of mesoporosity.

Text:
of 21 mol g1 of 1 into the resin architecture, 
and the successful linkage between 1 and EG40 via the phenoxy 
unit of the Tyr residue was confirmed by the absence of Tyr in 
the hydrolyzed solution (Table S1). The nitrogen adsorption iso
therm at 77 K showed retention of mesoporosity in poly1 after 
functionalization (Fig. S2 and Table S2). The affinity of OTA as 
an adsorbent for poly1 was investigated by determining the ad
sorption isotherms in the liquid phase using acetonitrile as the 
initial solvent. The temperature of the solution severely affected 
the thermodynamic parameters; therefore, the temperature of the 
system was carefully controlled during the investigation.
