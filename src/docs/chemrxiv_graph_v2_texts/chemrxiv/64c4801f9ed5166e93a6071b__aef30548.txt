Description:
Measured in clinical samples for total concentration, including free and protein-bound forms.

Separation methods like highperformance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and inductively coupled plasma 
mass spectrometry are championed for their multiplexing 
capabilities and are widely utilized in analysing clinical samples 
for copper1822. However, these methods are restricted to 
measuring total copper concentration (free Cu and those bound 
to proteins) and require multiple sample preparation steps 
(including sampling, extraction, digestion, and dilution) and 
longer analysis time. On the other hand, while colorimetric 
assays23, 24 are costeffective and have a more rapid readout 
than HPLC25, they are limited by analytechromogen interaction 
kinetics26. Fluorescent probes have faster response times and 
have been deployed in cells2730 but rely on complicated 
fluorophore design and synthesis.
