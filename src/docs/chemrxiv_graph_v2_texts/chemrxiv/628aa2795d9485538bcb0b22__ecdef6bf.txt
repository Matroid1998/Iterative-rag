Description:
A material used in fluid catalytic cracking catalysts with mesoporosity mixed with a macroporous matrix.

8 For example,
fluid catalytic cracking catalysts used in industry commonly
employ a hierarchical structure such as a USY zeolite that has
mesoporosity mixed with a macroporous matrix. 9 The advan
tages of combining several porosity regimes in a single material
have been demonstrated in several applications relevant to the
fields of catalysis and phase separation, however, aspects of
guest behaviour in these porous systems remains uncertain. 10
Discovering the mechanisms ruling adsorption in hierarchical
solids is crucial for the future design of porous materials with
optimal properties toward applications. 11
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are widely recognised as
an important class of porous materials, featuring high porosity
from welldefined and tailored structures at the atomic level.
