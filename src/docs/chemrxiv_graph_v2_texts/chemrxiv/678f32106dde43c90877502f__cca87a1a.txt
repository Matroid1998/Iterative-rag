Description:
A metal with limited natural abundance, used in rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

The growing demand for portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, and increasing concerns 
about climate change have driven the development of sustainable energy storage technologies.1,2 
Renewable energy sources are being utilized to alter fossil fuels, addressing these concerns by 
generating energy without producing greenhouse gas emissions.3 Rechargeable Liion batteries 
dominate the global power market due to their superior energy density and extensive technological 
and industrial development.46 However, adopting LIBs as a longterm energy storage solution will 
be hindered by issues with the limited natural abundance of lithium (only 0.002), cost, and 
safety.7 Hence, to achieve the sustainable energy shift away from LIBs, different metal ion 
candidates such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Zn2, Al3 etc.
