Description:
Molecules involved in biosynthesis that can be inhibited by antibacterial agents.

Text:
To solve this problem, various approaches have been 
developed to elucidate the mechanism of action, both newly developed 3,68 and 
conventional, or classical ones. The gold standard for establishing the mechanism of 
action of an antibiotic is a macromolecular synthesis assay utilizing radioactively labeled 
precursors 9,10 (Fig. 1). However, this method, in addition to a number of practical 
problems associated with manipulating radioactive substances, has the disadvantage of not 
allowing reliable determination of all types of inhibition. This limitation arises because the 
action of an antibacterial agent is not always directly related to the inhibition of the 
biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, fatty acids or peptidoglycan.
