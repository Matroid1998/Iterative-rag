Description:
Substituted by heteroatom sites to generate charge imbalance for electrostatic stabilization.

Text:
Incorporation of noble and coinage metal atoms and clusters, such as Ir, Pd, Pt and Cu into zeolites 
has become a common strategy for generation of stable, monodisperse active sites for 
heterogeneous catalysis. (15) Electrostatic stabilisation may be achieved via pinning of partially 
oxidised atoms and clusters to the framework via the charge imbalance generated by substitution of 
silicon atoms with heteroatom sites (e.g. Al, B, Ga). (68) Alternatively, physically trapping metallic 
clusters within the cages of zeolites has been proposed to stabilize particles against sintering. (9) 
Nevertheless, for reduced atoms and clusters, sintering is energetically preferred, and the stability of 
encapsulated particles against sintering is often low, with rapid loss of internal metal loading over 
repeated catalytic cycles or at elevated temperatures.
