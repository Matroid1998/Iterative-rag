Description:
An electrophilic fluorine source provided by Selectfluor.

Selectfluor (1(chloromethyl)4fluoro1,4
diazoniabicyclo2.2.2octane bis(tetrafluoroborate)) 
was developed by Banks and Sharif at the University 
of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology as 
a crystalline, airstable source of F, has been 
commercialized by Air Products, and is now 
inexpensive and widely available.1, 2 Soon after its 
discovery, chemists came to appreciate that not only 
was Selectfluor a manageable source of electrophilic 
fluorine3, 4 but also that it was a remarkable oxidant, 
at once strong enough to trigger a variety of 
interesting reactions but mild enough to be 
compatible with a range of functional groups.58 One 
particularly interesting application of Selectfluor as an oxidant has been in its use for siteselective sp3 C
H functionalization reactions,930 an area of longstanding interest to us.3135 We were particularly attracted 
to the early work of Banks36 and later improvement by Baran37 on a Rittertype CH functionalization of 
menthol using a CuBr2Selectfluor manifold (Scheme 1A).
