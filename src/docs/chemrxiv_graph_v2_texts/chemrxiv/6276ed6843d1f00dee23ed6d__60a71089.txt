Description:
Identified as the most effective ligand in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling of styrenyl epoxides and boronic acids.

Text:
Over the past decade, Buchwaldtype phosphines have also 
found successful application in a limited number of Ni
catalyzed crosscoupling reactions (Figure 1C).1725 One of the 
first reports came from our lab in 2011 with the development of 
a Nicatalyzed crosscoupling of styrenyl epoxides and boronic 
acids, where BrettPhos was identified to be the most effective 
ligand in the transformation.18 The Watson and Crudden labs 
have also reported the use of Buchwaldtype phosphines in Ni
catalyzedcross 
coupling 
reactions 
of 
naphthylic 
pseudohalides.19,20 More recently, researchers at Bristol Myers 
Squibb identified CyJohnPhos as the most effective ligand for 
the Nicatalyzed borylation of aryl halides, with other examples 
of the ligand class amongst the top performers.21 Additionally, 
in a recent collaborative project carried out by our lab, the 
Sigman lab, and Merck  Co., Inc., we identified certain 
Buchwaldtype phosphines as top performing among 90 diverse 
monophosphines for several SuzukiMiyaura Coupling 
reactions (SMC) of aryl chlorides.25 
While these examples illustrate that Buchwald ligands are 
capable of imparting desirable reactivity in Nicatalyzed 
methodologies, little is known about their SRRs in Ni catalysis, 
or how their unique structure and binding modes interface with 
Ni more generally.

Description:
Forms an off-cycle, cyclometalated adduct during the cross-coupling of styrenyl epoxides.

A handful of computational studies have 
included Buchwald phosphines in their analyses, but the focus 
was not on the ligand class specifically.26,27 Nicasio and 
coworkers have structurally characterized dialkylterphenyl 
phosphines on Ni; these ligands share certain attributes with 
Buchwaldtype ligands.2830 However, to the best of our 
knowledge, only one example exists in the literature of a 
structurallycharacterized Ni complex bound by a Buchwald 
phosphine an offcycle, cyclometalated adduct of BrettPhos 
formed during the crosscoupling of styrenyl epoxides.18 Given 
the scarcity of relevant studies, insights into the SRRs and 
mechanism of Buchwald and CataCXium P phosphines in Ni 
catalysis, along with access to welldefined Ni complexes 
bearing these ligands, would be of great value both in the 
discovery of new methodologies and in the further 
understandingoptimization of existing ones.
