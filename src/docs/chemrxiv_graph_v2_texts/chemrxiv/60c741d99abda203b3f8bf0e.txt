Description:
Widely studied in semiconductor applications due to the tunability of their electronic properties via substitution and sequence control, as well as their environmental stability.

In recent years, conjugated polymers (CPs) have been of 
substantial research interest as new materials for use in a 
variety of optoelectronic devices, such as organic lightemitting 
diodes (OLEDs), organic fieldeffect transistors (OFETs), and 
organic photovoltaics (OPVs)1,2. CPs have several advantages 
over conventional inorganic materials including their relatively 
low cost and rolltoroll processability3. Polythiophenes have 
been widely studied in semiconductor applications due to the 
tunability of their electronic properties via substitution4,5 and 
sequence control6,7, as well as their environmental stability8,9. It has been shown that OLED, OFET, and OPV device 
performances are related to the frontier molecular orbital 
(FMO) energies of the conjugated polymers from which they are 
composed1,2,10.
