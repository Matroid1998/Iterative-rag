Description:
Forms part of the looplike structure in cycloparaphenylenes, with paraconnected rings.

Text:
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest building blocks of armchair carbon nanotubes and have 
attracted increasing attention due to their naturally curved nanohoop structure, which make them well suited 
as templates for hostguest chemistry and the bottomup synthesis of carbon nanotubes.13 Moreover, their 
curved and radially oriented system has generated increasing interest from the organic semiconductor 
community.46 A CPP consists of a number of paraconnected benzene rings to form a looplike structure. The aesthetically beautiful structure belies the significant embedded strain that results from the distorted 
benzene rings in the nanohoop, particularly the smaller analogs, which renders their synthesis challenging.
