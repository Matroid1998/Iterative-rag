Description:
A moiety that can be part of a carbaporphyrin fragment impacting the behavior towards the confining framework.

The 
structural 
rigidity 
and 
electronic 
properties 
of 
carbaporphyrins can impose unique steric and electronic effects 
on the coordination sphere of the encapsulated metal centre, 
potentially altering the typical reactivity patterns (or lack of 
such) observed for both the metal and the bound substrate, 
including ketoenol equilibrium in the case of the activated 
ketones. In this context, our research seeks to address this gap by 
systematically investigating the reactivity of a series of ketones 
confined within cobalt carbaporphyrin complexes. Through 
these studies, we aim to elucidate the mechanistic aspects of 
this confinement and its impact on the cobaltassisted 
activation and subsequent arylation of ketones with a 
carbaporphyrin fragment (azulene or pyrrole moiety), as well as 
the attached fragment behaviour towards the confining 
framework.
