Description:
Participates in substantial negative hyperconjugation with nitrogen in phosphine imides.

Text:
of unexplored substituents on the phosphine imidoyl nitrogen andor phosphorus 
atoms should facilitate the discovery of unprecedented utility for phosphine imides. Herein, we 
have designed and prepared a novel class of phosphine imides known as Nboranesubstituted 
cyclic phosphine imides (BCPIs). Experimental and theoretical analyses of the electronic 
structure of BCPIs demonstrate the existence of substantial negative hyperconjugation between 
the nitrogen and the phosphorus atoms. Given a characteristic nucleophilicLewis basic reactivity 
of BCPIs, we represent the first experimental demonstration that a 5oxazaphosphetane species 
is a key intermediate in the transformation of CO2 using phosphine imides.
