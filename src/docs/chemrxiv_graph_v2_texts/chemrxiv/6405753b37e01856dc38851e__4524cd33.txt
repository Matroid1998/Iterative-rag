Description:
A substrate for the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.

Text:
Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase(DHODH) is an enzyme that contains iron and flavin 
and is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. 1 Until now, DHODH becomes 
an attractive target for antimalignance due primarily to its importance in tumorigenesis 
and metastasis. There are many canonical DHODH inhibitors have being reported, such 
as leflunomide,2 BRQ,3 teriflunomide,4 ALASN003,5 and BAY2202234.6 
However, the use of HsDHODH inhibitors may cause some side effects, such as 
interfering with DNA synthesis and causing apoptosis, which can be harmful to the 
body. In addition, drug resistance may occur during their use.
