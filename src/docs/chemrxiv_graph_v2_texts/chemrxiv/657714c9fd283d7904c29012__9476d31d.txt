Description:
A close isostere of the oxoamide with both hydrogen bond acceptor and donor properties.

Text:
On the other hand, methyl
coenzyme M reductase (MCR)7 and E. coli 70S ribosome8 are 
the only proteins that have been shown to contain backbone 
thioamide bonds thus far. The thioamide is a close isostere of the oxoamide, having both 
hydrogen bond acceptor and donor properties; albeit, with 
different strengths (Table 1). Because of the weaker bond of the 
carbonyl in thioamides (CS bond length is 1.65  compared to 
CO with a bond length of 1.23 ), primarily due to the larger 
van der Waals radius of sulfur, there is an increased 
delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the carbonyl 
antibonding orbital.
