Description:
Shows strain-induced topological transitions from semimetals to topological insulators.

In recent years, transition metal chalcogenides have
gained growing interest due to their topological charac
teristics and intriguing physical properties, such as topo
logically insulating behavior and band inversion. For
example, the HgTeCdTe system was proposed to host
a strainengineered quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect,
which has since been experimentally realized.9,10 Simi
larly, topological band inversion and gap opening were
observed in a narrow gap semiconductor, WTe2.1114
Other materials, such as MoTe2, showed straininduced
topological transitions from semimetals to to topologi
cal insulators.15 The versatility of these materials makes
them promising for spintronic and electronic applica
tions.
