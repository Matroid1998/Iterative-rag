Anthracenetetrones are interesting compounds for technological applications and further 
conversion. For example, 1,4,9,10anthracenetetrone (Scheme 1, top), which is currently the 
best investigated anthracenetetrone, was used to modify electrodes for supercapacitors,1 
was applied as acceptor in chargetransfer complexes,24 it served as a precursor in the 
synthesis of antitumor compounds,5 and afforded pushpull chromophores in cycloaddition 
reactions with electronrich alkynes.6 Investigations of this anthracenetetrone are facilitated 
by its facile synthesis in a single highyielding reaction that uses lowcost 1,4dihydroxy9,10
anthraquinone 
as 
the 
starting 
material 
(Scheme 
1, 
top).7 
Different 
to 
other 
anthracenetetrones, also the crystal structure of this compound has been reported.8

Description:
Compounds that are challenging to synthesize and used in the synthesis of conjugated small molecules and polymers.

Text:
In contrast, the synthesis of 1,2,5,6 and 1,4,5,8anthracenetetrone (Scheme 1, bottom) is 
more challenging.912 This may explain why these compounds are less investigated despite 
the large number of available reactions for converting quinones, including our new 
conversion into cyanoarenes (demonstrated for 5,7,12,14pentacenetetrone and a range of 
other para and orthoquinones).1316 Beside other syntheses, the two tetrones are particularly 
interesting for the synthesis of conjugated small molecules and polymers, but they have 
been used in only a few reactions so far
