Description:
The dominant source of black carbon, which is the second largest cause of global warming.

However, other cases may 
be less restrictive; for example, the hemiterpene 
prenol (3methyl2buten1ol) is being investigated 
as a gasoline blendstock due to its high octane
sensitivity and synergistic blending behavior for 
octane number 8. An increasingly important property of fuels is 
sooting tendency. Soot emissions from combustion 
devices contribute to ambient fine particulates, 
which cause millions of deaths worldwide each year 
9, 10, and they are the dominant source of black 
carbon, which is the second largest cause of global 
warming 11.
