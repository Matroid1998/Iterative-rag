Description:
Molecular architectures used to achieve radical stabilization.

Text:
Synthetic molecular machines have opened up avenues for 
dynamically controlling the functions of molecular materials.1 
These controls are achieved by carefully programming the 
molecular system with suitable switchable moieties connected to 
functional units that can activate and deactivate specific functions 
on demand. Remarkable control of various molecular functions, 
such as lightpowered molecular motors, has become possible. 2 

The quest to stabilize free radicals has been a focal point of 
scientific exploration for decades, driven by their crucial roles in 
various domains, including molecular magnetism 3, organic 
spintronics 4, organic semiconductors 5 and memory devices.6 
Diverse molecular architectures have been developed to achieve 
radical stabilization by incorporating multiple electron sinks,79 or 
poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 1012 among others.
