Description:
Molecules that exhibit low-energy absorption bands and good thermal bistability, used in applications like molecular machines and photopharmacology.

Notable examples of photoswitchdriven 
nanodevices and molecular machines include the lightcontrol of surface wettability,4,5 
optoelectronics such as lightpowered electrical switches,6 chemical sensing,7,8 and 
photosensitive medicine.911 Especially for biological and material science 
applications that do not tolerate highenergy input, the absorption of visible light by the 
photoswitchable chromophores is particularly desirable.9,1217 
Apart from the longknown azobenzenes, a recently emerging class of photoswitches 
is given by indigoids18,19 and particularly hemithioindigo (HTI) (Scheme 1).20 These 
compounds feature such desired lowenergy absorption bands for electronic 
excitations together with a good thermal bistability, and chemical durability along the 
switching process.20,21 Consequentially, HTIs have found their way into a plethora of 
applications including molecular machines such as motors,3,22,23 gears,24,25 or 
tweezers,26 as well as photoresponsive catalysis,27 supramolecular chemistry,2830 
molecular computing,31,32 or photopharmacology.3336 Further chemical modifications 
have been employed to enable HTI attachment to metal surfaces,37 or to tailor self
assembly.38,39 
The photoreactions of hemithioindigobased molecules were extensively studied in the 
past by both, experimental4047 and theoretical investigations4851.
