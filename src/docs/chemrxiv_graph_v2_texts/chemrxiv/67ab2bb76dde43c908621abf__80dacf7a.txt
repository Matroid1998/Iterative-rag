Description:
Zeolites where the tetrahedral framework sites are occupied by Si and Al atoms.

Among many other 
classes of porous materials, zeolites, crystalline inorganic materials with a tetrahedral 
framework structure, have received considerable attention as materials for drug delivery 
applications.2,4,5 In aluminosilicate zeolites, the tetrahedral framework sites are occupied by Si 
and Al atoms, with a general framework composition Si1xAlxO2 (x  0.5).6 The SiAl ratio 
determines the framework charge and, consequently, the amount of positively charged species 
that are required for charge neutrality. Out of the variety of known zeolite frameworks types, 
zeolites having the FAU (faujasite) topology are particularly widely used in industrial 
processes, especially in catalysis and separation.7 Due to their good availability, large pore 
size, and the possibility to incorporate various species as extraframework cations, they have 
also been the focus of many drug delivery investigations.
