By integrating 
the 3D images of a material with information on its local chem
ical state, it is now possible to elucidate the reaction mecha
nisms of practical materials; for example, the degradation of Pt
alloy electrocatalysts in a working polymer electrolyte fuel 
cell,3641 oxygen storage in a threeway automobile catalyst,42,43 
and heterogeneous rubberbrass composites.44 
This stateoftheart XAFSCT technique has also been ap
plied to MOF materials to reveal the incorporation of defective 
structures in MOF crystals.45,46 However, these studies have
