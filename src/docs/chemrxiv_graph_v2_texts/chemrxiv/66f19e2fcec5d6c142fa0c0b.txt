Description:
Insoluble in most organic and aqueous solvents, typically combined with PSS to enhance processability.

These properties enable many applications in organic 
electronics, such as sensors, supercapacitors, and solar cells.512 Poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) has 
emerged as a promising candidate due to its superior electronic and ionic conductivities, desirable optical 
properties, and resistance to humidity and oxidants.13 However, PEDOT is insoluble in most organic and aqueous 
solvents, so it is typically combined with PSS, allowing PEDOT to be dispersed in aqueous solutions to enhance 
its processability.14 Additionally, PSS serves as a dopant, and the presence of PSS has been shown to result in a 
more crystalline PEDOT structure.15,16 
Unfortunately, PSS also has its drawbacks.
