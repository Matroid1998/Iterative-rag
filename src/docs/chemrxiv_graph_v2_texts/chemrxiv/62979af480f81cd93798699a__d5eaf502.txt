aminated lignin prior to the particle formation and demonstrated the corresponding LNPs for 
the conjugation of histidine for pHresponsive drug release in cancer treatment.10 Our group 
discovered that nanoparticles prepared from lignin oleate show longterm stability under acidic 
(pH 2) and alkaline (pH 12) conditions without any crosslinking.11 Although these two 
examples highlight functional LNPs, these approaches suffer from one of the two limitations 
(i) loss of particles if exposed to basic pH or organic solvents and (ii) consumption of free 
aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups. This limits the processibility and recycling of LNPs in 
common chemical processes which involve aqueous alkali and organic solvents.
