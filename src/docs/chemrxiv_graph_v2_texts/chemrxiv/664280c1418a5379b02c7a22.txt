Description:
Atoms that increase the binding energy when incorporated into the lattice of MoO2.

Text:
of carbon atoms into the lattice of MoO2 increases the binding energy from 1.4 eV 
to 1.7 eV, which contributes to the improved stability of the catalyst under such harsh 
operational conditions. Figure 4. (a) Chronoamperometry measurements of HCPMoOC, commercial PtC and MoO2 catalysts. (b)

performance of the HCPMoOC and the stateoftheart catalysts. Calculated binding energy of (d) MoO2 
and (e) MoOC. Conclusion 
In summary, we report the design of a new catalyst based on molybdenum oxycarbide (i.e., 
MoOxCy) nanosheets with petallike structures and controlled chemical compositions by 
PECVD using salts as solid precursors.
