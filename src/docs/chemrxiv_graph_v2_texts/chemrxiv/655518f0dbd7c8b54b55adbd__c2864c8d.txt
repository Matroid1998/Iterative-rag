Yielded from aldehydes within Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi type reactivity.

Consequently, the quest for alternative strategies that circumvent these limitations while 
facilitating the construction of threedimensional molecular structures persists as an imperative in 
medicinal chemistry research.7 
In recent years, nickelmediated crosselectrophile (XEC) coupling has emerged as a potent strategy for 
constructing C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds, utilizing various native and benchstable aliphatic coupling entities, 
thus circumventing the use of moisturesensitive organometallic species.815 Despite substantial strides 
within this sphere, exploiting varied, ubiquitous functional groups such as aldehydes as coupling 
partners has lingered in a state of underdevelopment. Traditionally, aldehydes have been harnessed as 
carbonyl electrophiles with Mg or Libased organometallic species or within NozakiHiyamaKishi 
(NHK) type reactivity to yield alcohols,16,17 yet their employment to forge C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds via a 
reductive deoxygenative pathway remains, to our knowledge, uncharted.
