Biomass burning events emit a large amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can 
be oxidized in the atmosphere, leading to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by gasto
particle partitioning of the oxidized products.14 Phenolic compounds such as catechol, guaiacol, 
and syringol (Fig. S1) are major types of VOCs from biomass burning events that lead to the 
formation of biomass burning SOA (BBSOA) in the atmosphere.1,2,512

BBSOA and other particulate matter emitted from biomass burning play an important role 
in climate and air quality.
