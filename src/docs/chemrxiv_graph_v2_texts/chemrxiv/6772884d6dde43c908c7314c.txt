Fig. 1. Bridged bicyclic hydrocarbons as bioisosteres of benzene rings, and heterocyclic 
50 
analogues based on the bicyclo3.1.1heptane framework. a, Carbocyclic n.1.1propellanes 1, 
51 
prepared from metallation of dibromocyclopropanes 2, are versatile precursors for the synthesis of 
52 
bicyclon.1.1alkanes such as BCPs and BCHeps, which serve as bioisosteres for disubstituted 
53 
benzene rings in drug design. b, Existing routes to 3azabicyclo3.1.1heptanes typically rely on 
54 
threeatom insertions into BCBs, which necessarily introduce specific substitution patterns.
