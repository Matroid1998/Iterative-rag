Description:
Functionalized forms used to enhance CO2 capture performance.

This structural design pre
vents water or CO2 from interfering with the bond between Zr(IV) 
and the carboxylate of the amino acids. In this study, we used MOF808 as the basis for generating the 
amino acid functionalized forms. We measured and confirmed their 
enhanced CO2 capture performance in the presence of water 
through sorption studies. These involved singlecomponent
