Description:
A stable cation in aerobic and aqueous conditions, central to uranium chemistry research.

Text:
The uranyl cation has long been central to uranium chemistry research owing to its stability 
in aerobic and aqueous conditions, making it more environmentally relevant and easier to study 
than more reactive forms of uranium.18 Whereas much research has probed uranyl properties 
through changes in equatorial ligand coordination, there is also a need to probe the effects of 
secondsphere interactions. In particular, there is a growing interest in studying interactions with 
the uranyl oxo groups as they have been shown to promote uranium redox activity which can be 
leveraged for the purposes of separations or catalysis.914 Of the many possible oxointeracting 
species, metal cationoxo interactions are of particular interest as they have been demonstrated to 
have significant effects on uranyl electronic structure. 1,1519 Arnold et al.

have extensively studied 
the effects of Mnoxo interactions for the purposes of promoting uranyl redox activity by using 
Pac Man ligand derivatives to engineer close Mnoxo interactions. By engineering these close 
contacts they were able to promote significant bond asymmetry indicative of bond 
weakening.1,17,2023 Harder, less polarizable cations, such as Group 1 cations or lanthanides have
