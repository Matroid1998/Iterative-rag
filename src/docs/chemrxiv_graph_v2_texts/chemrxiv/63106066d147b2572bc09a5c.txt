Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides impeccable insight
into local solvation structure in the vicinity of the chromophore.1
SoftXAS has been used as a direct probe of microheterogeneity in
aqueous acetonitrile solutions2 and has revealed the contrasting
nature between weak ammoniawater and strong ammonium
water hydrogen bonds.3,4 Xray absorption nestructure (XAFS)
spectroscopy was also recently applied to study the hydration
structure about ions of all of the rst row transition metal ele
ments.5 As the application of XASrelated methods becomes more
ubiquitous, it is increasingly important that theoretical methods
meet the challenge of modeling XAS in liquid phase to aid in spec
tral assignments and to shed light on the atomistic structural de
tails that lead to key spectroscopic signatures.

Description:
Aqueous ammonia is involved in XAS spectral profiles.

Text:
Despite the complexity of the condensed phase, the methods
with the most success in reproducing both the energies and in
tensities of liquidphase XAS are wave function approaches such
as restricted activespace (RAS)5 and coupledcluster with single
and double excitations (CCSD).22 These approaches have been
contrasted with transitionpotential density functional theory (TP
DFT)2325 and TDDFT, and in both cases the success of wave
function theory where DFT failed was attributed to the lack of
double excitations in the DFTbased approaches.26 This hypothe
sis appears to be bolstered by the fact that perturbative inclusion
of double excitations via CC2 also fails to accurately model the
XAS spectral proles of aqueous ammonia and ammonium.
