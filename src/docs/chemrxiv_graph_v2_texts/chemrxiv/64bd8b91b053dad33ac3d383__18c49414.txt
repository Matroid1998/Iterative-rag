Description:
A conductive material used in modern lead-acid batteries.

Text:
The 
volcano plot shows that lead is a bad HER promoter, which enables and limits the relatively 
high negative plate potential. However, the modern leadacid batterys evolution depends on 
the insertion of other materials beyond lead 2. These other materials are conductive ones (as 
carbonblack and acetyleneblack) 3, expanders (as lignosulfonates) 4, electric double layer 
capacitance (EDLC) materials 5,6 (like carbons in many forms as activated carbon 7, carbon 
nanotubes 8, and graphene 9). These materials powder mostly blend in the LAB negative 
active mass (NAM) but are not limited to it. For example, extensive EDLC anodes and lower 
specific mass current collectors may be of interest. Including these materials always has a limit 
because they may enhance HER at lower potentials than lead.
