Description:
Used as a comilling reagent to destroy perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid.

Text:
Using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a comilling reagent destroys perfluorooctanoic 
55 
acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS).19,20 However, the residual KOH in the 
56 
media must be neutralized before discharge. Using quartz sand (SiO2) as a neutral reagent to 
57 
destroy PFAS is possible. However, the degradation kinetics are slower, and the fluoride yield is 
58 
low.20,21 Previously, we discovered that boron nitride (BN), a piezoelectric material, can be 
59 
activated in the BM process to generate kV potential to destroy solid PFAS.22 Building upon this
