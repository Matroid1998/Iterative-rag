Description:
A functional group that has been used as a leaving group in metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Nitroaromatics have served as important sources for the production of nitrogencontaining chemicals during the 
past century.5 Recently, the nitrogroup on these compounds had been resurrected as a leaving group by the metal
catalyzed crosscoupling reactions, enriching the chemistry of nitroaromatics.6 However, on another main branch 
of the modern synthesis, these substrates showed an unfavored features for prevailing CH activation in that 1) 
the low electrodensity retards the CH activation, and 2) the weak coordinating ability makes the preactivation 
intermediate unstable.
