Further
exploration in these areas holds significant potential to unlock
their full capabilities. Notably, Gao and colleagues firstprinciples
findings suggest that NC60 fullerene could serve as a promising
cathode catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells by facilitating the wa
ter formation reaction without encountering activation energy
barriers11. Despite valuable insights from previous research,
a comprehensive understanding of their electronic, optical, and
mechanical characteristics is still awaited. Peng and his team recently discovered that using a weakly
screened hybrid functional in conjunction with timedependent
HartreeFock calculations can accurately reproduce the exper
imentally measured optical band gap of the monolayer of
C60
12,13. The various phases of monolayer fullerene networks
feature suitable band gaps, displaying high carrier mobility and
appropriate band edges.
