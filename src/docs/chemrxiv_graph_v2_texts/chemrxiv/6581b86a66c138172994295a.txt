Description:
An additive in all-solid-state batteries that can lose contact with active materials, leading to capacity fading.

Allsolidstate batteries (ASSBs) are currently discussed to increase the energy andor power 
34 
density, and are expected to be one of the next generation lithiumbased battery 
35 
technologies.1 However, the cell concept does not come without problems, as volume 
36 
changes occurring for the active electrode material can lead to significant capacity fading on 
37 
extended cycling. This mainly originates from a loss of contact of the active material to the 
38 
carbon additive and the solid electrolyte. Various research attempts were made to limit capacity 
39 
fading, among them, the advantageous effect of pressure on the performance of ASSBs has 
40 
been demonstrated several times 26, and could be assigned to decreased contact resistance 
41 
and reduction of volume changeinduced contact loss between particles during cycling.
