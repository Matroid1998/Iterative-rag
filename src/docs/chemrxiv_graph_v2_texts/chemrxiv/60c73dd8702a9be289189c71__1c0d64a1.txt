Description:
Used to modify electrodes for supercapacitors and as an acceptor in charge-transfer complexes.

Text:
Anthracenetetrones are interesting compounds for technological applications and further 
conversion. For example, 1,4,9,10anthracenetetrone (Scheme 1, top), which is currently the 
best investigated anthracenetetrone, was used to modify electrodes for supercapacitors,1 
was applied as acceptor in chargetransfer complexes,24 it served as a precursor in the 
synthesis of antitumor compounds,5 and afforded pushpull chromophores in cycloaddition 
reactions with electronrich alkynes.6 Investigations of this anthracenetetrone are facilitated 
by its facile synthesis in a single highyielding reaction that uses lowcost 1,4dihydroxy9,10
anthraquinone 
as 
the 
starting 
material 
(Scheme 
1, 
top).7 
Different 
to 
other 
anthracenetetrones, also the crystal structure of this compound has been reported.8 

Scheme 1 Facile synthesis of 1,4,9,10antracenetrone starting from 1,4dihydroxy9,10anthraquinone (top), 
molecular structure of 1,2,5,6 and 1,4,5,8anthracenetetrone (bottom).
