Description:
Reactive intermediates containing an electrophilic site used as 1,6-Michael acceptors.

paraQuinone methides (pQMs) are a variety of compounds that have been 
extensively studied in the organic synthesis field over the past few years.1 They can be 
characterized as reactive intermediates containing an electrophilic site.2 Therefore, there 
is recent development of nucleophilic additions to pQMs as 1,6Michael acceptors using 
different types of catalysts.3 Some Lewis acids can be used as catalysts in these reactions 
since they coordinate with the carbonyl group of the pQMs, rendering the olefin more 
electrophilic and thus more prone to 1,6nucleophilic conjugate addition.4 To the best of 
our knowledge, the reaction between paraquinone methides and indolizines have not 
been extensively studied. Indolizines are a class of heteroaromatic compounds isomeric to the indole motif.
