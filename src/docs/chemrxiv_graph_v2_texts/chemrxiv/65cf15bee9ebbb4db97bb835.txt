Description:
Used in the preparation of hydrophilic mesoporous materials.

For one thing, postmodification is a straight forward approach to functionalize 
pore walls. In this case, functional groups will be introduced onto the predesigned 
framework after the preparation of porous materials.1517 For another thing, inherent 
functional groups on the pore walls can be introduced during the pore formation process. In particular, by rational designing topological structure of block copolymers, 
mesoporous materials with grafted polymers on the pore walls can be prepared.18 For 
instance, for ABC triblock terpolymer with a degradable endblock, midblockgrafted 
mesopores is able to be prepared by removing endblock after selectively etching. For 
example, Hillmyer and coworkers reported the preparation of hydrophilic mesoporous 
materials using polylactidebpoly(N,Ndimethylacrylamide)bpolystyrene (PLA
