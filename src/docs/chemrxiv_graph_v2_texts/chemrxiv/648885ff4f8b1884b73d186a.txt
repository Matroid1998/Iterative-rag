Description:
Used in assays to monitor anion transport in liposomes.

Text:
to the practical use and understanding of the lucigenin assay. It describes in detail 
how to use this assay to monitor chloridenitrate antiport in liposomes, process and interpret the data, 
and solve common issues. Variations of the assay enabling the investigation of the transport of other 
anions and transport mechanisms are discussed. Furthermore, a zwitterionic analogue of lucigenin is 
demonstrated to have advantages for use in specific cases. Key words Anion transport, Fluorescent probes, Fluorescence spectroscopy, Liposomes,
