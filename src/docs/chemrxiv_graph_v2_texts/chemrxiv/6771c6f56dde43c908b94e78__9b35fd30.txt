and atomeconomic approach for nitrile synthesis (Figure 1a).10 Conventionally, this reaction 
relies on transition metal (TM) based catalysts,1115 as TMfree hydrocyanation is typically 
restricted to activated alkynes.1619 In recent years, developing new strategies for alkyne 
hydrocyanation has attracted considerable attention,11,13 including methods employing HCN 
surrogates as a substitute for the highly toxic and volatile HCN.2028 However, a critical 
challenge that still remains underdeveloped is the control of regioselectivity in the HCN 
addition.
