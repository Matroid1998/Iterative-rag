Description:
Employed as a phase transfer catalyst in the reaction of a prochiral anion with an alkyl halide.

Classical methods were inefficient, 
involving separation via crystallization of diastereomers or the 
use of chiral auxiliaries.2,1113 In the last few years, catalytic 
synthetic methods have developed to access enantioenriched 
SIAs (Figure 1B). One strategy for the synthesis of 
enantioenriched SIAs involves the generation of enantiopure 
sulfonimidoyl chlorides via chiral phosphoric acid catalysis 
followed by a stereospecific amination.14 Williss strategy 
employs an enantioselective desymmetrization of SIAs.15 
Symmetrically disubstituted SIAs tautomerize between their 
RS enantiomers and the ions generated from deprotonation or 
protonation are prochiral.15 A bisquaternized cinchona alkaloid 
was employed as a phase transfer catalyst that facilitated the 
reaction of a prochiral anion of the SIA with an alkyl halide 
electrophile yielding a variety of enantioenriched Nalkyl SIAs.
