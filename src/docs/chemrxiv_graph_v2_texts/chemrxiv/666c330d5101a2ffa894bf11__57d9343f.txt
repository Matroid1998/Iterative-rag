Description:
Has a geometric preference for certain bond angles in Si8nGenO20 cubic subunits.

Text:
An elegant study by OKeefe and Yaghi6 linked the possibility to
form zeolite structures containing Ge, Si or both, to the geometric
preference of various bond angles for Ge and Si in Si8nGenO20
cubic subunits. Villaescusa et al.7 subsequently synthesised the
