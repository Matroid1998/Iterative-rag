Description:
A global pollutant known for its toxicity and ability to travel through the atmosphere.

Text:
Mercury is wellknown as one of the most toxic metals for vertebrates.1,2 It can be released to the 
environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources,3,4 and also from reemissions of 
previously deposited mercury.5,6 Mercury is a global pollutant because of its ability to travel 
through the atmosphere far from emission sources.7,8 Despite that the atmosphere only contain 
0.3 of the total environmental mercury,9 it remains crucial for the mercury cycle because gas
phase mercury redox chemistry1018 greatly influences when and where mercury deposits to 
ecosystems (Figure 1).1923 Specifically, Hg(II) readily deposits to lakes and oceans, while Hg(0) is 
much more likely to be taken up in vegetation.6,9,23

Description:
A serious hazard that can be bioaccumulated, biomagnified, and transported in the form of organomercury, especially through the aquatic food chain.

Text:
Once mercury is deposited, it can be bioaccumulated, biomagnified and transported in the form of 
organomercury, especially through the aquatic food chain, and ultimately have negative effects on 
human and animal health.2430 Therefore, mercury is a serious hazard that has been a major concern 
amongst environmental and scientists for decades. Despite great strides in our understanding of 
the mechanisms of mercury chemistry in the atmosphere, the lack of knowledge of the kinetics
