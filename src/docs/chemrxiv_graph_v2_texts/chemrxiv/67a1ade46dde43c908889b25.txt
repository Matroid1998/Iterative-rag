Description:
An NMR active spin 1/2 nucleus used in protein dynamics analysis.

Text:
The dynamic exchange of conformational states is crucial to 
protein function.1,2 Modern NMR spectroscopy provides an 
extensive array of techniques to analyse protein dynamics, 
interactions and structure of proteins in solution.39 The majority 
of these experiments require the insertion of NMR active spin 12 
nuclei like carbon13 and nitrogen15 orand the replacement of 
protons with deuterons to reduce spectral complexity, increase 
resolution and optimize magnetization transfer pathways.1013 
While many experiments exclusively focus on the protein 
backbone, it becomes more and more evident that the full 
potential of protein NMR can only be released when selective 
isotope patterns, which are tailored to pulse sequences aiming for 
side chain detection, are considered.1419 Especially, the 
functional groups at the end of longer side chains display 
additional 
conformational 
dynamics, 
which 
are 
largely 
independent from backbone motion.
