Description:
Undergo hydrogen atom abstraction for radical esterification.

Text:
The nascent CO2 is welldocumented for its reactivity 
in undergoing radical addition into activated and unactivated alkenes 
exemplified by the elegant work of Wickens,11 Yu,12 and others 
(Figure 1B).13 Similarly, the closely related alkoxycarbonyl radical has 
been accessed through a variety of activation methods including 
singleelectron activation of radical precursors,14 triplet energy 
transfer to oximes,15 and hydrogen atom abstraction of alkyl 
formates16 for radical esterification. However, these strategies rely
