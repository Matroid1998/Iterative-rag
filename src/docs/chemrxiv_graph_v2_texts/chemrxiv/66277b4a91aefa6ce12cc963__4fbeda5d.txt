Description:
Can access the active site of oxygen-tolerant hydrogenase through expanded tunnels.

The
difference in size and dipole moment between the substrate and the inhibitor molecules of the
hydrogenases suggests that this strategy is feasible. Tunnel engineering can be used to change the
preferences of an enzyme for binding to and accommodating specific ligands by sitespecific
point mutations24,26,31,32. In hydrogenases, the active site is buried in the core of the enzyme and
ligands need to travel a long distance through the tunnels to reach it. In 2005, Buhrke et al.33
reported that an oxygentolerant hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha H16 can become sensitive
to O2 by introducing specific point mutations which expand the tunnels leading to the active site,
which ultimately facilitate the access of O2.
