Description:
Ions that bind to amyloids with high affinity, influencing peptide aggregation.

Text:
Senile plaques, also called amyloid plaques, are a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD), the most common 
neurodegenerative disorder. The plaques are mainly composed of small peptides from a family called amyloids (A) 12 
and concentrations of copper ions as high as 400 mM.3, which is around 200 time higher than the normal brain 
extracellular concentration (0.21.7 mM.4,5). It has been widely described that copper ions bind to As with high affinity 
influencing the aggregation processes of these peptides. The Cuions also catalyze the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS  e.g.
