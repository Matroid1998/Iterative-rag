Description:
Forms conjugates with maleimide in ADCs, which can undergo biotransformation.

Text:
The released payload 
components from ADC are subject to small molecule 
metabolism by enzymes in the liver such as CYP450s.3 Another 
scenario is when linkerpayload is still conjugated to the 
antibody, but has been modified. Typically, conjugated linker
payload remain quite stable in circulation because ADCs reside 
in the extracellular environment and have limited exposure to 
metabolizing enzymes. However, biotransformation can still 
occur on the linkerpayload. One reported example is 
maleimide ring hydrolysis commonly observed on cysteine 
conjugated ADCs.
