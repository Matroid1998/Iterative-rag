Description:
A key element involved in carbon neutrality applications.

Zeolitic materials, such as in zeolites13 and zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)46  organic
inorganic hybrid cousin, are all assembled from tetrahedral structural building units, and 
extremely useful in numerous areas,3 ranging from biomedical79 to petrochemical,1013 and 
further to carbon neutrality applications.1416 Despite their significant presence in both industry 
and academia for the past several decades, surprisingly, only 255 zeolites17 and about 50 ZIFs6 
are known to exist to date. On the contrary, the possible zeolitic materials are well over few 
millions accumulated in hypothetical zeolite databases.18,19 This striking mismatch between 
experiment and prediction outcomes has become zeolite conundrum,20 demanding significant 
strategic breakthroughs in material discovery.
