Preparation of the reference catalyst 
Benchmark TS1 (TS1) was prepared with a Ti 
loading of 1.8 (here and after the loading is expressed 
as mol Ti  (mol Ti  mol Si)  100 ) using titanium 
isopropoxide (TiiP) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) 
as 
Ti 
and 
Si 
sources, 
respectively, 
and 
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as structure 
directing agent 35. The detailed preparation procedure
