Description:
A key intermediate involved in hydrogen evolution with molecular catalysts.

Text:
However,
obtaining information on the elementary reac
tion steps involved in catalysis is challenging,
because common methods like electrochemistry
can drive catalysis but offer little structural in
sight into the reactivity happening under cat
alytic conditions.2
In light of the relevance of catalyst de
sign to myriad issues in sustainability sci
ence, significant experimental and computa
tional work has focused on identifying the
key intermediates involved in hydrogen evo
lution with molecular catalysts.313 One no
table catalyst for hydrogen generation, origi
nally reported by Gratzel and Kolle in 1987,
is built on the CpRh motif, where Cp 
5pentamethylcyclopentadienyl.4 Catalysts in
this family are supported by additional biden
tate diimine ligands, such as 2,2bipyridyl
