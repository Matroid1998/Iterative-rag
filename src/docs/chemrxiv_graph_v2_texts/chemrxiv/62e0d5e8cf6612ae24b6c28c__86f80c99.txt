Description:
A graphite intercalation compound with relatively covalent bonding and a different structure from other GICs.

Text:
However, no studies have reported the A or 
AA stacking for the MC8 composition to date, and only the AAA and AAAA 
stacking have been reported. Although several studies have suggested the synthesis of 
CFx (2  x  5) as GICs 1518, their treatment in the same category as other GICs is 
controversial because their bonding is relatively covalent and their structure is different 
from that of others 19,20. Fig. 1. (a) Intercalant sites in MC6 and MC8. (b) Structures and compositions of reported
