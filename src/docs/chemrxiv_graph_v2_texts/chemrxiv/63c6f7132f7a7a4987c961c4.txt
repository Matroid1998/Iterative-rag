Description:
Compounds that undergo photocycloaddition, where coordination with a chiral Lewis acid can alter absorption properties and lower LUMO energy.

Within 
these strategies, the role of the chiral Lewis acid for the enantioselectivity of the photocatalyzed 
reaction can be manifold as has been elegantly shown by pioneering work of the groups of Bach4, 
Yoon5 and Meggers.6 
One such mode of enantioinduction via a chiral Lewis acid was shown by the Bach group in the 22 
photocycloaddition of enones (Scheme 1A).4e In this example, coordination of chiral Lewis acid LA1 
to the substrate results in a change in the substrates absorption properties and leads to a red shift 
by lowering the energy of the LUMO, rendering an uncoordinated racemic background reaction less 
feasible as compared to excitation of the chiral Lewis acid substrate complex.
