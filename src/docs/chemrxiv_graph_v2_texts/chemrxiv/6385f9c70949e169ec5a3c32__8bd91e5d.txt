Description:
A toxic acid commonly utilized in chemical processes.

Text:
While low temperatures and polar 
solvents preferentially lead to the pisomer, high temperatures 
and nonpolar solvents or even solventfree approaches lead to 
the oisomer.4,5,7,9,10 The Fries rearrangement of phenyl acetate 
(PA), thus, leads to parahydroxyacetophenone (pHAP) and 
orthohydroxyacetophenone (oHAP). While oHAP is of minor 
importance in the production of fine chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals, pHAP is the economically most important 
hydroxyaryl ketone, produced in quantities of 1.000 to 10.000 
tons per year in the European Union alone.11 Accordingly, it is 
desirable to influence the isomer ratio and shift it in favour of 
pHAP while at the same time getting rid of the large amounts 
of toxic solvents and acids commonly utilized (e.g., hydrofluoric 
acid).
