Description:
An earth-abundant element used in solid electrolytes.

While lithiumion batteries with liquid electrolytes entered the market in 1991, allsolid
state lithiumion batteries (ASSLIBs), although investigated for decades, are still not widely
in use.16 ASSLIBs promise several advantages in comparison to liquid electrolyte batter
ies higher power density, minimized safety and re hazards, longer cycle lifetimes, more
comprehensive temperature ranges, and enhanced energy density by potential usage of Li
metal anodes.1,7,8 Solid electrolytes of the Li2SP2S5 material class have gained substantial
attention due to their favorable properties.6 First, they possess high conductivities of up
to 102 Scm1, which ranks them among the most conductive solid electrolytes such as
Li10GeP2S12 or Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3.9,10 Secondly, they are composed of the earthabundant
elements sulfur and phosphorous enabling sustainable applications at large scales.
