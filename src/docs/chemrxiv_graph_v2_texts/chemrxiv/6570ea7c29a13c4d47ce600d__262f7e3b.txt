Description:
Two-dimensional materials that can bind biological macromolecules such as proteins and DNA.

Complex surface structures are responsible for the 
remarkable degree of biomolecular selectivity found in nature. Macromolecules bind to these biointerfaces through multiple 
weak interactions, with electrostatic and hydrophobic 
interactions 
critical 
in 
determining 
selectivity.1 Two
dimensional materials represent promising artificial mimics due 
to their high specific surface areas and accessible functional 
groups.2,3 A wide range of nanomaterials including transition 
metal dichalcogenides, MXenes and graphene have displayed 
an ability to bind biological macromolecules such as proteins 
and DNA.46 However, the simple inorganic structure of these 
surfaces leads to stochastic functionalization with different 
binding groups, therefore limiting their selectivity.
