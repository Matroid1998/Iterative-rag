Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), renowned for its green and environmentally friendly 
52 
properties, has catalyzed extensive research efforts aimed at developing synthetic 
53 
methods, largely fueled by its diverse industrial applications, including textile 
54 
bleaching1, chemical synthesis2, papermaking3, pharmaceuticals4, and water 
55 
purification5. Currently, industrial H2O2 production primarily depends on the costly and 
56 
polluting RiedlPfleiderer process, involving alkyl anthraquinone oxidation and 
57 
hydrogenation.69 Fortunately, the direct electrosynthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 
58 
through the twoelectron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) presents a promising 
59 
alternative. This strategy offers lower energy consumption, environmental friendliness, 
60 
and reduced transportation and storage risks, making it suitable for smallscale and even 
61 
in situ production.1012 Despite larger development (e.g.
