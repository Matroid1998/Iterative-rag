Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to global emissions, projected to reach 2.5 Gt per year by 2030 in the trucking sector.

Decarbonization of trucks is necessary to achieve 2050 climate goals.1 The International
Energy Agency (IEA) classifies trucking as a tough to decarbonize sector and projects global
emissions to reach 2.5 Gt of CO2 per year by 2030, a 25 increase from 2020.1 Within this
sector, longhaul trucks contribute to 39 of the sectors greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
despite accounting for only 9 of global cargo vehicles.2 The importance of longhaul trucks
is even greater in the United States where they carry 71 of all payload, and their demand
is expected to double between 2020 and 2050.3,4 Mitigating emissions and meeting climate
targets requires replacing existing diesel trucks with renewable options. Electrification is accepted as a promising strategy for lightduty vehicles (LDV).
