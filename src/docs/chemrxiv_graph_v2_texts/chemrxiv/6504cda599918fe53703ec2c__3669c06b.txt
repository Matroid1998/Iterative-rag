Description:
Exhibit superior selectivity for monobromination.

Preliminary explorations also point to the enhanced reactivity of ano
meric amide reagents in settings other than electrophilic aromatic sub
stitution (Figure 2A). For instance, in the abromination of (hetero)ar
omatic methyl ketones (4749), superior selectivity for monobromina
tion is observed across the board. Similarly, the acidic methylene group 
of cyclic Nsulfonylimine 50 could be efficiently brominated with a su
perior yield (83) compared with known procedure (24) using Py
HBr345. An improved yield was also observed in allylic bromination of 
(R)carvone (51) relative to standard conditions4647. Finally, enol ace
tate 52 (prasugrel) could be chlorinated in nearly quantitative yield. The most glaring concern a practitioner would have in considering the 
use of anomeric amides such as 6 and 7 is safety on scale.
