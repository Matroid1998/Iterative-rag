Description:
Studied for its optical, structural, and moisture-resistance properties due to the variety of organic spacers.

Text:
A2PbX4, have been thoroughly studied thanks to the extremely rich variety of 
organic spacers which can be incorporated into the layered structure giving origin to an 
impressive modulation of their optical, structural and moistureresistance properties.2,3 2D RP 
perovskites containing linear monoammonium cations of general formula (CnH2n1NH3)2PbX4, 
have been among the first to be explored, even before the advent of MHPs photovoltaics.49 
These early studies mostly focused on the elucidation of the crystal structure as a function of 
the number of carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain as well as on the understanding of the phase 
transitions commonly found in these compounds.
