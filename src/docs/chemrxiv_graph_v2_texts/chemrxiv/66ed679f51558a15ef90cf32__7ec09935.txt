Description:
An isomer identified in prokaryotic cells, specifically in E. coli, with R,S configuration.

Text:
Based on the literature, only the R,S isomer of PG has been found in eukaryotic organisms, 
e.g., soybean or cabbage leaf 8, or algae (green algae Enteromorpha sp. and Chlorella 
vulgaris, raphidophyte alga Heterosigma akashiwo) 9. One of the few exceptions, when the 
structure of glycerol 1phosphate is also present in mammalian lipids, is the minorly represented 
phospholipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, also known as lysobisphosphatidic acid 10. On 
the other hand, two isomers have been identified in prokaryotic cells, specifically in E. coli, i.e., 
the isomer 1,2diacylsnglycero3phospho1snglycerol (R,S configuration) and 1,2diacyl
snglycero3phospho3snglycerol (R,R configuration) 8. The R,R isomer was also 
identified in 16 marine bacteria in amounts up to 6.5 of total PG 11. The composition of PG
