Description:
Involved in the transition metal catalyzed reaction of reductive hydroformylation with alkenes.

of reactive functionality into 
feedstock molecules is a wellestablished strategy for 
accessing 
highervalue 
products 
from 
abundant 
hydrocarbons. To this end, alcohols are ideal targets for 
synthetic elaboration,1 supported by an expansive 
methodological framework that encompasses oxidative, 
redoxneutral, and reductive transformations.2 Catalytic 
methods that generate alcohols directly from alkenes are 
therefore impactful in chemical synthesis, especially 
where high chemo and regioselectivity is achieved.3 
Reductive hydroformylation, a transition metal 
catalyzed reaction involving the addition of carbon 
monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2) to alkenes, is an 
atom economical method for the direct synthesis of C1
homologated alcohols. The tandem process involves the 
initial generation of aldehydes and subsequent reduction 
(Scheme 1A).
