Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for reduction through carbon capture technologies.

Text:
There is no doubt that CCUS has the 
41 
potential to reduce CO2 emissions in the short term, but the high cost and energy 
42 
requirements of current CO2 capture methods make it a challenging technological 
43 
option. Generally, the carbon capture technology can be divided into the pre
44 
combustion capture, oxyfuel combustion capture, and postcombustion capture3. In 
45 
general, the postcombustion capture is considered the most feasible method of 
46 
capturing CO2 as it has a mature technology and is easy to integrate with other industrial
