Description:
Undergoes nuclear fission to produce radioactive isotopes of Xe and Kr.

Text:
Radioactive isotopes of Xe and Kr are
produced by the nuclear ssion of both uranium and of plutoniumwhether controlled, to generate
power, or uncontrolled, to generate an explosion 3,4. The tasks of separating XeKr and ArO2N2 mixtures are encountered during the industrial produc
tion of pure Xe, Kr, and Ar by isolating them from air. Cryogenic distillation plants that (primarily)
produce pure O2 and N2 from air also produce impure or mixed byproduct streams highly enriched
with noble gases  a XeKr stream and an Ar stream contaminated with O2 and N2. These streams
are then subject to further cryogenic separations to obtain pure Xe, Kr, and Ar for their many uses.
