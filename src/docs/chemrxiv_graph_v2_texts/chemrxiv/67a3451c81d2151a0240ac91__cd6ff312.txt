Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process in fuel cell chemistry.

Text:
Considering the global need to move from fossil fuels to re
newable sources of energy, fuel cell chemistry and in particular
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly active fields
of research.14 Iron and nitrogen doped carbonbased (FeNC)
catalysts show high ORR activity and have thus emerged as a
promising alternative to platinumbased catalysts in fuel cells.
