Description:
A three-centre two-electron bond formed as a result of hydride sharing.

Furthermore, the 
intermediacy of a threecentre twoelectron BHB bond formed as a 
result of the hydride sharing of AB molecule to the catalyst boron 
centre has been suggested to be pivotal in such dehydrogenation 
reactions. Notably, the presence of Lewis acid sites would warrant 
ligation from nucleophilic solvent molecules. It has been proposed 
previously that the Frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) comprising strong
donor ethereal solvent (THF) and the Lewis acidic triaryl boranes 
actively participate in H2 activation.
