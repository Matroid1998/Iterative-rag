Description:
A gas that can be absorbed by materials like MOFs for high uptake and long-term cycling stability.

Text:
Because such attributes 
could contribute to high H2 uptake2a, 3 and longterm cycling stability,2a, 4 extensive efforts have 
been devoted to discovering new MOF materials both through experimental methods and 
computational approaches.5 Indeed, nearly a million MOF structures have been either 
experimentally synthesized or computationally predicted,6 and these have been incorporated into 
various searchable MOF databases.5bf 
Among experimental MOF databases, the CoRE MOF database (computationalready, 
experimental MOF database),5b composed of the MOF structures obtained from the Cambridge 
Structural Database7 and journals,8 has been widely used in computational highthroughput 
screening.
