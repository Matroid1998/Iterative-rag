Description:
Acts as a layered material facilitating hydrogen isotope separation via its interstitial space.

Text:
. Recently, Hu et al.1 reported hydrogen isotope separation by sieving through the 
interstitial space of layered materials, namely, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and molybdenum 
disulfide (MoS2). While the difference in the entry barrier of the hydrogen isotopes into the 
interstitial space of the layered materials was found to be the driving factor for the isotope 
separation, there is no conclusive picture yet on the chemical interaction of interstitial hydrogen 
with the layered materials, and on the transport mechanism through them.
