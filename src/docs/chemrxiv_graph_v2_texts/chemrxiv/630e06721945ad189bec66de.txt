Description:
A catalyst used in asymmetric N,S-acetal formation.

Text:
used average steric occupancy (ASO) and ESPMAX descriptors to predict highselectivity 
ligands in asymmetric N,Sacetal formation using chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyst.12, 13 Grzybowski et al. found that Hammett and TSEI descriptors worked well in predicting major regio, site, and diastereoselective 
products of DielsAlder (DA) reaction.14 They also tried to predict reaction yield (high or low) using simple RDKit 
and chemicallinguistic descriptors, which gave unsatisfied results.15 Glorius et al. used multiple fingerprint 
features, the traditional molecular representation used in QSAR studies,16 for different reaction tasks and achieved 
comparable results.17 Luo et al. combined fingerprint and physicochemical descriptors for reaction prediction.18 
However, these descriptors are not easy to interpret nor generalize well outside the training reaction space except 
the Hammett and TSEI descriptors.
