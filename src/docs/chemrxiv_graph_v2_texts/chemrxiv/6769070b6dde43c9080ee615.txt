The
DigCat online platform then leverages its repository of knowledge and models to execute an
autonomous workow for catalyst design. This design process involves ve key steps. First, the system utilizes LLMs combined with
experimental performance and structural databases of catalytic materials. By analyzing ex
isting material compositions and structures, it generates potential material structure and
composition schemes. In addition to analyzing catalystspecic databases, the platform also
integrates databases from other material domains, such as solid electrolytes, thermoelectric
materials, and lithium battery electrode materials. By leveraging stability and fundamen
tal performance insights from these broader material databases, the platform signicantly
