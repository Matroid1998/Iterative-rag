Description:
A derivative used in selective inhibitors with a 16 carbon long alkyl chain.

Text:
FT895 is a hydroxamic acid based 
HDAC11 selective inhibitor that was reported by Forma Therapeutics 9 and could significantly reduce 
nonsmall cell lung cancer cells viability 10. Recently, Bai et al. reported the development of PB94, 
which also bears a hydroxamic acid moiety as zinc binding group and demonstrated beneficial effect in a 
neuropathic pain mouse model 11. Since the defattyacylase activity of HDAC11 is confirmed 12, 13, 
the ability of HDAC11 to accommodate longer alkyl chain was exploited for the design and development 
of selective inhibitors as the alkyl hydrazide derivative SIS17 which bears a 16 carbon long alkyl chain 
14 and the natural product trapoxin A analogue TD034 15. Currently, there is no crystal structure reported for HDAC11.
