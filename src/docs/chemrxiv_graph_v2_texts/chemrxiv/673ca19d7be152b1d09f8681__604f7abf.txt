Theory suggests that the bulk of this 
fluxional mixture consists of relatively unreactive, large cages or 
other structures built up of tetrahedral O3AlMe and trigonal O 
groups in sixmembered, or larger (MeAlO)n rings.6,7 Reactive 
structures consist of strained cages, analogous to those 
adopted by the tbutylaluminoxanes,8 especially those with 
vicinal (MeAlO)2 rings,9 extended cages10 or nanotubes11 with 
reactive groups formed via the addition of structural Me3Al to 
the vertices and ends of these structures,12 and two
dimensional sheet models with reactive sites incorporating 
structural Me3Al along their edges.13 Recently, a component of 
this complex mixture was finally isolated and characterized by 
Xray crystallography.14 It has a formula of (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 
(hereinafter 26,9) and a molecular weight of 2156 g mol1, with 
a sheet structure and was used to activate metallocenes.
