Organic ECH reactions for a series of functional groups have been reported, including CO, CC, 
CC and CN (Fig 1A). (1528) However, these systems typically rely on precious metal catalysts, 
such as Pt and Pd. (22, 29, 30) Moreover, in aqueous media, these cathode materials face the 
competition with the more facile hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which usually requires less 
negative potentials, compromising the Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards the target ECH products. One strategy to minimize the competing HER is to work in alkaline media, wherein the 
concentration of protons is much lower.

(33) Hence, we envisioned the presence of a surface coverage of moderately bound H 
atoms to be crucial to effectively promote ECH in alkaline media while minimizing the competing 
HER. Recent computational studies have proven valuable in rationalizing the ECH of organic 
compounds on Pd systems based on the binding of key reaction intermediates. (24, 25) However, 
to the best of our knowledge, the influence of the electrode surface coverage on the ECH 
activityselectivity has not yet been reported in the literature. We believe this knowledge is critical 
to rationally design highperformance ECH electrocatalysts based on earthabundant elements, 
which explains why such materials have remained elusive.
