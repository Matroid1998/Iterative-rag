Description:
Functionalities introduced into alkanes during enantioselective oxidation of C(sp3)H bonds.

Text:
Direct enantioselective functionalization of C(sp3)H bonds in organic molecules is one of the 
ultimate goals of organic synthesis due to its remarkable atomeconomy and stepeconomy (16). Methods such as the enantioselective oxidation of the C(sp3)H bonds, which involve directly 
introducing oxygen functionalities into alkanes, hold significant potential for the discovery and 
development of new pharmaceuticals (79). Chiral oxygenated aliphatic structures are common in 
bioactive compounds such as natural products and pharmaceuticals (10, 11). Recent progress has 
been made in enantioselective CC and CN bond formation from C(sp3)H bonds using transition
metal catalysts (1216). However, the enantioselective formation of CO bonds by C(sp3)H 
oxidation remains a formidable challenge (Fig. 1A) (1724).

Description:
A harder base that coordinates strongly with hard acids according to the HSAB theory.

Text:
This difficulty stems from oxygens 
tendency as a harder base to coordinate strongly with hard acids according to the Hard and Soft 
Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory (2526). Oxygen often exhibits poor coordination with late
transition metals, which are soft acids (2729). This mismatch results in low reactivity and 
enantioselectivity in these oxidation reactions and frequently causes overoxidation to ketones. (30). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024hqqb0 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000247003765 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
