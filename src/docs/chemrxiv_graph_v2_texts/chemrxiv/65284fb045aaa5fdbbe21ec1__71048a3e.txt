Description:
Present in red mud with properties such as sintering resistance and resistance to poisoning.

Text:
Alumina (Al2O3) producing from Bauxite through the wellknown Jesef Bayer process
So, under this process, a byproduct is generation (red mud) which is viewed as waste under the Al2O3 production
and might be a challenge for this process. However, as thoughts in Sushils research 26, red mud could be as
catalyst and it might be good alternative to the present commercial catalysts. So that due its properties such as
iron content in form of ferric oxide (Fe2O3), sintering resistance, goodly surface area, resistance to poisoning,
and as well as its cheapest price make it an attractive prospect catalyst for many reactions and beyond. Therefore,
in this paper, it is revised from bauxite to (Al2O3Al) as an alternative strategical advanced materials for high
tech uses
