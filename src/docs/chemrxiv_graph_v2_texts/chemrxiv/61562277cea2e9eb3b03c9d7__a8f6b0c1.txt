Description:
Used to create a homogenous mixture in the synthesis process.

Text:
This study aims to discuss the proper methodology for synthesizing U3O8 using the silica 
gel matrix for enhanced catalysis reactions in an aqueous environment at atmospheric pressure, 
provide the proper techniques on creating simple costeffective composites, with the addition of 
acetic acid (CHCOOH), Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and standard no acid to create a homogenous 
mixture after heat treatment was conducted on uranyl acetate for final confirmation; the protocol 
with the two acids can aid in providing homogenous mixture similar to no acid catalysis.
