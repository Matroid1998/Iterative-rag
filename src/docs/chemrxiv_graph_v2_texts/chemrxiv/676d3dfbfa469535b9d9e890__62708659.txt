Description:
Higher oxidation state species proposed to form in the oxide path mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Text:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical process in various renewable energy technologies, 
including water splitting, metalair batteries, and fuel cells. It involves a complex fourelectron transfer 
mechanism, which renders it kinetically sluggish and a significant bottleneck in overall system efficiency 
1, 2. The electrochemistry of the OER encompasses several proposed mechanisms, including the adsorbate 
evolution mechanism (AEM), the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), and the oxide path mechanism (OPM) 
3.The AEM is the most widely accepted, involving the formation of various oxygencontaining 
intermediates on the catalyst surface. The LOM suggests the participation of lattice oxygen atoms in the 
reaction, while the OPM proposes the formation of higher oxidation state metaloxo species 3, 2 
Interestingly, recent studies have revealed a correlation between pseudocapacitive behavior and OER 
performance.
