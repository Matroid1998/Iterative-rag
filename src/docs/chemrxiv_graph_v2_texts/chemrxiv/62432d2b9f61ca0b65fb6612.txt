Description:
A ternary compound with a cubic fluoritelike structure, where C and N atoms occupy the fluorite F8 cube corners.

Text:
Whereas SiC is a rather wellstudied binary compound that is widely used as an abrasive 1, 
ternary compounds of the SiCN system are illstudied. In 1965, equiatomic SiCN was reported as made by SiC crystals grown in nitrogen atmosphere 2. The stated structure shown in Fig. 1a is a cubic fluoritelike one with face centered Si substructure, 
and C and N atoms occupying the fluorite F8 cube corners. Later, Chen et al. 3 identified 
crystalline and amorphous SiCN in the process of thin films growth by microwave CVD; but no 
crystal structure was reported.

Description:
A hard material with a hardness value of 30 GPa for the crystalline phase and 22 GPa for the amorphous phase.

Text:
The conducted nanoindentation study revealed a hardness value of 
30 GPa for the crystalline phase and 22 GPa for the amorphous phase, therefore, the authors claim 
that SiCN is a hard material rivaling cubic BN is unjustified. In 1997, Riedel et al. 4 claimed the 
first ternary crystalline solid of the Si2C2N4 stoichiometry built of SiN4 tetrahedra (blue, Fig. 1c) 
interconnected via carbon atoms, thus leading to N3SiNCNSiN3like chains of tetrahedra along 
vertical caxis, corner sharing along horizontal xy planes. This feature is also characteristic of the 
novel SiCN proposed herein except for a mixed NC coordination polyhedron for Si.
