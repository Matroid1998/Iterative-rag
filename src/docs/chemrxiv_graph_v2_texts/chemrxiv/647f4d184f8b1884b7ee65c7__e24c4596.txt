brational sum frequency generation spectroscopic mea
surements demonstrated that the presence of a C12E6
monolayer at the AWI enhances the interfacial binding
affinity of SDS compared to that of SDS binding to the
bare AWI.12 Umbrella sampling (US)24,25 molecular dy
namics (MD) simulations corroborated this interpreta
tion, showing a twofold enhancement of the free energy
of DS(the surfactant part of SDS) binding to the air
C12E6water interface (ACWI) compared to the free en
ergy of binding to the AWI.
