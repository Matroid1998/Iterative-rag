Description:
A composition explored for its selective Zn behavior.

Text:
The 10 atoms in the unit cell are 
distributed among four independent crystallographic sites, with the neighbouring Cu and Zn being 
perfectly ordered in nature. While investigating the homogeneity range of Cu6Zn2Sb2, two different 
compositions were further explored, i.e. Cu5.5 Zn2.5Sb2 and Cu5Zn3Sb2, where Zn selectively chooses
