Description:
Can form reactive metabolites which covalently bind to liver proteins and cause hepatotoxicity.

In the history of drug discovery, the development of covalent inhibitors was for a long time
neglected due to safety concerns. This apprehension mostly came from studies revealing that
certain compounds, such as bromobenzene or acetaminophen, can form reactive metabolites
which covalently bind to liver proteins and cause hepatotoxicity.1,2 In spite of these con
cerns, covalent drugs such as aspirin, betalactam antibiotics, or protonpump inhibitors
have proven to be safe and effective.3,4 The strength of the covalent interaction between
the ligand and the target reduces the offrate and increases the residence time of the ligand
in its target. Therefore, covalent drugs offer certain advantages over classical noncovalent
ones.
