Description:
Chosen as the ideal form of energy because of the high heat of combustion and total net zero carbon emissions.

Text:
Due to the excessive exploitation and use of nonrenewable energy sources such as fossil fuels, the global 
energy crisis has become even more severe with several environmental pollutions 1. Global environmental 
pollution caused by fossil fuels has gathered increasing attention in recent years as a serious worldwide 
problem 23. Hydrogen energy is chosen as the ideal form of energy because of the high heat of 
combustion, total net zero carbon emissions and may completely replace the dependency of the industrial 
sector on fossil fuels 4. The more focused investment in clean hydrogen energy has been boosted by the 
rebound from the COVID19 pandemicrelated downturn and the subsequent response to the global energy 
crisis 58.

Description:
Generated through processes such as dissociation of hydrogen storage materials, photocatalytic water splitting, and methane pyrolysis.

Text:
The dissociation of hydrogen storage materials, photocatalytic water splitting, 
photoelectrochemical electrolysis, methane pyrolysis, steam reforming of natural gas and photo reforming 
of biomass are important processes for generating hydrogen 914. The water oxidation half reaction of 
overall water splitting is sluggish, energetically demanding and often handled by improving the 
performance of photocatalysts including the inclusion of cocatalysts, elemental doping, Zscheme 
arrangements, morphological control, and the quantum confinement effect 1518.
