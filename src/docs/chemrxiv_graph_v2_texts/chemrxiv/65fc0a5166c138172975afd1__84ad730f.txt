Magnesium and its alloys are attractive and promising materials for the aerospace, 
56 
automotive, and medical industries due to their low density, excellent formability, nontoxicity, 
57 
and damping properties 14. However, unlike aluminum and titanium, Mg alloys are 
58 
characterized by a low corrosion resistance due to their high reactivity and the absence of a stable 
59 
passive oxide layer 58. At present, the main ways of tailoring mechanical and corrosion 
60 
properties of magnesium alloys are alloying, surface modification, as well as the use of corrosion 
61 
inhibitors 2,911. 62 
The main groups of Mg alloys used in industry are MgAlZn, MgCa, and MgREEs (rare
63 
earth elements) alloys 6,7,12. The AZseries MgAlZn alloys account for more than 90 of 
64 
currently used magnesium alloys 13.

Description:
Forms a solid solution with aluminum and Mg17Al12, enhancing corrosion potential and reducing corrosion rate.

Text:
Alloying with aluminum makes it possible to increase the 
65 
strength, hardness, casting properties, and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys 2,14. The 
66 
microstructure of such alloys is a solid solution of aluminum and phase (Mg17Al12) in Mg, the 
67 
presence of which increases the corrosion potential and reduces its corrosion rate. 68 
Continuous technological development and search for new energysaving technologies 
69 
have promoted further development of ultralight and superplastic structural materials 15,16. 70 
Among them, magnesiumlithium (MgLi) alloys are the lightest metal engineering materials 
71 
16,17.

Description:
Forms alloys with lithium that have improved ductility due to crystal structure transformation.

Text:
According to the binary phase diagram of the MgLi system 18, alloying of magnesium 
72 
with lithium improves the ductility of the alloy due to the transformation of the crystal structure 
73 
from a hexagonal closepacked (hcp) with a lithium content of less than 5.7 wt. (phase is a 
74 
solid solution of lithium in magnesium) to bodycentered cubic (bcc) with a Li content of more 
75 
than 11.3 wt. (phase, a solid solution of magnesium in lithium). In turn, magnesium alloys 
76 
containing 5.711.3 wt. of Li have both hcp and bcc crystal structures 16,19,20. Due to the 
77 
simultaneous presence of the  and phases, such magnesium alloys are characterized by 
78 
medium strength and high ductility 21.
