Description:
A ring structure formed from the conversion of cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene in CPP synthesis.

Two 
major methods for the synthesis of CPPs have been reported (i) converting C6 units, 
such as cyclohexane and cyclohexadiene, of macrocyclic precursors into benzene 
rings21,22, and (ii) reductive elimination from macrocyclic metalarene complexes 
(metal  Pt, Ni, Au)2325. However, even partially fluorinated CPPs (F86CPP, 
F129CPP, F812CPP, F410CPP, F412CPP) synthesized by the groups of Yamago 
and Jasti2628 require multiple steps (method (i), Fig. 1b), and there has no successful 
synthesis of CPP derivatives from orthofunctionalized aryl groups by the Pt method17
19. We hypothesized that PFCPPs can be obtained in onepot based on method (ii). Considering that the reductive elimination of perfluorobiphenyl occurs from the stable 
(2,2bipyridyl)Ni(C6F5)2 complex promoted by acids or oxidants29,30, we assumed that
