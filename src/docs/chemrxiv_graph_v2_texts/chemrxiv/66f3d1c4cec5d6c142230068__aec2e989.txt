Description:
Used as a set retarding agent during clinker grinding.

Text:
This phenomenon, known as a flash set, is attributed to the formation of
28
AFm phases (C2AH8 and C4AH13), which form as platelets, causing rapid stiffening of the paste 4, 6. 29
Over time, the metastable AFm phases undergo partial or complete transformation into the more stable
30
hydrate phase katoite (or hydrogarnet, C3AH6) 711. 31
Calcium sulfate sources like gypsum or anhydrite are added during clinker grinding to act as set
32
retarding agents 12, 13. This addition not only slows down the initial C3A reaction, thereby preventing
33
a flash set but also redirects the hydration pathway of C3A towards ettringite formation 10, 14.

Description:
Retards early C3A hydration by adsorption of sulfate or calcium sulfate ion-pair complexes.

Text:
The
34
retardation of the early C3A hydration in the presence of calcium sulfate is attributed largely due to the
35
adsorption of sulfate or calcium sulfate ionpair complexes 6, 1519. The precipitation of ettringite
36
significantly impacts the initial material characteristics, particularly the rheological properties of OPC
37
based pastes and mortars. Jakob et al. demonstrated the critical role of ettringite in the earlystage
38
rheology of OPC pastes 1, and Goaszewski showed that the yield value of mortars is influenced by
39
the conversion of C3A to ettringite 2. Furthermore, the static yield stress of a model cement pastes
40
containing C3A and C3S depends exponentially on the C3A phase content of the model cement 20.
