Description:
An orally available RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor used for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19.

Therefore, in the battle against 
COVID19, developing specific antiviral drugs for SARSCoV
2 is a top goal, especially with the rise of mutations that may 
partially evade neutralization by antibodies.1 A variety of 
SARSCoV2 inhibitors have already been reported.25 
However, only few directacting antivirals, such as remdesivir, 
molnupiravir, and nirmatrelvir (Figure 1), have been approved. Remdesivir is an intravenously administered RNAdependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor for COVID19 infection,6 
while molnupiravir is an orally available RdRp inhibitor used 
for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of COVID19.

Description:
A repurposed drug.

Text:
It 
should be noted that remdesivir as well as molnupiravir are 
repurposed drugs.6,7 Nirmatrelvir, a peptidomimetic inhibitor of 
the SARSCoV2 main protease (Mpro), is commercialized 
under the brand name Paxlovid in combination with ritonavir to 
prevent its fast metabolic degradation.8 The cysteine protease 
Mpro, crucial for virus replication, is highly conserved across 
coronaviruses but lacks a close homolog in humans. Following 
the approval of Paxlovid, numerous compounds that inhibit 
Mpro have been reported.917
