Description:
A nucleobase that typically pairs with guanine through hydrogen bonding.

Text:
Unlike normal guanine, 8oxoG can more readily form
a hydrogenbonded pair with adenine (A) instead of cytosine (C), resulting in CG to AT
mutations during replication.10,11 Calculations at the singlefew basenucleotide level sug
gest that 8oxoG has an even lower VIE than G.1215 Moreover, computational investigations
showed that Grich5,11,15,16 and 8oxoGcontaining11,15 fragments of up to 3 base pairs have
lower IEs than single G and 8oxoG fragments, consistent with experimental studies9,17,18
