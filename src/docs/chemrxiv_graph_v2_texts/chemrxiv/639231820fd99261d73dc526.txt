Description:
A key contributor to macroscopic properties such as melting point through hydrogen bonding.

However, melting data is not
readily available for all the quinones and hydroquinones of interest, so having a model that
predicts the melting points of quinone and hydroquinone molecules is highly desirable.22
Various approaches are employed to predict organic compound melting points.2325 Many
models employ group contribution methods (GCMs).26,27 These are additive methods that
sum the contributions from all of the functional groups within a molecule. However, these
methods do not account for intermolecular interactions between functional groups on dier
ent molecules.28 Treating molecules as isolated species neglects eects such as Van der Waals
(VdW) and hydrogen bonding, which are key contributors to macroscopic properties such
as melting point. Karthikeyan et al.29 recognized this in their machinelearning (ML) based
approach to predicting melting points of organic chemicals.
