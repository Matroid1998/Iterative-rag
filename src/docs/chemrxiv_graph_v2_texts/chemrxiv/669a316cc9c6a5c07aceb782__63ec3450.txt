Description:
A catalyst used in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol.

Text:
The chemical potentials of reactants, products, and intermediates affect the architectures
of catalysts,13 however, the dynamics under reaction conditions remain poorly understood. Tracking these changes requires using complex operando techniques, the results of which are
often difficult to obtain and to interpret due to the average nature of the signals, or the
presence of spectators.2,4 To give an example, structural rearrangements were inferred from
changes in kinetic regimes when using microkinetics for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol
with CuZnO.1 However, models that elucidate the implications of dynamic catalysts on
performance are currently unavailable. Catalytic systems based on firstrow transition metals like Cu and Ni undergo surface
rearrangements in the presence of carbon species, such as CO or CHx fragments.
