ization and proton tunneling substantially influence structure and dynamics of water.12,14
In enzymes, strong hydrogen bonds and associated NQEs play a crucial role in lowering
activation barriers and facilitating rapid and efficient chemical transformations.15
Many theoretical methods have been developed to incorporate NQEs, mainly including
quantum dynamics methods,16,17 pathintegral approaches,18,19 and multicomponent quan
tum chemistry methods.2022 Recently, constrained nuclearelectronic orbital density func
tional theory23 (CNEODFT) was developed within the multicomponent quantum chemistry
framework and has been shown to efficiently and accurately describe vibrational modes in
volving hydrogen atoms.24 Unlike other multicomponent quantum chemistry methods, the
CNEO framework is based on the key physical fact that, while quantum nuclei have density
distributions in space similar to electrons, yet they are much more localized than those of
electrons.
