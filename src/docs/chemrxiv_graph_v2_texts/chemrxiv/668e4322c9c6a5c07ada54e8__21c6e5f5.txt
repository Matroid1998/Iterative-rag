Description:
Colloidal nanocrystals used in photoluminescent applications like tandem solar cells and LEDs.

Colloidal cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3, X  Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals (PNCs) are the most 
promising photoluminescent inorganic selfassemblies owing to their cuttingedge applications in 
tandemsolar cell, lightemitting diodes and photo(electro)catalysis.14 However, these 
photoluminescent nanocrystals remain far from practical applicability due to their poor ambient 
stability.57 Coulombic interaction guided dynamic binding between ammonium ions (of 
oleylamine) with bromide ions present in crystal lattice and oleate ions (of oleic acid) with lattices 
cesium ions falls apart in presence of water molecule, as oleate becomes oleic acid and leaves 
hydroxide ion. This hydroxide ion readily forms lead hydroxide salt, Pb(OH)2 with crystals Pb(II) 
ion.8 Very recently Ma et al.
