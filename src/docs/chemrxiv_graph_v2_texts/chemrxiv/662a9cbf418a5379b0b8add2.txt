Description:
Compounds that undergo degradation involving the cleaving of PO bonds to eliminate phosphate groups.

Text:
Organophosphate degradation, also known as dephosphorylation, involves cleaving PO bonds to 
eliminate phosphate groups. This process holds significance in various chemical contexts, from the 
degradation of environmentally harmful phosphorylated compounds such as nerve agents and pesticides to
