Carbon capture has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
29 
across diverse industrial processes, addressing the challenge of climate change.1 Within adsorptive 
30 
technologies for carbon capture, MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs) have attracted considerable 
31 
interest as selective CO2 adsorbents due to their modular, tunable properties.2, 3 
32 
Over the years, more than 100,000 MOFs have been synthesized and reported in the literature4, 
33 
5, and trillions of materials have been hypothesized to exist using the Legolike principles of MOF 
34 
construction.6, 7 This presents a challenge in identifying the most suitable materials for carbon 
35 
capture applications.
