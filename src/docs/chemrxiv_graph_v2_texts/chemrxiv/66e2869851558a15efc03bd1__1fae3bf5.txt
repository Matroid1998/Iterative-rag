Description:
A highly crystalline compound semiconductor requiring precise control of elemental composition, doping concentration, and crystallinity.

Text:
For example, highly crystalline compound semiconductors, like Al1
xGaxN, require precise control of the elemental composition, doping concentration, and 
crystallinity, whilst amorphous dielectric oxides are usually less complicated to deposit. The deposition is often based on chemical reactions, and the more challenging the 
process the more precise control over the chemistry is required.
