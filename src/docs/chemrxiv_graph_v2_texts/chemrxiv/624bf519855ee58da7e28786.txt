Description:
A versatile coordination cage topology known for its host-guest chemistry, capable of binding anions and neutral species.

Amongst the many hundreds of coordination cages to appear in the past 30 years, the Pd2L4 
topology, first described by Steel,1 is the simplest, arguably the most versatile and one of the 
most wellstudied.27 It has been investigated in multiple contexts, as its hostguest chemistry 
can be tuned to bind anions,8 as well as neutral species.910 This versatility has allowed it to be 
exploited for a number of applications that involve the binding of drug5 and imaging molecules,11 
as well as substrates for catalysis.1213 Paramagnetic M2L4 lantern cages are much less well 
explored,14 indeed investigations of the magnetic behaviour of any supramolecular cages 
remains virtually unexplored.15 However, the hostguest chemistry of these systems offers a 
range of potential advantages for the exploitation of magnetic materials properties.
