Description:
Demonstrated an ultranarrow 5D0 7F0 transition linewidth paired with a near-millisecond coherence time.

Text:
However, stoichiometric rare
earth materials with drastically higher rare
earth concentrations and improved site homo
geneity can reduce inhomogeneous linewidths
to the point that transitions involving hyperfine
energy levels separated by only 70140 MHz
are resolved.5 Promisingly, EuCl36H2O has
demonstrated an ultranarrow 5D0 7F0 tran
sition linewidth paired with a nearmillisecond
coherence time,69 but its environmental insta
bility and needed isotopic enrichment prompt
searches for additional candidates. A desirable candidate would be air stable,
have a large europium cation separation to limit
