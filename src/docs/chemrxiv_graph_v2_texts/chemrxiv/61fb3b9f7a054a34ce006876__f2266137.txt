Description:
Reactive dimerization can be analyzed using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.

Ab initio 
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been 
widely applied to reveal the atomic insights of complex 
reactive systems based on fundamental equations of 
quantum and classical mechanics. Although AIMD has 
been successfully used for polyyne inception 17 and 
PAH reactive dimerization 16, AIMD calculations of 
large PAH moleculesradicals are still challenging due 
to the high computational cost despite impressive 
progress in computing hardware and software in recent 
decades. Over the past decade, many empirical 
potentials (or force fields) have been developed to 
mimic electronic structure calculations potential 
energy surface (PES). Such empirical potentials, 
including ReaxFF 18,19 and REBO 20, trade 
accuracy for a lower computational expense, making it 
possible to extend simulation scales to orders of 
magnitude beyond AIMD methods.
