Carbohydrate 
moieties 
on 
glycosylated 
small molecules play specific roles that 
attenuate their biological activities.1,2,3 In 
addition to their influence on physicochemical 
properties, sugar residues often serve as 
handles that mediate binding interactions 
between the small molecule and its target, 
and 
underpin 
their 
associated 
activity. Glycosylated natural products4 epitomize this 
phenomenon, where the sugars on macrolide 
antibiotics are illustrative. The producer of the 
bacterial translation inhibitor methymycin, for 
example, adopts a prodrug strategy using a 
glucose moiety (Fig. 1).5 When glucose is 
attached to the desosamine residue of the 
macrolide, the compound does not fit into the 
binding site in the ribosome exit tunnel. Removal of glucose by a glycosidase, which is 
concomitant with export, weaponizes the 
macrolide.
