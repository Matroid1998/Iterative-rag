The global initiative to reduce methane emissions from the energy sector has gained substan
35
tial momentum because of its pivotal role in combating global warming. 2 Methane emissions
36
are the second most prevalent greenhouse gas (GHG) after CO2, with a global warming po
37
tential (GWP) that is 863 times higher than CO2, over a 20year time frame. Accurately
38
quantifying these emissions stands as a fundamental prerequisite in the pursuit of eective
39
methane emission reduction policies. 40
The natural gas system is the second largest anthropogenic source of methane in the
41
U.S., spanning from production and processing to transmission and distribution.
