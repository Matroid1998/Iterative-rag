Description:
Used in preclinical studies as an indicator of hypoxia.

Text:
These enzymes have been exploited to 
develop hypoxia sensing prodrugs714 and imaging agents, including pimonidazole and EF5 that are routinely 
used in preclinical studies as indicators of hypoxia (Figure 1).1517 Both pimonidazole and EF5 contain 
nitroimidazole groups that are reduced by reductases in hypoxia to generate products that are covalently trapped 
and can be detected using immunostaining. In contrast, hypoxia sensing fluorescent probes18 are powerful tools 
that allow the detection and imaging of hypoxia with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, but no need 
for subsequent detection steps involving immunostaining. In general, such probes function by having their 
emission properties suppressed by addition of a bioreductive group, examples of which include nitroarenes,8,18 
quinones,19 azo,2023 or azide24 groups, which undergo reductasecatalyzed reactions to reveal the fluorophore in 
an oxygendependent manner.
