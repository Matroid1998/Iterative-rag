Description:
An inert gas used for purging to achieve anaerobic conditions in chemical reactions.

Graftingto is generally easier
to perform, and allows better control over the chain
length (distribution), but suffers from a drawback at
tainable grafting densities are typically low as steric
hindrance of already grafted chains precludes the graft
ing of additional chains. Polymer brushes can be prepared in a graftingfrom
manner using surfaceinitiated polymerizations such as
atomtransfer radical polymerization (SIATRP) 14,
15. However, conventional ATRP has a couple of draw
backs, most notably the fact that it is oxygensensitive
and thus has to be carried out under anaerobic condi
tions. This complicates synthesis of polymer brushes
using ATRP significantly in a few ways. Most import
antly, it requires the use of airtight reaction vessels
and rigorous deoxygenation of reaction solutions (e.g. by purging with an inert gas like nitrogen).
