Description:
Aminoborane-doped variants have electron-hole transport properties attractive to the semiconductor industry.

Text:
Aminoboranes (R2NBR2) are a class of molecules comprised of a 
nitrogen and boron atom covalently coordinated. The NB bond is 
further strengthened by donation from the nitrogen lone pair to 
the empty porbital on boron leading to an enthalpically favorable, 
partially sp2hybridized bond (Figure 1a).1 Since their discovery, 
aminoboranes have captivated chemists across a variety of disci
plines (Figure 1b). Unsubstituted aminoboranes have been of inter
est to materials chemists, who identified them as a promising source 
of H2 gas for use in fuel cells2 while aminoboranedoped poly aro
matic hydrocarbons have electronhole transport properties that are 
attractive to the semiconductor industry.3 In organic chemistry, chi
ral bicyclic aminoboranes are versatile enantioselective catalysts for 
numerous reductions and cycloadditions4 among other uses.5
