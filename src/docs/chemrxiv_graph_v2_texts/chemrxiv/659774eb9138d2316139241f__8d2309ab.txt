Description:
A product of CO2 conversion used in industrial or synthetic applications.

Text:
The steady rise of atmospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel use has resulted in increasing global 
average temperatures.13 Due to environmental concerns and developing economic incentives, a 
number of technologies have been developed for transforming captured CO2 to more useful 
molecules as a feedstock for other chemical processes.47 One promising example is the use of 
nonthermal plasmas to convert CO2 into CO and O2, with the product CO of use to other 
industrial or synthetic applications.814 The dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor is 
commonly used for this reaction, as it relatively straightforward to construct and is capable of 
producing a nonthermal plasma with relatively highenergy electrons (110 eV) and low bulk 
gas temperatures.9,1416 These high energy electrons are capable of directly splitting CO2 into CO 
and O2.
