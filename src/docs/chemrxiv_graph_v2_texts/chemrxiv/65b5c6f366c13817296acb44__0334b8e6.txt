Description:
Unlikely to be the primary constituents of the earliest membranes found in protocells.

Text:
Thus, it is unlikely that diacyl phospholipids were the primary constituents of the earliest membranes found in protocells. Instead, the first protocell membranes could have formed from substances that were either abundant on the early Earth 
or were derived from much simpler precursors through spontaneous chemical reactions (47 . Fatty acids have been shown to be generated under prebiotically plausible conditions and have also been found in 
certain meteorites, suggesting that fatty acids were likely present on the early Earth (811 . Nonenzymatic fatty acid 
synthesis results in predominantly shortchain species, with chain lengths below 10 carbons (1012 . However, due to 
the presence of a single hydrophobic tail, only longchain fatty acids (C12 can assemble into membrane structures at 
low millimolar concentrations (1315 .
