Description:
A herbicide that can be decarboxylated by fatty-acid photodecarboxylases.

Although the direct excitation of organic compounds by light to facilitate chemical 
reactions has been known for more than a century, the recent rise of photoredox catalysis has 
significantly expanded the scope of photochemistry in the synthesis of organic molecules.13 Apart 
from enabling new reaction pathways not accessible by thermal control, the use of photon energy 
is also considered a sustainable approach.4,5 Akin to photocatalysis, biocatalysis has been shown 
to enable sustainable reaction methodologies due to its generally mild reaction conditions, use 
of aqueous media, high stereo and chemoselectivity, and everincreasing substrate and reaction 
scope.613 
At the interface of these two fields of catalysis, photobiocatalysis arose, whereby either 
the enzyme itself requires light (naturally or by promiscuity) or photoinduced electrons are 
transferred to it.1417 The scope of photobiocatalytic transformations was significantly expanded 
following the discovery of fattyacid photodecarboxylases in 2017.18 This class of natural 
photoenzymes has subsequently shown great promise for the production of biofuels,1922 and 
apart from its natural substrates, fatty acids, the wildtype enzyme or its variants have been 
demonstrated to decarboxylate hydroxy and aminosubstituted fatty acids,23,24 dicarboxylic 
acids,25 substituted carboxylic acids26 and the herbicide phosphinothricin.27 
According to the BeerLambert law, the penetration of visible light into a medium 
decreases exponentially with increasing path length.
