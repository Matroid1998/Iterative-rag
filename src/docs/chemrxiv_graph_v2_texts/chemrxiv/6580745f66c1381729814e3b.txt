Description:
A component of human adenosine receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors with experimentally resolved structures.

Text:
Structurebased drug design (SBDD) against G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) has benefited from the 
rapid accumulation of experimentally resolved structures of ligandGPCR complexes. Moreover, ligand
based drug design (LBDD) has been developed with the evolution of database and artificial intelligence 
technology. 16 The experimental structures of GPCRs in combination with the application of molecular 
dynamics (MD) simulations 16 and enhanced sampling methods, 4,7 that enables protein flexibility, helps 
towards understanding their conformational heterogeneity 8 and ligand binding. 4,7 Examples of SBDD and 
LBDD and application of MD simulations to understand ligands binding against GPCRs are cited in ref. 4. Experimental structures have been resolved for three out of the four subtypes of human adenosine 
receptors (hARs).
