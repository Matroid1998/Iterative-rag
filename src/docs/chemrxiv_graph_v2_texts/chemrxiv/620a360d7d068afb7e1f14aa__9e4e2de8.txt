Description:
A redox-active molecule used in DNA detection.

Text:
It is a straight
forward electrochemical technique that has been applied for DNA 
detection using redoxactive molecules, such as methylene blue 
(MB) 21, anthraqinone2sulfonic acid monohydrate sodium salt 
(AQMS) 22 or daunomycin (DNR) 23. These molecules have 
different interaction mechanisms to singlestranded (ssDNA) and 
doublestrand DNA (dsDNA). The advantages of such an approach 
include the short time needed to obtain results and the simplicity of 
the system. The attachment of probe DNA in a stable and robust manner re
mains a key challenge in electrochemical sensor development 12.
