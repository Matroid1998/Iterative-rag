Description:
A commercially available compound used as a starting material in the synthesis of the ethyl ester analogue of the duocarmycin SA alkylating subunit.

Efforts to 
translate this activity to clinical advantage have tended to focus 
on targeted systems through prodrugs with bioreductive,68 bio
oxidative,9 esterase10,11 or glycosylase enzymes1216 or through 
antibody,17 peptide18 or small molecule conjugates.19 Many of 
these efforts have focussed on the use of the synthetic 
duocarmycin alkylation subunit known as CBI (2), as it is 
considered to be synthetically accessible, available in six steps 
from commercially available 1,3dihydroxynaphthalene 3,20 
whereas the routes to the natural products tend to be 
significantly longer. In this paper, we describe a new synthesis 
to the ethyl ester analogue 4 of the duocarmycin SA alkylating 
subunit in only ten linear steps from commercially available 
ethyl 5nitroindole2carboxylate 5.
