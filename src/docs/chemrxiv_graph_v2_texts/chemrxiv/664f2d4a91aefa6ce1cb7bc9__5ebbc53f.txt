Description:
Recovered in the open-loop recycling approach to form a circular economy.

Furthermore, propylene 
can also be used for the synthesis of recyclable and bio
degradable 
polymers 
such 
as 
polylactic 
acid 
(PLA), 
polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) or polybutylene 
succinate (PBS). The metathesisbased conversion of PE to 
propylene, therefore, highlights the potential of the openloop 
recycling approach, where a waste material can be utilized as a 
flexible and versatile feedstock. Essentially, it allows 
recovering the carbon atoms and synthesis effort which have 
been invested at the start of the product life cycle. This open
loop approach therefore forms the basis for building a multi
dimensional circular economy in the chemical industry (figure 
1).
