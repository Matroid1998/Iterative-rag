Description:
A highly toxic compound previously used in antifouling paints.

Text:
A ship without protection after 6 months 
will consume 40 more bunker fuel oil (and engine power output) due to additional 
dragging and friction originating from the surface roughness of macro and 
microorganisms foulant organisms accumulating on the unprotected hull.1 Following the 
global ban of highly toxic tributyltinbased paints, the most commonly used AF coatings 
today are based on the biocidal action of copper oxide (Cu2O) and copper thiocyanate 
(CuSCN) typically formulated at 2040 per cent concentrations in combination with 
booster biocides, such as copper or zinc pyrithione, and other synthetic antifungal, 
herbicide, and pesticide synthetic molecules originating from crop protection research in 
agriculture.2 The amount of AF paints globally consumed by the worlds fleet grows at 10 
annual rate.3 Hence, the 80,000 tonne annual consumption estimated by an industrys 
practitioner in 2010,4 now largely exceeds the 100,000 tonne threshold.
