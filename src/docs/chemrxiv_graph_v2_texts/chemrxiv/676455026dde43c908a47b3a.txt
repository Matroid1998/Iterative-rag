Hydrogen production through alkaline water electrol
ysis involves the splitting of water using an electric current
in a basic medium, where the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) occurs at the cathode and the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) at the anode. However, the OER remains
responsible for the major part of the electricity cost of
water electrolysis, mainly because of thermodynamics in
combination with significant overpotentials and sluggish
kinetics. 2
Various catalysts have been proposed over the past
few decades to enhance the efficiency of the OER. While
some noble metalbased catalysts have shown promising
