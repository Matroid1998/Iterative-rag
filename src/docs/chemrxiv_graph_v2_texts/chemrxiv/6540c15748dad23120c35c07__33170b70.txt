Substoichiometric tungsten oxides WO3x, especially nanoscopic forms of W18O49, are 
promising materials due to their many exciting properties, resulting in potential applications in 
various technologies, like electrochromic devices, sensors, etc.15 W18O49 exhibits nearinfrared 
absorption,6,7 which could be exploited for heat shielding,8 heat generation, and water 
evaporation closely connected to recently demonstrated water desalinization.911 The tungsten 
suboxides could also be used in the photoreduction of carbon dioxide,12 photocatalysis,4,5,13,14 
electrocatalysis,4 and photoluminescence.4,5 The tungsten suboxides characteristics, including 
their distorted inner structure, their highly oxygendeficient structure, and their nanoscopic size, 
were examined in many studies.14,1517 The structure containing triangular and hexagonal 
channels allows W18O49 to act as an anodic material for lithiumion batteries.1821 Intercalation 
of lithium ions into the W18O49 structure was studied for triggered lattice contraction, which 
result in macroscopic material flexibility and electrochromic color change.22 W18O49 was 
successfully exploited as a precursor in the largescale synthesis of WS2 nanotubes.23 Another 
feature of this material is its sensory properties for NOx and ammonia gases.2426 
There are several different approaches to preparing nanoscopic W18O49 and other 
tungsten suboxides in nanowhisker or nanofibrous forms that differ from each other in a 
synthetic method or in a different tungstencontaining precursor.
