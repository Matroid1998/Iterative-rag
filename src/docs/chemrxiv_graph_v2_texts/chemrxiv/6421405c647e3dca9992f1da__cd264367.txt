Description:
Reagents that originate from an exothermic reaction of metallic magnesium and a halide in a water-free ethereal solvent.

Organomagnesium halides, also known as Grignard reagents, 
are important intermediates for the formation of new carbon
carbonbonds in synthetic chemistry. In the pharmacy sector 
they became especially useful for the formation of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients, e.g. painreliever ibuprofen and 
breast cancer drug tamoxifen.1 Grignard reagents originate 
from an exothermic reaction of metallic magnesium (mostly 
powder or turnings) and a halide in a water free ethereal 
solvent. Side product formation due to the Wurtz coupling 
reaction can occur, in which a Grignard reagent molecule 
(product) reacts with a halide molecule (educt), diminishing the 
yield of the Grignard reagent.2 Therefore, reducing the contact 
between the formed Grignard reagent and the halide educt 
would prevent Wurtz coupling.
