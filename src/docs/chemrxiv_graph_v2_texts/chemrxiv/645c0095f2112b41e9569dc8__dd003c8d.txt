Description:
Part of Os(II) compounds used for the reduction of pyruvate.

Text:
More recently, Noyoritype Os(II) compounds of general formula Os(arene)(TsDPEN) (TsDPEN, N
(ptoluenesulfonyl)1,2diphenylethylenediamine) (Figure 1) were studied for the reduction of pyruvate using 
formate as a hydride source and under biologically relevant conditions, giving rise to L lactate or Dlactate with 
a high enantiomeric excess13, 16. The toxicity of the compounds was greatly enhanced upon addition of formate 
to the cell culture media. Interestingly, Pizarro et al reported on Os(II) complexes bearing picolinate N,O
chelates and studied their reactivity toward catalytic TH of pyruvate, producing quantifiable excess lactate 
inside cancer cells when using formate as hydridesource17. Finally, in 2022, Sungho Yoon et al. described a 
watersoluble carbene rhodium complex of formula (5Cp)Rh(MDI)Cl MDI  1,1methylenebis(3,3
