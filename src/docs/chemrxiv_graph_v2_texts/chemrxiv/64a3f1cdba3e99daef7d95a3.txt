Description:
Causes low pH that deactivates the enzyme during esterification.

However, the heterogeneous nature of flower waste may raise concerns when studying their 
reaction kinetics for industrial applications. This limitation can be addressed by a stepbystep 
approach, whereby the first step is to focus on the enzymatic modification of the major 
constituents of the essential oil for kinetic studies. Reports on lipasecatalysed transesterification of terpene alcohol mixtures, which is key for 
esterifying essential oils from flower waste, are limited. Paroul et al. 16 investigated the 
enzymatic modification of essential oils, where 90 conversion of geranyl and citronellyl 
oleates and propionates were obtained 6 hours after esterification of citronella essential oil. It 
was observed that esterification has the inherent disadvantage of deactivating the enzyme 
owing to the low pH caused by the acetic acid reagent.
