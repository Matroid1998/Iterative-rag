Description:
A chiral ligand constructed on a biferrocene skeleton, forming seven-membered chelate rings by complexation to a transition metal.

Ferrocenebased chiral ligands have brought great success in catalytic asymmetric 
synthesis.13 Consequently, the development of biferrocenebased derivatives should be an 
attractive direction for designing new chiral ligands. The first chiral ligand constructed on 
biferrocene skeleton was BIFEP in 1991.4 The BIFEP ligands represent a family of 
biferrocenebased ligands which form sevenmembered chelate rings by complexation to a 
transition metal.5,6 Afterwards, the transcoordinating TRAPtypes ligands, which possess 
planar chiralities on the cyclopentadienyl rings and chiral centers at the position of the side 
chain, has been successfully developed and employed in various catalytic asymmetric 
reactions.79 By now, Biferrocenebased diphosphines has served as a type of important and 
wonderful chiral ligands for asymmetric transformations.
