A 
crucial aspect of designing effective drug delivery systems is multicompartmentalization, which enables 
the coloading of biological active cargoes with different solubility profiles or functions, ultimately im
proving their therapeutic efficacy.3 
One promising approach involves pHresponsive polymeric vesicles that exploit the acidic tumour micro
environment to trigger drug release, minimizing offtarget effects.2,4 Curcumin, a natural polyphenol with 
potent antiinflammatory and anticancer properties, holds promise but suffers from poor bioavailability 
and rapid degradation.5,6 Prior methods, including biodegradable microspheres, hydrogels, polymeric na
noparticles, and liposomes, have improved its stability. Encapsulation within pHresponsive polymeric 
vesicles further enhances its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, tumour progression is often driven by 
excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as hyaluronic acid and collagen, which hinder 
drug penetration.
