these materials into the environment. Outside of sealed operational conditions, it has
been demonstrated that complex metal oxides can transform in the environment, and
cause negative biological impact through leaching of cations into aqueous phases. Using
a combined DFT  Thermodynamics analysis, insights into the mechanism and driving
forces of cation release can be studied at the molecularlevel. Here, we describe design
principles that can be drawn from previous collaborative research on complex metal
oxide dissoltuion of the Li(NiyMnzCo1yz)O2 family of materials, and go on to posit
ternary complex metal oxides in the delafossite structure type with controlled release
behavior. Using equistoichiometric formulations, we use DFT  Thermodynamics to
model cation release. The trends are discussed in terms of lattice stability, solution
chemistrysolubility limits, and electronicmagnetic properties.
