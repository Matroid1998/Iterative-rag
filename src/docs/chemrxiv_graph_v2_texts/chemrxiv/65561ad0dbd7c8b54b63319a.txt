Description:
A valuable chemical whose direct conversion from methane is thermodynamically favored over oxidation to CO2.

Text:
. Methane, the secondmost prominent greenhouse gas (GHG), contributes to approximately 
1620 of global GHG emissions1. Converting methane to valuable chemicals (e.g., methanol) is 
seen as a key strategy to reduce methane emissions and therefore has great environmental 
significance and potential economic value. However, the direct conversion of methane to methanol 
is particularly challenging due to the high energy required to activate the strong CH bonds of 
methane, which requires an efficient catalyst to lower the energy barrier, together with the 
thermodynamic favorability of methanol overoxidation to CO22, 3. The optimal catalysts for 
methanetomethanol conversion need to satisfy numerous criteria, driving an exhaustive search 
of catalytic materials4, 5.
