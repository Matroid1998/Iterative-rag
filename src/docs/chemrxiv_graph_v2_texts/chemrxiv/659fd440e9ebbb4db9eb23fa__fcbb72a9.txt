Description:
A type of azine that is a prevalent structural unit in drug molecules.

Text:
Nitrogencontaining heteroarenes are present in 11 of the top 25 most frequently occurring ring systems in U.S. approved 
drugs.12 Of these, Lewis basic azines, such as pyridines, pyrimidines, quinazolines and pyrazines, are some of the most 
prevalent structural units and share the unique properties that make this type of aromatic heterocycle an attractive com
ponent in drug molecules  namely, hydrogen bondacceptor ability and the capacity to interact via nonpolar interactions.1 
Moreover, the nitrogen atom in azine ring systems can confer considerable improvement of key pharmacological param
eters, including biochemical potency, binding affinity, aqueous solubility and metabolic stability.24 The presentation of an 
azine feature connected through the 2position to an alkylamine substituent  a socalled alkyl 2azinyl amine  repre
sents an attractive polar scaffold in the design of pharmaceutical and agrochemical candidates due to the density of polar 
functionality, multiple diversification points for analogue synthesis and a balance of C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon frameworks.
