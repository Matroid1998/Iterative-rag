Description:
A thin-film chalcogenide absorber and current market leader in solar photovoltaic technology.

Text:
Net greenhouse gas emissions have continued to
rise in the last decade, with the largest growth
coming from increased CO2 emissions from the
burning of fossil fuels for energy.3 Solar photo
voltaic absorbers are one of the most promis
ing renewable energy technologies for combat
ting this crisis. In particular, thinfilm chalco
genide absorbers have been fervently investi
gated, offering the possibility of reduced ma
terial and processing costs, improved lowlight
performance and greater manufacturing flexi
bility as compared to conventional silicon solar
cells.46 CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 are the cur
rent marketleaders in this area; however, these
materials suffer from the use of raretoxic el
