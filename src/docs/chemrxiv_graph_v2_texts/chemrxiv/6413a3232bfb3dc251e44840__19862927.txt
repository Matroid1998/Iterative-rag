Involved in a stoichiometric study demonstrating reactivity without added sacrificial oxidant or reductant.

1A).6 In addition, with a 
small change in reaction conditions, SCF3 nucleophiles became 
effective, with 60 examples demonstrated.7 This universality of 
a single method is highly desirable for synthetic organic 
chemistry, especially in medicinal chemistry where these 
reactions are used at a high frequency.89 In the former system, 
we proposed a mechanistic hypothesis involving an energy 
transfer quenching event, supported by literature precedent and 
a stoichiometric nickel study demonstrating that no added 
sacrificial oxidantreductant is needed to promote reactivity  
something necessary for photocatalytic cycle turnover in many 
reductiveoxidative quenching mechanisms. Recent 
mechanistic 
studies1011 
have 
disclosed 
spectroscopic evidence for energy transfer from highly 
reducing PCs (i.e.
