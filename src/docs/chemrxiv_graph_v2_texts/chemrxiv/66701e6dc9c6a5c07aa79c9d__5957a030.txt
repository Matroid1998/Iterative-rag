Description:
A pair used in upconversion processes for applications requiring NIR radiation.

electronic levels and ladderlike energy diagrams with, 
thus, setting up a perfect platform of possible lanthanide to 
lanthanide (LntoLn, Ln  Ln) energy transfer events resulting in up 
and downconversion processes.17 While these processes have been 
extensively 
studied 
on 
solids1820 
and 
more 
recently 
on 
nanoparticles,2124 there is a growing interest in exploring their 
potential at the molecular scale, using stable, well defined and 
reproducible molecular assemblies.25 Regarding upconversion 
processes, improvements have been recently obtained with 
complexes presenting mainly the following pairs TbYb,26, 27 EuYb28 
and YbEr.2931 This antiStokes luminescence process (lowerto
higher energy transfer) bears significant potential for various 
applications that require or utilize NIR radiation, including deep
tissue imaging, cancer therapy, nanothermometry, biosensing, 
display technologies, and solar cells.21, 3234 By contrast, down
conversion 
(highertolower 
energy 
transfer) 
remains 
less 
investigated with the majority of the processes studied in solution.35
