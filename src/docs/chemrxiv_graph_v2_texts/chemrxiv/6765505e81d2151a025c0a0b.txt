Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds, which are weak, subtle intermolecular interactions affecting molecular crystal packing.

Molecular crystals have diverse applications including pharmaceuticals 1, organic electronics 2, optical
materials 3, and materials for gas storage and separation 46. In all cases, the properties of molecular
crystals depend on the crystal packing. For example, pharmaceutical molecules can have widely different
solubilities depending on the crystalline form, and in organic electronics, charge transport is critically
dependent on crystal packing. However, molecular crystal packing is notoriously difficult to predict because
it is dictated by a range of weak, subtle intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces, aromatic
pistacking, and hydrogen bonds 7. This is a major hurdle for digital material design because if we cannot
predict crystal structure then we cannot, by definition, predict the functional properties of the crystal.
