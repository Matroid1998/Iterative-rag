Description:
Forms electrophilic complexes that react with tyrosine for O-functionalization.

Text:
Several elegant methods have been reported for Cmodification 
of tyrosine, such as threecomponent Mannichtype reactions,9 
or reactions with aryldiazonium salts,10 diazodicarboxamides11 
and radicals.12 Ofunctionalization has also been described, with 
for example reaction with electrophilic allyl palladium 
complexes,13 SuFEx reagents14 and glycosylation reactions.15 
Functionalization 
has 
also 
been 
achieved 
via 
dearomatizationrearomatization strategies,16 or formation of 
a rhodium arene complex.17 All these strategies have 
advantages, but also inherent limitations, and therefore the 
development of alternative methods is still highly desirable.
