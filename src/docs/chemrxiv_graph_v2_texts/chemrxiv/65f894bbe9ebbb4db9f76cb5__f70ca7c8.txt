Description:
Proposed as catalysts in cycloaddition reactions under atmospheric CO2 pressure and moderate temperature.

Text:
to produce valueadded commodity 
chemicals.2 Thus, CO2 is an ideal C1 building block for organic synthesis because it is 
inexpensive and abundant and can be considered a waste product.3 

One of those valueadded products obtained from CO2 is cyclic carbonates, which can be 
used industrially as a polar aprotic solvent,4 as an electrolyte for lithiumion batteries,5 
and as intermediates in the manufacture of fine chemicals6 and polymers.7 Cyclic 
carbonates are mostly produced by the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides in the presence 
of a wide range of catalysts,8 including hydrogenbond catalysts,9 ionic liquids,10 
quaternary ammonium salt,11 organic polymers,12 MOFs,13 porous materials,14 layered 
double hydroxide (LDH)15 and metalbased catalysts.16 

Considering that the use of mild reaction conditions remains the principal challenge, 
we propose the use of mixed metal oxides (MMOs) as catalysts in cycloaddition reactions, with 
the objective of being able to carry out the catalytic process under atmospheric CO2 pressure 
and moderate temperature.17
