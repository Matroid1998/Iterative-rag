Description:
A molecule reduced to either water or hydroxide ions in the ORR process.

Text:
The ORR, a cornerstone electrochemical process, underpins the functionality of various energy 
conversion and storage technologies, including protonexchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) 
and metalair batteries 4. ORR encompasses a kinetically complex multielectron transfer 
process, reducing molecular oxygen to either water or hydroxide ions, depending on the electrolyte 
medium. Its inherently sluggish kinetics, attributed to the high activation barrier required to cleave 
the OO bond and coordinate protonelectron transfers, represents a formidable challenge to 
achieving optimal energy efficiency and operational performance in these systems 5. The role of ORR in energy technology is both pivotal and multifaceted. In PEMFCs, the cathodic 
ORR is the ratedetermining step that directly influences the overall power density and energy 
efficiency of the system 6.

Description:
Intermediates stabilized by complexes with catalytic activity in ORR.

Text:
These complexes exhibit remarkable catalytic activity attributed to their distinctive 
electronic configurations, facile redox cycling, and capability to stabilize oxygen intermediates. Their relatively low synthesis cost, combined with their tunable electronic and steric properties, 
positions them as viable alternatives to noble metals for sustainable ORR catalysis. Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist in enhancing catalytic turnover 
frequency and operational stability under realworld conditions. The intrinsic sluggish kinetics of 
ORR demands the design of catalysts with optimized active sites capable of reducing activation 
energy and facilitating efficient oxygen adsorption, activation, and bond dissociation 9. Furthermore, many catalysts experience performance degradation due to insufficient 
electrochemical and structural stability in harsh operational environments.
