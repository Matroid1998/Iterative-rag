Description:
Found in greater abundance than choline plasmalogen and used as a therapeutic agent for memory loss in amyloid-infused rats.

Plasmenyl GPLs (plasmalogen species) represent 20 of all phospholipid mass in 
humans and play central roles in many key areas such as membrane fusion, protection 
against oxidative degradation, and regulation of membranebound proteins.2 The major 
ether linked GPL species found in nature are ethanolamine plasmalogen species (PlsEtn) 
and choline plasmalogen species (PlsCho) which bear the phosphoethanolamine and 
phosphocholine head groups at the sn3 position, respectively.3 
PlsEtn are generally found in greater abundance than PlsCho and both have been 
found in human heart, brain, liver, and blood plasma in varying amounts.4 Plasmalogen 
levels have been shown to be found in greater quantities in biofluids and tissues of various 
cancer types, in particular, gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer where they have been 
correlated to oncogenic signalling.5 Patients with Alzheimers disease have been shown 
to have decreased levels of plasmalogen species compared to control subjects, where 
the most significant decrease in PlsEtn could be found in the hippocampus and frontal 
cortex.6 Recently, a study used PlsEtn as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of memory 
loss in amyloid infused rats.7 The development of streamlined techniques for the
