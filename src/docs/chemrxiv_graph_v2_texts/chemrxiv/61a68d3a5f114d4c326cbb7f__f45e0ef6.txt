Description:
Exhibits changes in electronic structure affecting H2O2 selectivity.

Text:
We show how subtle differences in 
the Ni electronic structure conferred through changes in linker identity led to significant changes 
in H2O2 selectivity, with the NiAmineMON exhibiting near 100 Faradaic efficiency (FE) 
towards H2O2. Finally, we translate the catalyst from a conventional 3electrode setup to a gas
diffusion electrode (GDE)  based reactor and attain industriallyrelevant H2O2 partial current 
densities of 200 mAcm2 while keeping an 85 FE for H2O2.
