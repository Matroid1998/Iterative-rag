Introduction
Solid fastion conductors represent a distinct class of
ionconducting materials characterized by the diffusion
of a specific type of atom through the interstitial
spaces within a solid lattice while other atoms remain
stationary in their crystal sites. This unique behavior
allows liquidlike conduction of the particular atom
within a solid framework. Notably, solid fast ion
conductors exhibit comparable ionic conduction to
liquids, particularly organic solvents, 1 such as 25
mS cm1 for Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.32, and 70 mS
cm1 for Na2(CB9H10)(CB11H12)3. Additionally,
these materials have extended operating temperature
range compared to their liquid counterparts 48,
higher energy density, longer life cycles, and enhanced
safety due to the absence of organic liquid or polymer
electrolytes 912.
