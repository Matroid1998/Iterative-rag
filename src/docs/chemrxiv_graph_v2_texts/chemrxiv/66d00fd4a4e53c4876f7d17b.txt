Description:
Hypervalent reagents used in synthetic organic chemistry as oxidants, electrophiles, radical precursors, and transmetalating agents.

Text:
Hypervalent 
iodine(III) 
reagents 
have 
experienced a renaissance in synthetic 
organic chemistry, becoming indispensable 
tools 
in 
total 
synthesis, 
latestage 
functionalisation and radiolabelling.16 Due to 
their great mechanistic flexibility, including 
reactivity as oxidants, electrophiles, radical 
precursors and transmetalating agents, they 
often enable access to chemical motifs that 
are difficult to synthesise using traditional 
approaches. However, gaps remain in the 
functionality they can transfer. Specifically, 
unstabilised 
alkyl 
groups 
are 
still 
underrepresented. For the development of 
new hypervalent iodine reagents to bridge 
this gap, it is vital to gain a fundamental 
understanding of the structural factors 
affecting their stability and reactivity.

Description:
Compounds are generally trigonal bipyramidal with the least electronegative group and two nonbonding electron pairs occupying the equatorial positions, and the most electronegative substituents forming a hypervalent 3-centre-4-electron bond in the axial position.
