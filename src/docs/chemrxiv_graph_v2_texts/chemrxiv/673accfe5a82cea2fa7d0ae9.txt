Description:
A molecule involved in catalytic conversion to methanol on Cu surfaces.

Text:
CO2 dissociation on Cu surfaces is one such model system that has received extensive
attention due to its relevance in the catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol.13 This pro
cess has been proposed as one of the strategies to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels, thereby
helping mitigate global warming.4 While extensive research has been conducted on under
standing the interaction of CO2 with Cu surfaces,5,6 a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanism and factors influencing dissociation of CO2 on Cu surfaces is still lacking.

Description:
Reported to have an activation energy of 0.96 eV for dissociation.

Text:
Similar conclusions have been reached by a more recent study8 using
near ambient Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAXPS) combined with density functional
theory (DFT) based modeling. Another study9 using similar methods (as in the work by
Nakamura and Campbell7) reported an activation energy of 0.96 eV for CO2 dissociation on
