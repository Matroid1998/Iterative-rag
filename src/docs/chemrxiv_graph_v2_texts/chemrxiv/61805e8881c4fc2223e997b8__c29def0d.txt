Description:
Referred to as SAM, it is involved in methylation processes.

sadenosylmethionine, SAM) (6, 7) and as neurotransmitters 
(e.g. adenosine) (8). Chemical analogs of nucleotides and nucleosides therefore have a wide range 
of applications, for example as substrates for artificial synthesis of DNARNA sequences with 
increased resistance to nucleases (9, 10) or reduced effect on innate immune responses (11, 12), 
inhibition of viral DNA and RNA polymerases (13, 14), inhibition of tumor cell replication (15, 
16) and treatment of autoimmune diseases (17). Nucleoside analogs are also critical in 
understanding the early evolution of life on earth under prebiotic conditions (1820) and could 
provide a means of engineering synthetic organisms with expanded genetic alphabets (21). Thus, 
exploration of molecular space of nucleoside analogs could have a huge impact on several areas 
of fundamental and translational biology.
