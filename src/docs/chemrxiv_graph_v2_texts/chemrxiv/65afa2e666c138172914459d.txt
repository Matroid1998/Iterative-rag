Description:
A solvent used in determining association constants by NMR.

Text:
of additional  interactions 
between the guest and the dendrimer have been shown to lead to increased binding. The association 
constants in chloroform solution have been determined by NMR on a modelsystem and are in the 
region 103 to 104 M1. Keywords
