Description:
Showed a positive enthalpy of mixing in a mixture with N4441N(CN)2.

Initially, they could conrm the ndings
by Navia et al.45 A mixture with two different anions
(C4mimNTf2 and C4mimPF6), however, exhitibted a
strongly positive enthalpy of mixing, which is contradicting
the ndings of Navia et al. Strong negative enthalpies of
mixing could be observed for mixtures of C4mimOAc and
C4mimC(CN)3, which were attributed to changes in the
hydrogen bonded network.43 In a subsequent study 49
they concluded that mixtures with the same cation but differ
ent anions typically show a negative enthalpy of mixing. A
recent study,51 however, is less conclusive the mixture of
C4mimOAc and P4444OAc is showing a strong negative
enthalpy of mixing, whereas mixtures of C2mimN(CN)2
and N4441N(CN)2 showed a positive enthalpy of mixing
with a maximum slightly moved to larger mole fractions of
C2mimN(CN2.
