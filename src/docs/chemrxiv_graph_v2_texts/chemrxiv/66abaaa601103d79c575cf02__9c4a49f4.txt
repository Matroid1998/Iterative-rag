Description:
Has a much lower standard reduction potential (2.37 V vs SHE) than Zn and Al metals.

Text:
With the growing demand on portable and resourcesaving energy storage systems, 
multivalentionbased batteries with potentially higher energy densities and lower cost than 
the presentday lithiumion batteries have attracted significant interest.1,2 Among these 
alternative nextgeneration batteries, rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) stand out due 
to the excellent characteristics of the Mg anode. Magnesium has a much lower standard 
reduction potential (2.37 V vs SHE) than Zn and Al metals (0.76 V and 1.66 V) and a 
volumetric capacity of 3833 mAh cm3 which is almost twice that of Ca and Li and three 
times as much as Na.

Description:
Highly abundant in the earth's crust and suspected to be less prone to dendrite formation as an anode compared to lithium.

Text:
Furthermore, magnesium is highly abundant in the earths crust (with 
2.1 around 104 times more often than lithium) and suspected to be less prone to dendrite 
formation as anode, compared to lithium.3 
To circumvent the drawbacks of liquidbased cell systems such as the passivation and 
corrosion of the Mg electrode, and ensure a lower susceptibility to dendrite formation as well 
as higher levels of safety, solidstate battery concepts are pursued.1,4,5 Here, one of the main 
challenges is to develop a solid electrolyte (SE) that has a sufficient Mgion roomtemperature
