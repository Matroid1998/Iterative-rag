Description:
A reagent used in conjunction with Mn(I) CNP pincer carbonyl precatalyst to isomerize terminal carbon-carbon double bonds.

Text:
As manganese is concerned, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one literature example described 
by Pidko and Filonenko.15 The authors utilized a cationic Mn(I) CNP pincer carbonyl precatalyst which, 
in the presence of KHBEt3, was able to isomerize terminal carbon carbon double bonds at 60 C. 
We have recently demonstrated the broad application of manganese(I) complexes based on the fac
Mn(dippe)(CO)2(CH2CH2CH3) (dippe  1,2bis(diisopropylphosphino)ethane) for hydrogenation and 
hydrofunctionalization reactions.16,17 Based on our recent findings, we describe here the activity of fac
Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3) (Mn1),17a facMn(dippe)(CO)3(H) (Mn2),18 cisMn(dippe)(CO)2(2
