Description:
Used in CO2 hydrogenation catalysts but less water tolerant than Pd-based catalysts.

Text:
For instance, transitionmetal
catalysts can enable the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol
via thermal processes.1620 Currently, CuZnOAl2O3 is the
stateoftheart catalyst for performing this reaction.21 How
ever, this catalyst experiences deactivation in the presence of
high concentrations of water within the reaction mixture.2022
Hence, developing new, watertolerant catalysts is crucial to
achieve industrial CO2 utilization. Pdbased CO2 hydrogenation catalysts are more water
tolerant than those based on Cu.
