Description:
A complex used in artificial hydroxylase for selective hydroxylation of benzylic C(sp3)H bonds.

From 
studies 
on 
ArMscatalyzed 
transformations, it appears that the welldefined 
secondary 
coordination 
sphere 
around 
the 
metallocofactor provided by the protein may be 
tailored 
to 
optimize 
the 
activity 
and 
(enantio)selectivity of the corresponding ArM.2325 
These hybrid catalysts thus combine attractive 
features of both homogeneous and enzymatic 
systems, thereby addressing some of the challenges 
typically associated with both fields. In a recent study by the Ward group, the 
selective hydroxylation of benzylic C(sp3)H bonds 
was enabled by an artificial hydroxylase.19 This ArM 
was assembled by anchoring a biotinylated 
Fe(TAML) 
complex
