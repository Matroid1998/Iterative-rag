Description:
A toxic organic solvent used in the mobile phase of RPHPLC.

Despite the numerous advantages of this separation mode, 
55 
such as a broader range of compounds and better separation efficiency, some contemporary 
56 
challenges have led to the search for new stationary phase materials to adjust the technique to the 
57 
Principles of Green Chemistry (Dembek  Bocian 2020, Dembek  Bocian 2022, Kalisz et al. 58 
2024). 59 
RPHPLC employs toxic organic solvents in the mobile phase, such as methanol, acetonitrile, and 
60 
tetrahydrofuran, resulting in a large volume of residues after the analysis. In addition, small polar 
61 
compounds are poorly retained in the nonpolar stationary phases, such as C8 and C18, making their 
62 
separation and, consequently, their determination difficult in various samples (Poole 2019, Jandera 
63 
 Hajek 2020).
