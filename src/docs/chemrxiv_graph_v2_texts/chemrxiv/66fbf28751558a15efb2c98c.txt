Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode in fuel cell technologies.

Text:
The widespread commercialization of low temperature fuel cell technologies depends on the 
stack production and materials costs, to which the cathode catalyst contributes up to 40.1 
Cheaper catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode are either obtained by a 
reduction of the platinum content with ultralow loading platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts2, 
or by eliminating the PGM costs with platinum group metal free (PGMfree) catalysts.3 The 
activity of FeNC catalysts, the best performing representative of latter catalyst class, improved 
tremendously in both acidic and alkaline pH environment.4,5 Despite the progress, the 
volumetric activity of less bulk dense FeNC catalysts is still significantly inferior to that of 
commercial PtC catalysts due to the low active site density of FeNC catalysts.6 Consequently, 
high loadings of FeNC catalysts are applied compared to PtC cathodes.
