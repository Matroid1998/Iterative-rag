Compounds that have been extensively investigated for different types of batteries.

New materials, 
including electroactive porous organic polymers, and novel 
redoxactive moieties beyond the wellknown organic radicals, 
carbonyl, and organosulfur compounds have been extensively 
investigated for different types of batteries in recent years.9 In 
addition, sophisticated operando and exsitu characterisation 
techniques19,20 have been developed to further investigate 
charge storage mechanisms in organic compounds, whereas 
machine 
learning 
methods 
are 
also 
accelerating 
the 
identification and discovery of promising organic electrodes.21 
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline 
porous polymers composed of organic building blocks linked by 
strong covalent bonds.
