Description:
Coordinating atoms in complexes that favor Li over Na or K.

Text:
While this 
observation follows intuition, we identified unique complexes which deviate from this trend and 
hold significant promise for distinctive forms of selectivity in materials, namely those with planar 
coordinating atoms that could preferentially bind K and Li over Na, compounds with large ring 
sizes despite small coordination numbers that would disfavor Li binding in comparison to Na or 
K, and complexes with N coordinating atoms which favor Li over Na or K. Additionally, we 
showed that the majority of the differential binding energy originates from chemical interaction 
rather than molecular reorganization. Our trained ML models revealed that both electronic and 
geometric features play critical roles in predicting the differential binding energy, and neither 
category strongly dominates the prediction.
