Data from Johns Hopkins University updated that Coronavirus Disease2019 (COVID19) has
infected more than four million people, which has become a rare pandemic in human
history(httpswww.jhu.edu). In the early stage of the outbreak, diagnostic methods and virus
traceability are the research focus. With the development of the disease, COVID19 is likely to
become a kind of infectious disease coexisting with human beings. Vaccine development, drug
screening and related pharmacology will gradually become the research hot areas. In China, through thousands of years clinical application, herbal medicine has accumulated
