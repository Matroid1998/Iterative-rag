A mineral phase formed from large molecular clusters.

The diverse chemistry of the earth abundant Fe ion remains at the forefront of a variety of 
transformative scientific disciplines, including biochemistry,1 catalysis,2 porous materials,3 
nanoparticles,4 batteries,5 superconductivity,6 thermoelectrics,7 spintronics,8 and magnetism.9 In the 
latter area Fe remains ubiquitous in both solidstate10 and moleculebased chemistry.11,12 
The recent discoveries of three molecular iron oxide compounds, Fe13,13,14 Fe17,15 and Fe34,16 with 
structures related to the minerals ferrihydrite and magnetite, suggests that several other very large, 
high symmetry, molecular clusters exist en route to the formation of 3D oxide or oxyhydroxide mineral 
phases. In turn, this hints that (large) lacunary or diminished molecular oxyhydroxide FeO(OH) 
clusters not conforming to mineral structure types, including heterometallic species, must also exist.
