Description:
Polymers of increasing importance due to their potential for chemical recycling and biodegradability.

1 B),27 although this 
can potentially provide access to new types of polymeric materials and can be also used to tune the chemophysical 
properties of the material. Polyesters are of increasing importance as they can function as substitutes for other bulk  and commodity polymers, 
due to their high potential with respect to chemical recycling and biodegradability, but methodologies to achieve their 
recycling, degradation and valorization, as well as the optimization of their properties, still require significant improvement.
