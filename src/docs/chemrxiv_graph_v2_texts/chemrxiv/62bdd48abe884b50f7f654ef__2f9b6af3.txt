Description:
Used as a substrate for studying the interaction with BMPTFSI and Li0.

Text:
Despite of numerous model studies on the formation of the
SEI812 and in particular of BMPTFSI1318 in the past few
years, neither the actual composition of the SEI nor the mech
anisms of its formation are fully clear yet, in particular not
on a molecular scale. Different decomposition products have
been deduced from xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
experiments studying the interaction of Li0 with a BMPTFSI
monolayer on graphite15 and from XPS experiments studying
the interaction of Li0 with BMPTFSI mono or multilayers
on various oxide surfaces (Co3O4, CoO).17,18 XP measure
ments on the interaction of the IL monolayer with graphite
a)Electronic mail axel.grossuniulm.de
(HOPG) suggest, that decomposition mainly affects the an
ion, as the N 1s peak of TFSI declines.
