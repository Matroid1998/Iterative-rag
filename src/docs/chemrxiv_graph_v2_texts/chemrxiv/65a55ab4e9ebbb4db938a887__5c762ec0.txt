Description:
An inorganic compound found in the inner layer of the solid electrolyte interphase in lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a thin passivating layer formed at the anodeelectrolyte 
interface in lithiumion batteries as a result of the decomposition of the electrolyte by electrons 
from the anode14. Experimental studies were able to identify a multilayered structure with an 
inorganic inner layer near the electrodeSEI interface (Li2CO3, LiF, and Li2O), and an organic 
outer layer near the SEIelectrolyte interface consisting of alkyl carbonate, polymers, etc.15. However, due to the limitation of the experimental techniques, it is challenging to investigate 
other properties of the SEI like thermodynamics and kinetics of it its formation and growth1
3,5,6. Computational models have emerged to better understand the SEI formation and growth.
