Description:
Starting material for synthesizing acyl carbazoles through metal-catalyzed CX amidations and ring closure.

Text:
NAcyl carbazoles are effective fluorophors, previously shown to exhibit strong organic 
phosphorescence when mixed with specific additives.15 Other carbazole units are 
found in drugs, natural products. They are also used in electrochemistry and as 
reagents in transamidation reactions.612 The traditional method to produce this 
versatile Nacyl carbazole motif involves combining 9Hcarbazoles with acyl chlorides 
or similar activated acyl derivatives in the presence of a base (Scheme 1  a).13, 14 
As an alternative, acyl carbazoles can be synthesized through stepwise metal
catalyzed CXamidations followed by a ringclosure starting from 2,2diiodo1,1
biphenyls.1517 Related onepot procedures are also described (Scheme 1  b).18
