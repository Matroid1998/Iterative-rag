Description:
Influences dopamine receptors, although research on this is limited.

Text:
Dopamine is known to
have a total of 5 receptors which are divided into two main functional categories. Although a great deal of research has been conducted on the effect of THC on dopamine, the amount of research
conducted on the influence of THC on dopamine receptors is limited. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the
relationship between THC and D1 receptors. CB1 Receptors
The CB1 receptor is known to be part of the endocannabinoid system, which modulates activity in the brain,
endocrine system, immune cells, and other parts of the body. Additionally, it is involved in stress responses and
reproductive functions. The CB1 receptor is known to be a G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR), a type of receptor
