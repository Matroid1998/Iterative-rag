In the arsenal of organic chemists, transition metal
catalyzed crosscoupling of unactivated alkyl halides with 
organometallic reagents remains one of the most straightforward 
and modular approaches to the connection of sp3hybridized 
carbons.36 Tremendous progress has been made in this area 
through the use of palladium,710 and, more recently, nickel 
catalysts.1115 

On the other hand, copper catalysts represent appealing 
alternatives to their palladium and nickel counterparts.1624 As 
copper is one of the most abundant transition metals in Earths 
crust, it is much less expensive and more globally available than 
Pd and Ni e.g., Cu(OAc)2  1g, Ni(OAc)2 ca. 10g, and 
Pd(OAc)2 ca.
