It is worth noting that the toxicity of HMIs has a more 
significant impact on children than on adults. Children are more susceptible to organ 
damage and neurotoxicity, which may cause behavioral disorders, learning problems, and 
impaired growth in childrens development. 1014 Therefore, it is crucial to continuously 
monitor HMIs in the environment to prevent or reduce the potential harm they may cause. The Environmental Quality Standards Directive List has identified several heavy metals 
as prime substances of concern in water quality, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), 
copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn). 1216 Although these elements are essential to life in trace quantities, they are hazardous 
to human health at higher concentrations.
