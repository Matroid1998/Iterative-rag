Description:
Forms complexes with 201Tl(III) for radiochemical applications but rapidly decays in human blood.

Text:
The authors oxidized the readily available 201Tl(I) by treatment 
with hydrochloric acid and ozone and found good radiochemical yields and purity for the 
formation of DOTA and DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) 201TlTl(III)labelled 
complexes. Unfortunately, the DTPA compound was found to rapidly decay in human blood
