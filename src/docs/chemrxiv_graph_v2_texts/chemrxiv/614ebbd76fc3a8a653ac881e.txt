Description:
A material used in resistive pulse sensing sensors.

Text:
Increasingly known as resistive 
pulse sensing sensors (RPS), devices based on this principle have now been created 
from a range of materials from graphene,13 to polymers,4,5 silicon nitride6 and glass.7
11 The sensing process is simple, by monitoring the temporary changes in current 
caused by the translocation of an analyte through a narrow constriction, termed a 
sensing region or pore, RPS can characterise analytes according to size,12 
concentration,13 shape1417 and charge.18 The transport of an analyte through the pore 
is controlled by tuning the applied electric field, charge on the pore wall, electrophoretic 
mobility of the analyte, supporting electrolyte concentration and induced 
convection.19,20 To maintain sensitivity the pore size must be of comparable 
dimensions as the analyte.5 Therefore, whilst a smaller sensing region can detect 
smaller analytes, the drawback is an increases the likelihood of blockages, and a 
decreased translocation frequency.
