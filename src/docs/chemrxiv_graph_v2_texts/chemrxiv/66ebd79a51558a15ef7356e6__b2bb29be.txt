Description:
A component in colloidal nanoparticles used for selforganization into functional materials.

Text:
The selforganization of colloidal nanoparticles (gold, silica, polystyrene) into intricate andor 
periodical structure is a crucial area in colloidal sciences due to their potential to make new 
functional material.1,2 Selfassemblies can be broadly classified into equilibrium and outof
equilibrium types. Equilibrium assemblies form thermodynamically stable, highly periodic 
structures that can be used in functional materials like colloidal photonic crystals,3,4 metamaterials5
7 exhibiting high (n  3) or negative refractive indices,814 and optoelectronic metamaterials based 
on quantum dot superlattices showing superfluorescence.15,16 On the other hand, outof
equilibrium, or active, selfassemblies respond dynamically to external stimuli (chemical, 
electrical, optical, magnetic) and offer the advantage of being reconfigurable. In both types of 
colloidal selfassembly, understanding the interactions between individual components is essential 
for controlling their spatial arrangement and engineering these materials.
