Description:
A chiral building block used in asymmetric synthetic methodologies.

Text:
The epoxide, (R)1,2epoxyhex5ene (1) is an important chiral building block. It has been 
used in a number of asymmetric synthetic methodologies, including the syntheses of chiral 
isothiazolidine1,1dioxides,1 
benzoxathiazepine1,1dioxides,2 
butanolides,3 
hydroxy 
morpholine amides,4 and varied alcohols. Several natural product syntheses have also utilized 
compound 1, such as in the syntheses of ()gigantecin and ()14deoxy9oxygigantecin,5 
pyragonicin,6 amphidinolides C and F,7,8 and Sch725674 macrolactones.9 Biologically active 
compounds and pharmaceutical substances have also been prepared as single enantiomers from 
this chiral epoxide.

Description:
A chiral compound that reacts with catalytic lithium 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidide to insert into an olefin group.

Text:
For example, compound 1 is used in the synthesis of the C20C26 fragment of 
the anticancer drug  Halaven.10,11 A kgscale synthesis of the bicyclic ketone, (1R,5S)
bicyclo3.1.0hexan2one (3), has been reported and this synthetic method begins with the chiral 
epoxide 1 (Scheme 1).12 In this transformation, the chiral epoxide is reacted with catalytic lithium 
2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidide (TMP) which allows insertion into the olefin group to provide the
