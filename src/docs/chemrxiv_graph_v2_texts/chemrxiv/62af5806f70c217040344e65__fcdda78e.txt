Description:
A dopant used in Li7La3Zr2O12 to modify its properties.

The mechanism of lithiummetal penetration into solidstate electrolytes has been an 
important topic of scientific research since the seminal work of Monroe and Newman4. They 
predicted that solidstate electrolytes with a shear modulus 8 GPa would suppress lithium metal 
intrusion due to the dependence of the electrochemical potential of lithium on stress4. However, 
one of the most studied oxide solid electrolytes, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO, which is usually doped 
with Al, Ta, or Ga), has a shear modulus of 60 GPa5,6 but still exhibits intrusion growth at 
current densities well below 1 mA cm2 (averaged across the electrode)2,7, which is even lower 
than the threshold current density for liquid electrolytes. Recent theoretical studies resolve this
