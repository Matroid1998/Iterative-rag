Description:
A dynamically developing group of synthetic aliphatic biodegradable polymers.

Over the last few decades, there has been rapid progress in research on the use of polymeric materials in 
biomedical applications. Numerous scientific reports highlight the potential of using such materials to support 
the functioning, regeneration, or treatment of tissues in the cardiovascular, nervous, musculoskeletal, or 
integumentary systems 1,2. In particular, biodegradable polymers have attracted increasing attention for their 
ability to temporarily support these processes and subsequently be eliminated from the body through natural 
metabolic pathways 3. Among biodegradable polymers, a very dynamically developing group are synthetic 
aliphatic polyesters. The most prominent examples include thermoplastic polylactide (PLA) 4, 
polycaprolactone (PCL) 5, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) 6, poly(lactidecoglycolide) (PLGA) 7, as well 
as elastomeric poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) 8 or poly(glycerol adipate) (PGA) 9.
