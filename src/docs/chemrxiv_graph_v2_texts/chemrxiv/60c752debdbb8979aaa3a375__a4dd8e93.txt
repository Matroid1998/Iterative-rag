Description:
An intermediate that can polymerize on surfaces to form polyacene through Diels-Alder cycloaddition followed by dehydrogenation.

1a), while 
the vicinal dimethyl groups could lead to an orthoquinodimethane (named as tail, Fig. 1a), therefore 
forming intermediate i1. We expected that this intermediate could polymerize on surface to obtain pol
yacene by means of DielsAlder cycloaddition (headtotail polymerization) followed by dehydrogena
tion.
