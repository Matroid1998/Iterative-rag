Description:
A structural analogue used in azobenzene-based PSTs for reversibly switchable tubulin polymerisation inhibition.

Developing 
spatiotemporallytargetable 
small molecule MT inhibitors has thus been an important 
goal, and optical control strategies have been prioritised 
since light can be applied with high spatiotemporal 
precision even in vivo.10,11 Irreversibly phototriggered 
strategies 
were 
initially 
developed, 
including 
photobleachable and photouncageable inhibitors, or 
using 
practically 
irreversible

double 
bond 
photoisomerisation.1217 However, irreversibly triggered 
approaches cannot overcome the diffusion of the active 
drug over time, so they suffer conceptually from limited 
spatiotemporal resolution. Spatially and temporally patterning bioactivity 
instead demands switching in situ in live cells, over many 
offon cycles. Azobenzenebased PSTs that are 
structural analogues of combretastatin A4 are the best
developed platform for reversibly switchable tubulin 
polymerisation inhibitors. PSTs can be reversibly
