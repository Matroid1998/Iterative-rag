Description:
Used as an adsorbent in adsorption processes for water treatment.

1.0 Background
Groundnut shell and sorghum husk are cheap and aboundant agricultural material which 
can be used for water treatment for the removal of various pollutants in water. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon by which solids holds the molecules of liquid or gas 
as a thin flm through the process of mass transfer. Adsorption phenomena are operative 
in most physical, chemical and biological system by using a solid (e.g activated carbon, 
sorghum husk, groundnut shell etc.) as the adsorbent. The process of adsorption can easily be studied using graphs. This is known as adsoption 
Isotherm. Adsorption isotherm provides information on the interactions of the molecules 
with the surface of the adsorbent.
