Description:
Involved in direct air capture and capture from flue gas.

For example, SCUTC19 undergoes 55 BET surface area loss after prolonged exposure 
to humid air, indicating a dramatic decrease in porosity.10 Such decomposition is often attributed 
to the disruption of the metallinker bond, which is normally the weakest point of the MOF 
structure,1113 resulting in linker release through either a hydrolysis or linker displacement 
mechanism.14 However, various applications of MOFs demand water stability.15, 16 For example, 
any MOF intended for use that entails exposure to ambient air or industrial gas streams should be 
able to tolerate humidity. Such applications include water harvesting from air,14, 1721 direct air 
capture of CO2 and O2,2227 CO2 capture from flue gas,28 and pollutant sensing in air.29 In addition, 
for some applications, a MOF must be stable even in liquid water.
