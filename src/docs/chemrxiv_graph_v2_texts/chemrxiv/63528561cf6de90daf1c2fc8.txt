Description:
Organic compounds containing a sulfhydryl group, often used as bridging ligands in complexes.

Text:
Two types of complexes can be distinguished, mixed (at least one of the bridge thiols 
is different, A in Figure 1) and symmetric (the three bridge thiols are identical, B and C in 
Figure 1)27. Former studies of this type of compounds on Toxoplasma gondii28, Neospora 
caninum29 and Trypanosoma brucei30 identified high antiparasitic activity for some derivatives. For 
example, compounds AC (Figure 1) inhibit T. gondii tachyzoites proliferation with IC50 values in 
nanomolar range (down to 1.2 nM for A) while not affecting the HFF (human foreskins fibroblasts) host 
cells viability.
