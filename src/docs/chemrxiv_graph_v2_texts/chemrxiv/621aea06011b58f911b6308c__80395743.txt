Description:
Nonaromatic compounds that displayed intrinsic luminescence.

Text:
This emission mechanism is 
rationalized by the clusterizationtriggered emission (CTE) mechanism.16 Clusteroluminogen 
is used to describe these special luminophores (CLgens). CLgens have gradually drawn many 
researchers attention as they are not considered to be typical luminescent materials.17 
Recent studies have revealed that many natural biomolecules such as bovine serum albumin 
(BSA),18 polypeptide,19 nonaromatic amino acids displayed intrinsic luminescence,20, 21 which 
are categorized into CLgens. Inspired by these natural biopolymers, many synthetic polymeric 
CLgens including poly(maleic anhydridealtvinyl acetate),22 poly(taconic anhydridecovinyl
