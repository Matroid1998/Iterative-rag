Description:
Deficient at the surface of the crystal compared to the bulk.

Text:
The CaP molar ratio at the 
surface is lower than that of the bulk crystal and, thus, rather calcium deficient.11 A factor accounting for 
the lower CaP value is the presence of HPO42 at the surface,2, 5, 12, 13 which is the most abundant phosphate 
species in a nearneutral medium. Since the form of the lattice ion (PO43) differs from its corresponding 
species in the solution (HPO42), the chemical composition of the surface layer, under the impact of the 
solution, differs from the bulk. Given the large specific surface area of a nanoparticle, the amount of the 
entity in the surface layer is comparable to that of the bulk crystal.
