Description:
Used in state-of-the-art transistors and silicon-based circuitry, but can fail due to quantum tunneling at small sizes.

Text:
Stateoftheart transistors rely on
gated siliconbased circuitry which, when reduced to sufficiently
small sizes, fail to prevent electrons from transporting across the
gate via quantum tunneling effectively rendering the transistor
useless.10 While this has not slowed research into the develop
ment of smaller and smaller silicon chips, molecular electronics
provides an attractive alternative.11,12 For one, devices designed
with organic molecules exist, by their very nature, at the atomic
scale allowing researchers to build from the ground up rather
than scale current technology down. Secondly, the exact control
