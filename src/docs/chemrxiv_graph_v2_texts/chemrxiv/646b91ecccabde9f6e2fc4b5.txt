Description:
A solvent used to dissolve compounds for determining kinetic solubility.

Low solubility can result in inaccurate highthroughput screening
(HTS) outcomes and can mask toxicity effects during earlystage drug development.1,2 The intrinsic
solubility of a compound refers to its solubility in a neutral state at thermodynamic equilibrium
between the solid and dissolved state.3 Although several modeling approaches have been developed
to predict intrinsic solubility, usually small sets of compounds were used since acquiring such
experimental data is timeconsuming and costly, requiring the achievement of thermodynamic
equilibrium and titration to obtain the pH at which the compound is neutral.4 A cheaper approach
involves the determination of kinetic solubility, whereby compounds are first dissolved in DMSO and
then added to water to determine precipitation concentration.5 The kinetic solubility of compounds is
frequently higher than intrinsic solubility due to supersaturation and strongly assay dependent.6 An
even faster approach, as used in this study, is to determine threshold solubility, which is crucial in
assessing whether a given compound is soluble enough for an HTS screening assay.7
Although experimental methods can determine solubility, they are often timeconsuming and require a
considerable amount of resources.
