Description:
Nanocrystals whose size depends on flow rate and morphology transitions with temperature.

To obtain ideal
precursors for this synthesis and to serve as a material baseline, we initially developed a novel hotinjection
batch synthesis, which can be performed under ambient conditions. Based on this approach, we investigated a
series of different preparation methods for synthesizing Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals under continuous flow conditions. After establishing a reliable and reproducible synthesis protocol, we systematically investigated the influence
of the flow rate and the reaction temperature on the optical properties and morphology of the C3Cu2I5 NCs. The volumetric screenings reveal a direct dependence of the nanocrystal size on the flow rate and a transition
in morphology from spherical particles to nanorods with increasing reaction temperature.
