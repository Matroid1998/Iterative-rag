Description:
Undergoes ring hydrolysis when conjugated to cysteine in ADCs.

Text:
The released payload 
components from ADC are subject to small molecule 
metabolism by enzymes in the liver such as CYP450s.3 Another 
scenario is when linkerpayload is still conjugated to the 
antibody, but has been modified. Typically, conjugated linker
payload remain quite stable in circulation because ADCs reside 
in the extracellular environment and have limited exposure to 
metabolizing enzymes. However, biotransformation can still 
occur on the linkerpayload. One reported example is 
maleimide ring hydrolysis commonly observed on cysteine 
conjugated ADCs.

Description:
Undergoes hydrolysis to prevent nonspecific deconjugation.

Text:
Once maleimide is hydrolyzed, the linker
payload is no longer subject to elimination through retro
Michael 
reaction 
and 
thus 
prevents 
nonspecific 
deconjugation.4,5 Another reported biotransformation is 
hydrolysis on the payload structure.6 Other observed changes to 
linkerpayload are cleavages or partial loss, such as hydrazone 
cleavage, peptide bond cleavage, carbamate cleavage, and 
disulfide cleavage, etc.3 In summary, the biotransformation of 
conjugated payload is very different from released payload or 
small molecules. Assessing biotransformation of conjugated payload is 
important for evaluating efficacy because the payload 
component may be still active depending on the change.7 
Overall, ADC biotransformation information is valuable for 
understanding in vivo stability and pharmacokinetics for 
guiding drug design. Traditional 
bioanalysis 
supporting 
pharmacokinetic 
assessments involves monitoring surrogate analytes (peptides 
or payload) via targeted bottomup based approach.
