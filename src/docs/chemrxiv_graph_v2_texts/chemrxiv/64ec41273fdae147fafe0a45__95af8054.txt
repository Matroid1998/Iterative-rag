Description:
A cation with a calculated effective energy barrier to relaxation of magnetization (Ueff) value above 1000 cm-1.

Text:
The isolation of the decamethyldysprosocenium cation, Dy(Cp)2 (Cp  
C5Me5), has therefore long been a desirable target for the SMM community.17,18 The 
effective energy barrier to relaxation of magnetization (Ueff) value of the hypothetical 
Dy(Cp)2 cation was calculated to be above 1000 cm1 by Gao and coworkers in 2016.18 
Recent work by Reta et al. concluded that although the linearity of the Dy(Cp)2 cation and 
therefore its Ueff value would be reduced compared to the Dy(C5iPr5)(Cp) cation,8 the 
vibrational modes may be shifted offresonance with electronic states that could lead to 
comparatively slower relaxation rates.17 However, it has been shown that the relatively small 
steric bulk of the Cp ligand (cf.

Description:
A cation that cannot be isolated due to insufficient blocking of equatorial ligand interactions.

Text:
C5iPr5 and Cpttt, C5H2tBu31,2,4) is not sufficient to block 
equatorial ligand interactions and allow the isolation of the Dy(Cp)2 cation, even with weak
