Description:
A semiconductor material important for optoelectronic applications.

Text:
IIInitrides (AlN, GaN, and InN) and their alloys are prominent semiconductor materials. AlN and GaN are highly important for optoelectronic applications and form the backbone in 
modern light emitting diode technology. The revised band gap of InN to 0.7 eV 1 and its high 
electron mobility2,3 open up new opportunities; such as IR emitters, sensors4, solar cells,5 thin
film transistors6, and highelectron mobility transistors7. As all such applications are based on 
heterostructures with homogeneous coverage of nanoscale active layers, highly controlled InN 
epitaxy is paramount to realize any application.
