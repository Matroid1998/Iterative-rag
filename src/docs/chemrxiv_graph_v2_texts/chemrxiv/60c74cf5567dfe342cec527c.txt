Description:
Present in nitrogen-containing heteroaryl halides, affecting reaction conditions.

Text:
Nicatalyzed crosselectrophile coupling (CEC) reactions to generate new C(sp2)C(sp3) 
bonds have received significant attention over the last decade due to the prevalence of these 
linkages in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and the limitations of current synthetic methods 
to form these bonds (Figure 1a).1 Despite the widespread interest, reaction development has relied 
heavily on the empirical screening of reaction parameters, such as the identity of the ancillary 
ligand and presence of pyridine and alkali halide additives.2 Consequently, reaction conditions 
developed using this strategy are often specific to a limited range of substrates.3 For example, 
typical reaction conditions for the coupling of aryl halides with primary alkyl bromides, primary 
alkyl iodides, or primary benzyl chlorides utilize different ligand sets, additives, solvents, and 
reductants.1a,1b,2,4 Further, even within a particular substrate class, for instance nitrogen
containing heteroaryl halides, significant changes are often required depending on the exact 
identity of the substrates.5 Unfortunately, it is often unclear why a given alteration of reaction 
conditions or the presence of an additive results in the desired reactivity, which complicates the 
translation of the method to other substrates.
