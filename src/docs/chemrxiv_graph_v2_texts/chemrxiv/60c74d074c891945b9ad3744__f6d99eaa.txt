Description:
A small molecule used as a nonfullerene acceptor in organic solar cells.

For 
instance, it was suggested that, the offset larger than 0.3 eV is imperative between the 
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of acceptor with highest occupied molecular 
orbital (HOMO) level of donor, and thus leads to major loss in opencircuit voltage (VOC).16 
However, recent studies based on nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells 
(OSC) have shown that excitons can be decoupled with a negligible energy offsets as low as 
0.050.2 eV, and thus, small VOC loss is achieved.17,18 For example, NFA based OSCs 
comprising P3TEA as donor and a small molecule, SFPDI2 as nonfullerene acceptor with a 
PCE of 9.5 exhibited only 0.05 eV energy offset and 0.61 eV energy loss.17 This has led to 
remarkable improvement in overall PCE of OSCs, albeit, still lower than the ShockleyQueisser
