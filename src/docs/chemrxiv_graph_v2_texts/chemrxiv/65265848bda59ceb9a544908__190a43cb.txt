Description:
Its OSC and oxidation kinetics improve with larger R3 cations or through aliovalent doping.

Text:
Such applications require materials with a 
high reversible oxygen storage capacity (OSC), fast bulk ion transport and oxygen surface exchange rates.22
24 However, the oxidation kinetics of these materials are generally slow, with time to full oxidation on the scale 
of several hours.25 This implies a smaller available OSC when using short dwell times or fast heating and 
cooling rates,20,2530 which are both necessary for efficient O2 gas production by cyclic processes like CLAS.23 
Both the OSC and oxidation kinetics of RMnO3 are known to improve with larger R3 cations, either as the 
sole Rsite cation or as a substituted element in YMnO3,19,25,26,2833 or through aliovalent doping, e.g.
