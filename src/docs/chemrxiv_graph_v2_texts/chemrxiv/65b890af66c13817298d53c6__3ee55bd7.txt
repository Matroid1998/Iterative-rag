Description:
Produce ketene emissions under real-world vaping conditions.

Text:
Recently, we reported 
that four acetylated cannabinoids (acetylated 8 and 9 THC, CBN, and CBD; Figure 1), 
produce ketene emissions under realworld vaping conditions, from either a vape pen or dab 
platform, including at levels in range of NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety  
Health) thresholds.7 Interestingly, aerosolized THC products had been reported to cause acute 
respiratory syndromes prior to the EVALI outbreak.11
