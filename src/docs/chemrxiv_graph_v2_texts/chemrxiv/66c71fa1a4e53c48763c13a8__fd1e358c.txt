Description:
Can exist in the supercritical or dense phase region depending on pressure and temperature conditions.

Pressurisation via
gas compression is a straightforward choice. Provided suf
ficient compression stages with applied intercooling, the
pressure eventually reaches the desired value for trans
port above the critical point. Depending on the available
cooling utility and the achievable temperature, this will
either result in CO2 in the supercritical or dense phase
region. Another option for pressurisation is gas compres
sion to a pressure below the critical pressure, followed by

pressure is reached (in the dense phase region). A variant
of this is gas compression to a pressure above the critical
point, yet below the final pressure, followed by cooling
below the critical temperature and dense phase pump
ing to the final pressure.
