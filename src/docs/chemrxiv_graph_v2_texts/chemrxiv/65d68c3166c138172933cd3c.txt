Description:
Emissions are lower in chemically recycled monomers from pyrolysis compared to the production of virgin plastic.

However, chemical recycling often faces a significant drawback in the form of high 
energy consumption, especially in processes like pyrolysis, which demand temperatures in the range of 300 
to 500 C.11 Pyrolysis is able to recover mixed plastic waste by applying heat under an inert atmosphere, 
resulting in the production of monomers, gases, oils, and char.11 In some cases, e.g. for LDPE, using 
chemically recycled monomers from pyrolysis for renewed plastic production was found to be less energy 
consuming and lower in CO2 emissions than the production of virgin plastic.12 This makes chemical 
processing a valuable alternative to landfill or incineration for otherwise difficult to recycle plastic waste. While chemical recycling may produce a variety of products including monomers, upcycling typically 
involves creating highervalue products.
