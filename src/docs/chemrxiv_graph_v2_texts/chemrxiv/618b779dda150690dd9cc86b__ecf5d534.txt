Description:
Compounds that have been reported to interact with f orbitals in intermetallics and metal salts.

Text:
In contrast, the reports in which the f orbital itself interacts with the orbitals of other atoms 
(sf, pf, df interaction) have been reported for intermetallics, metal oxides, and metal salts, and 
superconducting behavior was demonstrated in the 1980s.6 Recently, Kuga et al. determined the 
exact model of hybridization among Yb 4f and B 2p on YbAlB4.6a
