Description:
Compounds with unique behavior due to the small size of the boron atom and absence of p-electrons.

IIIV compound semiconductors provide the material basis for a number of wellestablished 
technologies and new classes of advanced hightemperature, highpower and highfrequency 
electronicoptoelectronic devices such as highelectronmobility heterostructures, lightemitting 
diodes, diode lasers, electrooptic modulators, photodetectors, frequencymixing modules, etc. 1. Among the AIIIBV semiconductors, boron monopnictides are interesting because of their unique 
behavior due to the small size of the boron atom and the absence of pelectrons. The most studied 
compounds in this group are boron nitride (BN) and boron phosphide (BP). Boron arsenide (BAs) is 
much less studied experimentally (see recent review 2 and references therein), while BSb and BBi 
have not yet been synthesized, and have been studied only by theoretical methods 37.
