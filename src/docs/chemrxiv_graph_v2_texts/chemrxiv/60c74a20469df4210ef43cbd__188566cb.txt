Description:
Acts as a ligand in nickel complexes and is a 1,4-michael acceptor.

Text:
6 Here, we show that nickel
complexes, bearing pyrocathecol violet (PCV) as a ligand, can be easily formed in buered conditions. 7
These blue nickel complexes can be scrutinized using a socalled Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) 8
to recognize phosphate or thiols containing molecules such as pyrophosphate (PP) or GSHCys. The PCV
ligand forming the Nicomplex is also a 1,4michael acceptor, therefore a competition with an indicator
displacement assay and a 1,4  michael addition (1,4MA) for recognition may take place. We show that, for
both cysteine and Lreduced GSH, the 1,4MA is surprisingly preferred to the IDA, suggesting that thiol
containing molecules are more likely to engage a 1,4MA than a ligand exchange, even in presence of a
metal.

Description:
A compound used in forming a blue-colored complex with nickel sulfate.

When in presence of PP, the indicator displacement assay is preferred though. The onecomplex

Materials and methods
Dissolving pyrocathecol violet (PCV, 250 M) and nickel sulfate (250 M) in 24(2hydroxyethyl)1piperazinylethanesulfo
acid (HEPES, 100 mM, pH7.4) formed Ni(PCV), which is blue colored at working micromolar concentra
tions (Figure 1). By analogy with other reported dinuclear complexe 10 8 , we hypothesized that the
Ni(PCV) complex could be used to assemble a receptor for phosphate derivatives, exploiting metalligand
interactions for selective target recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this mononuclear complex has
