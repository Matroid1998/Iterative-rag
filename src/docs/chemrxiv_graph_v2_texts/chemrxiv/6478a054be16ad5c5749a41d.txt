Description:
Forms carbon-centered radicals that add to CC bonds in radical cyclizations, leading to cyclic products.

Radical cyclizations are a powerful strategy to forge CC 
bonds. These intramolecular processes benefit from 
very rapid kinetics, can generate multiple bonds in one 
transformation, and enable unique reactivity pathways 
for the synthesis of complex scaffolds.13 Although radi
cal processes have traditionally relied on harmful rea
gents and harsh conditions, photoredox catalysis has 
emerged as a method of choice for performing radical 
chemistry under mild, nontoxic conditions.45 Radical 
cyclizations typically involve the addition of a carbon
centered radical to a CC  bond, leading to cyclic prod
ucts (Scheme 1a).2, 6 This strategy has been widely em
ployed to produce both saturated and unsaturated all
carbon rings and heterocycles.1, 3, 7 Stereoselective radi
cal cyclizations, moreover, have been used to access 
enantioenriched cyclic frameworks, which feature e.g.
