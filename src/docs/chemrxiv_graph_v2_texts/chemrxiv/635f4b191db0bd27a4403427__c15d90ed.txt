Description:
A compound developed with multiple functions based on structure-activity relationship analyses.

Such single targetbased therapeutics can 
temporarily relieve symptoms,3,19 and their efficacies are still questionable, however.9,26 Thus, 
significant endeavors in designing chemical reagents capable of targeting and modulating two or 
more pathogenic elements have been made to elucidate the complex pathology of AD and 
discover effective therapeutic candidates.3,9 Herein, we illustrate rational approaches for 
developing flavonoids that can target multiple pathogenic factors, including free radicals, AChE, 
metalfree Ab, and metalAb, as depicted in Fig. 1a, and modulate their reactivities. We identified 
key structural features shown in flavonoids that are responsible for versatile reactivities against 
desired pathological targets through structureactivity relationship studies. Moreover, the most 
promising flavonoid with multiple functions was developed based on our structureactivity 
relationship analyses, with the determination of molecularlevel mechanistic details.
