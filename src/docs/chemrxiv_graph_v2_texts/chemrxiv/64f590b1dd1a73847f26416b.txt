Description:
Elements used in generating single-molecule magnets (SMMs).

Text:
The smaller size and tailorable magnetic property make SMMs useful for high density
storage devices.1,2 As the spin state of an SMM could be manipulable, molecular spintronics
devices can use SMMs.3 SMMs can be incorporated into molecular switches, green magnetic
cooling systems, sensors and in quantum computing.47 The first SMM was discovered for
a transition metal complex consists of Mn12.8 Recently SMMs are mostly generated from
lanthanides and actinides.911 However, very recently, the affair of LISCO in combinational
with SMM of transition metal complexes is drawing attention of the researcher because of
its various potential applications.12
