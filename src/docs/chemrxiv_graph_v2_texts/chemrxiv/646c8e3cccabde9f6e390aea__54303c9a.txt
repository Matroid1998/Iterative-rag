it comes as no 
surprise that it is commonly found in wastewaters.3,1013 Incomplete removal of TCS by 
wastewater treatment facilities results in a significant discharge into the environment In a 
global survey by the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt), triclosan was listed 
among the 20 PPCP contaminants that were most frequently detected in surface water, 
groundwater, or drinking water.14 In the European Union, it has recently been proposed to add 
triclosan to a list of priority water pollutants requiring more stringent control measures (EU 
legislative procedure 20220344COD). A number of possible effects contribute to the environmental hazard potential of TCS.
