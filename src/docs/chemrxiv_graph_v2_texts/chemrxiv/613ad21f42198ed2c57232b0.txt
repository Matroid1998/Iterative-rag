strate that uorination is a practical route to induce half
metallicity in zigzag boron nitride nanoribbon26. Simi
larly, the passivation of hydrogen and uorine on the hBN
monolayer changes the electronic and magnetic properties
drastically27. The structural and electronic properties of
graphene supported on FBNF monolayer substrate modies
the electronic properties of graphene supporting the fabrica
tion of highperformance graphenebased nanodevices28. Additionally, the controlled adsorption of uorine atoms
on both sides of a pristine hBN sheet induces atness
distortion and an outofplane dipole moment in a chair
conformer29.
