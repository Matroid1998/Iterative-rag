Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a well developed and studied class of material for carbon

capture applications;1116 in particular, hydroxidebased MOFs have been demonstrated to achieve

high capacities17,18 and high stabilities.11,15,16,19 In most cases a metalbound hydroxide will react
51
with CO2 to from a chemisorbed metalbicarbonate species (equation 1). However, in systems with
52
unreacted adjacent andor labile hydroxide anions, successive capture (eq. 2) and deprotonation
53
(eq. 3) steps may occur to from free bicarbonatecarbonate chemisorbed species. The interplay of
54
bicarbonate and carbonate species in hydroxide capture is well discussed in the context of humidity

Most notably  for all hydroxidebased sorbents  there is the fundamental

stoichiometric difference between bicarbonate (eq. 2) and carbonate (eq.
