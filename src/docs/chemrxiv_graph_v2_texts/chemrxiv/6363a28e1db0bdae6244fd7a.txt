Description:
Deintercalated from Sr2MnO2Cu1.5Ch2 to enable structural transformation.

Text:
The recent proofofconcept work of Cario 
and coworkers demonstrated that deintercalation of Cu from LaOCuS led to 
conversion of its antifluorite (Cu2S2)2 slabs into 2D arrays of (S2)2 dimers in LaOS.14 
Here, we present multistep deintercalation of Cu from Sr2MnO2Cu1.5Ch2 (Ch  
S, Se), leading to collapse of antifluoritetype (Cu1.5Ch2)2.5 slabs into 2D arrays of 
chalcogenide dimers while retaining structural integrity of their intergrown 
(Sr2MnO2)2.5 slabs. To achieve such a drastic structure transformation, we designed 
a synthetic pathway focusing on (1) chemoselectivity and (2) the use of reactive 
synthetic intermediates. Previous use of solvated I2 as oxidant successfully 
deintercalated 10 of the Cu15 from Sr2MnO2Cu1.5S2 enabling control of magnetic 
exchange pathways between Mn ion moments.

Description:
A metal that can be deintercalated using oxidants.

Further Cu deintercalation attempted 
at above 0 C or using stronger oxidants such as Br2 and NO2BF415 led to overall 
decomposition, so to circumvent such limitations, oxidants must be chemoselective 
toward removal of Cu while unreactive to the rest of the oxychalcogenide framework 
under the reaction conditions. Synthetic intermediates may circumvent large activation 
barriers, which are often encountered during topochemical anion redox. For example,
