Description:
Catalysts for the HER in acidic media that suffer from high cost and performance deterioration at high current densities.

Text:
The Pt catalysts for the HER in acidic media suffer from two major limitations 
including their high cost, which hinders largescale production7, and performance deterioration at 
high current densities due to catalyst restructuring issues8,9. Transition metal (e.g., Mo, W) carbides (TMCs) have been considered as promising alternatives 
to Pt catalysts for HER due to their low cost and Ptlike electronic structures10. Particularly, 
tungsten carbide shows exceptional performance (e.g., low overpotential and longterm stability) 
at high current densities stemming from its corrosion resistance nature and high electronic 
conductivity11. Tungsten carbide possesses multiple phases, such as tungsten monocarbide (WC) 
and tungsten semicarbide (W2C), exhibiting diverse electrocatalytic properties for HER12.
