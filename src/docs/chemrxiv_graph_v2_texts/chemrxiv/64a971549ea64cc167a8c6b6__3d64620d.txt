Description:
The capping sequence of developmentally regulated stage-specific embryonic antigen, SSEA1.

Text:
It is the trisaccharide capping sequence of developmentally regulated stage
specific embryonic antigen, SSEA1,27 and the L5 antigen involved in early neural development28 The Lewisx 
motif is also expressed on tumour cells29, 30 and present among human milk oligosaccharides31 and where 
it has been shown to protect against toxins and pathogens involved in childhood diseases.32 Lewisx is also 
expressed on the surface of pathogens such as gastric cancer causing Helicobacter pylori,33 and 
Schistosoma mansoni,34 the causative agent of the life threatening parasitic disease schistosomiasis, 
affecting over 200 million people worldwide
