Description:
Used in alkynylation reactions to give access only to ketones as products.

First applied to more reactive DonorAcceptor systems,8 less 
reactive Donoronly arylcyclopropanes could be also recently 
functionalized through oxidative activation to give radical 
cations (Scheme 1B).9 Photocatalytic methods have further led 
to 
new 
multifunctionalization 
reactions.10 
However, 
concerning alkynylation, success has been limited for a long 
time to cyclopropanols, giving access only to ketones as 
products.11 In 2021, Chen and coworkers developed the first 
photocatalyzed 
oxyalkynylation 
of 
the 
CC 
bond 
of 
aminocyclopropanes (Scheme 1C1).12 During preparation of this 
manuscript, Studer and coworkers reported in January 2022 
the first addition of EBX reagents to the CC bond of 
arylcyclopropanes (Scheme 1C2).13 Both methods required a 
careful optimization of additives and photocatalyst for success.
