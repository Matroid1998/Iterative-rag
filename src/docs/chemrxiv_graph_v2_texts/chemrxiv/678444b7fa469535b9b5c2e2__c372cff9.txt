Description:
An element used in doping to enhance the properties of photocatalytic materials.

Photocatalysts 1 are materials that facilitate photoreactions under light irradiation, typically by 
absorbing photons and generating electronhole pairs that drive chemical transformations 2. These materials are integral to various applications, including water splitting, carbon dioxide 
reduction, and environmental remediation. In the context of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), 
photocatalysts absorb light and utilize the energy to drive the reduction of protons to hydrogen, a 
clean energy carrier. The efficiency of photocatalysts in HER is heavily influenced by their 
electronic structure, light absorption properties, and charge transfer capabilities 3. Therefore, 
enhancing these properties through modifications, such as doping or structural design, has become 
a focal point for improving the performance of photocatalytic materials. One approach to improving photocatalytic activity is through nitrogen doping.

Description:
Introduces electron-rich sites in materials, altering electronic properties.

Text:
Nitrogen, with its 
higher electronegativity compared to carbon, introduces electronrich sites in the structure of the 
material, which can alter its electronic properties 4. Nitrogen doping has been shown to enhance 
the light absorption capabilities of semiconductors, particularly in the visible light range 5. This 
is achieved through the creation of new energy levels within the material, which lowers the band 
gap, allowing for more efficient photon absorption. Additionally, nitrogen doping can modify the 
charge carrier dynamics, promoting charge separation and reducing recombination rates, which 
are crucial for improving the efficiency of photocatalysts in HER 6. These modifications 
ultimately contribute to a materials increased photocatalytic activity under visible light. Similarly, the incorporation of oxygen into organic molecules can also influence the optical 
properties of photocatalytic materials 7.
