Description:
A nucleotide in DNA with biogenic crystals that have a high refractive index and significant reflectivity due to their densely stacked hydrogen-bonded layers.

scales, feathers, shells4 and reflective structures in eyes to improve 
vision in lowlight environments by reflecting light back into the retina5. The majority of 
biogenic crystals are made of guanine, a nucleotide in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The origin 
of the optical properties of these biogenic guanine crystals can be explained by understanding 
their crystal structure, which consists of densely stacked hydrogenbonded layers6,7. The plate
like morphology of guanine crystals formed in organisms leads to a high refractive index face 
with significant reflectivity for wavelengths in the range of visible light. Periodic variations in 
the refractive index (resulting from birefringence) leads to constructive interference, high 
reflectivity8, and the ability to scatter light to generate structural colours9.

Description:
Forms crystals with different functions compared to xanthine.

Text:
Understanding the structure of xanthine crystals will give 
insight into its role and optical properties and how this might differ from guanine crystal 
function, providing a greater understanding of why xanthine may form preferentially over 
guanine. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024tlgvb ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000254348673 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
