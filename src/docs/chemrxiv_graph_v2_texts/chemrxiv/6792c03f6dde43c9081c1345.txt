Description:
Complexes featuring 2quinolinecarboxylato ligands for catalytic dehydrative allylation of alcohols.

Text:
Kitamura and colleagues originally developed cyclopentadienyl (Cp) Ru(IV) complexes 
featuring 2quinolinecarboxylato ligands for the catalytic dehydrative allylation of alcohols.1,2 
Subsequently, Meggers adapted this class of catalysts for activating amines protected with 
allyloxycarbonyl (alloc) groups in biological environments, including intracellularly,3 and further 
enhanced their performance by incorporating 8hydroxyquinoline as a chelating group (Figure 1).4 
Following Meggers breakthrough, several research groups utilized CpRu(IV)quinoline catalysts 
for incell applications.5,6 Notably, Mascareas developed a triphenylphosphoniumfunctionalized 
a Ruquinoline catalyst that preferentially accumulated in the mitochondria of mammalian cells 
while retaining its ability to cleave an allocprotected prouorescent substrate.7 The Ward group 
conjugated one of these Ru catalysts to biotin, enabling its binding to streptavidin, and 
demonstrated that such an articial metalloenzyme could catalyze the deallylation of Nalloc
containing dyes.
