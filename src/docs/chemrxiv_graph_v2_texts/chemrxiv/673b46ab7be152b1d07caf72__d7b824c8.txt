Electrical energy storage devices play a crucial role in the transition from fossil fuels to 
renewable energy, as they efficiently store electricity generated from renewable sources, helping to 
mitigate climate change.1, 2 Lithiumion batteries (LIBs) offer advantages such as high energy 
density, long life cycles, and extended service life compared to other energy storage devices, making 
them one of the leading nextgeneration energy storage technologies.36 Electrodes, the key 
components of LIBs, are critical for determining their overall performance.7 Therefore, developing 
efficient electrode materials with outstanding chargedischarge performance, low manufacturing 
costs, and environmental sustainability is urgently needed.8 In recent decades, inorganic materials, 
such as transition metal oxides and layered inorganic compounds, have been predominantly used as 
electrode materials in both research and industry.9, 10 However, these materials suffer from 
significant drawbacks, including resource scarcity, high toxicity, complex processing methods, high 
cost, and rapid capacity degradation during cycling.11, 12 As a result, researchers have begun focusing 
on developing novel electrode materials.
