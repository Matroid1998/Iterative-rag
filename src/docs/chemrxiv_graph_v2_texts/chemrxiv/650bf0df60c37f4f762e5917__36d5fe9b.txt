Description:
Electron-rich alternatives to alkylphosphines with reduced susceptibility to oxidation.

Text:
Generally, the conjugate addition is favored for strong nucleophiles, which is why 
electronrich trialkylphosphines were among the first catalysts used in this type of 
reaction 11,12. Recently, our working group has investigated electronrich 
triarylphosphines 13,14,15 as viable alternatives to alkylphosphines, which often 
suffer from their pronounced susceptibility to oxidation. In this regard, we wanted to 
explore hydroxylsubstituted arylphosphines as potential candidates as well. Ortho
