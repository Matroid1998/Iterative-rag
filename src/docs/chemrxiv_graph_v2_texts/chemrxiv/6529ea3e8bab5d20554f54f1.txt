Description:
Used in asymmetric intermolecular aziridinations with chiral bis(oxazoline) ligands.

Text:
Early work by Evans and Jacobsen reported asymmetric intermolecular aziridinations with 
copper salts supported by chiral bis(oxazoline) (BOX)20 and chiral diaminebased ligands21, respectively (Scheme 
1A). Although satisfactory yields and ee were observed with only a few select substrates, these results stimulated 
the discovery of several catalytic systems for both asymmetric inter and intramolecular aziridinations that employ 
a variety of other metals, ligand scaffolds, and nitrene precursors.7,2224 Despite remarkable advances in both 
generality and efficiency, most of these methods, especially for intermolecular reactions, give the best results for 
terminal, styrenebased, and other conjugated olefins. In contrast, intramolecular aziridinations via NT exhibit 
superior reactivity and stereoselectivity with internal and unactivated olefins, yet have received much less attention 
(Scheme 1B).
