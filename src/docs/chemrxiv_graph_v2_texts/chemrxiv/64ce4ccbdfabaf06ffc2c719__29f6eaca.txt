Description:
A monomer used in the copolymerization process.

Text:
The copolymerization of styrene and various acrylate derivatives with POT led to statistical copoly
mers that were efficiently degraded under accelerated conditions (KOH in THFMeOH, TBD in THF or mCPBA in THF), 
confirming the theoretical approach. The compatibility with RAFT polymerization was established as well as the homopol
ymerization behavior of POT. This theoretical approach paves the way to the insilico design of new efficient thionolactones 
for rROP.
