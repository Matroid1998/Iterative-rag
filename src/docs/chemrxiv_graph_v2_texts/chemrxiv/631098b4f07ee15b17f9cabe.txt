Description:
A neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the cardiovascular and central nervous systems and is easily oxidized on an electrode surface.

Text:
Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the cardiovascular and central nervous 
systems. Therefore, high DA levels indicate cardiotoxicity leading to rapid heartbeat, hypertension and heart 
failure. On the contrary, low DA levels in the central nervous system are seen as the main cause of various 
neurological diseases such as Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimers disease, stress and depression 1. Therefore, it is clear that DA measurements are necessary to understand its biological functions and related 
biological processesmechanisms. Currently, there is a growing interest in developing specific and lowcost 
biosensors that take advantage of the ease with which DA is oxidized on an electrode surface.
