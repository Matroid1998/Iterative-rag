Description:
Used in the wet process to dissolve phosphate ore.

The phosphoric acid (PA) industry is essential for global food security, but it generates toxic and 
challenging wastewater (WW) of environmental concern. PA is the primary P source of the chemical 
fertilizer industry 1. With an estimated 46 million tonnes (Mt) of global demand in 201920 and steady 
growth of P output, global PA fertilizer production is expected to reach 52.5 Mt in 202526 2. PA is 
currently produced mainly by the wet process utilizing concentrated H2SO4 to dissolve phosphate ore 
comprising mainly hydroxyfluorapatite 3. Large volumes of water are required to facilitate the 
dissolution reaction and other tasks such as slurry transport, washing, and hydraulic pressurization 4.
