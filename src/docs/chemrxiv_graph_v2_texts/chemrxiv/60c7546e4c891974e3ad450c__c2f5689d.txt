Description:
Used in ring-opening metathesis polymerization to yield polymers with thermal characteristics similar to natural rubber.

Text:
Ringopening 
metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the resulting norbornene bearing oligomers finally 
yielded polymers with similar thermal characteristics as natural rubber (Fig. 1).14 Based on 
these results, we herein strive for exploring further applications of semitelechelic oligomeric 
1,4cisisoprenes containing ,unsaturated ester endgroups. Specifically, we aim at 
saponification of the ester group. We hypothesized that amphiphilic molecules with a low 
hydrophiliclipophilic balance (HLB) suited for stabilization of high internal phase emulsions 
(HIPEs) might be accessible by this approach.
