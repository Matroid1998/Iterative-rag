Description:
A choline metal halide compound.

Ionic plastic crystals (IPCs) have thus
far been explored mostly as solidstate electrolytes due to the large ionic conductivity
of the plastic crystalline phase 12. In this work, we seek to understand the barocaloric
and structural properties of the novel hybrid inorganicorganic IPCs, choline2CoCl4
and choline2ZnCl4. Choline, besides being a essential nutrient and basis for neuro
transmitter production 13, is a quaternary ammonium ion which readily forms plastic
crystalline salts with a variety of counter ions 14 as a result of its approximate glob
ular shape. Thus far, several choline metal halides compounds such as cholineFeCl4
14, choline3CuCl4Cl 15, choline4Cu4Cl10O 15 and cholineSnCl3 16 have
been reported.

Description:
A choline-based metal halide plastic crystal with reported structural phase transitions.

Text:
However, it is apparent that the reported crystal structures suffer from
the presence of disorder leading to either incomplete descriptions of the crystal struc
tures 15 or the inability to model the structure all together 14. Furthermore, with
the exception of cholineFeCl4 no structural phase transitions are reported for these
suspected plastic crystals. In this work, we present unprecedented structural analyses
of the phase behaviour of cholinebased metal halide plastic crystals. Xray diffraction techniques are inherently limited in their ability to probe the
fine details of the orientational disorder and dynamic nature of the plastic crystalline
phase due to the spatial and timeaveraged crystallographic models they produce.
