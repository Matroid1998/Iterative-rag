Description:
A typical anticancer drug.

However, to achieve this longterm goal, it is necessary to 
know how various CDmodified particles interact with drugs at the molecular level. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics 
simulations to study the interaction of a typical anticancer drug paclitaxel with micelles possesing a carboxymethylglycine hydrophilic 
shell and functionalized with  and CDs. The studied aspects of the interaction include localization sites of drug molecules in 
nanoparticles, the assessment of the drug effect on the surface properties of nanoparticles, the ability of various CDs to form inclusion 
complexes with the drug and their stoichiometric ratios. Materials and Methods 
Materials. All salts, solvents, lipids and other chemicals were from Sigma (St.Louis, USA).
