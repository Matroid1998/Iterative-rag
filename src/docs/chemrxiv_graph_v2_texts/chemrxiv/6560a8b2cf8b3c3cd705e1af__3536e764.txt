Description:
A redox active amino acid present in the A chain.

Text:
For this 
reason, A(4x) is currently being widely studied.47 
The use of electrochemical methods has become a complementary tool in biochemical 
studies related to the detection, characterisation and kinetic studies of A peptide aggregation.8 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and square wave voltammetry 
(SWV) are the most commonly used, fast and easy electrochemical techniques to study this 
processes through the oxidation processes of amino acids present in the peptide chain.8,9 Of all 
the amino acids present in the A chain, only three are redox active histidine (His, H), methionine 
(Met, M) and tyrosine (Tyr, Y).
