eventually aiding the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and safer drugs with optimal binding 
affinity to target biomolecules through specific pathways.3 Moreover, quantifying interactions 
between catalysts and reactants unveils invaluable insights into reaction pathways and kinetics, 
driving the finetuning of catalytic processes for industrial applications such as chemical or fuel 
production.4 In materials science, where intermolecular interactions govern material properties like 
strength, conductivity, and optical characteristics, their accurate quantification is paramount for 
engineering materials tailored for diverse applications in electronics, aerospace, healthcare, and 
beyond.5 Additionally, understanding interactions between early biomolecules, including nucleic 
acids and amino acids, serves as a crucial linchpin in elucidating the origins of life.6
