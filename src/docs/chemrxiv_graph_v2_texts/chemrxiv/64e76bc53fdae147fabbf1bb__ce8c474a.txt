Description:
Relatively soft donor ligands that can introduce interesting bonding regimes.

Text:
In contrast to Ln, the early 
actinides (An) exhibit variable oxidation states and 
participation in metalligand multiple bonding, 
which indicates greater involvement of the 5f (and 6d) 
valence orbitals in bonding regimes.2 This is 
important because the extent of covalency in 
chemical bonding has direct impacts on electronic 
properties and chemical behavior of Ln and An,3 and 
such differences are exploited in, for example, 
separations technologies.4,5 The use of relatively soft 
donor ligands, such as substituted cyclopentadienyls 
(CpR),68 can introduce interesting bonding regimes, 
and LnAn(Cp)3 type complexes have long been 
used as a computational testbed to investigate trends 
in the nature of felement bonding.913 
 Since the majority of Ln3 and An3 ions are 
paramagnetic, electron paramagnetic resonance 
(EPR) 
spectroscopy 
should 
carry 
important 
information on metalligand bonding, particularly if 
resolution of ligand nuclear hyperfine interactions 
can be resolved.
