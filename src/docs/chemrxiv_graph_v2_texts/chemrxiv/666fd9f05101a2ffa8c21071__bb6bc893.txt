Description:
Enables the stoichiometric reductive disproportionation of CO2 to carbonate and metal-bound CO.

cisMo(N2)2(PMe3)4) were notably found to enable the 
stoichiometric reductive disproportionation of CO2 to carbonate 
(CO32) and metalbound CO,2729 while on the other hand, the 
reverse comproportionation reaction of Mobound CO and 
CO32 is catalyzed by a bisphosphine supported Mo complex.30 
Recently, the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO mediated 
by Mo(CO)631 and later on by bipyridine (bpy) supported 
molybdenum carbonyl complexes (e.g. Mo(bpy)(CO)432, 
Mo(3allyl)(NCS)(bpy)(CO)233) has been investigated. Reactivity studies of related Mo complexes were extended to 
the coupling of CO2 with ethylene under formation of acrylic 
acid.3436 Bisphosphinearene complexes were employed as a 
platform to study the FischerTropsch related reductive 
coupling of CO to multicarbon products.37, 38
