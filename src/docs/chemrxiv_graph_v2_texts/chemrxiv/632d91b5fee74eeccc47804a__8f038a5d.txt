Description:
A conductive polymer synthesized by Bayer Company in 1988.

Since the discovery of the unprecedented conductivity of doped polyacetylene by Professors 
Hideri Shirakawa, Alan McDiarmid and Alan Heeger in 197714, there have been huge efforts 
to synthesize lightweight, conductive, flexible, chemically and thermally resistant polymers. Conductive polymers (CPs), especially those having small electronic band gaps, are promising 
materials for the production of flexible and lightweight optoelectronic devices, which are 
widely used in many hightech devices including wearable smartwatches58. In 1988, in an attempt to derivative polythiophene, researchers at Bayer Company synthesized 
poly (3,4ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) which became a breakthrough in the development 
of CPs9. Due to its high flexibility, stability, ductility and biocompatibility1013, PEDOT and its 
derivatives are now widely used as polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs)14, organic 
photovoltaics (OPVs)15, capacitators16, sensors17and biomaterials18.
