Description:
A cationic dye with a weak photophysical response that can be modified by substituting its molecular skeleton.

Text:
The drawbacks arising from the weak photophysical response
of ThT can be removed by proper substitution of the molec
ular skeleton, 27 however the cationic nature limiting its
efficient aggregation and compatibility to the hydrophobic
protein pockets still needs to be worked out. The remedy
for this problem is proposed in the present study. The se
ries of the dyes, shown in Scheme 1, possess the two parts of
fluorophore still separated by single bond allowing to con
formational equlibrium to take place. The previous study
devoted to their properties in solution, indicated that the
efficient FQY control can be obtained by the proper substi
tution with even mildly donating (D) or accepting (A) sub
stituents.
