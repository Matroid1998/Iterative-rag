Involved in unnatural enzymatic activities, particularly asymmetric free radical transformations.

Text:
Over the past decade, groundbreaking studies on unnatural biocatalysis have transformed the 
biochemical landscape of natural enzymes to encompass biocatalytic reactions that were never 
previously encountered in nature15. Recently, biocatalysis researchers have discovered a range of 
useful unnatural enzymatic activities, particularly asymmetric free radical transformations with 
metalloenzymes610 as well as nicotinamide11,12, flavin11,12, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)13
dependent enzymes. Together, these efforts substantially expanded the reaction territory of enzyme

catalysis and furnished powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis. Despite these notable advances, 
newtonature enzymatic CF bond formation has long eluded the biocatalysis community.
