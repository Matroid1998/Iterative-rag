Description:
Molecules whose motion affects NMR line shapes and can be analyzed for chemical shift tensors.

The experimental NMR line shapes are therefore directly related to the molecular 
motion of the CO2 molecules in the sample. In simple terms the more movement the CO2 
molecules exhibit, the narrower the measured line will be. For an overview of the methodology 
we refer the interested reader to an excellent review by Reimer et al.2 Commonly, the 
experimental line shapes are used to fit chemical shift (or shielding) tensors, which can be used 
to obtain relative positional and motional information about the CO2 molecules.57 The 
opposite route can however also be taken from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the 
trajectories of the adsorbed CO2 molecules are readily available. This information can be 
translated into a residual chemical shift anisotropy (i.e.
