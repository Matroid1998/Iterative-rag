Description:
Present in the naturally occurring members of the described compounds.

Text:
Their structures are characterized, as their name might 
suggest, by a spirocyclic indoline or indolenine motif, around which additional pyrrole and indole rings are 
structured, with at least one chlorine atom present in the naturally occurring members.1 Aside from 
representing rather unique topologies within the dimeric tryptophan alkaloids,2 these natural products were 
found to display moderate cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines.1 
Our group has recently developed an 
approach to the spiroindimicins bearing a 
central 56spirocyclic core, completing the 
first syntheses of spiroindimicin A (1) and its 
congener 
spiroindimicin 
H 
(5).3 
These 
syntheses relied on a key Pdcatalyzed 
spirocyclization 
to 
construct 
their 
core 
skeletons and small suite of analogues, 
screening of which revealed promising 
antiparasitic activity.
