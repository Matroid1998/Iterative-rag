Other successfully strate
gies (Yamago et al.13) use a squareshaped tetra platinum biphenyl complex as an
intermediate to selectively synthesize the 8CPP molecule. In the above mentioned
works, it was possible to obtain CPPs in the milligramscale, with Jasti et al.6,14
producing the rst gramscale synthesis. The smallest CPP synthesized up to day
is 5CPP,15 which shows the great success achieved so far in overcoming the strain
energy. Concerning the supramolecular packing, the solidstate (3D) structure of CPPs
