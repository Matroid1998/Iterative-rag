Description:
Undergo regioselective tandem CH alkylation-coupling reactions via C,CPallada(II) cycles.

Text:
Fluoroiodo ringsubstitued compounds, like 2ethenyl1fluoro3iodobenzene was 
involved in a variety of reactions regioselective tandem CH alkylationcoupling reaction of 
orthoiodophenylethylenes via C,CPallada(II)cycles 1, synthesis of dibenzob,foxepins 
by ringclosing metathesis 2, convergent synthesis of ()quinocarcin based on the 
combination of Sonogashira coupling and gold(I)catalyzed 6endodig hydroamination 3, 
total synthesis of ()quinocarcin by gold(I)catalyzed regioselective hydroamination 4, 
preparation of heteroaromatic macrocyclic ether chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of 
cancer 5, Lewis acid catalyzed formal intramolecular 3  3 crosscycloaddition of 
cyclopropane 1,1diesters for construction of benzobicyclo2.2.2octane skeletons 6.
