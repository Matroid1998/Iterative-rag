Description:
A heteroatom in the dihydro1,4thiazine skeleton of a moderately emissive dye.

Text:
The dye labelled SUMONLS protein showed clear staining in nuclear structures 
which were observed with differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging (Figure 4c,d). On 
the other hand, embryos injected with unlabelled SUMONLS protein showed very low 
autofluorescence which was not detectable at the same settings at which the dye labelled 
embryos were imaged (Figure 4e,f). Taken together, these results show that proteins can be 
successfully labelled with fluorophore F2. The labelled proteins retain their function and are 
detectable in vivo. In conclusion, we have designed and synthesised clickable singlebenzenebased fluorophores 
of 2F2CNCys and 2F2CN(NH2Ala). By changing the ring heteroatom from sulfur 
(dihydro1,4thiazine skeleton) to nitrogen (tetrahydroquinoxaline skeleton), we have 
transformed a moderately emissive dye to a highly emissive one.
