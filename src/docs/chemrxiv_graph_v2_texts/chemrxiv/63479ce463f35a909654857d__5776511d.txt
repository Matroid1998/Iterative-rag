Description:
Highly resistant to hydrolysis and can be recrystallized from boiling water.

These can also be 
described as a zwitterionic imidazolium trifluoroborate, which is highly resistant to hydrolysis and 
can be recrystallized from boiling water.911 Chansaenpak and coworkers reported that the 
trifluoroborate moiety can be significantly stabilized against hydrolysis by a proximal cationic 
functionality, such as a phosphonium unit, allowing for in vivo imaging.12 However, these are 
particular cases where it is possible to stabilize the BF3 adducts against water. Quinoxalines, pyrazines, and pyridines form redoxactive materials13, 14 when they are coordinated 
to BF3 in the nitrogen of the NHeterocycle. However, the reactivity of these materials against 
traces of water in nonaqueous electrolytes presents a challenge.
