Electronic cigarettes (ECs) contain atomizing units that are comprised of 
elementsmetals. Some atomizing unit components are preserved in all generations of ECs 1
4, while only fourth generation podstyle ECs contain connector platespins and magnets 5. Atomizer components usually include wires (copper, silver), a filament (nickel, chromium), wick 
(silicon), wire joints, which can be brass clamps (copper, zinc), solder (tin, lead), or braised 
wires 12, 4, 6. Some atomizer elements, such as chromium, lead, and nickel, are carcinogens 
and respiratory toxicants 710. While other atomizer elements, such as calcium, potassium, and 
magnesium, are less likely to cause harm 2, 4, 11.
