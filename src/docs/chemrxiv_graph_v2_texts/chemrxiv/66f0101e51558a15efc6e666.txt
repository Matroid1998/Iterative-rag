Description:
A gaseous element that dissolves in water, contributing to dissolved oxygen levels.

Text:
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) refers to the amount of gaseous oxygen that a water system contains. DO arises 
primarily from two main processes photosynthesis and diffusion from the atmosphere. Agitated 
water systems will dissolve more oxygen through diffusion, therefore flowing and tidal water systems 
are expected to have higher DO concentrations than stagnant or quiescent waters.1 Many 
environmental factors influence how much DO water can contain. Temperature, salinity, and altitude 
are just some of the natural factors that can limit the DO concentration. Dramatic and unexpected 
decreases in DO concentration typically result from contamination of the water source. The most 
common contaminants are bacteria and organic matter.

Description:
Quenches the luminescence of certain molecules, allowing for quantitative measurement in optical DO sensors.

Text:
Current approaches to 
DO sensing are based on optical or electrochemical detection mechanisms, both of which can be 
undertaken at a pointofinterest. Optical based DO sensors typically operate by measurement of the 
luminescence response of a molecule in the presence of oxygen, where oxygen typically quenches the 
luminescence. Higher concentrations of oxygen mean less luminescence, so a quantitative measure 
can be obtained.4 The luminescent species, typically an organic molecule, is provided as part of the 
overall device, simplifying the analysis. A drawback, however, is that luminescent species needs to be
