Description:
Shows comparably low OER activity, but lowering resistivity through compressive lattice strain increases OER activity.

However, it is hard to disentangle whether low electrochemical activity stems from high bulk resistivity or 
poor intrinsic catalytic properties13,14. The intrinsic catalytic properties reflect the ability to lower the 
kinetic barriers for the electrochemical reaction at the electrolytecatalyst interface, independent of their 
resistivity and additional stack resistances. For example, substituting Ni into the solidsolution series of 
La0.7Sr0.3Fe1xNixO3 induces a phase transition and increased oxygen vacancy content leading to an overall 
lower resistivity that correlates with the OER performance15. Furthermore, LaCoO3 shows comparably low 
OER activity in experiment, but lowering its resistivity through compressive lattice strain and introducing 
conductive support layers increases the OER activity16,17. Additionally, contact resistances (induced e.g.
