Description:
Unique ring motifs used for directly attaching to biorelevant structures.

Direct functionalization of the extensive existing library of lead compounds with unconventional ring motifs opens 
up exciting new chemical space for medicinal chemists (Figure 1A).1 However, introducing such rings is often 
more challenging than synthesizing the lead compounds themselves. In this context, several elegant 
approaches have emerged for directly attaching unique ring motifs, such as bicyclopentanes,2 cubanes,3 
cyclobutanes,2ac,4 oxetanes,5 and azetidines,2a,2b,6 to biorelevant structures, allowing practitioners to refocus 
on the challenge of synthesizing molecular scaffolds rather than the difficulties posed by these unique ring 
systems. 2a,2b 

As a class of privileged ring motifs, azetidines, small and strained nitrogencontaining heterocycles, offer various 
desirable attributes for drug development, such as innate rigidity, enhanced solubility, and improved metabolic 
stability.1a,7 Figure 1B showcases some representative bioactive molecules featuring the azetidine ring.
