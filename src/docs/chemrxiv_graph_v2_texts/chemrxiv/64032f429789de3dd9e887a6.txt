imaging further decreases the signal, limiting the achievable resolution to the submillimeter
regime on applicable measurement time scales. For that reason, measuring diffusion with mi
crometer resolution within thin lm materials, biological tissue or even for single cells is far out
of reach. An elegant solution to overcome the sensitivity problem of NMR is the nitrogen vacancy (NV)
center in diamond which is an atomsized quantum sensor for magnetic elds 15,16. Due to its
spin statedependent uorescence, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments
can be performed which translate the local magnetic eld into an optical signal. NVcenters have
been used to conduct NMR experiments on unprecedented length scales 1720 and allow the
detection of high spectral resolution NMR signals from picoliter sample volumes 2126.
