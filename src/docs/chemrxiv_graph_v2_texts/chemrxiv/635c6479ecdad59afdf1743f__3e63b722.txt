Description:
A green oxidant which decomposes exothermically to water and molecular oxygen.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a green oxidant which decomposes exothermically to water and 
molecular oxygen. The rate of decomposition of H2O2 can be controlled by its concentration, 
temperature, pH, and the presence of stabilizers or impurities. In an acidic medium, it forms 
a strong oxidant, more powerful than chlorine and potassium permanganate, such as 
piranha solution (in H2SO4) for cleaning glassware. The active oxygen content in H2O2 is 47 
ww which makes it a desirable source of oxygen 1. It is also a source of hydroxyl radical 
(OH). As a result, H2O2 is commonly used in organic syntheses (e.g. olefin epoxidation, 
aromatic hydroxylation, alcohol oxidation), advanced oxidation process (e.g. Fenton 
process), bleaching, disinfection, and wastewater treatment 2.
