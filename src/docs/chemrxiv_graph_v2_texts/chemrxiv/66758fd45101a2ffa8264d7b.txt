Description:
Produced in the body by the conversion of provitamin D upon light absorption.

Text:
Photochemical and photophysical phenomena in molecular
systems occur around us at every moment. Light absorption
initiates the chemical reactions at the basis of photosynthe
sis in plants1, activates the isomerization of the retinal chro
mophore in rhodopsin culminating in animal vision2, and con
verts provitamin D into vitamin D in our body3. For tech
nological and medical applications, the goal of understand
ing these and similar phenomena is the design of systems that
function as well as nature itself, to produce photovoltaic cur
rent upon absorption of light4, to label biological cells car
rying diseases to the human body5, or to produce light in a
clean and efcient way via electroluminescence in organic
light emitting diodes6.
