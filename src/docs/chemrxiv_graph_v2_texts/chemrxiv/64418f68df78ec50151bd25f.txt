Description:
Widely used in the synthesis of state-of-the-art quantum dots.

Text:
The development of biofunctional, tunable, and nontoxic nanomaterials has the potential to 
revolutionize precision medicine (e.g., biomedical imaging, therapeutics, and drug delivery). While 
zerodimensional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been explored as biomedical 
materials for the last two decades due to their unique optical and electrical characteristics, their 
immediate and downstream safety and material viability have hindered their potential uses in real
world applications. Heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Pb) have been widely used in the synthesis of state
oftheart QDs and have demonstrated suitability for many applications such as small molecule 
tracking1. In addition, these materials have been modified and biofunctionalized to be utilized for 
detecting viruses2 and bacteria3, in vitro cell imaging4, 5, and in vivo biomarker analysis610.
