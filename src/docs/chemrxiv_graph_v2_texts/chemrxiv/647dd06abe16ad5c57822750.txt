Description:
Contributes to atmospheric carbon fixation.

Text:
Diatoms are marine algae that produce about 4050 of the marine biomass with a 2025
contribution to the global primary production via photosynthesis for the entire food web
on earth. They also contribute to the atmospheric carbon fixation13. Like higher plants,
the lightharvesting (LH) process within diatoms is performed by proteinpigment complexes
embedded within thylakoid membranes. The major LH complex of the photosystem II (PSII)
of diatoms is a fucoxanthin and chlorophyll binding protein (FCP) containing fucoxanthin
carotenoids in the place of the xanthophylls present in higher plants4. Although the LH
complexes of higher plants and diatoms belong to similar protein classes with comparable
sequences, their absorption differs substantially due to the presence of different pigment
types5.
