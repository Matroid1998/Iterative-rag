Description:
A material used in thin-film solar cells with a bandgap similar to GaAs, achieving conversion efficiencies of up to 22%.

Text:
While CdTe thinfilm solar cells have achieved
impressive conversion efficiencies of  22,1 there
is a growing interest in the research community and
industry to reach practical efficiency limits approach
ing 28, which has been achieved by GaAs solar
cells with a similar bandgap, while retaining mar
ket leading cost.2, 3 There are several materials fac
tors that limit device efficiencies, including carrier
recombination in the bulk,4, 5 grain boundaries,
and interfaces.6 Studies indicate reducing carrier
recombination at the CdTe interface with the con
tact layers presents a significant opportunity to ul
timately increase device performance beyond 25 
efficiency.6, 7 Back contact optimization is likely to
enable further improvements in device efficiencies.8
Figure 1 shows the typical architecture of a super
strate CdTe solar cell with a transparent top (front)
contact, ntype emitter, and a holeselective back
contact to ptype CdTe.
