Description:
Catalyst used in the dehydrogenation of cyclic liquid organic hydrogen carriers.

Text:
Numerous studies identified the importance of platinum nanoparticle morphology in a wide variety 
of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.16 This also includes the dehydrogenation of cyclic liquid 
organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) over PtAl2O3 catalysts. For instance, the group of Somorjai 
intensively studied the structure sensitive behavior of the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane78 and 
methylcyclohexane (MCH).9 For the dehydrogenation of the LOHC perhydro dibenzyltoluene 
(H18DBT), remarkable activity changes were observed by Auer et al. for a nanoparticle size range 
from 1.2 to 4.6 nm.
