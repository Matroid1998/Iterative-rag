Description:
A product of photocatalytic processes and can be reduced to generate alternative fuels.

Text:
In the environmental field, photocatalysts can be used to 
remove pollutants in the air and water. The photocatalytic process can eliminate the total 
toxicity with products of CO2, water, and other fewer substances 6, 89. In the energy field, 
photocatalysts can generate alternative fuels such as H2, O2, and bioethanol via water 
splitting or reducing CO2 1013. In the photocatalytic process, photocatalysts are activated 
by a suitable light source to induce photocatalytic reactions. The use of light gives 
photocatalytic technology a great advantage compared to other waste treatment methods 
such as adsorption or filtration. However, the catalysts optical and electrical properties and 
photocatalytic mechanisms are not paid needed attention to compared to the sole efficiency
