The ongoing COVID19 pandemic caused by the SARSCoV
2 virus and its variants represents a once in a century pub
lic health disaster that continues to impact mankind, as 
well as the global economy.1 The disease has created an 
urgent need for rapid development of both preventative 
measures (e.g., vaccines) and postinfection treatment op
tions.2 Both aims have been achieved in record time, the 
latter initially being driven by investigations into repur
posing existing drugs, which has produced relatively few 
effective treatment options.3 The search for novel SARS
CoV2 antivirals, on the other hand, has led to the devel
opment of molnupiravir by Merck,4 EDP235 by Enanta,5 S
217622 by Shionogi,6 and several others.7 The first such 
antiviral to receive approval by the FDA, Paxlovid, is an 
orallyactive combination of the SARSCoV2 main prote
ase inhibitor nirmatrelvir (1; PF07321332) and the HIV 
antiviral ritonavir, disclosed by Pfizer in late 2021.8 This 
drug combination was shown to reduce risk of progression 
to severe COVID19 in highrisk, symptomatic patients by 
89 compared to placebo,9 exemplifying the crucial role 
the drug is expected to play worldwide in the continuing 
efforts to combat the COVID19 pandemic.
