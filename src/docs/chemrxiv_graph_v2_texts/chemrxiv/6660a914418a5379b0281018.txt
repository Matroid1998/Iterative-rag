Atomically thin two-dimensional semiconducting materials used in electronic and optoelectronic applications.

Text:
Atomically thin twodimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged 
as a new generation of semiconducting materials for electronic and optoelectronic 
applications.15 Despite their extraordinary application potential, challenges persist in 
harnessing their full capabilities. 2D TMDs are predisposed to form atomic defects, such as 
chalcogenide vacancies, that cause charge carrier trapping in defectinduced potentials and 
result in nonradiative recombination pathways, thereby reducing charge carrier mobility.68 
Additionally, the strong electrostatic interactions in 2D TMDs enable the formation of trions, 
quasiparticles composed of an exciton and free charges, even at room temperature.912 The 
existence of trions and defects strongly influence the intrinsic optical and electronic properties 
of TMDs. Despite extensive research focused on improving the semiconducting quality of 2D 
TMDs, the challenge remains in mitigating the defects within these materials.1320
