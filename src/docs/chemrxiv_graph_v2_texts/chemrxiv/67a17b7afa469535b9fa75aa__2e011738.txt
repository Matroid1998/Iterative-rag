Studied as plasticizers of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with enhanced ionic conductivity and oxidative stability.

For 
instance, ionic liquids including pyrrolidinium salts,11 alkyl ammonium salts,12 pyridinium salts,13 and 
imidazolium salts14 have been studied as plasticizers of SPEs and the resulting electrolyte mixtures all 
demonstrated enhanced ionic conductivity,15, 16 andor oxidative stability.17 However, given the vast 
range of possible chemical variations of ionic liquids and the complex formulation space, it is uncertain 
that these intuitionbased designs have achieved the most optimized plasticizer for SPEs (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the sparsity of available data18 and the inconsistency of experimental conditions in 
the literature19, 20 also prevents a straightforward adoption of machine learning strategies to analyze 
these materials. Thus, we envisioned that a simpler datadriven approach that establishes quantitative
