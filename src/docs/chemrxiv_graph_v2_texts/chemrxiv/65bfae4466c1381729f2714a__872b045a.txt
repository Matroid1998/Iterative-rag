Description:
Attached to human serum albumin for hypoxia-relieving combinational therapy.

General methods include delivering oxygen by 
oxygen carriers like Hb, PFC or oxygen production by decomposition of endogenous H2O2. Catalase or MnO2 takes role in this 12. Nanoparticles loaded with these oxygenproducing 
moiety and anticancer drugs are already studied. For example, Chen et al. coassembled 
catalase and human serum albumin (HSA) which is formerly attached with PS Ce6 and then 
conjugated with anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to generate HSACe6CatPTX for PTX 
induced intratumoral perfusion, hypoxia relieving combinational therapy 13. Yan et al. reported

mSiO2Ce6
ketoglutarateGOxmMnO2HA for multimodal imaging guided cancer therapy where 
MnO2 produces O2 and acted as MRI contrast agent and also promoted Fentonlike agent. Here, 
authors claimed that the generated O2 enhanced PDT by relieving hypoxia.
