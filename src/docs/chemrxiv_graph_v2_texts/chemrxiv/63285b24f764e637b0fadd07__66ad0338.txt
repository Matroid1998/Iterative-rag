Description:
Used in highly active and selective homogeneous catalysts for hydrosilylation.

Studies on the synthesis 
55 
of new Ptcomplexes are still continuing. Thus, in recent years, articles on the 
56 
development of new highly active and selective homogeneous Ptcatalysts of 
57 
hydrosilylation, in particular singleatom catalysts (SAC), were published.5 However, 
58 
Speiers and Karstedts catalysts still hold their position as the main industrial 
59 
hydrosilylation catalysts.1 Although these Ptcatalysts are efficient at rather low loads 
60 
(0.1 mol), the industrial consumption of platinum is high. In 2007, the organosilicon 
61 
industry consumed about 5.6 tons of platinum.6
