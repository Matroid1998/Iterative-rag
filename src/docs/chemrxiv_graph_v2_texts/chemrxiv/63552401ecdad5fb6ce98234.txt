11 12 Recently, the crucial role of microstructural aspects to inhibit Li 
dendrite growth has also been established.2 This convoluted interplay of mechanical and microstructural 
properties, dendritic growth, (electro)chemical and contact stability renders the designing of stable LMSE 
interfaces a difficult task. Uncontrollable SE decomposition at the LMSE interface poses an additional 
engineering challenge and motivates the investigation of SEs that are thermodynamically stable against 
LM as they may facilitate the LMSE interface. In search of new SEs, researchers investigated the compositional space between Li3N and LiX (XCl,Br,I).13 
As Li3N and the LiX salts are thermodynamically stable against LM all members on the quasibinary Li3N
LiX phase cuts were equally expected to be stable against LM. The numerous new phases discovered are
