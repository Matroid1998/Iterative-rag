Description:
A fluorescent probe used as a molecular rotor to monitor mitochondrial viscosity.

Text:
The local viscosity is the vital pa
rameter for perceiving realtime mitochondrial activity.7,8 
Conventional methods to measure the viscosity are applicable 
for the bulk solvent and cannot be utilized for the local viscos
ity at the microscopic level. The scientific community has 
exploited molecular probes to monitor the realtime, non
invasive, and spatialtemporal changes of viscosity.911 
Recently, fluorescent probes based on hemicyanine, pyridine, 
BODIPY, triphenylphosphonium (TPP), and rhodamine as 
molecular rotors to account for mitochondrial viscosity have 
been reported.1222 The highly negative potential inside the 
mitochondria 
matrix 
attracts 
the 
lipophilic 
cations. Lipophilicity 
allows 
molecules 
to 
permeate 
the 
cell 
membranes, and most of them contain delocalized cations that 
drive them into the mitochondrial matrix. Localization 
controlled by the reporter itself can create complications in 
interpreting fluorescent profiles.
