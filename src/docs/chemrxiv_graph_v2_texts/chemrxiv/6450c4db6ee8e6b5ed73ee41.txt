Furthermore, their photophysical properties are 
conducive to applications as photosensitizers, most notably in photodynamic therapy and 
oxygen sensing.24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 Interestingly, in the course of our photophysical 
studies on 5d metallotriarylcorroles, we repeatedly observed somewhat higher 
phosphorescence quantum yields for tris(ptrifluoromethyl)phenylcorrole complexes than 
for their more electronrich counterparts.27,3133 The observation made us wonder whether 
fluorinated substituents might have a beneficial effect on the luminescence properties of 5d 
metallocorroles. A photophysical study was accordingly carried out on the complexes 
depicted in Chart 1, except for the M  OsN, Ar  C6F5 case, which was not studied because 
of synthetic difficulties. We found that fluorinated substituents indeed appear to have a 
beneficial effect on the luminescence properties of the complexes, significantly increasing 
both the phosphorescence quantum yields and triplet decay times. Chart 1.
