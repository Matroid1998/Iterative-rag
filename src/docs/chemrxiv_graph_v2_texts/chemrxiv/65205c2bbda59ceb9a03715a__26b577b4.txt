5hydroxytryptamine (5HT), more commonly known as serotonin, is a signaling biochemical involved 
27

in many of the human physiology but most notably in the brain function. It is involved in the regulation 
28

of many physiological signaling including sleep, hunger, and mood control 1. It plays a crucial role 
29

in both the central as well as the peripheral nervous system 2,3. In particular, the role of serotonin in 
30

mental and physical health such as depression 4,5 and cancer 69 have been well documented 
31

10,11. As a result, there has been a high demand of medical diagnostics based on serotonin detection 
32

from biological fluids 1214.

Furthermore, accurate monitoring of serotonin in continuous time scale 
33

with high temporal resolution can help advance our understanding of the role of serotonin in many 
34

neurological disorders. 35

36

Various analytical methods including fluorimetry 15, radio immunoassay 16, enzyme immunoassay 
37

17, chemiluminescence 18 and mass spectrometry 19 have been used for the detection of 5HT. 38

Although many of these techniques achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detection, they are not 
39

ideal for in situ continuous and realtime measurement of an analyte from neurons or tissue samples 
40

due to many factors including bulkiness of the instrument, long measurement time, and a requirement 
41

for sampling and offline analysis to name a few.
