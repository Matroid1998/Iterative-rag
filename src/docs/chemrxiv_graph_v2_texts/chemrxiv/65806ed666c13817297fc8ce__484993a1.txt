formic acid or CO) to produce 
formamide.30, 31 Despite these distinctive methods, current studies on CN bond formation via 
NO3R mainly focus on coupling NO3R intermediates with C1C2 molecules (e.g. CO2, CO, 
formic acid, oxalic acid). There are a few recent reports on electrochemical NO3R systems 
which can build CN bonds in larger organic molecules (i.e. C3 compounds), such as amino 
acid32, 33 and oxime.3437 However, NO3R can make a variety of Ncontaining byproducts (e.g. N2, NH3, N2O, NO2), and therefore the understanding of the complicated NO3R reaction 
pathways and the controlling of N selectivity towards the desired organonitrogen products 
remain elusive.
