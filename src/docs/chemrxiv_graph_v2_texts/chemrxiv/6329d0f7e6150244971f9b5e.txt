Sustainable routes for the production of renewable energy and fuels, electrification of the chemical industry 
and pollution management are becoming increasingly attractive from both environmental and economical 
perspectives as renewable electricity prices continue to drop.1 Within this context, electrosynthesis, 
powered by renewable electricity, is an emerging green alternative to conventional thermochemical routes.2
4 Green NH3 production based upon this technology is a promising strategy to replace the energyintensive 
and CO2 emitting HaberBosch process, mainly used for the preparation of ammonia fertilizer.57 While N2 
is obviously the most abundant building block for this reaction, the intrinsic inertness of this molecule due 
to the high NN dissociation energy (941 kJ.mol1) as well as its low solubility in water, render its 
conversion to NH3 within an electrolyzer exceptionally difficult.
