Description:
Produced through commercial synthetic routes involving selective semihydrogenation.

Text:
The selective semihydrogenation of alkynes plays a crucial role in bulk industry, fine chemistry and chemical 
research.1 Examples of relevant applications are found in the hydrocarbon refinery for petrol industry,1c, 1e, 2 the 
commercial synthetic routes for Resveratrol or Vitamin A.1a Thus far, traditional systems for the selective formation 
of Z, E or terminal alkenes consist of PdC,3 Lindlar catalyst,4 Birch reduction,5 RaneyNickel6 or Wilkinson 
catalyst.7 Due to limitations regarding selectivity, activity, amount of produced waste or catalyst price, the study and 
improvement of these protocols has attracted numerous research groups in academia and industry.1a, 1b, 8 Thus, high 
activity and excellent selectivitytailoring is being achieved by combining finetuned ligands with noble metals such 
as Ru,9 Rh,10 Pd11 and Ir.12 During the last decade, the concerns in regard to Green chemistry principles have been 
grown rapidly13 and the development of catalysts based on earthabundant metals for organic transformations has 
become of very important.14 In recent years, several reports on selective alkyne semihydrogenations using catalysts 
based on Cr,15 Mn,16 Fe,17 Co,18 Ni,19 Cu20 are described.
