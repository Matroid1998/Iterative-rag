Description:
A compound with flexible ion incorporation at cation and anion sites, allowing optimization of crystal and electronic structure.

Text:
The wide range of ions that can 
be incorporated on both the cation and anion sites of an A3B2X9 compound allows both the 
crystal and electronic structure to be optimised by judicious choice of composition.2 Several 
strategies have been employed, from alloying on the halide site,8, 2325 which usually produces
