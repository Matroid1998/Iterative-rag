Description:
Porous materials used for applications such as gas storage, molecular separations, and catalysis.

Text:
We show that while porous molecular systems tend to pack
similarly to nonporous molecules, the topologies of their pore distributions resemble those of more
prominent porous materials, such as MOFs and COFs. Porous organic molecular materials are alternatives to extended
porous materials, such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) and
zeolites, for applications such as gas storage, molecular separa
tions, and catalysis because of their tunability and solution pro
cessability. Porous molecular materials form bulk materials in
the solidstate, in either crystalline or amorphous forms, with
structures governed by the interplay of weak intermolecular in
teractions between constituent molecular components.
