Description:
Exhibits a strong affinity for binding phosphates.

Text:
These aspects are significantly 
influenced by the diverse interactions of P with soil constituents involving free metal ions (Gros et 
al., 2019; Urrutia et al., 2013), soil minerals (Ahmed et al., 2019; Ganta et al., 2021; Kruse et al., 
2015; Kubicki et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2022), and soil organic matter (Ahmed et al., 2018a; Debicka et 
al., 2023; Gros et al., 2017). Among these constituents, mineral surfaces such as Fe and Al
(oxyhydr)oxides, calcium phosphates, silicates, and carbonates exhibit a strong affinity for binding 
phosphates (Bellier et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Minamisawa et al., 2022; Okano et al., 2013; Tunesi 
et al., 1999).
