Description:
Critical for developing low-carbon technologies and renewable energy systems, particularly in battery manufacturing.

Text:
Understanding the availability and risks associated with raw materials is crucial for numerous 
fields, particularly those focused on materials science, industrial ecology, and sustainability. As 
global demand for various elements increases, monitoring and analyzing their production and 
reserves becomes increasingly important. This knowledge helps researchers, policymakers, and 
industry stakeholders make informed decisions, ensuring the sustainability and security of supply 
chains. Raw materials are fundamental to technological advancement and economic growth. Elements 
such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earths are critical for developing lowcarbon technologies and 
renewable energy systems. These materials are essential for manufacturing batteries, wind 
turbines, and electric vehicles, which play a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
combating climate change 1.
