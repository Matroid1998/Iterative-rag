Description:
A byproduct of water splitting that can be produced with high purity through electrocatalytic or photocatalytic processes.

Text:
One of the most studied intrinsically endergonic reactions is water dissociation into H2 and O2. This 
reaction does not occur spontaneously under the standard conditions, G298 of the reaction 
2H2O  2H2  O2 is 113 kcal mol1. However, the reaction proceeds when energy is supplied by 
photons or electromotive force. When this energy in the form of electricity for electrolysis or light for 
photocatalysis is derived from renewable sources, the generated H2 is considered green. While the by
product of water splitting, O2, is less valuable, electrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting can 
afford oxygen of high purity to complement the existing air separation technology. An alternative 
approach considers generation of H2 from hydrogenrich organic compounds, coupled with their 
conversion into valueadded products.
