Description:
Chemistry that provides unique versatility for tuning material properties.

This is particularly relevant in sight of practical applications of these coatings, 
because the hydrophiliclipophilic balance of ORMOSIL can be widely tuned thanks 
to the unique versatility of silicon alkoxide chemistry 6, making these materials 
ideally suited for drug release 7. In this study, we report the outcomes of solgel 
material chemistry research applied to the SilverSil class of materials in view of 
practical applications aimed at developing practically useful SilverSil coatings for a 
wide variety of applications. Along with that of MTES, we investigate the use of 3
(aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) to prepare new SilverSil coatings. In 2011, 
indeed, Chen and coworkers reported the excellent antibacterial performance of an 
ORMOSIL derived from TEOS and 3(2aminoethylaminopropyl)trimethoxysilane 
subsequently impregnated with Ag NPs 8.
