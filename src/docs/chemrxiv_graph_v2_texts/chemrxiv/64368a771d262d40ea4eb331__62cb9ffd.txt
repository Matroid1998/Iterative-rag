Description:
Removed by wet etching.

Text:
The Ge is subsequently removed
by wet etching, NPG single crystals remain.30
In this work,
we study the influence of
the crystallographic orientation of the sub
strate on the formation of the Au oxide dur
ing HV electrolysis and the structure of the
NPG film formed by electrochemical reduc
tion. Such aspects can be investigated by using
oriented singlecrystal electrodes, an approach
widely used in surface science and electrochem
istry. For example, the facetdependent ox
ide formation has been studied on noble met
als such as Pt,31 Au,32 and on nonnoble met
als such as Al,33,34 Ni,35 Fe,36 or Cu.37,38 Con
way and Jerkiewicz, for example, found that
oxide formation occurs at different rates on
the Pt(111) and the Pt(100) facets.31 Vve
