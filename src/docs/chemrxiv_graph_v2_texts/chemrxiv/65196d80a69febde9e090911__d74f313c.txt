Description:
Used as an anode material in chloride ion batteries.

The interaction of halides with metal anodes is of gen
eral interest in electrochemistry, as halides are typical
anions present in electrolytes 13. Understanding the
interaction between adsorbates and metal surfaces is es
sential for designing efficient electrode materials for en
ergy storage and conversion applications 4. Recently
the interaction of chloride with lithium and magnesium
electrodes has become of interest in the context of chlo
ride ion batteries (CIBs) 57 in which lithium and mag
nesium can be used as the anode material 8.
