Description:
A click reaction used for conjugating fluorophores to actin filaments.

Text:
The presence of maleimide 
allowed the conjugation of the fluorophores to actin filaments through thiolene click 
reaction. Accordingly, we tested the use of these compounds to label and study actin in vitro 
and in vivo assays. Actin and SUMONLS proteins labelled with the 2F2CN(NH2Ala)based 
fluorophore F2 were localised to expected locations in vivo in zebrafish embryos. Studies 
related to incorporation of the parent fluorophore amino acids 2F2CNCYS and 2F2CN(
NH2Ala) into proteins through genetic code expansion are currently underway in our 
laboratory.
