Description:
Used in distilled water for plasma ignition studies with electrodes.

Text:
Limited studies,
however, provide direct visual insights into the
plasma within the vapor layer.20,21,3034
Following, we provide a brief overview of stud
ies using electrodes of various shapes. For
example, Schaper et al. used shadowgraphic
imaging to study the plasma ignition on a mil
lisecond timescale for different voltages at a
W rod cathode (0.5 mm diameter and 0.5 mm
long) with 0.9  NaCl in distilled water. For
low voltages, individual localized sparks were
observed, whereas at high voltages, the plasma
covered the entire electrode.
