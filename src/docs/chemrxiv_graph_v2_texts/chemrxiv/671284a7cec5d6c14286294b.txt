Description:
An exquisitely selective tool used to interrogate PIKfyve biology in vitro and in vivo.

Text:
Interest in inhibition of phosphatidylinositol3phosphate 5kinase (PIKfyve) as a therapeutic 
strategy has remained high since the seminal publication on apilimod, which touted it as a 
treatment for Bcell nonHodgkin lymphoma.1 Apilimod (Figure 1) has since been used as an 
exquisitely selective tool to interrogate PIKfyve biology in vitro and in vivo. We and other groups 
have used apilimod to uncover roles of PIKfyve in diseases beyond cancer, including inflammatory 
and autoimmune diseases,210 ALS and motor neuron diseases,1113 antiviral infections,1426 
myocardial interstitial fibrosis,27 and skin disorders.28, 29 Apilimod, however, may not be the best 
compound to be used clinically.
