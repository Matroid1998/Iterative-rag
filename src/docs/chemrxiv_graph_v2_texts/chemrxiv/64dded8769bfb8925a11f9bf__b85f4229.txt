Description:
Complexation with IrCp(PMe)3 is thermodynamically favored over oxidative addition of vinylic sp2 CH bonds.

Text:
The dominance of this pathway can effectively inhibit available mechanisms 
for vinylic CH activation, including oxidative addition.10 The selectivity contrasts the rich 
chemistry of aromatic sp2 CH or aliphatic sp3 CH bonds where substrate binding (coordination 
or complex formation) is typically reversible and a prerequisite for CH bond breaking by 
oxidative addition.11 

For example, Bergman and coworkers have studied the reaction of ethylene with the 16electron 
reaction intermediate IrCp(PMe)3. They found that complexation of the alkene is 
thermodynamically favored with respect to oxidative addition of vinylic sp2 CH bonds.
