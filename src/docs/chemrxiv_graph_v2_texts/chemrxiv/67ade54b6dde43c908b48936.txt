Key part of bioactive molecules and reagents for elaborate syntheses.

Text:
Azetidines and blactams are key part of bioactive molecules, worthy threedimensional bricks 
for medicinal chemistry, and reagents for elaborate syntheses (Scheme 1a).1 Few catalytic methods 
giving densely functionalized monocyclic products were reported. None could be readily switched 
to provide either azetidines or blactams, and the incorporation of an allylamino fragment, which 
is a vaunted structural feature,2 is similarly underdeveloped. The nucleophilic substitution has been widely used to create strained rings,1,3 but the synthesis 
of functionalized precursors is an open issue.

Can be accessed from biodo ynamides with N-protection.

Text:
For instance, lengthy linear sequences were used to 
prepare the relatively simple avinyl azetidine,3e,f which is a highly versatile species (Scheme 1b).4 
Elegant catalytic methods based on the release of ring strain have been presented.5 Nprotected 
azetidines can be accessed from biodo ynamides.6 These approaches require however the presence 
of sacrificial groups. Higher atomeconomy has been achieved by few EnergyTransfer (EnT)7 
methods. A strainrelease approach uses 1.1.0azabicyclobutanes and a Nsulfonyl diarylimine.8 
An intermolecular 22 photocycloaddition combines a bcarboxy oxime with a styryl fragment.9 
Sensitized arylmethacrylamides can deliver blactams via hydrogenatomtransfer (HAT)10 to an 
alkyl radical.11
