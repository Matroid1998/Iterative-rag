The best performing materials
thus far have achieved ZT  2 in a laboratory setting, including PbTe (2.5 at 973 K) and SnSe (2.6 at 973 K).1,2
Ideally, to compete with traditional energy conversion methods, materials with ZT  3 are needed to achieve a
2030 thermaltoelectrical energy conversion eciency. Maximising ZT is a complex task due to the interconnected nature of its components. A high Seebeck coef
cient is achieved by at, nondisperse electronic bands with large chargecarrier eective masses. Conversely,
a high electrical conductivity requires high chargecarrier mobility and relatively disperse band edges. At the
same time, high electrical conductivity leads to high electronic thermal conductivity (e T). Lattice thermal
conductivity is often the limiting factor in candidates that could otherwise challenge the current bestperforming
thermoelectric materials.
