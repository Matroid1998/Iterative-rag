Description:
A complexant used to hold back actinides in the aqueous phase during separation from lanthanides.

Text:
This has been used to 
61 
advance the separation of actinides and lanthanides, where complexants such as DTPA hold back 
62 
actinides in the aqueous phase while lanthanides are extracted into the organic phase.21,22 
63 
The competing effects of extractants and complexants contribute to the equilibrium 
64 
distribution of ions in bulk and interfacial liquids.
