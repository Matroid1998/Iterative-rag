Description:
A reagent used in dynamic kinetic processes to achieve high yield and enantiomeric ratio in coupling reactions.

Text:
To further demonstrate the synthetic potential of our protocol, a 
gramscale reaction of 2chloronaphthalene (1a) and benzylic zinc 
reagent (2a) was conducted, and the desired product was obtained 
in 88 isolated yield and 95.54.5 e.r. with only 0.5 catalyst load
ing (Figure 2A), highlighting the scalability and practicality of this 
protocol. Subsequently, the benzylic zinc reagent (2a) was de
creased to 1.2 equiv, and the coupled product 3a was still obtained 
in nearly quantitative yield with 955 e.r. (Figure 2B), which pro
vides strong evidence that the reaction takes place through a dy
namic kinetic process, rather than a simple kinetic resolution.

Used as a model substrate in density functional theory calculations.

To gain insight into the detailed reaction mechanism and the or
igins of chirality control of the extremely bulky DTBANIPE lig
and, we obtained the Xray crystal structure of Pd(L7)(3cin)Cl 
(Figure 2C). Based on this Xray crystal structure, density func
tional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using 2
chloronaphthalene 1a and benzylic zinc reagent 2a as model sub
strates (see the Supporting Information for the computational de
tails). The DFTcomputed free energy profile is elaborated in Fig
ure 2D. Based on previous theoretical studies14,15, the reaction ini
tiates with the coordination of 1a to PdL7, resulting in the com
plex int1.
