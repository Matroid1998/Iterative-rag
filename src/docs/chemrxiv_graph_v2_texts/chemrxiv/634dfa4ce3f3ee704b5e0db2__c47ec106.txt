Description:
A well-known prebiotic molecule that can participate in pathways forming precursors to RNA, proteins, and lipids.

Reaction pathways that are capable of generating biologically relevant molecules under prebiotic
2
constraints have been the subject of intense speculation.17 The RNA World is a hypothesis that
3
selfreplicating RNA molecules first emerged that were capable of a range of catalytic behaviors.811

This hypothesis has been partly spurred by the experimental discovery that hydrogen cyanide
5
(HCN), a wellknown prebiotic molecule, can participate in several pathways that form precursors
6
to RNA, proteins, and lipids (Fig. 1a).7,1215 However, establishing the kinetic relevance of these
7
pathways requires stepbystep reaction mechanisms that are difficult to experimentally obtain.
