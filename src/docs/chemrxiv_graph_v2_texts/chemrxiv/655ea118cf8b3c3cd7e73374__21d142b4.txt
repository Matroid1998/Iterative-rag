Description:
Exhibits strong broadband emission attributed to Sn-triggered extrinsic STE.

In this 
context, Li et al. claimed that Sndoped PEA2PbI4 (PEA  Phenethylammonium) have a strong 
broadband emission which is attributed to Sntriggered extrinsic STE24. On the other hand, Fang 
et al. found that the insensitivity of broadband emission to the PbSn ratio and slower decay 
suggested defects, not exciton selftrapping, as the source of this emission in 2D PbSn 
perovskite alloys26, 27. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. claimed that the broadband emission observed in 
PEA2PbI4PEA2SnI4 doublelayer heterostructures may be caused by charge transfer (CTE) 
emission at the PEA2PbI4PEA2SnI4 interfaces28. So far, the broadband emission in 2D mixed PbSn MHP systems has been mainly explored 
based on the physics perspective with the limited MHP compositions, relying on the 
understanding of exciton dynamics and lattice behaviors in such representative conditions.
