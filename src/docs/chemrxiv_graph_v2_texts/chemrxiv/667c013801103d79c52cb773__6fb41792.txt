Description:
A cubic rock salt polymorph of zinc oxide formed under high pressures and temperatures.

To impart new properties to oxide semiconductor materials, it is often necessary to introduce 
dopants 15, preferably in a wide range of concentrations. Such an opportunity is provided by 
cubic solid solutions of zinc oxide with a rock salt structure (Fm3m), which after synthesis can be 
quenched from high pressures and high temperatures in a wide range of concentrations of the 
second component. The application of high pressures is required in order to induce the phase 
transition from the initial wurtzite (P63mc) zinc oxide (wZnO) to cubic rock salt polymorph 
(rsZnO). As shown previously, the stability of rsMe1xZnxO solid solutions depends primarily on 
the properties of the Me2 cation, in particular its tendency to have an octahedral environment 68.
