Description:
A popular chemistry for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

The demand for lithiumion batteries (LIBs) is projected to 
increase significantly in the coming years, driven primarily by 
the increased use of electric vehicles (EV) and renewable energy 
storage systems. According to a recent study, the demand for 
LIBs could reach 10,000 GWh by 2040, and meeting this demand 
just through mining has significant challenges due to limited 
primary resources.1 Thus, achieving a sustainable Li supply 
depends on the presence of wellestablished recycling 
procedures for endoflife LIBs. Among various chemistries of 
LIBs, NMC chemistry (LiNixMnyCozO2) is the most popular 
choice when it comes to EV and energy storage systems.2 NMC
based LIBs come in several variants defined by their NiMnCo 
ratios e.g., NMC111 (LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2).
