Description:
Compounds used in DAC technologies for their strong affinity for CO2.

Text:
To date, DAC technologies have predominantly relied on chemisorption of CO2 using amines and solid 
alkali hydroxides, due to their strong affinity for CO2.5,6 However, the regeneration of adsorbents is the 
dominant source of the total operational costs.7,8 To mitigate these issues, physisorptionbased materials 
with weaker CO2 interactions have been explored to reduce regeneration costs with repeated usage.9 
Among these, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) stand out due to their high surface area and remarkable 
tunable properties.10,11 However, the chemical space for forming MOFs is vast due to the large number of 
possible chemical building blocks and topologies.
