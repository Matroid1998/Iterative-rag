Description:
Serve as acyltransfer reagents in nickel-catalyzed reductive coupling reactions.

Text:
Modern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to 
this area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical 
pathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild 
conditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of 
acyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and 
(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, 
alkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky 
reagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful 
strategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet 
highly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a 
practical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with 
unique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess 
amounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically 
used to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel 
catalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale 
applications.
