Description:
A support material for Pt clusters, affecting their catalytic properties.

Text:
They can even have properties specific to
their given size, such as the increased activity of Al2O3supported Pt7 clusters relative to Pt4
and Pt8 clusters3 for ethylene dehydrogention, or the sinterresistance of Pt3 and Pt7 clusters
on TiO2
5 or Pt4 and Pt7 clusters on Al2O3.6 These subnanocluster have also been shown
to be highly fluxional, meaning that they can populate and interconvert between multiple
isomers at catalytically relevant temperatures,7,8 and even dramatically change morphology
within the ensemble as the partial pressure of reactants changes.9 So far, the treatment
of fluxionality has been predominantly based on the thermodynamic picture, with cluster
ensembles represented by Boltzmann populations (pi) of each isomer, calculated via the
energy difference Ei between the lowestenergy structure and each higherlying one

This operates on the underlying assumption that it is possible for these clusters to reach to
tal thermal equilibrium on timescales relevant for the chemical reaction they are catalyzing.
