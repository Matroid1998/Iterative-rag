The presence of nitrogen functional groups in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products is essential 
to their beneficial physiochemical and biological properties.1,2 This importance of the carbonnitrogen bond has 
long inspired organic chemists to devise new methods for expedited and precise installation of nitrogen into 
compounds, advancements with significant potential to contribute to the identification and expansion of new 
chemical space. Toward this goal, transition metalcatalyzed nitrene transfer (NT) has emerged as an elegant 
strategy that directly transforms ubiquitous structural moieties, including olefins and CH bonds, into valuable 
nitrogencontaining building blocks.
