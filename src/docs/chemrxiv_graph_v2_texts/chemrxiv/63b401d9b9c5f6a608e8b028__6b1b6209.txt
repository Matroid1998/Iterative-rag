Description:
One of the most important silicone products.

Text:
Silicone polymers are widely used in applications ranging 
from lubricants, construction  automotive materials, 
electronics, medical formulations  engineered materials.1,2 In 
2020, the worlds production of silicones was over 8 million 
tons, representing a market value at 15.1 billion USD.3 Silicone 
polymers consist of SiOSi bound highly resistant backbones. SiO bonds are longer than CO bonds and the bond angle for Si
OSi is wider than that in carbon analogues. These materials are 
thus thermally stable, mostly chemically inert (except to strong 
acids and bases) and highly flexible.3 Recycling of these high
value inorganic polymers has become strategic for both 
environmental and economic reasons. Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) is one of the most important 
silicone products.

Description:
Recycled to value-added compounds such as cyclic monomers or functional oligomers.

Text:
Most of them are produced through the 
hydrolysis of chlorosilanes that are prepared via Rochow direct 
process,4,5,6 then the associated production of cyclics (mainly 
D3 and D4) that are subsequently polymerized in the presence 
of a based catalyst.7 Although Silicon (Si) is an abundant 
elemental in the earth, the production of the Si metal grade 
necessary for the Direct Process is highly energyintensive 
requiring extremely high temperature (1400C).8 Moreover, it 
also releases a substantial amount of greenhouse gases 
detrimental to our environment.9 Recycling of outofspecs or 
endoflife polydimethylsiloxanes to valueadded compounds 
such as cyclic monomers or functional oligomers thus emerges 
as a highly desirable and potentially sustainable solution.
