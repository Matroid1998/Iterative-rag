Description:
Doped in carbon materials to enhance optical properties compared to pure carbon clusters.

Text:
Replacing CC units with BN groups in pure carbon cluster will prompt electron 
transfer or rearrangement due to disrupting molecular symmetry, thus affecting the 
optoelectronic properties of the system. Recent studies on the secondorder NLO 
properties of carbon nanoribbons,32 nanographene,33 and nanotubes34 have shown that 
BN doped carbon materials exhibit superior optical properties compared to pure carbon 
clusters. By adjusting the doping mode of BN fragment, the electronic structure of the 
system can be further changed, thereby regulating its NLO response.33 In 2019, 
Pichierri27 replaced the CC units of the C18 with BN groups and observed that this 
substitution positively altered the optical activity of the molecular ring.
