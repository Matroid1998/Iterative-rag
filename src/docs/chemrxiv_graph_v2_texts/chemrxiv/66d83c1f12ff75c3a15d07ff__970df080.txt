Description:
A frontrunner in solid polymer electrolytes due to its high safety, ease of processing, low cost, and good compatibility with lithium metal.

Text:
The 
pioneering work of Wright and Armand in 1970s ignited the interest and passion for research 
into solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for rechargeable solidstate batteries.1,2 Since then, 
polyethylene oxide (PEO) has become a frontrunner in SPEs due to its high safety, ease of 
processing, low cost, and good compatibility with lithium metal, making it attractive for 
integration into nextgeneration LMBs.3,4 High molecular weight PEO offers the benefits of 
preventing Li dendrite formation due to its superior mechanical properties and enhancing 
cycling stability compared to its lower molecular weight counterpart.5 However, ionic 
conductivity of PEO at room temperature is inadequate (up to 106 S cm1) because its semi
crystalline structure which hinders chain mobility, essential for ion transport, often requiring 
higher temperatures for effective application.
