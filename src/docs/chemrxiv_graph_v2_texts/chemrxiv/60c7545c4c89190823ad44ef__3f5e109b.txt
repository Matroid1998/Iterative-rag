Description:
Used in the form of activated carbon for adsorbed xenon propellant storage.

Text:
We investigate the feasibility of an alternative xenon storage strategy, with the objective of reduc
ing the mass of the storage materials required to carry the xenon propellant into space packing
the pressure vessel with a porous adsorbent material to help densify the xenon (i.e, use an ad
sorbent in combination with pressurization). Activated carbon has been investigated for adsorbed
xenon propellant storage, but it does not reduce the mass of the storage system 10.

Description:
A traditional adsorbent used in storage systems, often in the form of activated carbon.

Text:
Our hypothesis is that the optimal storage pressure for the adsorbed xenon storage system is lower
than that of the bulk xenon storage system, thereby allowing for thinnerwalled and thus lighter
pressure vessels in the adsorbed storage system. The important question our model addresses is
whether the reduced mass of the pressure vessel in the adsorbed xenon system compensates for
the (added) mass of the adsorbent required to store the xenon at a lower pressure. The answer
to this question depends on the xenon adsorption isotherm in and density of the nanoporous ma
terial. We assess several nanoporous materials for xenon propellant storage, using experimentally
reported xenon adsorption isotherms as input to our model. We nd that MOF505 and NiMOF74
outperform the traditional adsorbent, activated carbon.
