Description:
Organic materials found in leaf waxes.

Determining the degree of (dis)ordered structure of these organic materials at the fundamental 
length scale of a few chain repeats (nanometerscale) is crucial across a number of sectors for 
understanding properties such as trans film diffusion, density, congealing point, and hardness4, 
as well as underpinning understanding of how water and agrochemical active ingredients 
interact with plant crops.5 
Here, we focus on a reduced set of long chain hydrocarbons found in leaf waxes. Different 
plants and varieties have very different compositions, but we focus on the Schefflera 
elegantissima plant, a simple plant consisting mainly of long chain alkanes and alcohols. Studying this simple system may lead to the discovery of features that can be linked to plant 
performance across many different species.
