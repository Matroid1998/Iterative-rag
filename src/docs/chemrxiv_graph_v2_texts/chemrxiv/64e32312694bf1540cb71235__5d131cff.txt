Description:
A thermoelectric material with a maximum ZT of 2.2 at 915 K.

To first approximation, S, 
and el are interrelated through the carrier concentration n such
that the best balance of a large PF and minimal el is typically
obtained for heavilydoped semiconductors. On the other hand,
latt is largely independent of the electrical transport and should
be minimised to obtain a large ZT. A wide variety of inorganic materials have been explored
as thermoelectric (TE) materials, including chalcogenides,1014
metal oxides,1518 clathrates,1922 and skutterudites.2326 The
current industrystandard TEs are Bi2Te3 (ZTmax 1 from 359 
450 K) and PbTe (ZTmax  2.2 at 915 K).2729 However, Pb is toxic
and Te has a low terrestrial abundance of ca. 1 ppb,30 comparable
to Pt, and is required for other technologies such as photovoltaics.
