Compounds used in nucleophilic addition reactions with organometallic reagents.

Tertiary alcohols containing two aryl groups and their ether derivatives feature across a number of 
11 
pharmaceutical classes (Scheme 1a).1 As such, the efficient synthesis of this motif draws widespread 
12 
interest. Traditional approaches rely on nucleophilic addition of stoichiometric organometallic reagents to 
13 
ketones.2 However, these intermediates can be difficult to prepare and are frequently air and moisture 
14 
sensitive. An alternative, streamlined strategy for construction of this motif from widelyavailable feedstocks 
15 
would be the catalytic intermolecular hydrofunctionalisation of 1,3dienes with carbonyl compounds.3,4 
16 
Beyond minimizing stoichiometric metallic waste, this strategy can offer increased functional group tolerance 
17 
with the products featuring a useful CC bond in close proximity, poised for further functionalisation.

Description:
Challenging substrates in allylation due to lower electrophilicity and increased steric demands.

Text:
A range 
18 
of such reactivity has been investigated with aldehyde (or maskedaldehyde) coupling partners, initially by 
19 
Mori5 and Le Gendre and Mose6 before being extensively developed by the groups of Krische712 and 
20 
others13,14 as a contemporary revolution of classical allylation chemistry. However, ketones remain 
21 
challenging in all but a few limited cases (see below),15 likely due to their lower electrophilicity and increased 
22 
steric demands relative to aldehydes. 23 
Two notable solutions to this problem have been developed. Buchwald and coworkers,1619 and also later 
24 
Xiong and coworkers,20 reported the coppercatalysed, enantioselective allylation of ketones with 1,3
25 
dienes which proceeds through a ZimmermanTraxler type transition state (Scheme 1b). As a result, 
26 
branched rather than linear products are obtained.
