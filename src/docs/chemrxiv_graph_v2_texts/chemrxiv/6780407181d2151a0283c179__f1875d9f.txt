Description:
A terpenoid alkaloid found in the defensive secretions of Petaserpes rosalbus.

Text:
All millipedederived terpenoid alkaloids are produced by a single 
subterclass, the Colobognatha, which is a monophyletic group and 
consists of four species rich orders. Colobognath millipedes possess 
unique characteristics that set them apart from all other millipedes, 
including feeding primarily on fungus, forming large aggregations, and 
exhibiting other social behaviors such as egg care.1,2 The size of these 
aggregations varies greatly, but some have been observed to contain 
over 100 millipedes.3 Despite the interesting biology observed in 
Colobognatha, few studies have focused on the chemical composition 
of their defensive secretions, with only three terpenoid alkaloids 
reported prior to 2020, all being discovered from the defensive 
secretions of species within a single order, the Polyzoniida.47 These 
includes buzonamine (Buzonium crassipes), polyzonimine (Petaserpes 
rosalbus) and spiropyrrolizidine Omethyloxime 236 (Rhinotus 
purpureus).
