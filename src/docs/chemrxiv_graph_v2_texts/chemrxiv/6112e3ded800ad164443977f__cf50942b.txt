Description:
An estrogen receptor modulator with significant biological activity.

Molecules with allcarbon tetrasubstituted alkene structural 
motifs, such as the estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and 
idoxifene,14 amongst others (Figure 1A), have displayed signif
icant biological activity and found widespread applications in 
the pharmaceutical industry.59 Moreover, their unique photo 
and electrochemical properties have rendered them particularly 
useful for molecular switches1011 and material science.1214 De
spite this rising demand, the stereoselective synthesis of 
tetrasubstituted alkenes has been a longstanding challenge and 
as a result only a few synthetic approaches have been reported 
in recent years.1519 While key progress in this field has been 
achieved by employing traditional olefination methods, these 
transformations often suffer from low atomeconomy and poor 
stereoselectivity.2023 One of the most commonly applied syn
thetic strategies is the carbometalation of internal alkynes, fol
lowed by a metalcatalyzed crosscoupling.2428 This elegant ap
proach has set the stage for a plethora of useful tetrasubstituted 
alkene syntheses, but is often associated with serious limitations 
regarding stereocontrol and functional group tolerance.
