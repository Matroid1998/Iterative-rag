Description:
A group incorporated into molecular backbones to achieve triplet excitons.

Text:
The population of triplet 
excitons has largely been achieved through molecular engineering tactics, such as incorporating 
heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, P, B), heavy atoms (like Br, I), carbonyl groups, or twisted structures 
into the molecular backbone. On the other hand, suppression of nonradiative processes has 
been accomplished through methods like crystallization1517, embedding molecules in polymer 
matrices1820, hostguest supramolecular assembly2122, and more. Recently, a groundbreaking 
design strategy has emerged for achieving efficient RTP materials with prolonged afterglow, 
involving the doping of one specific compound into the matrix of another2328. Unlike 
conventional singlecomponent RTP materials, the ultralong emission of these bicomponent 
RTP systems is contingent upon the synergistic interaction between the two blended 
components25, 29. Without either component, the ultralong emission would not occur.
