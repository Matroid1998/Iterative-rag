Materials used for anchoring molecular ligand sites to bridge the gap between molecular and solid catalysis.

Text:
For a more specific tailoring of the ligating sites and 
46 
accordingly the electronic properties of the metal, the anchoring of molecular ligand sites on silica 
47 
materials has bridged the gap between molecular and solid catalysis. This heterogenization strategy 
48 
on solid surfaces covered the immobilization of amines2023, phosphines2326, Nheterocyclic 
49 
carbenes27,28, bidentate PN ligands23,29,30 or pincer ligands3133. The resulting catalysts were active
