Description:
Involved in hydrogenation reactions under transient conditions.

Text:
However, we have already shown that 
conventional kinetics, derived under steadystate conditions, may 
fail to describe the CO hydrogenation under transient 
conditions.10 Hence, transient kinetic models have to be 
developed, which consider processes such as addesorption 
steps or surface reactions.9,11 Microkinetic models, which take 
precisely these aspects into account, have already been used for 
the simulation of dynamic CO and CO2 hydrogenation. However, 
these models require profound knowledge of the underlying 
reaction mechanism and sufficient experimental data for model 
parameterization.1114 
For this purpose, sophisticated transient experimental methods 
are necessary, which carry respective information on the 
dynamics of the involved reactions.
