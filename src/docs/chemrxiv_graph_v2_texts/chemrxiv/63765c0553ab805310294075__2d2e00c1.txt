Description:
1J values are suggested to serve as structural constraints.

Text:
In the latter regard, 2JCCC values depend strongly on the rotameric properties of the C
O bond involving the central carbon, and less so on the rotameric properties of the CO bonds 
involving the coupled carbons.1113 Direct (onebond) Jcouplings (1Jab) have a strong 
dependence on bond length, with larger values corresponding to shorter bond lengths (greater s
character).1,1416 Despite suggestions that 1J values could serve as valuable structural 
constraints in saccharides,1718 detailed conformational interpretations of them have proven 
challenging.1924 
Experimental determinations of saccharide conformation often rely on computational 
methods such as density functional theory (DFT) or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.2529 
Current approaches combine experimental parameters with appropriately restrained calculations 
to derive a model that best matches the experimental data.2934 While this approach has proven 
valuable, it is not without limitations stemming from limited experimental validations of the 
computational methods.
