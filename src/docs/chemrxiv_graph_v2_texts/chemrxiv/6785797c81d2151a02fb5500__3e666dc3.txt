Description:
Compounds used to obtain Heck-type products chemoselectively.

Text:
of two distinct, orthogonal functional groups into 
the CC bond in a single step. Herein, we report a photoredox catalyzed Rittertype carboamidation of electronically diverse styrenes 
harnessing nonstabilized, nucleophilic primary radicals generated from readilyaccessible carboxylic acidderived redox active es
ters. Furthermore, it was found that Hecktype products were chemoselectively obtained by simply switching aryl olefin acceptors 
with 1,1diarylolefins. In the context of photocatalytic chemodivergence, various trisubstituted alkenes were synthesized. Both Ritter
Type and Hecktype olefin carbofunctionalizations were scalable up to 4 mmol scale in batch and continuous flow. INTRODUCTION 
Nitrogencontaining organic compounds are prevalent in natu
ral and pharmaceutical relevant motifs, with over 90 of drug 
molecules market incorporating nitrogen atoms.1 Given this sig
nificance, the development of strategies for CN bond for
mation is of critical importance.
