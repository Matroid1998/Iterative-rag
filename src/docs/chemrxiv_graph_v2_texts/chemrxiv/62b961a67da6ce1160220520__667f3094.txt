Description:
Displays a layered crystal structure and exhibits bright, stable, and long-lived near-infrared fluorescence.

The tailoring of surface functionalization therefore 
plays a role of paramount importance for the achievement of 
enhanced colloidal stability, longer circulation times and 
improved biocompatibility. The possibility of decorating these 
nanomaterials 
with 
(bio)molecules 
of 
interest 
could 
furthermore allow therapeutic treatment, sensing and imaging 
applications19. Egyptian Blue (CaCuSi4O10, EB) is the most ancient pigment in 
the history of mankind, having its origins dated back to Ancient 
Egypt ( 2500 BC)20,21. This calcium copper tetrasilicate displays 
a layered crystal structure which allows to prepare nanosheets 
(NS) via simple stirring in hot water2227. Most interestingly, it 
has been shown that the bright, stable and longlived near
infrared (NIR) fluorescence of the bulk material (em  910
930 nm)2530 is preserved in exfoliated NS down to just few 
tenths of nm in size31,32.
