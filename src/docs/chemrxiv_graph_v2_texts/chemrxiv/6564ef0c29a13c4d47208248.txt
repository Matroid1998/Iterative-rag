Description:
A material for which electronic density of states (eDOS) can be predicted using a sparse Gaussian process regression model.

Text:
Mahmoud et al.30 proposed a sparse Gaussian process regression model to predict 
the electronic density of states (eDOS) of silicon structures. In this research, we present a sophisticated deep learning model developed for DOS calculations. The model incorporates essential 
structural information, pair distribution function, and atomic embedding representations as its input parameters. By combining these
