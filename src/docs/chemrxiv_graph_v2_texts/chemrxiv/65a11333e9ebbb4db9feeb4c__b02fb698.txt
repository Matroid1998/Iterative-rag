Compounds involved in the solid-state chemistry of inorganic metals.

The
presence of these open questions contrasts with the true metal
halides where nearly every feasible composition has been struc
turally characterized, from extreme oxidation states (e.g. VCl5)10
to highly radioactive compounds (e.g. EsCl3).11 Pseudohalides
thus offer synthetic inorganic chemists the rare opportunity to
create new (pseudo)binary compounds (Fig. 1). In this review, I describe what is known about the solidstate
chemistry of inorganic metal thiocyanates. It presents a system
atic overview of their structures and highlights opportunities for
developing their chemistry further. The very extensive chemistry

 As is standard, where thiocyanate is bonded purely through N it has been written as
M(NCS)x, and when through S as M(SCN)x.

Description:
Involved in structural analogies with other inorganic solid-state compounds.

In most of the described binary frame
works thiocyanate is both N and Sbound and for these M(NCS)x is used without
implying anything about the local bonding. Other older trivial names for thiocyanate include rhodanide and sulfocyanide. of thiocyanate in solution or with coligands has been excluded
as it is wellcovered elsewhere.3,12,13 The review summarizes the
chemistry of the binary M(NCS)x for every nonradioactive metal,
and the structure of every ternary metal thiocyanate MM(NCS)x. Special attention has been paid to the structural analogies be
tween metal thiocyanates and other inorganic solidstate com
pounds. I have relied, in addition to the primary literature,
on two book chapters Golub, Khler and Skopenko (1986)14
and Williams (1948),15 which are the most comprehensive sum
maries of metal thiocyanate chemistry thus far published.
