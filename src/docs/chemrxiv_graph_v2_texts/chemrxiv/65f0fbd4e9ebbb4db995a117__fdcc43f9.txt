Description:
Emerging benzene bioisosteres used in drug development.

Text:
Bridged ring systems represent longstanding targets for organic chemists because they are 
versatile skeletons of natural products and pharmaceuticals.14 Among them, saturated 
bicyclon.1.1alkanes have emerged as attractive synthetic targets because they are becoming ever 
more important in the design and development of new pharmaceuticals.510 For example, 
bicyclo1.1.1pentanes,11 bicyclo2.1.1hexanes12 and bicyclo3.1.1heptanes13,14 are emerging 
benzene bioisosteres (Scheme 1A). Replacing planar benzene rings with such threedimensional 
bicyclic molecules could potentially ameliorate physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, 
thereby increasing the odds of drug development success. In addition, bicyclon.1.1alkanes are 
widely present in natural products1518 or as key intermediates to complex molecules19 (Scheme 
1B).
