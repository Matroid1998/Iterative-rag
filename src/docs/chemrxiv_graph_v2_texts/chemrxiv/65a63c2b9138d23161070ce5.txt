Description:
A reference electrode potential used in electrochemistry.

Text:
Firstly, increasing the electrode potential (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode 
(RHE)) shifts the glycerol oxidation selectivity from weakly to strongly oxidized products. More 
specifically, the dominant products shifts from glyceraldehyde (at less than 0.9 V vs RHE) to glyceric 
acid and tartronic acid (between 0.9 V and 1.2 V vs RHE), and finally to formic acid (at 1.44 V vs 
RHE).7,9,1113 The formation of formic acid means that Pt is able to break CC bonds, but only under 
very strong oxidizing conditions.11 Secondly, when glyceraldehyde is produced under alkaline 
conditions, it quickly isomerizes in solution and turns into lactic acid.13,21 Thirdly, another way to 
favor more oxidized products is to lower the glycerol concentration.
