Description:
A high-entropy boride synthesized using borothermal reduction with improved hardness of 27 GPa and fracture toughness of 4.47 MPa.m12.

Text:
developed another composition of HEB (Hf0.2Mo0.2Ta0.2Nb0.2Ti0.2)B2 synthesizing using 
borothermal reduction of the corresponding metal oxides at 2000C and achieved a sinter 
density of 98.5 3. The reported composition displayed an improved hardness 27 GPa and 
fracture toughness 4.47 MPa.m12. The research work done by Zhang et al. showed that HEB 
powder of the (Hf0.2Zr0.2Ta0.2Cr0.2Ti0.2)B2 system, synthesized through borothermal reduction 
can achieve a much higher sinter density within the range of 95.0  99.2 5. Whereas the 
HEB powder synthesized utilizing borocarbothermal route could reach a relative sinter density 
of 96.3  98.5. They also showed the reported composition with nearly full densification 
can achieve remarkable hardness (28.31.6 GPa). In addition to the enhanced physical properties, excellent mechanical, as well as 
thermomechanical properties, are also of increasing concern.
