Description:
Incorporated as a 5' cap to protect mRNA against premature degradation.

Text:
mRNA export and the role of the poly(A) tail 
mRNA acts as a carrier of genetic information and is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, serving as 
a template for protein production by the ribosomal machinery.1,2 The efficiency of protein production is greatly 
dependent on mRNA stability and the turnover of mRNA in the cytoplasm is constantly regulated by numerous 
protein complexes to maintain proper protein levels.3,4 Eventually, after translation, all mRNA undergoes 
degradation, however, aberrant mRNA degradation may lead to disease.5,6 Two general mechanisms protect 
mRNA against premature degradation which are incorporation of a 7methyl guanosine (m7G) as a 5cap and 
by connection of a polyadenine stretch (poly(A) tail) to the 3terminus.
