Description:
A fossil fuel used in the production of hydrogen.

Text:
Hydrogen is potentially the 
most sustainable and cleanest transportation fuel 4, 5 and is already used in fuel cells. It produces no 
pollutants nor greenhouse gases while having a high energy capacity 5. The primary advantage of 
hydrogen is that it can be transported and stored with minor losses using the current chemical fuel 
infrastructure with some modifications 6, making a smooth transition from fossil fuels possible. Nowadays, the majority of hydrogen, c.a. 95, is produced from fossil fuels via processes like methane
