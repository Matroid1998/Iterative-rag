Description:
A substrate for sialidase with poor cleavage efficiency by AfSA.

Text:
Moore and coworkers discovered a 
gene encoding for a putative sialidase (AfSA) in the genome 
sequence of A. fumigatus.10 In comparison to bacterial SAs, AfSA 
showed poor efficiency in cleaving the Nacetylneuraminic acid 
(Neu5Ac) substrates and was also poorly inhibited by the SA 
transition 
state 
inhibitor 
2deoxy2,3dehydroN
acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en).11 2keto3deoxynononic 
acid (KDN), a member of the sialic acid family with an hydroxyl 
group in C5 instead of an acetamide, was shown to be the 
preferred enzymatic substrate. Subsequent studies confirmed 
that AfSA is a KDNase (AfKDNase) with a suggested nutritional 
role in the life cycle of the fungus. While SAs are widely studied 
virulent factors much less is known about KDNases.
