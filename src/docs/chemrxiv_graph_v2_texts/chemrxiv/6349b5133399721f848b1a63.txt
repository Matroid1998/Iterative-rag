Description:
Compounds that can exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with narrow emission profiles due to their rigid structure and short-range charge transfer nature of the emissive excited state.

who demonstrated how p and ndoped nanographenes, termed multiresonant TADF 
(MRTADF) emitters, could also exhibit TADF but with much narrower emission profiles.12 The nar
row emission spectra were rationalized in terms of the rigid structure of these compounds together with 
the shortrange charge transfer (SRCT) nature of the emissive excited state.10
