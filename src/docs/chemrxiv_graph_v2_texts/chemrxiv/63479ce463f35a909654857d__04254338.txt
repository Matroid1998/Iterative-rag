Description:
A Lewis acid involved in the formation of HBF4 in the presence of water.

Text:
As reported15 by Wamser, the 
mechanism of the formation of HBF4 from Lewis acid BF3 in the presence of water, shows a series 
of intermediate stages, which are summarized in equations 1 to 3. BF3  H2O  HBF3OH (1) 
HBF3OH  H2O  HBF2(OH)2  HF (2) 
HBF3OH  HF  HBF4  H2O (3) 

where successive reactions with water leads to the formation of boric acid, hydrofluoric acid, and 
tetra fluoroboric acids. Herein, we synthesized five Nheterocycles BF3 adducts (Figure 1). We replicate the synthesis of 
Py(BF3)2 (1) and Q(BF3)2 (2). Additionally, we reported the synthesis of three new BF3 adducts;
