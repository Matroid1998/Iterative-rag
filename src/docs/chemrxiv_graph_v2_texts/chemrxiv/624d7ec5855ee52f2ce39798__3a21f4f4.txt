Description:
A compound studied in complex with GtPyNP using MD simulations based on a crystal structure.

Text:
Indeed, MD simulations (using 
GROMACS59,60 with the CHARMM3661 force field) based on 
our recently disclosed crystal structure of GtPyNP in complex 
with uridine (PDB ID 7m7k,4 see the SI for details) yielded 
several insights in support of the proposed model. First, an 
analysis of the clustered states over 50 ns simulation time
