Description:
Reacts with photosensitizers to form highly reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Text:
In PDT, photosensitizers are optically excited followed by a transition to the triplet state, 
which further reacts with biological substrate or surrounding oxygen to form highly reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) (16). These species induce a high oxidative stress and a pronounced level of 
photodamage inside the tumor cells, resulting in cell death. As 5ALA and thus PPIX are specifically 
enriched in brain tumors, their application in PDT was expected to be a promising approach. Several 
studies were performed to investigate the potential of 5ALAPDT for PDT applications (1719). Eskiler 
et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of 5ALAPDT in the treatment of breast cancer (20), whereas its 
photodamaging capabilities on rhabdomyosarcoma were shown by Atif et al. (21). Hypericin is a promising alternative photosensitizer for PDT.
