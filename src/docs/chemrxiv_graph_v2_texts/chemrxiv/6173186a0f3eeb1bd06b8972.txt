Description:
A crystal used in frequency measurements, where mass changes affect its frequency.

of CON solutions resulted in a decrease in the quartz crystal 
frequency, corresponding to an increase in the mass on the crystal surface (Figure 1(C)). To 
remove any nonspecifically bound CON, HPB was subsequently introduced into the QCMD 
chamber. The final mass change was 0.62 and 2.11 ngcm2 for 10 M CON and 50 M CON 
solutions after considering the hydration of ssON and dsON 39, corresponding to 1.7X1013 C

5 

ONcm2 and 5.6 X1013 CONcm2, respectively. Figure 1 (C) gives a comparison of the mass 
change in response to CON and NcON solutions passed through the flow cell. The resulting 
mass change was two and sixtimes larger for 10 M and 50 M CON target solutions, 
respectively, compared to that for NcON.
