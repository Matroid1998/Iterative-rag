Description:
A moiety whose reactions are affected by the electronic nature of the acyclic twisted amide.

of a nonepimerizable surrogate 
for the primary amide. For construction of the bbranched tyrosine 
moiety of the eastern fragment 4, a broad range of strategies were 
evaluated (Figure 2, strategies BD). Linkages of this type are 
extremely rare and notoriously difficult to obtain synthetically. Indeed, no successful strategy has been uncovered to date.1920 
Attempted nucleophilic substitution reactions under either neutral, 
anionic or halogenideAgfacilitated conditions led consistently to 
either formation of the corresponding unsaturated dehydroamino 
acid or decomposition of the substrates (Figure 2b, strategy B, see 
SI). Attempts to utilize addition of the histidine imidazole to an acyl 
aziridine moiety were hampered by the electronic nature of the 
acyclic twisted amide such obtained (Figure 2b, strategy C).
