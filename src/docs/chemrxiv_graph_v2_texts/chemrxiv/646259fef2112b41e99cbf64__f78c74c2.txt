Description:
Incorporated into SIC polymers to facilitate ion conduction via cation solvation.

As a result, liquid solvents7,8 or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)9,10 are often incorporated into SIC 
polymers to facilitate ion conduction via cation solvation, though such strategies remain limited by 
inherently slow polymer segmental relaxation (in the case of PEO blending),11 or they may reduce 
electrolyte stabilitysafety (in the case of solvent addition).3,12 
Inspired by the high ionic conductivities of solid ceramic ion conductors such as the Lithium Super Ionic 
Conductor (LISICON) family,13 recent SPE designs have sought to exploit an ionhopping or decoupled 
mechanism, wherein cations move between relatively stationary anionic sites at rates that are decoupled 
from polymer segmental relaxation,11 the latter of which is inherently unable to provide cation mobility 
on par with ceramics and liquids.14 Decoupled ion conduction is thought to be favored in materials that 
possess crystalline andor highlyordered, rigid anionic channels.
