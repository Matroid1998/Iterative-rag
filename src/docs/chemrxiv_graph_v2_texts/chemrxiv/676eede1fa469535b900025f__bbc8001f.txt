Facilitates rapid Na-ion transport.

This promise was bolstered by the low 
melting points of Na and S and the discovery of rapid Naion transport in alumina, which 
catalyzed interest in liquidelectrode systems.2 However, recent advances in room
temperaturecompatible aprotic electrolytes have revived the interest in NaS batteries that 
function at ambient temperatures.3 
Recent NaS systems with heavily cocktailoptimized liquid electrolytes have exhibited 
impressive performance, showing an initial capacity of 1635 mAhg (sulfur weight basis) at 
0.1C, with 56.7 capacity retention over 200 cycles and high coulombic efficiency.4 However, 
even these advancements fall short of the highperformance criteria required for largescale 
energy storage and mobility applications, particularly given the 10 year lifespans now 
standard for conventional Liion batteries.5 This raises the question of whether electrolyte 
engineering alone can overcome the fundamental challenges inherent in sulfurcathode cells, 
such as (i) polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and (ii) significant volume changes during 
redox cycling, both of which contribute to chemomechanical degradation at the cathode
electrolyte interface.
