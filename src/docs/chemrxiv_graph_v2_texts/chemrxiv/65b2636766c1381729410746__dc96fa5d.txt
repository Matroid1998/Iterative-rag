Description:
Used as the conversion-type electrode material within FIBs.

Text:
FIBs have the potential of reaching both superior gravimetric and volumetric energy 
60 
density than LIBs, which is of interest for electric vehicles and other largescale energy storage 
61 
applications 7. Hence, considering F as a stable ion for the charge transfer in the battery is a 
62 
viable promising alternative. 63 
The research on FIBs focused strongly on conversiontype cathode chemistries, i.e. 64 
metalmetal fluorides (MeMeFx) 810 which offer the highest theoretical capacities due to the 
65 
possibility of taking part in a multielectron conversion process. For example, Fichtner et al.11 
66 
reported on the use of CuF2 as the conversiontype electrode material within the FIBs.
