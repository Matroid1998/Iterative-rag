Description:
Used in the treatment of Sb2Se3 to passivate defects and improve photovoltage.

Several strategies have been presented in the literature such as Te incorporation 
for defect passivation,5 sulfurization treatment for improved photovoltage6 and gradient sulfur 
doping in Sb2Se3.7 More fundamental insights into the basic optoelectronic properties for defect 
passivationsuppression for Sb2Se3, however, have not yet been reported. In this work, we employed time resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) and photoluminescence 
(PL) spectroscopy to gain fundamental understanding of the defect passivation mechanism in 
Sb2Se3 by sulfur treatment. We investigated the charge carrier dynamics of Sb2Se3 before and after 
sulfur treatment using TRMC and observed the passivation of deep defects in Sb2Se3 as evidenced 
by longer carrier lifetimes. We also show that the passivation of deep defects reduces not only 
surface recombination, but also bulk recombination using a wavelength dependent TRMC study.
