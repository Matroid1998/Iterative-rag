Popular candidates for renewable energy applications despite being expensive, unsustainable, and toxic.

The thermodynamic hydricity of a molecule measures the free energy of a heterolytic M
H (metallic hydrides) or CH (organic hydrides) bond dissociation.14 Reactions involving
hydride anions play a crucial role in various renewable energy technologies, such as the elec
trochemical reduction of CO2 into carbonbased fuels510 or H2 synthesis.8,11 The hydricity
is therefore a key property in an important class of renewable energy reactions, as the free
energy of hydride transfer from a donor molecule to an acceptor is given by the dierence in
their hydricities. Traditionally, transition metal hydrides have been the most popular candidates for such
applications,1 but many of these metals are expensive, unsustainable, and toxic.12 Organic
hydrides such as dihydropyridine5,6 and benzimidazoles7 are promising metalfree, renew
able alternatives to their costly counterparts.
