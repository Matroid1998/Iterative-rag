Description:
Commonly found in enzymes.

Text:
Over onethird of all proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and half of all classified enzymes contain metal ions.123 These 
metalloenzymes are a part of crucial processes such as cellular respiration, nitrogen fixation, protein degradation and DNA 
replication.45 The most common metal ions found in enzymes are magnesium, zinc, sodium, calcium, iron, and manganese.246 
For instance, over 20 of all transferases, lyases, isomerases and ligases contain magnesium in the binding site, whereas zinc is 
found in at least 10 of all enzymes in each Enzyme Commission class.2 
Since metalloenzymes are involved in so many important processes, their inhibition is sought for the treatment of different 
diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis C, cancer, hypertension, arthritis, and infections.35 For instance, the angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) plays a pivotal role in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance.789 ACE contains a Zn2 
as cofactor, which is involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of several peptides, such as the hydrolyzation of the hormone angiotensin I 
to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.78910 ACE inhibitors, such as captopril and enalapril, are used in the treatment of 
medical conditions like hypertension, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.10 The binding affinity of ACE 
inhibitors is partially driven by the interaction with the zinc ion in the active site, e. g. enalapril contains a carboxyl group that chelates 
the metal ion, while captopril contains a thiol group that interacts with the ion.10 
A large database and analysis platform for metalloenzymes, the Metalloenzyme Data Bank and Analysis (MeDBA) platform has 
also been published.611 MeDBA contains information about metalloenzymes, their ligands and metalloenzymeligand interactions 
derived from the Protein Data Bank.
