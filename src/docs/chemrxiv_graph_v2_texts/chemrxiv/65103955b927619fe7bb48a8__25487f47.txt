Description:
A functional group present in diol substrates that can retain or generate a stereocentre.

To access Nheterocycles substituted at the position to the 
nitrogen, retrosynthetic analysis would suggest this methodol
ogy may be extended to diol substrates containing a secondary 
alcohol, to retain or generate a stereocentre. Although this has 
been demonstrated asymmetrically, the scope remains limited 
to few examples solely employing benzylamines, due to poor 
chemoselectivity often affording diamine products through 
multiple intermolecular amination reactions.7,8 Therefore, addi
tional deprotection and alkylation steps are required to access a 
wider range of products. While intramolecular hydroamination 
offers an alternative route to these scaffolds through cyclisation, 
much of the recent research has focused on CH substitution at 
this position.
