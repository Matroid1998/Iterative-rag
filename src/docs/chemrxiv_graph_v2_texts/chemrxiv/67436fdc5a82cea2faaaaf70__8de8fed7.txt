Description:
Formed by the oxidation of Fe2 during the delithiation of Li2FeS2 to Li1.5FeS2.

Considering this range, the theoretical capacity 
of Li2FeS2 amounts to 400 mAhg1, exceeding the theoretical capacity of NCM811 that 
is 280 mAh g1 but coming at the disadvantage of a lower potentials of operation. Nonetheless, Hansen and coworkers10 recently proposed that the reaction is limited to 
the chemical space between Li2FeS2 and Li0.5FeS2 relating to a theoretical capacity of 
300 mAh g1 in the investigated voltage range, as corroborated by other reports.11 This 
conclusion is reached by stateofcharge dependent characterizations using insitu X
ray diffraction as well as exsitu Fe and S Kedge XANES experiments.10 The proposed 
reaction mechanism is as follows10,12,13 first the delithiation of Li2FeS2 to Li1.5FeS2 is 
charge balanced by the oxidation of Fe2 to Fe3.
