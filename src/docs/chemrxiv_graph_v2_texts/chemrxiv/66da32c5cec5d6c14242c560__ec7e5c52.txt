Description:
Molecules related to thymine, with halogenated derivatives acting as potent radiosensitizers.

Text:
Upon absorption of UV photons or attachment of an excess electron, radiosensitizers generate 
highly reactive photoproducts that damage or destroy the cancer cell.7, 8 Halogenated uracils have been 
widely recognized as representative radiosensitizers, sharing structural analogies with thymine (Thy, 
Scheme 1), and are commonly substituted for Thy in DNA strands.914 This substitution does not 
significantly alter biological structure but exhibits a potent radiosensitizing effect. Despite the considerable 
importance of halogenated uracils, a fundamental understanding of photochemical processes in these 
molecules remains incomplete. Notably, the influence of solvation on the excited state relaxation process 
has been relatively overlooked, despite its anticipated significant impact on relaxation dynamics compared 
to those in an isolated environment.
