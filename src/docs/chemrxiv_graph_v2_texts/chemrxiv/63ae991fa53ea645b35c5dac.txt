Description:
A chromophore core that undergoes photoisomerization, switching between cis-trans or trans-cis states.

FusionRed also displays
promising photochemical properties, with excitation (emis
sion) at 580 nm (608 nm) and a high extinction coefficient
(EC) at 94,500 M1cm1, which contributes to the proteins
remarkable efficiency in forming protein fusions 1. For these
reasons, FusionRed has been used to develop new in vivo
and in vitro imaging tools such as fluorescent biomarkers
and reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins 6. Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (rsFPs) are no
table for their ability to undergo a lightmediated confor
mational toggle (i.e., isomerization) between nonfluorescent
(off) states and fluorescent (on) conditions 7. This inducible
photoisomerization is due to the 4(phydroxybenzylidene)
5imidazolinone (pHBDI) chromophore core undergoing a
switch from cistotrans or transtocis 7.
