Description:
Used as a solvent and COCl2 precursor in UV-light irradiation synthesis.

However, in 
recent years triphosgene itself has been reported to be highly toxic,6 and an alternative method is 
urgently needed. The ondemand synthesis of COCl2 through the UVlight irradiation of chloroform 
(CHCl3) was recently reported,7 which is a simple method that incorporates safe and inexpensive 
CHCl3 as the solvent and COCl2 precursor. This method requires highenergy UV light, which induces 
the decomposition of COCl2 as the product as well as the versatility of the substrate. However, although 
reactions with nucleophiles such as alcohols proceed efficiently, they are not suitable for the synthesis 
of carbamoyl chlorides from lightunstable amines.
