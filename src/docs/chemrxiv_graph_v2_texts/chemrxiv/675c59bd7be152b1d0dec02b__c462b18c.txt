Used as more cathodically-stable electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries.

Improvements are still needed to enable lithium (Li)ion batteries to meet the 500 Whkg 
target for batterypack level energy density set for electric vehicles.1 Replacing the graphite anode 
with Li metal in stateoftheart Liion batteries is a promising approach, but practical 
implementation is challenging due to insufficient Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) in liquid 
electrolytes, which must be 99.98 for 80 capacity retention at 1000 cycles.2 Over the past 
decade, considerable improvements have been made to Li CE using diverse electrolyte design 
strategies,3 including switching from carbonatebased4 to more cathodicallystable conventional5,6 
and fluorinated7,8 ethers; and promoting pairing of Li with anions beneficial for the solid 
electrolyte interphase (SEI), such as in highconcentration electrolytes (HCEs)911 and localized 
HCEs (LHCEs)1214.
