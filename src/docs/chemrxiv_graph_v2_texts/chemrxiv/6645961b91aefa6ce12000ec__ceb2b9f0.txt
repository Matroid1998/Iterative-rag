Description:
Nonplatinum group ORR catalysts with tunable functional groups for optimizing activity and selectivity.

Text:
Such plots
show that Pt is near, but not at, the theoretical peak activity of metallic surfaces, and that a signifi
cant overpotential will remain unless these LFESRs can be broken or circumvented by a novel class
of catalyst.2 As a result, new catalytic materials are sought to push catalyst activity past typical
volcano plot scaling and provide alternatives to Pt.35
Porphyrins and MNC sites more generally have attracted considerable attention as nonplatinum
group ORR catalysts with high theoretical limiting potentials2 and experimentally demonstrated
activities competitive with Ptbased catalysts.6 Because of the tunability of functional groups on
these porphyrins, their activity and selectivity toward either the twoelectron or fourelectron ORR
can also be optimized,7,8 making them promising scaffolds on which to build next generation ORR
catalysts.
