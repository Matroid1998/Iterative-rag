Description:
Macrocyclic compounds that can bind alkali metal ions within their cavities.

Text:
In 1967, Charles J. Pedersen reported the discovery of a new 
class of macrocyclic compounds, the crown ethers,1 and their 
ability to bind alkali metal ions within their cavities that would 
later be described as if the ion had fallen into the hole in the 
center of the molecule.2 JeanMarie Lehns subsequent work 
on bicyclic analogues of the crown ethers  named cryptands  
demonstrated the power of extending these host systems into 
three dimensions (Fig. 1).3 This work would see Pedersen4 and 
Lehn,5 alongside Donald J. Cram,6 win the 1987 Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry for their development and use of molecules with 
structurespecific interactions of high selectivity.
