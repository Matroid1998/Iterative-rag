Description:
A photocleavable group used to prevent binding of inhibitors.

Text:
reported a caged PROTAC 
approach whereby photocleavable 4,5dimethoxy2nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group was introduced to prevent 
binding of panbromodomain inhibitor JQ1 to BRD4.20 The same caging moiety was also attached to the 
immunomodulatory drug thalidomide to block the recruitment of E3 ligase cereblon for Brutons tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) degradation. In both cases, proteolysis was observed only after uncaging of the PROTAC.
