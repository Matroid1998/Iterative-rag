Description:
A reactive nitrogen species known to inhibit ATP production by oxidatively deactivating mitochondrial ATP synthase.

Text:
Adenosine5triphosphate (ATP) is known as the molecular currency for intracellular 
processes.12 ATP concentrations range between 1 to 10 mM, with a 10001 ratio between ATP 
and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).3 ATP aids the regulation of important cellular processes, 
which include cellular movement,4 neurotransmission,5 and ion channel function.6 Thus, 
disruption to ATP homeostasis is linked to a number of diseases, including ischemia, Parkinsons 
disease and hypoglycaemia.7 The cause of this disruption is often associated with oxidative 
stress, which involves the production of highly reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen 
species.89 In particular, peroxynitrite (ONOO),10 is a RNS that is known to inhibit ATP production 
by oxidatively deactivating mitochondrial ATP synthase.11 Several other studies have revealed a 
correlation between ATP and ONOO concentrations to a range of pathological processes.1214 
Therefore, the development of a chemical tool that allows the real time monitoring of these 
species simultaneously in vitro and in vivo would be highly desirable.
