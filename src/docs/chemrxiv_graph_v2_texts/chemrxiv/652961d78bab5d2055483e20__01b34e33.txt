Description:
A highly stable substance with no safe level of exposure.

Text:
In June 2022, published 
updated interim Health Advisory values for PFOA and PFOS, concluding that the lifetime interim 
Health Advisory for PFOA3 is 0.004 ngL (4 parts per quadrillion (ppq)  0.006 of the 0.07 
gL (70 parts per trillion (ppt)) values published in 2016) and for PFOS4 is 0.02 ngL (20 ppq  
0.03 of the 70 ppt 2016 value). These updated values indicate that in practice there is no safe 
level of these abundant, ubiquitous, highly stable substances.
