Description:
A crucial element whose consumption is enhanced in cancer cells due to uncontrolled growth and glycolysis.

Text:
The uncontrolled cell growth and extravagant glycolysis in cancer cells enhance oxygen 
consumption 13. Moreover, insufficient oxygen supply occurs due to low oxygen 
permeability, high interstitial fluid pressure 46. These induce stress factors in cancer cells 
like hypoxia. Then cancer cells take adaptive response by overexpression of angiogenesis and 
vascularization which upregulate transcription gene hypoxiainducible factor (HIF1) 7, 8. Stabilizing in hypoxic condition, HIF1 subsequently develop upregulation of numerous drug 
resistance proteins and factors including drug efflux transporter Pglycoprotein (Pgp) 8, 9. The Pgp transporters efflux cytotoxic drug from cells for reducing intracellular drug 
accumulation cause MDR 10, 11. So, overcoming hypoxia and MDR by producing oxygen 
is very crucial for cancer therapy applications.

Description:
Produced by decomposition of endogenous H2O2 and used in hypoxia-relieving therapies.

Text:
General methods include delivering oxygen by 
oxygen carriers like Hb, PFC or oxygen production by decomposition of endogenous H2O2. Catalase or MnO2 takes role in this 12. Nanoparticles loaded with these oxygenproducing 
moiety and anticancer drugs are already studied. For example, Chen et al. coassembled 
catalase and human serum albumin (HSA) which is formerly attached with PS Ce6 and then 
conjugated with anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) to generate HSACe6CatPTX for PTX 
induced intratumoral perfusion, hypoxia relieving combinational therapy 13. Yan et al. reported 
hypoxia 
relaxing 
UCNPs 
based 
system, 
UCNPs 
mSiO2Ce6
ketoglutarateGOxmMnO2HA for multimodal imaging guided cancer therapy where 
MnO2 produces O2 and acted as MRI contrast agent and also promoted Fentonlike agent. Here, 
authors claimed that the generated O2 enhanced PDT by relieving hypoxia.
