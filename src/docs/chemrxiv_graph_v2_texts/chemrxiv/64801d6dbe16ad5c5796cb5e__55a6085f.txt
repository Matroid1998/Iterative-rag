Description:
React with carboxylic acids in amidation to form amides.

Text:
The formation of the amide bond is of utmost importance in chemical synthesis. Amidebased 
compounds find their application in pharmaceuticals,1 agrochemicals,2 polymers,3 etc. For 
example, around a quarter of marketed drugs contain an amide bond,1 and amide coupling is 
the most prevalent chemical transformation in drug discovery.4 At the same time, academic 
and industrial researchers call for improvement in the sustainability of chemical processes that 

lead to amides as a top priority,5 in line with the principles of green chemistry and sustainable 
development.6 Among different strategies for the preparation of amides, the most 
straightforward is the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines (Figure 1). Their condensation 
using coupling reagents is the goto approach for the largescale preparation of amides.7 
However, such an approach suffers from considerable sustainability drawbacks.
