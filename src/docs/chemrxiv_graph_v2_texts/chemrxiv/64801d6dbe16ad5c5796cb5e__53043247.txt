Description:
Made more susceptible to nucleophilic attack when carboxylic acids are activated.

Text:
In the 
activation step, stoichiometric amounts of coupling reagents are used to activate the carboxylic 
acids, thus making the carbonyl group more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack from the 
amine molecules. Although highly efficient, this approach yields large amounts of solvent 
waste and poor atom economy. Alternatively, solutionbased direct catalysed amidation 
protocols with the frequently used boron810 and group (IV) metal catalysts1114 are more 
favourable from the green chemistry perspective. Yet, catalysed amidations still face a few 
challenges, for example, problems with catalyst loadings and recyclability as well as limited 
substrate scopes, not to mention that such reactions remain developed in solution, which does 
not help to reduce waste production.15
