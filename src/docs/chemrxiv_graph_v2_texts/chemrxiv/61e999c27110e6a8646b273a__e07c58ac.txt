Description:
A major source of plastic products known for its high durability, easy processability, and hydrolytic stability.

Text:
Plastic waste has become a global environmental concern, 
with more than 300 million tons of petroleumbased syn
thetic plastics industrially produced worldwide every year. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the major sources of plastic prod
ucts in the world. Due to its high durability, easy processa
bility and hydrolytic stability, PS is widely used in packag
ing, insulation, building and food processing industries 
and thus has become a major pollutant of soils, rivers, 
lakes, and oceans.1 
The most common chemical approach to recycle polysty
rene waste is thermal or thermocatalytic decomposition 
that leads either to fuellike products2 or to closeloop re
cycling through the recovery of styrene monomer3.

Description:
A plastic that can be biodegraded by microorganisms into low molecular organics or mineralized to CO2.

An
other route of recycling for PS, particularly suited for 
foams, proceeds through the dissolution of waste4 in sol
vents5 (including terpenics such as limonene) followed by 
recovery in supercritical CO2. Biodegradation of plastic 
waste, including that of PS, has been studied since the 
1960s. Researchers have attempted to use mixed microbial 
cultures and have isolated bacteria from various sources 
such as soil, garbage or sewage sludge to biodegrade vari
ous plastics into low molecular organics or mineralize to 
CO2. The ability of microorganisms to use polystyrene as a 
carbon source has been recently established.68 However, 
the high molar mass of commercial PS severely limits the 
efficiency of these enzymatic reactions.
