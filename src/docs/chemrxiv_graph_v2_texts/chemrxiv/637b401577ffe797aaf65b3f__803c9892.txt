Description:
Compounds oxidized by tyrosinase.

Text:
Human tyrosinase (hsTYR, EC 1.14.18.1) is a type3 coppercontaining metalloenzyme char
acterized by a coupled binuclear active site that performs both the orthohydroxylation of 
monophenols and the oxidation of catechols.1 Especially, hsTYR carries out the hydroxylation 
of Ltyrosine to LDOPA and the subsequent oxidation of LDOPA to dopaquinone, thereby 
initiating the spontaneous synthesis of melanin pigments in specialized skin cells, i.e. the mel
anocytes.2 Melanin plays a crucial role in cell protection against UV radiations and free radicals. Nonetheless, the production of these pigments, i.e.
