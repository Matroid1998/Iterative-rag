Nasuperionicconductor (NASICON) structured materials are considered as promising 
electrodes for sodiumion batteries because of their 3D openframework crystal structure, 
resulting in high cyclability and fast rate capability.15 Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3 has been 
extensively studied, showing satisfactory energy density and rate performance as well as 
good thermal stability.613 The crystal structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 is composed of repeating 
units called lanterns, into which two VO6 octahedra are joined together through three 
cornersharing PO4 tetrahedra. Within the 3D framework generated by these lanterns, two 
crystallographic sodium sites, labeled Na(1) and Na(2), are usually reported. The Na(1) site is 
located between the lantern units along the 001hexagonal direction and is surrounded by six 
oxygen atoms in its first coordination sphere and by six Na(2) atoms in its second one.
