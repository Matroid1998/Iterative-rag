Description:
The simplest representative of arynes, known for its highly reactive and short-lived nature.

Text:
Arynes are highly reactive, shortlived intermediates that can 
undergo a variety of chemical transformations.1 The simplest 
representative is 1,2didehydrobenzene also known as benzyne 
(figure 1). The central structural motif of arynes is a bent triple
bond that is part of a strained aromatic (poly)cycle.2,3 This 
special bonding situation results in a lowenergy LUMO,4 
leading to significant electrophilic reactivity.5 Consequently, 
arynes are captured efficiently by arynophiles in diverse 
reactions, like nucleophilic additions, pericyclic reactions, 
insertions or multicomponent processes.6 Due to this broad 
applicability, arynebased transformations are a powerful toolbox 
in chemical synthesis, underlined by their use in complex 
synthetic sequences towards natural products.7,8

commonly generated in situ from stable precursors.
