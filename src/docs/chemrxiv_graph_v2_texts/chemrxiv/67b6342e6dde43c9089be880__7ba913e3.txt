The reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, also known as the reductive citric acid cycle, is an 
30 
important metabolic pathway found in several anaerobic bacteria and archaea to fix carbon 
31 
dioxide.1 This cycle has been proposed as a possible prebiotic pathway for uncatalyzed carbon 
32 
fixation, owing to both its simplicity and its presence in phylogenetically ancient organisms.25 
33 
However, evolutionary history makes it challenging to infer prebiotic chemical pathways from 
34 
modern biochemical processes, as these pathways may have been substantially changed. 35 
Consequently, prebiotic chemistry may have been fundamentally distinct from the biochemistry 
36 
observed in extant organisms.6 While the rTCA cycle offers a plausible route for early autotrophic 
37 
metabolism, its prebiotic role remains unclear.
