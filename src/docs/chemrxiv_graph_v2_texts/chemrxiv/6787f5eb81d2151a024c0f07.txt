Description:
Emitted at significantly higher levels by medium and heavy-duty truck traffic compared to light-duty vehicles.

Text:
Recent research has focused on the contributions of medium and heavyduty truck traffic, which 
emit significantly higher levels of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) than light
duty vehicles (Anenberg et al., 2017; Dallmann et al., 2013; Haugen and Bishop, 2018; Xiang et 
al., 2019, 2018). These dieselpowered vehicles are a major source of TRAP emissions, even 
though they make up a smaller proportion of the U.S. vehicle fleet by distance traveled. Despite 
their smaller numbers, medium and heavyduty trucks are responsible for a disproportionate 
amount of pollution, which contributes to exposure disparities among racial, ethnic, and 
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (Demetillo et al., 2021, 2020; Tessum et al., 2021).
