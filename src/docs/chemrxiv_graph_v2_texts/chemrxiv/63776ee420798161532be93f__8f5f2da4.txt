Description:
Present in the C2 cut during the acetylene removal process.

Text:
Ethylene is one of the most important bulk platform chemicals with 
an annual global production of 214 million tons in 2021.1 The 
industrially established primary production method is steam 
cracking of hydrocarbon feedstock, followed by separation and 
purification.23 In the C2 product stream after the deethanizer 
column it is necessary to reduce the acetylene content down to 
below 1 ppmv on the industrial scale by selective hydrogenation 
to ethylene.34 Such an acetylene removal unit (ARU) can be 
integrated directly after the deethanizer, where the C2cut 
contains excess hydrogen and methane (frontend) or after the 
subsequent demethanizer (tailend).2, 56 Currently the tailend 
process is more commonly applied as reaction control is more 
convenient due to control of the hydrogenacetylene ratio.
