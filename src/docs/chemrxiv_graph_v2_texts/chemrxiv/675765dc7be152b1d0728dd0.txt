Description:
A catecholamine neurotransmitter that binds and activates dopamine receptors, a family of G protein-coupled receptors.

Text:
The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) signals by binding and activating dopamine 
receptors (DRs), a family of G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs). DRs are subcategorized on the 
basis of signaling and sequence homology into the excitatory D1like receptors, which includes 
dopamine D1 and D5 receptors (D1R, D5R), and the inhibitory D2like receptors, which includes 
dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors (D2R, D3R, and D4R).1 All D2like receptors share a similar 
signaling mechanism, coupling to the Gio G proteins and recruiting arrestin.2 They also share 
substantial amino acid sequence homology in their orthosteric binding sites.
