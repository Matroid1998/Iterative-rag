Description:
Forms nanoonion structures when annealed.

This was 
attributed to evolution of the NPs to have surface layers with fullycoordinated, nanoonion 
(fullerenelike) structures, which are known to form when carbon NPs are annealed.1114 
Experiments with carbon nanoonion NPs found, as expected, that some were initially inert to 
O2, while others had nonzero initial reactivity due to contamination by nononion carbon, but 
passivated rapidly as this contamination etched away. O2 attack at defects in graphite basal planes results in etching at increasing rates as carbon 
removal enlarges the defects into etch pits.59 Thus, we might expect that NPs with passivated
