Description:
A toxic metabolite formed from 3methyl indole by CYP450 enzymes in pulmonary cells.

Text:
In feedlot cattle being fed a high 
grain diet 3methyl indole has been targeted as the 
causative agent of feedlot AIP, but past research has 
demonstrated inconsistent results5,6. The amount of l
tryptophan in high grain diets may not be high enough 
to create enough 3MI to be toxic, leading the field to 
consider the cause of feedlot AIP to be multifactorial7. The formation of 3MI toxic metabolites in 
pulmonary cells that leads to AIP is due to intracellular 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes metabolizing 3
MI to 3methyleneindoline (3MEIN). Pulmonary 
pneumocyte 
CYP450 
enzymes 
can 
catalyze 
metabolism of other substrates, one of which is ethyl 
carbamate8. The metabolism of ethyl carbamate in 
pulmonary cells by CYP450 enzymes produces its 
toxic metabolites9. Its pathogenesis is very similar to 
3MI toxicity8.
