Microalgal technologies can advance the limit of technology for tertiary nutrient recovery at water 
59 
resource recovery facilities (WRRFs; a.k.a. wastewater treatment plants, WWTPs), while also 
60 
producing valuable coproducts, such as fertilizers, bioenergy feedstocks, industrial chemicals, 
61 
and animal feed.1,2 Recently, these technologies have attracted attention because of their 
62 
potential to meet effluent total phosphorus limits as low as 0.03 mgPL1,3 well below the current 
63 
limit of technology for biological phosphorus removal (0.3 mgPL1).4 Despite the potential of 
64 
microalgaebased wastewater treatment as an alternative to conventional chemotrophic nutrient 
65 
removal andor chemical precipitation, the lack of a reliable and reproducible model to predict and 
66 
optimize the performance of microalgal nutrient recovery process design has limited the 
67 
widespread use of this technology.
