Description:
React with bicyclo1.1.0butanes in formal (31) cycloaddition to produce halogenated bicyclo1.1.1pentanes.

Therefore, the development of novel strategies for the synthesis of bicyclon.1.1alkanes 
would not only enrich the toolkit of synthetic chemists but also greatly enlarge the compound 
library accessible for drug discovery. Cycloaddition reactions are among the most important tools in organic chemistry. In particular, 
the formal (n3) cycloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs)2028 has recently become a 
particularly valuable strategy for the rapid construction of saturated bicyclon.1.1alkanes 
(Scheme 1C). The formal (31) cycloaddition of BCBs with dihalocarbenes was first reported by 
Applequist in 197729 and further developed by Mykhailiuk,30 Ma31 and Anderson,32 respectively, 
providing a route to various halogenated bicyclo1.1.1pentanes.
