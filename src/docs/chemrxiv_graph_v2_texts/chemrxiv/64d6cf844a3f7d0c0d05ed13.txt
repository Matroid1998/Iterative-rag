Description:
Used as an electrode material in electroformation of lipid films.

GUVs (giant unilamellar vesicles) are a commonly used 
model system to probe lipid phase behavior14, membrane
protein interactions510, and to encapsulate cellular machinery11
14. GUVs are an attractive model systems not only due to their 
large size (typically 10 to 20 m in diameter), which allows for 
convenient imaging via optical microscopy1518, but also due to 
their ease of production. GUVs are commonly produced by either gentle hydration or 
electroformation. Although both methods start with a lipid 
mixture dried as a film, for gentle hydration the film is dried 
onto glass, while for electroformation the film is dried onto 
either platinum electrodes or iridium tin oxide slides19.
