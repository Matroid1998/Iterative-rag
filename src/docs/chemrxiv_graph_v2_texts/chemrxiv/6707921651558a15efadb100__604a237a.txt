Involved in atom migration and insertion on aromatic rings.

of electronwithdrawing groups. This 
approach is applicable to various substrates such as indole, imidazole, indene, and cyclopentadiene, resulting in the desired carbon
inserted products. Insights from insitu spectroscopy and theoretical calculations suggest the involvement of distonic radical cation 
intermediates, facilitating carbonatom migration on the aromatic ring and enabling insertion at different positions. This study expands 
the chemical toolkit for synthesizing polysubstituted (hetero)aromatic compounds and introduces a new concept for singlecarbon 
insertion chemistry. Introduction 
Polysubstituted (hetero)aromatic compounds play a crucial 
role in diverse fields, particularly in pharmaceuticals.18 Ap
proved drugs such as Netupitant, Esomeprazole, Pyridoxine, 
and Opicapone contain benzene and pyridine rings with more 
than three substituents (Figure 1A).

Description:
An element that can be inserted into the metaposition of a nitrogen atom in ring expansion reactions.

Text:
For 
instance, ring expansion of pyrrole to pyridine is solely reported 
for metainsertion, where a carbon atom is inserted into the 
metaposition of a nitrogen atom.1822 Levin and coworkers
