Description:
A framework that remains unreactive to certain oxidants under specific conditions.

Text:
Further Cu deintercalation attempted 
at above 0 C or using stronger oxidants such as Br2 and NO2BF415 led to overall 
decomposition, so to circumvent such limitations, oxidants must be chemoselective 
toward removal of Cu while unreactive to the rest of the oxychalcogenide framework 
under the reaction conditions. Synthetic intermediates may circumvent large activation 
barriers, which are often encountered during topochemical anion redox. For example,
