Hybrid materials elaborations and
characterizations allow also the detection and quantification of organic compound in our food products, to limit
our exposure in some diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and so fourth 5,6. In fact, in the past few decades,
many engineering routes have been suggested and and thoroughly discussed in order to find superb materials for
considerable technological applications. So that, these ways include  the exploration of metal oxides materials
such Alumina, ceria, silica,Manganese oxides 7,9, they can be used as a matrix of metallic nanoparticles or as
an active catalyst. The development and characterization of many forms of carbons such as nanotubes,
nanofibers, polymers, heteroatomsincorporated carbons, black carbons, and so on, have severely discussed to
boost the performance of composite materials 10,14.

Furthermore, in 2019, a review discussed on the use of rare earth elements
with transition metalbased materials for ecatalysts design, synthesis, and applications were exhaustively
analyzed in Gaos research work 22. It shows that these rare earth metals could be used for materials
engineering for hightech applications as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), methanol oxidation reaction
(MOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Many benefits and challenges
of hybrid materials made via the use of rare earth elements are considered in the study. An alumina (Al2O3)
supported nickel catalysts (NiAl2O3) modified by rare earth elements was demonstrated as a highly active
catalyst for the decomposition of NH3 as described in Okuras paper 23.
