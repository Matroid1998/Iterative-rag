Description:
Used as partially digested mixtures in lipid-based drug delivery systems.

Studies of butamben 
encapsulated in lipid DDS such as liposomes and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) 
(Cereda et al., 2013; Maestrelli et al., 2010; Mura et al., 2021; Rodrigues da Silva et al., 
2021) showed that BTB could be an interesting model for miscibility studies. NLC are promising DDS to API of low aqueous solubility (i.e. BCS classes II and 
IV). The NLC core is composed by a mixture of solid and liquid lipids that retains solid 
features at room temperature. The most used NLClipid excipients are triglycerides, 
mixtures of partially digested glycerides, fatty acids, and typical pharmaceutical waxes. These excipients also help to decrease the toxicity in this kind of formulation since they 
present the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status. (Williams et al., 2013).
