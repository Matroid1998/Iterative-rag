Description:
Used in the synthesis of InP quantum dots to generate the core.

Text:
The development of colloidal quantum dot (QD) syntheses has allowed for control over 
their attractive optoelectronic properties. Many of these synthetic methods begin empirically 
with a limited understanding of the underlying nucleation and growth mechanisms. InP QDs 
have emerged as a commercially relevant, emissive material and as such their formation 
pathways have been the subject of deep investigation. Today, the stateoftheart method for 
producing InP QDs involves the combination of indium carboxylates (In(O2CR)3) and 
tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine (P(SiMe3)3) to generate the core QDs before shelling with ZnS and 
ZnSe.1,2 While InP QD synthesis has been optimized to the point of commercial production, one 
of the characteristics that still hinders progress on color purity is the monodispersity of the InP 
cores.
