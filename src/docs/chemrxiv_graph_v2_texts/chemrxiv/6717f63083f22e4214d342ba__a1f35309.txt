Description:
A component of a thermo-responsive block copolymer used for reversible sol-gel transitions.

Recently, Pappa and coworkers reported an example of 
crosslinkerfree gelation using a mixture of chitosan, gelatin, and PEDOTPSS.16 However, these 
blends are liquid at physiological temperature which limits their applicability in in vivo and in 
vitro bioelectronics. Here, we achieved a reversible solgel transition in conductive polymers just below physiological 
temperature (35 C) through a fundamentally different approach that does not rely on covalent 
crosslinkers nor composite blends. The key molecular design was the synthesis of a thermo
responsive block copolymer of PSS with poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PSSbPNIPAM) that was 
then used as a matrix to prepare PEDOTPSSbPNIPAM polyelectrolyte complexes (Fig. 1a).
