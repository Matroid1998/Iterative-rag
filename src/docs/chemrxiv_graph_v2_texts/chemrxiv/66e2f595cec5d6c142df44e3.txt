Description:
Involved in the creation of vacancies that can modify catalyst properties.

Text:
These include steps, edges, dislocations as well
as the chemical modification of catalysts via the creation
of oxygen vacancies or cations substitution.812
Cation substitution in Co3O4 catalysts has been
found, in favorable cases, benficial for oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) and alcohol oxidation. It can lower the
binding energy of water molecules and intermediates
onto active sites, increase the electrical conductivity
by promoting charge transfer among the heteroatoms
and consequently improve the OER performance10. In Ref.12 the authors used cation doping and oxygen
vacancies to engineer the electronic states of ultrathin
Co3O4 (001) nanosheets for OER.
