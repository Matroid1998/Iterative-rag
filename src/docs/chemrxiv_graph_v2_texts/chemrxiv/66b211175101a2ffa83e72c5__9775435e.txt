Description:
A compound that is half as hard as diamond but exhibits much higher thermal and chemical stability.

Text:
In the case of the nearest neighbors of carbon, boron and nitrogen, equiatomic 
cubic boron nitride (cBN) has been synthesized, which is half as hard as diamond but exhibits 
much higher thermal and chemical stability 3. Research efforts to identify new superhard phases of compounds of light elements require the 
use of structure prediction programs such as USPEX 4 and CALYPSO 5. However, novel 
structures can also be identified through the application of crystal engineering rationale as 
presented here. In all cases, such predictions must be validated by the quantitative study of 
energies and the derived physical properties using firstprinciples calculations. Over the years, 
the wellestablished quantum mechanics framework of the density functional theory (DFT) 6,7 
has proven to be the most efficient.

Description:
An equiatomic compound.

Text:
The present paper further develops the field of boron nitrides by proposing novel cohesive and 
stable hybrid BN phases. First, tetragonal and hexagonal sp3sp2 hybrid C5 allotropes were 
designed by crystal chemistry engineering and subsequently used as templates for the selective 
substitution of carbon for boron and nitrogen, leading to the sesquinitride B2N3, which was then 
transformed into the equiatomic B3N3 through the insertion of an additional boron atom into 
B2N3. Considering that boron nitride is admittedly equiatomic, our challenging prediction of boron 
sesquinitride is supported to some extent by the previously reported nitrogenexcess tetragonal 
B2N3 8, but no structural details were provided for this compound. The boron nitride B116N124 
fullerene should also be mentioned as nitrogenrich BN phase 9.
