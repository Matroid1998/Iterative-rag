Copper ions exchanged onto Alsubstituted zeolites facil
itate various oxidation reactions and redox cycles, including 
NO decomposition,12 CO oxidation,34 NOx (x  1,2) selective 
catalytic reduction using NH3,59 and the partial oxidation of 
CH4 to form CH3OH in stoichiometric1017 and catalytic1819 
cycles.
