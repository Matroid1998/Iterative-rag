Description:
Known for high catalytic activity at lower temperatures in CO2 methanation.

The reduction of CO2 by H2 is an important step within the powertogas (P2G) concept 1, 
which is crucial for the chemical storage of renewable energy with an ultimate goal to 
compensate for the fluctuating production of wind and solar power 2. Ru based catalysts have 
attracted particular interest because of their high catalytic activity already at lower temperature 
( 190 C) 35. Among the different support materials, Al2O3 appeared to be less attractive 
because of the lower catalytic activity of RuAl2O3 catalysts compared to Ru catalysts 
supported on other materials such as CeO2, MgO, SiO2, and TiO2 68. The interest in the 
RuAl2O3 catalyzed CO2 methanation reaction increased, however, recently, when Chen et al.
