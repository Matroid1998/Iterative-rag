Description:
A highly symmetric compound with strong CH bonds (434 kJ mol1) that emits CO2 upon degradation.

It is important to design green reactions that pro
vide sustainable energy, cleaner environment and lesser 
emission of greenhouse gases in the coming future. The 
global reliance on nonrenewable sources of energy has 
contributed to the growing environmental and climate 
challenges. Solardriven energy generation through 
heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a sustainable 
solution to these challenges.15 Photocatalytic coupling 
of methane to ethane by using solar energy at room 
temperature is a promising approach for conversion of 
methane (CH4) to ethane (C2H6). The thermo catalytic degradation of sp3 hybridized 
highly 
symmetric 
CH4 
with 
strong 
CH 
bonds 
(434 kJ mol1) requires very high temperature and also 
low selectivity in products and CO2 emission.

Description:
A compound involved in CH activation and nonoxidative coupling to form higher hydrocarbons.

Text:
The pri
mary challenge in photo catalysis is to design catalysts 
that can efficiently utilize visible light in solar spectrum 
and to reduce insufficient selectivity and increase the 
yield of the desired product ethane and reduce unde
sired products like CO2. There has been an intense in
terest to find a green reaction for CH activation of CH4. The nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) to higher 
hydrocarbons is one way for breaking the CH bond in 
CH4.6 The transition metal nano clusters (Ti, W, Mo, Fe, 
Ni, etc.) act as robust catalysts of the activation of CH 
bonds.710 
Metal nano clusters are extremely small particles, 1 to 10 
nanometers in size, and are composed of atoms of a 
single metal element (monometal) or multiple ele
ments (alloys).
