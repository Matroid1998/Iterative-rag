Description:
A potential n-type material for thermoelectric devices, derived from BiCuSeO with missing Cu.

Text:
It would be ideal to use the same material
as the p and ntype legs to avoid device failure due to different
coefficients of thermal expansion and other issues. While ptype
BiCuSeO exhibits relatively high TE performance, it is challenging
to obtain ntype BiCuSeO.9 Attempts to dope BiCuSeO ntype with
halogens,1012 and transition metals,8,13 have resulted in either
low power factors andor anomalous pnp transitions in the con
ductivity type with T. Therefore, an alternative ntype material is
needed to pair with ptype BiCuSeO in a TE device. Bi2SeO2 has emerged as a potential ntype material to pair with
ptype BiCuSeO in TE devices. The crystal structure of Bi2SeO2
can be thought of as BiCuSeOderived with missing Cu.

Description:
An electron concentration-optimized compound used in devices.

Text:
Although the electron concentration
in Bi2SeO2 in the aforementioned device was optimized through
a mechanical shear exfoliation method,15 other routes have also
been adopted. Substituting Bi with Sb16 and La,17 Ge,18,19 Sn,20
Ti,21 Ce,22 Nb23,24 and Ta,25 has been successful to various de
grees, either due to an increase in the electron concentration,
change in the effective mass, or a combination of both. Substi
tuting Se or O with S,26 Te,27,28 and Cl29 has increased zT com
pared to selfdoped Bi2SeO2. The highest zT of 0.69 at 773 K
was achieved by Te substitution obtained through a mechanical
shear exfoliation technique,15,28 which was claimed to increase
the concentration of donorlike Se vacancies (VSe) leading to a
sixfold enhancement in the power factor.

Description:
A compound whose electron concentration affects its thermoelectric performance.

Text:
Bi2SeO2 synthesis typically involves a solid
state reaction step, where one procedure uses a twostep method
with different reaction temperatures and holding times,18,25,31
while another uses a single solidstate reaction step at a fixed
temperature.26 A fundamental question arises are these differ
ent synthesis procedures responsible for the wide variations in
the reported electron concentrations and therefore, the TE per
formance of Bi2SeO2? For practical purposes, how do we sys
tematically tune the electron concentration and improve the TE
