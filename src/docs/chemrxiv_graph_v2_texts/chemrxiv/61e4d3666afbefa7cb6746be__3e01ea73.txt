Description:
Proinflammatory mediators produced during inflammation.

Text:
Inflammation is a physiologic response of the body to eliminate unwanted antigens and 
prevent further tissue damage (Hung and Suzuki, 2017). However, insufficient or excessive 
inflammatory response can be pathologic (Biswas and Bagchi, 2016; Fujiwara and Kobayashi, 
2005; Hung and Suzuki, 2017). In a bacteriainduced infection, inflammation is mediated by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that acts as an antigen triggering the immune system to activate 
macrophages and lymphocytes to produce proinflammatory mediators (prostaglandins and nitric 
oxide) and cytokines (TNFa, IL1, IL2, IL6, IL8 and IL12) (Fujiwara and Kobayashi, 2005; 
Hung and Suzuki, 2017; Liu et al., 2017). At the molecular level, these processes are regulated by 
the proinflammatory molecule NFB which can either be a homodimer or heterodimer with p50, 
p52 or p65 subunits.
