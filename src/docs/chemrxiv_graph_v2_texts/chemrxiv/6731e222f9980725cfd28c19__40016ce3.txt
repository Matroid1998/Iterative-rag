Description:
Used as a ligand in the synthesis of Pt nanoclusters with atomic precision.

Text:
The synthesis of 1nmsized Pt nanoclusters (Pt NCs) and their 
alloy NCs has garnered significant interest owing to their unique 
properties and potential applications in catalysis. Using carbon 
monoxide (CO) ligands,1,2 Pt NCs (Ptn(CO)m NCs; where n and m are 
the numbers of Pt atoms and CO ligands, respectively) can be 
synthesized with atomic precision.36 Most such NCs are not stable 
under atmospheric conditions, and thus few studies have been 
conducted on their application.
