Description:
A component in calcium-containing biominerals studied using potentiometry.

Numerous analytical approaches have been used to characterize these species, as cryoTEM 
approaches,35,9 SAXS,9,10 monitoring the evolution of calcium potentiometry (for calciumcontaining 
biominerals),4,6,1113 DLS,9 ultracentrifugation,6 computational studies11,14,15 and by electron ionization 
mass spectrometry.16 Despite the number of methodologies used to study these species, there is still 
a lack of information available in terms of composition, structural arrangement, and kinetic evolution, 
necessitating the development of innovative timeresolved monitoring techniques. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a very powerful technique in studying the 
structure and dynamics at the atomic and molecular level of liquid or solid matter.17 Thus, NMR 
spectroscopy can potentially provide precious insights into the various transient species formed during 
the nucleation and crystallization processes.
