Description:
Complexes of osmium used in dye-sensitized solar cells, biological probes, and binuclear complexes.

Text:
Polypyridyl 
complexes 
of 
osmium 
were 
first 
synthesized and characterized in the 1940s and 50s,6 and 
have since been studied in various applications including dye
sensitized solar cells,7 as biological probes,8 and binuclear 
complexes.9 Previously, our group developed several osmium
based photocatalysts and demonstrated their competency at 
carrying out various transformations with NIR irradiation.4 As 
the ability of these chromophores to achieve reactivity 
previously only accomplished with nearUV or visible light has 
now been established, our next goal is to develop a library of 
catalysts with a wide range of electrochemical properties in 
order to facilitate the adoption of NIR photoredox catalysis to a 
broader scope of reactions.
