Description:
An alloy catalyst with excellent catalytic feature for complete degradation of hydrous hydrazine.

Text:
These NiM (M  noble metals) revealed
to be excellent hydrazine conversion catalysts for H2 release, but their cost and Poisoning by harmful spices
hindered their application. This is why the search of new routes are on the way of scientific research fields. So,
in this sense, Noblemetalfree bimetallic nanoparticles especially NiFe alloy catalysts have displayed excellent
catalytic feature for complete degradation of hydrous hydrazine, the NiFe alloy with equimolar composition
exhibited the highest selectivity (100) of hydrogen production in 0.5 M of sodium hydroxide at 343 K as
reported by the above Author 26. A minireview paper has been established by Rai,R et al 27 which
demonstrated the alternative use of the activated bimetallic nanostructures catalysts for specific CC coupling
reactions.
