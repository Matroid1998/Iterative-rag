Description:
A halogenated uracil radiosensitizer investigated using extreme ultraviolet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy.

Text:
In this study, we investigate the photorelaxation dynamics of 5bromouracil and 5bromo2
deoxyuridine (BrU and BrUrd, Scheme 1), two prototypical halogenated uracil radiosensitizers, in aqueous 
solution by means of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) timeresolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Previous 
theoretical investigations on gasphase BrU proposed that UV photoexcitation to the first bright 1 state 
is followed primarily by rapid decay to the electronic ground state (S0) through a 1S0 conical intersection 
(CI).15, 16 Alternatively, CBr dissociation via nonadiabatic coupling to the optically dark 1 state is 
feasible.
