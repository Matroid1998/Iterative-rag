of alternate leaving 
groups were also explored. Methoxyderivative 4, prepared in 
3 steps from commercial materials, exhibited a comparable 
stability profile relative to 3. Finally, introduction of bromine 
(5) proved beneficial, resulting in the most stable of all sub
strates prepared. The DA reactivities of furans 15 were benchmarked in 
PhMe using Nmethylmaleimide (NMM) as dienophile
