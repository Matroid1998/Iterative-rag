Description:
A coenzyme required by enzymes to catalyze the cleavage and formation of bonds adjacent to the carbonyl group of the acyldonor substrate.

Text:
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)dependent enzymes encompass a diverse range of catalytic activities 
but they all require the coenzyme TPP as its ylide 1 to catalyse the cleavage and formation of bonds 
adjacent to the carbonyl group of the acyldonor substrate.
