Description:
Subject to aerobic oxidation catalyzed by gold compounds like AuCl3.

Text:
Beyond a few cases where homogeneous catalysis by gold, 
originating from AuCl3 and anionic ligands, is used for the aerobic 
oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the systems that have been most 
thoroughly examined are those that employ heterogeneous 
methods involving gold nanoparticles.1,5,14,15 Both monometallic 
and bimetallic nanoparticles, particularly AuPd 4,5,16 on oxide 
supports, have been identified as exceptionally effective.1,5,8,17 
While goldbased catalysts are versatile in facilitating a range of 
oxidative6,7,1822 and reductive23,24 reactions, their application in 
both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis presents 
significant limitations.
