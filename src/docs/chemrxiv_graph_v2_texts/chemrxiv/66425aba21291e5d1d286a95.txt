Description:
Natural compounds with diverse structures and biological activities.

Text:
A variety of RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post
translationally modified peptides) have been isolated in re
cent years due to their ability to quickly and accurately pre
dict chemical structures from genomic sequences, making 
them more accessible for prediction than natural com
pounds such as terpenes and alkaloids.1 These RiPPs, syn
thesized by ribosomes and subsequently generated by di
verse tailoring enzymes, exhibit intriguing structures and bi
ological activities.
