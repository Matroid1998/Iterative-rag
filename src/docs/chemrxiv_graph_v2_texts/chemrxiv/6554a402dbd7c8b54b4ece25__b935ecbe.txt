Description:
Known as adenine, does not have a strong fluorescence signature in aqueous solution.

Text:
guanine(13) and isoguanine(14)) may be more photostable
than the homosubstituted purines (2,6diaminopurine and xanthine(15, 16)), while purines
with a single ligand (adenine,(17) 2AP,(18) 2oxopurine,(19) and hypoxanthine(20)) appear
to be more photostable than most purines with two ligands. (13) MartinezFernandez et al. in a thorough computational study on the photostability effects of position and oxoamino
substitution for purines with a single ligand,(19) found that amino or oxo substitution at C2
has little effect on the photodynamics, while C6 functionalization leads to photostability. However, these general trends do not include details, such as the role of the solvent. A wellknown example of this structure dependence is the difference between
adenine (6aminopurine), and its isomer 2aminopurine (2AP). 2AP has a strong
fluorescence signature in aqueous solution, while adenine does not.
