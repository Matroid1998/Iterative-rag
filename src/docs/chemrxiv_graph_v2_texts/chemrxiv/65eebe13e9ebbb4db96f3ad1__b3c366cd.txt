Description:
Limited by scarcity, affecting the widespread and large-scale implementation of PEMWE.

Text:
Although alternative materials such as ruthenium can show superior OER activity in acidic media compared to iridium, the higher dissolution 
rate of Ru under PEMWE conditions strongly constrains its longterm stability.2,3 However, the scarcity of iridium still limits the widespread 
and largescale implementation of PEMWE.4,5 
A scaleup of the annual implementation of PEMWE to 10 GW using stateoftheart electrolyzers with loadings of 2 mgIr cm2, would require 
7.5 t of iridium,5 whereas the global iridium supply in 2022 only amounted to 6.8 t per year.6 Calculations considering the scarcity of iridium 
and the projected scaleup to the GWscale reveal that an iridiumspecific power density of 50  100 kW gIr1 is required for a successful 
adoption of PEMWE.79 The iridiumspecific power density in recent publications ranges between 9  16 kW gIr1.5,8,10 Thus, the iridium 
utilization must be ultimately enhanced for a future scaleup of PEMWE.

Description:
Used in electrodes with reduced loadings to maintain high PEMWE performance.

Text:
This is only achievable by designing electrodes with strongly reduced 
iridium loadings while simultaneously maintaining a high PEMWE performance. Decreasing the loading, however, usually involves a reduction of catalyst layer thickness. Importantly, it was shown that below a certain 
threshold of layer thickness or loading (e.g., for Umicore Elyst Ir75 0480  2 m or  0.5 mgIr cm2),8 the structural integrity and, thus, the 
inplane electrical connectivity within the layer is disrupted. Additionally, cracks can form during operation in these thin catalyst layers. In 
combination with the comparably large pore size of the porous transport layers (PTLs), these cracks result in disconnected and therefore 
inactive catalyst islands.

Description:
Used in catalyst powders, often alloyed with more abundant elements to reduce content.

Text:
This decreased catalyst utilization comes along with significant performance losses.1012 
To overcome the problems associated with too thin catalyst layers, the iridium content in the catalyst powder should be decreased to enable 
the fabrication of sufficiently thick catalyst layers with low iridium loadings. In other words, advanced electrode architectures require a high 
electrode thickness factor, which per definition is the electrode thickness as a function of catalyst loading. 1,8,13 
Common strategies to reduce the iridium content in the catalyst powder are either to alloy iridium with more abundant elements or to 
support the iridium. Alloying has been shown with many different elements, such as Fe14, Cr15, and Ni14,16.

Description:
Used in catalysts with high dispersion to increase reaction sites for the OER.

Text:
However, the low dissolution 
stability of the alloying elements is a concern considering both catalyst durability and membrane poisoning.17 Using support materials for 
iridium catalysts instead can introduce a high dispersion of the iridium phase, thus increasing the amount of reaction sites. However, the 
electrical connection of the iridium sites must be ensured to render them active for the OER. To achieve this, several conductive supports 
have been tested, for example antimonydoped tin oxide (ATO)18 and tantalumdoped TiO219 showing high conductivity. But once more, the 
dissolution stability of these materials is questionable; illustratively, a high antimony dissolution from ATO has been shown in threeelectrode 
electrochemical tests.20 
To avoid support degradation, TiO2 is established as a stable support, both in academic research13,2125 and industry.

Description:
Used in catalysts where its phase ensures conductivity in TiO2 supported systems.

Text:
Nevertheless, the 
electrical conductivity of TiO2 is so low that it is regarded as insulator for the application in PEMWE.22 Therefore, the conductivity of TiO2
supported iridium catalysts must be ensured solely by the iridium phase. To guarantee a percolating pathway from particle to particle, a 
coreshell structure is usually aimed for.13,21,2426 
Here, a delicate balance must be found between reducing the iridium content on the one hand and achieving sufficient conductivity on the 
other hand. Generally, to ultimately decrease the iridium content, an iridium shell as thin as possible is desirable, which, however, reduces 
the electric conductivity.

Description:
Used in photodeposition to produce coreshell particles.

Text:
Additionally, choosing support particles with a low specific surface area can decrease the required amount of 
iridium, because less surface needs to be covered for a closed shell, as pointed out by Bernt et al.13 
In this regard, photodeposition is a suitable method to produce coreshell particles. During photodeposition synthesis, a mixture of 
semiconducting particles (e.g., TiO2) and metal ions (e.g., IrX) is exposed to electromagnetic radiation with an energy exceeding the band
