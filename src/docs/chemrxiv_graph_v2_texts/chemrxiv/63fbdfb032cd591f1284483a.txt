Abstract Microorganisms still remain as main hotspots in the global drug discovery avenue. 39 
In particular, fungi are highly prolific producers of a vast of structurally divers specialised 
40 
secondary metabolites, which have displayed a myriad of biomedical potentialities. 41 
Intriguingly, isocoumarins is one distinctive class of fungal natural products polyketides, which 
42 
demonstrated numerous remarkable biological and pharmacological activities. This review 
43 
article provides a comprehensive state of the art over the period 20002022 about the discovery, 
44 
isolation, classifications, and therapeutic potentialities of isocoumarins exclusively reported 
45 
from fungi.

Description:
Structurally diverse compounds documented from various fungal sources.

Text:
Indeed, a comprehensive list of 351 structurally diverse isocoumarins were 
46 
documented, classified according to their fungal sources 16 order 28 family 55 genera where 
47 
they have been originally discovered, alongside, their reported pharmacological activities 
48 
wherever applicable. Also, recent insights around their proposed and experimentally proven 
49 
biosynthetic pathways are also briefly discussed. 50
