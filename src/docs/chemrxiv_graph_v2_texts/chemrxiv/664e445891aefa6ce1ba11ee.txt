Description:
Produced from sugarcane, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions when waste bagasse is burned for energy.

Text:
In 2018, global sugarcane production reached 1.91 billion tonnes, with Brazil, India, China, and 
Thailand leading in output (UN FAOSTAT, 2019). Each ton of sugarcane processed yields 260 kg of 
moist bagasse (130 kg of dry bagasse). The production of sugar and ethanol from sugarcane generates 
substantial waste bagasse, much of which is burned for energy, contributing to greenhouse gas 
emissions (Yaseen and Scholz, 2019). To mitigate environmental impact, it is crucial to explore 
sustainable alternatives for reusing this waste. One viable solution is utilizing sugarcane bagasse as an 
adsorbent for removing contaminants, such as dyes, from wastewater. The direct discharge of dyes 
poses significant threats to global water security (Tkaczyk et al., 2020). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20243v2m9 ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000240353794 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
