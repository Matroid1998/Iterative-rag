Description:
A model alkene used in temperature programmed desorption experiments.

Text:
In particular, carbon deposition (coking) under hydrocarbonrich conditions is a 
degradation mechanism that affects many catalysts, and for subnano clusters the high temperatures 
where coking tends to occur also are likely to drive sintering. The focus of this study is understanding 
the mechanisms by which Ge addition stabilizes subnano Pt clusters against both sintering and coking 
when the clusters are saturated by a model alkene (ethylene), and heated. We previously examined deactivation of subnano Ptnalumina (n  4,7,8) and Ptnsilica (n  
4,7) model catalysts by a combination of sintering and coking, during repeated ethylene temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) experiments.

Description:
Binds to cluster structures affecting their stability and fluxionality.

Text:
Density functional theory (DFT) with PBE functional11 
and PAW pseudopotentials12 was used to examine ethylene binding and its effects on cluster structure, 
stability, and fluxionality.13, 14 The clusters were found to deactivate rapidly, as shown by the loss of 
strong ethylene chemisorption sites, with effects from both carbon deposition and sintering. In addition, 
sintering was found to be sizedependent for Ptnalumina, with Pt4 and Pt7 showing enhanced (but still 
imperfect) stability at temperatures to 750 K, compared to neighboring cluster sizes.15 
In those experiments, sintering was inferred from changes in both numbers of exposed Pt
