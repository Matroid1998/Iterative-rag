Description:
Indispensable for all life forms and essential for efficient utilization in fertilizers.

Text:
Phosphorus (P) is indispensable for all life forms, and its efficient utilization in fertilizers is essential 
for sustaining a rapidly growing human population (Maci, 2005). The affinity of soil for P adsorption, 
alongside the capacity and strength of this process, significantly influences P immobilization. This 
significantly affects soil fertility and the fate of P in natural environments such as transfer from soil to 
freshwater systems, where P accelerates eutrophication (Ahmed et al., 2023; Andersen et al., 2015; 
Roy et al., 2017; Tisdale and Tisdale, 1993; Y. T. Wang et al., 2016).
