Description:
A compound utilized from industrial waste gases for conversion into valuable small molecules and base chemicals.

It still
remains an open challenge to build models that can general
ize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and con
gurations of adsorbates, and geometry crystalline surfaces. One of the most challenging tasks in catalyst discovery dur
ing the last ten years is the search for active and selective
electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R)
17. One of current emission reduction strategies such as
renewable energy sources, CO2 capture and storage (CCS)
is the utilization of CO2 from industrial waste gases. The
main pathways to utilize CO2 include reuse of it without
conversion (e.g. enhanced oil recovery, supercritical CO2 or
to convert the CO2 to a valuable small molecules and base
chemicals for continuous production of polymers and fuels.
