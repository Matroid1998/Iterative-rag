Description:
A transition metal catalyst important in chemical processes.

Text:
The tremendous advancements in organic chemistry 
and the success of the chemical science industries in the past 
century can be credited to catalysts based on transition metals 
such as palladium, platinum, cobalt, rhodium, gold, ruthenium, 
and rare earth metals. However, the past decade has also wit
nessed a renaissance in using cheap and abundant firstrow 
transition metals such as Ni, Cu, and Fe as catalysts in organic 
synthesis. Numerous academic and industrial processes now 
involve firstrow transition metals catalysts supported with 
cheap ligand frameworks.1 The seminal reports of Baran,23 
MacMillan,4 Doyle,5 Molander,6 Weix,79 Lin,1011 Fu,12 Reis
man,13 Diao,1415 and others1617 in merging redox perturba
tion (photochemical, electrochemical, and purely chemical) 
with catalysis are pivotal to the resurgence and mechanistic 
understanding of firstrow transition metalbased catalysis.
