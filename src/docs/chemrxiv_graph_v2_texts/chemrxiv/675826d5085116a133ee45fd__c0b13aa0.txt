Description:
A Lewis acid that activates substrates by altering their redox characteristics.

Text:
Photoredox catalysis requires a catalyst that is both 
photochemically and redox activetypically a 
compound derived from an organic dye or a complex 
of a redoxactive metal, such as ruthenium or iridium 
(see 
Fig. 1a).710 
Conversely, 
redox
inactiveinnocent metals, such as scandium, which 
have a predominantly trivalent redoxstable state, are 
not directly involved in photoredox reactions.1113 
Nevertheless, 
these 
metals, 
and 
particularly 
Sc(OTf)3, can serve as Lewis acids (LA) that activate 
substratesorganophotocatalysts by altering their 
redox characteristics, thereby facilitating their 
participation in photoredox and photosensitisation 
reactions (Figs. 1b and 1c).1215 For instance, the 
redox properties of a flavin derivative (Fl) were 
significantly enhanced via their coordination to 
Sc(OTf)3.

Description:
Functions as a sole photoredox catalyst facilitating aerobic oxidation of benzylic CH bonds and direct oxidative cyanation of arenes.

For 
example, Fukuzumi24 recorded the EPR spectrum of 
the (HMPA)3Sc3O2 complex stabilised by three 
equivalents of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) 
ligand, formed via PET from the singlet excited state 
of 
1benzyl1,4dihydronicotinamide 
dimer 
1(BNA)2, to O2. This procedure was accompanied 
by fast cleavage of the CC bond in the formed 
(BNA)2 (Fig. 1d, bottom part). Our present study is the first report to demonstrate 
the 
activity 
of 
Sc(OTf)3 
functioning 
as 
a sole photoredox catalyst. Sc(OTf)3 is shown to 
facilitate aerobic oxidation of a benzylic CH bond 
and direct oxidative cyanation of arenes as examples 
of CH activation and CC coupling reactions (Fig. 1e).
