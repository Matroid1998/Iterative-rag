Description:
Utilized in the form of carbon nanotubes as an inorganic vector for nucleic acid delivery.

However, the clinical translation 
of viral vectors has been impeded by adverse immune responses, high production costs, 
offtarget insertions, limited cargo gene size, and potential pathogenicity.4,8 Given these 
limitations of viral vectors, attention has pivoted towards nonviral vectors for nucleic acid 
delivery. Nonviral carriers are easier to produce, have better biocompatibility, and provide 
larger genecarrying capacity than viral vectors.5,6 
Further, nonviral vectors can be designed with a wide variety of chemistries, and 
this tunability enables unique functionalities at varied stages of the development and 
delivery process. For example, these vectors have taken the form of both organic vectors 
(i.e., liposome and polymer particles) and inorganic vectors (i.e., mesoporous silica, gold, 
carbon nanotubes, etc. ).7 This variety of vectors provides access to stimuliresponsive 
release mechanisms (i.e.
