Description:
Exhibits branching in 3MLCT decay upon 400 nm excitation, with components of 110 fs and 9 ps.

More recently, utilis
ing fsresolved Xray emission spectroscopy (XES) Kunnus et al.19
identified that upon 400 nm excitation, the 3MLCT decay ex
hibits branching with a 110 fs 3MLCT 3MC component (40)
and a 9 ps one (60), the latter being identical to the 3MLCT
lifetime determined by TOAS; we note that a similar branching
was observed for a COOHderivative of Fe(bmip)22 by vibra
tional coherence spectroscopy20. Furthermore, coherent oscilla
tions with a 278 fs period were identified in the timeresolved XES
and Xray solution scattering (XSS) signals, assigned to breathing
wavepacket motion in the 3MC state; such oscillations are also ap
parent in the TOAS data but were not analysed and in most cases
were not observed by XES.
