of heterocycle scaffolds into complex drug 
molecules, and the efficient preparation of serval bioactive compounds. Heterocycles are a crucial class of compounds with significant applications and notable biological 
activities, particularly azaheterocycle and oxaheterocycle, which are widely found in bioactive molecules, 
pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and natural products (Fig. 1a)13. From 2015 to 2020, azaheterocycles and 
oxaheterocycles accounted for 88 and 26, respectively, in the 164 smallmolecule drugs approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)4. As a consequence, extensive studies have focused on
