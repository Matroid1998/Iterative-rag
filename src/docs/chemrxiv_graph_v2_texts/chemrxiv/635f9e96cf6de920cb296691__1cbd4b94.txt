Description:
Forms reactive species in inflammatory processes to destroy microorganisms.

Cells use biomolecules to transmit information. This communication occurs in waves of 
biomolecules from a transmitter cell through the extracellular space to other (receiver) cells. This type of signal transmission takes place in many biological situations such as the 
communication of neurons1 via the release of neurotransmitters or in cells of the immune 
system2, which form reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in inflammatory processes to 
destroy microorganisms. The concentration of the released substances changes spatially and 
temporally and is a biochemical fingerprint of the biological state.
