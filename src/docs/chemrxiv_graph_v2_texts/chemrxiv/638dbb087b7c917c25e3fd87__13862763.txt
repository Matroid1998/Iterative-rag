Description:
Trithiolatobridged dinuclear compounds that are promising scaffolds as potential organometallic drugs.

Text:
Additionally, lipid analogues with 
antiproliferative properties can be taken up by the parasites, which results in parasite membrane defects, and 
potential death 14. Trithiolatobridged dinuclear ruthenium(II)arene compounds (as A1A2 and B in Figure 1) are promising 
scaffolds as potential organometallic drugs. This type of dinuclear ruthenium(II) compounds are not only 
highly cytotoxic against human cancer cells 20 but also efficient against various protozoan parasites, such as 
Toxoplasma gondii 21, Neospora caninum 22 and Trypanosoma brucei 23. The halfmaximal 
proliferation inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of complexes A1 (R  Me), A2 (R  But) and B against in vitro 
cultured T. gondii tachyzoites were 34, 62 and 1 nM, respectively, and these compounds did not impair the 
viability of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) used as host cells 21.
