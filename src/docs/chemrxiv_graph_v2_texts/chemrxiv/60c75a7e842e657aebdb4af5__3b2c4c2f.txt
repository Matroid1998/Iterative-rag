Quantum chemical calculations and datasets 
All possible structures made of two atoms AA and AA where 
A,A  C,N,P,O,S or C3 or C6 as the core structure and 
combinations of halogen (H,F,Cl,Br,I) as substituents were 
previously generated by our group.5759 Up to four levels of 
theory (HF, B3LYP, MP2 and CCSD) were used in these studies 
and B3LYP frequency calculations were completed for all 
structures. As shown in Table 2, we improved upon existing 
results by performing singlepoint electronic energy calculation 
at CCSD(T)6311G(d,p) on diastereomer and conformer 
groups. For the constitutional isomer group, original MP26
