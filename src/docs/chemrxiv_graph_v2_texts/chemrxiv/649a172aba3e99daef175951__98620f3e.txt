Description:
Used as a donor in emitters containing an anthraquinone acceptor.

Text:
DR and NIR emitters 
are integral components in medical diagnostics and biomedical imaging (Li et al., 2022), optical 
communication (Minotto et al., 2020), remote sensing (Zhuo et al., 2022), security (Kim et al., 
2014), night vision (Park et al., 2023), and data storage (Xiong et al., 2023). Anthraquinone is a 
strong acceptor and has been incorporated in a number of lowenergy emissive donoracceptor 
TADF emitters. In early work, Adachi and coworkers (Zhang et al., 2014) reported a family of 
emitters containing an anthraquinone acceptor linked to diphenylamine (a1a3) or triphenylamine 
donors (b1b3). The family of compounds b1b3 have higher PL, ranging from 5962,
