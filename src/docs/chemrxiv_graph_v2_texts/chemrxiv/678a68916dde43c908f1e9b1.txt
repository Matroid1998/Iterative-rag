Description:
A route for green and efficient ionic liquids synthesis.

21 But, to our konwledge, no other
attempt to functionalize RFs particles with ionic structures
has been proposed yet. We propose here to use a ionic
liquids synthetic methodology to modify RF composition. The dimethylcarbonate route refers to a wellknown strat
egy for a green and efficient ionic liquids synthesis, that
lead to the formation of new ion pairs through a metathe
sis reaction between an methylcarbonatebased ionic liq
uids (CationMeOCO2) and an protic precursor (AH) and
volatile compounds (MeOH and H2O). 22
CationMeOCO2AH
CationAMeOHH2O
That synthetic route has been used for the synthesis of
more than 100 different ionic liquids, but also for TiO2 par
ticles functionalization, 23 and ionomer synthesis. 24.
