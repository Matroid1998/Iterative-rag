Description:
A group that can be feasibly replaced by 3,3difluorooxetane for bioisosteric purposes.

In this work, 
we have turned our attention to 3,3difluorooxetane (3,3diFox) 
that potentially resembles many common FGs (e.g., ester or 
amide, acetal, small (cyclo)alkyl, etc.) and hence has a great 
potential for bioisosteric replacements. In view of that, we 
developed an approach to the multigram synthesis of 3,3diFox
containing 
building 
blocks 
and 
studied 
numerous 
physicochemical (i.e. aciditybasicity, lipophilicity, Hammett 
constant), structural, and electronic properties, as well as 
chemical stability of model derivatives. Finally, we demonstrated 
feasibility of bioisosteric replacement of tertbutyl group with 3,3
