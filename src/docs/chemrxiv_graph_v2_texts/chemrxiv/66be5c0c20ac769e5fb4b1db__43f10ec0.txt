Description:
A surface on which template-free nanorings form highly ordered arrays.

Text:
These parameters and the behavior of the crystals during 
diffraction experiments suggested formation of flat layers of 
nanorings with hexagonal symmetry, separated by disordered 
solvent and poorly ordered with respect to each other along the 
unique axis. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has shown that 
templatefree nanorings (cPNs) with N  8 form highly ordered 
arrays, on a graphite surface, with the porphyrins parallel to the 
surface. The larger nanorings (N  2440) also form stacked 
aggregates on a gold surface, if deposited in the absence of 
pyridine.16 However, STM images of these species only provide 
information in two dimensions, and lack atomic resolution. a. Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory,
