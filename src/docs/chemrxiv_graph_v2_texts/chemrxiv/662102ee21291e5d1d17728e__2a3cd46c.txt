Description:
Elements that can be mixed in a MXene structure to form either random or ordered arrangements.

Text:
To date, more than 
50 MXenes have been reported to be successfully synthesised.12 The family of MXenes is further expanded 
when two transition metals are mixed in a MXene structure, in which the transition metal may either be 
arranged randomly across all the M layers, or they may form ordered structures.1921 Given that the ratio of M 
and X in these double transition metal MAX precursors can be controlled as needed, the number of possible 
MXenes can be limitless.
