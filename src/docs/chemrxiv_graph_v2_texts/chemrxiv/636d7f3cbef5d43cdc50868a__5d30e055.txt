Description:
Commonly found in hydrated anion layers of Fe(II)Fe(III) layered double hydroxides.

Text:
Green rusts are Fe(II)Fe(III) layered double hydroxides with a pyroauritetype structure having 
alternating positively charged Fe(II)Fe(III) hydroxide layers and hydrated anion (commonly Cl, 
SO42, or CO32) layers 1. Green rusts are key components of the biogeochemical cycling of Fe in 
aquatic and terrestrial systems and are found in Fe(II)Fe(III) transition zones in a variety of natural 
and engineered environments 219. They are highly redoxactive, and over the past 30 years have 
been shown to reduce a wide range of organic and inorganic pollutants including transition metals 
(V(V), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Tc(VII), Ag(I), Pt(VI), Au(III), and Hg(II)) 2028, metalloids (Se(VI) and 
Te(VI)(IV)) 2931, actinides (U(VI) and Np(V)) 3235, nitrate 3639, azo dyes 40,41, 
nitroaromatics (PNP and TNT) 4244, organonitrogen explosives (NTO, DNAN, HMX, and RDX) 
42,43,45,46, and halogenated organics 4750.
