Description:
Potent anticancer agents that mediate effects through apoptosis induction, immune system modulation, and angiogenesis inhibition.

Text:
These secondary mechanisms 
include the abilities of an agent to alter DNA repair or cause genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, 
oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, immortalization or alter cell proliferation, 
cell death, or nutrient supply7. The effect of carcinogen exposure has also been established to alter 
biochemical and hematological profiles in humans 89 
Secondary metabolites from plant sources like flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, and others have been 
found to be potent anticancer agents1011. The anticancer effect of these natural products is mediated by 
different mechanisms, including apoptosis induction, immune system modulation, and angiogenesis 
inhibition 12. Senna alata is highly significant due to the abundant bioactive chemical compounds 
which have been reported to display numerous biological activities 13 These biological activities 
include antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancerous, antimutagenic and antidiabetic activities.
