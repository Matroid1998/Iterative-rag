Description:
Produced during photosynthesis in the oxygen-evolving complex involving manganese.

Text:
Manganese can be found in various oxidation states in solidstate materials, from 0 to 7.1 Despite 
its low stability and scarcity, pentavalent manganese (V) is at the origin of important properties. It 
can be used to design colorful blue or green pigments.2,3 Mn(V) compounds have been considered 
as laser materials,4 and also raise interest due to intriguing magnetic properties.5,6 Mn(V) is also 
involved in the oxygenevolving complex for the production of dioxygen during photosynthesis.7,8 
This suggests that Mn(V) compounds could find interest for use in water oxidation electrocatalysis, 
provided that they can be used in conditions where the oxidation state and structural features are 
maintained.
