Description:
Compounds used in Michael-alkylation organocascade reactions.

Text:
Organocascade reactions initiated by the Michael reaction are 
highly efficient for the construction of spirooxindolefused 
derivatives,7 using either oxindoles with nucleophilic C3 
(Michael donors)810 or electrophilic methyleneindolinones 
(Michael acceptors).11,12 Interestingly, a combination of both 
types of starting materials was applied by Wang for the 
preparation 
of 
highlyrigid 
bispirooxindoles 
via 
Michaelspirocyclization reaction promoted by bifunctional 
organocatalyst (Scheme 1A).13 Recently, our group described 
Michaelalkylation 
organocascade 
reaction 
of 
3(2
bromoethyl)oxindoles 
with 
,unsaturated 
aldehydes 
efficiently catalyzed by chiral secondary amine producing 
valuable spirooxindolefused cyclopentanes (Scheme 1B).14
