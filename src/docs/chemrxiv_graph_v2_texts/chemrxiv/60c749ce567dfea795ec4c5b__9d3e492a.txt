Description:
A component in solar cell architecture, known as indium tin oxide.

showed that a simple treatment of the Sb2S3 layer with thioacetamide (TA) was able to 
eliminate defects in the Sb2S3 layer and hence they obtained a 7.5  efficiency, a record for a fully 
solidstate chalcogenidesensitized solar cell at that time (2014).5 Savadogo et al. reported an ITO 
(indium tin oxide)Sb2S3Pt solar cell with an efficiency of 5.5  and the highest ever reported 
opencircuit voltage of 770 mV for this material.6 For a typical thin film device architecture, the 
best performing Sb2S3 solar cell is from Yuan et al. using an ITOCdSSb2S3Au architecture (3.5 
).7 Despite the broad interest and promising efficiency in PV research, Sb2S3 has not yet been 
explored extensively for photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC) applications.
