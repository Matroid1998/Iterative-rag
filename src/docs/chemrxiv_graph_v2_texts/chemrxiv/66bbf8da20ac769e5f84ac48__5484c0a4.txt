Description:
React under highly basic conditions potentially through the formation of a cyclopropene.

Related work on the reaction of halogensubstituted cyclopropanes under highly basic conditions presumably 
37 
proceeds through the intermittent formation of a cyclopropene, although a formal substitution reaction is also considered 
38 
as a potential reaction pathway.1215 As such, the study of the reactivity of such cyclopropenebased Michael acceptors 
39 
remains, even today, a significant synthetic challenge. 40 
The development of a uniform strategy to first access cyclopropenebased Michael acceptors and engage these in a general 
41 
protocol to introduce a nucleophile is, therefore, highly attractive. To achieve this goal, firstly, it is a prerequisite to access 
42 
a cyclopropenesubstituted carbonyl compound, which is known as fleeting intermediates from laserflash photolysis 
43 
studies of styrylsubstituted diazo compounds1618.
