Description:
A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fever and treat pain or inflammation.

Text:
However, some of these drugs can also interact with
other drugs and biomolecules, which can lead to adverse effects or reduced efficacy. In this study, we investigated the anticancer drug interactions with the kinase domain of
human HER2 using a combination of docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We
focused on the following drugs and biomolecules, which are already available

Oxycodone

Methylamino Luvinilate

Ciclesonide

Salicylic Acid

Melphalan

Ibuprofen

NAcetyl Tyrosine

Aspirin

Phenylalanine
2. Methods
Docking simulations
CBDock is a webbased server for proteinligand docking. The following parameters
were used for the CBDock docking simulations

Algorithm Genetic algorithm

Population size 100
