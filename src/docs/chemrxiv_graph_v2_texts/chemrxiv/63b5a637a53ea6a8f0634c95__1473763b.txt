Description:
A CN-linked cyclic peptide derived from phenolic-residue oxidation.

Text:
While these biaryl linkages are 
frequently identified as clinical markers of oxidative 
stress and aging, they have been shown to impart bene
ficial structural stability and elasticity to peptide and 
proteinbased systems.1416 Similar transformations are 
commonly observed in natural product biosynthesis 
pathways, resulting in structurally constrained mono 
and polycyclic peptides with promising and diverse bio
logical activities.17 Exemplary biaryllinked cyclic pep
tides that derive from phenolicresidue oxidation in
clude the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, K13 
1 (COlinked), myxarylin 2 (CNlinked), and CC
linked antimicrobial peptides such as arylomycin A2 3 
(Figure 1A).1823 
 The desirable properties associated with cyclic pep
tides have motivated the development of creative syn
thetic methods to prepare cyclic peptides.
