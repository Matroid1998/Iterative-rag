Used in enzymatic transformations and amenable to telescoped sequences with slurry-to-slurry reactions.

of mutations in the hydrophobic binding tunnel. Since the variants V80F and V80W did not 
display MichaelisMententype kinetics with 5, their catalytic efficiencies are not available (n.a.). Please see the Supplementary

chains (18 and 19) or a phenyl group (20) gives competent 
substrates. Similarly, the 3ethyl analogue 21 is converted, 
albeit more slowly. Although we performed these reactions 
in dilute, homogenous assay mixtures for the sake of kinetic 
analyses, these enzymatic transformations proved readily 
scalable and amenable to telescoped sequences with non
purified pyrophosphates and slurrytoslurry reactions (see 
the SI for details and examples).
