Description:
A complex that reacts with various ligands to produce different molecules.

Text:
4 The Re2Cl4(dppm)2 
complex react with different ligands to produce a variety of 
molecules, those ligands are, for example, dioxygen,
5 
PhSeSePh, 6 2mercaptoquinoline, 7 2hydroxypyridine, 8 carbon 
disulfide,
9
 sulfur 
dioxide,
10
 triphenylguanidine,
11
 and 
acetylacetonate,
12
 carbon 
monoxide, 
isocyanides, 
and 
nitriles.13,14,15,16 Recently, Chattopadhyay and coworker17 have 
synthesised Re2(dppm)(S2CNEt2)4 (10) complex (Figure1a) 
starting from the Re2Cl4(dppm)2. The cyclic voltammetry 
measurements of the Re2(dppm)(S2CNEt2)4 complex display 
two quasireversible oneelectron oxidation processes, the two 
oxidation processes in the ranges 0.022 V to 0.070 V and 1.22 
V to 1.196 V are assigned to the Re25Re24 and Re26Re25 
couples, respectively. The Xray data is available just for the 
neutral structure (10).
