Description:
Molecular CO2R catalysts that can function in gas-fed flow cells.

Text:
In contrast, hydrophobicity is advantageous for catalysts applied in gas diffusion 
electrodes, which feed CO2 to the catalyst directly from the gas phase and the reaction largely 
occurs at a gasliquidsolid interphase.11 In this context, rationally incorporated hydrophobic 
elements have greatly boosted the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in GDEbased 
reactors.12,13 However, these efforts to date have only been limited to heterogeneous catalysts. Molecular CO2R catalysts have indeed been integrated with gasfed flow cells and initial results 
have demonstrated that phthalocyaninesporphyrins,1417 Co quaterpyridine18 and Ni cyclam19 
catalysts can also function in this geometry. However, most of these molecular systems have been 
metal complexes that possess an extended conjugated system that facilitates their ease of 
adsorption onto the carbon surfaces in a GDE.
