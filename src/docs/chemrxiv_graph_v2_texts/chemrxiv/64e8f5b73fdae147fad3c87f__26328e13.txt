Description:
Formed from the oxidation of M(OH)2 prior to OER.

Text:
Prior to 
65 
OER, Fedoped M(OH)2 is oxidized to (nominally) MOOH, accompanied by a 
66 
contraction of the MO bond length and interlayer distance, consistent with stronger MO 
67 
bonds upon formal cation oxidation25. Fe substitution induces a positive shift of the 
68 
apparent M2M3 redox potential, indicative of electronic interactions between Fe and host 
69 
Ni or Co cations. The oxidation state of Fe during OER at the active site remains a point 
70 
of discussion. Both Fe3 and Fe4 were found under OER conditions for codeposited Ni
71 
Fe or CoFe (oxy)hydroxides, while in nonaqueous electrolyte Fe6 was identified and 
72 
invoked as the active intermediate2629.
