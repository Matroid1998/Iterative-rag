. The 
efficient 
catalytic 
transformation of feedstocks to chemicals and 
materials for society remains at the forefront of 
technological needs in the 21st century.1 Grand 
challenges in catalysis aim for the sustainable 
manufacture of monomers2,3,4, the elimination of 
carbon dioxide5,6, the fixing of nitrogen7,8,9,10, and 
the environmental remediation of pollutants11,12. New catalysts should be synthesized from lowcost, 
earthabundant materials13 that operate with long
term stability and negligible environmental impact 
within a process designed to optimally benefit from 
catalytic rate enhancement. Catalyst development 
also aims for maximum catalytic rate within the 
limitations of the Sabatier principle14 for multi
step chemistry which includes adsorption, surface 
catalytic reactions, and desorption (Figure 1A).
