Description:
An environmental transformation product of the antioxidant tire rubber additive 6PPD, causing species-specific acute toxicity at ultratrace levels.

Text:
N(1,3Dimethylbutyl)Nphenylpphenylenediamine quinone (6PPDQ) is an environmental 
transformation product of the antioxidant tire rubber additive 6PPD, and has been shown to cause 
speciesspecific acute toxicity at ultratrace levels.1 Identified in 2021 by Tian et al., 6PPDQ is 
responsible for the mass prespawn mortality events and associated urban runoff mortality 
syndrome (URMS) observed in Pacific Northwest Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch).1 Given its 
predicted global generation,2 ubiquity in urban waterways,36 and markedly low 24hour median 
lethal concentration (LC50) of 95 ngL in adult Coho salmon,7 6PPDQ is a toxicant of great and 
widespread concern.
