The cornerstone of metallaphotoredox approaches, enabling diverse cross-coupling strategies.

Introduction 
Solutionstate photocatalysis is an established and widely used synthetic methodology, employing 
visible light to drive energy and electron transfer reactions.16 In particular, metallaphotoredox catalysis, 
involving the synergistic dual use of a transition metal catalyst and a photocatalyst, has dramatically ex
panded the utility of lightdriven transformations, and is one of the most valuable applications of photoca
talysis towards the synthesis of industrially relevant small molecules.7 While copper and palladium com
plexes have seen some use in metallaphotoredox reactions,8, 9 nickel complexes remain the cornerstone of 
these approaches, enabling a diverse range of new crosscoupling strategies.10, 11 The key value of this ap
proach stems from its complementary reactivity to traditional palladiumcatalyzed crosscoupling reactions
