Used in lithium batteries.

Although several multiscale models
and advanced computational methods have been developed in the last decades, further
work is required to expand their implementations in systems like lithium batteries.9
One of the top promising materials considered for lithium battery anodes is silicon,
mainly due to its large theoretical capacity (3579 mAhg) and natural abundance.10,11 The
main drawback of this electrode is the large volume expansion it suffers during charge,
which provokes fractures and loss of electrical contact with the corresponding hindrance
in performance and useful life.
