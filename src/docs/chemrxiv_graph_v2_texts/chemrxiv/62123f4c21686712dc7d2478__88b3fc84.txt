Description:
Simple amphipathic molecules with a polar headgroup and a hydrophobic tail, capable of forming micelles and vesicles above certain concentrations.

Text:
Lipids, sometimes regarded as amphiphiles or surfactants, are simple amphipathic molecules, possessing a polar 
headgroup and a hydrophobic tail. These molecules can spontaneously aggregate to form structurallydiverse 
assemblies such as micelles and vesicles when present above certain threshold concentrations (e.g. critical 
micelle concentration, CMC). As the primary component of the membranes of all living cells, assemblies of lipids 
and their growth dynamics have been the focus of research for many decades2. This uncovered the technological 
usefulness of lipid assemblies, particularly in the fields of medicine and synthetic chemistry3, 4. It has also offered 
insights on both the thermodynamic attributes of lipid assemblies, such as structural stability and electrostatics, 
and their kinetic parameters, such as their catalytic parameters5, 6.
