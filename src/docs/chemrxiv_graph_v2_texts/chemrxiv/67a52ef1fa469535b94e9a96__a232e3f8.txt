Description:
Products formed from the nonoxidative coupling of CH4.

The pri
mary challenge in photo catalysis is to design catalysts 
that can efficiently utilize visible light in solar spectrum 
and to reduce insufficient selectivity and increase the 
yield of the desired product ethane and reduce unde
sired products like CO2. There has been an intense in
terest to find a green reaction for CH activation of CH4. The nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) to higher 
hydrocarbons is one way for breaking the CH bond in 
CH4.6 The transition metal nano clusters (Ti, W, Mo, Fe, 
Ni, etc.) act as robust catalysts of the activation of CH 
bonds.710 
Metal nano clusters are extremely small particles, 1 to 10 
nanometers in size, and are composed of atoms of a 
single metal element (monometal) or multiple ele
ments (alloys).
