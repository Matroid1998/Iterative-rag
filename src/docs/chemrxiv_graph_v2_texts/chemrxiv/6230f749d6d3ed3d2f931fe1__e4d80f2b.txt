Description:
Emissions result from hydrogen production using fossil fuels, with varying amounts depending on the fuel source.

Text:
Utilizing 
fossil fuels for hydrogen production as well as thermal energy results in significant carbon dioxide 
emissions, ranging from a theoretical minimum of 1.8 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for natural gas23, to 
around 3.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3 for coal;21,24 the global average CO2 emissions are approximately 
2.9 tons CO2 per ton NH3.23 As a result of tremendous worldwide demand driven primarily by the 
fertilizer and chemicals industry, HaberBosch ammonia produced from fossilfuel derived 
hydrogen accounts for approximately 1.5 of worldwide CO2 emissions.23 If transportation fuels 
are to comprise another source of demand for ammonia, it is critical to mitigate the carbon footprint 
associated with current methods of ammonia production.
