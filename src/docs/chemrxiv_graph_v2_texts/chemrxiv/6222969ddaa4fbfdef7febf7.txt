Description:
A compound involved in iodoperfluoroalkylation reactions in synthetic photochemistry.

Text:
For example, PDIs 
have garnered attention in synthetic photochemistry, such as aryl halide reduction and olefin 
iodoperfluoroalkylation, wherein the PDI is reduced by a sacrificial reductant under illumination 
to generate the radical anion R.814 R then absorbs another photon to produce the doublet 
excited state 2R, which is a strong reducing agent capable of driving challenging reduction 
reactions.14,15 Thus, the efficient production of R under irradiation is generally regarded as an 
essential step in PDIbased photocatalytic applications. The method of covalently tethering two functionalities into the same catalytic system is an 
interesting prospect.16 Selfndoping is a method of electronic doping in organic semiconductors
