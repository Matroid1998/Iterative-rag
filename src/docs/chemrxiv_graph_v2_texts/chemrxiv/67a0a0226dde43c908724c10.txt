Description:
Used in liquid metal alloys that offer intrinsic deformability while maintaining metallic conductivity.

Liquid metals,
primarily based on gallium alloys, offer intrinsic deformability
while maintaining metallic conductivity16. Recent developments
have improved patterning capabilities29 and enabled higher res
olution features30. Nevertheless, these materials face ongoing
challenges in biocompatibility and longterm stability16, particu
larly for biomedical applications31. Organic conductors, such as
PEDOTPSS and its derivatives, provide another materialsbased
solution32. While offering intrinsic deformability and compati
bility with solution processing33, these materials typically exhibit
lower conductivity compared to metallic conductors34, and of
ten face stability issues in ambient conditions for biomedical ap
plications35. Stretchable composites use nanomaterials such as
nanowires36,37, or nanoparticles38 as filler in a stretchable ma
trix, and have demonstrated impressive combinations of electrical
and mechanical properties3941.
