Description:
Common intercalation hosts utilized as cathode materials in lithium and sodium-ion batteries.

Electrochemical energy storage devices such as the lithiumion battery (LIB), as well as in 
emerging cell chemistries like sodiumion batteries, experience an increasing global demand. Their functioning mechanism is the electrochemical intercalation of ions from the electrolyte 
into the solidstate host structure of the electrode materials. Layered transition metal oxides 
(TMOs) are common intercalation hosts utilized as cathode materials, but also as alternatives 
for carbonbased anode materials in both lithium and sodiumion batteries. Among them, 
titanatebased materials have attracted interest due to their relative abundance, low toxicity 
and structuralchemical tunability.
