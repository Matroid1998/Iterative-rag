In this work, we compare 47 different dynamic discharge profiles with realistic average discharge
37
currents ranging from C16 to C2, cycled over 24 months (where 1 C corresponds to the nominal
38
current that discharges the battery in one hour) on 92 commercial silicon oxide  graphite  nickel cobalt
39
aluminum lithiumion cells. We elucidate the effect of dynamic, nonconstantcurrent discharge profiles
40
while holding the average Crate and voltage window constant. Surprisingly, we find that dynamic cycling
41
enhances battery lifetime by up to 38 . Moreover, we quantify the tipover Crate balancing time
42
induced aging and cycling aging to be approximately 0.4 C, in the range of realistic Crates, contrary to
43
previous reports 15.
