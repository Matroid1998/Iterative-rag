Description:
Less symmetric compounds that exhibit a multiple resonance effect.

Text:
Differential stabilization of the S1 
state by double excitations can then lead to a negative ST.1, 2 Such an alternating HOMOLUMO 
density pattern was also realized in less symmetric boron carbon nitrides, such as DABNA, by 
Hatakeyama and coworkers and termed multiple resonance effect.21, 22 While the chromophores of 
Hatakeyama and coworkers are prominent representatives of the thermally activated delayed 
fluorescence (TADF) mechanism, a negative ST cannot be realized in this class of molecules 
according to current knowledge.13, 23 
 These observations indicate that molecular symmetry plays an essential role for the realization of 
organic chromophores with negative ST.

Description:
Explored in computational work for their triangular structure.

Text:
While the paradigm of triangular carbon nitrides and boron 
carbon nitrides has extensively been explored in recent computational work,1, 2, 16, 19, 20, 24 we ask in 
the present computational study whether other white spots may exist in chemical space with hitherto 
undiscovered symmetryenabled S1T1 inversion. The hexagonal symmetry (D6h) of benzene is the 
most natural symmetry for aromatic compounds. In benzene, the HOMO as well as the LUMO are 
doubly degenerate. As is well known, the HOMOLUMO transition in benzene gives rise to the six 
valence excited states three singlet states and three triplet states with the symmetries B2u, B1u, E1u 
within the D6h symmetry point group.
