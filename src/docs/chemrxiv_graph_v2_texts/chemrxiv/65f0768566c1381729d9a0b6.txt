Description:
Dyes characterized by two heterocycles connected by odd numbers of methine units.

Text:
Polymethine dyes, characterized by two heterocycles 
connected by odd numbers of methine units, are a major 
family of dyes with more than 150 years of history.1 In 
particular, heptamethine fluorophores, which are the 
polymethine dyes with seven methine units (Figure 1), 
have gained significant interest due to their favorable 
nearinfrared (NIR, 7001000 nm) excitation and emission 
properties that enable deeper penetration and reduced 
background than visible fluorophores, making them high
ly suitable for in vivo imaging applications.
