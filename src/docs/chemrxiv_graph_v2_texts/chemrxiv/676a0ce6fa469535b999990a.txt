Description:
An API affected by polymorphs, impacting its solubility, bioavailability, stability, and dissolution rate.

Text:
Such forms may lead to the inability to obtain a crystal 
form that was previously prepared for pharmaceutical or other applications, thus necessitate the 
redesign of the production process.2 They can alter the solubility, bioavailability, stability, and 
dissolution rate of the API, significantly impacting the quality, efficacy, and safety of 
pharmaceutical products. The pharmaceutical industry has suffered a few disastrous issues due 
to lateappearing polymorphs, leading to patent disputes, regulatory issues, and even market 
recalls, including the famous cases of ritonavir,3 rotigotine,4 and many others.2 Therefore, it is 
crucial to identify and characterize all possible polymorphs of a given API and understand the 
factors that influence their formation and transformation.
