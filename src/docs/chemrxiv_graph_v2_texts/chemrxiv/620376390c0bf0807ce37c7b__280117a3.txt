Description:
A derivative of carbonyl compounds that exhibits nucleophilicity at the alpha carbon.

Text:
The introduction of functional groups at the a carbon of carbonyl compounds is a common transformation in 
synthetic organic chemistry. aFunctionalized ketones are substructures found in many natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, and other functional organic compounds.1 The functionalization reaction relies on the inherent 
nucleophilicity of the a carbon of the enol (or enolate) derivative of the carbonyl compound, which reacts with an 
electrophilic reaction partner in this process. Many carbonbased electrophiles can be used, leading to the 
formation of CC bonds,2 but the use of heteroatomic electrophiles becomes challenging. This is due to the high 
reactivity, and therefore limited functionalgroup compatibility of these species.
