Molecules detected in interstellar environments.

Text:
The synthesis and investigation of the 
reactivity of molecules detected in interstellar 
environments are crucial for comprehending the 
formation of liferelated molecules from simpler ones. Additionally, exploring their reactivity can offer 
valuable insights for the radioastronomy detection of 
related compounds. (Hetero)cumulenes and nitrile
containing molecules have been widely identified in 
interstellar space. The quest for cyanoketene 
(NCCHCO, Scheme 1a) has garnered significant 
attention due to its simplicity and its incorporation of 
the four fundamental elements for liferelated 
molecules.1 

Scheme 1 (a) Cyanoketene, and resonance structures and 
geometries of cyanoketenate. (b) Prior literature on 
formation of anionic ketenates from CO. (c) This work on the 
synthesis of NCCCO cyanoketenate anion.
