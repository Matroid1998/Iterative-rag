Mechanisms of cofactorfree decarboxylases 
Decarboxylases are involved in numerous catabolic and anabolic pathways, including fatty acid 
biosynthesis and the production of biogenic amines such as gaminobutyric acid (GABA) or histamine. Evolution generated a vast structural and mechanistic diversity to accomplish this reaction. Enzymatic 
decarboxylation reactions encompass both oxidative1a and nonoxidative reactions via heterolytic and 
homolytic mechanisms, and employ diverse cofactors. These include pyridoxal phosphate, thiamine 
diphosphate, the pyruvoyl group, heme as well as nonheme diiron centers, and even FAD in a 
photobiocatalytic reaction.1 In contrast, only three decarboxylases are known to catalyze 
decarboxylations without a cofactor. Orotidine5monophosphate decarboxylase, bacterial phenolic acid 
decarboxylase, and arylmalonate decarboxylase2 stabilize the evolving carbanion in the transition state 
without the delocalization into a cofactorsystem.
