Description:
A type of skeleton synthesized by enzymes like AlbS, EcTPS1, and BaTC2, exhibiting flexibility in different conformational ratios.

Text:
Subsequent AlbS, EcTPS1, along with BaTC2, synthesizing 
64 
different types of eunicellane skeletons, were then soon reported7,10,11, further 
65 
enriching the mechanisms of eunicellane biosynthesis (Fig. 1). But all these reported 
66 
eunicellane synthases share a common yettobesolved issue the biosynthesized 
67 
eunicellane scaffolds exhibit flexibility in different conformational ratios6,9,27, 
68 
dramatically impeding NMRbased structural elucidations and bringing great 
69 
challenges for chemical synthesis of eunicellanetype compounds. To address this 
70 
issue and interrogate the fascinating mechanisms involved in governing 
71 
conformational changes, we sought to identify a terpene synthase responsible for 
72 
synthesizing a nonflexible eunicellane scaffold.
