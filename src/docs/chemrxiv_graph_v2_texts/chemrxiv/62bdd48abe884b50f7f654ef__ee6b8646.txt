Description:
Studied for its interaction with Li0 and decomposition on graphite and oxide surfaces.

Text:
Despite of numerous model studies on the formation of the
SEI812 and in particular of BMPTFSI1318 in the past few
years, neither the actual composition of the SEI nor the mech
anisms of its formation are fully clear yet, in particular not
on a molecular scale. Different decomposition products have
been deduced from xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
experiments studying the interaction of Li0 with a BMPTFSI
monolayer on graphite15 and from XPS experiments studying
the interaction of Li0 with BMPTFSI mono or multilayers
on various oxide surfaces (Co3O4, CoO).17,18 XP measure
ments on the interaction of the IL monolayer with graphite
a)Electronic mail axel.grossuniulm.de
(HOPG) suggest, that decomposition mainly affects the an
ion, as the N 1s peak of TFSI declines.

Description:
Analyzed for its atomic constituents using density functional theory and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

To the best of our
knowledge there is no systematic study so far on the decom
position and the formation of different possible products for
varying LiIL ratios employing electronic structure methods. Previous computational studies mainly used ab initio molec
ular dynamics to study the decomposition of (BMP)TFSI at
lithium surfaces.1922 In theses studies different decomposi
tion products were found, including large fragments, such as
NSO2CF3,19,20,22 but also solely atomic constituents,21 de
pending on the length of the simulation. In the present study
we use both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and
xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate possible
products of the reaction
