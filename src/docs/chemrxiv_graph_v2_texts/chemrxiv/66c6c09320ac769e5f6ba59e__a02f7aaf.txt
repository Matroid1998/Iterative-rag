Description:
A conventional donor in the synthesis of novel NHC ligands.

Text:
The design of new functionalized NHCs with nitrogen donor groups has been extensively 
studied due to their coordination flexibility and ability to enhance coordination stability or 
substrate activation in metal NHC complexes 6. These compounds have shown great potential 
to replace conventional phosphine donors in the synthesis of novel NHC ligands 7. Various 
nitrogen donor functionalized NHCs have been wellsynthesized, including those with amine, 
amide, imine, oxazoline, pyrazole, and pyridine functionalities 8. Moreover, the NHCs often 
displace ligands such as nitriles, phosphines, THF, CO, THT, pyridines, and DMS 9,10,11. They can also break dinuclear precursors via aceto or halo bridges to produce monomeric 
complexes. Depending on the metal and reagent stoichiometry, complexes with three carbene 
ligands can be synthesized.
