Description:
A form of carbon with a distinct surface structure affecting reactivity.

Text:
Oxidation of carbon nanoparticles (NPs) at high temperatures is 
relevant to many applications of carbon nanomaterials, but there 
are also interesting fundamental questions relating reactivity to NP 
surface structure, which can vary dramatically for different carbon 
materials (graphitic, diamond, fullerene, etc. ).12 Even for a 
particular type of carbon NP, there can be large NPtoNP 
variations in the number and types of exposed surface sites, 
strongly affecting the rates of processes such as sublimation or 
oxidation.3 Finally, even for a single NP, the surface structure may 
evolve during reaction, resulting in large rate variations.
