Description:
Involved in sensitivity-enhanced transverse mixing sequences for solid-state NMR experiments.

Text:
The recent development of sensitivityenhanced transverse mixing sequences suitable for 1H 
detected solidstate NMR experiments enables fast acquisition of multidimensional experiments for 
protein backbone assignments. These new sequences include two different approaches, Transverse 
mixing optimal control pulses (TROP)1,2 and simplified preservation of equivalent pathways 
spectroscopy (SPEPS)3,4. Both allow for simultaneous magnetization transfers of two components, 
similar to the strategies previously developed for solution NMR experiments5,6, which leads to a 
theoretical increase in the signaltonoise ratio (SNR) by a factor of 2 per indirect dimension. It is 
now straightforward to assemble all sensitivityenhanced 3D and 4D pulse sequences required to 
record spectra for assignments of H, N, C and CO chemical shifts. However, in order to 
unambiguously assign challenging proteins, access to side chain chemical shifts is critical.
