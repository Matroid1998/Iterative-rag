Description:
A type of carbaporphyrin that can be functionalised at the inner C(21) atom with various groups.

Text:
Cobalt complex of Nconfused porphyrin 
(NCP), the first among carbaporphyrins,12, 13 quite effectively 
catalyses cyclopropanation reaction.14 On the other hand, the 
forced proximity of the (typically) aryl fragment to the metal 
centre within the macrocycle creates unique conditions that 
could facilitate its selective functionalisation.10, 15 Thus, NCP 
reacted with a cobalt source can get functionalised at the inner 
C(21) atom with an oxygen atom,16 cyano,17 2chlorovinyl,16 
methyl,18 or tolyl groups,19 depending on the reaction 
conditions. Here, the C(sp3)H activation and functionalisation 
of an carbon atom in ketones within metallocarbaporphyrins 
remain underexplored.
