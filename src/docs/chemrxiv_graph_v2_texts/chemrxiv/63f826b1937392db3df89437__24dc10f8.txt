Description:
An element whose ion migration can be suppressed by Ti dopant.

Text:
of the Ti dopant can significantly increase the kinetic 
barrier of the Co ion migration and thus effectively suppress the formation of the Co 
vacancy cluster. Overall, our work reveals the atomicscale dynamic correlations 
between the TM migrations and the instability of the oxygen sublattice in the cathode 
material, and provides insights about the mechanism of the dopants promotion on the 
stability of cathode materials.
