Description:
A species with a quadruple bond pattern between boron and rhodium.

Text:
Interest in this species has been particularly sparked in the last 
decade by renewed discussion of its chemical bonding in the form of a proposal that it sustains 
a quadruple bond between the carbons as in CC,2,3,4 a claim that generated5 much stimulating 
debate and continues to do so unabated.6 Most recently, the attention has extended to species 
with quadruple bond patterns between carbon and other elements such as CFe7 or related 
main group elements with similar fourfold bond characteristics as in BRh8 or SiRh.9 Such 
diverse reports raise the distinct possibility that room temperaturesolution studies of species 
containing quadruple bonds to carbon will become possible and perhaps even routine. In this 
context then, the recent proposal10,11 of a room temperature chemical synthesis in the
