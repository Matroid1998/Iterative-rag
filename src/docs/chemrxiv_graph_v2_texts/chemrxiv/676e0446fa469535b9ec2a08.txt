Description:
Molecules that self-assemble to form cell membranes.

CG models13 offer the advantage of reduced computational demands compared to 
traditional allatomic (AA) force fields,46 making them particularly suitable for 
simulating complex system functionalities. Currently, CG models have been 
successfully applied to investigate longtimescale functional studies in complex 
systems, such as conformational changes in proteins,7, 8 selfassembly of cell membrane 
phospholipids and viral capsids,9 as well as mechanical properties of biomaterials.10 
Due to the immense potential of CG models in studying complex system functions, they 
have seen rapid development in the last few decades.
