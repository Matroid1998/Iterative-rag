Description:
Third-row transition-metal compounds studied using multireference methods.

Text:
These methods
are sufficient for closedshell systems but may encounter
problems when there is significant multireference ef
fect In the context of the vibrational coupling with the
JT effect, multireference methods with the SOC were
employed by Balasubramanians group for metal clus
ters 3942, by Mondal for the firstrow transitionmetal
trihalides 43, 44, and by Kosekis group for thirdrow
transitionmetal tetrahydrides 45, 46. However, such
an approach has not been applied for MF6 molecules. The static JT distortion itself is well known in the
structures of MF6 molecules with nonzero spin. How
ever, the structure of the thirdrow transition metal hex
afluorides may be stable in the presence of JT distortion.
