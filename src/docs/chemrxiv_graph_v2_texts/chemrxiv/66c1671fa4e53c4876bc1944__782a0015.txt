A ternary chalcogenide material known to take on a stable perovskite structure.

In response to the challenges posed by the toxicity and 
stability concerns inherent in inorganicorganic lead halide 
perovskites, a class of ternary chalcogenide materials with the 
general formula ABQ3, (A Ca, Ba, Sr; B  Zr, Hf, Ti; Q S Se) has 
been put forth as a promising alternative for optoelectronic and 
solar cell applications.12,13 A subset of the materials in this class 
are known to take on a stable perovskite structure under at 
least some conditions, including CaZrS3, SrZrS3, BaZrS3, CaHfS3, 
and BaHfS3;1315 of these, BaZrS3 has garnered the most interest 
largely because of its lower observed band gaps, falling within 
the range of 1.75 to 1.94 eV.12,14,1621 While these values make 
it potentially competitive for solar cell applications, especially in 
a tandem device with silicon, these band gaps are somewhat 
higher than the ideal for singlejunction solar cells and higher 
than those accessible with lead halide perovskites.

Description:
Crystalline thin films produced at temperatures as low as 500 Â°C using solution deposition of molecular precursors.

Text:
achieved temperatures below 700 C 
through pulsed laser deposition,29 while Comparotto et al. grew 
BaZrS3 thin films at 600 C using sputtering and sulfurization.30,31 
More recently, significant advances have been made by Agarwal 
and Bart in preparing thin films from the solution deposition of 
molecular precursors, with crystalline thin films of BaZrS33, 
BaTiS3, and BaHfS3 produced at temperatures as low as 500 
oC.32,33 
 An alternative approach to solutionprocessed thin film 
deposition is through the preparation and use of colloidal 
nanocrystal inks;34,35 notably, Nag et al.
