Description:
The second largest supplier of greenhouse effect.

These particles are typically 
only microns in diameter, and form the main source of PM2.5.. Soot can also form 
carbonaceous aerosols in air, which is the second largest supplier of greenhouse effect after 
carbon dioxide (3). In addition, soot particles can carry a variety of toxic substances into the 
respiratory system. Soot particles less than 100 nm in diameter can enter the circulatory system 
via the alveoli and can be transported to the liver, heart and even brain, causing a variety of 
diseases (4, 5). Inhibiting soot formation requires a fundamental understanding of the physicochemical 
processes from fuel to soot. At present, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are 
widely recognized to be the important precursors of soot formation (6).
