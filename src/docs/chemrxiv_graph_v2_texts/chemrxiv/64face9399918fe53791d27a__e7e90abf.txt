Description:
Used to protect AuPt based tubular micromotors from thiol toxicity and to decolorize polluted water from toxic organic dyes.

investigated MnO2 for the removal of organic dye from contaminated 
water.21 
Our group has extensively studied the synthesis of MnO2 based micromotors of various 
geometries and evaluated the effect of polymorphic forms on motion.22,23 We used MnO2 
to protect AuPt based tubular micromotors from thiol toxicity during the surface 
functionalization with an alkanethiol, and demonstrated a proofofconcept application of 
MnO2 particles to decolorize polluted water form toxic organic dyes.8,24 
Here, we expand our previous work on water remediation by performing a detailed study of 
the use of MnO2 particles to remove rhodamine 6G (R6G) from polluted water. We analyze
