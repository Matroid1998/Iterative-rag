Description:
Electrophilic compounds bearing a proximal oxidizing group such as azo or nitroso.

On the 
other hand, the Tan group elegantly developed organocatalyzed C(aryl)C(aryl) coupling of 
electrophilic naphthalenes bearing a proximal oxidizing group such as azo or nitroso.21 
Among these reported systems, substrate activation remains a leading strategy to ensure catalytic 
reactivity,22 such as installation of an EWG ortho to the halo group in the aryl halide10 or 
employment of a reactive hypervalent iodine(III) reagent.23 To better achieve substrate activation, 
we envisioned electrophilic benzotriazinones that participate with denitrogenation as a driving force 
(Scheme 1b). Indeed, catalytic asymmetric reactions have been reported for benzotriazinones, but 
the coupling reagents have been fully limted to bonds.
