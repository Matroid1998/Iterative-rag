Description:
The propyl ester of gallic acid used as a permeation enhancer excipient in clinical trials.

Text:
Challenges usually come from passive or carriermediated transcellular permeation 
across phospholipid bilayers, as well as restricted paracellular transport via tight junctions. Propyl 
gallate (PG) has been used as a permeation enhancer excipient in several clinical trials35. To 
increase oral bioavailability, the MEDI7219 peptide was formulated with a novel combination of 
excipients, with the primary permeation enhancers including PG 6. PG is the propyl ester of gallic acid and is a Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) 
compound used in foods, cosmetics and hair products at low levels7. PG protects oils and fats in 
products from oxidation and has been added to foods containing oils and fats since 1948 8. It is 
estimated that propyl gallate is used in over 150 cosmetic products at a maximum concentration 
of 0.1 9.
