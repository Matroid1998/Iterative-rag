Description:
A value-added product derived from methane.

Text:
Earth is home to rich reserves of methane, making it an attractive feedstock and a foremost
competitor for the production of green fuel. 1 The myriad occurrence of methane can be
attributed to its stable nature. Higher symmetry (Td) along with close shell electronic con
 guration, wide HOMOLUMO gap (8.9 eV), and four stable CH bonds (Ebd 4.5 eV),
makes it thermodynamically and kinetically stable at room temperature. Given the signi 
cant mass percentage of hydrogen (25.13) in methane, it is widely used for hydrogen pro
duction.2 Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and FischerTropsch (FT) synthesis are widely
used processes for conversion of methane to hydrogen as well as to valueadded products like
methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, higher hydrocarbons, and FT fuels.
