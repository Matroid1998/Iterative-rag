Description:
A core structure used in NIR fluorogenic probes for in vivo imaging.

Complementing these efforts, approaches using always
ON nearinfrared (NIR) probes have provided insights into tu
mor and offtarget uptake.2023 Fluorogenic turnON probes that 
use NIR wavelengths (700 to 900 nm) have significant poten
tial to provide insight into dynamics and localization of biolog
ical phenomena in complex tissue settings. We recently devel
oped the first class of NIR fluorogenic probes based on the hep
tamethine cyanine core.24 These fluorogenic cyanine carba
mates (CyBams) exhibit exceptional turnON ratios and untar
geted variants enabled in vivo imaging in a metastatic tumor 
model. We hypothesized mAbconjugated variants could pro
vide a real time, quantitative approach to determine the site and 
extent of ADC linker cleavage in complex model organisms.
