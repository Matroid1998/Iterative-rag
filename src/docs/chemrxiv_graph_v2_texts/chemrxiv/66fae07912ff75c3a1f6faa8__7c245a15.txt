Description:
Consists of stacked layers of graphene.

Text:
Unlike its parent material, graphite, which consists of stacked layers of graphene, monolayer graphene
exhibits superior properties such as high electron mobility, exceptional tensile strength, and excellent thermal
conductivity. These characteristics make graphene a promising candidate for various advanced technologies. However, challenges remain regarding the scalable and costeffective production of highquality graphene, leading
to the development of several synthesis methods such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and electrochemical
exfoliation 38. 2
