Description:
The most electronegative and least polarizable halogen atom, capable of forming halogen bond interactions in gaseous and solid states.

Text:
This stems from the fact that the 
strength of a halogen bond is closely related to the 
polarizability and electronegativity of the halogen atom 
employed13, as well as the strength of the halogen bond it 
forms, which follows the order I  Br  Cl7a, 14. For this 
reason, convention dictates that the most electronegative 
and least polarizable fluorine atom is not ordinarily 
expected to generate the essential hole associated with 
efficient halogen bonding1a, 15. Interestingly however, 
Politzer et al.16 and others17 have demonstrated through 
computer simulations and crystallography that fluorine can 
form halogen bond interactions in both the gaseous and 
solid states (Figure 1b). Additionally, Baxter et al. reported 
experimental and computational evidence of nitrogen
fluorine halogen bonding in Ag(I)initiated radical CH 
fluorinations (Figure 1c)18.
