Description:
Contains metal ions as inorganic nodes.

Text:
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline materials built from inorganic nodes and rigid 
multitopic organic linkers using reticular chemistry.1,2 The combination of the structural rigidity and 
directional coordination of the inorganic nodes, which can be either metal ions (e.g. in ZIF8) or 
polynuclear clusters (e.g. in UiO66 or MOF5), with the rigid linkers determining the possible architectures 
of the resulting MOF.
