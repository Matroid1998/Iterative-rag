Description:
Has the highest solubility value of all 3d transition metal ions in wZnO at 0.1 GPa and 1100 K.

Equilibrium Tx phase diagram of the 
FeOZnO system was previously studied at ambient pressure 19. Like other MeOZnO systems, 
this system is characterized by a large (1880 mol ZnO at 1100 K) area of coexistence of 
wurtzite and rocksalt solid solutions. At 0.1 GPa and 1100 K, the Mn2 solubility in wZnO reaches 
25 mol 17, which is the highest solubility value of all 3d transition metal ions. At the same time, 
Zn2 solubility in rsMnO is not more than 9 mol, which is the lowest solubility of Zn2 among 3d 
transition metal monoxides with rocksalt structure 17.
