Description:
Compounds that suffer from low molar extinction coefficients in the red spectral region, resulting in slow and inefficient photoswitching.

The last decade has witnessed major efforts to 
overcome these limits, primarily through tetraorthosubstitutions 
and cyclic azobenzenes.810 However, both approaches suffer from 
low molar extinction coefficients in the bettertissuepenetrating red 
spectral region, resulting in slow and inefficient photoswitching; true 
NIR response is lacking; and both methods require redesigning the 
photoswitch, which restricts their scope and can result in dramatic 
losses of potency (for further background, see Supporting Note 1). Two alternative routes to photocontrol azobenzene isomer ratios, 
with high switching completion and efficient redNIR response, 
recently emerged in materials sciences photoredox catalysis1114, 
which we address in this work, and triplet energy transfer11,1518, 
which we address in a parallel manuscript19.
