Description:
A material suitable for emerging applications due to its isoergic or slightly endergonic singlet fission (SF).

Text:
Conversely, materials 
82 
that feature isoergic or slightly endergonic SF, such as 
83 
tetracene, are suitable for emerging applications.42,43 
84 
Notably, if SF is isoergic, dissociation of the correlated 
85 
triplet pair into free triplet excited states may be hindered 
86 
by thermally activated triplettriplet annihilation up
87 
conversion (TTAUC), a competitive process that yields a 
88 
higherlying singlet excited state.44,45,46,47 
89 
TTAUC is the reverse process to SF and involves the 
90 
fusion of two lowenergy triplet excited states to provide 
91 
one highenergy singlet excited state.48,49,50,51 For TTAUC to 
92 
occur, the energy of the singlet excited state of the 
93 
annihilator must be lower than twice the energy of the 
94 
triplet excited state.

Based on this parameter, polycyclic

aromatic 
hydrocarbons, 
including 
anthracene,52,53,54 
96 
tetracene,55,56,57 perylene,58,59,60 and their derivatives have 
97 
been explored as annihilators in combination with triplet 
98 
sensitizers 
that 
undergo 
photoexcitation 
at 
long

wavelengths. TTAUC is typically a diffusioncontrolled, 
100 
bimolecular 
process, 
and 
photosensitized 
TTAUC 
101 
measurements are typically conducted in the high
102 
concentration regime. Seminal work on TTAUC using 
103 
dimeric and oligomeric annihilators confirms that 
104 
intramolecular TTAUC (intraTTAUC) helps to circumvent 
105 
the need for high concentrations.54,55,57,61 On the other hand, 
106 
a definitive scheme describing the process of intraTTAUC 
107 
and how it affects the efficiency of TTAUC is still lacking. 108 
Intramolecular SF (intraSF) in molecular dimers and 
109 
oligomers is at the forefront of recent investigations of this 
110 
process.
