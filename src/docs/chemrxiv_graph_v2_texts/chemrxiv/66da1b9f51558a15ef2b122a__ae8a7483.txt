Description:
A chemically inert noble metal useful as an electrode material because it is not easily corroded and is mechanically robust.

Over the past decade, the field of synthetic organic electrochemistry has expanded 
dramatically due to new realms of reactivity that it enables as well as sustainable 
alternatives to known transformations.14 Electrochemistry is particularly attractive 
due to the lowcost and ease with which reactions can be scaled up as electrons are 
often the primary reagent. In terms of reaction design, the finetuning of reactivity 
can be achieved by modulated parameters such as electrolyte, solvent, catalyst, 
current, and potential.5 Since electron transfer occurs at an electrode interface, the 
choice of electrode material is one of the most influential parameters to consider 
(Figure 1A).6,7 Chemically inert electrodes, such as noble metals (e.g. platinum), are 
particularly useful because they are not easily corroded and mechanically robust.
