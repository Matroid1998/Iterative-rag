Description:
A dimeric MRTADF emitter with photoluminescence redshifted to 470 nm in toluene.

Text:
Our group reported 
the first example of a dimeric MRTADF emitter by connecting two DiKTa units (aka QAO or 
QAD)2123 through a single bond in DDiKTa (Scheme S1).24 The photoluminescence (PL) was 
observed to redshift from 451 nm for DiKTa to 470 nm for DDiKTa in toluene. Yasuda and co
workers reported another two isomeric MRTADF dimers formed by tethering two MRTADF 
fragments with different regiochemistry, paraBpB for pCzB and paraNpN for mCzB, as 
shown in Scheme S1.25 Compared to DtBuCzB (lPL  489 nm), pCzB and mCzB emit at 504 
and 515 nm in toluene, representing a modest redshift of their PL.26 The devices with pCzB and 
mCzB showed EQEmax of 20.2 and 23.5, respectively.
