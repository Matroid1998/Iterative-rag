Description:
A versatile electroactive organic molecule known for its remarkable redox properties and use in molecular conductors.

Text:
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and its numerous derivatives are 
among the most versatile electroactive organic molecules due 
to their remarkable redox properties, their use as building 
blocks for the development of molecular conductors, and 
diverse applications in organic electronics.1,2 TTF derivatives 
have also been widely explored as molecular switches, sensors, 
rectifiers, transistors, and for nonlinear optics, among other 
uses.37 More recently and since the pioneering study reporting 
the palladiumcatalysed direct CH arylation,8 tetraarylated 
TTFs have been employed for the construction of functional 
porous frameworks9 such as MetalOrganic Frameworks 
(MOFs),1012 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)13,14 or 
Hydrogenbonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs).15,16 However, 
direct CH arylation has been limited to TTF derivatives,17 and 
the catalytic peripheral modification of other extended TTF 
cores is encouraged for the construction of electroactive 
frameworks exhibiting new electronic properties and functions.
