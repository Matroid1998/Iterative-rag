Description:
A ligand denoted as 'en' in the Pd(en)2 complex.

Text:
M6L4 squarebased pyramid (SP) consisting of tritopic ligand 1 and 
Pd(en)2 (en ethylenediamine) is a bowlshaped structure 
assembled in D2O originally reported by Fujita and coworkers.72 In the 
course of our mechanistic study of the selfassembly process of the 
M6L4 SP, it was found that the selfassembly of tritopic ligand 1 and 
cisprotected PdPy22 complex (Pd Pd(TMEDA), Py 3
chloropyridine) in organic solvent at relatively low concentration gave 
a mixture of the Pd2124 open structure, the Pd61412 SP, and 
uncharacterized species under thermodynamic control.73 The 
Pd61412 SP is a dimerized structure of Pd2124 connected by two 
Pd2 complexes (Fig. 1).
