Description:
A modified 6Aza Uracil derivative studied for its photophysical properties and tautomerization behavior.

With this objective in mind, our research group chose to investigate a modified 6Aza 
Uracil derivative known as 5(thiophen2yl)6Aza uracil (TAU)13. During our study of its 
photophysical properties in aqueous solution, we observed 3enol5enol tautomerization 
that affects the photophysical properties of the diketo tautomer of TAU that we are interested in 
using for further spectroscopic experiments13. To address this, we decided to add a methyl group 
to the nitrogen at position N4, aiming to prevent tautomerization and thereby better analyze 
the photophysical characteristics of this molecule. The purpose is to investigate whether 
introducing a methyl group can serve as a practical and effective method to prevent the 3enol5
enol tautomerization of TAU using theoretical calculations and steadystate experiments.
