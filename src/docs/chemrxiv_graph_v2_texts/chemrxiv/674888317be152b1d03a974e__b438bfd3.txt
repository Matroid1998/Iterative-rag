Description:
A nonsymmetric helicene obtained in 53% yield over three steps from stilbene 1b.

Text:
A 
further elaboration of the products to longer helicenes was 
possible via a Mallorycross couplingMallory sequence that 
afforded, for example, nonsymmetric di(thieno)6helicene 4b 
in 53 yield over three steps from stilbene 1b (Figure 1). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024cgnhqv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000170826201 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
