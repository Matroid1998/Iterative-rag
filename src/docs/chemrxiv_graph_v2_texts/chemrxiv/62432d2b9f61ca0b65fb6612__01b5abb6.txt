Description:
A well-studied binary compound widely used as an abrasive.

Text:
Whereas SiC is a rather wellstudied binary compound that is widely used as an abrasive 1, 
ternary compounds of the SiCN system are illstudied. In 1965, equiatomic SiCN was reported as made by SiC crystals grown in nitrogen atmosphere 2. The stated structure shown in Fig. 1a is a cubic fluoritelike one with face centered Si substructure, 
and C and N atoms occupying the fluorite F8 cube corners. Later, Chen et al. 3 identified 
crystalline and amorphous SiCN in the process of thin films growth by microwave CVD; but no 
crystal structure was reported.
