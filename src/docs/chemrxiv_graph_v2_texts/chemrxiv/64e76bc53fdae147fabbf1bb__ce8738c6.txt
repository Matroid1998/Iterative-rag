Description:
A valence isoelectronic ion with 4f3 electron configuration.

Text:
The latter are chosen because they are all Kramers 
ions and hence are expected to be EPRactive; (ii) 
comparison with the late Ln3 complex Yb(Cp)3;20 
(iii) comparision of 1Ln with the early An3 
homologues 1An.16 The latter includes direct 
comparison of the valence isoelectronic Nd3 (4f3) and 
U3 (5f3) pair, which is the only comparison available 
between 4f and 5f M3 ions that does not require 
designated radiochemical laboratories (although Ce3 
and Th3 have the same number of valence electrons,
