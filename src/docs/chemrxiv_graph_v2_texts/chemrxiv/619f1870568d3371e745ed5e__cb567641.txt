Description:
An electroactive group used as a single electronic active state in tunneling mechanisms.

Text:
Tunneling mechanism can be modelled 
based on various suppositions, while the most commonly 
used is single level model (SLM) in both experimental and 
theoretical studies. In this model, single electroactive state 
is sandwiched between two electrodes with energy level 
offset to the Fermi level of the electrodes and electronic 
coupling to the electronic states of the electrode (figure 1). Experimentally single state junction has been achieved by 
attaching electroactive group like ferrocene or conjugate 
organic molecules as the single electronic active state with 
alkane molecule as insert molecular linker to adjust the 
coupling of the electronic state with electrode.
