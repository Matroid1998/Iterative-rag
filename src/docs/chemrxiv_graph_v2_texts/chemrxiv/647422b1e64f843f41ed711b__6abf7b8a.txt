Valleriite (Fe3,Cu)S2x(Mg,Fe,Al)(OH)2 
occurs in large amounts in the Norilsk CuNi ore provenance 2628, largely in socalled cuprous 
ores, which remain uninvolved in industrial processing because of, among other reasons, poor 
understanding its structure and properties. Recently, we developed a hydrothermal method for manufacturing almost impurityfree 
flakes of 10200 nm in lateral size and 1020 nm thick of synthetic valleriite 29 and tochilinite 
30, including doped with Al, Li, 3d metals, and examined some of their main characteristics 
using XRD, TEM, EDS, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), reflection electron energy loss 
spectroscopy, Mssbauer, Raman and UVvisNIR spectroscopies, together with magnetization, 
impedance, zeta potential and other measurements 3132.

Description:
A compound studied for its stability and reactions at temperatures up to 1000Â°C.

Text:
Few previous studies mentioned temperature effects in the formation 
and stability of valleriite 3233 have been performed with the samples contained less than 50 
of the target substance. The goal of the current research was to elucidate stability ranges and 
reactions of valleriite, including doped with Al and Li, at temperatures up to 1000 oC by 
thermogravimetry (TG, DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under inert and 
oxidizing conditions. We have also employed XPS, XRD, SEM, and TEM to characterize the 
initial materials and the final products. The results were compared with the DTA data available in 
the literature for bulk brucite, chalcopyrite, and layered double hydroxides to gain insights into 
mechanisms behind specific behavior and mutual influence of the 2D sulfide and hydroxide layers.
