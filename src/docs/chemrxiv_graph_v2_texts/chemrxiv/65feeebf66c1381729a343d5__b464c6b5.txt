23 Indeed, since then the PAAmBAC system has 
been routinely used to prepare degradable andor reversible hydrogels for electrophoresis 24,25 
as well as various systems for biomedical applications. 2628 For example, Aliyar et al. 29 
prepared reversible PAAmBAC hydrogels for optical lens applications that could be degraded 
and reformed by thioldisulfide exchange. Yang et al. 30 reported that alginatePAAm adhesive 
hydrogels with disulfide crosslinks are degraded by cysteine under physiological conditions. Tibbitt et al. 31 synthesized a polyacrylate hydrogel consisting of a monoacrylated 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEGA) monomer and a photolabile, diacrylate crosslinker by FRP. Degradation of these hydrogels was possible by photocleavage of the crosslinker after exposing 
the hydrogel to UV light.
