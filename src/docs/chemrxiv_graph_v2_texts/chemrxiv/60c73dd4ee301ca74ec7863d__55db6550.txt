Description:
A material that can be exfoliated to produce single-layer graphene.

Text:
As a result, a variety of scalable production methods have been developed to overcome the low 
throughput of the original micromechanical exfoliation of graphite layers down to singlelayer 
graphene, including chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in low 
surface energy solvents 2. Such a variety led to the rise of a whole family of graphenebased 2D 
materials (GBMs), exhibiting various structural and physicochemical properties 5,6.
