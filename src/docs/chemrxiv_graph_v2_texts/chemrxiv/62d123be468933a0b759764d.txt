. Driven by environmental and economic requirements, the modern photoredox mediated chemical 
synthesis of organic molecules has emerged as a truly powerful trend for the development of new, 
chemoselective, and efficient methods toward carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom bonds 
constructions. In this regard, the advancement of photoredox mediated chemistry of carbocylic acids 
(1) has had an enormous impact on enabling new chemical reactions and has extended the scope of 
accessible molecular scaffolds (Figures 1AB). These reactions are particularly attractive because, 
owing to the wide availability of carboxylic acids in natural products, bioactivecompounds and drug
molecules, these visiblelight transformations of carboxylic acids can be used as latestage 
transformations for building new libraries of these important compounds in mild reaction 
conditions. Ahmad Masarwa
