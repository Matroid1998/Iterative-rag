Description:
Synthetic molecules used in creating coarse-grained molecular models.

Text:
This offers a relative 
transferability of the FF, which is useful to create CG molecular models for various types of molecules, 
from biomolecules such as lipids,3234 peptides and proteins,35,36 to synthetic molecules such as 
polymers,37,38 fullerenes,39,40 etc. In the MARTINI scheme, building an adequate CG model for a molecule of interest requires to map the 
constitutive molecular fragments in the AA model to CG beads, which types are opportunely chosen based 
on chemical analogy and polarities of the groups, setting up the nonbonded interactions in the CG model. The nonbonded parameters can then be refined to obtain accurate pairwise interactions between the 
molecular species in the system.
