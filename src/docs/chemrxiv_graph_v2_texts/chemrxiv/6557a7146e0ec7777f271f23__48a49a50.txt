quence of orbital interactions and is inseparable from chem
ical bonding. 911 The beststudied topological materials
studied to date are made of main group elements, such as the
tetradymite family of topological insulators that includes
Bi2Se3, and the topological crystalline insulator SnTe. 1214
The bonding interactions that create the topological states
in these materials are therefore limited to what can be done
with s and p valence orbitals.
