Description:
Allows precise bandgap tuning in a continuous range as large as 360 meV when curvature is induced.

The use of curved supports for inducing local strain is well established for generating exotic 
properties from conventional layered materials1. An excellent example is graphene, which already 
exhibits remarkable properties in its planar configuration. Straining graphene can modify its 
electronic structure to create polarized carrier puddles, induce pseudomagnetic fields, and alter 
surface properties2. In MoS2, modifying the supporting glass sphere diameter induces curvature in 
the MoS2, which permits precise bandgap tuning of MoS2 in a continuous range as large as 360 
meV3. Curved MoS2 conformally coated on Au nanocone arrays is a promising catalyst for the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The improved HER activity is attributed to sulfurvacancies 
and reduction of the bandgap under strain4.
