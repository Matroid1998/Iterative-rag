Description:
A surface used in studies of energy transfer involving NH3 scattering.

Text:
To this end, several experimental
and complementary theoretical studies have been performed
to understand the nature of energy transfer in diatomsurface
collisions.810 In contrast, there have been only a few experi
mental studies that investigated energy transfer in polyatomic
molecules scattering from surfaces.1114 The study involving
NH3 scattering from Au(111) surface, was supported by clas
sical trajectory simulations, where they nd a high propensity
for rotationally cold NH3 molecules to be scattered into lowk
states (tumbling rather than twirling). The rotational rainbow
was attributed to dynamical steering effect, where the rota
tionally cold NH3 molecules had enough time to reorient it
self in a particular orientation due to the nature of interaction
potential, before the collision.
