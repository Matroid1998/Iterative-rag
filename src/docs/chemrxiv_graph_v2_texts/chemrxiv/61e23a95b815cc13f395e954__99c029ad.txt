During any stage of winemaking, storage, and transport, oxidation has always been a major issue for winemakers 
21 
and consumers alike. Multiple previous studies have shown that oxygen can alter the aroma profile of wines 
22 
through an array of mechanisms, such as the quinonerelated reactions12 and the production of various carbonyl 
23 
compounds using hydroxyl free radicals as intermediates (the Fenton Reaction)24.
