Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, released in large quantities by human activities.

The escalating levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has caused the earths 
temperature to rise by approximately 1.2o C during the last five decades.1 Currently, human activities release about 40 billion 
tons of CO2 every year.2 According to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPPC), the CO2 emissions would need 
to be reduced to 20 billion tons per year to limit warming to 1.5o C compared to the preindustrial levels.3 Industrial point sources 
such as coal, natural gas, and cement industries which contain CO2 in the range of 420  account for more than half of the 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions.4,5 Effective technologies that can remove CO2 both from industrial sources and directly from 
the atmosphere are high in demand because the transition to renewable energy alone may be too slow in order to meet climate 
goals.46 
The general requirements for an efficient carbon capture technology include high sorption capacity, low energy consumption, 
high selectivity for CO2 over other gases in the mixture, facile reversibility of adsorption, fast sorption kinetics, and the use of 
robust, longliving, and inexpensive materials.7,8 To date, the most widely used technology for CO2 capture is amine scrubbing, 
which requires the use of corrosive, volatile, and toxic solvents.9,10 Alternative technologies for carbon capture include 
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and temperature swing adsorption (TSA) on porous sorbents such as zeolites and porous 
carbons.
