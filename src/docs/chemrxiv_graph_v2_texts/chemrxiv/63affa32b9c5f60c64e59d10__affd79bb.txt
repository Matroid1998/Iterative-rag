Description:
Formed after complete lithium removal during delithiation.

The general 
understanding on the lithiationdelithiation of Si anode can be summarized as follows 
(1) During lithiation, cSi phase transforms into amorphous LixSi (aLixSi) phase, and finally 
converts into cLi15Si4 phase at low voltages around 50 mV vs LiLi.911 There are two 
clear voltage plateaus at around 0.18 and 0.05 V vs LiLi.12 
(2) During delithiation, the cLi15Si4 phase converts back to aLixSi phase, and then aSi is 
formed after complete lithium removal.
