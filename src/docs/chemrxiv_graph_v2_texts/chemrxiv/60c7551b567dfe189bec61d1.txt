Description:
A compound whose selectivity is correlated with catalyst activity in vanadium-based oxidation reactions.

Text:
We start from 
a consistent experimental set of clean data, containing nine 
vanadiumbased oxidation catalysts (Fig. 1A). Here, the term 
clean data refers to the fact that these materials were carefully 
synthesized and tested in catalysis according to standardized 
protocols. 12 Importantly, these nine catalysts were also 
characterized in detail, resulting in more than forty measured 
properties per material. To this data set, we applied the 
compressedsensing symbolicregression sureindependence
screeningandsparsifyingoperator (SISSO)
13, 14 approach (Fig. 1B). We thus identified the few most relevant parameters that are 
correlated, in a possibly complicated way, with the selectivity 
towards acrylic acid and with catalyst activity.
