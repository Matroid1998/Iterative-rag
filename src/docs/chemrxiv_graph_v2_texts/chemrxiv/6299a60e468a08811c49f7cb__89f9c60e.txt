Description:
Has good optical transmission characteristics in the UV-visible region and absorption in the mid-IR spectral window.

According to the StefanBoltzmann law, the
total radiant power emitted from a surface is proportional to T 4
while the maximum wavelength of emission is blueshifted with
temperature 1T (Wiens law). Currently used IR thermal radiation sources can be heated up
to nearly 600C, way above polyimides limit. Therefore, it is de
sirable to realize a light source which can be used even at such
high temperatures at which emission is more intense. Naturally,
the use of inorganic materials or organicinorganic hybrids is an
excellent way to improve the heat resistance of the MIM metasur
face. For example, SiO2, which has a good optical transmission
characteristics in the UVvisible region, has an absorption in the
midIR spectral window. In the case of thick glass, it is well known
