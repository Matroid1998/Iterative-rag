Description:
Modified NIR fluorescent dyes applied in biological studies.

Fluorescent materials are important building blocks in many applications. For example, they 
can be used as labels or sensors for biological samples. In particular, nearinfrared (NIR) 
fluorescence offers several advantages for the study of biological systems1,2. Many 
biomolecules show autofluorescence, which can interfere with a specific fluorescence signature. In the NIR, this autofluorescence is significantly reduced. Absorption and scattering of radiation 
in the NIR are also significantly lower compared to visible light2. Therefore, signals in the 
NIR have higher tissue penetration, resulting in better signaltonoise ratios and substantially 
lower phototoxicity1. Organic NIR fluorescent dyes such as cyanines3,4 and modified boron 
dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs)5,6 have been successfully applied for a number of biological 
studies, but they may have disadvantages such as fast bleaching, low quantum yield or 
biocompatibility.
