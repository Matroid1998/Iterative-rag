Description:
Sulfonamide analogs that have gained substantial momentum in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Sulfonamides are indispensable in medicinal chemistry. 25  of all FDAapproved new molecular entities from the 
first half of 2022 contained a sulfonamide motif.1 Moreover, 
sulfonamide analogs, especially the O to NR exchanged 
sulfonimidamides (see Fig. 1) and sulfoximines, have gained 
substantial momentum13 and first successful examples 
show the potential of these modalities.47 Notably, the new 
exit vector enabled by sulfonimidamides may open unprec
edented opportunities for structurebased design of sulfon
amide analogs, but structurally welldocumented examples 
for this are still lacking. 1 www.accessdata.fda.govscriptscderdafindex.cfm?eventreports
