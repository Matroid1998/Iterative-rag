Description:
Manganese-based oxides are used as cathodes in alkali-metal ion batteries and electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.

The interesting redox chemistry of manganese (Mn), its high 
abundancy in Earths crust and its known properties in electron 
transfer processes make manganesebased materials like its 
oxides, nitrides or the sulfides suitable for a broad range of 
applications. Especially, when applied as thin films, these 
materials can function in a variety of applications that includes 
amongst others, cathodes in alkalimetal ion batteries1, 
electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER)2 or dilute 
magnetic semiconductors (DMS) in spintronics3. When utilized 
as a thin film, the quality and functionality of Mnbased layered 
materials are strongly dependent on the deposition method. While 
several deposition methods have been used for growing thin films 
of Mnbased materials such as solution based methods (e.g. dip
coating4, 
solgel5, 
electrodeposition6) 
physical 
vapor 
deposition (e.g.
