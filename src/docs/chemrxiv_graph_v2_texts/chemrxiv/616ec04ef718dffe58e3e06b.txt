Description:
An agonist required for the function of the NMDA receptor.

Text:
Dserine is a physiological coagonist of the Nmethyl Daspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor, a key 
excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain. DSerine in the brain is synthesized from its Lisomer by serine 
racemase and is metabolized by the Damino acid oxidase (DAO, DAAO), a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the 
oxidative degradation of Damino acids including Dserine to the corresponding keto acids. The function of the 
NMDA receptor requires the presence of both the agonist (glutamate) and the coagonist (Dserine, glycine, andor 
Dalanine).
