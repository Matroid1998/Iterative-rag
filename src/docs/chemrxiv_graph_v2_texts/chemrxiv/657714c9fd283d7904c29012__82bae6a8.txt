Description:
Isosteres of thioamides in peptide and protein backbones.

Text:
Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of oxoamides in 
peptide and protein backbones and their properties have been 
explored extensively in organic and medicinal chemistry, leading 
to FDA approved drugs contain thiocarbonyls such as 
propylthiouracil and thiamazole used for the treatment of 
hyperthyroidism in various diseases,1 and the antibiotics 
etionamide and protionamide used for the treatment of 
tuberculosis.2 At the same time, thioamides have been used as 
key intermediates for the synthesis of various heterocycles and 
for latestage functionalization of peptides. Thioamides are also 
found in natural products such as the thionated nucleosides 2
thiouridine 
and 
4thiouridine,3 
cycasthioamide4 
the 
polythioamide closthioamide, isolated from the anaerobic 
bacterium Clostridium cellulolyctium,5 and peptides such as 
thioviridamide6 (Scheme 1).

Description:
Weaker hydrogen bond donors but stronger hydrogen bond acceptors compared to thioamides.

Text:
This, in turn, leads to a slightly shorter CN 
bond (1.35  vs 1.37 )9 (Table 1) and an increased rotational 
barrier around the CN bond.10 As a consequence, thioamides 
are considered stronger hydrogen bond donors but weaker 
hydrogen bond acceptors compared to their corresponding 
oxoamides (Table 1), partly due to reduced polarity and solvation 
by water.11 The effect of substituting an oxoamide for a thioamide 
within an ahelical peptide or protein, causes the hydrogen bond 
distance to increase from 2.1  to 2.7 , which distorts the 
torsional angles of the backbone and increases the pitch per 
turn.12
