Ubiquitous in synthetic drugs, biologically active natural compounds, and pharmaceuticals.

Text:
Tetrahydroisoquinolines are ubiquitous in synthetic drugs, 
biologically active natural compounds and pharmaceuticals.1 
Derivatives containing a butenolide moiety at C1, turned out to 
be highly active against human stomach cancer and ovarian 
cancer cells (Figure 1a).2 Furthermore, a wide variety of 1
substituted derivatives of Narylated tetrahydroisoquinolines are 
core structures in compounds with high pharmacological 
activity.3 
Moreover, 
tetrahydroisoquinolinebutanolides, 
accessible via hydrogenation of the butenolide moiety, act on the 
human central nervous system (Figure 1a).4

butenolides2 and tetrahydroisoquinolinebutanolide.4 b) and c) Survey of the 
visible lightdriven synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinolinebutenolides previous5
