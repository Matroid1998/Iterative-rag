Description:
Prepared by iterative lithiation and silylation of Mn(CO)3(C5Br5).

Text:
So far, only one transition metal complex with a pentakis(dimethylsilyl) substituted Cp ligand is known 
in the literature. Snkel and Hofmann prepared Mn(CO)3(C5DMS5) by iterative lithiation and silylation 
of Mn(CO)3(C5Br5) (Scheme 1, top).25 Although the preparation of C5DMS5 by reaction of 
C5DMS6 with MeLi has been reported26 it has never been used for followup chemistry. Here, the 
corresponding C5DMS6 was prepared by reaction of C5Br6 with Mg and DMSCl. Claims in the Russian 
literature regarding the preparation of C5TMS627 were not reproducible. In contrast, the synthesis of 
C5TMS3H2 is well established and the ligand is easily coordinated in reactions with metal halides.28
31 However, the synthetic challenge becomes more demanding for metallocenes due to repulsion of the 
sterically crowded Cp ligands in the sandwich structure.
