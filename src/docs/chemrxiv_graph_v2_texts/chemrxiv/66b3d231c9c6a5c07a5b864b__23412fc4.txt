Description:
Residual compounds produced during the cracking of naphtha.

. The production of paraffins and olefins is one of the most farreaching industrial processes 
performed today, with global ethylene production exceeding 150 million tons per year.1 Production 
is primarily performed by cracking naphtha to produce light olefins, hydrogen byproduct, and 
residual paraffins, resulting in a complex mixture that must be purified.1 Purities of at least 95 
are needed for commodity chemical applications and 99.5 for polyolefin production.2 Cryogenic 
distillation is the current state of the art to achieve such high purities, but it is a highly energy
intensive process because temperatures as low as 160 C are required.
