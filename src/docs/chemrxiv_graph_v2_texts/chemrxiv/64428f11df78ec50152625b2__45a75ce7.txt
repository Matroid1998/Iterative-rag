Description:
An SEI component with high mechanical strength and good ion transport properties.

Carbonatebased 
(e.g., ethylene carbonate dimethyl carbonate, ECDMC) electrolytes have achieved 
great success due to their excellent Li transport property and good stability, which have 
become the mainstream commercial electrolytes.79 However, the SEI formed with 
carbonatebased electrolytes is mainly composed of carbonate ionic phase (e.g., lithium 
carbonate, Li2CO3), organic lithium compounds (e.g., lithium ethylene decarbonate), 
and other organic species, which usually has poor stability.1012 
To improve the properties of the electrodeelectrolyte interphases, in particular, 
the anode surface, a widely used strategy is to add one or multiple electrolyte additives 
to form stable artificial SEI compositions that could suppress further side reactions 
between the electrolyte and anode as well as the growth of the notorious lithium 
dendrites.13, 14 For instance, fluorinated carbonates (e.g., fluoroethylene carbonate, FEC) 
are widely used as electrolyte additives, which could produce LiF (an SEI component 
with high mechanical strength and good ion transport properties) on the lithium metal 
anode surface.1517 While tremendous previous reports have demonstrated that addition
