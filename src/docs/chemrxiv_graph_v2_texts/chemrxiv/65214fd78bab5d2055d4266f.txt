Description:
Used in solid phase adsorption to remove radioactive iodine.

Text:
Current methods for removing radioactive iodine from different industrial waste 
streams include wet scrubbing (using alkaline solutions like NaOH or Hg(NO3)2 as well 
as solid phase adsorption (using silver salts, zeolites, minerals containing bismuth 
oxyiodide, activated carbon and others).9,10 However, these methods have drawbacks 
such as the need for complex equipment, hazardous byproduct generation, poor 
absorption capacities, and high cost because of the need for expensive sorbents.7,1113 
For these reasons, the development of alternative, chemically stable materials that can 
collect iodine at low concentrations in aqueous environments, remains a key challenge. To address this problem, researchers have begun to explore the vast library of porous 
organic materials as highperformance adsorbents for iodine pollution.
