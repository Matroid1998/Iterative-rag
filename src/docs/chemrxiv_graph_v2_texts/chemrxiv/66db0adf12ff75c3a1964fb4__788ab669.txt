Description:
Used as an atomically smooth substrate to facilitate the growth of 2D UiO66NH2 films.

Text:
As a result, the stateoftheart UiO66 films are 23 orders of magnitude thicker than the desired 2D film (Figure S2 and 
Table S1). Herein, we report the first nonvdW 2D MOF in the form of 2D UiO66NH2 film by developing conditions leading to anisotropic 
2D growth. Briefly, the composition of the precursor solution was screened to develop growth conditions that delay homogeneous 
nucleation of UiO66NH2 in the bulk solution, promote inplane growth of 2D nuclei, and slow outofplane growth. This was further 
facilitated by the use of atomically smooth graphitic substrates. A crystallographic registry between the graphene superstructure and 
the 2D lattice of UiO66 along the aoutofplane direction was observed. The thickness of the film could be tuned from 0.5 to 2 unit 
cells.
