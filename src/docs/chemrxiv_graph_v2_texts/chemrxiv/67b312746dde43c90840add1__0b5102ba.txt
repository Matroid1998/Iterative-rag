Description:
Ion intermediates detected using infrared ion spectroscopy and cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy.

The use of substituents remote from a reaction centre to influ
ence the stereochemical outcome of reactions is widespread in 
chemistry.17 In the case of reactions proposed to proceed via 
oxacarbenium ions, this has been the subject of many studies.8
16 The role of esters as remote substituents in stereoselective 
glycosylations has been the topic of much controversy and de
bate, especially in relation to 4Oestermediated synthesis of 
biologically important 1,2cisgalactosides and fucosides 
(Figure 1).1728 Flowers first proposed that longrange partici
pation, whereby the axial 4Oester of a fucosyl donor forms a 
dioxolenium ion intermediate analogous to 1 with an inaccessi
ble face, could explain the high 1,2cisselectivity observed 
in fucosylations when benzoates were placed at the 4posi
tion.17,18 Many studies have since invoked this intermediate to 
rationalize 
stereoselective 
1,2cisgalactosylations 
and 
fucosylations.19,2123,2628 Computational studies have been used 
to support this hypothesis and, indeed, dioxolenium ions have 
been detected experimentally using infrared ion spectroscopy 
and cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy.22,23,29,30 However, these 
conditions are not representative of experimental conditions in 
the solution phase.

Description:
An ion intermediate that has been debated in terms of its role in stereoselectivity and electrostatic stabilization.

Text:
Conversely, Woerpel, Crich and others have 
advocated for the hypothesis that throughspace electrostatic 
stabilization of ion pairs 2 could explain the high stereoselec
tivity observed.13,25,31 Crich and coworkers have provided sig
nificant experimental evidence against dioxolenium ion inter
mediates for 4Oesters,25,32,33 and concluded that the evidence 
supports this alternative electrostatic stabilization hypothesis. They have rationalized selectivities reported elsewhere under 
their theory (e.g., more electronrich 4Opivalates give higher 
selectivity than 4Oacetates because they can better stabilize 
the partial positive charge on the anomeric carbon).

Description:
A borderline phenomenon detectable in galactosylations but not crucial to stereoinduction.

Text:
Crich con
cluded that formation of a dioxolenium ion was a borderline 
phenomenon that, although detectable, was not crucial to stere
oinduction in galactosylations directed by 4Oesters.25 
Under either of the above theories, the addition of electrondo
nating groups to the ester would be expected to improve stere
oselectivity, while electronwithdrawing groups would be ex
pected to be detrimental to selectivity. Herein we report obser
vation of an unexpected trend in studies of 1,2cisgalactosyla
tions, wherein high selectivity is observed using an electron
withdrawing paranitrobenzoate ester at position 4.34
