Description:
A semiconducting phase with a predominantly exposed basal plane that is catalytically inactive without defects.

The most important TMD is MoS2, which
has attracted great interest as a lowcost and environmentally
friendly electrocatalyst for HER mechanism1113. Furthermore,
MoS2 catalysts are already produced on large scales for hydro
treatment and hydrocracking reactions for oil rening. In general, the activity of the catalyst depends mainly on the to
tal number of active sites and on their intrinsic activity. For pris
tine MoS2, both theoretical calculations and subsequent experi
mental results have shown that promising sites are generally con
ned to the small region of exposed edges14. The predominantly
exposed basal plane of the semiconducting 2HMoS2 phase is,
however, catalytically inactive in the absence of defects13,15.
