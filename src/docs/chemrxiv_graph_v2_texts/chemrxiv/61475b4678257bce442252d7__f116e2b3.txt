Description:
Used in labeling water to distinguish hydride stretching modes.

Text:
For multifunctional substrates, linear IR
and Raman spectroscopy can provide an immediate survey over competing hydrogen bond dock
ing sites due to the simplicity and intensity of the vibrational ngerprint of the OH group13,14. Double resonance techniques allow for rigorous size and conformational distinction15, relaxation
experiments can identify the most stable conformation16, and 18O labelling of water can un
ambiguously discriminate from other hydride stretching modes in the vicinity17. The spectral
position of the OH stretching vibration is very sensitive to the strength of the hydrogen bond,
spanning about two orders of magnitude in relation to the typical spectral width of an isolated
vibrational transition.
