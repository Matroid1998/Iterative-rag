Description:
A zeolite used as a selective oxidation catalyst, particularly in olefin epoxidation.

Text:
Titanium silicalite1 (TS1) zeolite 1 is an 
important functional material that has been used for the 
past decades as a selective oxidation catalyst, e.g. in 
olefin epoxidation 2. While preserving the MFI type 
structure that ensures its remarkable activity, it is 
desirable to design new TS1 based catalysts for 
specific 
catalytic 
applications 
and 
reactor 
configurations. On the one hand, catalytic performance is strongly 
limited by the slow diffusion of reactants and products 
in the micropores of the zeolite 36. In some cases, 
the molecules cannot enter the microporosity and are 
thus restrained to the external surface. Therefore, 
strategies are put in place to enhance the surfaceto
volume ratio of the catalyst, i.e.
