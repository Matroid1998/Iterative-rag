Description:
A material whose optical response in the visible range is modified by tetravalent doping atoms.

Text:
of tetravalent doping 
atoms (Zr, Ti, Sn and Si) significantly modifies the optical response of CeO2 in the visible range by shifting the 
absorption edge which also effects on the refractive index of the material. For these systems, the water contact 
angle has been computed through adsorption energy of water layers. We report the intrinsic hydrophilicity of the 
lowindex surfaces of CeO2, which is enhanced by introduction of the impurity atom. Influence of the dopants on 
the oxygen vacancy formation energy () is considered and discussed with respect to its possible effect on the 
hydrophobic behavior of CeO2.

Used in the glass industry as a transparent layer.

Text:
It is found out that all the considered doping atoms reduce () , resulting in 
enhanced adsorption of the air hydrocarbons at the surface, which leads to an increased water contact angle. Based 
on the obtained results, an assessment on the applicability of doped CeO2 in glass industry is made. It is concluded 
that Zrdoped CeO2 possesses the most prominent properties among considered systems for the application as 
transparent layer. Keywords
