Heightened anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the development of processes to mitigate CO2 
emissions associated with climate change.1,2 Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is being pursued as one solution 
towards a carbonneutral economy.3,4 However, many challenges remain, including those associated with selectivity 
for multicarbon fuel candidates. Current trends focus on coppers crucial ability to form appreciable quantities of 
carboncoupled products.

Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical reduction requiring two proton and electron transfers.

Text:
As yet it is not possible to reliably tune the downstream C2 products produced, such as 
ethylene and ethanol, and the mechanisms defining such selectivities are not firmly established (Scheme 1).5 Even 
on a planar catalyst, perhaps the simplest practical system for mechanistic studies, there are many effects to consider, 
including, but not limited to concentration polarization effects from dissolved CO2, intermediates, electrolytes, 
fluctuations in local pH, and the faceting and restructuring of the electrode surface.6

Scheme 1 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO requires two proton and electron transfers. Reduction of CO is proposed to be the rate
determining step for producing carboncoupled products, but the exact species it is reduced to upon dimerization are still under 
investigation.5
