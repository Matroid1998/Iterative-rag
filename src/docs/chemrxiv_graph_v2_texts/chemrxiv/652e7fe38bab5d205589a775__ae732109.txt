Description:
Transfers an electron to styrene leading to intermediates of the direct pathway.

Text:
also contains examples which were successfully 
converted without a mediator present. The mechanism of styrene hydrogenation is believed to 
start by cathodic reduction of 27 and subsequent protonation 
delivering a benzylic radical which undergoes the same process 
again to furnish products 28 (Scheme 3c).27,33 The difference in 
Qius concept is that the radical anion of TPPO (29) transfers an 
electron to styrene 27 which then leads to intermediates of the 
direct pathway. The mediator TPPO (29) formed is in situ by 
anodic oxidation of TPP (30), a molecule which unlikely acts as a 
reductive mediator. The authors declare TPP (30) as the mediator 
and only clarify its role in the mechanistic part which concludes 
their manuscript11  we find this misleading especially to readers 
unfamiliar with mediated electrolysis.
