Description:
A drug for the treatment of HIV, known to have polymorphs with varying solubility and bioavailability.

In another case, an unknown polymorph of Ritonavir, a
drug for the treatment of HIV, was accidentally produced, which
was considerably less soluble and thus bioavailable16. As well as
imposing substantial costs for the drug companies, the temporary
removal of these drugs from the market also interrupt the pa

such risks, by guiding experiments for the preparation of undis

such undiscovered polymorphs exist.
