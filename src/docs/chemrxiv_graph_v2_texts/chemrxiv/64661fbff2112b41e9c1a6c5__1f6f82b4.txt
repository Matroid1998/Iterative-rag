Synthesized through palladium-catalyzed coupling of amides and cyclopropanols.

A strategic solution 
framework of molecular crosscoupling chemistry, with neutral molecules serving as 
the coupling partners, can be envisioned with the following guiding tenets ligand 
exchange should occur (thermodynamically downhill) between heteroatomcentered 
species, with the displacing ligand subsequently capable of rearranging from the 
heteroatomligated to carbonligated mode (Scheme 1b). We speculate that a 
combination of acidbase and carbon elimination reactions would allow the 
implementation of these key steps. Our synthetic endeavor has validated this conjecture 
and herein, we wish to report a palladiumcatalyzed coupling of amides and 
cyclopropanols for the synthesis of diketones. The reaction can be rationalized by the
