Approximately 50 of known enzyme reactions require cofactors, the most popular being 
30 
nicotinamide cofactors, which can be prohibitively expensive and unstable outside of cells.79 
31 
Pathways can be designed to recycle these redox cofactors, and sacrificial substrates can be 
32 
included where this is not possible, allowing for their inclusion in catalytic rather than 
33 
stoichiometric quantities, but this is not always enough to offset costs and make enzymatic 
34 
syntheses economical.1013 As a result, the development and implementation of synthetic 
35 
nicotinamide cofactor biomimetics (NCBs) is an active area of research that aims to facilitate CFB 
36 
in industrial settings and at scale.10,14
