Description:
Form part of the tetrahedral structure in silicates.

Many useful properties of materials manifest from the precise structure of a given compo
sition. Traditional structure determination techniques such as Xray diffraction (XRD) is
suitable for atoms of moderatetohigh atomic number; however, it can lead to ambiguous
structure assignments for materials containing atoms with low atomic number.1 In addition,
XRD relies heavily on longrange order for correct measurement, but such longrange order
is often lacking in many classes of materials, e.g. nanostructures, amorphous materials and
materials with a tetrahedral network, making structural characterization of such materials
via XRD difficult. Such as a class of materials are exemplified by silicates which consist
of a tetrahedral structure of silicons and oxygens (which have low atomic number and are
difficult to observe via XRD).
