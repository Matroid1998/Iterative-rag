Description:
Structurally well-defined bimetallic surface studied for its electronic properties and adsorption behavior.

Text:
More direct studies of 
these effects, correlating structural and electronic modifications with catalytic properties, became 
feasible with the advent of modern highresolution spectroscopies and microscopies and in particular 
of theoretical methods, in combination with the increasing knowledge in the reproducible preparation 
of structurally welldefined model surfaces  systems.17,18 
As part of an extensive series of combined experimental and theoretical studies on the structure, 
stability, electronic properties and adsorption behavior of structurally welldefined bimetallic 
PdAgPd(111) 1823 and PtAgPt(111) 2428 surfaces, we here report results of a theoretical study on the 
stability of different AgPt(111) and PtAgPt(111) surfaces, as indicated by the formation enthalpy and 
surface energies, on their electronic properties, and on the CO adsorption behavior.
