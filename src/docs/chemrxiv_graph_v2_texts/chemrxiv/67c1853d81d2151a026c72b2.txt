Description:
A greenhouse gas whose levels have increased due to fossil fuel combustion, impacting ecosystems.

Text:
The sustained combustion of fossil fuels required to fulfill the energy requests of our societies has 
led to a drastic increase in the anthropogenic CO2 levels, causing devastating effects on the 
environment and life of many ecosystems. Although a transition to green energies would be 
desirable, it is still not feasible to cover all energy demands exclusively with green energies 1. CO2 valorization emerges as an appealing strategy to counteract the current situation and represents 
a carbon neutral route for the generation of valueadded energy carriers, while simultaneously 
reducing the anthropogenic CO2 levels 2. Currently, different strategies are used for CO2 
conversion, which include thermo 310, photo 1114 and electrocatalysis 1523, among 
others.

Description:
Involved in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction under mild conditions.

Text:
Interestingly, CO2 conversion via the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a 
very interesting process as it is carried out under mild operating conditions, usually at room 
temperature and moderate pressures. In addition, renewable energy resources can provide the 
required electricity for electrolysis, making the electrochemical pathway also environmentally 
attractive. The electrochemical CO2RR is mainly limited by its selectivity challenge. On the one hand, 
the formation of H2(g) from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (i.e., equation 1) is observed for 
cathodic polarization, which is a competing side reaction under CO2RR conditions 24. On the 
other hand, there is the possibility of forming multiple C1 products (i.e., equations 2  5) or 
multicarbon products (i.e., C2) 25.
