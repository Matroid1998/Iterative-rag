that Cu NCs have garnered significant attention as catalysts 
for electrochemical CO2RR due to their high reactivity and 
unique structural architecture, which can selectively tune 
product formation. In this work, we aim to explore the 
potential of a uniquely designed Cu23 NC as a catalyst for 
CO2RR. To perform the electrochemical measurements, a 
thin film electrode was fabricated using a spray coating 
technique. This involved depositing a slurry of the Cu23 NCs 
and carbon black (CB) onto a carbon paper substrate. It is 
crucial to maintain the geometric and electronic structure 
of the NCs during this loading process to preserve their 
electrocatalytic properties. The stability of the Cu23 NCs 
during this process was assessed using Xray absorption 
fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.
