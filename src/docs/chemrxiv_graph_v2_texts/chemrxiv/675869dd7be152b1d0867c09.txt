Description:
A gas that can be removed from the atmosphere using specific removal technologies.

This leaves a large amount

of methane that cannot be mitigated unless new currently unknown mitigation technolo

gies are discovered, or if a technology is developed to remove methane from the atmo

sphere, similar to carbon dioxide removal technologies. 63
While the Global Methane Pledge signed by many countries may contribute to re
64
ducing emissions (European Commission, 2023 November 2021, Brussels), it is not suf
65
ficient to prevent 1.5 C of global warming by 2050 (Rogelj  Lamboll, 2024). In addi
66
tion, due to global temperature rise the biological emissions of methane are increasing
67
substantially (Kleinen et al., 2021; Nisbet et al., 2023), which can not be addressed through
