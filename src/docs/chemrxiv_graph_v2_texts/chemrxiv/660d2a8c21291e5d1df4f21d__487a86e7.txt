Description:
Compounds whose reactivity can be improved with P-based ligands.

1A).1b In the 50 years since its discovery, many iterations of ligands 
 mainly Pbased  have appeared, which improved the reactivity for 
more challenging amines and aryl halides.1b In recent years, 
alternatives to canonical Pd catalysis have appeared in the literature, 
identifying Cu and Ni as one of the most promising alternatives.3 Yet, 
the mechanistic framework of M0MII catalytic cycles based on complex 
phosphine or NHC ligands still dominated (Fig. 1A).4 In 2016, 
Buchwald and MacMillan provided a new platform that permitted facile 
CN bond formation merging photoredox and nickel catalysis (Fig. 1B),5 avoiding the design and multistep synthesis of supporting 
ligands.

Description:
React with electron-deficient aryl bromides to form CN bonds in Ni-catalyzed processes.

1B).8 Many subsequent variants followed, and examples refining 
and improving the conditions with,9 or without the use of donating 
ligands are still at the forefront of the catalysis landscape.10, 11 Building 
up on this new mechanistic paradigm, in 2020, Nocera and coworkers 
reported a Nicatalyzed protocol that allowed the formation of CN 
bonds between electrondeficient aryl bromides and amines through a 
proposed NiINiIII redox process, without the need of light or a 
photocatalyst (Fig. 1C). Similar to the photoredox processes, no 
additional ligands on the Ni catalyst were required.12 However, the 
proofofconcept study reported by Nocera and coworkers was 
applied to simple bromoarenes.
