Description:
A fluorinated functional group with limited methods for introduction to aliphatic frameworks.

Text:
The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) group is situated on an exclusive list of fluorinated functional groups with documented utility 
that remain shrouded in obscurity.1 The reason for this dissonance is attributed to limited pentafluorosulfanylation methods 
and reagents, particularly with respect to introducing the SF5 group to aliphatic frameworks.2 For instance, SF5Cl gas  one 
of the few reliable sources of SF5 radicals with applications in C(sp3)SF5 synthesis3  has been historically difficult to 
synthesize and handle,4 thus preventing widespread adoption of the chemistry and impeding further innovation.
