Description:
Unsaturated compounds involved in cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
In addi
tion to the utilization of oxidative Heck couplings,2934 more re
cent examples have showcased that crosscouplings of tetrasub
stituted alkenyl electrophiles comprise an attractive alternative 
to tradition alkene coupling reactions. However, a vast majority 
of these transformations are structurally limited to ,unsatu
rated compounds, such as acrylates and ketones.3442 
In contrast, highly stereoselective methods for the assembly of 
unactivated acyclic tetrasubstituted alkenes have remained 
scarce.
