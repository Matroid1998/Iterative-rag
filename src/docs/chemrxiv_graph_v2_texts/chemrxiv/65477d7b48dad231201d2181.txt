Description:
Compounds that can undergo asymmetric hydrogenation to form chiral molecules.

Text:
Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is 
among the most widely used transformations to prepare chiral mol
ecules from prochiral substrates,1 with classic methods for transition 
metalcatalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation based on the oxidative 
addition of H2 (Scheme 1a).2 While these reactions are high per
forming and widely used, they historically require substrates with co
ordinating functional groups for chelating, twopoint metal binding 
to facilitate enantioinduction3 with limited exceptions.4 Further, the 
highest enantioselectivity is observed with electronpoor olefins 
(activated olefins), as interactions between the substrate and the 
metal are best promoted by substituents on the olefin that are typi
cally electronwithdrawing.5 Recently, hydrogenation of electron
neutral, electronrich (unactivated), and minimally functionalized 
olefins has seen growing improvement and success; however, lower 
enantioselectivity is commonly observed, and fewer methods are 
available.6 
In this context, radical hydrofunctionalization enabled by metal
catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (mHAT, Scheme 1b) reactions 
have particular promise as they do not require metal coordination of 
the olefin for reactivity.7 Mechanistically, mHAT involves a metal
hydride intermediate that transfers H to the olefin to generate an 
alkyl radical that may be trapped under mild conditions.

Description:
Unactivated olefins react well in mHAT methods due to their high reactivity and low bond dissociation energy.

Text:
First, unactivated olefins react well in mHAT methods, enabled 
by the high reactivity (low bond dissociation energy) of the weak 
metalhydride bond.8b The hydride source and reductant in mHAT 
is a silane or borohydride,8a, 8b, 10 enabling selective monoreduction of 
a polyalkene via stoichiometry control, which would be more chal
lenging using a traditional hydrogenation in which the reductant is 1 
atm of H2 or solvent alcohol. Finally, the radical mechanism offers 
complementary selectivity relative to a typical transitionmetal cata
lyzed mechanism, with improved chemoselectivity and preservation 
of sensitive functional groups.8a, 8b, 10 
One problem with these singlecatalyst mHAT systems (Scheme 
1b) is that they require at least stoichiometric loading of an oxidant, 
such as tertbutyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), which is necessary to turn 
over the M2M3 cycle.
