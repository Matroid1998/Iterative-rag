Description:
A core structure found in natural products and lead molecules.

Chiral molecules with their defined 3D structures are of paramount importance for the study of chemical biology and drug 
discovery. Natures ability of rapid assembly of molecules with structural diverse at various levels of complexity has inspired 
numerous development of efficient synthetic methodologies.1,2 In practice, chiral architectures are usually prepared from 
organometallic and organocatalytic processes where transition metals or enzymes or organocatalysts are operated for a desired 
reaction. Whereas enzymatic catalysis sets a high standard for the stereoselectivity, organometallic and organocatalysis have an 
advantage for a more diverse scope of reactions.3,4
