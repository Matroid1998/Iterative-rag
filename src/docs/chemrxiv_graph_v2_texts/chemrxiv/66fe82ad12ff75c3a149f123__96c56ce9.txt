Description:
A harmful gas to which room temperature selective gas sensors are extremely sensitive.

Numerous works have shown, that their
optimal electronic structure can benefit many crucial devices 815
and to achieve this, it can be precisely tuned by manipulation of thick
ness and composition, as well as by strain or defect engineering 16
23. Fieldeffect transistors (FETs) are a prime example 24, followed
by room temperature (RT) selective gas sensors, extremely sensitive to
NO2 among other harmful gases 2530, THz modulators 31, pho
todetectors 32, or lithiumion batteries 33. Characteristic physic
ochemistry of TMDs surface processes arises since Mo is covalently
bonded to the six nearest neighboring chalcogens through hybridiza
tion of its sd5 orbitals. That leaves no coordinatively unsaturated sur
face sites leading to the chemically inactive basal plane.
