Description:
A metal with high availability and low cost, used in lanthanide ferrite materials.

In particular, there has been a special interest in the influence of manganese, 
cobalt and iron as Mcations.14 Cobaltbased materials seem to exhibit the most 
promising activities5,6 but cobalt is considered a critical raw element by the EU.7 Although 
iron catalysts seem to exhibit poor activity in comparison to other metals, the high 
availability and low cost of iron precursors have kept lanthanide ferrite materials in the 
scientific spotlight. Given the influence of surface area in all heterogeneous processes, synthesis plays a 
significant role in catalytic performance. LaFeO3 catalytic properties have been improved 
when synthesized as nanoparticles. The most common synthesis routes to obtain a small 
particle size of perovskite materials are sol gel and coprecipitation.
