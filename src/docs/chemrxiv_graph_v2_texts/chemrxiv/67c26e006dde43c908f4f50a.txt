Description:
A compound involved in scattering experiments from highly concentrated salty water microjets.

These experiments were enabled by the

development of the wetted wheel by Fenn and Siegbahn as a method to introduce continuallyrefreshed

microjets4244 further advanced the field, unlocking the ability to investigate interfacial interactions on 
44 
more volatile liquids45 and thus the vaporwater interface.46 Relevant experiments include scattering of

HCl, DCl, and N2O5 from highly concentrated salty water microjets.4749 More complex studies have also
