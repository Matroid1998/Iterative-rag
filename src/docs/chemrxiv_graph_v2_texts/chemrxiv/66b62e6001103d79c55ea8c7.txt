Description:
Light nuclei where nuclear quantum effects are significant even at room temperature.

Nuclear quantum eects (NQEs) play an impor
tant role in quantum chemistry, becoming par
ticularly signicant in scenarios such as coni
cal intersections, molecular vibrations, and low
temperature atomic coherence and exchange ef
fects.1 This is especially true for light nuclei
like hydrogen, where even at room tempera
ture NQEs cannot be overlooked. Traditional
quantum chemical calculations often rely on the
BornOppenheimer (BO) approximation to sep
arate electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. While this allows for classical propagation of
nuclei on the electronic potential energy surface
or the use of approximations to extract dynamic
nuclear information, it fails to capture the sub
stantial coupling between nuclear and electronic
wave functions that directly inuence chemical
phenomena. To address these challenges, various method
ologies have been developed.
