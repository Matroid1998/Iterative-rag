Description:
Single crystals offer excellent charge transport properties, low defect densities, and high carrier mobility.

Depending on composition and conditions, perovskites can crystallize in 
cubic, orthorhombic, or tetragonal systems.4 Among other MHPs, cesium lead bromide 
(CsPbBr) perovskite has drawn considerable interest due to its superior thermal and structural 
stability compared to its organic and inorganic counterparts.5,6 CsPbBr (CPB) can exist as bulk 
crystals or nanocrystals (NCs), each exhibiting distinct properties suited for different 
applications.7 Single crystals of CPB offer excellent charge transport properties, low defect 
densities, and high carrier mobility, making them ideal for optoelectronic devices such as
