Description:
Known for its donor properties in a variety of ligand structures.

Text:
On other hand, the known donor properties of nitrogen in a variety of ligand structures, 
little has been reported concerning the potential ligand properties of oxime ethers12. Oxime 
ethers are stable and are relatively simple to synthesize and thus it was of interest to us to explore 
their ligand properties. PRESENT WORK 
In a continuation of our research in the design of multidentate heteroaromatic ligands1318, 
benzyloxyiminoacetic acid19, 1,3Dithialanemethanol20 and sulfur ethers21 are successfully 
formed topological structure with soft transition metals ion. Encouraged by these results, we 
synthesize and characterize of new aromatic derivatives containing the 1,3dithiolane and 
benzyloximate moiety.

Description:
Atoms in oximate form that can interact with soft transition metal ions.

Text:
Such compounds contain multiple sulfur atoms and oximate nitrogen 
atoms in differing positions and thus have the potential to form new complex structures or 
networks from interactions with soft transition metal ions.
