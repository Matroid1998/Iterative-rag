Description:
A III-V photoabsorber used in photovoltaic applications and photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Text:
Due to their promising photovoltaic performances, III
V photoabsorbers such as InP gain a lot of attraction
with respect to their application in the field of photo
electrochemical water splitting 1, 2. However, the role
of surface defects, especially in contact with the liquid
electrolyte, is still not fully understood, impeding fur
ther efficiency improvement of the photoelectrode. For
that reason, the focus was redirected to the electrochem
ical interface of the semiconducting photoabsorber and
the liquid electrolyte in the last decade 35. Further
more, the interaction of InP as photoabsorber with water
is also of high relevance when depositing conductive ox
ides as electrochemical buffer layer using atom layer de
position (ALD) where water frequently is used as oxide
precursor 6, 7.
