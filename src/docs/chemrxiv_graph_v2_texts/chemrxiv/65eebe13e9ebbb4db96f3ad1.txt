A promising energy carrier for bridging the gap between supply and demand of renewable energies.

Green hydrogen is a promising energy carrier to bridge the gap between supply and demand of renewable energies. Amongst the 
technologies to produce hydrogen by water splitting, proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the most promising 
approaches. The major advantages of this technology are a high power density resulting in a compact stack architecture, and its capability to 
follow fast load fluctuations.1 These two advantages are especially important considering a future scaleup of the technology to Gigawatt
scales and the connection to renewable, inherently intermittent energy sources.
