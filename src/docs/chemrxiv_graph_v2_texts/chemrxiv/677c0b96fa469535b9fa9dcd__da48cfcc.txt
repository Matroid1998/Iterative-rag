Description:
A biogenic mineral formed by marine organisms through biomineralization.

Text:
Numerous marine organisms, such as algae, sponges, and mollusks, produce hard, mineralized tissues
made of calcium carbonate through the process of biomineralization.1 These calcifying organisms play a
crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering significant amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The significance of this carbon dioxide sink becomes evident when considering the extensive coral reefs
and vast fields of blooming algae, visible even from space. With ocean acidification likely impeding this
cycle, there is a threat of a negative feedback loop, where reduced carbon capture leads to increased ocean
acidification, further disrupting CO2 sequestration.2 Understanding biomineralization mechanisms, and
more specifically, the impact of external factors on organisms ability to form biogenic calcite, is critical
for assessing their impact on these complex mineral formation pathways.
