Description:
A high-performing cobalt-based OER catalyst with notable overpotential, Tafel slope, mass activity, and stability.

Text:
Subsequent electrocatalytic evaluations unveiled that 
Co0.5Fe0.5O0.5F1.5 is one of the highest performing cobaltbased OER catalysts reported to date, 
considering metrics of overpotential, Tafel slope, mass activity, and stability. Complementary lines of 
computational and mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate that the existence of a bimolecular 
reaction mechanism that is deemed to be the origin of the high efficiency of Co0.5Fe0.5O0.5F1.5.
