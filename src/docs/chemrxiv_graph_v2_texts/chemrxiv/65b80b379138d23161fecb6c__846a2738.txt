Description:
Refers to the carbon atom in lactols that bears a hydrogen substituent.

Kinetic resolution is a widely developed process 
that has been extensively used for industrial and academic 
applications to allow the effective preparation of enantiomerically 
pure compounds.1 Despite its widespread use, a recognised 
inherent drawback is that the theoretical maximum yield of a 
single product enantiomer from a racemate is 50. This limitation 
can be overcome by a using a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) 
approach, that necessitates the individual enantiomers of the 
racemic starting material to interconvert (enantiomerization) at a 
timescale compatible with a subsequent enantioselective 
derivatization event (such as acylation).1v Current stateofthe art 
DKRs commonly use secondary alcohols or trisubstituted lactols 
(that contain a Hsubstituent at the carbinol carbon), with 
enantiomerization 
promoted 
through 
reversible 
dehydrogenationhydrogenation (Fig 1AB) or intramolecular ring 
closurering opening (Fig 1CD).

Description:
Requires C(3)perfluorinated substituents for reactivity in the described methodology.

Text:
To the best of our knowledge only a single report from 
Ye and coworkers utilising NHC catalysed enantioselective 
acylative DKR of benzosultam derived trifluoromethyl substituted 
hemiaminols has been reported in this area to date.4 Although 
excellent enantioselectivity was observed, this methodology was 
limited by the need for C(3)perfluorinated substituents at the 
carbinol centre, and requires a stoichiometric oxidant (3,3,5,5
tetratertbutyldiphenoquinone, DQ) for reactivity (Fig 1D).
