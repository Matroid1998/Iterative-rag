Description:
Used as a solvent with DBU at 80 C.

of additional complexity, 
and combined with the aforementioned functionalisation and 
the excellent selectivity obtained in the enol triflate formation, 
this underlines the versatility of such systems to function as tri
cyclic 3D scaffolds. Scheme 4. Direct conversion to 8,5,5fused system 23 

a) TFA, CH2Cl2, 0 C to rt then oxalyl chloride, CH2Cl2, 0 C to 
rt; b) DBU, MeCN, 80 C; c) AllylMgBr, THF, 0 C to rt; d) PdC 
(10), HCO2NH4, MeOH, 60 C; e) NaHMDS, THF, 78 C, then 
PhNTf2, to rt; f) ArB(OH)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3, LiCl, 1,4dioxane, 
85 C; g) PdC (10), HCO2NH4, MeOH, 60 C. 
Following this, the previously observed cyclisation to form me
sylate 17 led us to consider whether such a bond formation 
might permit an overall rearrangement within these polycyclic 
scaffolds.
