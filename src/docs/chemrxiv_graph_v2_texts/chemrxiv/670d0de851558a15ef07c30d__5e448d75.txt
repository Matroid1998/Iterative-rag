Description:
Produced predominantly through the cumene process involving benzene and propene.

Text:
Some aldehydes and ketones belong to the most important chemicals produced and used in 
chemical industry as well as in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry with formaldehyde, 
acetone and butanone being the most prominent examples. Industrially, different synthesis 
routes are applied. In the direct oxidation of alkenes, which is namely the HchstWacker 
process, palladium(II) chloride and copper(II) chloride are used as catalysts 1. The oxidative 
dehydrogenation of alcohols as used in the Formox process for the production of formaldehyde 
patented by JohnsonMatthey relies on either iron molybdate or silver metal 2. The route 
predominantly used for the production of acetone today is the cumene process, where benzene 
and propene form cumene, which is treated with oxygen to yield phenol and acetone 1.

Description:
Used similarly to butanone.

Text:
Lastly, 
butanone, which is of similar use as acetone, is produced through nonoxidative 
dehydrogenation of 2butanol using zinc oxide or copper(II) oxide as catalysts 3. In the research of selective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols, the catalyst materials 
studied most in the past cover primarily typical support materials such as TiO2, CeO2, Al2O3 
and Fe2O3 carrying gold, palladium or platinum nanoparticles 47. More recently, oxide 
catalysts have been increasingly focused on, because of lower financial cost and their 
superiority to noble metal based materials in terms of sintering rates, thermal stability and
