Description:
A rocksalt material of interest for increasing valley degeneracy through nontrivial electronic structure topologies.

Text:
Engineering high valley degeneracy is a common design strat
egy for achieving high thermoelectric performance, as it en
ables high electrical conductivity while simultaneously maintain
ing high thermopower.16 In the absence of intervalley scattering,
the thermoelectric quality factor, which determines the maximum
thermoelectric gure of merit zT, is directly proportional to the
valley degeneracy NV .7 Improving zT by increasing the valley de
generacy has been a focus of many studies; for example, converg
ing the valence bands of PbTe at the Lpoint (NV  4) and along
the line (NV  12) has been shown to improve the thermoelec
tric performance of ptype PbTe.813
Recently, nontrivial electronic structure topologies have also at
tracted interest as a strategy for increasing the valley degeneracy
in materials such as rocksalt SnSe,14,15 PbTeSnTeGeTe alloys,16
and Bi2Te3.1719 In these systems, it is often discussed that band
inversion leads to highlycorrugated Fermi surfaces with multiple
carrier pockets near the band edge.

Description:
Has inverted bands at the Lpoint of the Brillouin zone in the rocksalt phase.

Text:
The partial contributions of atomic orbitals
to each band suggest that SnTe, SnSe, SnS, GeSe, and GeS in the
rocksalt phase have inverted bands at the Lpoint of the Brillouin
zone, while PbTe, PbSe, PbS, and GeTe do not, in agreement with
previous studies.26,27
All compounds with normal band ordering exhibit a single car
rier pocket at the Lpoint for both the conduction and valence
bands, whereas the shapes of the band edges are more diverse
for compounds with inverted bands. For example, while SnTe ex
hibits a single carrier pocket for the conduction and valence bands
centered at each Lpoint (Figure 1a), each halfpocket breaks into
three full carrier pockets that are offset from the Lplane (i.e.

Lpoint) in rocksalt SnSe and SnS (Figures 1b, S1f), resulting
in an overall 6 increase in the valley degeneracy from NV  4
to NV  24. Additionally, rocksalt GeSe and GeS both exhibit a
toroidal conduction band Fermi surface (Figures 1c and S1e) as
opposed to a single conduction band pocket. It is interesting that similar compounds with inverted bands ex
hibit diverse Fermi surface geometries, some with a single pocket
centered at each Lpoint and others with multiple carrier pockets
