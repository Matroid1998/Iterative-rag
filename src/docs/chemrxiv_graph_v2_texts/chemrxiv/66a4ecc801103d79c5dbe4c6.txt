Description:
Compounds that can be functionalized through latestage CH functionalization.

Text:
Recently, peripheral functionalization 
through latestage CH functionalization has become a mod
ern and popular method, offering versatile and efficient ways 
to embellish these amines.27 In contrast to such peripheral 
functionalization, skeletal remodeling, which involves de
construction and reediting the core ring structure, has recently 
garnered significant attention as a new approach in organic 
synthesis.813 Skeletal remodeling can be divided into two 
phases the cleavage of inert bonds and further transformations. This allows for the conversion of pyrrolidine frameworks into 
differentsized cyclic amines through insertion or contraction 
reactions, or into carbocycles through replacement reactions.

Structurally edited compounds accessible through ring system modification.

Therefore, this method of modifying ring systems can have a 
substantial impact by enabling access to diverse structurally 
edited amines and unexplored chemical spaces.14 
However, the establishment of versatile skeletal remodeling 
of pyrrolidines still faces significant challenges, particularly in 
the first phase involving CN bond cleavage.15 For example, 
ringopening reactions via homolytic cleavage using radicals 
are well known for smaller rings such as aziridines and azet
idines, driven by ring strain.1624,25,26 These methods, however, 
are not applicable to pyrrolidines, making the process more 
challenging (Figure 1B).27 Although still limited to date, in
genious examples to tailor the unstrained pyrrolidine systems 
have been developed, which can be categorized into three 
mechanistically distinct approaches.
