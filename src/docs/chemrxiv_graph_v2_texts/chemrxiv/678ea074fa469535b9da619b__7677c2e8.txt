Description:
A synthetic substance similar to THC, approved by the FDA for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis.

Text:
Currently,
only dronabinol (synthetic THC) and nabilone (a synthetic substance similar to THC) are
approved by the FDA, and are used to treat chemotherapyinduced nausea and emesis. We thus aimed to enrich the landscape of existing CB2R ligands, which involved setting up
our ligand screens in order to maximise the number of identifiable ligands. Since the CB2R
ligand binding pocket is fairly hydrophobic, we experimented with the addition of water
molecules to it. In addition, we used different active and inactive receptor conformations,
with the objective of analysing the efficacies of the emerging ligands. Predicted hits were
