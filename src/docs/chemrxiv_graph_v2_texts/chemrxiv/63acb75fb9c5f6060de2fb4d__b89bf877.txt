Description:
A molecular perovskite with a crystal structure incorporating molecular units.

Text:
ABX3 molecular perovskites, where A andor X are molecular moieties, have attracted increased 
attention in recent years.1 Research on molecular perovskites such as (NH2)2CHMn(HCOO)3,2 
N(CH3)4Cd(N3)3,3 and (NH2)3CMn(H2POO)3,4 has drawn inspiration from decades of research 
in the oxide perovskites, but with the additional benefit of the chemical space as offered by the 
inclusion of molecular units in the crystal structure,5 as illustrated in Figure 1.
