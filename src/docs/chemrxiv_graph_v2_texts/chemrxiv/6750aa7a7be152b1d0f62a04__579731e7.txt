Description:
A component of enzymes that acts as a catalyst for a range of chemical oxidations.

Text:
Hemecontaining enzymes are powerful and versatile catalysts. They are capable of a vast range of chemical oxidations, requir
ing only O2 or H2O2 and a source of electrons and protons. For 
H2O2dependent oxidations  namely in the heme peroxidases 
 the mechanisms of oxidation have been widely studied,1 but 
the processes involved in proton delivery that accompany the 
OO bond cleavage and the subsequent oxidation of substrate 
are still poorly defined.

Description:
Involved in electron movement linked to proton movement in enzymes.

Text:
This matters because the movement of 
electrons in all heme enzymes is invariably linked to the move
ment of protons, and controlling both is key to the design of 
bespoke heme catalysts for specific applications in the future.2 
The availability of neutron structures for some peroxidase en
zymes3 has meant that the protonation states of active site resi
dues can now be directly visualized. These neutron structures 
reveal individual hydrogen bonds, including to active site water 
molecules. But while neutron diffraction can identify single hy
drogen atoms (or, more specifically, deuterium atoms) in a 
static location, it cannot identify their origin, nor can it identify 
dynamic movements of protons during catalysis.
