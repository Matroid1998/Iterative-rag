Description:
A material used in the formation of hydrogels.

Due to its positive charge, 
it can interact with negatively charged drugs and protect them from degradation in the 
body.5 It has been used to deliver a wide range of drugs, including antibiotics, anti
cancer drugs, and proteins. Another promising application of chitosan is in gene therapy. Chitosan can form complexes with DNA and facilitate gene delivery to cells. This has the 
potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders and other diseases.6 
 Compared with other kinds of hydrogels based on other materials including polyvinyl 
acetate, tripolyphosphate, sulfobetaine, chitosan hydrogels have more disadvantages.
