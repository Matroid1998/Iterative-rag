However, despite extensive studies in photocatalytic 
HATinduced C(sp3)H functionalization, the development of CP 
bond formation remains a formidable challenge at the current 
stage (Figure 1A). The hurdles include the oxidationsensitivity of 
commonly used P(III) and HP(V) reagents,5 poor compatibility 
between Preagents and electrophilic HAT reagents,5a,6 low 
reactivity between nucleophilic alkyl radicals and common P
reagents,5a,6a,7 and the requirement of excess CH substrates in 
most intermolecular HAT processes.2a,2b 
Aminophosphonic acids have attracted substantial 
interests in medicinal chemistry due to their intriguing biological 
activities8 (Figure 1B). The potential utility of aminophosphonic 
acids has stimulated significant research efforts aimed at 
developing efficient protocols for their synthesis. Conventionally, 
aminophosphonates were synthesized by the Pudovik 
reaction,9 which involves nucleophilic addition of a dialkyl 
phosphite to an imine under basic conditions.
