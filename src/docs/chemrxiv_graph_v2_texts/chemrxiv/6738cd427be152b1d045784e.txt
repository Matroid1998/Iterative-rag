Description:
Biological energy transduction is most commonly mediated by quinones.

Text:
Such interactions are
critical in maintaining redox homeostasis within the cell.5 Redox potential not only influ
ences the thermodynamics of these critical biological processes, but also plays a crucial role
in bioelectronic applications like bioelectrocatalysis and bioelectronic sensing. In these ap
plications, electroactive bacteria or redox active enzymes catalyze electron transfer to and
from electrodes for purposes including analyte sensing, energy generation, and chemical syn
