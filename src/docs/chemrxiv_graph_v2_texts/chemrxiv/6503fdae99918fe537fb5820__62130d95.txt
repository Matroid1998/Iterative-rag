Description:
A compound involved in the equilibrium with calcium, hydroxide, and phosphate ions.

Taking this into account, a HAP 
nanoparticle is a mixture of the surface phase and the bulk phase, rather than a pure solid. The effect of size 
on the solubility of calcium phosphate crystals has been analyzed.14 As Best noted in 1959 Under such 
circumstances the solubility product will not be defined, a conclusion in agreement with the discrepant 
results of the various attempts to measure such a quantity experimentally.9
