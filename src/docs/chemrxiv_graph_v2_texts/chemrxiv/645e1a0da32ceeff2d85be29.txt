Description:
A costly catalytically active metal used in milling materials.

However, the 
milling materials used are typically manufactured from 
costly catalytically active metals such as Pd.6,7,9 To 
address this issue, we recently proposed a galvanization 
process for milling materials that coats the catalyst as a 
nmthick layer onto the milling ball surface.8 Such coated 
milling balls are substantially cheaper while showing the 
same 
catalytic 
activity 
as 
bulk 
milling 
balls.8 
Nevertheless, abrasion remains a concern since fast
moving balls can exert mechanical stress on the ball 
surface, leading to undesired catalyst leaching into the
