for the design and implementation of novel metabolic pathways, while precise gene 
editing tools like CRISPRCas9 enable targeted modifications of existing pathways with 
minimal unintended effects4. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize 
agriculture, creating crops that are not only more productive but also more nutritious and 
better adapted to changing environmental conditions. Researchers can now finetune 
metabolic fluxes, redirect carbon flow to desired products, and even introduce entirely 
new biosynthetic capabilities into plants5. This level of control over plant metabolism 
was unimaginable just a few decades ago and holds immense promise for addressing 
agricultural challenges. For instance, engineering efforts have successfully increased the 
vitamin content of staple crops, improved drought tolerance in cereals, and enabled plants 
to produce valuable pharmaceutical compounds6.
