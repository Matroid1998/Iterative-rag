Description:
Acts as a quenching agent for triplet excitons in phosphorescence emissions.

Text:
One is to promote the intersystem crossing (ISC) from the lowest 
excited singlet state (S1) to a triplet state (Tn).10 The other one is to suppress the non
radiative deactivation of the triplet excitons under ambient conditions.11 Therefore, 
besides the small probability of ISC ruled by quantum mechanics, the challenge to 
achieving longlived and bright RTP in purely organic materials is to suppress 
nonradiative decay, including thermal motion and oxygen quenching, etc.1213 
For small molecules, their phosphorescence emissions are usually stabilized by 
crystallization, namely, the rigid crystal lattice could prevent vibrational dissipation and 
avoid contacting with oxygenmoisture quenching sites.1416 However, the poor 
reproducibility and processability of crystalline small molecules tremendously limit 
their practical applications. By comparison, polymeric materials possess good 
mechanical 
properties 
and 
ease 
of 
processing.
