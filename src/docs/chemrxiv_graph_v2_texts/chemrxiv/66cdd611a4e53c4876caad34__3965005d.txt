Description:
Centered in chiral spirocycles and remains underdeveloped in stereocenter synthesis.

Text:
Developing substrate generality is a central aim and grand challenge in 
asymmetric catalysis, (1, 2) particularly in constructing quaternary stereogenic centers and 
analogous main group heteroatomstereogenic centers. Methods for their assembly have gained 
great attention due to their intriguing chemical, physical, biological, and stereoelectronic 
properties (Fig 1A). (3) For instance, carbon, boron, and germaniumcentered chiral 
spirocycles are frequently found in chiral ligand design, (4) biologically active compounds, (5) 
and materials (Fig 1B). (610) Typically, accessing different chiral central elements requires 
distinctive synthetic strategies. In contrast to the recent advances to catalytically construct 
sulfur, (11) phosphorus (12) and silicon (13) stereogenic centers, methods to access other 
heteroelement stereocenters, namely boron (14) and germanium (15, 16) remains so far largely 
underdeveloped due to unique synthetic challenges.

Description:
Germanium-carbon bonds in organo germanium compounds feature an enlarged tetrahedral geometry.

Text:
For instance, tetracoordinate boron 
compounds possess a dative bond resulting in distorted tetrahedral geometry (17) and has 
potential lability. The longer as well as more labile germaniumcarbon bonds in organo 
germanium compounds feature an enlarged tetrahedral geometry (Fig 1A). (18) These 
differences render most current strategies for the constructing of C, S, P, and Si stereogenic 
centers inapplicable for their B and Ge congeners. Despite considerable efforts to explore the
