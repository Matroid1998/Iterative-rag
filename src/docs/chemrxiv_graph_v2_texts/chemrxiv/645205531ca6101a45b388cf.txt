Description:
An important base chemical produced from methane.

Text:
Natural gas consists mainly of methane,1 an important resource that can unfortunately have a 
significant impact on our climate if released into the atmosphere.2 Methane can, however, be used 
to produce another important base chemical methanol.

Description:
Currently synthesized from methane through the creation of syngas.

Text:
Methanol is currently synthesized from 
methane through the creation of syngas, a thermodynamically inefficient process, as it requires 
high temperatures and pressures to overcome the reaction energy of 206 kJmol in steam 
reforming.3,4 Due to the need for intermediate syngas creation, the onsite usage of methane at 
smaller and remote sources of methane is greatly hindered, and the methane at such remote sites 
is often simply flared, as its transport to other locations is not easily achieved.4,5 Methanol, 
however, can be stored and transported with much less effort, as it is a liquid under ambient 
conditions.

Description:
A substance derived from methane used in fuels and various chemical applications.

Text:
A direct and selective pathway from methane to methanol, usable at small and large 
scales, would therefore greatly decrease the environmental impact of remote methane sources, 
as well as methanolderived substances and methanolbased fuels. A key challenge is achieving 
high selectivity in the direct methane to methanol reaction. Burning methane is easy, stopping at 
methanol is not.6,7 
Recently, many advances in the field of methane activation have been made. Inspired by 
enzymes, many biomimetic, homogeneous catalysts have been designed811 to achieve the goal 
of high selectivity combined with high yield. However, industrially, heterogeneous catalysts 
provide many advantages.

Description:
A product of methane conversion that should be protected to prevent overoxidation.

Text:
Two 
important design goals for a MOF catalyst for the selective conversion of methane to methanol 
are suggested by economics and prior work 1) the catalyst should be active under mild 
conditions16 and 2) the obtained methanol should be protected to prevent overoxidation.6 Metal
oxo centers are active species for the activation of the CH bond of methane and other alkanes10,17
22 and can be designed into a variety of MOF structures.
