Description:
Employed extensively to finetune the emission wavelength in light emitting devices, maximize absorptive efficiency in tandem solar cells, and optimize responsivity in photodetectors.

In the case of leadhalide perovskites, halide mixing can tune the 
bandgap across several hundreds of nanometers across the visible range.34 Mixedhalide 
perovskites have been employed extensively to finetune the emission wavelength in light emitting 
devices,35,36 to maximize the absorptive efficiency in tandem solar cells,37,38 and to optimize the 
responsivity (R) in photodetectors.9,11,19,21,31
