Description:
An antifolate used in combination treatments for Toxoplasma gondii infection.

Text:
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, infects all warm
blooded animals including humans. If a total of 30 of the worlds human population is estimated to be 
chronically infected with Toxoplasma, severe disease is rare. Nevertheless, Toxoplasma can be critical and 
cause lifethreating disease as for example inducing important neurological deficits in immunosuppressed 
individuals 13, as well as, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and blindness in congenitally infected newborns 
4, 5. In farm animals, toxoplasmosis can lead to abortion, causing important economic burden 6, 7. The 
most frequently used treatments for T. gondii infection are combinations of antifolates, such as pyrimethamine 
and sulfadiazine.
