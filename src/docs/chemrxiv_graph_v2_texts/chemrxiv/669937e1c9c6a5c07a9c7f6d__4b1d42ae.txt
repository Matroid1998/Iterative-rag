of functional groups that lead 
to metalligand interactions in the transition state. A computationally promising complex was 
synthesized, and its enhanced mechanochemical activity in polymer strands was verified 
experimentally. Finally, we find that the enhanced mechanochemistry predicted computationally 
and verified in polymer strands translates to bulk materials, as evidenced by enhanced tearing 
energies in ferrocenecrosslinked nbutylacrylate elastomers. The latter exemplifies the potential 
of a combination of machine learning and molecularly based mechanistic insights to accelerate 
material discovery efforts in polymer networks. We envision this highthroughput screening of mechanically reactive ferrocenes as a 
foundational step for the modulation and tuning of material toughness by the installation of labile 
bonds.
