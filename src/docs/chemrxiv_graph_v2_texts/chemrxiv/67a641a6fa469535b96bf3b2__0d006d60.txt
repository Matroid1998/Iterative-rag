Compounds characterized by CP moieties, used in organic synthesis for constructing CC double bonds.

As part of our overarching strategies to synthesize a diverse range of diarylatedbased bioactive 
compounds (18, Figure 1B), encompassing diarylmethane and diarylketone derivatives, we identified 
organophosphonium salts (i.e., 11) as versatile core scaffolds for these molecules (Figure 1).1, 2 
Organophosphonium salts, characterized by the presence of CP moieties, particularly 
organophosphorusbased Wittig salts, are among the most widely utilized reagents in organic synthesis 
for constructing CC double bonds.1, 2 In recent years, innovative methods for functionalizing the C
P bond have emerged, employing organophosphonium compounds in novel ways to enable the 
formation of new chemical bonds such as CO, CN, CS, and CC bonds.2 These advancements
