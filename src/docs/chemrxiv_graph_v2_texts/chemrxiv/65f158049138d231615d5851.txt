During recent decades, microextraction has been a central theme within analyticalscale sample 
47 
preparation research. Resulting from this, various techniques have been invented and research is 
48 
still very active. One such technique is electromembrane extraction (EME), first presented in 2006 
49 
1, which mainly has been used for bioanalytical and environmental extraction applications 2. 50 
EME is performed using a supported liquid membrane that separates the sample from a clean 
51 
acceptor solution. The liquid membrane comprises a porous polymeric membrane, often 
52 
polypropylene, and a few microliters of organic solvent immobilized in the pores of the membrane 
53 
by strong capillary forces.
