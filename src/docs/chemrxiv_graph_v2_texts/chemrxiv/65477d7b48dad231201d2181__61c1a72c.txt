Description:
Used as a catalyst in olefin hydrofunctionalizations.

Text:
mHAT 
chemistry has been used for olefin hydrofunctionalizations8 with in
expensive Fe, Co, and Mn catalysts and exhibits excellent functional 
group tolerance, permitting latestage functionalizations in total syn
thesis.9 
In 2014, the Shenvi and Herzon groups independently published 
olefin hydrogenation by manganese and cobaltcatalyzed mHAT 
respectively, trapping the transient alkyl radical with a second HAT 
step.8b, e, f mHAT has some advantages over typical transition metal
catalyzed hydrogenations of olefins, which proceed by additions of 
H2.
