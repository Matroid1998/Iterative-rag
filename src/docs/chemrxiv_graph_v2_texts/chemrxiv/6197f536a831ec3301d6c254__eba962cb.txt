Description:
Complexes formed in situ with instability issues in Ni(0) precatalysts and NHC ligands.

Text:
At the same time, in situ formation of Ni(0)NHC complexes has disadvantages of instability of 

Ni(0) precatalysts and NHC ligands,3 inhibitory effects of cyclooctadiene in some classes of catalytic 
processes, especially CH activation processes involving LLHT activation mechanisms,4 and the precise 
control of metalligand stoichiometry, especially on the small scales required for high throughput 
experimentation.5
