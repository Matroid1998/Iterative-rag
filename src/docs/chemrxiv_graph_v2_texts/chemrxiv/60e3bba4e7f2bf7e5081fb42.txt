Description:
A heavy metal ion that greatly reduces fluorescence intensity upon complexation.

Fluorescence material based sensing of metal ions offers numerous benefits over more traditional 
systems, such as detection sensitivity,1 fast response times2 and ease of measurement.3 The 
fluorescence sensing of metal ions typically relies on heavy atom effects in which complexation 
of heavy metal ions such as Hg(II), Pb(II) greatly reduces fluorescence intensity as compared to 
the free ligand or complexes of relatively light metal ions such as Ca(II) or Zn(II).4,5 Due to high 
sensitivity and versatility, fluorescent organic dyes have been researched as fluorescent 
chemosensors for sensing of heavy metals.69 However, chemosensory systems for heavy metal 
ion detection consist of combined fluorophores and macrocyclic molecules10,11 such as azacrown 
ethers or sulfur containing receptors.7,12 Thus, the complexity of the synthesis andor resulting low 
water solubility can be limiting factors.
