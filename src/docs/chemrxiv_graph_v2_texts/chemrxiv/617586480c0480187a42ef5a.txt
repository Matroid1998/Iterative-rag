Description:
Involved in filament growth in solid electrolytes, influenced by mass transport limitations and electrodissolution.

In addition Several mechanisms are proposed for pathways for Li lament growth
in solid electrolytes. These mechanisms can be distinguished by the nature of the anode  SE
interface which can be (i) thermodynamically stable, (ii) unstable, and (iii) metastable based
on the chemical makeup of the SE4. A key underlying mechanism for all these types of inter
faces pertains to the limitations in mass transport of Li metal. Highrate electrodissolution
of the anode can lead to formation of pores at the anode  SE interface21,14. On a subse
quent electrodeposition step, the pores act as magniers of electric eld leading to localized,
nonplanar deposition resulting in laments22,5.

Description:
Local deposition of Li metal due to trace electrical conductivities of material is identified as a potential failure mechanism for solid electrolytes.

In addition to this, interphase formation
in unstable anode  SE interphases leads to large area specic resistances that cause strong
electric and stress elds leading to the fracture of the solid electrolyte23,24. For metastable
interfaces, microstructuredriven, Grithlike cracking processes are also identied over and
above the mass transport limitation mechanism22. Additionally, local deposition of Li metal
due to trace electrical conductivities of material is also identied as a potential failure mech
anism for the solid electrolytes12,13. Understanding the role and impact of heterogenities
in the interface, interphase, and SE on lament formation and growth is vital. While a lot
of work has been done on assessing these interplay for amorphous solid electrolytes (like
Li3PS6)25,4,26,27,28,29, relatively much less work is carried out for polycrystalline solid elec
trolytes.
