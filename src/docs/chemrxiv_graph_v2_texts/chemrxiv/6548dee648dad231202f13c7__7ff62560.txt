Description:
Forms mononuclear systems with rare earth dianionic complexes.

This ensures kinetic stability of the corresponding 
dianionic rareearth complexes, in accordance with the 
previously postulated criteria for the design of stable rare
earth organometallic compounds.11 The current research on 
rareearth dianionic complexes and particular on the Ln3
L2 interaction is predominantly focused on studies of 
complexes Ln3X22L2 and similar ones (where X is an 
auxiliary monoanionic ligand). This includes rareearth 
complexes 
containing 
dianions 
of 
anthracene 
and 
naphtahalene.9, 10, 1219 Such complexes can be regarded as 
ion triplets, where the dianon L2 formally serves as two 
separate monoanions and displays bridging coordination 
modes. However, less studied mononuclear systems of the 
XLn3L2 or M(solv)nX2Ln3L2 types (where M is Na or 
K) 13, 2026 should be of much greater interest.
