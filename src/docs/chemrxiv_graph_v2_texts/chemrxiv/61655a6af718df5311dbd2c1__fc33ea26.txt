Description:
An electron-rich donor used in aromatic donor-acceptor interactions in synthetic supramolecular chemistry.

Sequence is the defining factor in the folding and selfassembly of 
biomolecules to create the functional superstructures which 
underpin biochemistry. On this basis, the integration of sequence 
into supramolecular and polymer chemistry has the potential to 
open up new possibilities for recapitulation of pseudobiological 
function in synthetic chemistry.1 
Aromatic 
donoracceptor 
(DA) 
interactions,2 
involving 
electronrich donors, such as dialkoxynaphthalene (DAN) and 
electronpoor acceptors, such as naphthalene diimide (NDI) 
have been used widely in synthetic supramolecular chemistry,3
7 but are rare in biology which prefers hydrophobic collapse and 
hydrogen bonding. Aromatic DA interactions have been used to 
create chains which are capable of directed folding and self
assembly.
