Description:
A material that can be doped with phosphorus to alter its electronic properties.

Point defects are used to control a variety of electronic and optical
properties of materials, in which the concept of a charge state
of a defect is oftentimes useful. The charge state of a defect is
the relative charge that is localized at the defect site. Analogous
to KrgerVink notation,1 we say that the defect has a negative
charge state when additional electrons are localized at the defect
site (i.e., an acceptor), a positive charge state when electrons are
delocalized from the defect site (i.e., a donor), and a neutral 0
charge state otherwise. In phosphorusdoped silicon for example,
it is typically understood that a P dopant (5 valence e) donates
an electron to the electron reservoir when substituting for Si (4
valence e).
