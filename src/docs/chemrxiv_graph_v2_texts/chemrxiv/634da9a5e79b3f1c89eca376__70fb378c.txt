The inverseelectrondemand DielsAlder reaction (IEDDA), a reaction between an 
electronrich dienophile and an electronpoor diene, has been applied for the ligation of trans
cyclooctenes (TCOs) and tetrazines (Tz).15 This bioorthogonal ligation usually shows high 
reaction rates and makes in vivo bioconjugation possible at low concentrations, as demonstrated 
in numerous studies.1619 As a next step, in 2013 Versteegen et al. reported on the design and 
synthesis of TCO derivatives that upon reaction with a tetrazine eliminate a substituent at the 
allylic position of the TCO.
