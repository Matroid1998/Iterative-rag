By the end of 8th grade, students should know that there are groups of elements 
that have similar properties, including highly reactive metals, less reactive metals, 
highly reactive nonmetals (such as chlorine, fluorine and oxygen) and some almost 
completely unreactive gases (such as helium and neon). (AAAS 1994, p. 78) 

Or more recently 

Those elements classified as metallic range from the highly reactive sodium and 
barium to the noble metals, such as gold and platinum. The nonmetals 
encompass the aggressive, highlyoxidizing fluorine and the unreactive gases 
such as helium. (Overton et al. 2018, preface)
