Description:
A common motif in approved drugs with functionalization methodologies highly sought.

Text:
Heterocyclic scaffolds are present in numerous natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and have found their place in 
material science. 1 , 2 , 3 Among them, the pyridine moiety is, 
according to the US Food and Drug Administration, one of the 
most common motif in approved drugs (Scheme 1A). 4 , 5 As 
biological activity can be finetuned by the substitution pattern at 
this core, methodologies for pyridine functionalizations are highly 
sought. Numerous strategies for the peripheral editing of pyridines 
have been developed but, due to their inherent reactivity 
functionalizations at the C2 and C4 positions of the heterocycle 
prevail,6,7,8,9 with chemical modification at the C3 position still 
presenting a significant challenge.

Description:
A compound that can undergo C3 halogenation or nitration via electrophilic aromatic substitutions.

Text:
Classical C3halogenation or 
C3nitration via electrophilic aromatic substitutions suffer from 
harsh reaction conditions, excessive use of the desired pyridine, 
and low regioselectivity (Scheme 1B).10,11 Over the last decades, 
peripheral editing methodologies have emerged as a powerful 
tool for the introduction of substituents at the C3 position, primarily 
employing nondirected transitionmetal catalysis12,13,14,15,16,17, 
directing groups,7 and most recently a dearomatization
aromatization strategy (Scheme 1B).9 In this approach, electron
deficient azines are transformed into electronrich intermediates 
(enamine, dienamine) that react with electrophilic reagents. Subsequent rearomatization leads to C3substituted pyridine 
derivatives. Along this line, Wang and coworkers reported an 
onepot 
boranecatalysed 
pyridine 
hydroboration 
tandem 
reactions.
