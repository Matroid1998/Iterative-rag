Description:
Formed from the conversion of the 7,8-dihydroxy structural element in sialic acids.

Text:
Mild periodate treatment was used to convert the 7,8dihydroxy structural element in sialic 
acids to aldehyde groups6, which react in a second step in hydrazone or oximeforming reactions.5, 7 
However, published labelling protocols involve a total of 0.52 h incubation of cells at 04C, and wash 
steps to remove excess labelling reagents prior to fluorescence microscopic imaging. This can induce cold 
stress potentially altering cellular surfaces. Herein we describe faster and milder reactions which can be 
performed at ambient or physiological temperature. In order to minimize the number of washing steps, we considered fluorogenic probes, which fluoresce 
more strongly when binding to the cell surface sialic acids than freely in solution.
