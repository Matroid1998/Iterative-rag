Description:
Key structural constituents of membranes with polar head groups and lipophilic tails.

Text:
Membranes function as biological barriers that separate cells from the environment and delineate 
different cellular compartments; they are crucial in maintaining the life sustaining chemical and 
electrical gradients. The key structural constituents of membranes are phospholipids that form the 
membrane surface with their polar head groups and the membrane core with their lipophilic tails 
(Fig 1). In addition to phospholipids, biological membranes contain for example cholesterol, 
proteins, ions, and oligosaccharides. Lipid bilayers play central role in several biological and 
pathological processes such as cell division, intracellular membrane trafficking, and formation of 
lipid rafts (1, 2). To fully understand these processes, atomistic and molecular level understanding 
of lipids is required (3).
