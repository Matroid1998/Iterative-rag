Vegetable oils primarily consist of glycerides, which are esters of glycerol and fatty acids. 23 
Triglycerides are the principal component of any oil and fat. Along with them, they also contain

sterols, fatty alcohols and fatsoluble vitamins are also found in oil and fat. The relative amounts 
26 
of different fatty acids esterified with glycerol vary in different oil types (Chemat, 2017). 27
