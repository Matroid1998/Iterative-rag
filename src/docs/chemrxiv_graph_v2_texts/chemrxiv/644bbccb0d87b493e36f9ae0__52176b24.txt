Description:
Isolable compounds with high inversion energy barriers of 120-185 kJ mol⁻¹.

Text:
The pyramidal inversion 1, a fundamental stereochemical process, is intensively studied 
and wellestablished in tricoordinated heteroatom compounds (X  N, O, P, S), which 
involves a planar transition state and thus sp3sp2sp3 rehybridization at the heteroatoms 
X (Scheme 1a)14. Many isolable phosphines1 and sulfonium salts4 possess high inversion 
energy barriers of 120185 kJ mol1 and 100130 kJ mol1, whereas nitrogen pyramidal 
inversion is rapid and only takes 2025 kJ mol1 in a tertiary amine due to quantum 
tunnelling5. By contrast, the bondangle inversion (BAI) 2 at a singly bonded atom6, is 
much less exploited, though we have extended this isomerization mechanism to the 
bicoordinated heteroatoms in doubly bonded or conjugated systems.
