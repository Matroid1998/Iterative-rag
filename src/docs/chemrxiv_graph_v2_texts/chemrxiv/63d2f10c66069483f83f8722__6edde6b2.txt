Description:
Inactive for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation but can isomerize to catalytically active forms.

Text:
reported that the most stable isomer of Cu4O3 was inactive for alkane oxidative 
dehydrogenation, however, barrierless isomerization to metastable isomers with low barrier 
facilitated its catalytic activity13. Pt13 can populate lowenergy metastable structures under 
hydrogen pressure, which play a major role in its catalytic reactivity14. Pure and alloyed Pt clusters 
supported on Al2O3 were also extensively studied theoretically and experimentally1517, showing 
that at temperatures typical for catalysis, the cluster geometry changes frequently. For the catalysis 
of CO oxidation, Ghosh et al.18 investigated Au clusters deposited on CeO2 (111) with O vacancies. They discovered that, in this case, cluster fluxionality promotes the reaction. In the presence of 
CO, Au2 on ceria dissociates, whereas Au3 survives.
