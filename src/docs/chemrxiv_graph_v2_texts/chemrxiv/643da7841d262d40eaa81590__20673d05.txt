Description:
Disc-like molecules used in the formation of homochiral helices in copolymers.

In the realm of supramolecular polymers, it is 
achieved with lower synthetic efforts by the coassembly of 
complementary monomers interacting through noncovalent 
interactions upon selecting the convenient solvent that triggers 
the aggregation process.1,2 It comes with additional challenges 
associated with lack of control of polymerization reaction and the 
difficulty 
to 
characterize the structure of the 
resulting 
copolymers.35 Better control of the microstructure was achieved 
recently by triggering the assembly of kineticallytrapped 
species,68 but achieving structural control under thermodynamic 
equilibrium is also necessary for many applications.9 In the latter 
case, the degree of association and the length of the copolymers 
will strongly depend on the various equilibrium constants at work 
in the system as well as the mechanism of polymerization.10,11 
Mixing achiral monomers (the soldiers) and chiral monomers 
(the sergeants) is the most widespread strategy to generate 
homochiral helices, and probe the structure and stability of the 
resulting copolymers.1214 Thanks to the socalled sergeants
andsoldiers effect,15 a few percent of sergeant molecules are 
usually enough to get singlehanded helices, notably for 
copolymers derived from disclike molecules such as benzene
1,3,5tricarboxamides (BTAs).16,17 In most of these systems, 
chiral and achiral monomers have roughly similar (co)equilibrium 
constants leading to copolymers with a presumably random 
distribution of the monomers.18 However, recent studies5 
demonstrated that subtle differences in these constants for 
cooperative supramolecular polymer assembly are key to 
manipulate the length and degree of association,1924 as well as 
the composition and monomer sequence2528 in the copolymers, 
with deep consequences on their rheological20 and catalytic 
properties.24 Recording the variation of the copolymer structural 
parameters under various conditions, e. g. temperature and 
concentration, fitted with thermodynamic massbalance models, 
may allow to determine the role of the sergeant a posteriori,23 
but no design of the sergeant can be made a priori.
