Description:
Shows steady-state activity towards selective N2(g) formation during AOR.

6,17 AOR has
several practical usecases such as ammonia as a fuel for
solid oxide fuel cells, where ammonia is oxidized into hy
drogen and dinitrogen, then hydrogen oxidized to water. 18
Another implementation, which we will focus on, is het
erogeneously electrocatalyzed AOR at ambient conditions
using an alkaline aqueous electrolyte. 5,6 While promising
for various applications, industrial implementation of AOR
is limited by the current electrocatalysts facing a range of
drawbacks including sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials,
catalyst poisoning, and high costs. 1,19
An experimental study by De Vooys et al. investigated
AOR on transition metal surfaces, showing steadystate ac
tivity towards selective N2(g) formation on Pt and Ir, while
other metals showed transient N2(g) formation at best.
