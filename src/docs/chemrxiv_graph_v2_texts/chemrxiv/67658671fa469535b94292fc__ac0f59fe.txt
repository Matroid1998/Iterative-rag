Description:
A product formed either by the release of O2 from the active site or directly at the active site through reduction and protonation.

Text:
A putative mechanism for H2O2 production is shown in Fig. 1. After the primary reduction of Cu(II), O2 binds to Cu(I), lead
ing to the formation of a superoxide (O 
2
) species bound to
Cu(II).25 From here, the reaction could proceed in two ways (i)
O 
2
could be released from the activesite and form H2O2 in so
lution, or (ii) LPMOs could form H2O2 directly at their activesite
through successive reduction and protonation (cf. Fig. 1). How
ever, the order of reduction and protonation is unknown. At sev
eral points during this reductionprotonation one could envisage
release of a reactive oxygen species into solution that could lead
to H2O2 formation (shown in light blue in Fig. 1).
