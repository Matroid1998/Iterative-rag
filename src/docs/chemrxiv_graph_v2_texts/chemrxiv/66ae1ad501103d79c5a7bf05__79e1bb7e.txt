Description:
Reactive intermediates that can form from aryl halides.

Text:
Flash flow chemistry is a subset of flow chemistry pioneered by Yoshida and Nagaki.1, 2 The technique is
suited to fast chemical processes in which reactive intermediates are generated. A flash flow synthesis utilises
residence times on the order of seconds, meaning that slower side reactions can often be outcompeted by a
faster dominant and desired process, provided sufficient inreactor mixing has been achieved. The flash flow
approach has been most successfully applied to the generation of aryllithiums from aryl halides, followed by
trapping with an electrophile (Scheme 1) and has facilitated the clean lithiation and trapping of aryl halides
that are liable to aryne formation,3 which bear esters,2 nitriles,4 and even ketones;5 feats which are
difficult if not impossible to achieve using in flask (batch) chemistry.
