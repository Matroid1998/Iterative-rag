Description:
Used to evaluate molecular probe sensitivity through changes in luminescence intensity and lifetime.

Text:
This 
reversible photophysical process involves a collisional deactivation of the chromophore triplet excited state by 
dioxygen in its fundamental triplet state (3).6 This process may lead to the formation of singlet oxygen (1), 
which is detectable through its characteristic luminescence emission or by using a scavenger. The high 
cytotoxicity of these species is instrumental in the development of photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications.7, 
8 In addition, the decrease of luminescence intensity and lifetime provides measurable parameters for dioxygen 
detection. Consequently, the (I0I) and (0) ratios, where I0 and I (respectively, 0 and ) are the luminescence 
intensities (respectively, lifetimes) in the absence and in the presence of O2, can conveniently provide an 
evaluation of molecular probe sensitivity.
