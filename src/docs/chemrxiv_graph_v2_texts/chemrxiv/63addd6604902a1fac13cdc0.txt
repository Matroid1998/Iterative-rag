Serotonergic signaling is essential for a breadth of processes ranging 
from homeostasis to executive function and emotional regulation. In mammals, 
serotonin is thought to play a modulatory role in almost every physiological function.1 
Dysfunction in serotonergic signaling system is associated with anxiety, depression, 
schizophrenia, migraines, autism, Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease.28 Due 
to its importance, the serotonergic system is the target of many pharmaceuticals, such 
as the antidepressant drug families of monoaminoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).9,10 There 
are 7 types of serotonin receptors, and a number of subtypes.
