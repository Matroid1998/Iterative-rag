Description:
A monomer derived from lignin and a major component of lignocellulose biomass.

Text:
Chemically, Lignin is a recalcitrant polymer that is composed of three alcoholic units p
coumaryl alcohol (Hlignin), coniferyl alcohol (Glignin), and synapyl alcohol (Slignin) 
(Scheme 1A).2526 The catabolism of G and S units (here represented by guaiacol and syringol, 
a G and S unit monomers derived from lignin) into biomass products is particularly of 
importance as both are major components of lignocellulose biomass. This catabolic reaction is 
achieved through arylOdemethylation (Scheme 1B) via the action of Cpd I (Fe(IV)O 
porphyrin radical cation) which is also the main oxidant in P450 catalysed reactions. 11 12 The
