process to synthesize gC3N4.2123 Isolated atoms in SACs are clearly evidenced by advanced microscopy 
and further supported by Extended XRay Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (EXAFS).24,25 
However, so far, only average information regarding the environment of metal sites bound to the carbon 
nitride surfaces can be obtained, and the associated surface chemistry of gC3N4 leading to the formation 
of these isolated metal sites, remains illunderstood.26 
As illustrated in Scheme 1, gC3N4 consists primarily of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms, forming 
a polymeric structure based on tristriazine or heptazine repeating units, linked via NH
functionality.6,27,28 In addition to these NH groups, CH and OH surface species may be present as defects 
and potentially serve as reactiveanchoring sites, possibly involved in the postfunctionalization steps.29 
In addition, Lewis basic Nsites and the cavities surrounded by sixN sites, socalled nitrogen pots, 
could also serve as sites for metalation.
