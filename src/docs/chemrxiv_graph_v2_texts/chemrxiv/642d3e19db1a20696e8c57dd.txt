Description:
Form complexes with high stability when interacting with CB6.

Text:
The detailed complexation 
mechanism of CB6 with various guests in aqueous solution concerning thermodynamic 
parameters, kinetic investigations, and molecular mechanics calculations was highlighted by Nau 
and coworkers 14. The results showed that the complex formation of different amines and 
polyamines with CB6 emphasized the formation of complexes with high stability. Due to its 
symmetrical structure with a rigid hydrophobic cavity and two hydrophilic portals, CB6 can form 
polyrotaxane polymers with higher stability compared with cyclodextrins. Based on the affinity of CB6 towards alkyl diammonium ions, stable polyrotaxanes with high 
structural regularities in solid state were synthesized using the principles of selfassembly and
