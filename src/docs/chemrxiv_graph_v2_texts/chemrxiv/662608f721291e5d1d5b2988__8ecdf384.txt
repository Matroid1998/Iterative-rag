Description:
A structurally well-defined bimetallic surface studied for its electronic properties and adsorption behavior.

Text:
This is topic of the present publication, where, as part of an extensive series of combined experimental 
and theoretical studies on the structure, stability, electronic properties and adsorption behavior of 
structurally welldefined bimetallic PdAgPd(111) 611 and PtAgPt(111) 1216 surfaces, we report results 
of a theoretical study of the first principles determination of the surface energy and formation energy 
of different AgPt(111) and PtAgPt(111) surfaces. In addition, for a better understanding of the 
underlying electronic effects, we will compare the resulting trends with those obtained for similar 
AgPd(111) and PdAgPd(111) surfaces.
