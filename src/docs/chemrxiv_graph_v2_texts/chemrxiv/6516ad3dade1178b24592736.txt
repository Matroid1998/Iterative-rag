pressures of reactants and products, i.e. their chemical potentials.3,4 This complexity poses a significant 
challenge for elucidating the distribution and nature of active sites, even when using advanced in situop
erando spectroscopic techniques and stateoftheart computational modelling.5 
For instance, stateoftheart bimetallic NP catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol 
exemplify the complexity of dynamic alloying processes as a function of chemical potential or reaction con
ditions (Fig. 1a).
