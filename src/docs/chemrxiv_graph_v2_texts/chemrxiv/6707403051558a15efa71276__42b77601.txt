Various LMGs using Dgluconic acid, the ringopened structure of Dglucono1,5lactone (1,5GL), 
38 
have already been developed. Song et al. have reported that Dgluconic acid derivatives with a 
39 
benzylidene group at the 2,4position hydroxy groups and an alkylamide group at the 1position can 
40 
be used as organogelators.7, 8 Fang et al. have reported that Dgluconic acid derivatives with a 
41 
benzylidene group at the 2,4position hydroxy groups and a methyl ester group at the 1position can 
42 
be used as organogelators.9 These are derivatives of the linear Dgluconic acid and are immobilized 
43 
with a benzylidene group that can control the molecular mobility of the 2,4position hydroxy groups.
