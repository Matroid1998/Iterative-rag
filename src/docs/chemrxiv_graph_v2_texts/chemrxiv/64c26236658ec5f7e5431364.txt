Description:
The second most common metal found in currently available chiral perovskites.

Text:
In terms of metal ion lead, analogously to MHPs for photovoltaics, lead has been 
used to prepare the vast majority of chiral perovskites, with copper being the second most common 
metal found in currently available chiral perovskites and with just one Sncontaining system reported 
to date.1,2,2025 Considering the toxicity of lead, it is of significant interest to move towards leadfree 
systems, as it is happening for photovoltaic applications, particularly in a relatively young field of 
research as the one of chiral perovskites.
