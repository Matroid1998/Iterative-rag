Description:
A divalent cation that destabilizes fatty acid membranes.

Thus, there is an apparent paradox; fattyacids of short chain length can be 
generated abiotically in some abundance, but only fatty acids of longer chainlength can assemble into membranes 
under prebiotically plausible reactions. Additionally, fatty acid membranes are only stable within a narrow pH range, 
around their pKa value, and are unstable in the presence of divalent cations such as magnesium and calcium, which are 
required for evolution of more advanced biochemical structures like functional ribozymes (16, 17 . For these reasons 
and others, it is unlikely that the first protocellular membranes consisted solely of singlechain fatty acids.
