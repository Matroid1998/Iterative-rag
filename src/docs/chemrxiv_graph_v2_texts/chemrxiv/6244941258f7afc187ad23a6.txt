biochemistry, medicine, and healthcare. Indeed, the development of strategies based on iterative coupling 
of amino acid and nucleotide building blocks heralded the proteomic and genomic revolution.1,2 Substantial 
advancement has also been made towards automated polysaccharide synthesis.3,4 Iteration has been the

cornerstone of all these successful automated synthesis technologies (Fig. 1A), with the building blocks 
being connected together by a single coupling reaction (e.g., amide, phosphonate, or glycosidic bond 
formation).
