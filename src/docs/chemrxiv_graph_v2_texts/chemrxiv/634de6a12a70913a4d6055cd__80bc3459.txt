Description:
The best-in-class catalyst for oxygen reduction, though limited by high cost and low abundance.

In light of the burgeoning availability of low cost solar electricity, a particularly timely 
challenge is the generation of materials that competently catalyze fuelforming small molecule 
transformations which enable the storage of electricity as chemical energy.16 This chemical 
energy subsequently requires a corresponding set of materials to catalyze the conversion of this 
chemical energy back into electricity in a device known as a fuel cell.79 One of these reactions, 
the reduction of oxygen to water, is essential to proton exchange membrane fuel cell 
technologies, but significant research efforts are still required to make these technologies a 
reality.10 Platinum remains the bestinclass catalyst for O2 reduction, but its relatively high cost 
and low abundance are prohibitive to widespread adoption.10 In its place, various firstrow 
transition metal and metalfree alternatives have been considered.1113 
Among these alternative catalyst paradigms, nitrogendoped carbon materials stand out as 
durable, lowcost, highactivity and highefficiency catalysts for oxygen reduction.14,15 These 
structures come in various forms, including nitrogendoped fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and 
graphene.16,17 Regardless of type, though, these materials are intrinsically heterogeneous, 
featuring mixtures of pyridinelike, pyrrolelike and graphiticquaternary nitrogen sites.18 This has 
complicated the study of active sites in these catalysts, rendering the rational iteration and 
improvement of these materials more difficult.
