Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most widely used surface analysis techniques, 
and has become particularly important in analysis of metal halide perovskites.1 This class of 
materials has been of intense interest for over a decade because of potential applications as 
photovoltaic absorbers, rivalling well established technologies owing to their remarkable 
optoelectronic properties, facile processing routes and commerciallyrelevant PCEs.2 An important 
focus of current perovskite research is the substitution of lead for less toxic tin.3 Sn(II) has a 5s2 
valence electron configuration, analogous to the 6s2 configuration of Pb(II).4 Tin based perovskites 
typically display narrower band gaps and may avoid the need for encapsulation, which is necessary 
for Pbbased perovskites.5 
Sn based perovskites have shown a significant increase in photovoltaic efficiency in the past decade, 
but one of the key challenges is control of oxidation state.

Description:
More susceptible to oxidation than Pb(II) due to lower effective nuclear charge.

Text:
Sn(II) is more susceptible to oxidation 
than Pb(II), as the valence electrons of Sn experience lower effective nuclear charge than those of its 
heavier congener. In addition to the energetic driving force for this oxidation, Lanzetta et al. demonstrated the significance of I2 generation in SnPSCs, which leads to a cyclic degradation with 
detrimental selfdoping resulting in a ptype perovskite layer.6 These fundamental studies of the 
degradation of the active layer have thus far proved useful in designing a road map for mitigating 
oxidation. Use of additives and compositional engineering is a common strategy to inhibit Sn 
oxidation in PSCs.710 For example, addition of small amounts of SnF2, Sn metal and NH4SCN which 
can act as reducing agents without fundamentally changing the perovskite morphology.
