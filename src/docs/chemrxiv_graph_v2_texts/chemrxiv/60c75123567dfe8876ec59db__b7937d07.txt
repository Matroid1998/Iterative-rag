Description:
Exhibits better biocompatibility and biostability for medical applications.

Text:
Possibility to use different hard and soft segments for synthesizing polyurethane 
22 
to achieve desired properties made them versatile and tunable polymers. For example, different kind of polyurethanes 
23 
such as polycarbonate urethane, urethane acrylates, polyurethane polyols, polyester urethane, and polyether urethane 
24 
have been synthesized by changing the soft segment (Polyol groups) and have been used in different applications 23
25 
33. Among aforementioned synthetic polyurethanes, recent studies have been shown that polycarbonate based 
26 
urethanes have better biocompatibility and biostability than other kinds of polyurethanes for medical applications 
27 
which was correlated to higher stability of the soft segments (polycarbonate) inside of the body 34.
