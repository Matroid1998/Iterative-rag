Description:
The synsyn and antianti conformations promote A and C domains respectively.

Conformational 
defects impact upon the A or C state in polyaniline 
and exert memory effects.9 The synsyn and antianti 
conformations of the furandicarboxylate moiety pro
mote A and C domains respectively, in poly(butylene
2,5furandicarboxylate).10 The thiophene content in 
poly(3hexylthiophenecothiophenes) shows an in
verse correlation with the degree of crystallinity,11 and 
the ratio between diketopyrrolopyrrole and benzodi
thiadiazole units was used to tune the crystallinity in 
random copolymers based on them.12 The A state is 
often beneficial for pharmaceutical compounds; a 
study of celecoxib showed that while the C form had 
an ordered network of Hbonds involving all the elec
tron donor groups, the A form showed relatively 
stronger Hbonding interactions.13 
Enhanced luminescence in aggregates, supramo
lecular assemblies and the solid phase of select ma
terials, in contravention of the generally expected 
concentration quenching effects, is a phenomenon of 
special interest.
