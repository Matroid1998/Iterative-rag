Description:
An oxidant that reacts with phenolic compounds in the atmosphere to form secondary organic aerosol.

Biomass burning events, including wildfires, can emit large amounts of phenolic compounds, such 
as guaiacol, catechol, and syringol into the atmosphere.15 Once in the atmosphere, phenolic 
compounds can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals (OH), ozone (O3), and nitrate radicals (NO3) to 
form lower volatility products, which can partition to the particle phase, forming secondary organic 
aerosol (SOA).2,617 OH and O3 are the main oxidants during the day, while NO3 and O3 are the 
main oxidants during the night or during the day in lightlimited environments, such as within 
dense biomass burning plumes.16,18 A recent study suggests that oxidation of biomass burning 
plumes by NO3 during the night can lead to rapid production of SOA in the atmosphere.19 
SOA, including phenolic SOA can impact climate indirectly by acting as cloud condensation 
nuclei and possibly ice nucleating particles, thereby changing the reflectivity and lifetime of 
clouds.2023 In addition, SOA can contribute to poor air quality and negatively impact human 
health.2426 
Viscosity is a physiochemical property of SOA that is important for predicting its impact on 
climate and air quality.27 Viscosity is inversely related to molecular diffusion rates within SOA 
particles, based on the StokesEinstein equation.28 As a result, viscosity can impact gasparticle 
partitioning and the mass and size distributions of SOA in the atmosphere.2940 In addition, 
viscosity can affect the rates and mechanisms of multiphase reactions within SOA particles36,4153 
and the longrange transport of particleborne pollutants like polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons.41,5457 Some studies have also suggested that highly viscous SOA can act as 
heterogeneous nuclei for ice formation in the atmosphere,23,5863, although the importance of the 
glassy phase state for ice nucleation is still a matter of debate.64 
Many studies have quantified the viscosity of SOA generated with OH or O3.
