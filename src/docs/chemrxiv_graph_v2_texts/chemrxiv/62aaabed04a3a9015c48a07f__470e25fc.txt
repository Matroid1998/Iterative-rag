Organolithium reagents play an important role in organic synthesis due to their high 
reactivity that warrants versatile applications.1 Accordingly, many methods have been 
developed for generating organolithium species, including lithiation at carbonheteroatom 
bonds, deprotonation at acidic CH bonds, and addition of lithium reagents across unsaturated 
bonds.

Species of paramount importance in chemical synthesis.

Text:
In light of the paramount importance of organolithium species, organodilithium 
species that have two carbonlithium bonds in a single molecule should be fascinating, 
especially in the construction of cyclic frameworks.2 However, the generation of such 
dilithium species often encounters difficulty (Scheme 1) A) doubly prefunctionalized 
precursors, mostly dihalides, are much less readily available; B) the second lithiation is more 
difficult than the first one and unwanted intramolecular reductive CCbond formation can thus 
precede the second lithiation; C) the dilithiated species generated under harsher conditions are 
thus unstable and highly reactive, which limits the variety of useful dilithium species. Scheme 1. Difficulty in generating dilithium species.
