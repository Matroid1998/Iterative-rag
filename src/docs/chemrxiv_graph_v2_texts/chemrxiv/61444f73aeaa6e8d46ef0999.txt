The crystal structure of one of the most wellknown analgesics, acetylsalicylic acid, commonly 
38 
referred to under its trade name aspirin, was first characterised by Wheatley in 1964.1 After the 
39 
initial crystal structure was determined, it was widely discussed whether other crystal forms of 
40 
aspirin may exist, but it was not until 2005 that Vishweshwar et al.

Description:
Exists in polymorphs, including forms I and II, which can intergrow as single crystals.

reported the crystal structure 
41 
of aspirin form II.2 The form II structure had been identified as an energy minimum by Ouvrard 
42 
and Price3 in a crystalstructure prediction exercise, but suboptimal features of the experimental 
43 
structure determination left doubts over the validity of the crystal structure and the existence of 
44 
form II as a discrete polymorph.4 The origin of these difficulties was explained by Bond et al., 
45 
who showed that aspirin forms I and II exist as intergrown single crystals, comprising domains 
46 
of both structure types.5 Reproducible crystallisation of form II remained challenging, but it was 
47 
shown in 2010 that domains of the second polymorph of aspirin are introduced reliably in the 
48 
presence of aspirin anhydride during the crystallisation process.6 More polymorphs of aspirin 
49 
have since been discovered.7

In this paper, we focus on the closelyrelated aspirin polymorphs, form I and form II.
