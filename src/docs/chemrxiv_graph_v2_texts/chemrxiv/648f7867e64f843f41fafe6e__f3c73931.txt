Description:
A substrate containing an amino group used in hyperpolarization studies.

Text:
SABREbased hyperpolar
ization can be generated quickly (buildup of hyperpolariza
tion in seconds compared to minuteshours for DNP) and,
importantly, in situ inside NMR spectrometers 23,24. SABRE is based on spinorder transfer from parahydro
gen (pH2)a nuclear spin isomer of hydrogen gas 25to
a substrate of interest that can undergo reversible associ
ation with a polarization transfer catalyst (PTC), see Fig
ure 1a. For this study, we chose four substrates (with natu
ral isotopic abundance of 13C and 15N nuclei) containing
aminogroups
benzylamine, phenylethylamine (phenethy
lamine), 4aminopyridine, and ammonia (Fig. 1b). These
molecules are present in various biological and industri
ally important samples and their hyperpolarization and in
situ detection by benchtop NMR spectroscopy would signif
icantly accelerate the analysis.

Description:
A valuable precursor in the synthesis of pesticides, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals.

Text:
For example, benzylamine is
a valuable precusor in the synthesis of pecticides, fertilizers,
and pharmaceuticals 26 as well as a convenient molecule to
relay hyperpolarization to other substrates containing ex
changeable protons 27,28. These SABRErelay properties
also apply to phenethylamine that plays an important role in
biochemical processes 29. 4Aminopyridine is an approved
drug for multiples sclerosis and discussed in the context of
neuroprotective properties 3032. Ammmonia is a special
molecule in its application potential. Apart from its in
dustrial signicance, it is of paramount importance in the
context of green energy production, as it is currently be
ing explored for hydrogen storage in the powertoammonia
processes 33,34.
