Description:
A complex and less studied mycotoxin.

A few methods have recently been proposed 
to predict enzyme promiscuity based on the similarity theory, assuming the substrates catalyzed 
by an enzyme generally possess similar structural characteristics 19. However, being limited by 
poor generalization abilities, these methods cannot yield reliable results for complex and less
studied molecules, such as mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) (Fig S1). Another strategy used to identify functional enzymes for the catalysis of a specific biochemical 
reaction is predicting enzyme commission (EC) numbers based on sequence characteristics 20; 
however, this strategy only applies to common reactions involved in the EC system. For complex 
molecules and lessstudied reactions, no effective computational method exists to identify their 
catalytic enzymes. The feasibility of enzymatic reactions is determined by complex interactions 
between enzymes and substrates.
