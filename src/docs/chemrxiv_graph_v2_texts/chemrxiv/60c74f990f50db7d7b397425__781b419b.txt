Description:
A structure that is typically nonluminescent due to non-radiative decay pathways upon excitation.

Synthetic organic chromophores are commonly featured with extended conjugation and 
closedshell structure, but their synthesis could be tedious and challenging9. Most of the 
radicals with openshell structure are not stable, and diligent efforts have been made to stabilize 
the unpaired electron by delicate structure design10,11. Yet they typically relax via a non
radiative decay pathway upon excitation, thereby showing nonluminescent property5. Since 
the first reported case in 200612, luminescent radicals have been widely investigated from 
excitedstates dynamicsmechanisms13,14 to applications1517. Nevertheless, luminescence from 
stable radicals remains a sporadic phenomenon and most of the structures are limited to 
triphenyl methyl radical derivatives and their analogues7,1821.
