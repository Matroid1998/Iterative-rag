Description:
A component of syngas used by acetogenic bacteria to produce biofuels and biochemicals.

Semiartificial photosynthesis merges synthetic and biological approaches to produce sustainable fuels using 
sunlight, particularly excelling in selective multicarbon product formation via biocatalysis.1,2 A hybrid solar water 
splittingbiosynthetic system has been reported, where intermediate green H is used as a reductant to fix CO
and efficiently produce biomass and fuels using Cupriavidus necator.3 Coupling a synthetic photocatalyst with She
wanella oneidensis resulted in selective hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds.4 The photosensitization of Moorella 
thermoacetica with extracellular CdS or intracellular gold nanoclusters established a novel pathway for photocata
lytic CO utilization, integrating microbial systems with nanomaterials to enhance photosynthetic efficiency.5,6
Gas fermenting acetogenic bacteria, particularly Clostridium species, have emerged as versatile platforms for 
producing biofuels and biochemicals from syngas, a mixture of H, CO and CO2.79 These Clostridium strains utilize 
the WoodLjungdahl pathway, which consists of two branches (Figure 1A) to produce the C2 compounds the 
methyl branch, reducing CO to formate and further to a methyl group, and the carbonyl branch, which forms an 
acetyl group from CO. Clostridium ljungdahlii (Cl) has shown promise in fermenting these gases into valuable prod
ucts, underscoring the economic viability of this approach in biotechnology.
