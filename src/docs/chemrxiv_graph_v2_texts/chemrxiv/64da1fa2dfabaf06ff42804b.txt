Description:
Compounds with high persistence and bioaccumulation.

Text:
Most individual toxicity studies of PFASs were designed for 
legacy PFAS that are already or will be phased out, mostly C4C12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic 
acids (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFOS), instead of the emerging PFAS with 
unclear structure or property, mostly commercial15. On the other hand, the PFASs having high
throughput screening activity data available in public databases (i.e., PubChem and ChemBL) are 
actually druglike small molecules that contains aromatic groups and no more than three CF3 or 
CF2 groups, which are not the typical PFAS with high persistence and bioaccumulation.
