Description:
An MN4 species compared to NiN4 for selectivity toward CO production.

Text:
Recent attention has turned to dblock carbonsupported singleatom catalysts (SACs), 
a prototypical MN4 moiety with a local planarlike D4h symmetry, which can activate 
CO2 molecules due to their rich dorbital electrons transferring to the unoccupied  
orbital of CO2, showing promise in eCO2RR activity and selectivity.79 Of particular 
interest is the dispersed NiN4 site, which significantly reduces the energy barrier for 
CO desorption during eCO2RR, leading to a high selectivity toward CO production 
compared to other MN4 species such as CoN4 or FeN4.1012 Nevertheless, the pristine 
NiN4active site characterized with a highly symmetrical electron configuration 
demands higher overpotentials to promote the adsorption of reactants and COOH 
intermediates in CO2toCO transformation.13 The higher overpotential represents the 
higher energy required beyond the thermodynamically necessary level, thus impeding
