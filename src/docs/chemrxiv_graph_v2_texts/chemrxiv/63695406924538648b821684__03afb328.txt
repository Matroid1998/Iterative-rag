Description:
A functional group installed on heteroaromatic rings through CH borylation.

Text:
The catalytic CH functionalisation of aromatic heterocycles is a powerful method in synthesis. Within 
this field, CH borylation has proven a remarkably adept methodology.15 This reaction transforms a 
CH bond into a CB bond, allowing installation of boronic ester or boronic acid functional groups on 
heteroaromatic rings.
