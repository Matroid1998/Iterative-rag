Description:
Used as a hydrogen carrier with advantages such as ease of liquefaction at room temperature and higher volumetric density compared to liquid hydrogen.

The electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is a promising method for sustain
able energy generation either directly through fuel cells or indirectly as a hydrogen carrier.13
Ammonia, when used as a hydrogen carrier, offers several advantages, such as the availability
of storage and transportation facilities worldwide, ease of liquefaction at room temperature,
and higher volumetric density compared to liquid hydrogen.4 In contrast to water electrol
ysis, which is the second most popular method for hydrogen generation globally, the AOR
requires significantly less energy while water electrolysis demands 180 MJ of energy to
produce 1 kg of H2, the AOR only requires 33 MJ to produce the same amount of H2.2
Additionally, the AOR holds potential as an alternative to current ammonia remedia
tion techniques.
