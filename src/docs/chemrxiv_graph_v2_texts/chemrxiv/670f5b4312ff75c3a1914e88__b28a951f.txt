Description:
A gasotransmitter that acts as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor responsible for vein and artery dilation.

Text:
Gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), 
and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are toxic to living organisms at 
high concentrations, yet they can serve as important signal
ing molecules when present at low concentrations.1 As such, 
these socalled gasotransmitters induce physical and chem
ical transformations essential to the functioning of the hu
man body. For example, NO, the first gasotransmitter iden
tified in 1987,2 serves as the endotheliumderived relaxing 
factor that is responsible for vein and artery dilation. Rec
ognizing the potential of these gases in signaling pathways, 
researchers started investigating their potential and deliv
ery as therapeutics.
