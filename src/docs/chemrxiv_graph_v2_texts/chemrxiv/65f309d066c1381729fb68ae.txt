Description:
A compound involved in spectacular combustion reactions.

Among the ones who answered the first question, some recall Brownian motion, which is an 
acceptable correct answer; others invoke strange experiments such as spectacular combustion 
reaction with potassium dichromate or similar; lastly, Heisenberg and quantum mechanics is 
another response but is inappropriate because the existence of atom and molecules was 
demonstrated since at least 60 years then! About the second question, most respond  Dalton , 
but no one shows how he did. These results obtained are quite alarming. It looks like some fundamentals of chemistry 
history have been forgotten. This process can be justified by the fact modern chemistry is 
already almost 240 years old if we put Lavoisier as a starting point, and of course, the more 
time passes, the more chemical knowledge increases.
