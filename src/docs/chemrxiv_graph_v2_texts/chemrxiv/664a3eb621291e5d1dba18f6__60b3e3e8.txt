functional groups enhance the Lewis acidbase interactions and polarize the gC3N4 lattices, 
leading to the enormous enhancement, roughly 7 times from the optimal samples compared to 
pristine gC3N4 in pure water via piezophotocatalysis. Meanwhile, we also observed the 
correlation between the charge separation kinetic and the crystalline degree of the synthesized 
materials, which can elucidate how the nitrogen defects impacted the catalytic outcomes. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanisms were thoroughly studied, with the formation of H2O2 
proceeding via radical and water oxidation pathways, in which the roles of light and ultrasound 
were carefully investigated.
