Description:
Forms chains and fullerenes observed in the interstellar medium.

Since the detection of the first interstellar molecules,2,3,4 the question arose as to how small molecules 
evolve into complex organic molecules and prebiotic systems.5 Many theories and concepts have been 
formulated to explain and understand how chemical diversity and complexity increased through the 
reaction of small molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM).6,7,8 To date, more than 300 molecules 
ranging from small to large (carbon chains, fullerenes) molecules as well as radicals and ions have been 
observed in the ISM.9 Some of these molecules, like CO, CO2 or NH3, are stable terrestrial compounds, 
while others are highly reactive and transient species.

Description:
A component of small nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds of interest for prebiotic systems.

12 The 
handling of such small molecules, radicals and ions is usually difficult, if not impossible, in bulk solutions 
due to their notorious reactivity, which often results in uncontrolled follow up reactions.13 
Small nitrogen and oxygen containing carbon compounds are of particular interest for the evolution or 
prebiotic systems since they are assumed to be precursors to the molecules of life such as amino acids 
or nucleobases.14 One of these molecules is cyanoketene (1), which may add water to form amino 
acids. While several N and Ocontaining organic molecules have been observed in the ISM (Fig.
