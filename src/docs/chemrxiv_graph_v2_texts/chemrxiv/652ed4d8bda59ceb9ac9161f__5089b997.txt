Description:
A type of plastic mainly used in bottles and subject to mechanical recycling.

Global rates of plastic production, today reaching 400 million tonnes per year 29, reuqire compre
hensive and reliable plastic waste management systems 31. While industry reports manufacturing
process improvements 1, total plastic production and demand (particularly singleuse plastics) con
tinues to grow and overall plastic recycling rates remain well below 10 21. The bulk of plastic
wastes are currently incinerated, landlled, or allowed to accumulate in the environment 16. Traditional plastic recycling by mechanical methods is a mature pathway but faces signicant
inadequacies as a waste management strategy because it can only accept limited types of plastics
(mainly bottles of polyethylene terephthalatePET and highdensity polyethyleneHDPE), which rep
resent less than 12 of postconsumer plastic waste 23.
