Toxic molecules used primarily as pesticides and nerve agents.

Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) is a bacterial enzyme that can detoxify a wide range of organophos
phorus (OP) agents by hydrolyzing various phosphorusester bonds (PO, PF, PCN, and PS). OP com
pounds are toxic molecules used primarily as pesticides and nerve agents. OP compounds cause severe
neurotoxic eects by covalently binding to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that catalyzes the
breakdown of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine. Binding by OP inhibits AchE, resulting in accu
mulation of neurotransmitter and rapid death in insects and humans due to lost control of respiratory
muscles (Petroianu 2010). Current medical countermeasures, including atropine and oximebased re
activators (Lotti 2010) that target the downstream pathways of OP, act through reactivation of AChE,
blocking acetylcholine receptor activity or simply easing the symptoms.
