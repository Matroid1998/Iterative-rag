Description:
Forms intermolecular interactions known as halogen bonds, which are elastic.

However, SCO complexes with abrupt transitions 
result in dramatic changes in their properties, and are excellent 
prototypes for use in molecular sensors, switches, data storage 
or spintronics.6,7 To achieve abrupt SCO, strong interactions 
between the SCO centres, the socalled cooperativity, are 
required with two different strategies employed the polymeric 
approach, where covalent bonds are used to directly connect 
the spin sites,8,9 and the supramolecular approach, where 
intermolecular interactions are promoted (, hydrogen and 
halogen bonds), which have the advantage of being more 
elastic.1012 These interactions are responsible for transmitting 
structural distortions along the crystal as the spin transition 
occurs. In most cases, this results in a singlestep spin transition.
