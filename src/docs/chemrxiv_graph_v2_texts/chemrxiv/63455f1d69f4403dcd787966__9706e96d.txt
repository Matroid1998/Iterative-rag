Description:
A surface used to study the adsorption energy and site competition of water and aromatic molecules.

The nearchemisorption of water needs
to be properly described in terms of energy, adsorption
site and orientational preference of water relative to the
local surface of the NP.15 We recently proposed GAL, a
metalwater force eld that includes an angular depen
dence and an attractive Gaussian to localize the water on
the appropriate adsorption site on a Pt(111) surface.16
Since GAL17 captures the nearchemisorption of water
on Pt(111), it is able to describe the competition for ad
sorption sites between the solvent and other adsorbates. Therefore, GAL17 was used to assess the impact of solva
tion on the adsorption energy of aromatic molecules on
Pt(111), leading to a semiquantiative agreement with
experiment.17 Indeed, for the determination of solvation
