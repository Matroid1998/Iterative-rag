Description:
Used in catalysis with hypervalent iodine-derived radicals.

with DFT calculations 
shining light on the sequence of intermediate reaction steps.9 In a more 
complex scenario, the MacMillan group developed a radical sorting 
mechanism of unsymmetrical hypervalent iodinederived radicals with nickel 
catalysis which operated under an energy transfer mechanism with 
thioxanthone 
(TXO) 
and 
a 
SET 
mechanism 
with 
2,4,5,6tetrakis(9Hcarbazol9yl)isophthalonitrile 
(4CzIPN) 
as 
photocatalysts respectively.10 To this end, it is not clear how distinct this 
differentiation can be made. In 2023, the group of Murakami reported a 
detailed study where they found switching behavior of mechanisms with 
hypervalent iodine reagents.11 Following SET reactivity, an ionic pathway 
led to decarboxylative esterification, whereas EnT resulted in radicalradical 
homodimerization.
