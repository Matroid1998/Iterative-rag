In a nota
ble study, Rosseinskys group compared the conformational 
energy landscape of a threedimensional chiral MOF with 
flexible macromolecules, such as human hemoglobin9, re
vealing that flexible MOFs exhibit properties closely resem
bling those of biological macromolecules. In 2010, Yaghi introduced a new concept known as multi
variate (MTV) MOFs 10, which was further developed into 
the concept of sequences11. The first studies showed that a 
rigid platform like MOF5 can incorporate a large number of 
different functionalities, up to eight, through linking groups. Some of the properties of these materials do not just repre
sent additive effects of components; for instance, one MTV 
MOF5 demonstrates a 400 improvement in selectivity for 
carbon dioxide compared to its individual components.
