Description:
Used as a solvent in the synthesis of nanomaterials.

Text:
With band gaps ranging from 1.65
eV to 3.7 eV depending on the crystal phase reported in
the literature (5, 6), In2S3 could be used in a variety of
optoelectronic applications such as buffer layers in photo
voltaics (7), in display devices and photodetectors (812),
or for water splitting (13). Although research on indium
sulde colloidal nanoparticles has been quite active in the
past years, notably in the exploration of different synthetic
pathways, only partial shape control has been achieved to
date. For example, several reports describe the synthesis
of 1D nanomaterials such as long nanotubes (14) using
InCl3 and sulfur in oleylamine, while ditertbutyl disulde
and indium acetylacetonate in oleylamine yield In2S3
nanorods with a mean length of 170 nm (15).

Description:
Used as a medium for the synthesis of smaller hexagonal In2S3 nanoplates from InCl3 and thiourea.

As far as 2D
nanomaterials are concerned, Park et al. have rst reported
the colloidal synthesis of In2S3 hexagonal nanoplates (8)
while the Pradhan group obtained large (1 m) indium
sulde nanosheets through the thermal decomposition of
indium trisdiethyldithiocarbamate in hexadecylamine (16). Similar wrinkled nanosheets have been observed as transient
intermediates towards smaller (60 nm) hexagonal In2S3
nanoplates when InCl3 and thiourea are used as precursors
in oleylamine (17). Shape control can also be achieved
using other strategies without varying the precursor sources
Ni et al. obtained nanotubes from the selfassembly of
ultrathin nanocoils synthesized from indium acetate and
sulfur in octylamine (18, 19), whereas Tian et al.
