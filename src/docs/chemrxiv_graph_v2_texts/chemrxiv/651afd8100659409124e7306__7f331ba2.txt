Description:
A surface minority species responsible for dynamic, reversible conversion to an oxyhydroxide.

Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF), was proposed to be extremely active based on its optimal eg electron 
count of around unity5, but was later found to be unstable during OER9. Large proportions of the surface 
and eventually parts of the bulk amorphized via Srleaching and oxygenvacancy formation forming an 
highly OER active Co(Fe)OxHy surface phase,9 similar to that made by other methods such as 
electrodeposition10. In a related study, a surface CoFe spinel oxide minority species on the underlying 
BSCF perovskite was determined to be responsible for dynamic, reversible conversion to an 
oxyhydroxide11.
