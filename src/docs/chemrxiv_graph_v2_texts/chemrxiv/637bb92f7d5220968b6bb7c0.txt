Description:
Generates sulfur radical anions or thiosulfate when reacting with bases.

Similarly, carbonbased nucleophiles usually 
provide products with the incorporation of a single sulfur atom, for example in the Gewald1416 or Willgerodt
Kindler17 reactions.18 Nitrogenbased nucleophiles are often proposed to open S8 as part of complex mechanisms, 
1, 2 oxygen bases generate sulfur radical anions19, 20 or thiosulfate, 21 while hydrogen sulfide and thiols react with 
sulfur to form complex mixtures of polysulfides. 2226 In most cases, opening of S8 by the nucleophile is believed to 
be ratedetermining, therefore the productdetermining steps are kinetically invisible and thus still poorly 
characterized. Indeed, experimental investigations of polysulfide mechanisms are complicated by their 
thermodynamic instability2730 and recent evidence shows that they interconvert faster than they are trapped by 
chemical probes.
