chain, leaving the latter in a pdoped state.13 Microscopic de
tails including inter and intrachain processes were ilucudated by
use of atomistic quantum chemical approaches,19 and detailed
studies of the chemical complexes involved in this process.20 A
similar process is believed to account for electrophilic attack p
type doping by use of TrTPFB molecules.
