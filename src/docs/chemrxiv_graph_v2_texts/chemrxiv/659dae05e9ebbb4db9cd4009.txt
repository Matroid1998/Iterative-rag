Text:
Dihydroxanthones are rare in nature due to their instability 
towards aromatization and reduction. Though frequently pro
posed as key intermediates in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthe
sis,1 only a limited number of dihydroxanthones have been 
isolated as stable natural products. Nidulalin A (1),2 a dihy
droxanthone, dienone natural product, showed potent inhibi
tion against DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) (IC50  2.2 M) 
and cytotoxicity,3 was isolated along with related congeners 
including 2Hnidulalin A derivatives 2 and 3 (Figure 1A).4 
Nidulalin B (4) was a coisolated benzophenone natural prod
uct2 which underscores the propensity towards aromatization 
of 1.
