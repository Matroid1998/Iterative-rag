Description:
A sulfur analogue of Li4P2Se6, with a structure potentially differing due to aliovalent doping with magnesium.

Only a single ternary crystalline phase in the system LiPSe is currently known,
corresponding to the hightemperature modification of Li7PSe6.2 This compound
crystallizes in the wellknown cubic argyrodite structure and exhibits fast Liion
conductivity, similar to its sulfurbased analogue.3 Efforts to enhance the ionic
conductivity of this phase through aliovalent substitution with different elements have been
reported.4,5 Additionally, a previous study provided strong evidence for another
crystalline phase, Li4P2Se6, based on solidstate NMR and powder Xray diffraction data,
including a suggested unit cell, however, its structure remained unsolved.6 A key
question to be addressed is whether the crystalline Li4P2Se6 adopts the same structure
as its sulfur analogue, Li4P2S6.7,8
A previous study 9 on aliovalent doping of Li4P2S6 with magnesium demonstrated that
several energetic minima can be accessed by only minor compositional changes,
suggesting that the structure of Li4P2Se6 could well differ from the sulfur variant.
