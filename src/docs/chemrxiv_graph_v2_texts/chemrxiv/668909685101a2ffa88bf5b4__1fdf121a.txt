Description:
An aromatic compound that can be polyfunctionalized and studied for its molecular geometry and directive influence of substituents.

Text:
By the end of the 19th century, it was already possible to
find literature analyzing changes in physical properties of ben
zene when monosubstituted with different functional groups,
such as the magnetic rotatory power1. Shortly thereafter, a lit
tle more than one hundred years ago, studies began to emerge
conducting morphological comparisons of benzene based on
the nature and orientation of various substituents28. Surpris
ingly, the interest in the molecular geometry of substituted
benzene derivatives persisted until the late years of the 20th
century912. Because of the necessity to polyfunctionalize
benzene to specific preferences, exploration into the directive
influence of substituents on the benzene ring intensified dur
ing the 1920s1318, thanks to which the foundations were laid
for modern organic synthesis involving aromatic compounds.

Description:
An aromatic compound studied for its chemical and physical properties in relation to substituent characteristics.

Text:
During this and the subsequent decades, researchers delved
deeper into understanding the chemical and physical prop
erties of benzene and other aromatic compounds in relation
to substituent characteristics. Among all the studies, those
relating the substituents of different aromatic compounds to
reactivity19,20, dielectric constants21,22, optical activity2325,
and even toxicity2628 could be referenced.

Description:
Analyzed for its reduction and ionization potentials based on substituents.

However, accord
ing to the purpose of this study, it is important to highlight
the plethora of research analyzing the reduction and ioniza
tion potentials of benzene and related compounds based on
the nature and orientation of various substituents4351. With the arrival of the 21st century, the study of other
properties of benzene and related aromatic systems in
terms of substituents continued generating interest, such as
aromaticity52,53. This type of systematic studies relating the
substituents of aromatic compounds to their features has been
extended even to isoelectronic systems based on boron instead
of carbon54,55, as well as to the intermolecular interactions be
tween the substituted aromatic compounds themselves5659,
forming dimers.

Description:
In the case of benzene dimer, the most stable structure is stabilized mainly by dispersion energy.

Text:
These stable
disposals are typically the following sandwich (monomers
parallel), paralleldisplaced, Tshaped (monomers perpendic
ular) and Tshaped tilted.63 From the literature, it can be ex
tracted that all these arrangements are mainly stabilized by
dispersion energy, although some other specific interactions
can help to make the conformation even more stable.64 In
the case of benzene dimer, the most stable structure corre
