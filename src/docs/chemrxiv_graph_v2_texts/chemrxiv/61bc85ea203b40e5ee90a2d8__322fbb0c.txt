Description:
A compound with 1H and 2H tautomers identifiable using Linear Free Energy Relationships and pKa values.

Text:
In the present study we have 
shown for the first time without using expensive and timeconsuming methods like 1H NMR, 
13C NMR and dipole meters, a simple novel protocol is just handy to identify the 1H and 2H 
tautomers of tetrazole hitherto not reported earlier with the use of Linear Free Energy 
Relationships (LFER) knowing experimentally determined pKa values 2 and DFTB3LYP 
method at the 631G level calculated dipole moments 3. And mimicking of principle of 
structurefunction study on a chemical and a physical property for the first time is observed. Methods 
All the linear correlations were done using the KaleidaGraph software, Reading, PA, 
USA. The chemical structures are drawn using chemdraw.
