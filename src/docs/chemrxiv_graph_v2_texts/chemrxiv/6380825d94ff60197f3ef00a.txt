Description:
Used as a membrane material in protein macroarrays for proteomic studies.

Text:
Protein arrays are a wellestablished proteomic tool for the simultaneous analysis of thousands of 
interaction partners, generally manufactured in an microarray format through immobilization of 
purified proteins on chemically modified microscope slides 1. An alternative to the microarray 
format are protein macroarrays produced by printing of annotated libraries of E.coli clones, 
expressing recombinant human protein, on large 2222cm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 
membranes 2, 3. Since their introduction in the early 2000 the protein macroarrays have been 
frequently used with around 100 published studies in a wide range of applications from protein
protein 4, 5, peptideprotein 6, 7, enzymesubstrate 8, 9 and posttranslational modification 
interaction studies 10, 11, to antibody specificity validation 12, 13, antibody target discovery 
14, 15, antibody isotyping 1618 and clinical autoantibody screening 11, 16, 19.
