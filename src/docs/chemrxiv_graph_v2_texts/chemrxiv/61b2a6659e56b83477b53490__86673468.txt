Description:
Oxidized to produce benzaldehyde using oxidants like chromic acid, dichromate, and permanganate.

As important chemical products, benzaldehyde or benzoic acid is widely used in 
perfumes, dyes, and pharmaceutical intermediates1. At present, the preparation 
methods of benzaldehyde mainly include the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, the 
oxidation of toluene, and the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride2. Among them, benzyl 
alcohol oxidation is widely used because of its low cost. Commonly used oxidants or 
catalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol include chromic acid, dichromate, 
permanganate, and precious metal catalysts36. However, these oxidation methods 

have some disadvantages. For example, the waste generated from the used oxidant 
would pollute the environment and is prone to excessive oxidation. So, it is very 
important and necessary to find a green oxidant.
