. ()Colchicine (1, Figure 1A) is one of the worlds oldest known medicines, dating back to at least 
ancient Egypt, when its natural product source, the autumn crocus, was used for treatment of inflammation.1 In 
more recent times, the pure form of colchicine has been used as an FDAapproved drug most closely associated 
with gout, but also used for prevention of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever,2 and there is growing 
interest in other applications.3 For example, just this year the FDA approved colchicine for use in the prevention of 
cardiovascular disease.4 Colchicines broad value is generally tied to its microtubule destabilizing activity,5 which is 
the mechanism through which many of the most important and widely used chemotherapeutics work.

While 
colchicine is not currently used clinically as a chemotherapeutic due to its high toxicity, there is high active interest 
in the development of anticancer agents that target the colchicinebinding site of tubulin.6
