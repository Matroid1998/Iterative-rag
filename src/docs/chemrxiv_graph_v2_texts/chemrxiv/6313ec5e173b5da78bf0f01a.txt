Description:
Lacks the additional valley degree of freedom present in silicon.

Text:
Studies of silicon qubits are developing into a major re
search focus 14, due to their inherent long electron de
coherence times. However, the presence of the additional
valley degree of freedom (VDOF) introduces a higher de
gree of complexity (compared to cases where the VDOF
is absent, e.g., GaAs nanodevices 57) which has not
as yet been satisfactorily deciphered, experimentally or
theoretically. Indeed, a number of publications consider
it as a challenge to be overcome or to do away with (see,
e.g., Refs. 1, 810), whereas a second group of publica
tions (see, e.g., Refs. 1115) considers it as a potential
resource to be further explored. Experimental eorts in
both directions are intensely pursued, but a de nitive
resolution has not been reached as yet.
