Description:
Atoms that provide electrons to the covalently bonded anionic framework.

Text:
The chains of InAs4 
tetrahedra are further bridged by AsAs bonds. The Eu atoms 
between the chains provide electrons to the covalently bonded 
anionic framework, yielding an overall charge balance. Mssbauer 
spectroscopy suggests the valence state as Eu25In32As34As22, 
while Zintlconcept describes that as Eu25In2As4As22. This 
material undergoes twostep magnetic transitions at 5 K and 16 K, 
likely because of Eu2 ions that include three distinct 
crystallographic sites.29 
In this study, we demonstrate that Zintl arsenide Eu5In2As6 is a 
bipolar dopable material. La and Zn were used as the ntype and p
type dopants, respectively, because these elements have been
