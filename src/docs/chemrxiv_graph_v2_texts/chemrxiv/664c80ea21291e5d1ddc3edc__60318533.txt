Description:
Ligands that have been extensively studied for their structural design.

Text:
The structural design of transition metal carbene ligands has been 
excessively studied in the past decades.1 The common 
Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand group can be modified in 
several different ways, however, the structural tuning of more 
nucleophilic cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (CAAC)24 and related 
ligands (sixmembered CAAC,5 CAArC,6,7 BICAAC8) is 
associated with synthetic challenges. The first representatives of 
the CAACs were predominantly tuned by their (aminederived) N
substituent, showing important influence on the coordinated 
transition metals apparent catalytic activity.911 The variability of 
the aldehydederived alkyl part of the carbenes vicinity depends 
on the availability of the aldehyde synthetic equivalents, or the 
possible alphafunctionalization of the formed imine or enamine. Thus, the alpha carbon atom next to the carbene center can have 
various alkyl, aryl and spirocycloalkyl derivatives.
