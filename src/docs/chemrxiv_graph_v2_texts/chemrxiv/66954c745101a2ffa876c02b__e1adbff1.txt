100 fs,9,11,31,32 which causes a characteristic broad UV absorp
tion band in the gas phase.31 The most likely mechanistic expla
nation of this process is the transfer of a proton from the N1 atom
of guanine to the N3 atom of cytosine, which stabilizes the CT
state and eventually leads to a crossing with the ground state in
a barrierless manner.7,9,23,33
Although a direct photoinduced EDPT process is unlikely
in DNA,20 there are spectroscopic indications that it could
be possible within the AU pair in the Aform RNA dou
ble helix.34 The photochemistry of adenine complexes with
uracil (AU) or thymine (AT) has received less attention than
GC,10,13,15,16,27,35 and these have been studied mainly in
the context of the plausibility of the spurious EDPT deacti
vation mechanism.

A component of DNA that pairs with adenine.

Given the apparent similarities of uracil
and thymine34,3638 and according to ab initio calculations,
this mechanism should be possible in the WC base pair of
AT.10,16,23,39 However, its experimental verification was hin
dered due to a different equilibrium geometry assumed in the
gas phase.40,41 Also, recent computational results of Jouybari et
al.27 did not yield the population of the CT state in nonadiabatic
dynamics, which in this system is too far apart from the optically
accessible locally excited (LE) state in the FranckCondon region. Instead, the authors suggest that the main decay path of AT in
volves a LE 1transition on the thymine, which is consistent
with the experimental findings.
