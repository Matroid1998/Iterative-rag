Description:
A compound that can be functionalized with 1,2epoxybutane to reduce heat of adsorption and increase stability.

Text:
Modification of polyamines with 
epoxide groups has been explored previously as a method 
for 
enhancing 
sorbent 
properties.4046 
Choi 
et 
al. demonstrated that functionalizing poly(ethyleneimine) 
with 1,2epoxybutane reduces the heat of adsorption and 
increases the stability by altering the primary, secondary, 
and tertiary amine fractions.41, 47 Increasing the extent of 
functionalization 
increasingly 
benefits 
the 
heat 
of 
adsorption and stability, but it also negatively impacts the 
sorbents capacity.41 
It remains unclear which functional group and extent of 
functionalization 
result 
in 
the 
most 
economically 
advantaged DAC process, but we hypothesized based on
