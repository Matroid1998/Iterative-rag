Description:
Molecular oxygen can facilitate the formation of NOS bonds.

Text:
At rst, the formation of single
NOS bridges was reported.4,1720 However, it has re
cently been shown that further oxidation of the amino
moiety of the Lys is possible in the main protease of
SARSCoV2 (MP ro), leading to the formation of a dou
ble NOS bridge (SONOS).5,21
It has also been observed that NOS bonds can be
formed both in the presence of molecular oxygen and hy
drogen peroxide in solution, the latter being somewhat
faster.4 The exact identity and the breadth of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) which can bring about the reac
tion are unknown, given that the chemistry of ROS in
water are quite intricate.22 Take for example the recent
discovery of spontaneous hydrogen peroxide formation
in water microdroplets.23 We decided to focus foremost
on three potential agents  hydrogen peroxide,24 triplet
and singlet molecular oxygen25  which we hope will be
representative.
