Description:
An electronically insulating, highly fluorinated carbon.

Text:
Since the fluorination of materials such as La2(NiCo)O4 
is happening at potentials very similar to carbon fluorination , the two materials fluorinate 
simultaneously. Since carbon monofluoride (CF)n, PTFE (CF2)n and other analogous highly 
fluorinated carbons are all electronically insulating, the fluorination of the carbon additive was 
assumed to cause rapid capacity fading observed by Nowroozi et. al. 34 and Wissel et. al. 5, 
in agreement with observed changes in the carbon oxidation state from XPS studies. To differentiate the fluorination of La2(NiCo)O4 from the conductive additive, one option is to 
replace carbon by other conductive materials which show higher oxidative stability.
