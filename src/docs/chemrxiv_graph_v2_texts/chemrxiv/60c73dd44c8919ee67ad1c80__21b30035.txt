According to the importance of energy in the 
world, in this study it was tried to introduce an 
important class of materials with potentially be 
used in energy storage devices. One of the 
devices which has an important role in electrical
energy storage are capacitors, where they store 
energy in the separated electrical double layers 
in electrodes andor via reductionoxidation 
reactions. Electrical conductivity in the 
electrodes is known as a crucial property for 
electrodes that are used in many studies. Various materials such as graphene, carbon 
nanotube, metal oxides and conductive 
polymers have been employed as electrodes in 
supercapacitors.18
Another plausible way to improve the 
capacitance is the introduction of reduction and 
oxidation ability to the electrode material, 
which is called pseudocapacitance.
