Description:
Different carbon types can be identified using 13C NMR spectroscopy, which distinguishes Cq, CH, CH2, and CH3 groups.

In 13C NMR spectra, the socalled multiplicity, which is the number n of 
magnetically equivalent nuclei I bound to spin S, (InS group) is of special interest. Multiplicity supplies valuable information to unequivocally identify the signals of Cq, CH
, CH2 and CH3 groups and thus to obtain the number of the different carbon types for 
the molecule under study. Correspondingly designed 1D 13CNMR experiments such as 
APT,1,2 INEPT3 or DEPT4 have been introduced many years ago for this purpose. The option for multiplicity discrimination has also been incorporated into 2D 
experiments such as 2D HSQC5,6 and 3D protein NMR experiments.7 However, 1D 13C 
DEPT or APT are still the most common experiments for assigning 13C signals and for 
the elucidation of molecular structures on a routine level.
