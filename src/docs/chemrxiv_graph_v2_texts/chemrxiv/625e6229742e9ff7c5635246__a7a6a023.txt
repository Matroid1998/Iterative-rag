Description:
An acidic medium used in the study of catalytic activities of metals towards HER.

Text:
The differences in the catalytic activities of metals towards HER in an acidic medium (0.5M 
H2SO4) is assumed to be explainable via the Sabatier Principle.1 According to the Sabatier 
principle, HER activity depends on metalhydrogen (EMH) binding strength, which leads to 
a volcano type plot when using EMH as a descriptor of the activity of metals for HER.2 In 
this scenario, metals like Pt or Ptgroup metals are excellent electrocatalysts for HER due to 
their thermoneutrality for hydrogen adsorption (optimum metalhydrogen binding energy 
leads to EMH 0 eV).3 But this reasoning cannot be extended to the alkaline HER, 
particularly it fails to explain the sluggish reaction kinetics of HER on Pt in alkaline media.
