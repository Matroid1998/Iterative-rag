Description:
Involved in the oxidation of graphitic nanoparticles, with etching rates peaking in the 1200-1500 K range.

Text:
This behavior was attributed to the 
NPs initially having large, but highly variable numbers of under
coordinated surface sites, and that preferential sublimation at such 
sites reduces the numbers of such sites over time, reducing the 
rates, and modifying the optical properties.4 
We also reported a study of O2 oxidation of graphitic NPs.5 
Etching rates peaked in the 1200  1500 K range, dropping at 
higher TNP. Etching rates varied substantially from NPtoNP and 
fluctuated over time for individual NPs. Both effects were 
attributed to variations in the numbers of undercoordinated 
reactive sites on the NP surfaces, which evolved as the NPs etched.

Description:
An element that graphitic NPs become inert to in the 1200 to 1900 K range.

Text:
Surprisingly, it was also found that graphitic NPs eventually 
evolved to be essentially inert to O2 in the 1200 to 1900 K range, 
implying that the number of exposed reactive sites dropped to near 
zero. It was speculated that his evolution to O2 inertness resulted 
from a transformation of at least the surface layer, to nanoonion 
(multiwall fullerene) structure. This interpretation of the previous results, as well as results 
presented below, relies on extensive literature on oxidation of 
various forms of carbon, particularly graphite, some of which is 
discussed in the SI.

Description:
Has near-zero reactivity towards perfect graphite basal planes in a certain temperature range.

Text:
Briefly, etching is O2 dissociative adsorption, 
followed by COCO2 desorption, and the decrease at higher TNP has 
been attributed to competition from Oatom desorption.910 Surface 
chemistry studies have shown that perfect graphite basal planes 
have nearzero reactivity towards O2 in this temperature range,1112 
but etching is observed at sputterinduced basal plane defects1317 
and at prismatic surfaces,18 which expose basal plane edges. For 
example, Olander et al.11 observed etching at sputtered basal plane 
defects from 1400  1500 K at O2 fluxes of 100 O2 
collisionsecnm2, about 30 lower than our flux.

Description:
Used in etching processes, particularly with graphite, where it affects etching rates.

Text:
Etching at 
defects tends to expand the defects laterally, leading to 2D etch pit 
formation.1317 For example, Edel et al.17 studied pit formation 
during HOPG etching to peak at 1200  1400 K, using O2 fluxes of 
0.1 O2 collisionssecnm2. It is interesting to note that the TNP 
range where we observe the maximum etching rates is similar to 
the range seen in the surface chemistry experiments, but also in 
experiments with bulk graphite at much higher pressures. For 
example, Wall et al.19 observed the steady state etching rates for 
bulk graphite to peak between 1700  1900 K, and Rosner et al.20 
observed peaks in the 1500 to 1750 K range, with O2 partial
