Description:
Undergo CH functionalization via thianthrenation for dehydrogenation.

Text:
In 2023 we 
merged the CH functionalization of arenes via thi
anthrenation and deprotonative aryne generation for a net 
dehydrogenation of simple arenes as an efficient way to 
access arynes (Scheme 1c).11 In our early optimization, we 
found that aryl thianthrenium salts were more easily ac
cessed than aryl(Mes)iodonium salts and we therefore 
developed a twostep sequence in which the aryl thi
anthrenium salts were isolated and subsequently used as 
aryne precursors (Scheme 1c). Although the isolation of
