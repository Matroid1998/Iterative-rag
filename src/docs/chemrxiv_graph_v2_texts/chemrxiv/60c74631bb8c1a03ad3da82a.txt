Description:
A reaction used in the synthesis of thousands of compounds.

Text:
Examples of those reactions include classical name reactions such us Staudinger reaction, 
Schmidt reaction and Curtius rearrangement.13 Also, since the introduction of the copper (I) 
azidealkyne cycloaddition, thousands of compounds have been prepared.46 The absence of azide 
in nature and the inability of the biological machinery to transform azides have promoted this 
functional groups to the podium of the bioortogonal groups being applied on many different 
studies.710

Allylic azides are building blocks for the synthesis of natural products and nitrogencontaining 
heterocycles of pharmacological relevance.1114 Despite the importance of these useful synthons, 
their applicability in synthetic schemes has been difficult due to their existence as a regioisomeric 
mixture that interconverts rapidly at room temperature, being in general inseparable (Figure 1).15, 
16 The allylic azide rearrangement was first reported by Gagneux, Winstein, and Young in 1960 
(known as Winsteins rearrangement).15 They reported the equilibrium constant for the 
rearrangement of both crotyl and prenyl azide in several solvents.
