Description:
Fundamental components of biological membranes, forming bilayers and lyotropic phases.

Text:
As fundamental 
46 
components of the biological membrane, lipids and their mesoscale structures have informed our 
47 
understanding of the structure and activity of the bilayers in which they reside, and have been used 
48 
extensively as the basis of bottomup bioinspired systems.1 
49 
The most structurally exotic of these lyotropic lipid phases are the bicontinuous cubic phases, in 
50 
which a bilayer separates two interconnecting water channels, and can adopt geometries that are 
51 
based on the diamond (
), the primitive (
) and the gyroid (
) minimal surfaces, with 
52 
crystallographic space groups Pn3m, Im3m and Ia3d respectively (Figure 1).
