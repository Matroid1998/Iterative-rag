2D semiconductors such as monolayer (ML)MoS2 are 
attractive for photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion 
and photocatalysis applications because hot carriers (electrons 
and holes) produced from light absorption may immediately 
participate in interfacial charge transfer reactions. Atomically
thin electrodes could enable interfacial charge transfer of hot 
carriers that outcompetes charge carrier cooling,1 which 
represents a promising strategy to maximize solar energy 
conversion efficiency.2,3 Very recently, Austin et al. showed 
ultrafast (50 fs) hot exciton and free carrier extraction under 
applied bias in a proofofconcept photoelectrochemical solar 
cell.4 The exciting possibility of maximizing the energy 
conversion efficiency of this hot carrier process requires tuning 
the electron transfer kinetics.
