Description:
A component of carbonic anhydrases, which are enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide and water.

Text:
The carbonic anhydrases (CA) are a family of ubiquitous zinc enzymes which play a catalytic role in the 
reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to bicarbonate (HCO3) and a proton. (Supuran, 
2008) In humans, the carbonic anhydrase enzymes have 15 isoforms that vary by localization and catalytic 
activity including; the cytosolic CAs; CA I, CA II, CA III, CA VII, CA XIII; the membranebound CAs; CA IV, CA 
IX, CA XII, CA XIV, CA XV (not present in primates, only in rodents and other animalsfish); CA VA and CA VB 
are mitochondrial, and CA VI is secreted in saliva and colostrum. In addition, three catalytically inactive forms of 
CA are known (CA VIII, CA X, and CA XI) referred to as CA relatedproteins.
