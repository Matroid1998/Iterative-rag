Description:
A chemical element used in the formation of trihalomethanes (THM) and influenced by organics, pH, and time.

Text:
The formation of THM has been extensively researched and the key measures for controlling their 
formation are organics, chlorine, pH, and time (see Rook 1974). However, the most secure way to 
ensure compliance is to maximise the removal of precursor material i.e., natural organic matter 
(NOM). The preAMP3 process technology employed at both Oswestry and Watchgate were not 
capable of removing the required amounts of NOM in order to ensure compliance with the new 
regulatory requirements. Also, at Watchgate the existing filters could not reliably provide a robust 
barrier to Cryptosporidium without provision of the pretreatment. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023cdg6bv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000278297698 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
