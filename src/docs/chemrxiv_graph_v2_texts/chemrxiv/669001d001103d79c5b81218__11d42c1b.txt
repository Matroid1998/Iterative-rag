Description:
Used as a reducing agent in the synthesis of NiGraf.

In recent years, plentiful research efforts have 
been placed in increasing the activity of nickel, by coupling it with other elements 
and compounds 6,16. Among these structures, Graphene Oxide (GO) has 
attracted particular interest due to its conductivity, high surface area and high 
chemical and mechanical stability 17,18. In all these attempts, however, GO is 
used as support that is decorated with Nibased catalytic species. A 
complementary approach was recently adopted with the introduction of NiGraf, a 
new molecularly doped metal comprised of GO 3D entrapped in nickelbased 
jamborite (Ni(OH)2(NiOOH)) nanoparticles 19. The catalyst is reproducibly 
synthesized by a simple onepot procedure carried out in water starting from a Ni 
precursor salt, graphene oxide and sodium borohydride as reducing agent.
