Description:
A 2D material that achieves a capacity of 1,000 mAh g1.8 but suffers from irreversibility and poor cycling stability during initial cycles.

Text:
In our previous work, we demonstrated 
that 2D MoS2 achieves a capacity of 1,000 mAh g1.8 However, 2D MoS2 electrodes 
suffered from irreversibility during the first cycles and poor cycling stability. We 
demonstrated that this was due to activation processes, which consist of physical 
electrode transformations that led to an evolution of energy storage mechanisms. Conversionintercalation battery processes (first 2 cycles) evolved first into a 
combination of battery and pseudocapacitive processes, and subsequently, into a state 
dominated by pseudocapacitive and double layer capacitive processes.8 Importantly, 
these activation processes were ratedependent and led to a continuously growing 
capacity during cycling, which, provided that the cycling stability is improved, can be 
utilized in a high capacityhigh rate energy storage device .
