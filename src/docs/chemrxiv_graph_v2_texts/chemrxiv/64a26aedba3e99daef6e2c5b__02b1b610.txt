Description:
A modified Kdo substrate used for metabolic labeling in Gram-negative bacteria.

Text:
Several studies have used 
this modified Kdo substrate to metabolically label LPS in a selection of Gramnegative bacteria (Figure 
1).9,1318 Labeling experiments involve the uptake of Kdo8N3 inside the bacterial cytosol, where it is 
processed to the nucleotideactivated CMPKdo8N3 form. Next, Kdotransferase adds Kdo8N3 to the 
growing lipid A structure, after which the glycoconjugate is flipped to the extracellular surface. A 
subsequent click reaction with a fluorescent label allows the visualization of labeled LPS structures 
using SDSPAGE gel imaging and fluorescence microscopy on whole cells.

Description:
A chemically synthesized compound used to label LPS and visualize bacterial cell membranes using fluorescence microscopy.

Text:
In the first account in 2012, 
Kdo8N3 was chemically synthesized and used as a tool to label LPS and to selectively visualize the cell 
membrane of E. coli K12, Salmonella thyphimurium, and Legionella pneumophila strain Paris using 
fluorescence microscopy.9 Bacteria were incubated in a minimal medium (M9) with Kdo8N3 and 
subsequently reacted with a fluorophore through coppercatalyzed click chemistry. This method was 
further improved by growing the bacterial cells in a richer media (LB) supplemented with lower
