Description:
A family of dyes used in SWIR imaging that are hydrophobic and prone to aggregation.

Text:
A growing suite of SWIR imaging agents have re
cently been developed,5 with notable examples coming 
from the cyanines,610 xanthenes,11, 12 and BODIPY fam
ilies.13 However, these examples are hydrophobic and 
intrinsically prone to aggregation. While nanoparticle 
formulations can potentially offset these drawbacks, it 
is preferable to develop complementary SWIR dyes 
that do not require encapsulation for in vivo imaging. In 
this study, we strategically remodeled the hemicyanine 
dye (HD)14, 15 (a common NIR platform) for multimodal 
SWIR FL and PA imaging.
