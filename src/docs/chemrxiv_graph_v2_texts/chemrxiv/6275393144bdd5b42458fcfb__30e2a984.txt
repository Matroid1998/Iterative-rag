Description:
Synthesized using 3phenoxy ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate.

Text:
3Phenoxy ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) is reported in synthesis of 
tetrazoles 1; in the process for preparation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds via lipase
catalyzed 2, 3 and via triazinebased microporous network Knoevenagel condensations 
4; in imidazolium chloride immobilized SBA15 catalyzed condensation 5; in synthesis 
of pharmaceutically active pyranochromene compounds useful as antiviral agents 6. 3
Phenoxy ringsubstituted ethyl PCA is involved in DBUmediated 4  2 annulations of 
donoracceptor cyclopropanes with 3aryl2cyanoacrylates for the synthesis of fully 
substituted anilines 7; in studies on quinolin2(1H)one derivatives in synthesis of 
pyrano3,2c quinoline and 3substituted quinoline derivatives 8; in radical 
copolymerization with styrene 9; in synergistic NaBH4 reductioncyclization of 2
aroylcyclopropane1carboxylates leading to synthesis of 3oxabicyclo3.1.0hexane 
derivatives 10; in synthesis of azaindazoles as Btk kinase modulators 11.
