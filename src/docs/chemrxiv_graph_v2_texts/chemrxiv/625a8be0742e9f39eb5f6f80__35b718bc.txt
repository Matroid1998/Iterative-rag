Description:
Functionalize gate oxides in analytical simulations to calculate surface charge density.

METHODOLOGY 
The analytical simulations are used to calculate the 
zeta potential (), sensitivity factor () and 
intrinsic buffer capacity () values for all gate 
oxides 2. The following methodology is used for a 
particular gate oxide with or without functionalized 
with the amino acids. First, the surface charge 
density is calculated using the GouyChapman
Stern model and BoltzmannPoisson model (). Where, 

 , 
   10 , pHB is 
the bulk pH, o is the surface potential, NS is the 
total surface states, Ka  Kb are the dissociation 
constants of the corresponding reactive sites and VT 
is the thermal voltage. The  is equated and 
calculated iteratively with the  from the site
binding model. Bisection method is adopted to find 
pHpzc and  for a particular surface charge density 
following the belowmentioned relation.
