In this context, functionalized refers to
incorporating different chemical groups into the graphene struc
ture, forming distinct GO derivatives with tailored properties. Carbonbased materials, mainly GOmodified with metal oxides,
have also garnered significant research interest due to their
improved stability, durability, and enhanced electrocatalytic and
photocatalytic performance2831. These findings underscore
the importance of defect engineering and functionalization in
optimizing carbonbased materials to capture and activate small
molecules. Using computational modelling and experimental ad
vances, researchers can design nextgeneration materials capable
of addressing the challenges posed by climate change32,33. The
insights gained from these studies contribute to fundamental
scientific knowledge and pave the way for innovative solutions to
energy and environmental sustainability3436.
