Description:
A synthetic polymer used to make hydrogels.

For example, 
they can be engineered to mimic the mechanical properties of biological tissues, which 
makes them ideal candidates for use in the regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues.2 
 Hydrogels are a diverse class of materials that can be engineered to have a range of 
properties and functionalities, making them useful in a variety of biomedical and industrial 
applications.3 Here are some of the most common types of hydrogels 1) Natural 
hydrogels These hydrogels are made from naturally occurring polymers, such as hyaluronic 
acid, chitosan, or collagen. They are biocompatible and biodegradable, making them ideal 
for use in tissue engineering and wound healing applications.4 2) Synthetic hydrogels 
These hydrogels are made from synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or 
polyacrylamide (PAA).
