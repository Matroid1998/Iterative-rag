Description:
Electron-poor compounds that can form phosphonium salts.

of even more electron
poor phosphines was hampered by difficulties in the formation of the phosphonium salt or competing 
metalfluoride exchange (1d, 1e). 3

phosphoranylideneketene 3 formation. Table 1. Impact of the phosphine, the solvent and alkali metal on the selectivity of the carbonylation of tosyl
substituted metallated ylides. The complete list of screening experiments is given in the Supporting Information
