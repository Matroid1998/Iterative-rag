Text:
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are an historically important family of inorganic framework materials,
known for their gasstorage, catalytic, photophysical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties.15 In con
temporary language, PBAs are a kind of hybrid perovskite6 their structure is based on that of the cubic
ABX3 perovskite net, with cyanide molecules playing the role of the Xanionic component. One con
sequence of this molecular building block is that the perovskite cagei.e.
