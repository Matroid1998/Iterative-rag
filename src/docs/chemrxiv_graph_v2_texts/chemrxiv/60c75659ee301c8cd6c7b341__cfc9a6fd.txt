Description:
A complex with coordination spheres showing similar geometry and bond lengths in both high-spin and low-spin models.

Text:
The 
coordination spheres of the de novo HS and LS models of Co(1)2 each agree remarkably well, both in terms of geometry and bond 
lengths (RMSD  0.05 and 0.04  respectively, see Table S10), with one of the isomeric structures observed by SCXRD (Figure 1B for 
the HS structure), supporting this proposal. Furthermore, a relatively small energetic preference for the HS configuration was predicted 
computationally for both the de novo structures (5.9 kJmol) and models of Co(1)2 derived from the corresponding SCXRD geometries 
(2.7 kJmol, see ESI for details). Predicting accurate energy gaps of multiconfigurational complexes is a challenge for DFT modelling.
