Description:
A solvent that influences proton chemical shifts in NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
In macrocyclic systems with NH functional groups, each proton signal is shifted 
upfield upon changing the solvent from toluene to cyclohexane 5. In chloroform, shifts of 
about 1 ppm are seen upon changing the solvent from cyclohexane to benzene 6. A plethora 
of experimental and theoretical research has already been carried out on such solvent induced 
changes in NMR spectroscopy 711. These chemical shifts have been attributed to solute
solvent clustering or the formation of solvation spheres which gives rise to solvated solute sites 
or cavities where the electrical activity is rich and is called the reaction field 3,12. Hydrogen 
bonding, anisotropy in the solvent molecules, weak van der Waals interactions, unspecific 
shielding effects such as intrasolvent or solventsolute  weak interactions 13,14 also play 
a role.
