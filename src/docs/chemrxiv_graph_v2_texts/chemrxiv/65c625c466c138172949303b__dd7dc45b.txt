Description:
A scaffold that can switch between homolytic and heterolytic HER pathways by regulating steric effects via selective functionalisation.

Text:
In a follow up work, the same group reported a switch between homolytic and heterolytic HER 
pathways by regulating steric effects via selective functionalisation of the ortho and para 
positions in a Ni(II)porphyrin scaffold.17 
 In the recent past, several functional analogues of the bimetallic electrocatalysts have been 
shown to have beneficial influence on electrochemical HER compared to their mononuclear 
analogues. For example, a recent report by Apfel and coworkers demonstrated that a bimetallic 
macrocycle featuring two cofacially linked Ni(II)porphyrin via a linker molecule exhibited 
higher faradaic efficiency and 2fold increase in HER activity compared to its monomeric
