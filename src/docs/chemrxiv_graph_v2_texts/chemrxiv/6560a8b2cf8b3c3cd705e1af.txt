Description:
Undergoes oxidation to form stable dityrosine dimers.

Text:
The changes in voltammetric behaviour related to peak position 
and current decrease of the peaks corresponding to the oxidation of tyrosine, histidine and 
methionine allow for investigation of fibrilisation mechanisms not only of fulllength A, like 
A(140) and A(142) but also shorter fragments (like A(1020), A(1228)) or mutants (e.g. A(140) Y10F, where the tyrosine moiety is substituted by phenylalanine (Phe, F)).1015 Oxidation 
of tyrosine leads to the formation of stable dityrosine dimers of As, whose importance is widely 
discussed in the pathogenesis of AD.1619 According to Enache and OliveiraBrett, in the initial 
step of oxidation, Tyr undergoes a oneelectron and oneproton transfer to form the tyrosine 
phenoxyl radical (Tyr).2026 This is a pHdependent process, occurring at a potential  0.65 V vs. 
AgAgCl at pH 7.4.
