Possible pathways of rearrangement between isomeric nitrile oxides (RCNO), cyanates (ROCN), and
isocyanates (RNCO) have captivated the attention of chemists for over a century.16 Since the development
of computational chemistry, numerous studies have aimed to explain the nitrileoxidetoisocyanate isomerization;
