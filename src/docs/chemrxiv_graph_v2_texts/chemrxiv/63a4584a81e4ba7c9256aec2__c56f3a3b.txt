Description:
Can be converted to CO by the water-gas shift reaction.

Text:
Many renewable sources of CO gas are also 
available biomass, wood waste, and recycled plastics.37 Further, CO can be produced from 
CO2 directly by the watergas shift reaction (Eq. 1).8 Key industrial processes use CO as a 
building block. For example, the Cativa process produces acetic acid by the iridium catalysed 
carbonylation of methanol at the 500,000ton scale annually.9,10 Similarly, the 
hydroformylation oxo process produces aldehydes from alkenes through the net addition of 
a formyl (CHO) unit to saturated carboncarbon bonds.11 The FischerTropsch (FT) process 
provides liquid hydrocarbons from syngas, mixtures of CO and H2, and can be considered as 
the controlled hydrogenation and homologation of CO. The FT process consumes tens of 
thousands of barrels of crude oil daily to produce petroleum fuel.
