Description:
Used as a medium for suspending dextrotartaric acid crystals in fluid flow experiments.

Shear vorticity is the rotation of an object induced by
a velocity gradient in a uid undergoing shear ow.8,9 The potential separation of enantiomers
by achiral uid ow was reported by Howard et al.10,11 Inside a rotating drum, Howard and co
workers suspended dextrotartaric acid crystals in Isopar H (isoparafnic hydrocarbons), and ob
served pure macroscopic enantiomers moving in specic directions depending on the Isopar H
ow.10
Howard et al.s idea10,11 has been extended to separating biological and manufactured chiral
