Description:
A functional group that can react with thioesters to generate phospholipids.

Text:
Interestingly, it was also observed that the remaining thiol group of the diacylated product can 
further react with additional thioesters to generate phospholipids containing three alkyl chains. Inspired by these findings, 
we hypothesized that cysteine itself may undergo NCL in the presence of acyl thioesters followed by substrate reloading, 
leading to the production of diacylcysteine species. Both cysteine and shortchain thioesters have been shown to be 
synthesized by prebiotically plausible routes, and both can be produced in abundance, the latter through derivatization 
of shortchain fatty acids (24, 25 . Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the significance of cysteine in prebiotic 
metabolism, for instance as a catalyst for peptide bond formation (24 .
