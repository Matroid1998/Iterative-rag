A polymer used in combination with fillers like carbon nanotubes for nanocomposite processing.

Ordered polymer nanocomposites provide a route to highperformance lightweight 
structural materials with applications including aircraft and spacecraft structures, sporting 
equipment, and filtration membranes.1 Research and development on nanocomposite processing 
has been devoted to the combination of fillers such as highcrystallinity natural2,3 or synthetic4,5 
polymer fibers or carbon nanotubes (CNTs)6,7 with polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol)3,8,9 or 
commercial resin systems.10 The molecular organization and potential ordering of the polymer at 
the surface of the nanofillers has also been a particular center of attention as a mean to affect 
overall composite performance.6 
Due to their outstanding mechanical and electrical properties and low mass density, the 
composites of CNTs with engineered polymers offer great potential as nextgeneration lightweight 
structural materials.11 CNTpolymer composites have most commonly been made by resin 
infiltration of CNT mats or fibers, thereby translating manufacturing techniques widely used for 
carbonfiber composites.6 Nevertheless, as the size of the reinforcement fibers reduces to the 
nanoscale, the complex interplay among transportlimited polymer infiltration, curing kinetics, and 
CNTpolymer molecular interaction greatly impacts the local polymer content and properties, and
