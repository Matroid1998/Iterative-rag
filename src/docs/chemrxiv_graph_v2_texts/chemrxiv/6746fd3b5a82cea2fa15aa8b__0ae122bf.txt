Description:
A catalyst that influences the formation of cyclic compounds in reactions with aldehydes and DACs.

Text:
DACs are often regarded as synthons for 1,3
zwitterionic intermediates, which undergo cycloaddition and 
annulation reactions (Schemes 1, (2) and (3)). Indeed, the capacity 
of DACs to engage in cycloadditions provides access to a diverse 
range of carbocyclic and heterocyclic structures. 1,9,14,16,17,21
25. The rearrangement of DACs leads to the formation of 
unsaturated fivemembered heterocycles, thus providing a metal
free approach to connected heterocyclic structures (Schemes 1, (2) 
and (3)). This paper focuses on the 32cycloaddition reaction of 
DACs with aldehydes, which provides a wide range of cyclic 
compounds depending on the Lewis acid used.
