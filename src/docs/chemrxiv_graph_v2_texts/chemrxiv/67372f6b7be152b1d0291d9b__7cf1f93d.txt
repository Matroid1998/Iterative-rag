Description:
Refers to linkages (Câ‰¡C) introduced between the C-C bonds of graphene to derive graphynes.

Carbonbased materials such as graphene and graphynes (GYs) have garnered considerable 
interest as potential candidates for gas separation, energy storage materials, isotope separation, 
catalysis, water purification, and optoelectronic devices, owing to their distinctive structural 
and electronic properties.16 Numerous studies have shown that GYs, in particular, hold 
promise as electrode materials in lithiumion batteries.6, 7 GYs are carbon allotropes akin to 
graphene, first proposed by Baughman and coworkers in 1987.8 They can be theoretically 
derived from graphene by introducing acetylenic linkages (CC) between the CC bonds of 
graphene. GYs can be classified into various forms based on the arrangement and number of 
their acetylenic linkages. These include types like , , , and rhombicGY, as well as 
subclasses such as GY1, GY2, etc.
