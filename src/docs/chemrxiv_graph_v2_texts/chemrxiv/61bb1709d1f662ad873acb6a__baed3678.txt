Description:
Compounds studied for their interaction with metallocene complexes of zirconium.

Text:
The nature of 
the interaction of metallocene complexes of zirconium and 
organoaluminum compounds has been studied in detail and 
continues to be studied by L.V. Parfenova with coworkers 4,5. However, there are no literature data on the study of the exchange 
reactions of zirconocene complexes with organocin reagents. Currently 
known 
examples 
of 
Cp2ZrCl2catalyzed 
2
zincoethylzincation of 5decyne 6 and substituted 2alkynylamines 
7, as well as ethylzincation of terminal olefins 8 serve as a 
reliable prerequisite for the alkylation of metallocene dichlorides 
using diethylzinc. The results of study of the alkylation of such 
organozirconium 
complexes 
as 
bis(cyclopentadienyl)hafnium 
dimethyl (Cp2HfMe2, 1Me2) and N(2,6diisopropylphenyl)(2
isopropylphenyl)6(1naphthalenyl)2
pyridinemethanaminatohafnium dimethyl (2Me2) with Et2Zn are 
preseted in for the first time in 9.
