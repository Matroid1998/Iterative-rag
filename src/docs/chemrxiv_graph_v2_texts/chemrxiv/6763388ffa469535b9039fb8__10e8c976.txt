Description:
Used as glass substrates for working electrodes.

A potent strategy for detecting such small absorption changes 
is the application of a periodically modulating potential and 
tuning a lockin amplifier onto the frequency of the modulation. With such potentialmodulated absorption spectroscopy 
(EMAS), even weak signals can be distinguished from a 
prominent background. In this work, we apply HIn2O3 (IHO) silica glass substrates as 
working electrodes (WE) for reductive and oxidative EMAS 
measurements of four different PbS QD samples with excitonic 
transitions between 1474 nm and 1729 nm. We demonstrate 
successful hole and electron injection and find evidence for 
shallow ingap density of states. Results 
Optical and (spectro)electrochemical properties of the IHO 
electrodes 
In Figure 1a, we compare the optical transmittance of IHOfilms 
on glass used here as working electrodes to commercially 
available FTO substrates.
