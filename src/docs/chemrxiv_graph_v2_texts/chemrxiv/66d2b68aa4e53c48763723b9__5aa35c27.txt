Description:
A promising solid-state electrolyte for next-generation Li-ion batteries due to its high Li ionic conductivity, nonflammability, and high electrochemical stability.

Conventional Liion battery technology based on liquid electrolytes is reaching its limits with
respect to energy density without compromising safety. Batteries with higher energy densi
ties are required to accelerate reduction of CO2 emissions. Solidstate ceramic electrolytes
are inherently safer than volatile and flammable liquid electrolytes and can potentially en
able batteries with higher energy density. The garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) is a promising
solidstate electrolyte for nextgeneration Liion batteries due to its high Li ionic conductiv
ity, nonflammability and high electrochemical stability against Li anodes and high voltage
cathodes1,2. LLZO is typically synthesized via solidstate reaction or solgel synthesis routes316.
