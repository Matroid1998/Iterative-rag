Description:
Reactive monomers that polymerize, contributing to the main fouling mechanism in the model.

Text:
In our prior research, we took the initial step of creating a predictive multiphase detailed
chemical kinetic model for polymer fouling in an industrial distillation column that separates
C4 and lighter species from heavier ones (debutanizer),6 as illustrated in Fig. 1. That
model only considered the base case scenario, which includes alkanes, alkenes, conjugated
dienes, and aromatics from steam cracker effluents, and excluded any impurities or industrial
additives. The model showed that under the base case scenario, the main fouling mechanism
is the polymerization of reactive monomers, e.g., dienes.
