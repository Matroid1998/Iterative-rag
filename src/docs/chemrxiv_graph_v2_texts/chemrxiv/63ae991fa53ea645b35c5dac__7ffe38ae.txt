Description:
A chromophore in the FusionRed protein with relevant dihedral angles I and P highlighted.

The mecha
nism of isomerization relies on the rotation about the two
bonds which bridge the rings of the chromophore, desig
nated I and P (see Figure 1). If only one bond rotates,
it is onebondfliplike, while if both bonds rotate in oppos
ing directions, such that the two rings remain in approxi
mately the same plane, the mechanism is hulatwistlike 8. Photoswitching proteins can provide a means of highly se
lective, direct tracking of cellular processes, such as tracking
the position of proteins within living cells 9,10. FusionRed
has previously shown potential for producing efficient pho
toswitches 6, which has been purported to arise from the
Figure 1. MetTyrGly chromophore in FusionRed protein. Rele
vant dihedral angles I (blue) and P (red) are highlighted on the
chromophore.
