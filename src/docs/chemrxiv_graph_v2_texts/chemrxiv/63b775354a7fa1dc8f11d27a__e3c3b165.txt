Description:
A biorenewable monomer used in the synthesis of block copolymers.

Another 
study on the photoinitiated cationic polymerization of LO also 
reported homopolymers with molar masses lower than 1.7 kDa 
and high dispersity.20 Recently, metalcatalyzed ring opening 
polymerization was used for PLO synthesis, giving a molar mass 
of 1.3 kDa but good control over dispersity.21 

The limited number of reports available and the low molar 
mass of the PLO suggest that the homopolymerization of LO is 
difficult, also indicating that the preparation of LO based block 
copolymers other than alternating copolymers might not be 
straightforward. In order to determine if LO based block 
copolymers 
have 
value 
and 
potential 
applications,22 
preparation methods are needed. We decided to use redox switchable copolymerization for 
the synthesis of LO block copolymers with Llactide (LA, Figure 
1c), another biorenewable monomer.
