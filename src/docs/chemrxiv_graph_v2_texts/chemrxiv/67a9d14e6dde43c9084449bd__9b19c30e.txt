Description:
Involved in nonclassical crystallization pathways with solubility and dynamic nature.

Text:
However, in the past decade, this theory has been challenged by the emergence of the so
called nonclassical crystallization pathway (NCP) due to the observation of stable solute transient 
species that form in solution before nucleation.2 In the context of biomineralization, such PNS have 
been reported for calcium phosphates,3,4 carbonates5,6 and oxalates.7,8 The characterization of these 
PNS is particularly challenging due to their solubility, nanometric size, dynamic nature, and short 
lifespan.

Description:
Monitored for formation and evolution in fast mineralizing solutions using dissolution DNP.

Text:
Indeed, dissolution DNP (dDNP) allows the acquisition of NMR spectra on a very short time scale 
(0.5 s1) and has been successfully used to monitor the formation and the evolution of PNS for calcium 
phosphates19,20 and carbonates21,22 in fast mineralizing solutions. The rates of formation, aggregation 
and kinetic exchange with free ions involving PNS can be determined using this approach.19 However, 
limitations exist as dDNP equipment is rare, and 2D experiments cannot be recorded with dDNP (unless 
by combining with singlescan methodologies). Thus, ideally, it would be beneficial to stop the reaction and characterize the system at 
specific time points as long as needed to record 1D and 2D NMR spectra.
