Description:
A peroxide monomer with stable peroxide groups during storage and good reactivity during polymerization.

As an alternative, polymer containing peroxide moieties in 
their side chains are known. For this, a plethora of different peroxide containing monomers with 
different structure can be used for (co)polymerization. It has been suggested that 5tertbutylperoxy
5methyl1hexen3yne (PM) is a particularly interesting peroxide monomer due to its rather stable 
peroxide groups during storage and good reactivity during the polymerization 24. In fact, the 
synthesis of copolymers containing PM along with other reactive groups has been reported 
previously 24. These copolymers act as radical generators and have potential as compatibilization 
agents and surface modifiers. Therefore, such polymers have been studied for different applications, 
e.g. to interact with the interface of polymer colloidal systems, as coupling agents in polymer 
composites or as amphiphiles in aqueous solutions.
