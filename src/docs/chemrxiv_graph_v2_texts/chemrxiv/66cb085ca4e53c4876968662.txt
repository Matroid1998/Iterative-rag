Description:
A vibrational mode useful as a VSE sensor for assessing electric field strengths.

Text:
1a is often written in linear form 
()  0  

(1b) 
because  is typically experimentally negligible.14 Several 
vibrational 
modes, 
such 
as 
the 
carbonyl 
(CO) 
stretch,14,27,29,3133 have become very useful VSE sensors 
because they behave according to eq. 1b.14,34 As such, they 
have enabled the assessment of electric field strengths for 
HBs and other noncovalent interactions in the condensed 
phase.15,16,32,35,36
