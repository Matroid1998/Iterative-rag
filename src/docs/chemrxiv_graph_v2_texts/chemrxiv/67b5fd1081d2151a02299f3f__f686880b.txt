Description:
Forms oxygen-centered alcoholate radicals that act as electrophilic open-shell species.

The selective functionalisation of short 
alkanes such as methane, available in natural gases, is a 
topic of current interest.14 Processes have been developed 
to convert gaseous hydrocarbons into highly valuable 
chemicals that serve as platform substrates for further ap
plications.2 However, due to their nonpolar and volatile 
nature, the specific activation of CH bonds remains a chal
lenging task. To address this challenge, hydrogen atom 
transfer (HAT) processes have emerged as a powerful 
tool.35 Small molecules such as chlorine radicals or oxy
gencentred alcoholate radicals act as electrophilic open
shell species with a high propensity for abstraction of hy
drogen atoms from electronrich CH bonds within the 
range of their bonddissociation energy.610 The resulting 
carboncentred radicals undergo subsequent transfor
mations and functionalisation reactions.
