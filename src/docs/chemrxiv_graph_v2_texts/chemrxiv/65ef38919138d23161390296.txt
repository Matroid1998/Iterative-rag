Description:
Forms aromatic frameworks in nanomaterials like fullerenes and graphene.

Text:
Carbonbased nanomaterials, including fullerenes, nanotubes, and graphene, are widely utilized
in various fields for their unique properties that arise from their aromatic carbon frameworks.15
Among them, fullerenes are polyhedral cage molecules with the general molecular formula C202n (n 
0, n  1) composed of sp2 hybridized carbons arranged in pentagon and hexagon rings. The varia
tion in the arrangement of these rings across the fullerene cages leads to numerous isomeric structures
