Used as an anode in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Text:
LithiumSulfur (LiS) batteries, with sulfur as cathode and Li metal as an anode, with a theoretical capacity 
of 1667 mAhg, will satisfy the demand from the aviation industry and accelerate the commercialization of battery
based aircraft 5. Besides its energy density, rate performance for batterybased aircraft also plays an important role 
as good rate performance of LiS batteries will accelerate its wide adoption within batterybased aircraft. However, 
the community recognizes that operating temperature plays an important role for LIBs and LiS batteries 6. Moreover, 
Previous studies revealed significant heating effects of LIBs under higher charging rates and higher operating 
temperatures would deteriorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interphase formed on the anode and shorten the 
cycle life.

A metal used as an anode in LiS batteries.

Text:
As SEI formed on Li metal anode also plays an important role within LiS batteries, it is necessary to probe 
the heating effects of enhanced charging rates on LiS batteries. Besides, high operating temperature for LIBs and Li
S batteries will cause safety concerns thermal runaway for LIBs and possible burnup for LiS batteries. Plenty of simulation studies have been widely implemented by researchers for LIBs ranging from the 
cylindrical cell and pouch cells to the battery pack. Chunrong Zhao et al. probed the heat generation and cooling under
