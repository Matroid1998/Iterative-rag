Acknowledging the management 
difficulties associated with FW and the necessity to diminish reliance on current disposal methods, 
a shift towards a circular economy approach is advocated. This perspective views FW as a valuable 
and sustainable resource. By considering FW as a viable carbon source, this approach aims to 
address waste management challenges while also reducing the use of fossilcarbon resources, 
thereby enhancing environmental performance within the fish industry 8, 9. Considering the 
valuable protein, essential amino acids, lipids, and essential fatty acids present in fish waste (FW),
