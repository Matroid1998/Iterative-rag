Description:
An anion used in ionic liquids for LIB electrolytes, known for better thermal stability and higher ionic conductivity.

For these reasons, therefore, there has been considerable research interest to replace the 
PF6 anions with novel anions, that have better thermal stability and enhanced cycling 
performance. 35. Ionic liquids (ILs) based on bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide TFSI 
46 and fluorosulfonyl(pentafluoroethanesulfonyl)imide FSI 79 are leading candidate 
anions for LIB electrolytes as they generally exhibit better thermal stability, relatively low 
viscosity and higher ionic conductivity 10. The TFSI anion has been designated as a 
benchmark anion in ILs by IUPAC. As a result, the TFSI anion has been the focus of 
several experimental 1113 and theoretical studies 1417. There are several benefits of 
using the TFSI anion containing ILs for LIB electrolytes.
