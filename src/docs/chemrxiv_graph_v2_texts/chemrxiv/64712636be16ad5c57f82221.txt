Description:
An oxidant used in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, reduced to water or hydrogen peroxide.

Text:
Given its abundance, atmospheric molecular oxygen is an attractive 
oxidant for the generation of electricity from chemical fuels (such as H2 or methanol in fuel 
cells14 or metals like Zn, Fe, or Al in metalair batteries58) or for the distributed onsite 
electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide.9,10 In aqueous systems at room temperature, 
these separate applications require different selectivity in the terminal product of oxygen 
reduction, where generating hydrogen peroxide terminates at a net 2electron2proton 
reduction (hydrogen peroxide production reaction, HPPR O2  2H  2e  H2O2, E0  0.695 V 
vs. SHE) and fuel cell or metalair battery applications ideally reduce oxygen to water through a 
net 4electron4proton process (oxygen reduction reaction, ORR O2  4H  4e  2H2O, E0  
1.23 V vs. SHE).

Description:
A molecule that can be reduced with the help of an electrocatalyst.

Text:
Although not universal, it is generally assumed that an electrocatalyst is needed to reduce 
oxygen.

Description:
Involved in reduction reactions studied with OMIECs, showing selectivity for different electron transfer pathways.

Text:
Recently, organic mixed ionicelectronic conducting polymers (OMIECs) have been 
reported to exhibit catalytic behavior for electrochemical reactions.1115 OMIECs are 
semiconducting conjugated polymers with synthetically tunable structures and transport 
properties enabled by electrochemical ioninsertion redox reactions.16 These electrochemical 
doping reactions drive the insertion of mobile ions and electrons (or holes), providing 
functionality for a range of electrochemical devices.1621 For electrocatalysis, holeanion 
transporting OMIECs (ptype), including PEDOT (poly(3,4ethylenedioxythiophene)) variations, 
have been studied for oxygen reduction and display selectivity for the 2electron reaction.13,14,22 
BBL (poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)), an electroncation transporting (ntype) OMIEC, 
has also been shown to be active for the ORR, with pHdependent selectivity for the 4electron 
versus the 2electron product.15 These studies highlight the potential of OMIECs as electrodes 
for oxygen reduction, but the fundamental design principles that control their activities and 
selectivity are still being developed.
