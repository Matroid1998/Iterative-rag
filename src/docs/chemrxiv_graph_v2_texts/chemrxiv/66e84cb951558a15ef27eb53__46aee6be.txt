Description:
Used as a precatalyst in transition metal-catalyzed carbon-heteroatom bond formation.

Text:
Transition metalcatalyzed carbonheteroatom bond formation is fundamental to modern synthetic organic chemistry, playing 
a pivotal role in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials.16 These transformations are typically 
performed using palladium (Pd),1,713 copper (Cu),1419 or nickel (Ni) precatalysts,5,2031 with their efficiency reliant on the 
precise balance of ligands, solvents, and bases for the key catalytic steps to effectively occur. Despite substantial progress, 
achieving the optimal synergy between ligands and bases remains especially challenging, often requiring casebycase 
optimization. While effective ligand design is essential for optimizing oxidative addition, reductive elimination, and active 
catalyst formation and stability, base selection influences nucleophile binding, deprotonation, and overall catalyst performance. Traditional methods often rely on inorganic bases or strong anionic bases with low nucleophilicity.

Description:
Binds to anilines and is involved in cross-coupling reactions with aryl triflates.

Text:
Milder and more costeffective alkyl amines present a promising alternative but often lack sufficient basicity for effective 
deprotonation.44 To tackle this, Buchwald and coworkers elegantly designed an electrondeficient ligand that allows the 
deprotonation of nickelbound anilines with triethylamine for crosscoupling with aryl triflates.45 Notably, using the more 
nucleophilic base, DBU, inhibits the reaction due to its preferential coordination to nickel, demonstrating the additional layer 
of complexity in achieving the optimal balance between ligands and bases when working with weakly nucleophilic coupling 
partners.
