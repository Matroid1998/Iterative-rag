Description:
A phosphine-modified cobalt complex with a more hydridic Co-H bond.

Text:
4,57 Following the discovery of Roelens 
cobalt hydroformylation catalyst, HCo(CO)4,5 attempts 
to improve the performance of the cobalt complexes by 
addition phosphines (PR3Co(CO)3H; R  alkyl, aryl) 
modified the product distribution to include C1
homologated alcohols arising from a more hydridic Co
H bond.6 Poor regioselectivity and forcing conditions 
(25 atm COH2, 180 C) motivated the transition to 
rhodium and ruthenium catalysts that exhibited 
improved selectivity for alcohol formation from 
minimallyfunctional alkenes.7 While cobalt catalysis 
has been used commercially for the synthesis 
homologated alcohols from C8C15 streams,1 rhodium 
has also been used emphasizing the value of 
regioselectivity in the seminal reaction. Scheme
