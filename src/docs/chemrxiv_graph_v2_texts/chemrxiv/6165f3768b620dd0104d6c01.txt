Description:
Substitution in WB4-based solid solutions improves hardness.

Text:
For instance, substitution of W with Ti, Zr, Hf, Mo, Ta, Mn,
or Cr improves hardness of WB4based solid solutions from HV  43 GPa to greater than
HV  50 GPa.1315 Similarly, Mo0.9W1.1BC demonstrates improved hardness compared to
2
