Description:
A group 13 element routinely employed as a Lewis acid in catalysis.

Text:
Compounds of the group 13 elements boron, aluminium and gallium are routinely employed as 
Lewis acids in catalysis. The high fluorideion affinities of threecoordinate group 13 compounds1 
underpin numerous applications that break and functionalise strong carbonfluorine bonds. For 
example, BF3OEt2 and AlCl3 have been reported as catalysts for the FriedelCrafts alkylation of 
arenes with fluoroalkanes.2 B(C6F5)3 has been shown to catalyse the hydrodefluorination of 
fluoroalkanes using Et3SiH as a terminal reductant.3 Similar reactivity has been achieved using 
aluminium chloride fluoride (ACF), a heterogenous catalyst proposed to contain highly Lewis acid 
active sites based on aluminium.48 Aluminium compounds are also competent reagents9,10 and 
catalysts11,12 for carbonheteroatom and carboncarbon from fluoroalkanes.
