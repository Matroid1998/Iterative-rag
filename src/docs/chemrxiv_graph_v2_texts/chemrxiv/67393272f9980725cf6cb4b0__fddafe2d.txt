Description:
Can be upcycled from nitrogen-rich waste streams into valued products like ammonium fertilizer salts.

Ammonia remains one of the most impactful chemical
commodities to the global committee, with 70 of ammo
nia we generate going toward Ncontaining fertilizer produc
tion to keep up with food production demands.1 Currently,
ammonia is produced by the HaberBosch process, which re
quires 39GJ of energy per ton of fixed nitrogen produced, and
accounts for 11 of energy used annually in the chemical
industry.1 Furthermore, the HaberBosch process requires
large volumes of H2 produced by steam methane reforming
or coal gasification, both of which produce CO2 as a byprod
uct.2 As a result, ammonia production accounted for 2 of
the total global energy consumed and 1.3 of global CO2
emissions in 2020a significant portion of global emis
sions.1 Given the high energy demands and environmental
impact associated with producing ammonia, enabling the
upcycle and conversion of NH3 present in waste streams
such as nitrogenrich pig slurries from the livestock industry
into valued products provides a path towards increasing the
sustainability of fertilizer production.3 Anaerobic digestion
combined with ammonia stripping presents a costeffective
and environmentally friendly means to upcycle NH3 from
nitrogenrich waste, providing the opportunity to convert
captured ammonia into ammonium fertilizer salts.3 In On
tario, research on anaerobic digestion has indicated that the
process could be used in some instances to replace coal as an
electricity source in order to combat CO2 emissions.4 While
previous works have explored using acidbase reactions to
produce different types of ammonium salts, with NH4NO3
being the most favoured target, the gross profit of generating
NH4NO3 from reclaimed ammonia is economically undesir
able.5
