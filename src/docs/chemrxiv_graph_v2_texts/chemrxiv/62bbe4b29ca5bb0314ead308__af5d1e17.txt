Description:
A drug that eventually proved ineffective against COVID-19.

Text:
12 Other antivirals already marketed such as favipiravir13 and 
EIDD280114 show mixed evidence, while drugs such as lopinavir, ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine eventually proved 
ineffective. 15 Currently, the clinical treatment of COVID19 is mainly symptomatic, using antiinflammatories such as 
dexamethasone16 or cytosine inhibitors, combined with antibiotics to treat secondary infections. There is therefore an urgent need to 
develop specific antiviral therapies against SARSCoV2. SARSCoV2 has a sequence identity of 79.6 with SARSCoV1 and 96.2 with bat coronavirus. 3 From this high similarity in 
nucleotide sequences it was inferred that, like SARSCoV1, SARSCoV2 uses a highly glycosylated protein found in its envelope, 
called Sprotein, to bind to the cell through interaction with the angiotensinconverting enzyme, ACE2 3, 17.
