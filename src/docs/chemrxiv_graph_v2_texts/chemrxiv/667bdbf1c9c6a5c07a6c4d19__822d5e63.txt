Description:
Precursors widely available in the market, used in sol-gel synthesis for mesoporous silica-based hybrids.

Text:
In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, class II hybrids are preferable to class I ones because 
strong bonds between organic and inorganic building blocks in the former would favor 
preservation of the hybrid catalysts during catalytic reaction, minimizing leaching of the active 
organic moiety into reaction media.2 Mesoporous silicabased hybrids derived from the solgel 
synthesis method are particularly attractive as potential hybrid heterogeneous catalysts due to 
the wide availability of organosilicon precursors in the market, the ease of preparation and 
tuning as well as the high accessibility of active sites and the efficient mass transport.2 So far, 
these hybrids have been synthesized mainly by using the traditional solgel method, aka the 
hydrolytic solgel (HSG), whose mechanism is related to hydrolysis and polycondensation 
reactions.
