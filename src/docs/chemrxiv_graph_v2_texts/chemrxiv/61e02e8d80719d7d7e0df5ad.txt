Description:
Involved in the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells.

Electrification of the transport sector and the transition towards renewable energy 
solutions is crucial in the race towards cutting the greenhouse gas emissions. While battery 
electric vehicles are already leading the way, an important part of the electrification puzzle will 
be fuel cell electric vehicles 1. One of the main barriers preventing mass adoption of proton 
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology remains the highcost of the electrocatalyst 
material 2. Due to the inherently sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a large amount of 
platinum (Pt) is required, which would represent over 50 of the total membrane electrode 
assembly (MEA) manufacturing costs 3 making it also the highest cost contributor to the entire 
stack 4.
