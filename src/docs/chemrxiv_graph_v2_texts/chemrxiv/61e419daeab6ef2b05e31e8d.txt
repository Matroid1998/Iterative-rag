Description:
A material whose lattice distortion strategy enhances the internal electric field (IEF) in bulk systems.

Therefore, its highly desired to find a 
suitable strategy that can increase the dipole moments and, hence, strengthen the IEF 
over the long range throughout whole bulk, in order to improve the efficiency of the CST 
process and the related photocatalytic performance in polymeric photocatalysts.10 
Inspired by the lattice distortion strategy, which was shown to be highly effective in 
enhancing IEF in the bulk TiO2 and BiPO4 system,11 the present study applied a similar 
lattice symmetrybreaking strategy on the typical crystalline conjugated polymers, poly
(phenyleneimine) (PPI). These faciletoprepare PPIs from the intermediates of fine 
chemicals (phenylenediamine and phthalaldehyde) possess identical functional groups, 
weak DA moieties, and quite different lattice symmetries.
