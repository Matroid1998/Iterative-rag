Description:
An important chiral building block used in the synthesis of various compounds.

Text:
The epoxide, (R)1,2epoxyhex5ene (1) is an important chiral building block. It has been 
used in a number of asymmetric synthetic methodologies, including the syntheses of chiral 
isothiazolidine1,1dioxides,1 
benzoxathiazepine1,1dioxides,2 
butanolides,3 
hydroxy 
morpholine amides,4 and varied alcohols. Several natural product syntheses have also utilized 
compound 1, such as in the syntheses of ()gigantecin and ()14deoxy9oxygigantecin,5 
pyragonicin,6 amphidinolides C and F,7,8 and Sch725674 macrolactones.9 Biologically active 
compounds and pharmaceutical substances have also been prepared as single enantiomers from 
this chiral epoxide.
