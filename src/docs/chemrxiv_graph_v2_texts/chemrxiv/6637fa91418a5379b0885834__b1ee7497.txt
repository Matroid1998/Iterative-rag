Description:
Larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons applicable to oxidative bond cleavage.

Text:
of electronwithdrawing carbonyl 
groups does not retard the reactions, and 2e was obtained in 86 yield over two steps. Various brominated DBC derivatives also engaged in this transformation and furnished 
the corresponding CBBCs 2f2i in 6386 yield over two steps. These brominated 
CBBC derivatives are valuable precursors for the construction of elaborate frameworks. To our delight, the innerbondcleavage strategy is also applicable to the larger PAHs 4 
and 5. The oxidative bond cleavage of 4 and 5 proceeded selectively at two internal CC 
bonds to furnish 6 and 7 in 63 and 59 yield, respectively. The selectivity of the 
reactions can be explained by Clars rule (35), which predicts higher doublebond 
character for the oxidatively cleaved inner CC bonds of 4 and 5.
