Description:
Has a Pauling electronegativity of 3.44.

Text:
The quartz topology is also observed in binary (ZnTe) and ternary (GaAsO4, FePO4) compounds. In 
particular, under pressure, in addition to the cubic sphalerite structure (space group F43m) 
characteristic of zinc chalcogenides, ZnTe also exhibits a trigonal HgStype structure (space group 
P3121) 10 with qtz topology. This may be because the Pauling electronegativity ()of the chalcogen 
decreases from oxygen ((O)  3.44) to tellurium ((Te)  2.10). Knowing (Zn)  1.65, ZnO is an 
ionic compound (ZnO1.79), while ZnTe is already a covalent compound (ZnTe  0.45).
