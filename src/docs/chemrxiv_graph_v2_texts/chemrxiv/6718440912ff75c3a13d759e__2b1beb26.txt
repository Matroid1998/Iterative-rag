Disentangling parallel capacity loss mechanisms at solidsolid interfaces in solidstate batteries
(SSBs) remains a key bottleneck to adoption of this highdensity energy storage technology.1 Lay
ered oxide positive electrodes such as LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC) and LiNixCoyAlzO2 pair well with
mechanically soft solid electrolytes (SEs) to facilitate conformal contact upon compaction.2 Sulfur
containing SEs, such as Li3PS4, Li10GeP2S12, and Li6PS5Cl (LPSC), are mechanically compliant
and chemically abundant; however, sulfide SEs suffer from oxidative instability with layered oxides
at the positive electrode interface.3 This reactivity, in combination with constriction of ionic and
electronic pathways at solidsolid interfaces, leads to high overpotential,4 parasitic capacity loss,5
and particle disconnection.2 Decoupling parallel loss mechanisms enables deterministic evaluation
of material modifications, as has been shown in the Si negative electrode of SSBs .6 This work aims
to study the positive electrode and systematically quantify the relative capacity loss contributions
of apparent (kinetically hindered) irreversibility, such as sluggish SE and NMC redox, and true
(permanent) irreversibility, such as particle disconnection or pathdependent interfacial reactions.
