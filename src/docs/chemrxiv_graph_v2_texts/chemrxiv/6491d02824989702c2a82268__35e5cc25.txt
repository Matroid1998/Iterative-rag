Text:
As the thiol reactivity is related to the availability of the nucleophilic
thiolate,16,17 accurate pK a prediction tools such as the GPUaccelerated continuous con
stant pH molecular dynamics simulations18 can be used to assess cysteine reactivities
in drug targets.19,20 In principle, the intrinsic reactivity of a Michael acceptor can be pre
