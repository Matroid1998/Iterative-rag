Description:
Deprotected using the TMSClNaI association in CH3CN.

Under similar reaction 
conditions, we next demonstrated that a variety of 
dithioacetals were cleanly desulfurized at room 
temperature17 in CH2Cl2 using this metalfree 
process in a Mozingotype reaction.18 
By replacing CH2Cl2 by CH3CN as the reaction 
solvent, we surprisingly observed that dithianes 
derivatives were not reduced into methylene 
substrates but were totally and cleanly deprotected 
into ketones. It seemed interesting to study in detail 
this method for the deprotection of thioacetals which 
does not use metal salts, nor oxidants, nor toxic or 
expensive reagents (Figure 1). Herein, we wish to 
report the mild deprotection conditions of a range of 
dithianes, dithiolanes and oxygenated derivatives 
using the TMSClNaI association in CH3CN.
