Description:
Can be hydrogenated to methanol via thermal processes.

For instance, transitionmetal
catalysts can enable the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol
via thermal processes.1620 Currently, CuZnOAl2O3 is the
stateoftheart catalyst for performing this reaction.21 How
ever, this catalyst experiences deactivation in the presence of
high concentrations of water within the reaction mixture.2022
Hence, developing new, watertolerant catalysts is crucial to
achieve industrial CO2 utilization. Pdbased CO2 hydrogenation catalysts are more water
tolerant than those based on Cu.

Description:
A reactant in hydrogenation catalysts that can be improved by alloy materials.

Nevertheless, these systems
favor the reverse watergas shift reaction and produce signif
icant amounts of carbon monoxide.17,18 It has been shown
that the selectivity to the desired methanol product can be in
creased by alloying Pd with a second metal, such as Zn or
Ga.20,23 Therefore, alloy materials offer a promising strategy
for improving the performance of CO2 hydrogenation cata
lysts. Singleatom catalysts are a frontline approach in catalysis
research.24,25 In these materials, isolated atoms of a metal
are dispersed and stabilized on a host material. If the sub
strates are metals, we identify these materials as singleatom
alloys (SAAs).
