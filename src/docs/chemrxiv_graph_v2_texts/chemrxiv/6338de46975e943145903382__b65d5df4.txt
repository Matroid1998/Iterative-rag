Description:
A composite system with enhanced electrochemical performance and improved mechanical properties of brittle electrolytes.

For example, Na
alumina  yttriastabilized zirconia (YSZ) 14, Naalumina  samariadoped ceria (SDC) 15, 
sodium zirconogallateYSZ 16,17 and others 18 are notable examples of composite materials 
having uncoupled cation and anion transport (e.g., Na! and O) occurring through two separate 
but contiguous phases. These composites could be utilized for other functions such as providing 
selective chemical species transport to inject or remove specific species from a gas stream or 
chemical reaction. Moreover, one could envision numerous composite systems with features such 
as an increased number of mobile species for enhanced electrochemical performance and 
ameliorated mechanical properties of brittle electrolytes, such as strengthening observed in Na 
B Alumina  YSZ 19.
