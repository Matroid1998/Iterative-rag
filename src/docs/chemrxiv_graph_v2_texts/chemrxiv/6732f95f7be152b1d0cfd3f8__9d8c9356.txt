Description:
A cost-effective and efficient catalytic system capable of producing H2O2 in the presence of visible light.

Text:
Very recently, resorcinolformaldehyde (RF)based 
functional resins have been reported as cost 
effective and efficient catalytic system with the 
capability of H2O2 production in the presence of 
visible light.2933 In their remarkable pioneering 
work, Shiraishi et al. reported 296 molhg 
production of H2O2 through photoirradiation of 
water in the presence of oxygen using RF(COOH)2 
resins30 as catalyst and solar simulator as light 
source.30 Following the doping of P3HT, the 
catalytic activity of resorcinolformaldehyde resins 
increased to 615 molhg, marking a notable 
enhancement.34 These resins are capable of 
absorbing light with wavelengths extending up to 
approximately 700 nm 34 through simulation of 
visible light radiation in water with an O2
