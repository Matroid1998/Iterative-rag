Description:
Undergoes lipase catalyzed acylation at C5OH.

More streamlined approaches have 
subsequently been reported4,5,6,7,8, however these routes rely on chemical methods to install the N
hydroxy unit, which require elevated temperatures, prolonged reaction times, andor additional steps 
for activation and protectiondeprotection chemistry. These factors compromise reaction yields and 
process productivity, ultimately leading to increased costs. We sought to develop a more efficient and sustainable route to 1 that could be implemented on scale, 
where modification of the base to install the Nhydroxy unit is achieved catalytically using an 
engineered enzyme. Since Nhydroxycytidine 4 has previously been shown to undergo lipase 
catalyzed acylation at C5OH4,5, this approach would provide an integrated biocatalytic process to 
Molnupiravir 1 from readily available starting materials.
