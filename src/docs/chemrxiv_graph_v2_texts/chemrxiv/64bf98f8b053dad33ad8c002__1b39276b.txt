Description:
Compounds that can be transformed into high energy density liquid fuels.

Carbonhydrogen (CH) bonds are among the strongest chemical linkages in nature and thus inherently 
unreactive. Still, manipulating carbonhydrogen bonds holds the key to numerous molecular 
transformations that are essential in organic and metalorganic synthesis within the context of green 
chemistry, the design of new pharmaceuticals or the transformation of low molecular weight 
hydrocarbons to high energy density liquid fuels (1). However, since CH bonds lack considerable 
polarity, their manipulation via activation and functionalization is challenging due to significant energy 
barriers needed to be overcome under ambient conditions. One way of activating CH bonds is using 
phototriggered transition metal complexes (2, 3).
