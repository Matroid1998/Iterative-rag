In 
fact, the ironcyclopentadienyl (FeCp) bond dissociation energy 
(BDE) of 90 kcal mol1 is similar to that of a typical covalent C
C bond.16 As a result, the excellent redox properties and robust
ness made this metallocene class of materials particularly attrac
tive for diverse applications that span polymer science,17,18 sens
ing,19,20 catalysis,19,21 biochemistry,22 or molecular electronics.19,23 
Imparting strain to Fc increases the propensity of this otherwise 
inert compound to undergo a cleavage of the FeCp bond. This
