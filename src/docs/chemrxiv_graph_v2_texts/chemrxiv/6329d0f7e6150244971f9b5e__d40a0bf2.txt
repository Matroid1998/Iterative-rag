Description:
Catalyst surface enhanced through electron withdrawing effects by fluoride ions for effective catalytic sites in electrochemical water oxidation.

Text:
In our previous works, we showed that the oxyfluoride catalyst surface, enhanced through 
electron withdrawing effects imparted by the fluoride ions, gives rise to highly effective catalytic sites for 
electrochemical water oxidation.22, 23, 25 We reasoned that the inductive effect of the electronegative fluorine 
anions incorporated in the metal oxide network would also modulate the activity of the Cubased materials 
for NO3R. With the above criteria in mind, we prepared a new oxyfluoride, Cu3Al2OF10, via precipitation and 
annealing of the corresponding hydrated fluorides Cu3Al2F12(H2O)12. This mixed metal cations CuAl 
oxyfluoride will add to the few cases reported in the literature such as CuWO3F226 and Ca2CuO2F2.527 
prepared through either solid state chemistry or via reaction of the corresponding oxides with F2.

Description:
The first material of its kind applied towards NO3R.

Text:
Remarkably, Cu3Al2OF10 is highly active for the 8electron NO3R, attaining upwards of 57 Faradaic 
Efficiency (FE) and 1220 A.g1 mass activity. As such, this is the first oxyfluoride material applied towards 
NO3R. A complementary set of electroanalytical and operando spectroscopic investigations were carried 
out to elucidate that the Cu sites are indeed the active sites for the reaction and that the rate limiting step is
