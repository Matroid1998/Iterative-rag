Since it has been reported 
that the several existing drug showed potential against COVID19 including oseltamivir,6 
lopinavir,7 ritonavir,7 remdesivir,8 favipiravir,9 ribavirin,9 chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine.10 Since most of the drugs are HIV protease inhibitors11 we have 
performed their docking with COVID19 main protease downloaded from protein data 
bank (PDB ID 7BRP). Some of the Potential Therapeutic Target Against SARSCoV and 
SARSCoV2 Several similarities between SARSCoV2 and SARSCoV have been 
reported. Since the sequencing of SARSCoV2 has been done,12 it has given rise to 
various molecular modeling experiments to find the potential candidate against novel
