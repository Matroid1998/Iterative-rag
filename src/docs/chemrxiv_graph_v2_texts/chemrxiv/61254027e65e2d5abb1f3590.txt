Description:
A gas that is produced when InN decomposes at about 550 C.

Text:
The growth of InN is problematic due to its low thermal stability; InN decomposes to In 
metal and nitrogen gas at about 550 C.8 This has also been manifested by its high equilibrium 
pressure with nitrogen, which has led to attempts at depositing InN at very high nitrogen 
pressures.9,10,11 Due to slow decomposition kinetics of ammonia (NH3),12 the most common 
nitrogen precursor in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), NIn ratios in the order of 104 has 
often been used in CVD of InN.13 Alternative N precursors, such as dimethylhydrazine and 
tertiarybuthylhydrazine, has been shown ineffective for the growth of InN.14 To allow more 
reactive N species, plasmaassisted approach has been adapted in various growth techniques, 
such as molecule beam epitaxy,15,16,17 sputtering18 and metalorganic CVD19 for the growth of 
InN.

Description:
Used in plasma form for the ALD of crystalline InN films.

Text:
We have previously hypothesized that steering the deposition chemistry fully to the surface 
could be an alternative route for low temperature CVD of InN as it could circumvent the 
problem of the slow kinetics in the gas phase decomposition of NH3. A CVD approach fully 
relying on surface chemistry is atomic layer deposition (ALD), which uses a sequential supply 
of the precursor gases to make the deposition chemistry surface controlled.20 ALD of 
crystalline InN films has been demonstrated using trimethyl indium (TMI) and either nitrogen 
plasma21,22 or NH3 plasma.23 In addition, complex precursors with chelating ligands with InN
