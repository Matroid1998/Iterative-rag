Description:
A polymer of aziridine with high loading of nitrogen bases, hydrophilicity, and water solubility.

As organic polymeric bases, polyamines are ubiquitous for many applications, ranging 
from biological drug deliveries12 to carbon capture.3 Polyethyleneimine (PEI, i.e., a polymer 
of aziridine) has been used in various applications owing to its high loading of nitrogen bases 
(theoretically up to 23 mmolg),4 hydrophilicity, and water solubility. In general, branched PEls 
are highly accessible. In contrast, linear and dendrimeric PEIs require sophisticated preparation 
and synthetic strategies despite having unique properties due to their uniform alkylation 
degrees on nitrogen atoms.5 Hydrophobic PEI is achievable via selective alkylations on the 
nitrogens, thereby enabling the control of PEI derivatives solubility, structure, dynamics, and 
stimuliresponsive applications. Stimuliresponsive polymers, which alter their properties in response to environmental 
changes, offer a novel and potentially energysaving approach for water purification and 
regeneration.
