driven formation of nanoclusters on closely packed transition metal surfaces, such as 
22 
Cu(111)9, Au(111)10 or bimetallic alloys11, has been reported with reducing agents, 
23 
including CO911 and H12. These adsorbateinduced nanoclusters have been suggested 
24 
to play an important role for heterogeneous catalysis89, 13. The oxidationinduced 
25 
breaking of metalmetal bonds has been of particular interest, as catalytic reactions 
26 
typically involve oxidants that adsorb to surfaces strongly and could induce an 
27 
evolution of activesite configurations. The elucidation of activesite formation 
28 
dynamics and mechanisms necessitates atomic scale visualization of oxidationinduced
