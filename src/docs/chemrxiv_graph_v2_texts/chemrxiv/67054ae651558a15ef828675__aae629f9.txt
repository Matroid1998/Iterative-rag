Description:
A type of boron nitride.

Text:
Current practical synthesis methods include Nags boric 
acidurea1 and chemical vapor deposition.49 Other types of boron nitride (BN) include cuboidal 
BN, rhombohedral BN, and wurtzite BN.10 Cubic BN is thermally stable up to 1000 C, with a 
phase transition from cBN to hBN reported between 1000 and 1800 C.11,6,12 
hBN is thermally conductive and electrically insulating with a low density (2.27gcm3)4,13 and 
high thermal stability1416. Like graphite, hBN consists of layers of individual sheets stacked to 
form flakes or particles.
