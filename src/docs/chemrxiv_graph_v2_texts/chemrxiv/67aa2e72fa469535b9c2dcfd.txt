Description:
Experimentally difficult to accurately determine the positions of hydrogen atoms.

Most databases used in computational studies source their data from the CSD Database. In most cases, a structure deposed in the CSD Database cannot be used directly in a compu
tational study. The CIF files deposited in the CSD are not aimed to be used by computational
studies. For example, experimentally, it is diicult to accurately determine the positions of
hydrogen atoms. It is common practice to report atomic occupancies that are not equal
to one as overlapping atoms. In addition, the structures are often reported to have solvent
molecules in the pores. The CoReMOF databases aimed to address these issues and provide
the community with a computationalready version of the MOF structures reported in the
CSD. One should not underestimate the complexity of cleaning these experimental structures.
