Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding, which is significant in determining the local structure of molecules.

Text:
When considering polar molecules, with an in
ner distribution of partial charges, charge order still dominates the local order,
although this is usually explained in terms of dipolar order. The quantum
origin of interactions becomes apparent when considering hydrogen bonding
molecules, especially when spectroscopic methods are used to investigate their
local structures 8, 9, 10. Even though classical models of liquids such as wa
ter are quite good for describing the local structure, as demonstrated by the
comparison of the pair correlation functions obtained from radiation scattering
and computer simulations 11, 12, 13, it is not obvious to appreciate which of
the full quantum or classical approaches is better to understand all the prob
lems posed by the structure of hydrogen bonding liquids.

Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds in labile clusters affecting the understanding of liquids.

Text:
In the present work, we would like to examine the problem posed by the
in uence of the local structure of hydrogen bonded labile clusters on the global
understanding of these liquids, under two dierent perspectives, one based of
charge order arguments, and the other on the importance of the dynamics of
the labile structures. For this, we investigate the atomatom pair correlation
functions of classical models of water, methanol and ethanol. Molecular dynam
ics simulations are conducted and dynamical atomatom correlation functions
are computed from the 5ns long trajectories. Details can be found in the Sup
plemental Information(SI). In general, it is found that all dynamical functions
are signi cantly decayed within 100ps. The calculated functions are as follows.
