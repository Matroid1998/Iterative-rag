Description:
Used in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes.

Nanoclusters are atomic aggregates that constitute the elemental 
unit of nanoscience. The transition metal clusters, with diameters 
ranging from 1 to 10 nm, are of significant theoretical and practical 
interest due to their actual and potential use in ultrahigh density 
magnetic recording materials, catalytic particles in the synthesis of 
carbon nanotubes and several applications in electronics and 
optics.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 Knowledge on geometrical structure plays an 
important role in the determination of several physicochemical 
properties of these nanoclusters.1,2 Theoretically, structure 
determination is conventionally done via electronic structure 
calculations using a variety of quantum chemical (QC) methods 
based on both wavefunction (Hartree Fock) and density functional 
theories. This is often a tedious, slow and computationally expensive 
process for medium and large size systems.
