A material matrix used to embed MOFs for easier processing.

MOFs embedded within a moreeasily processable material ma
trix such as graphene oxide or polymers, has gained increasing 
attention.6 
Recently, glasses formed by meltquenching zeolitic imidazo
late frameworks (ZIFs) have been demonstrated to offer prom
ising mechanical properties.7 ZIFs are a subgroup of highly 
thermally stable MOFs, composed of metal cations tetrahe
drally coordinated through imidazolate linkers.8The use of ZIF 
glasses as matrix materials within MOF composites can, for ex
ample, stabilize a metastable phase of MIL53 at room temper
ature.9 However, examples of meltquenched ZIF glasses re
main relatively rare and therefore their use as composite matri
ces is not a widely applicable approach.10 
In contrast, inorganic glasses are a broad family of materials 
with a vast number of applications, ranging from commodities 
such as architectural or container glasses to specialty glasses 
widely employed in biotechnology, photonics, nuclear waste 
management or solidstate electrolytes.11 In general, inorganic 
glasses avoid crystallisation either by having complex chemical 
compositions, also called principle of maximum confusion,12 
or by kinetically frustrating the crystallisation process by cool
ing the melt beyond its critical cooling rate.13 They are rela
tively cheap and wellstudied materials, though they are almost
