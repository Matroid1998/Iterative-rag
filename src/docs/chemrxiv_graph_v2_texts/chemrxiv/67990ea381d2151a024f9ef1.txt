Description:
A metal used in triple doping to improve photocatalytic performance.

Text:
The emerging problems of antibiotic resistance (AMR) and superbugs have led to intensive research 
on photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and microbial disinfection. Titanium dioxide is the most 
widely used photocatalyst due to its nontoxicity, easy availability, and chemical and mechanical 
stability, but it does not work effectively under visible light or sunlight. The effects of chemical 
modification include increasing the adsorption capacity (impurities can act as active sites for 
contaminant adsorption) and reducing recombination, creating new energy levels (impurity regions) 
for efficient photogenerated charge separation. Triple doping of metals (Ce, Y, Zn, Fe, V, Ni), non
metals (B, N, C, S), and Ag (silver) provides a synergy of properties that help improve photocatalytic 
performance.
