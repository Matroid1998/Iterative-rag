Description:
Forms part of the pyridine rings in hemiaminal 6, adopting enantiomeric CD-active helical configurations.

Text:
Covalent binding of an enantioenriched analyte 2 induces a 
conformational bias in the chiroptical sensor. The resultant CDsignal 
can be used to determine the enantioenrichment of 2. One of our groups has been particularly interested in developing chi
roptical sensors of enantioenriched alcohols (Figure 2). We have shown 
that 2formylpyridine (4) can efficiently react with dipicolylamine (5) 
and Zn(OTf)2 in the presence of an acid catalyst (chloroethylmorpho
line hydrochloride, CEMHCl) to form hemiaminal 6 (Figure 2A).2,7 
The pyridine rings in 6 adopt enantiomeric CDactive helical configu
rations (P and M, depicted in red and blue, respectively).

Description:
Exhibits a helical twist upon binding with a chiral alcohol.

Text:
Upon binding 
of a chiral alcohol 7, a series of diastereomers form by virtue of the 
pyridine helical twist, the chiral alcohol, and the newly formed point 
stereocenter of the hemiaminal ether functional group. If the alcohol is
