Text:
reported the synthesis of the first difunctionalized ciscyclooctene 
(CCO) with an allylic moiety in seven steps starting from cis,cis1,5cyclooctadiene (1,5COD, 
Figure 1A).16 The authors reported the formation of a mixture of the axial and equatorial 
difunctionalized TCO derivatives after isomerization with UVlight and a sensitizer as 
described by the Fox group (Figure 1B).22 Currently, the synthetic accessibility of the most 
commonly used difunctionalized TCOs with releasing properties is rather problematic, mainly 
due to low yielding steps and a lengthy overall synthesis.16, 23 Ideally, a TCO should have 
multiple orthogonal handles, a fast click reaction with a tetrazine and a rapid release 
functionality. In comparison with the difunctionalized TCO of Rossin et al., a shorter and higher 
yielding synthesis method of a TCO with similar properties is desired.
