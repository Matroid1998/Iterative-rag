Description:
Halogenated arenes are important substrates for directed metallation reactions.

Text:
Heteroaromatics and benzene derivatives constitute important structural classes in drug discovery, agrochemistry, and material
science. Their halogenated derivatives are often applied as substrates in carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom crosscoupling
reactions such as SuzukiMiyaura, Heck, and BuchwaldHartwig couplings.1;2 The prerequisite (hetero)aryl halides are
typically prepared by electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS).3 Halogenated arenes are also important substrates for directed
metallation reactions and for the generation of organolithium and organomagnesium species by metalhalogen exchange, metal
insertion, or direct metallation.4 Unlike the benzene series for which the relative reactivity of the substrates is textbook
knowledge, it is not a priori obvious at which position(s) halogenation will occur for heteroaromatic systems, especially in
compounds that contain multiple (hetero)aromatic rings or in compounds that contain both heteroarene and benzene rings.
