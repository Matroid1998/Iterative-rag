Description:
A prochiral unit that contributes to facial dissymmetry in a macrocycle.

However, to 
our knowledge, the only MGI1 rotaxanes in which a single 
covalent prochiral center differentiates the faces of the 
ring,9 as envisaged by Schill, were reported by Bode and 
Saito,10 where no stereoselectivity was reported. More recently,11 we identified that when a facially dissym
metric macrocycle encircles a prochiral axle an overlooked 
mechanically axially chiral (MAC)12 stereogenic unit arises 
that is analogous to that of catenanes identified by Wasser
man and Frisch over 60 years earlier.13 Having made this ob
servation, we demonstrated that such molecules can be syn
thesized using a diastereoselective coconformational chi
ral auxiliary14 active template15 Cumediated alkyneazide 
cycloaddition (ATCuAAC16,17) approach with a ring whose 
facial dissymmetry arises from a single prochiral sulfoxide 
unit.
