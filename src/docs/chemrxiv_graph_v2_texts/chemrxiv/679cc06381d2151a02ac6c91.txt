Description:
A drug commonly used in pediatric cancer treatment known to cause dose-dependent bone marrow suppression and cardiotoxicity.

Text:
As an example of possible side effects, Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most commonly 
used drugs in pediatric cancer treatment, is commonly observed to cause dosedependent bone marrow 
suppression (shortterm) and cardiotoxicity (longterm).912 
Physicians rely on observational methods to make dose adjustments and reduce chemotherapy doses 
based on the severity of side effects.4 However, these cytotoxic drugs have a very narrow therapeutic 
window where the maximum tolerable dose for that patient and the dose that has therapeutic effect on 
the tumor are very close.1315 Excessive dose reductions to mitigate side effects may result in under
dosing, compromising tumor control.16 The effectiveness of chemotherapy dosing is typically only 
assessed 6 to 8 weeks after treatment initiation by evaluating tumor size.17 If tumor progression is 
observed, physicians may switch to a different drug.18 These decisions are made without knowing the
