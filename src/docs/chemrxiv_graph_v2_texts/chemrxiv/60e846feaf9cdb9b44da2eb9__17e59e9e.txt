Description:
Achieves large brightness using a macrocyclic triazacyclononane platform functionalized by a conjugated chromophore.

Text:
This quest strongly 
stimulates the researchers creativity as illustrated by the 
exceptional variety of polydentate or macrocyclic ligands 
published each year, where large brightness has been achieved 
using very different structures. As selected examples, record 
brightness has been obtained for (i) Eu(III) using macrocyclic 
triazacyclononane platform functionalized by a conjugated 
chromophore,18 (ii) Tb(III) thanks to a cryptate ligand1920 and 
(iii) Yb(III) using a sandwich complex between a porphyrin and 
a Kluis tripodal ligand.21 A large variety of chromophores 
have been tested as antenna among which polyaromatic dyes 
(anthracene, 
pyrene),2223 
xanthene24 
and 
coumarin
