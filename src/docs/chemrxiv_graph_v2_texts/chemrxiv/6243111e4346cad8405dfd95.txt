Throughout history, different natural sources have been used as valuable suppliers of 
49 
biologically active compounds with diverse bioactivities that can be used to develop new drugs 
50 
16. Marine organisms and microorganisms were among the valuable sources of new natural 
51 
products 2. Microbial secondary metabolites have been known for their chemical diversity 
52 
and broad range of bioactivities 6,7. Marine microorganisms have been considered as highly 
53 
productive sources of physiologically active compounds including peptides, anthraquinones, 
54 
polyketides, terpenes, and alkaloids 810. Some marinebased compounds have been 
55 
approved as drugs with different pharmacological uses 11,12, while several others are under 
56 
different clinical trials before their approval as new drugs 11.
