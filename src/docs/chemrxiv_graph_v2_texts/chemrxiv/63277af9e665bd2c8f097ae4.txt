Description:
Primary exhaust emissions produced when fuel is burned.

The production of greenhouse gases has had an adverse impact on humans and their activities since the 
beginning of the industrial age. When fuel is burned, primary exhaust emissions such as nitrogen oxides, 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and particulate matter are produced. Primary pollutants in 
the atmosphere react to produce secondary pollutants, leading to acid rain, photochemical smog, and 

tropospheric ozone depletion. Many of these pollutants have serious impacts on human health and the 
environment (13) and may be minimized by various suggested approaches (4,5). Biodiesel is an alternative fuel similar to conventional diesel or fossil diesel. The processes used to convert 
vegetable oils into biodiesel include transesterification or micro emulsions.
