Description:
A narrow-gap semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling leading to topologically protected gaps.

Text:
Reactions in molten fluxes can lead to such kineticallytrapped metastable
phases unobtainable by direct combination of elements,1 and these methods have proven
to be prolific in producing new chalcogenide materials in particular.2 These compounds are
typically narrowgap semiconductors and heavy elements lead to strong spinorbit coupling,
which can lead to topologically protected gaps, such as in TlBiS2 3 and Bi2Se3.4 Given the
nascent field of crystal growth for nontrivial topology, the identification and highquality
growth of these materials is invaluable. Unfortunately, the reaction vessels obscure the progression of phase nucleation, growth,
and transformation.
