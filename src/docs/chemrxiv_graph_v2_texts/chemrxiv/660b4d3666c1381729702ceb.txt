Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding capacities related to selectivity in RPLC stationary phases.

Text:
This model can be considered a datadriven model, in that the solute and 
74 
stationary phase parameters are derived from retention measurements, rather than externally 
75 
calculated or measured physicochemical parameters. The HSM1 provides descriptive parameters 
76 
for RPLC stationary phases that relate to their hydrophobicities, hydrogen bonding capacities, 
77 
capacities for involvement in ionic interactions, and the contributions of steric effects to their 
78 
overall selectivities. These characteristics are obtained from the following equation. 79
