Description:
Used as an additive to control evaporation and condensation processes.

Text:
For example, when drops are deposited on partially wettable surfaces, conditions in 
which the drop evaporates with a constant contact angle and decreasing contact area minimize the 
evaporative gradient, leading to the formation of uniform 3D colloidal crystals with spherical cap 
geometry.29,30 Fewer available strategies have proven suitable for the deposition of ordered monolayers,31 
and are often limited to functionalized nanoparticles32 or engineered microgel particles,33 to minimize 
sedimentation and favour adsorption to the airwater (aw) interface rather than to the substrate. More 
generic approaches take advantage of controlled evaporation34condensation,35 often using a cosolvent19 or 
additives like ethylene glycol or formamide,36 but remain limited to relatively small defectfree monolayers 
and require a tightly controlled, and often long, evaporation process. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20231jssg ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000317723080 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.
