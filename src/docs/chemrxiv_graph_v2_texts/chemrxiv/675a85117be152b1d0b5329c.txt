Description:
Used in nanoparticles with cationic or anionic surfaces affecting protein binding and cellular interactions.

Text:
12 studied how BSA adsorption on polystyrene NPs with cathionic or anionic surface affects cellular 
binding of resulted proteinNP complex. It was found, that the cellular binding of BSAcationic NP complexes is 
enhanced, whereas the cellular binding of BSAanionic NP complexes is inhibited. Difference in NP surface charge 
in BSANP complexes also resulted in different receptor binding on cell surface. Difference in the cellular binding
