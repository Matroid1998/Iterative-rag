Description:
A 7-membered monomer that undergoes quantitative conversion when initiated with BF3Et2O.

Text:
In 2000, Endos group 
observed quantitative conversions of the 7membered monomer thionocaprolactone 
when initiated with BF3Et2O.14 The lanthanide triflateinitiated CROP of the 5
membered homologue thionobutyrolactone reported in 2005 by the same group, on 
the other hand, gave lower conversions (5378) and low SECmeasured molar 
masses (3.46.3 kgmol).15 A screening of different cationic initiators for the same 
cyclic monomer and substituted derivatives by Xia et al. in 2023 showed 
Et3OB(C6F5)4 to be the ideal candidate to achieve efficient polymerization and a 
high degree of polymer crystallinity.16 During the writing of this manuscript, Peng et 
al. reported 
the 
BF3Et2Oinitiated 
CROP 
of 
the 
dibenzosubstituted
