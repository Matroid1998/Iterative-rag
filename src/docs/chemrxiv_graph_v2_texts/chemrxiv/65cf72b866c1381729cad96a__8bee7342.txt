10, 11 Therefore, there is a need 
for the development of new nanomaterials for bioelectrode fabrication. Previous research has focused on the use of flexible conductive polymers to wire the enzymes 
onto 
the 
electrodes, 
with 
common 
substrates 
including 
poly(3,4
ethylenedioxythiophenepolystyrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOTPSS).12 Setti et al13 fabricated 
electrodes with PEDOTPSSGOx matrixes through thermal inkjet printing, which while 
promising, suffered from stability issues (e.g. PEDOTPSS dissolves in electrolyte) and involved
