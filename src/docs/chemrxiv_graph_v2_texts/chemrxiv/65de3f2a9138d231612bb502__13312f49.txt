Description:
Atoms that covalently bond with transition metals in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Text:
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a group of materials that are composed of a 
transition metal atom M from Group III or IV covalently connecting to two chalcogen atoms X in 
a hexagonal lattice. 1 The layered structure exhibits weak interlayer van der Walls interaction, 
which reduces the electrostatic screening and thereby gives rise to novel manybody interactions 
between charge carriers2. At the monolayer limit, the reduced dimensionality, combined with 
the reduction of screening for Coulomb interactions, leads to the emergence of various robust 
quasiparticles even at room temperature. These includes excitons3, trions4 and biexciton5, 
several of which are unattainable in other systems6,7. Trions, for instance, are one such charged 
excitons, i.e. one exciton bounded with an additional charge carrier.
