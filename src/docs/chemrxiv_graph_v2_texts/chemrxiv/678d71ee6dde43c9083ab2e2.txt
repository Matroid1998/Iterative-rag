Description:
Molecules in the reaction center of Photosystem II that convert visible light to electron flow.

Text:
Photosystem II
(PSII) of oxygenic photosynthesis1 is one of the most
important potential blueprints for artificial lightdriven
chargeseparating devices.24
The four chlorophyll
and two pheophytin molecules that comprise the
reaction center (RC) of PSII (Figure 1) are able to
convert with ultimate efficiency visible light to electron
flow, powering water oxidation and plastoquinone
reduction.57 Three main factors need to be elucidated
for understanding the function of the PSII RC,
each factor representing a substantial challenge for
both
experiment
and
theory
a)
the
electronic
structure of the pigments themselves, b) the influence
of the protein environment in terms of structure
and electrostatics,
and c) the role that dynamic
motion plays in modulating the electronic structure,
absorption properties, and function of RC pigments.

Since the initial charge separation is intimately tied to
the light absorption process, the electronic structure
analysis must encompass the ground state and the
spectrum of lowlying excited states. Figure 1 The chlorophyll and pheophytin pigments comprising
the reaction center of PSII. Important additional cofactors of
PSII are also indicated. The primary charge separation occurs
among pigments of the D1 protein, initiated either within
the ChlD1PheoD1 or the PD1PD2 pairs, following direct light
absorption or excitation energy transfer from intrernal and
external light harvesting complexes. The arrows depict the
flow of electrons from the donor side (water oxidation) to the
acceptor side (plastoquinone reduction).
