Involved in the oxygen evolution half-reaction with a thermodynamic limit of 1.23 V in water.

However, watersoluble TEMPO de
rivatives remain uneconomical, with a low oxidation poten
tial of 0.8 V vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) com
pared to the thermodynamic limit of 1.23 V in water im
posed by the oxygen evolution halfreaction.19,20 Viologen 
derivatives have similarly been explored as anolyte materi
als due to their highly reversible 12 redox couple with 
a standard reduction potential of 0.45 V vs. SHE.16,21 How
ever, with a molecular weight of 257 gmol (vs. 156 gmol 
for TEMPO), batteries based on methyl viologen are un
likely to satisfy capital cost requirements for commercial vi
ability.3 Additionally, the use of separate electrolytes for the 
anode and cathode results in capacity fade with chemical 
crossover driven by concentration gradients.22 The discov
ery of new stable organic radical scaffolds may therefore 
unlock performance and cost targets unachievable with cur
rent materials.
