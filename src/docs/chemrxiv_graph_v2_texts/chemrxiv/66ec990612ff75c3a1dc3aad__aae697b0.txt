Description:
Functionalized monomeric compounds used in the synthesis of dimeric molecules.

Text:
The exploration of LDIs has encountered major delays in 
the process of synthesizing such dimers due to a focus on 
onestep methods for condensing functionalized mono
meric silicon phthalocyanines into dimeric molecules. As 
such, due to novel condensation pathways needing to be 
discovered for each desired axial functional group, progress 
on the generation of required novel species is determined 
primarily by the similarity of the ligand to those used in ex
isting synthetic pathways. Additionally, the purification re
quires a timeconsuming chromatography procedure which 
must be developed and completed, wherein the target di
mer must be separated from unreacted monomer side prod
uct.
