Description:
An intermediate formed when an I(III) reagent reacts with an enol derivative at low temperature.

Iodine(III) 
compounds have been used in this context to mediate the coupling of the two nucleophilic reactants through two
electron oxidations, thereby inverting the polarity of one of the reagents.5 This strategy has recently been termed 
crossnucleophile coupling.6 This area has evolved significantly7 since the first report. 8 When it comes to 
heteroatomic nucleophiles, the reaction usually requires a Lewis acid, as well as a low reaction temperature, in a 
onepot twostep procedure, to avoid formation of byproducts (Figure 1a).9 First the I(III) reagent and the enol 
derivative react at low temperature to form an enolonium intermediate.9a This ensures that the enol nucleophile is 
consumed before the second nucleophile is added at higher temperature (Figure 1a).
