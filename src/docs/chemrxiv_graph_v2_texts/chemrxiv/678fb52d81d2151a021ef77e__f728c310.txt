Description:
An anode material where first cycle losses are generally attributed to solid electrolyte interphase formation.

Cracking in polycrystalline cathode materials has been considered detrimental to cell 
performance as it exposes fresh surfaces to electrolyte, reduces effective ionic and electronic 
conduction pathways, and can facilitate the formation of inactive regions over time.1,2 
Cracking has traditionally been attributed to unit cell anisotropic volumetric hysteresis after 
extended cycling, as studies often observe cracking in discharged materials typically after 
many cycles.3 However, recent findings suggest that high voltages in the first cycle can also 
induce immediate intergranular cracking, initiating degradation pathways before ageing 
begins.35 This phenomenon may reduce early cycle performance by exposing fresh surfaces 
to parasitic reactions with the electrolyte, however, first cycle losses are generally attributed 
to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the graphite anode, and therefore cracking present in 
early cycles may not be catastrophic to cell performance initially.2 Additionally, oxygen 
release can coincide with crystallographic reconstruction into an inactive reduced surface 
layer, and eventually a rocksalt (Fm3m) phase.610
