Description:
Ions in the electrolyte should be sufficiently mobile, important for fast charging and discharging in lithium ion batteries.

Text:
Liquid electrolytes have gained a lot of traction in design and development of lithium ion
batteries (LIBs) for electric vehicles over the last decades. Understanding the design of
complex electrolytes has been studied widely in both simulations and experiments.15 The
requirements for electrolytes for LiBs are manifold First, suitable formulations should be
electrochemically stable, at least in a kinetic sense, implying that stable passivation layers
such as the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) are readily formed.6,7 Second, the lithium
ions in the electrolyte should be sufficiently mobile, which is especially important for fast
charging and discharging.
