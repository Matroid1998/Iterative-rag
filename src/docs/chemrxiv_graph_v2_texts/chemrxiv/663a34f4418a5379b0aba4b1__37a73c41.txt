Description:
Utilized in the surface chemistry of AlN in ALD processes.

Text:
ALD of AlN has garnered 
significant attention for applications demanding robust protective layers, such as the 
development of corrosionresistant, insulating and protective coatings.7 
ALD is based on sequential, selflimiting surface chemical reactions, enabled by carefully tuned 
deposition chemistry and an alternating precursor supply onto the substrate. This leads to the 
hallmark of ALD conformal deposition on topologically complex surfaces. The alternating 
surface chemistry also facilitates studies of the surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms as the 
surface is only exposed to one type of precursor molecule at a time. Puurunen et al.810 have 
explored the surface chemistry of AlN using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and ammonia (NH3) by 
infrared (IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on porous silica 
and alumina.
