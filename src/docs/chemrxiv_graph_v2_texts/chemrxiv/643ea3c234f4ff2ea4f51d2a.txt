Description:
A pyrene-based traditional photoacid.

Text:
Traditional photoacids are pyrenebased compounds such as 8hydroxypyrene1,3,6
trisulfonate 
(pyranine, 
HPTS, 

1.0) 
and 
8aminopyrene1,3,6trisulfonate 

3 

(APTS, 
 7.0).1618 These values are, respectively, 6.4 and 10  units decreased 
compared to the acidities in their S0 states. Derivatives of APTS are reported to have even lower 

, e.g., the superphotoacid tris(2,2,2triuoroethyl)8aminopyrene1,3,6trisulfonate 
(TTFAPTS,   0.5 and 
  12.9).19 
Assessments of  and 
 are possible by both experimental and computational methods. The  of an acid is determined by measuring the different concentrations of the acid and the 
conjugate base species in solutions at different pH values.9,20 UVVis spectroscopy is a useful 
analytical method for such experiments.
