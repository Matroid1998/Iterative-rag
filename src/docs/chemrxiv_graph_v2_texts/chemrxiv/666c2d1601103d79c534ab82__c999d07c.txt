Description:
An electrochemically active material used in composite anodes.

Text:
In these composite systems, a sufficiently 
high ionic (ion) and electronic (e) conductivity, as well as balancing of the two transport 
quantities is of paramount importance to enable high electrode utilizations and to avoid reaction 
fronts during charging and discharging.6,7 
On the one hand, charge carrier transport can be decisively influenced by varying the 
volumetric ratios of the electrode components given that the electrochemically active material 
and carbon additives are solely responsible for the electronic conduction, while the solid 
electrolyte exclusively conducts ions.8,9 With that, altering the SE content in composite anodes, 
such as Li4Ti5O12Li7P2S8IC10 or SiLi6PS5Cl (LPSCl)C11, can facilitate changes in the 
effective ionic conductivity over orders of magnitude.
