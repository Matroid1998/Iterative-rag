Description:
Nanoparticles with explored eco-friendly synthesis and antimicrobial activities.

Text:
Nanoparticles have attracted significant attention across diverse domains for their 
substantial contributions to drug delivery and targeting. They effectively minimize toxicity, 
enhance efficacy, and create novel avenues for pharmaceutical and drug delivery enterprises 
1,2,3. Capping agents play a crucial role in functionalizing and stabilizing synthesized 
nanoparticles, serving as biologically acceptable reducing, stabilizing, or capping agents. These 
agents are carefully chosen to ensure compatibility with living systems 4,5. They play a pivotal 
role in shielding nanoparticles from agglomeration and enhancing reduction kinetics by forming 
complex structures with metallic ions in precursor salts 6,7. Several studies have explored the ecofriendly synthesis and antimicrobial activities of 
copper nanoparticles (CuNPs). For instance, Javier et al.

Description:
Used in nanoparticle synthesis with antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.

Text:
8 detailed the synthesis, while Amer 
and Awwad 9 utilized the aqueous extract of Citrus limon fruits for copper nanoparticle 
synthesis. Other green synthesis methods involved Punica granatum 10, Prunus mahaleb L. 11, 
and citron juice (Citrus medica Linn.) 12. The antimicrobial efficacy of biologically synthesized 
copper nanoparticles was assessed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus 13. Biological methods employed plant extracts, bacteria, and fungi 14, with studies on CuNPs and 
AgCuNPs targeting udder inflammation pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia 
coli 15. Antimicrobial resistance is a persistent natural occurrence, exacerbated by factors such as 
excessive and illicit antimicrobial use, inappropriate dosage, subtherapeutic dosing, and 
noncompliance with prescribed treatment courses 16.
