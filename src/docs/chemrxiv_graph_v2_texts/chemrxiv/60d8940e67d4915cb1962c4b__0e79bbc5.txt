Description:
Contains an amino group and can affect emission properties by promoting metal atom coupling.

Text:
Ligands with amino group of anthranilic acid derivative backbones 
may affect the properties of the resulting emissions by promoting the coupling of metal atoms 
through its emission systems. It has been of interest to use photoactive ligands as building blocks 
to generate supramolecular polymers. Some of these workers have been concerned with the 
influence of structural changes upon the chemiluminescent properties.1213
