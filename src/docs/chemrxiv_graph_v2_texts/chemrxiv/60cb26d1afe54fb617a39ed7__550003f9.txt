Description:
A heteroatom-substituted aluminophosphate used as a catalyst.

Text:
The aluminophosphate zeotype AlPO11 was among the first AlPO4based molecular sieves, 
reported in a seminal paper by Wilson, Flanigen and coworkers in 1982.1 AlPO11 is the type 
material of the AEL (AlPO4ELeven) framework type code assigned by the International Zeolite 
Association.2 In addition to the pure AlPO4 form, several heteroatomsubstituted derivatives 
have been reported, including the silicoaluminophosphate SAPO11,3 the germanoalumino
phosphate GeAPO11,4 and metal (silico)aluminophosphates containing Mg, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, 
or Zn, among other metals.5,6 These heteroatomsubstituted systems, especially SAPO11, 
have received considerable attention as catalysts and catalyst supports.7,8 The most 
prominent application of AELtype frameworks is the use of bifunctional PtSAPO11 catalysts 
for hydroisomerisation and hydrocracking reactions.914 Application examples using 
monofunctional (nondoped) catalysts include the skeletal isomerisation of 1pentene and m
xylene using SAPO11 and CoAPO11,1517 the hydroxylation of phenol with Fe, Mn, Co, or 
CuAPO11,18,19 and the potential use of SAPO11 and CrAPSO11 in methanoltoolefin 
transformations.20 With regard to adsorption applications, AlPO11 has been proposed as a 
suitable adsorbent to recover methane from biogas using pressure swing adsorption,21 
whereas CoAPO11 has been recently tested for the adsorption of phenol from cigarette 
smoke.22 On a more fundamental level, AlPO11 can serve as a model system to study the 
structure and dynamics of molecules under confinement, as demonstrated for the case of 
adsorbed iodine molecules.2325 
The structure of the calcined form of AlPO11 was refined from powder neutron diffraction data 
by Richardson et al.,26 based on a model proposed earlier by Bennett and Smith.27,28 The 
aristotype of the AEL framework has  symmetry (a nonconventional setting of space 
group , employed here in order to use the same axis system as for the lowersymmetry 
structures presented subsequently).
