Description:
A dinuclear assembly with fluxional nature that complicates the study of its inherent reactivity.

Interestingly, a 
related 
electron 
deficient 
analogue 
featuring 
a 
di(p
nitrophenyl)methylene carbene, which was only observed as a 
mononuclear copper carbene complex, did mediate carbene 
transfer to alkenes. These two examples imply that nuclearity plays 
a key role in the reactivity, but the fluxional nature of the dinuclear 
assembly makes it challenging to study the inherent reactivity of 
dicopper carbenes. The use of dinucleating ligands, should inhibit the formation of 
monomeric complexes.
