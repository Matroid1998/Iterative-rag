Heterogeneous photocatalysis represents a vibrant research field13 with possible applications 
ranging from water detoxification4 to solar fuel generation5 and chemical synthesis.68 Due to 
its simplicity, selective photooxidation of benzyl alcohols is often employed in photocatalysis 
as a model reaction for evaluation of the performance of various photocatalysts.915 A 
prominent example is the photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide, an attractive high
value compound that can be employed as a fuel or a versatile and nontoxic oxidizing agent 
in various industrial processes, via reduction of dioxygen with concomitant photooxidation of 
benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.1618 As a rule, a blank test intended to confirm the 
photocatalytic nature of the reaction is performed by irradiating the solution of benzyl alcohol 
or other electron donor in the absence of photocatalyst, thus ruling out possible photochemical 
reactions which the substrate might undergo.
