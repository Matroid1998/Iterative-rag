Description:
Exhibits high HER catalytic activity due to its ability to bind hydrogen atoms.

Text:
The high 
HER catalytic activity of Wbased materials (such as tungsten carbide, tungsten nitride, and 
tungsten oxide) can be attributed to their ability to bind hydrogen atoms 9, 10, 11, 12. Tungsten has a 
relatively high electronegativity (2.36) and a low work function (4.8 eV), which allows it to easily 
accept electrons from hydrogen molecules and form strong tungstenhydrogen bonds 13, 14, 15, 16. The electronic structure of Wbased materials can be tuned by controlling composition and
