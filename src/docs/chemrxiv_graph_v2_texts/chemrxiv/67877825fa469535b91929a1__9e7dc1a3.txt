Description:
Form stable Lewis adducts when combined with Lewis bases and facilitate a range of ROP reactions.

Among them, organoboron compounds, where the electron
deficient boron exhibits metallike characteristics, are highly promising as metalfree catalysts.20,21 For 
example, trialkyl boranes, which form stable Lewis adducts when combined with Lewis bases, can 
facilitate a range of ROP reactions, such as the polymerization of epoxides and their copolymerization 
with carbon dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, isocyanates, and anhydrides.2227 
Although organoboron catalysts are generally known to have lower catalytic performance 
compared to many advanced metalbased catalysts and are known for their complex synthesis, recent 
developments suggest this perception is changing.
