Description:
A photoswitch used to gate reactions in light-controlled chemical processes.

Text:
Lightcontrolled chemical reactions have been established as a tool to achieve spatial and 
temporal control over chemical processes, making it possible to localize reactions or develop 
complex chemical networks. This tool can also be used for the regulation of biological 
processes, the development of smart materials, and the understanding of the complexity of 
nature.15 In lightcontrolled chemical reactions, light acts as an external stimulus on the gate, 
a substance that undergoes a certain photoreaction, providing remote control over the desired 
chemical process. To date, most photoswitches, such as azobenzene, spiropyran, and their 
derivatives, have been used to gate the reactions.616 In this work, we use a different type of 
photoresponsive molecule called a photobase of two different categories.
