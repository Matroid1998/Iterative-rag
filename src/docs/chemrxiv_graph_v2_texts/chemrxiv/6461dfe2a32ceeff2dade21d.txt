Description:
The first synthesis catalyst was discovered by Mittasch et al. at BASF in 1909.

Innovation is inversely related to the maturity of the research in any discipline. The 
conventional methodology of empirically and sequentially testing a limited number of samples is 
timeconsuming and highly suppositious. In contrast, the remarkable efficiency of high
throughput experimentation (HTE) provides for an alternative perspective outside the 
conventional practices as well as condensed experimental time to achieve systematic insights, 
leading to quicker discoveries.1 The key advantages of process automation and parallelization 
can generate reliable and consistent datasets in a short time of period. One of the first 
outstanding instances of the systematic screening of libraries was the discovery of the first 
ammonia synthesis catalyst at BASF by Mittasch et al. in 1909.
