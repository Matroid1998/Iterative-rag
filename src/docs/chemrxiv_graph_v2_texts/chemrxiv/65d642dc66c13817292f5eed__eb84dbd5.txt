Description:
A gel used for electrophoresis.

Text:
For purification, the crude product is subjected to co
polymerization under similar conditions widely used for preparing polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis, 
which involves N,Ndimethylacrylamide, N,Nmethylenebis(acrylamide), and radical initiators. The full

length sequences are copolymerized into the gel (4), and the impurities are removed by washing with water. Pure fulllength oligos (5) are cleaved from the gel by breaking the trityl ether bond in 4 with an acid and 
extracted with water.
