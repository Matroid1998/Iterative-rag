Description:
A core scaffold used in the development of novel degraders.

Text:
Indeed, one of the most clinically successful degraders, 
Revlimid (Lenalidomide), involves such a motif appended to an 
isoindolinone core.5, 6 While this scaffold has enjoyed a range of 
success against many targets, medicinal chemists have 
branched out beyond the isoindolinone in the development of 
novel degraders.
