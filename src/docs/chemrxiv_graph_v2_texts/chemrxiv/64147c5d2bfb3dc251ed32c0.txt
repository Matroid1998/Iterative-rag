Emitted from combustion and characterized by low and diluted concentrations in flue gas.

However globally, the most dominant source of emitted CO2 is from combustion, which is being discharged 
45 
as flue gas that are characterized by low and diluted CO2 concentrations in a typical range of 3 to 14 6. 46 
Due to its dilute nature, the CO2 gas stream from flue gases is in most cases unfeasible to be utilized directly 
47 
for the production of fuels and chemicals due to the limitations by the thermodynamic driving force, and it, 
48 
therefore, has to be captured and purified in an energy and costdemanding process 7.

A greenhouse gas targeted for capture and mitigation in flue gas streams.

The development of 
49 
a technology for mitigation of CO2 emissions from flue gas streams by the use of CCU is therefore imperative, 
50 
and the progress of these technologies to reduce the associated costs remain an essential element in the 
51 
journey toward carbon neutrality. 52 
One of the most mature technologies for postcombustion carbon capture has been the chemical scrubbing 
53 
technology with CO2selective aqueous systems using basic amines. Amine scrubbing has been commercially 
54 
available for decades and has been widely applied in industrial settings such as petrochemical plants, biogas 
55 
plants, and refineries for carbon capture.
