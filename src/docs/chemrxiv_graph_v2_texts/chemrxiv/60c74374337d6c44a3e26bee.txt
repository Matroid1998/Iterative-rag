The

of
the
CO2
electroreduction
(CO2ER) catalyst is an extremely important handle to rationally
optimize the overall performance of the system1. The concentra
tions of reactive as well as nonreactive species in the vicinity of
the catalyst surface, and their mutual interactions, have a direct
inuence on catalytic behaviour, and thus on the achievable ac
tivity and selectivity2,3. Mass transport becomes a crucial factor
for CO2ER due to the limited solubility of CO2 in aqueous elec
