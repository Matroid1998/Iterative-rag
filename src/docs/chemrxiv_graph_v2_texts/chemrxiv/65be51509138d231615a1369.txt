Description:
Compounds emitted from biomass burning that are oxidized in the atmosphere.

Biomass burning, including wildfires, emits large amounts of volatile organic compounds 
71 
(VOCs) into the atmosphere. One major class of VOCs emitted from biomass burning is phenolic 
72 
compounds.13 Once in the atmosphere, phenolic compounds will be oxidized by OH, O3, and NO3 
73 
to form lower volatility products, which can form new secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles 
74 
or partition to the particle phase to grow preexisting SOA.1,48 SOA can contribute to poor air 
75 
quality and can influence climate by directly scattering or absorbing solar radiation or by acting as 
76 
nuclei for clouds.9,10 
77 
To predict the environmental impacts of SOA, information on their volatility and chemical 
78 
composition is needed.
