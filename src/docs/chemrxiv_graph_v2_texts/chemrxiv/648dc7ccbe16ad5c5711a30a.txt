Description:
A mineral composed of lead sulfide (PbS) with faster dissolution rates along the 110 direction on the (001) surface under acidic conditions.

Both the mechanism (order
31
of bond breakage, changes to coordination environment, etc) and the barriers can be highly sensitive to cleavage
32
planes, surface termination, defects, and pitting (e.g. the type of exposed step edges) (Trindade Pedrosa et al., 2019,
33
Brandt et al., 2003, Bickmore et al., 2001, Kuwahara, 2011). Consider that prior scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
34
studies have reported dissolution rates for galena (PbS) that are much faster along the 110 direction instead of the
35
100 direction on the (001) surface under acidic conditions (Higgins and Hamers, 1996). In contrast, atomic force
36
microscopy (AFM) studies of pit dissolution at the (001) surface of gibbsite does not indicate any preference amongst
37
110, 010 and 100 step edges(Peskleway et al., 2003).
