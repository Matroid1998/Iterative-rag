Cheap and widely available sources used in synthesis.

Recently, a proposed change in EU law has raised concerns about a potential ban on a broad 
range of polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), including many CF3containing molecules 
and reagents.15 While legislation is yet to be finalized, exceptions are expected for final 
pharmaceutical and agrochemical active ingredients.16 However, the ban could still impact their 
synthesis if synthetic intermediates, the required bespoke reagents or other CF3containing 
sources were to be prohibited.17 Therefore, it becomes crucial to develop methods for 
synthesizing these moieties, at the late stage of a synthesis, from simple, nonfluorinated 
organic molecules, ideally utilizing cheap and widely available alkali fluoride sources for 
which no restrictions are foreseen.

Description:
Salts used as a fluorine source in the preparation of trifluoromethylheteroatom anions.

Text:
Such an approach would not only comply with the proposed 
EU law but also minimize or eliminate the need for perfluorinated materials in synthesizing 
most of the currently used fluoroalkylating reagents. To tackle these synthetic, legislative and environmental challenges, our strategy centered 
around the development of a versatile protocol capable of generating N, S and OCF3 anions 
on demand, and facilitate their immediate use as nucleophiles (Figure 1C, reaction design). This strategy entails the preparation of trifluoromethylheteroatom anions using alkali fluoride 
salts, as a fluorine source, in conjunction with appropriate precursors for each motif. In devising 
this reaction blueprint, certain criteria must be met the precursors should be (i) benchstable, 
(ii) commercially available or easily prepared, and (iii) operating in high atom economy.
