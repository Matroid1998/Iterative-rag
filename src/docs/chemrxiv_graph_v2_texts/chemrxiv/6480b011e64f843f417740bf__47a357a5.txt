Description:
Does not bind carbon dioxide in its neutral form but binds CO2 upon electrochemical reduction to a radical anion or dianion.

Text:
Electrochemically driven carboxylation of reduced quinones has been well documented.16,17 
While neutral anthraquinone does not show carbon dioxide binding, electrochemical reduction 
to form a radical anion (1 electron reduction) or dianion (2 electron reduction) activates this 
molecule to bind CO2 in either an EECC or ECEC (E  electron transfer, C  chemical reaction) 
mechanism (Scheme 1).18 While most early studies used analytical electrochemistry 
techniques to study the carbon dioxide capture of quinones and other redoxactive 
molecules,19,20 more recent work has begun to develop practical devices that can capture 
carbon dioxide in an electrochemically driven process.21
