Description:
Subject to alkylation reactions.

Text:
Phosphate esters have been used successfully as organocatalysts 1, 2, 3 in a plethora of
transformations including, but not limited to Mannich reactions 4, 5, 6, FriedelCrafts
reactions 7, transfer hydrogenations 8, azaDielsAlder reactions 9, Biginelli
reactions 10, PictetSpengler reactions 11, bromoesterifications 12, alkylation of
alphadiazo esters 13 and hydrophosphonylations 14. Powerful asymmetric organocatalysts have been designed selecting bulky asymmetric
organic residues bound to the remaining two oxygen atoms at the phosphorous center

this design using 3,3substituted
BINOL phosphoesters 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
