Description:
Forms a neutral complex with TACN without an acidic OH bond.

of the Ca2 
centre would yield a neutral (TACN)Ca complex without an acidic 
OH bond. Examination of the precedent for modulation of C3
symmetric phenolic TACN ligands, reveals a scarcity of methods 
for selective monofunctionalization, presumably due to the 
selectivity issues associated with stochastic approaches. Noteworthily, synthetic routes have been developed from mono
Nalkylated TACN derivatives yielding pentadentate N,N,N,O,O 
donor ligands.30 We envisaged a conceptually simple alternative 
approach in which K(6benzene)(tBuTACN)Ca (2) is O
alkylated in situ by functionalization of one phenoxide arms 
(Scheme 2). We opted for a methylation strategy given its limited 
Scheme 1. Synthesis and Xray structures of anionic and neutral calcium 
complexes 2 and 3 (ellipsoids set at 50 probability level; H atoms omitted 
and arenes shown in wireframe format for clarity).
