Present Work 
In continuation of our ongoing work for the synthesis of 7Aminomethyl phthalides based 
fluorescent for the study of CysteineSpecific Blue Fluorescence Probe13, we developed a 
novel method for the synthesis of thioether 4 by a onepot reaction by using the commercial 
available, trimethylsilyl iodide as a reagent in acetonitrile under reflux conditions, where it 
undergo multiple functional group changes, varies with mole equivalent of TMSI used in the 
reaction
