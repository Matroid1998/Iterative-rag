Description:
Usually forms octahedrally coordinated metal ions in 2D metal halide perovskites.

Text:
2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are widely investigated for their possible 
applications in several fields ranging from photovoltaics and photodetection to photocatalysis.1
6 From a structural point of view, both RuddlesdenPopper and DionJacobson families, of 
general formula A2An1MnX3n1 and AAn1MnX3n1, respectively (where A and A organic 
cations and n  number of staggered inorganic layers made of metal M and halide X), can be 
seen as composed by inorganic slabs with octahedrally coordinated metal ions (usually Pb), 
separated by ammonium organic ligands coordinated to the halides of the octahedra.1 One of 
the most appealing characteristics of 2D MHPs is their vast chemical (and in turn structural) 
tunability which can be modulated by changing the organic spacer, the central atom, and the 
halide.1 The database of the actually known 2D perovskites can be found in ref.
