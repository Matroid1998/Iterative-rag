Commonly employed as a donor moiety.

Text:
Two of the most common moieties employed as donors and acceptors, respectively, are 
9,9dimethy9,10dihydroacridine (DMAC) and 2,4,6triphenyl1,3,5triazine (TRZ), and 
the combination of the two produces the emitter DMACTRZ, first reported by Tsai et al.7 
DMACTRZ shows a very high photoluminescence quantum yield, PL, of 90, at lPL of
