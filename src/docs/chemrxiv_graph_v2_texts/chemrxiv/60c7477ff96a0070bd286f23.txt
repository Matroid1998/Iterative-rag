. RingOpening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) has become one of the most versatile 
polymerization techniques finding application in many areas of polymer and materials research.1 The 
ROMP of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which is a cheap byproduct in the C5 stream of naphtha crackers, is 
of industrial relevance for the fabrication of e.g. body panels for vehicles or cell covers for chloroalkali 
plants, domestic waste water treatment units and large waste containers.2,3 The thermoset 
poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) is characterized by excellent mechanical properties, i.e. high toughness 
and rigidity, and an outstanding chemical resistance. The latter property is ascribed to an autoxidation of
