Description:
Unactivated arenes can be selectively hydrogenated using a ruthenium-catalyzed process.

Stimulated by this 
challenge, in this article we describe the development of a rutheniumcatalyzed siteselective hydrogenation of 
unactivated arenes by taking advantage of the directing effect (Fig. 1c). Enabled by the DG, unactivated benzene

derivatives can be siteselectively saturated in the presence of conventionally more reactive heterocycles, bicyclic 
arenes, and other easily reducible functional groups, making it attractive for complex analogue synthesis and late
stage functionalization.
