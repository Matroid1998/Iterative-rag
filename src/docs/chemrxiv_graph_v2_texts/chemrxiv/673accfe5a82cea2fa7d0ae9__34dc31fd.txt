Description:
A metal surface used in the catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol.

Text:
CO2 dissociation on Cu surfaces is one such model system that has received extensive
attention due to its relevance in the catalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol.13 This pro
cess has been proposed as one of the strategies to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels, thereby
helping mitigate global warming.4 While extensive research has been conducted on under
standing the interaction of CO2 with Cu surfaces,5,6 a comprehensive understanding of the
mechanism and factors influencing dissociation of CO2 on Cu surfaces is still lacking.
