Description:
A precursor molecule used in the dehalogenation process to form C18.

Text:
Cyclo18carbon (C18), an allcarboatomic molecule formed by 18 sphybridized 
carbon atoms connected in turn, has been widely concerned by many fields such as 
physics, chemistry, and materials science since it was structurally characterized twice 
by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the 
condensed phase in 2019 and 2020, respectively.135 By using atom manipulation on 
bilayer NaCl on Cu(111) at 5 K, the C18 molecule was produced for the first time by 
eliminating carbon monoxides from a cyclocarbon oxide molecule C18(CO)6 in one or 
more steps,1 while the latter was realized by dehalogenation of a bromocyclocarbon 
precursor, C18Br6.2 
The reaction precursors for preparing C18, C18(CO)n (n  6, 4, and 2) and C18Br6, in 
the two pioneering experiments are all planar ring structures with high symmetry, and 
belong to the category of carbonrich molecules in nature.
