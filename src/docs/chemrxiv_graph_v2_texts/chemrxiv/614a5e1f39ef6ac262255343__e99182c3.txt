loying is extensively used to optimize functional properties of
materials for photovoltaics (e.g., CdSexTe1x,2 CsSnxPb1xI3 hy
brid perovskites3), energy storage (e.g., Li6PS5xSexBr argyrodite
solid electrolytes4), ferroelectrics (e.g., ScxAl1xN5), and ther
moelectrics (e.g., PbSexTe1x 6) etc. Unlike ordered and stoichiometric compounds, alloys represent
a continuous compositional space and structural disorder adds to
the complexity. Designing alloys to optimize functional proper
ties in this continuous chemical space while also accounting for
the effects of structural disorder is a formidable task. Empiri
cal approaches have been quite successful for alloy design, es
