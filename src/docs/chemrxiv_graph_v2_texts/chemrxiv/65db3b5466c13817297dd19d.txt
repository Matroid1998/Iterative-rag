Description:
A polymer used in aqueous two-phase systems for liquid-liquid phase separation.

Text:
Liquidliquid phase separation (LLPS) condensates are micrometersized membraneless polymer 
condensates formed by associative or segregative interactions of multiple aqueous polymers, such as 
intrinsically disordered proteins1,2 and polyethylene glycoldextran (PEGdextran) aqueous twophase
