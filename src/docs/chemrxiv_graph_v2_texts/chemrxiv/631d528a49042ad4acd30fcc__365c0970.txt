Description:
Materials with a structure similar to ABX3, favorable for excitonic phenomena.

Text:
Instead, they assemble into layered separated slabs of BX64 octahedra and intercalated MA 
cations with a structure similar to the one found in ABX3 perovskites. The dielectric mismatch 
of organic and inorganic components creates a favorable environment for the formation of 
quantum wells and barriers,10 generating an excellent perovskite for excitonic phenomena.1113 
Like their 3D counterparts, RPPs have easily tunable band gaps,14 can be solutionprocessed,15 
and exhibit high device PCE of 1718 .1617
