Description:
Used as a photoactivatable moiety in photoaffinity probes due to its stability.

Text:
Photoaffinity probes are powerful reagents for studying complex biological interactions. They can be 
used to identify new drug targetsofftarget interactions,14 to uncover the structure and location of 
drug binding sites,5,6 for covalent protein labelling or for selective protein immobilisation.79 
Photoaffinity probes typically consist of a photoactivatable functionality appended to a target
selective ligand. Upon exposure to light, the photoactivatable moiety irreversibly crosslinks to the 
target of interest.10 A variety of chemistries can be used for the photoactivatable moiety, including 
benzophenones (Bpa), diazirines and aryl azides.4,1113 Bpa is frequently used, due to its stability,
