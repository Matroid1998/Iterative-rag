Description:
When positioned in PAHs with boron, it contributes to thermally activated delayed fluorescence with narrow emission FWHM.

Nowadays, the synthesis of BNdoped arenes has 
become one of the most popular topics in organic chemistry and 
material chemistry, and numerous new BNdoped aromatic 
compounds have been synthesized and demonstrated to have 
very 
distinct 
properties 
in 
optoelectronic 
materials.4 
Representative applications of Bdoped polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been demonstrated in organic field
effect transistor (OFETs)5 and organic light emitting diodes 
(OLEDs).6 Particularly, since PAHs decorated by parapositioned 
boron and nitrogen atoms has been reported to show thermally 
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with narrow fullwidth at 
halfmaximum (FWHM) of emission based on efficient HOMO
LUMO separation by the multiple resonance effect in 2016,6a 
BNdoped PAHs have been extensively studied for next
generation OLEDs.
