Description:
Atoms that form long backbones in high molecular weight compounds.

Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) constitute 2090 of submicron particulate 
matter in the atmosphere, where they influence radiative forcing by scattering and absorbing UV 
radiation, and by activating cloud formation.1, 2, 3, 4 Despite this importance, a continued low level 
of scientific understanding places secondary organic aerosols among the least understood 
components of the climate system.5, 6, 7 One key unknown concerns the oligomeric species that 
form from various accretion reactions between atmospheric oxidation products of biogenic volatile 
organic compounds.8, 9, 10 Such high molecular weight compounds are estimated to contribute up 
to three quarters of aerosol organic mass.11, 12 Their long carbon backbones and polar terminal 
functional groups are reminiscent of commercial surfactants, and like biological lipids they contain 
stereogenic carbon atoms from their prochiral and chiral molecular progenitors, such as isoprene, 
apinene, and bcaryophyllene.
