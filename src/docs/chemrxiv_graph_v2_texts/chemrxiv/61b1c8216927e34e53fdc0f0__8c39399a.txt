Description:
Involved in magnetization relaxation mechanisms and not simply correlated with DyX distance and XDyX angle axiality.

Text:
However, studies with various Dy(III) congeners of this family31
33 show that Ueff and Tb are not simply correlated with the DyX 
distance and XDyX angle axiality (where X  donor atom(s)) 
and indicate the importance of magnetization relaxation 
mechanisms.4, 3440 
While similar level of performance for dblock SIMs is yet to 
be achieved, prerequisites for utilization of 3d complexes as 
molecular nanomagnets is wellestablished.3, 41 Magnetic 
anisotropy therein results predominantly from the zero field 
splitting (ZFS) of the ground state of the dn ion systems with S  
.19 The ZFS cannot occur for systems with S  . Hence, slow 
relaxation of magnetization observed therein is ascribed to 
more complex mechanisms, including combined phonon, direct 
a.
