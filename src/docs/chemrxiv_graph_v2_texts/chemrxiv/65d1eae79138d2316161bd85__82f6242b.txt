Description:
A compound that reacted without forming a ring-opened byproduct.

Text:
of a vinyl group in the Ncarboxy leaving group (10) 
resulted in the formation of product 3da (73, 8317 er) and 2vinylbenzoic acid (11, 98) as a side 
product, with no observation of 12. This ruled out the intermediacy of a benzoyloxy radical. In the reaction 
of 13 bearing a cyclopropyl group at C2 of indole, no ring opened product 15 was observed, supporting 
the absence of indolederived radical involvement. Interestingly, incorporation of a 4pentenyl group in 
2naphthol resulted in a dearomatized indolylation product 17 (44, 8812 er), with no 5exotrig 
cyclization product 18 observed. In addition, the reaction of cyclopropyl2naphthol 19 gave 20, without 
the ringopened byproduct 21. These experiments helped clary the absence of C1 radicals from 2
naphthols in the catalytic cycle.
