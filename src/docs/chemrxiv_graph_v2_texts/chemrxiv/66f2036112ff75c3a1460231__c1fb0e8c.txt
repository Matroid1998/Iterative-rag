Description:
Involved in nucleophile-aryl reductive elimination with geometry and size similar to iodine.

Text:
The use of transition 
metals, such as palladium, to mediate CO and CN bonds is now a wellestablished tool in drug 
discovery.1 Although SNAr, a metalfree reaction, is also routinely used to form such bonds, there are 
inherent mechanistic limitations to the scope of this reaction.2 The chemistry of hypervalent iodine is often 
described as metallike and indeed the ligand coupling pathway for arylation with diaryliodonium salts 
bears a striking similarity to nucleophilearyl reductive elimination from palladium(II) (Scheme 1a).35 Both 
the geometry and size of the central atom (Pd and I) are almost identical, though a key difference are the 
frontier orbitals that are used to bond to ligands and participate in the reductive elimination or ligand 
coupling mechanisms (Scheme 1a).
