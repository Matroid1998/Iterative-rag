Carrageenans are sulfated galactans which are extracted from red algae (Ruiter  Rudolph, 
49 
1997). These polysaccharides consist of alternating 1,3linked Dgalactopyranose units 
50 
(Gunit) and 1,4linked Dgalactopyranose units (Dunit). The Dunit may also be present as 
51 
3,6anhydroDgalactopyranose, which is then referred to as DAunit. Both the G unit as well 
52 
as the DDAunit can be sulfated at different positions (Usov, 1998; van de Velde  Ruiter, 
53 
2001). Depending on the structural composition of the polysaccharide, the sulfate content 
54 
usually varies between 22  38  (ww) (Ruiter  Rudolph, 1997). 55 
To describe the chemical structure of carrageenans, Knutsen et al.
