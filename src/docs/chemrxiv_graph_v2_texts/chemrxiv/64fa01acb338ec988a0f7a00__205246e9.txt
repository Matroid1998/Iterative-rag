New insights on the use of rare earth elements on advanced materials engineering for
catalysis and environmental technologies
So, in a review established by Akah, A.21, it is described that rare earth oxides might enhance catalytic
features and avoid the loss of acid sites under the fluid catalytic craking (FCC) unit operation, particularly when
heavy residue with higher metal content is used as feed. Indeed, this review shows the effects of rare earth
materials on the structure, stability, and as well as activity of FCC catalysts. Also, other looks of rare earth
metals was taken within this article.
