Description:
Involved in complementary hydrogen bonding in artificial base pairs.

Text:
The expansion of the genetic alphabet with additional, artificial base pairs is a long standing goal in 
synthetic biology.12 The design of these artificial base pairs mainly relies on complementary hydrogen 
bonding,34 hydrophobic interactions5 or geometric complementarity.67 Expanded genetic systems have 
served as foundation of semi synthetic organisms able to store and retrieve increased information in their 
DNA which in turn could allow the creation of proteins with new properties and structures.810 This 
increased chemical diversity has also been used to develop modified aptamers with improved affinity 
and selectivity.1114 Metal ion coordination has lately emerged as an alternative strategy for the creation 
of UBPs.1527 Such artificial metal base pairs are indeed orthogonal to the natural WatsonCrick base 
pairs, are water soluble, possess a high thermal stability and do not cause perturbation to the canonical 
duplex structures.2829 Moreover, unlike cyclic conjugated analogs which can be photoactivated by 
nearvisible light, metal base pairs do not necessarily absorb ultraviolet light and thus do not produce 
any reactive oxygen species which are highly toxic for DNA and cells.3031 The presence of a metal also 
offers the possibility of constructing novel devices such as metal nanowires or DNAbased logic gates.32
34 Yet, most metal base pairs are incorporated into synthetic oligonucleotides and surprisingly, very little 
is known about their enzymatic formation.1718, 3537 
In this context, we have recently investigated the enzymatic construction of two imidazole containing 
nucleotides (Fig.
