Description:
A light element used in covalent linkages within covalent organic frameworks.

Text:
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are versatile materials employed across a 
diverse array of fields, including gas storage and separation, catalysis, sensing, drug delivery, 
water purification, and energy storage, owing to their inherent characteristics.1 COFs are a 
category of porous polymers characterized by their welldefined channels and periodic 
structures in two or three dimensions, which are established through covalent linkages among 
monomers enriched with light elements such as carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and 
hydrogen (H).
