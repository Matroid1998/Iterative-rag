Description:
Compounds that can be added to sulfonyl chlorides to synthesize narylsulfonamides, though they have attenuated nucleophilicity when electron-poor.

Narylsulfonamides represent an important class of or
ganosulfur compounds, as exemplified by their presence 
among various FDAapproved drugs spanning multiple dis
ease indications.1 This motif is prevalent in drug discovery 
due to its polarity, geometry, hydrogen bonding properties, 
and tunable NH pKa (Figure 1A).2 Classically, Narylsulfona
mides can be synthesized via addition of anilines to sulfonyl 
chlorides; however, this approach is not always conducive 
to synthesis of druglike molecules due to the water sensi
tivity of sulfonyl chloride reagents and attenuated nucleo
philicity of electronpoor anilines. Furthermore, the poten
tial genotoxicity of both anilines and sulfonyl chlorides has 
inspired the development of alternate approaches.3,4 
Despite the recent emergence of numerous catalysts and 
synthetic methods for CN coupling, transition metalcata
lyzed Narylation of primary sulfonamides remains rela
tively underdeveloped.
