Description:
A compound used for the generation of liquid fuels and can be reduced through various methods.

Text:
Indeed, by utilization of existing CO2 for the generation of liquid fuels, the 
carbon footprint could be significantly reduced. Methanol is thereby one of the most promising energy 
vectors, since it could replace liquid fuels in modern technologies.4 
In the past years, several reports based on the reduction of CO2 through various transition metal 
compounds,612 metalfree catalysts1318 or direct reduction with NaBH4 without catalysts19 have been 
published. But it is still a problem to capture the CO2 present in the atmosphere, due to its low 
concentration, and furthermore, to reduce it to obtain fuels under ambient conditions.

Description:
Captured from air and reduced to produce a methanol precursor.

Text:
The first report on 
transition metalfree CO2 capture from air, including the consecutive reduction of the CO2 to produce a 
methanol precursor, which can be easily converted into methanol under ambient conditions, was made 
by the group of Mandal in 2019.20 They reported an imidazolebased mesoionic carbene (Figure 1) 
supported 9BBN adduct, which is able to perform the described conversion, including a thorough 
investigation of the mechanistic pathway.
