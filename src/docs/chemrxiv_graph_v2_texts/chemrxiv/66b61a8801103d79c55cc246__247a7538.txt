Description:
A rare metal used in efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Text:
However, the most efficient and durable electrocatalysts 
currently available for promoting the hydrogen evolution reac
tion (HER) are nanoparticles (NPs) made from expensive rare 
metals, such as platinum (Pt),4,5 which prevents the widespread 
adoption of H2 as an affordable fuel. To shift to a net zero car
bon society, it is indispensable to produce more appropriate 
catalysts with a higher activity than Pt NPbased catalysts. Recently, Lee et al.
