Description:
Reversibly chemisorbs on zerovalent nickel complexes at room temperature.

Text:
In this context, we have reported the 
reversible, recyclable, and pressureresponsive roomtemperaturechemisorption of carbon 
monoxide (CO) on a zerovalent nickel complexes that bear multifunctional multipurpose carbene 
ligands,14 namely Nphosphine oxidesubstituted imidazolinylidenes (SPoxIms) and the 
corresponding imidazolylidenes (PoxIms) (Figure 1B, left).15,16 (S)PoxIm ligands in tetrahedral 
(S)PoxImNi(CO)n complexes selectively adopt either a C (n  3) or C,O (n  2) coordination 
mode, which can be interconverted through the additionexclusion of CO. 
A strategy based on the use of Lewis acids (LAs) is another potential option for reversibly 
modulating the electronicspatial environment around metal centers that bear multifunctional 
ligands (Figure 1A, right). The LAmediated process can cause a substantial change in both the 
electronic state and spatial environment of the metal center due to the change in the number of 
ligands.
