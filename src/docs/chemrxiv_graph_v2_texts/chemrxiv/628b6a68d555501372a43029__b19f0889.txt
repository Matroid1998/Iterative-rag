Forms structures such as the glitter structure with tetragonal hexacarbon C6.

It is relevant to observe interconnectedness between solid state and organic domains regarding the 
chemistry of carbon. Inspired from 2D 1,4cyclohexadiene planar molecule (Fig. 1a) was enclosed 
in the so called glitter structure with tetragonal hexacarbon C6, thus mirroring the molecule in a 
crystal 1. The structure shown in Fig. 1b consists of cornersharing tetrahedra of C(sp3) white 
spheres in the a,b plane, connected by CC double bonds along cdirection. The crystal data 
detailed in Table 1 point to a distorted tetrahedron with angles departing from the perfect 
tetrahedron angle CCC  109.47 found, for instance, in methane CH4 or diamond. Due to the 
two kinds of connectivity (Fig.

Description:
A simple dense allotrope with 3D periodicity.

Text:
1c obtained after geometry optimization onto the ground state with quantum 
mechanical calculations based on the density functional theory DFT 3 is described in the 
tetragonal system (cf. Table 1). However, such tetrahedron was found less cohesive, explained by 
the lack of 3D periodicity. Additional carbon at 0,0,0 (corner positions, Fig. 1d) let gain 3D 
periodicity with cornersharing tetrahedra in all directions. The resulting tetC4 was found as 
cohesive as diamond 4 and equally characterized with unique interatomic distance and angle as 
shown in Table 1. Our proposition of a very simple dense carbon allotrope, i.e.

Description:
Forms allotropes with large stoichiometries such as C16, C24, and C36.

Text:
with four atoms in a bodycentered 
tetragonal unit cell (Z2), knowing that diamond has facecentered cubic unit cell (Z4), is 
challenging in view of the recently predicted carbon allotropes of large stoichiometries (C16, C24 
and C36 57).
