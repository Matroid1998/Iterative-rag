Description:
A metal reductant traditionally used in reductive cross coupling reactions.

Synergistic photoredoxtransition metal catalysis, commonly referred to as metallaphotoredox, has 
emerged as a reliable strategy for designing and developing new transformations under mild conditions.1 
Compared to single catalytic systems, metallaphotoredox catalysis combines the unrivaled capability of 
transition metal catalysis for bond formation with the broad utility of photoinduced electron or energy
transfer processes, which facilitates the success of challenging chemical transformations.2 Among the 
various established metallaphotoredox catalytic systems, the reductive crosscoupling reactions have 
been extensively studied that afford a straightforward and modular approach to access valuable complex 
targets from two readily available electrophiles.3 In contrast to traditional reductive cross coupling 
reactions, this photoredoxassisted reductive strategy not only avoids the use of superstoichiometric metal 
reductants (e.g., Zn, Mn, ZnEt2), but also improves the catalysts performance as well as enables precise 
control over multiple selectivities via modulation of two independent catalytic cycles.
