Description:
Electron-deficient compounds used in Ni-catalyzed CN bond formation.

1B).8 Many subsequent variants followed, and examples refining 
and improving the conditions with,9 or without the use of donating 
ligands are still at the forefront of the catalysis landscape.10, 11 Building 
up on this new mechanistic paradigm, in 2020, Nocera and coworkers 
reported a Nicatalyzed protocol that allowed the formation of CN 
bonds between electrondeficient aryl bromides and amines through a 
proposed NiINiIII redox process, without the need of light or a 
photocatalyst (Fig. 1C). Similar to the photoredox processes, no 
additional ligands on the Ni catalyst were required.12 However, the 
proofofconcept study reported by Nocera and coworkers was 
applied to simple bromoarenes.
