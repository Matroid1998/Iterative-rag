Description:
Can be incorporated into DNA by human DNA polymerases.

Furthermore, experimental evidences had confirmed the side effects after prolonged treatment with 
a high dose of AZT, that AZTmonophosphate could be incorporated into DNA by human DNA 
polymerases  and 8, and that increased reactive oxygen species was a component of the mechanism 
of perinatal carcinogenesis by AZT in mice9. To better manage such side effects, a future better 
understanding of oneelectron oxidation chemistry of thymine on DNA is highly demanded. However, 
the factors in determining the divergent pathways are not yet clear, though two main processes of 
water addition to the thymine radical cation and protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) at methyl 
group were proposed (Scheme 1A) for elucidation of the reaction mechanism at thymine5,6,10. Figure 1.
