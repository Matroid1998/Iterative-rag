Description:
Characterized by their rapid reaction rates with free cysteine residues under mild conditions.

Chemical conjugation based on the maleimidethiol chemistry (1, 2) is still widely used 
to obtain homogeneous and heterogeneous antibodydrug conjugates (ADCs) (3, 4) and 
conjugate vaccines (5, 6). Maleimides are characterized by their rapid reaction rates with free cysteine residues 
under mild conditions (7). The cysteine residue is very attractive for protein conjugation 
due to its low natural abundance and the excellent nucleophilicity of the thiolate anion 
(7). In bioconjugates the reaction between species containing a maleimide and a cysteine 
residue leads to the formation of a fivemembered ring thiosuccinimide linker. The 
identification of the conjugation site by mass spectrometry is very important because it 
informs the linkage position(s) between the antigendrug and the carrier protein and 
shed light on product homogeneity (8, 9).
