Description:
A light element used as a building block in COFs with strong covalent bonds.

Text:
COFs are polymeric porous materials that form extended network structures connected by organic linkers. These materials
enable the integration of organic, lightelement (e.g. C, H, N, B, O) building blocks with strong covalent bondswhich
would typically result in amorphous solidshowever, due to the dynamic covalent chemistry and slower reaction kinetics, one
can obtain 2D or 3D crystalline periodic materials.1,2 In COFs, the faces and edges of their monomer units are exposed to
pores, resulting in high surface area. Their structural, physical, and chemical features include tunable porosity, low density,
high crystallinity, and strong covalent bonds.
