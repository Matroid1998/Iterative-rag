Description:
Mesoporous silica nanorods showed increased uptake for certain aspect ratios.

Text:
Thus, organic nanorods build of 
AIE dyes, coated with PEGlipids showed increased uptake in certain cell lines.8 Nanorodshaped drug crystals 
showed a some increase in the cell uptake compared to spherical one, which improved drug action.9 
Mesoporous silica nanorods showed increased uptake but only for certain aspect ratio (2.12.5), while longer 
nanorods were less efficient.10 Iron oxide nanorods also showed stronger internalization, but the effect was 
limited with only 1.21.4fold enhancement.11 Another interesting aspect is that nanorods may internalize 
differently into different cell lines.

Description:
Forms mesoporous nanorods that show specific uptake into cancer cells.

Text:
In addition to already mentioned reports on nanorods of AIEbased dyes,8 
mesoporous silica nanorods showed some specific uptake into cancer cells.12 Another study suggested that 
rodshape of nanostructures functionalized with antibodies, can improve specificity of uptake to specific cell 
lines.13 
As a general tendency, synthesis of nanorods is easier for inorganic materials than for organic ones. Synthesis 
of soft polymeric nanomaterials of high aspect ratio is particularly challenging and, hence, the studies of their 
biological behavior are rather limited.
