Description:
Used in the construction of BCH skeletons by an intramolecular 2+2 cycloaddition under the irradiation of light.

Attributed to their constrained geometries and 
precisely oriented pendant substituents, these saturated 
polycycles effectively emulate the topological characteris
tics of substituted benzenes, which allows for the preserva
tion of desired interactions with biomacromolecules while 
enhancing the pharmacokinetics, solubility, and metabolic 
stability of drug candidates.12 Recent studies have identi
fied 1,2disubstituted bicyclo2.1.1hexanes as potential bi
oisosteres for orthodisubstituted benzenes with retained 
biological activity validated by in vitro experiments.3c,3h 
Hence, there is an increasing demand for development of ef
ficient strategies for streamlined access to these bicycles.38 
One of most common methods to construct BCH skeleton is 
by an intramolecular 22 cycloaddition of 1,5diene under 
the irradiation of light3.
