Description:
Nickel exhibits a square planar coordination with two apical coordination sites free.

Here, we systematically vary the rate of energy transfer to the sample and monitor how it affects
reaction kinetics. To this aim, we have found a suitable model reaction in the trimerisation of
bis(dibenzoylmethanato) nickel(II) (Ni(dbm)2, Scheme 1).26 In the brown Ni(dbm)2, nickel exhibits a
square planar coordination with two apical coordination sites free. The green trimer, Ni(dbm) 23, is
formed via bridging oxygen atoms resulting in an octahedral coordination around nickel. Having a single
phase as the reactant, trimerisation is independent of mixing, while the trimer is the sole product that,
apparently, forms in a single reaction step.
