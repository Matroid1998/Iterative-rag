Description:
Catalysts based on oxides of transition metals used in alkaline electrolyzers.

Text:
Alkaline elec
trolyzers employ more abundant (and affordable)
catalysts based on oxides of transition metals such
as Ni 8,9. The catalyst development process is based on
so called rational design in which one synthesizes
only materials showing prospective activity in the
oretical and computational prescreening. This pre
screening can be done by computational assessment
of the binding energies of OER surface intermedi
ates on candidate surfaces. Such analysis allows
for determination of the potential limiting reac
tion step, and thereby the theoretical overpoten
tial 1, 10. The method is however crucially de
pendent on the reaction mechanism embedded into
the calculation. Reaction mechanism modelling is
therefore a central part of the computational ap
proach.
