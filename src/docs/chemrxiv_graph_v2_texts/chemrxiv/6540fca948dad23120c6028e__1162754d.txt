Description:
Used to operate a PEM setup for 400 hours at 10 mA cm2, but experiences Mn leaching at higher current densities.

showed that Co3O4 can perform OER over several days in 
strongly acidic electrolytes, albeit at low current densities, using 
a threeelectrode cell.3 In terms of practical applicability, 
MnO2 was used to operate a PEM setup for 400 h at 
10 mA cm2.4 When 100 mA cm2 was applied, the system shut 
down after 8 h, which was attributed to extensive Mn leaching 
and calls for the need to stabilize the noble metalfree OER 
catalyst further. One strategy to achieve higher stabilization is the expansion to 
multinary compositions.
