Application of such coupling using metasurfaces towards
photoelectronic devices is a promising direction of research and
experimentation. Systematic discussion of the relationship be
tween plasmonic and molecular vibrational coupling using meta
surfaces is still required. Control of the optical absorption and
emission of the functional groups (molecular absorberemitter)
based on geometry and properties of metasurfaces needs experi
mental verification and validation. This motivated current study
to investigate the optical properties of several polymeric materi
als such as polyimide (PI), widely used in industry, SU8, which
is popular in micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) as an
