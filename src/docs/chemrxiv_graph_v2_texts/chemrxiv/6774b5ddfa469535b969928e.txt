Description:
Vacancies on MoMoSVn induce the formation of a built-in electric field that facilitates the HER process.

As for undercoordinated catalysis, atoms at terrace edges or facets 
contribute approximately 70  of the total catalytic activity of a medium 9. In addition, Huang et al 
reported that edge undercoordination sites possess a lower activation barrier for hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER), and possess a turnover frequency (TOF) that is two to four orders of magnitude higher 
10. Li et al 11 reported that the formation of vacancies on the TiO2aTiO2 sample achieves a higher 
NH3 production rate of 10.7 nmol cm2 h1 in photoelectrochemical N2 reduction. Similarly, Gong et al 
12, reported that sulfur vacancies on MoMoSVn can induce the formation of a builtin electric field 
(BIEF). The moderate BIEF facilitates the HER process by lowering the MoH bond energy 13.
