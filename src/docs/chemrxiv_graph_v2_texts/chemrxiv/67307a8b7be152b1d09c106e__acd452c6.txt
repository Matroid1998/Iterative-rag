Description:
Part of carbon-fluorine bonds in sp3 CF3 or sp2 CF2H groups.

Text:
In the past few years, 
Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLPs) catalysts based on group 13 compounds have been applied to highly 
selective catalytic transformations that allow the controlled functionalisation of a single carbon
fluorine bond of sp3 CF3 or sp2 CF2H groups.1318
