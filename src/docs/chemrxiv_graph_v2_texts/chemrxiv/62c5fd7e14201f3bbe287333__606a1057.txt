Description:
CBG is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Recent studies have 
shown that CBG interacts weakly with the cannabinoid 
receptors (CBR1 and CBR2),7,8is the most potent ligand of 
transient 
receptor 
potential 
(TRPV1) 
among 
the 
phytocannabinoids,9 and can also activate 2 adrenoceptor 
(2AR).10 Recently it has been found that CBG 
administration in C57BL6J male mice can reduce blood 
pressure through 2AR mechanism.11 However, unlike 
CBD or THC, CBG exhibits a unique interaction with 5
hydroxytryptamine (5HT1A), associated with neuronal 
firing and release of neurotransmitter.12 Moreover, CBG is 
known to exhibit antipain properties without any 
psychotropic side effects.13 In humans, CBG proved effective 
in human inflammatory bowel diseases5 and, similar to 
eicosanoid  epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), CBG reduces 
the eye pressure in glaucoma.14 CBG is neuroprotective in 
Huntingtons disease and is effective against methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA.15,16 Overall, there is 
potential that CBG will maintain the homeostasis in the 
body when the endocannabinoid system is disrupted in 
different diseases states.13 
Structurally, CBG is monocyclic, containing linear prenyl 
chain, and is unique among pCBs which are polycyclic, as 
exemplified with 9THC and CBD (Figure 1).
