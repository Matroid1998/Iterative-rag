Description:
Porous materials investigated as adsorbents for paraffin-olefin separation.

Text:
The energy requirements 
of this process are so high that paraffinolefin separation alone accounts for 0.3 of global energy 
consumption.3,4 One promising alternative to thermallydriven separations are adsorptionbased 
separations, which are much less energyintensive because they do not rely on a thermallydriven 
phase change.5 Many porous materials have been investigated as adsorbents for paraffinolefin 
separation such as zeolites,6,7 carbonaceous materials,8,9 and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs),10
12 with MOFs showing great promise in particular.
