An endocrine disruptor known to be particularly toxic to many ecosystems.

Additionally, bisphenolA is known to 
be an endocrine disruptor, and is now well recognized as 
being particularly toxic to many ecosystems, thus 
highlighting the importance of studying its degradation.3 
Understanding the degradation of this polymer and its 
associated products, as well as the development of suitable 
and effective recycling routes, therefore seems inevitable if 
we are to contain its negative impact on the environment. Examples of PBPAC degradation studies are numerous in 
the literature, starting with hydrolysis and methanolysis, with 
complete depolymerization or yields in excess of 80 , 
analyzed mainly by infrared spectroscopy and gas 
chromography.46 Other studies have focused on the 
biodegradation of polycarbonates, but this time with highly 
variable yields.
