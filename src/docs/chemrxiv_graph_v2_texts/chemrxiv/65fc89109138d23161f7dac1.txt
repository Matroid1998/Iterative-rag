Description:
Organic compounds found in OSPWs that contribute to water toxicity.

For wastewaters comprising complex mixtures of COPCs such as OSPW, current guidelines recommend 
57 
whole effluent toxicity (WET) as the basis for discharge criteria for the protection of aquatic life;8 WET 
58 
has also been a focus of regulatory policy development for treated OSPW release.3 OSPWs are 
59 
contaminated by both organic (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons, such as polycyclic aromatics, PAHs; 
60 
naphthenic acid fraction components, NAFCs) and inorganic (e.g., trace elements, suspended solids) 
61 
COPCs, and it remains unclear the extent to which they contribute additively or interactively to the 
62 
waters toxicity. To develop mechanistic understanding, it is therefore important that candidate OSPW 
63 
treatment solutions be evaluated not only for WET endpoints, but also for their treatment performance 
64 
toward multiple COPCs.
