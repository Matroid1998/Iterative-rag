Description:
A pyrimidine base found in DNA and RNA.

One of the fundamental questions on the origins of life lies in the current style of the
genetic code seen on Earth. DNA and RNA adopted nucleobases, which are the build
ing blocks of nucleic acids, as the unit of the code, ATCG for DNA and AUCG for RNA. The structures are categorized into two kinds of molecules pyrimidine bases, including
cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U) and purine bases, including guanine (G), and
adenine (A). A pyrimidine base, a simple ring structure, is bounded by hydrogen bonds to
a purine base, a fusedring structure to form a complementary pair and deliver the genetic
information in DNA and RNA.
