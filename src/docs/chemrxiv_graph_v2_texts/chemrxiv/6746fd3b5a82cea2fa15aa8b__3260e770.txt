Description:
Compounds that participate in 32cycloaddition reactions with DACs to form cyclic compounds.

Text:
DACs are often regarded as synthons for 1,3
zwitterionic intermediates, which undergo cycloaddition and 
annulation reactions (Schemes 1, (2) and (3)). Indeed, the capacity 
of DACs to engage in cycloadditions provides access to a diverse 
range of carbocyclic and heterocyclic structures. 1,9,14,16,17,21
25. The rearrangement of DACs leads to the formation of 
unsaturated fivemembered heterocycles, thus providing a metal
free approach to connected heterocyclic structures (Schemes 1, (2) 
and (3)). This paper focuses on the 32cycloaddition reaction of 
DACs with aldehydes, which provides a wide range of cyclic 
compounds depending on the Lewis acid used.

Results and discussion 
It is known that the reaction of DACs with aldehydes 
under the action of anhydrous GaCl3 is an interesting method for 
the formation of substituted indenes and polycyclic lactones 
2627. Recently we have discovered a novel TaCl5mediated 
transformation of DACs in the presence of two equivalents of
