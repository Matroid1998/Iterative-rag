Description:
A highly reactive oxidizer in its excited state, interacting with nearby molecules.

Photoexcitation of UO22 
populates a highly reactive excited state where it behaves as a strong oxidizer4, leading to a 
variety of interactions with nearby molecules and providing alternative pathways for electronic 
relaxation. The quenching of UO22 luminescence by some ions such as carbonate and chloride is 
efficient enough that even at low concentrations, they can make it difficult to determine uranyl 
concentrations in solution. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was used to understand the 
quenching mechanism of chloride and bromide. It was found that the halogen anions interacted 
with UO22 through the equatorial plane and the uranyl solvent shell influenced the anions 
ability to quench the luminescence 5.
