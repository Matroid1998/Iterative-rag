Description:
A material with exceptional electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.

Text:
There is a tremendous interest in graphene and graphenebased materials triggered by their
exceptional electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.1 Graphene oxide (GO), an oxi
dized form of graphene, is one of these materials. The fact that the properties of GO can
be tuned by modifying its structure, in terms of the types, ratio, and spatial arrangement
of functional groups, opens the door for rational design for a wide spectrum of potential ap
plications, e.g., water remediation, energyharvesting and storing devices, electrocatalysis,
gas separation, and protonconducting membranes in fuel cells.29
The growing number of studies on the structure of and processes at the GOwater inter
face underlines the importance of understanding the interactions between GO and interfacial
water.
