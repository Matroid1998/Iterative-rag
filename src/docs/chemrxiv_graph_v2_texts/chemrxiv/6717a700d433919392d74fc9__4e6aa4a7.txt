Description:
Used to activate carbon acids via proton transfer for photocatalytic reactions.

Text:
Redoxneutral reactions can be accomplished 
under modified conditions by employing a suitable 
stoichiometric reductant as a coadditive, generating 
unnecessary waste byproducts,7b, 11 or through radical chain 
mechanisms using applicable initiators that often show 
severe limitations in substrate generality.6i, 12 While useful, 
these activation methods preclude the application of carbon 
acidderived radicals in the variety of multicatalytic methods 
available today. Recently, reports on photocatalytic activation of carbon 
acids using strong base catalysts have been detailed by 
Kobayashi13 
and 
Cannon14 
to 
effect 
redoxneutral 
hydroalkylation reactions. Each of these methods employed 
potassium tertbutoxide to activate the carbon acids via 
proton transfer, then enter the radical realm through 
photoinduced electron transfer (PET).
