Description:
Polar functional groups preferred in CC bond cleavage methods.

Text:
Although enormous progress has been achieved in recent decades, 
the current methods for the cleavage of CC bonds primarily rely on transitionmetalcatalyst and 
Substrates that possess a high degree of ring strain andor feature polar functional groups, such as 
carbonyls, nitriles, and imines are preferred. Conversely, the cleavage of unstrained and nonpolar 
CC bonds is still in its early stages of development6. In particular, cases of catalytic approaches 
to realize C(sp2)C(sp3) bond activation have been rare7. Jiao et al. developed oxidative reactions 
to scissor C(sp2)C(sp3) bonds using 2,3dichloro5,6dicyano1,4benzoquinone (DDQ) as the 
oxidant, demonstrating the feasibility of selective cleavage of nonpolar unstrained CC bonds, 
despite the arguably drawbacks of DDQs toxicity, high cost, and difficulty in the removal of 
DDQH2 waste8.
