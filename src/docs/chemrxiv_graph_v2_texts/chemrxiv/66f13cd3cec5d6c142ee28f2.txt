Description:
Molecules that can be inserted into metalamine bonds to enhance adsorption capabilities in metalorganic frameworks.

explored the use of diamine
appended metalorganic frameworks as CO2 adsorbents in gas 
separation, showcasing the insertion of CO2 molecules into 
metalamine bonds, thereby enhancing the materials adsorption 
capabilities.7 
Another intriguing approach to gas storage in MOFs is the 
strategy presented in this study, focusing on MOFs with narrow 
pore apertures smaller than the size of the gas guest. In this 
process, the gas guest is introduced into the pores under specific 
loading conditions and is not released immediately under 
ambient conditions.
