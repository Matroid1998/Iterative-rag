Description:
An amphiphilic probe and pharmacophore.

To function within a membrane or cell, small molecules need to be actively or passively 
36 
transported into or across biological membranes. The physicochemical properties allowing for 
37 
both membrane permeability and aqueous solubility are thought to be tightly confined.13 Strikingly, 
38 
nature and medicinal chemistry vary in their approaches for the synthetic design of highly bioactive 
39 
molecules (Figure 1). With a few notable exceptions of amphiphilic probes and pharmacophores, 
40 
including fingolimod (FTY720),4 eliglustat,5 palmostatin B,6 salmeterol,7 and orlistat,8 synthetic 
41 
small molecule probes and pharmacophores rarely exhibit lipid tails. Natural products, on the other 
42 
hand commonly exhibit lipid functionalizations that finetune their pharmacokinetic andor 
43 
pharmacodynamic properties. Well known examples include bryostatin,9,10 thapsigargin11, 
44 
daptomycin,12 and phorbol ester13.
