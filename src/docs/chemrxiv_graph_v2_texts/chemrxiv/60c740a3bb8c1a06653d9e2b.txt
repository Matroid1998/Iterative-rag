Description:
Used as a feedstock in catalytic processes.

. Heterogeneous catalysis is an 
integral component of many industrial processes 
that manufacture food, materials, and energy for a 
high quality of life1. Catalytic surfaces, pores, and 
singleatom sites are responsible for accelerating 
the rates of reactions that protect and provide the 
most important resources including fuels2, 
fertilizers3, medicines4, basic chemicals5,6, CO2 
feedstock7, clean air8, and polymers9,10 that 
would be inaccessible absent catalytic acceleration. In the past century, enhancement of these processes 
has progressed via increased catalyst selectivity and 
stability along with increased overall activity for 
smaller reactors that operate at higher efficiency 
and lower temperature11. Catalytic rate enhancement occurs primarily 
through catalyst design to tune the binding 
characteristics of surface species and transition 
states 
for 
maximum 
catalytic 
turnover
