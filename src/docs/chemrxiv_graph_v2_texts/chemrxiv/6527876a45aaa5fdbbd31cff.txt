Description:
A matrix used to generate and evaluate radical species through ballmilling tests.

Moreover, the effect of coupling reactions between the 
generated radicals, which cannot be neglected in solution, can 
be suppressed by the rigid polymer matrix, allowing unexplored 
fluorescent radicals to be discovered and investigated systemat
ically. The purpose of this study is to 1) establish the concept of 
using mechanochemical reactions of polymer chains as a useful 
tool to generate and characterize metastable fluorescent radicals 
in the bulk, and to 2) clarify the luminescence properties of 
DAAN radicals by combining experimental and computational 
chemistry. For this purpose, twenty different DAAN derivatives 
were prepared as fluorescent radical precursors, and the radical 
species generated in the polystyrene matrix by ballmilling tests 
were systematically evaluated using solidstate fluorescence 
spectroscopy, electronparamagneticresonance (EPR) meas
urements, and densityfunctionaltheory (DFT) calculations.
