Description:
C(sp3)rich compounds that enhance structural diversity in chemical libraries.

Text:
A strategy that combines the diversity of a general PBM reaction with alkyl boronic coupling 
partners exponentially increases the accessibility of C(sp3)rich alkyl amines (Figure 1C, mnp 
hypothetical products in a 3D library). Such a method would enable holistic structural diversity 
coverage for complex aliphatic amines that could facilitate the comprehensive SAR probing and 
the development of drug candidates13. Despite some recent advance of PBM reaction with alkyl 
boronates have been achieved through radical addition process, where stabilized imine 
intermediate is often required11, a more general alkyl Petasis boronMannich (APBM) reaction is 
highly desirable.
