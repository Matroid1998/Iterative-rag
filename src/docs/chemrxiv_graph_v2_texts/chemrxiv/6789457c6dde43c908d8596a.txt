Description:
Forms covalent bonds with lower bond dissociation energy than second period atoms.

Text:
Covalent bonds between sulfur atoms exhibit lower bond 
dissociation energy than those between atoms of the 
second period, bonds that current commodity polymers 
are typically constructed of.1 Hereby such SS bond 
containing polymers address current sustainability 
challenges plastics face as they can exhibit enhanced 
degradability as well as chemical and mechanical 
recyclability.24 Furthermore, the reversible opening and 
closing of the sulfursulfur bond introduces the potential 
for selfhealing or stimuli responsive behaviour while the 
electronic nature of the sulfur centres bestow these 
materials with unique properties such as the ability for 
transition metal coordination and increased refractive 
indices.511 The controlled incorporation of sulfursulfur 
moieties remains however challenging particularly when 
it comes to linear polymers and often involves the 
employment of synthetically nontrivial building blocks 
that require elaborate synthesis.12,13
