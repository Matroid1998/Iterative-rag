Description:
A spin isomer of hydrogen used in hyperpolarization methods like parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP).

Text:
One example of such a hyperpolarization 
method is parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) in 
which hydrogen gas enriched in the para spin isomer is 
chemically reacted with an unsaturated molecule to 
generate a product with hyperpolarized 1H nuclear spins16
25. In a second step, the hyperpolarization can be 
transferred to other nuclei, e.g. 13C or 15N 2532. PHIP is 
renowned for being inexpensive, simple to use, and allows 
for the production of hyperpolarized substrates with a high 
repetition cycle. For a number of reasons, 1H would be the ideal nucleus for 
hyperpolarizationenhanced MRI3335
