In recent years, chemists have been captivated by the concept of escaping from 
flatland1,2. The utilization of C(sp3)rich threedimensional (3D) scaffolds as bioisosteres 
for planar aromatic ring structures has provided practical solutions to various 
developability challenges encountered in drug discovery3,4. This bioisosteric substitution 
often leads to enhanced potency, solubility, and metabolic stability58. In this context, the 
invention and synthesis of benzene bioisosteres have been actively explored in organic 
synthesis4,9, primarily due to the widespread use of benzene in a vast array of bioactive 
compounds (Fig. 1a)10. Through these efforts, a diverse range of bicyclic or polycyclic 
hydrocarbon scaffolds has been synthesized5,7,11, enabling the precise mimic of ortho1218, 
meta1925, and paradisubstituted benzenes2632.

Description:
A common six-membered aromatic compound.

In sharp contrast, the bioisosteres of pyridine, the second most common aromatic ring 
appearing in drugs10,33, have received less attention and surprisingly encountered trivial 
success. A notable example was recently disclosed by Mykhailiuk, wherein a novel type of 
3azabicyclo3.1.1heptanes was synthesized through the reduction of spirocyclic 
oxetanyl nitrile. The resulting fragment was proposed to mimic 3,5disubstituted 
pyridines (Fig. 1a)34. As the most common sixmembered aromatics, pyridine and benzene should, in principle, 
share a similar strategy for 3D bioisosterism. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that 
the basicity of the sp2N in pyridine plays a vital role in ligandprotein recognition35. The 
complete saturation of pyridine would alter the hybridization of the nitrogen atom
