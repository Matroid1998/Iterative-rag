Description:
Serve as substrates for nitrene insertions to form aziridines.

Text:
Chief among these are aziridines, resulting from nitrene insertions into alkenes, 
which are wellknown for their frequent occurrence in natural products and bioactive molecules, as well as their 
synthetic utility.3,4 The reactivity of these smallest Nheterocycles is mainly attributed to their strained nature that 
leads to a high propensity to undergo ringopening and ringexpansion processes, often with excellent regiocontrol 
and stereochemical integrity of the newly created stereogenic center(s).37 Therefore, aziridines are exceptionally 
versatile and efficient intermediates for olefin difunctionalization, as well as the construction of higher order 
heterocyclic scaffolds that feature prominently among medicinal chemists most desirable synthetic targets.819 
 Due to the potential of alkene aziridination to introduce structural and stereochemical complexity from feedstock 
starting materials, the development of enantioselective aziridination strategies via NT is of key importance in 
organic synthesis.

Description:
Substrates involved in intramolecular aziridination catalyzed by chiral dirhodium complexes.

Text:
In 2003, Che developed a chiral dirhodium complex to catalyze intramolecular aziridination of 
alkenes with sulfonamides and carbamates in up to 76 ee.25 Dauban later used a copperBOX complex to afford 
the intramolecular aziridination of sulfamates in up to 84 ee, although substrates bearing unconjugated or terminal 
olefins gave less satisfactory results.26 In 2017, Zhang used an alternative strategy to iminoiodinanebased nitrene 
formation, reporting enantioselective aziridinations with allyl azidoformates via a radical pathway catalyzed by a 
cobaltporphyrin complex.27 This catalyst gave excellent enantioselectivity when substrates containing (E)olefins
