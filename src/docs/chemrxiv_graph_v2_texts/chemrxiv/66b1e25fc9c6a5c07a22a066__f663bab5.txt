Description:
Electronically unsaturated carbon species capable of forming multiple covalent bonds at the carbon center in a single step.

of four substituents into a given carbon center represents a central issue in 
organic chemistry. Traditionally, this has been achieved via stepwise substitution andor addition 
reactions at the carbon center; however, despite its reliability, this method often lacks efficiency. The overall efficiency of introducing four substituents at the carbon center can be dramatically 
enhanced by using electronically unsaturated carbon species such as carbenes4,5 and carbynes.6
14 Depending on their degree of unsaturation, these species can form multiple covalent bonds at 
the carbon center in a single step.
