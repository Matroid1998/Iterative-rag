Description:
A drug that lowers HGA levels by reversibly inhibiting the enzyme 4hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.

Text:
Ochronosis stiffens cartilage and leads to a
highly debilitating osteoarthropathy, especially of weightbearing joints5, where patients
have little recourse apart from palliative analgesia and complete surgical replacement. The promising new drug nitisinone lowers HGA levels by reversibly inhibiting the HGA
producing enzyme (4hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)6. While nitisinone
treatment can arrest ochronosis7, it cannot reverse8 it. Moreover, the FDA considers HGA
elevation a biomarker but not a cause of ochronosis in AKU9, with the result that nitisinone
is thus far not approved for patients in the US. Therefore, there is a need to conclusively
establish a link from HGA elevation to the cartilage degradation seen in ochronosis. Solidstate NMR (ssNMR) enables structural characterization of pigmented tissue biopsies.
