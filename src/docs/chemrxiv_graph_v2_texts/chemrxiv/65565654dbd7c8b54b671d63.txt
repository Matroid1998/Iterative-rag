630,000 people dying 
from AIDS related illnesses; most cases are localized in selected re
gions of eastern and southern Africa.4 Several treatments have been 
developed that minimize the frequency of medication (i.e., associ
ated with pills or injections) thereby reducing risk to the patient.5 In 
2021, the FDA approved Cabenuva, the first of its kind as an ex
tended release HIV treatment requiring only 1 dose every 1 to 2 
months (via injection) of a suspension containing both cabotegravir 
and rilpivirine.6 A year later, the FDA approved Gileads lenacapavir 
(Scheme 1), sold as Sunlenca. Lenacapavir is a potent twodose 
treatment given only once a year for HIV1 positive patients, found 
to be up to 83 effective in patient improvement.
