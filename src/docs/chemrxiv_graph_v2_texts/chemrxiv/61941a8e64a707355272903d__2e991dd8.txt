Description:
A feedstock chemical with highly available pure enantiomers.

Text:
One could foresee installation of this fragment from an 
(S)glycidol derivative, and not surprisingly many of the 
current pretomanid routes make use of functionalized 
glycidols.2 
Glycidyl pivalate appears to be a particularly important 
variant.3 Enantiomers of optically active glycidol are of 
considerable expense, however, construction from less 
expensive precursors would be desirable. Epichlorohydrin 
is a feedstock chemical, and its pure enantiomers are highly 
available in comparison to those of glycidol. As a result, 
(R)epichlorohydrin is approximately 56 of the cost4 of 
(S)glycidol and could thus form the basis for a more cost
effective route to this intermediate. Figure 1 Pretomanid retrosynthesis from protected glycidols.

Description:
Reacts with carboxylates to form glycidyl esters used in alkyd resins, paints, and coatings.

Text:
Numerous reports describe reaction of epichlorohydrin with 
carboxylates, particularly hindered carboxylates, as the 
ensuing glycidyl esters are used in alkyd resins, paints, 
coatings, and acrylate monomer compositions.5 Fewer 
reports detail the reaction of enantiopure epichlorohydrin 
with carboxylic acid derivatives.5ik This work describes 
development of a practical route to (S)glycidyl pivalate 
from lowcost and readily available (R)epichlorohydrin and 
pivalic acid.
