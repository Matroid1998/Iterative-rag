Description:
A model catalyst system used for studying CO adsorption and surface O-vacancy formation.

Text:
These 
aspects are topic of the present study, where we investigated Ovacancy formation and their 
impact on the CO adsorption characteristics on RuZrO2(111) model catalysts. . Recently, we had investigated the CO2 methanation reaction on a RuZrO2 catalyst in a 
combined experimental and theoretical approach, including also extensive density functional 
theory (DFT) based calculations on a RuZrO2(111) model catalyst system.20;21 In that work we 
had demonstrated that the formation of surface Ovacancies can by enhanced and stabilized by
