Description:
Used in catalysts, though its reduction can lead to reduced catalytic activity.

Text:
of Cu and Re along
with the reduction of Pt in the catalysts gives
rise to reduced relative cost but also to reduced
catalytic activity. Each subcluster in the perfor
mance space can be linearly fitted (illustrated by
the solid green line in Fig. 2) and corresponds to a
subcluster in the design space where compositions
change smoothly in this local region, ensuring a
continuous Pareto front. It is interesting to compare these results
with singleobjective BO as the hitherto preva
lent approach for optimizing HEA compositions. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023d563d ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000208625289 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
