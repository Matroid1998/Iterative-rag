Description:
A component of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that may enhance antibiotic resistance.

However, external hostinduced factors, notably low
oxygen levels, altered pH conditions and exposure to
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) may result in enhanced antibiotic
resistance to INH and TAC. Hydrazones have attracted significant attention
due to their potential to remove free radicals,
which have been identified as primary contribu
tors to various pathological conditions stemming
from oxidative stress such as Alzheimers disease,
cancer and tuberculosis. Numerous studies have
explored
differences
in
the
structurallydifferent
hydrazones derived from the coupling of benzoic and
phenolic acids hydrazides and aromatic aldehydes
with various hydroxyl group substituents. These
compounds feature highlyconjugated systems en
hanced by the presence of hydroxyl groups, which
allows it to resemble the properties of well known
natural antioxidants such as chalcones and stilbenes.
