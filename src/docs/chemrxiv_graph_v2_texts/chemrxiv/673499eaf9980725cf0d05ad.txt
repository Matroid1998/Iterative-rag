Description:
Used in reversed-phase separation when functionalized with hydrophobic ligands for its well-studied separation mechanisms and robustness.

Therefore, liquid 
chromatography (LC) is coupled with MS detection to facilitate the separation of isomers and decrease the strong ion 
suppression originating from the multitude of coeluting compounds3,4. To date, most LCESIMS experiments in discovery lipidomics used analyticalbore column dimension with 2.1 mm 
internal diameter (ID) and up to 150 mm length at 200500 Lmin flow rates. Reversedphase (RP) separation using fully 
or superficially porous silica functionalized with hydrophobic ligands (C4 to C30) remains a method of choice due to the 
wellstudied separation mechanisms and overall robustness of the technique3,5. Recently, several groups demonstrated that 
nanoscale LC coupling with nanoelectrospray ionization (nLCNSIMS), widely utilized in protein biomarker research, 
may also be a valuable analytical configuration for lipidomic studies.
