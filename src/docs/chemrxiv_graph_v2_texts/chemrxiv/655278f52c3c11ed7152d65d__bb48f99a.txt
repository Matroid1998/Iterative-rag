Description:
Tetrahedra that replace some SiO4 in zeolites, requiring charge compensation.

Text:
Aluminosilicates are industrially indispensable materials with a farreaching global 
commercial importance. Besides their more mundane use in construction materials and 
ceramics, their porous forms, most notably zeolites,1 represent the backbone of industrial 
heterogeneous acid catalysis. Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate 
networks where some of the SiO4 tetrahedra are replaced by AlO4, necessitating 
charge compensation by a loosely bound cation in the pore space. Protonation gives rise 
to wellunderstood intraframework Brnsted acid sites of the Si(2OH)Al type,2 which 
were in the past believed to be responsible for all the catalytic properties of these 
materials.

Description:
A highly symmetric species observed using 27Al MAS NMR techniques with relatively narrow line shapes.

Text:
Evidence for a synergistic interaction between 
the Brnsted and the Lewis acid sites has also been presented.6 

Direct characterization of the Lewis acid sites is challenging due to their extremely 
low volumetric abundance (nearsurface species) and the high spin of the 27Al nucleus 
(I  52), giving rise to a considerable quadrupolar moment which, in turn, interacts with 
the electric field gradient (EFG) to produce potentially very broad and complex line 
shapes.7 Although simple onedimensional (1D) 27Al MAS NMR techniques are routinely 
used to observe highly symmetric species (e.g., AlO4 or AlO6), which exhibit relatively 
narrow line shapes, other species of lower symmetry can result in resonances spanning
