Description:
A type of polycarbonate with low room temperature ionic conductivity and poor oxidative stability.

Polycarbonates such as polyethylene carbonate have been explored, but still suffer from low room 
temperature ionic conductivity and poor oxidative stability.2022 
Recently, we synthesized a new class of fluorinatedether smallmoleculeelectrolytes that show high ionic 
conductivity and high oxidative stability.2325 This finding prompted us to explore solid perfluoropolyether 
(PFPE) as a polymer electrolyte. While polycarbonates have been extensively studied,2022,26 there has been 
limited work on solid PFPE.18,27 Previous work27 has shown that crosslinked PFPE can support ion 
transport, albeit still with low conductivities (105 Scm). And previous solution state work done by some 
of us23 and Balsara and coworkers28,29 have shown higher lithium transference number in the perfluoroether 
backbone indicating weaker lithium coordination of the polymer backbone compared to the traditional PEG.
