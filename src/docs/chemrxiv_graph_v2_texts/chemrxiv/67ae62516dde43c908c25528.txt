The global roadmap towards net zero emissions 1, targeting full carbon neutrality by 2050, has significantly 
accelerated the development and adoption of lightweight materials in various engineering applications for 
achieving sustainability goals 2, 3. Among these, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite has 
emerged as a promising material, due to its superior specific strength, stiffness, corrosion resistance, lower 
thermal expansion and design flexibility compared to traditional metallic materials 4, 5. These characteristics 
make CFRP an ideal candidate for demanding applications that require strong yet lightweight structures, 
especially in industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and energy 6. There are four main stages in the CFRP manufacturing cycle part generation, curingconsolidation, machining 
and assemblyjoining 7. Although some CFRP parts can be manufactured into nearnetshape in the initial 
stage (e.g.

Description:
An element that forms abrasive fibres, impacting tool wear and machining efficiency.

Text:
Rapid tool wear due to the abrasive nature of carbon fibres, leading to deteriorated surface quality, 
decreased machining efficiency and increased costs 26 
III. Lack of efficient and automated defects inspection  recognition and process optimization 
technologies 27 
To address these challenges, physicsbased methods (including both analytical models 2831 and numerical 
models 22, 32, 33) have been developed to analyse, understand and predict CFRP machining behaviours. However, CFRP machining remains highly complex, involving dynamic material removal behaviour under 
thermomechanical coupling, high strain rates, and process uncertainty 34. Analytical models, while 
computationally efficient, often rely on oversimplified assumptions (e.g. uniform material properties and 
idealized boundary conditions 29), which limit their prediction accuracy.
