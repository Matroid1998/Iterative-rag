Description:
A transition metal involved in catalytic processes and known for forming complexes with agostic interactions.

The proper conception of the molecular mechanism involving transition metals in the context of 
catalytic processes is of foremost importance. In this regard, the intramolecular threecenter two
electron (3c2e) agostic interaction has gained much attention.14 In 1974, the agostic 
interaction was first identified in a molybdenum complex synthesized by Cotton et al.5 Since 
then, this 3c2e type interaction has attracted significant attention because of its unique nature. Scientists have observed its impact on varied chemical reactions, e.g., oxidative addition of 
alkanes,6 CH bond elimination,7 transcyclometallation,8 cyclometallation,9 ZieglerNatta 
polymerization,10,11 and so on.
