Description:
Abundant in sea life lipids and prone to oxidation.

Fish and seafood processing leftovers are widely 
recognized as a potential source of large amounts of 
different valued biomolecules and biomaterials.1 Fish 
processing increases the stability and quality of products, 
removing parts, such as the viscera containing bacteria and 
enzymes that would otherwise quickly deteriorate proteins 
besides easing oxidation of the omega3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PUFAs) abundant in sea life lipids. In 2011 
more than 70 of the total fish caught was reported to 
subjected to processing before reaching the marketplace, 
with fish industry byproducts accounting up to 75 of the 
catch (depending on postfishing and industrial processing 
processes) and on average 50 in weight.2 Since then, the 
share of processed fish has increased due to further 
economic development of numerous countries.

Description:
Essential fatty acids found in fish oil, contributing to overfishing due to their use in food supplements.

Text:
A few bioeconomy companies have lately started 
production of valued bioproducts from fisheries by
products, especially of fish oil and fish proteins for the 
petfood industry.6 The shift from fish and krill to fish 
processing waste is particularly urgent in the case of fish 
oil production.7 Rich in omega3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, indeed, the extraction of fish oil for the production of 
omega3 food supplements contributes to overfishing 
across the world.8 
Amid the new, low energy circular economy processes to 
recover valued bioproducts, the extraction of a whole fish 
oil named AnchoisOil (AnO) from Mediterranean 
anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fillet leftovers using the 
biobased solvent dlimonene was first reported in 2019.9 
Limonene indeed is an excellent solvent for lipids, but 
contrary to many oilderived solvents it provides several 
health benefits being edible and widely used in the 
nutraceutical industry.10 
The process is entirely circular and wastefree because 
after the extraction of the oil, the biobased solvent derived 
from orange and lemon peels prior to fruit squeeze and 
juice production is nearly entirely recovered, whereas the 
anchovy residue (AnR) is an exceptional organic fertilizer 
dubbed AnchoisFert (AnF).11 
Named LimoFish (LiF),12 and conducted under ultra
mild conditions (ambient temperature and pressure), the 
new extraction process has significant practical relevance 
because it closes the fishing material cycle for the worlds 
most fished species (anchovy)8,9 using a solvent that 
prevents microbial spoilage due to its powerful 
antimicrobial activity.10
