metasur
faces have been utilized as highly efficient lightabsorbing ma
terials, i.e., as a new platform for photothermal energy conver
sion116. In particular, this new method to engineer materials is
attracting attention to realise radiative cooling, radiation sources
and detectors at the midinfrared (mIR) wavelengths range. Met
als such as gold, silver, copper, and aluminum have been used for
engineering metasurfaces and for conventional nanofabricaiton
of singleparticle plasmon resonance nanoparticles. However,
these materials have a considerably large time constant of free
electron oscillation, i.e. the resonance between the metalbase
plate of MIM and nanomicrostructures persists for a long time. As a result, there is low reflection, but also a nonnegligible com
ponent of reradiated power as scattering.
