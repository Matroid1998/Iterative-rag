Some
recent efforts focused on defect modeling in alloys and disor
dered phases have utilized motifbased model Hamiltonians,29
lowMadelung energy ordered structures, or lowenergy ordering
combined with statistical thermodynamics.28 We have previously
developed a methodology for prediction of defect formation en
ergy in alloys26 by modeling with special quasirandom structures
(SQS)30 and adapting the standard defect calculation approach
for disordered phases.31
Motivated by the growing interest in wurtzite AlNbased alloys
with group3 and rareearth elements, we now focus on the het
erostructural Al1xGdxN alloy in the wurtzite phase (Figure 1a). The goal of this study is to develop practical defect control strate
