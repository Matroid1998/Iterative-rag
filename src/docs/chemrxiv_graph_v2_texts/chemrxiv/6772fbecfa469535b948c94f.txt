Description:
Used in complexes for which intrinsic aqueous solubility is predicted using QSPR modelling.

Text:
In this respect, insilico estimation of the aqueous solubility for the large number of drug
candidates typically considered during lead optimization (before synthesis) is essential for streamlining and
accelerating this traditionally lengthy and costly process. It is currently estimated that 40 of marketed drug
products, and 7090 of drug candidates in development stages have a low aqueous solubility. This results
in low bioavailability, which often necessitates higher doses in the final formulations in order to achieve the
desired therapeutic effect. However, this can also increase the risk of toxicity.2
In this study, we use quantitative structureproperty relationship (QSPR) modelling to predict the intrinsic
aqueous solubility of platinum complexes.
