Description:
The rocksalt cubic PbS becomes orthorhombic when shaped into thin platelets.

Several studies have demonstrated that nanoplatelets can be much different from an ideal 
slice of the corresponding bulk material they are structurally less constrained than the bulk and can readily 
relax through structural distortions and altered lattice constants.8 For example, the rocksalt cubic PbS 
becomes orthorhombic when shaped into thin platelets,9 and CdSe zincblende nanoplatelets are better 
described by a tetragonal structure rather than the cubic structure of the bulk.10 Furthermore, due to their 
high surfacetovolume ratio the surface layers become a relevant fraction of the whole nanoplatelet, to the 
point that the type of surface termination affects the overall stoichiometry of the platelets and their physical 
properties.2,11 
The emergence of colloidal leadhalide perovskites considerably expanded the interest in 
nanoplatelets in the past five years.
