Description:
Inwardly oriented atoms in macrocycles, often protonated and positively charged.

Text:
Among the related macrocycles that feature four inwardly oriented nitrogen atoms, structures 
are usually characterized according to the number of protonated and positively charged nitrogen atoms and 
the overall architecture (Fig. 1a). Porphyrin exhibits a planar structure with two NH moieties; the 
truncation of one mesocarbon atom gives planar corrole with three NH moieties, which acts as a trivalent 
ligand to give rise to a variety of metal complexes with rich chemistry8. The use of an indole rather than a 
pyrrole moiety to construct the N4 macrocycle furnishes tetraindole with four NH moieties, which is 
reminiscent of a porphyrinogen and structurally deviates slightly from planarity9,10. Tetraindole is 
susceptible to oxidation, which causes it to act as a planar divalent ligand similar to porphyrin.
