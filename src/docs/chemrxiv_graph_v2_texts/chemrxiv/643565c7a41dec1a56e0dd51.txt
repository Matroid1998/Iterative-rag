Description:
Can propagate as dendrites in solid electrolytes, potentially causing short circuits.

Crucial to the operation
of solidstate batteries is the solid electrolyte, which must be able to compete with more
traditional liquid electrolytes with regards to ionic conductivity.15 Solid electrolytes are often
produced through the sintering of powders, yielding structures in which grain boundaries
(GBs) are highly prevalent.6,7 GBs should be expected to have profound impacts on the
performance of a device throughout its lifetime, some of which can be positive, such as the
observed increase in ionic conductivity of Li3PS4 containing nanosized grains.8 However, GBs
are generally considered to be performance bottlenecks in solid electrolytes and can cause
decreased ionic conductivity9,10 and even device failure through the propagation of lithium
dendrites, leading to short circuits.11,12
Clearly, an indepth understanding of the impact of GBs on solid electrolytes is essential,
but given that there is a huge variety of candidate electrolyte materials,1315 this is a not
a trivial feat.
