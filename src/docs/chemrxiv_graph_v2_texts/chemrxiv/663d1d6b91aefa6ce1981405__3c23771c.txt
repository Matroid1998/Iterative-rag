Description:
A material whose spectra are compared to graphene and graphite to interpret its components.

In Claramunt et al., 2015, we can find a different notation where D is D1, D2 is D, D3 is 
D and D4 is D. In Sousa et al., 2020, a further D5 component is used (see for instance the Raman spectrum 
decomposition in their Figure 2). Sadezky and coworkers give the following Raman shifts (cm1) 1580 (G), 1350 
(D1), 1620 (D2), 1500 (D3), 1200 (D4). Let us add 1700 (D5), according to Sousa et al., 2020. Here, our aim is that of showing spectra of graphene and graphene oxide, with respect to the graphite spectrum, to 
understand how many components are required to interpret the fingerprints.
