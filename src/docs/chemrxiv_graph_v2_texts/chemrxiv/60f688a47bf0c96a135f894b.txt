Description:
Involved in the study of Fe2 dimers for developing magnetostructural correlations.

Text:
For 
example, the study of oxobridged Fe2 dimers allowed the development of detailed magneto
structural correlations that can be translated to larger species,1 antiferromagnetically coupled Fe612 
ferric wheels revealed interesting quantum size effects manifested in stepped magnetisation,2 Fe1719 
was an early example of a molecule possessing a very large spin ground state,3 Fe8 was the second 
known example of a SingleMolecule Magnet,4 Fe14 was an early example of a compound displaying 
an enhanced magnetocaloric effect,5 and cages ranging in nuclearity from Fe13 to Fe34 have 
structures that conform to Archimedean and Platonic solids which aid understanding of the self
assembly of molecular oxides en route to mineral phases.6 High symmetry clusters are of particular 
interest as they may possess geometric spin frustration, a phenomenon whose definition has evolved 
from its strict initial derivation.7 Frustration can lead to some unusual and potentially useful low
temperature physics, a beautiful example being the Mo72Fe30 icosidodecahedron which shows 
anomalous magnetisation behaviour in an applied magnetic field.8 One synthetic methodology proven 
to enable the construction of such species is hydrosolvothermal synthesis, which typically exploits 
superheating reaction solutions under autogenous pressure.9 In the chemistry of polynuclear cluster 
compounds of paramagnetic transition metal ions, the temperature regimes employed (which are 
typically below 250 C) can lead to enhanced solubility, reduced solvent viscosity and increased 
reagent diffusion.
