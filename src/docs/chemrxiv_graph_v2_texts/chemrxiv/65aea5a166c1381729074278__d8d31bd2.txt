Description:
Accumulates with age in pilot whales, with concentrations potentially exceeding 500 mg Hg kg-1 in the liver.

Mercury (Hg) accumulates through trophic levels leading to high concentrations in major organs of predatory 
24 
animals1. As such, whales as an animal at the top of their food chain are exposed to Hg in high concentrations 
25 
through their diet and this results in a considerable accumulation of Hg in their major organs 2,3. For pilot whales, 
26 
it was previously shown that Hg accumulates with age and that concentrations may exceed 500 mg Hg kg1 in the 
27 
liver 2,4. Dietary sources are the main contributors for Hg, which for predatory whales typically consists of squid 
28 
and a variety of fish5.

Description:
Suggested to bind Lewis soft Se bases to form inert HgSe nanostructures.

Text:
Ingested MeHg is partially metabolised in a demethylation step as a protective mechanism 
29 
to shield organs from potentially severe toxic effects associated with high MeHg levels. Following demethylation, 
30 
Hg was suggested to bind Lewis soft Se bases present in larger selenoenzymes6 to form inert HgSe (tiemannite) 
31 
nanostructures 79. Nano and microsized HgSe crystals have been identified by several different analytical 
32 
techniques and in a wide range of organs and tissues of cetaceans including brain, liver, kidney, muscle, and 
33 
spleen 4,1013. Mapping with synchrotronXRF showed the colocation of Hg with Se and determined a median 
34 
molar ratio (0.71) of mercury to selenium.
