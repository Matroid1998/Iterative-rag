Description:
A complex where the capped square antiprismatic form dominates in crystal structures.

Text:
The nine
coordinated complex is present as four diasteromeric forms. Two capped square antiprismatic cSAP enantiomers, and two capped 
twisted square antiprismatic cTSAP enantiomers. In Gd.DOTA and Eu.DOTA the cSAP form dominates, and most crystal structures 
are for this form of the complex.2730 
In solution all eight forms must be considered,21 and all experiments must be considered to be reporting on all forms.31, 32 Thus, 
building direct structureproperty relationships requires studies of crystalline systems. To relate the crystal structures of complexes 
from different compounds, a measure of the actual site symmetry must be used. We recently introduced the symmetry deviation 
value, ideal,33, 34 that compares coordination geometries between compounds and relate the coordination geometry to idealised 
polyhedra. Here, we expand the idealvalue for use with ninevertex coordination geometries.
