The interplay of the intramolecular, or internal, energy of a molecule and the nonbonded
energetics that determine its interactions with its environment play a crucial role in simu
lations of protein folding,3 crystal structure prediction,4 proteinligand binding,5 and many
more. In particular, oral drugs are typically exible, containing on average 5.4 rotatable
bonds,6 and are therefore capable of populating many free energy minima both in solution
and also when bound to their target.
