Description:
Prototypical materials with structural and chemical properties inspiring research into lead-free alternatives.

Text:
Lead is toxic and when released from the 
perovskite structure into the soil it is 10 times more bioavailable than other natural lead sources.24
The exceptional optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites, along with these stability and toxicity 
drawbacks, have spurred major research interest in perovskiteinspired materials.5,6 These are materials with 
similar structural andor chemical properties to the prototypical halide perovskites, but avoiding the presence 
of lead.
