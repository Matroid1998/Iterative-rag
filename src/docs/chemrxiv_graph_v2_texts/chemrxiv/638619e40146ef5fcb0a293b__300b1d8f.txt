Description:
An element with advantages over lithium in terms of abundance, distribution, and cost.

Text:
Even though lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have achieved unprecedented commercial success 
in the previous decades, uneven distribution and poor abundance of lithium lead to raw material 
supply tensions that pose a severe challenge for their use in largescale applications.1,2 In this regard, 
sodiumion batteries (NIB) are an attractive complementary technology that shares a similar working 
principle and cell engineering to LIBs.3,4 Sodium has numerous advantages over Li in terms of 
abundance (23,000 ppm vs. 20 ppm in the earths crust), distribution, and cost, offering economic 
sustainability.5 However, one of the significant drawbacks of NIBs is their lower energy density than 
LIBs.

Description:
Involved in sodium ion chemistries offering high power capabilities.

Text:
In turn, sodium ion chemistries such as Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) hard carbon (HC) and 
Prussian blue analogs (PBA) hard carbon offer highpower capabilities making them more attractive 
and cheaper alternatives for highpower applications610 such as hybrid grid storage, power tools, fast 
(dis)charging electromotive, military equipment, etc. In this context, our group in collaboration with the Naion battery startup TIAMAT Energy 
(France) is actively working to develop highpower NVPF  HC based Naion cells. NVPF is a 
structurally robust material, which usually shows a reversible capacity of 120 mAhg (Supporting 
Fig. S1) and exhibits excellent cycling performance at ambient temperature.1113 The NVPF voltage 
profile displays two distinct steps (Supporting Fig. S1) at 3.7 V and 4.2 V, corresponding to the 
subsequent (de)insertion of two sodium ions from one formula unit.
