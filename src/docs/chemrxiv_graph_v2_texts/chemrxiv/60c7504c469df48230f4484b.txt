Text:
Carbohydrate biomass is an abundant renewable resource which has enormous potential for the synthesis of valuable 
chemical building blocks.1 The sugars present in this material are of particular interest as a functionalised carbon 
source to produce chiral saturated heterocycles which are of widespread potential utility in pharmaceutical 
development.2 Whilst there are many wellestablished methods for converting sugars into chiral heterocycles such 
as tetrahydrofurans (THFs) and tetrahydropyrans (THPs), these typically rely on lengthy synthetic sequences 
involving the extensive use of protecting groups and high costenergy reagents (e.g.
