Description:
A 5-coordinate atom that is unlikely to occur in druglike molecules.

Text:
These validity problems can be broken down into those related to the semantics of SMILES strings, 
versus those that involve invalid syntax. Typically, the former refer to atom valences that are unlikely 
to occur, or indeed never occur, in druglike molecules; for example, a 5coordinate carbon. Here we 
focus instead on the problem of invalid syntax, the majority of which involve either parenthesis 
notation for branches or ring closure notation.
