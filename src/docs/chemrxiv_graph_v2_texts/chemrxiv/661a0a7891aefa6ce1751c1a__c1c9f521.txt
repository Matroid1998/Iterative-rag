Description:
A newly designed triarylpropargyl cation.

of strong electron
donating substituents. Molecular design that does not rely solely on strong electrondonating groups is required, 
which would not only allow for accurate elucidation of the electronic properties but also pave the way for further 
developments in the chemistry of propargyl cations. The major degradation processes of propargyl cations 
involve nucleophilic attack on the C3 atom corresponding to the cationic centre of the allenyl cation form, and 
subsequent tautomerization into thermodynamically stable vinyl ketone derivatives.15,16 Thus, by sterically 
protecting the C3 position, we conceived that stable triarylpropargyl cations could be made without strong 
electrondonating groups, and newly designed triarylpropargyl cations 1,2 mesitylethynylsubstituted bis(4
methoxyphenyl)methyl cation and xanthenyl cation.
