Environmentally andor biologically important ions species, as the notable food contaminants and 
environmental pollutants, can not only destroy ecosystems but also be terribly harmful to human health.15 
Among them, as the most plentiful metal element in the earths crust, aluminum is a nonessential trace 
elements, widely exist in our daily life and adversely affect human health, and is largely applied to industrial 
production, however, these industrial activities can lead to the overexposure of Al3 to environment, followed 
by excessive Al3 accumulation in the body and plant, can damage the brain, occurring hypomnesia, 
Alzheimers disease, may also cause kidney and liver insufficiency, osteoporosis and other diseases, as well 
as the abnormal growth of plant.610 On the other hand, it has been treated as food contaminants to be regulated, 
as the permissible limit of WHO guideline for Al3 in drinking water is 7.4 M, thus it is of great 
momentousness to develop an simple and efficient way to sensing the contaminants Al3 ions in food and 
environment.
