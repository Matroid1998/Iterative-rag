Description:
A light-driven molecular motor system.

Text:
To date, a number of lightdriven rotary motor types has been 
introduced, most eminently overcrowded alkenes from the Feringa group,18, 37, 38 iminebased 
motors from Greb and Lehn,39, 40 and hemithioindigo (HTI)based systems from our group.4148 
More recent additions to lightdriven molecular motors inherit biomimetic chromophores49 or 
heterocyclic alkenes.50, 51 Currently, incorporation of light driven molecular motors into larger 
molecular setups is pursued in order to utilize the work that they can produce and to fulfill a specific 
task.52 In this context the active disentanglement of polymer strands,53, 54 transmission of motor 
rotation to remote entities,55 active acceleration of remote passive rotary motions,56 controlled 
motor motion restrictions,57 or energy storage and subsequent triggered reverse motor rotation58 
represent important steps to realize the full potential of molecular motors for driving advanced 
nanomachinery.
