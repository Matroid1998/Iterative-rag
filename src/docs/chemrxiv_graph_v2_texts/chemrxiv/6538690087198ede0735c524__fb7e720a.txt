Various synthesis 
methods have been investigated with the aid of advanced 
nanostructural analysis for nanostructured carbon materials, in
cluding arc discharge,10 template carbonization,2,11 conversion of 
graphene oxides12,13 to their reduced analog,13,14 fine organic 
synthesis,15,16 topochemical pyrolysis,1719 and chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD).2024 Consequently, many advanced carbon 
materials, including carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 
graphenes, structural graphite, and carbon foams have been de
veloped with improved physicochemical properties, and they are 
growing at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 6 
with an annual global market of 3 billion USD in 2015.25 They 
are extensively used as adsorbents,26 catalysts,2733 and catalyst 
supports,34 conductive additives,3537 and anode materials38 in 
batteries, supercapacitors,39,40 polymerelectrolyte fuel cells 
(PEFCs),41 and photothermal conversion.42 
In this context, the chemical science of twodimensional (2D) 
graphene and its zerodimensional (0D) and onedimensional 
(1D) analogs have been extensively studied in recent decades.

A 2D carbon material with high electrical conductivity and high thermal chemical stability.

Text:
Graphene,43 a 2Dcarbon material, was originally prepared by 
exfoliation, and its synthesis, analysis, and applications have 
been extensively investigated.4448 Singleplate graphene materi
als have high electrical conductivity and high thermalchemical 
stability; therefore, they are suitable for practical applications in 
energyrelated devices.

Description:
Materials that can be synthesized from a 2D scaffold to develop 3D graphene.

Text:
A class of 1Dgraphene, carbon nano
tubes49,50 and cylindrical analogs,51 has also been investigated for 
electrochemical and catalysis applications owing to their high 
electrical conductivity.52 
A challenging aspect is the synthesis of the corresponding 3D 
graphene materials5355 from a 2D scaffold.13 Reducing the di
mension of 2D graphene can be used to develop 3D graphene; 
the 0D analog of the fullerene family,56 a good electron accep
tor,57 can be used as a building block to develop 3Danalogs.58 
Catalytic carbonization has also been successfully applied to pre
pare 3D graphene architecture.23,29,59 However, the precise syn
thesis of 3Dordered graphene materials with welldefined neg
ativelycurved 3D networks60,61 remains an emerging topic since 
British scientists predicted imaginary carbon frameworks with 8
membered rings in hexagons to achieve a 3D structure with low 
strain.53 These materials are highly symmetric and possess 
highly ordered nanostructures that provide various fascinating 
functions (vide infra).
