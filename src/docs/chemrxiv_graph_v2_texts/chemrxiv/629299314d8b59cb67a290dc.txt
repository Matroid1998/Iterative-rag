ML techniques are effective at inferring patterns and uncovering trends 
from complex chemical processes or mechanisms when a database of a reasonable size is available. In the 
field of nanomaterials, ML has been used to extract data1416, discover novel materials1719, optimize 
chemical reactions2022, reveal underlying mechanisms23,24, and predict synthetic outcomes25. For example, 
support vector machine classification and regression models were used to synthetically control layer 
thickness of perovskite halide nanoplatelets26. In another application, Bayesian optimization was applied to 
improve monodispersity of PbS QDs, leading to the narrowest reported halfwidth at halfmaximum of 
absorbance of this material27. In 2020, Santos and coworkers published a study wherein different ML
