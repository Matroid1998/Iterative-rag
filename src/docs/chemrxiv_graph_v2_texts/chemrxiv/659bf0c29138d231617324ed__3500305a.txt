Description:
Used in silicon-based transistors, which are reaching their fundamental limit in size reduction.

Text:
The semiconductor industry is driven by the continued 
reduction in transistor size, with Moores law stating that the 
number of transistors that can fit on an integrated circuit doubles 
approximately every eighteen months.21 These days, the stateof
theart siliconbased transistor has all but reached its fundamental 
limit and, to further break through the gate length of siliconbased 
fieldeffect transistors,22 materials that can achieve smaller sizes 
than silicon are sought. Twodimensional (2D) materials have an 
inherent advantage for transistor applications because they are 
intrinsically stable at atomic thicknesses and still have robust and 
wellcharacterized electrostatic properties.23 In a study by Xie et al.
