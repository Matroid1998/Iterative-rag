Description:
Reactive zerovalent form is converted into more complex compounds in the formose reaction.

Text:
The formose reaction (FR)1 has attracted attention since its discovery, especially due
to its potential relevance to the origins of life for reasons which reflect changing conceptions
of what life fundamentally is and how life may have begun2. The FR converts plausibly
prebiotic environmentallysupplied reactive zerovalent carbon in the form of HCHO into
more complex compounds which are important for biology, for example aldonic acids that
