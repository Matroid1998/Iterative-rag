Cyclobutanes are one of the most fundamental strained fourmember ring structural motifs in natural products, 
materials science, biologically active compounds, and the pharmaceutical industry.14 This includes the boron
containing cyclobutane rings, which have increasingly attracted attention as appealing building blocks for 
synthetic organic chemistry, because they provide opportunities for further modifications of the cyclobutyl 
moiety, including introducing this motif into complex important structures.5,6 While numerous approaches have 
been devised for the synthesis of cyclobutylboronic derivatives,69 strategies for constructing cyclobutanes with 
even higher boryl content e.g.

with geminateddi, tri, and tetraboryls have been seldom reported.6,9 Yet, 
establishing an efficient pathway to these novel motifs is anticipated to reshape the landscape of cyclobutane 
construction and broaden their applications significantly by enabling the selective modification of the multiple 
versatile CB bonds within these structures.
