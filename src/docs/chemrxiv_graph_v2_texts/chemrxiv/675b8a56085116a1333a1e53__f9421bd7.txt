Description:
A drug used in combination with other medications to treat tuberculosis.

Text:
The general cause of TB mostly stems from the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
causing an infection mainly to the respiratory tract, with some cases affecting the 
gastrointestinal tract 1. Before the discovery of antibiotics, TB treatment was mostly to 
rest the body and let the immune system fight the infection. However, some prescribe 
cod liver oil, vinegar massages, and turpentine as possible cures 2. However, TB 
infection is usually treated with a regiment of drugs, with the first iteration in the 1950s 
being a combination of streptomycin, paraaminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid 3. Following the discovery of antibiotics, mainly Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and 
Rifampicin, the survival rate of TB patients increased as a more effective method became 
widely available. Ethambutol inhibits cell wall synthesis, targeting arabinosyl 
transferase.
