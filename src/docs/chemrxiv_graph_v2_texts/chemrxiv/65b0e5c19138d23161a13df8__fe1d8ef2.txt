Description:
Each panel in macrocycles can be reduced by up to two electrons with concurrent uptake of metal cations from the electrolyte.

Their structures are adjustable and their electrochemical properties are tunable, they can have a 
high energy density and long cycling stability, and the solidstate diffusion of ions is not 
relevant in their performance. Among the quinonebased redoxactive organic electrode 
materials, pillarquinones and calixquinones are particularly attractive due to their high 
theoretical specific capacity (446 mAh g1) and ease of synthesis.5 Each parabenzoquinone 
panel in these macrocycles can be reduced by up to two electrons with concurrent uptake of 
metal cations from the electrolyte. In addition, these macrocyclic quinones possess a cavity and 
thus have intrinsic porosity, which can improve ion diffusion in the electrode.
