Description:
Used for catalytic oxidation of formaldehyde.

Text:
This method has significant advantages of requiring simple
equipment, exhibiting no secondary pollution and having high efficiency. Traditional
catalysts mainly include precious metal and metal oxides.9,10 Platinum (Pt),10,11 aurum
(Au),12,13 and argentum (Ag)14,15 are currently used for catalytic oxidation of
formaldehyde. Although precious metals can achieve 100 removal efficiency (RE)
