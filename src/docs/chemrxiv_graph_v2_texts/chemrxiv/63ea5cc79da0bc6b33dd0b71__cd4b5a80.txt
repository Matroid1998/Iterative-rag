Description:
An element used as an anode in lithium-sulfur batteries, participating in redox reactions.

Text:
Lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries are among the most promising nextgeneration energy storage
systems that have the potential to surpass traditional lithiumion batteries in terms of both
energy density and cost.13 These batteries are composed of a lithium anode and a sulfur
cathode and operate through a redox reaction in which lithium ions are transferred between
the two electrodes.
