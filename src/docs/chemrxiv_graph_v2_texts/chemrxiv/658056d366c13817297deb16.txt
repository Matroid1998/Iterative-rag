Description:
A significant greenhouse gas emitted from global oil and gas supply chains.

Text:
Methane emissions from sources in global oil and gas supply chains are estimated as 
approximately 100 Tgyr, accounting for approximately 1520 of total global anthropogenic, 
biogenic and geogenic emissions (Saunois et al., 2020). Large emission events, with estimated 
emission rates 100 kgh, have been identified as a significant source of methane emissions 
from the oil and gas sector. For example, Cusworth et al. (2022) made aerial observations across 
multiple oil and gas production basins in the San Joaquin Valley, Uinta, DenverJulesburg, 
Permian, and Marcellus production basins in the United States and estimated that point source 
emissions 10 kgh accounted for 40 of regional methane fluxes. Stokes et al.

Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted from oil and gas sector sources.

Text:
(2022) reported 
on measurements from tank battery sites in the Permian Basin and concluded that 8090 of 
emissions from the tank battery sites were accounted for by sites with emissions rates 10 kgh, 
and 5065 of emissions were accounted for by sites with emissions in excess of 100 kghr. Rapidly identifying and mitigating these large emission events has the potential to significantly 
reduce methane emissions from oil and gas sector sources, however, large emission events are 
widely distributed in time and space, and efficiently identifying these events is a challenge for 
many types of methane emission detection technologies.
