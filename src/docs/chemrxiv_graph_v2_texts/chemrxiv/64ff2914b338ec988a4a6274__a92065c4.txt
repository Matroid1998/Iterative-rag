Description:
Oxidative derivatives of guanine are a major concern in DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species and ionizing radiation.

Text:
DNA holds all of the genetic information required for development and survival for every liv
ing species and therefore is crucially important to protect from damage. Unfortunately, DNA
is constantly exposed to harmful sources such as radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS),
and other chemical agents. In response, our cells have developed ecient mechanisms for
recognizing and repairing various DNA defects. These mechanisms are of prime signicance
as damage to the genome can lead to the development of diseases such as neurodegenerative
disorders and cancer. A substantial fraction of these lesions are defect bases originating from the interaction of
DNA with ROS and ionizing radiation 13 and the majority among these concern oxidative
derivatives of guanine (G).

Description:
A nucleobase that can form hydrogen bonds with cytosine.

Text:
Unlike normal guanine, 8oxoG can more readily form
a hydrogenbonded pair with adenine (A) instead of cytosine (C), resulting in CG to AT
mutations during replication.10,11 Calculations at the singlefew basenucleotide level sug
gest that 8oxoG has an even lower VIE than G.1215 Moreover, computational investigations
showed that Grich5,11,15,16 and 8oxoGcontaining11,15 fragments of up to 3 base pairs have
lower IEs than single G and 8oxoG fragments, consistent with experimental studies9,17,18
