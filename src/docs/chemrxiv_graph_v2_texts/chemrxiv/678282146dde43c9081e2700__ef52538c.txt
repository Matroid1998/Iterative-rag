Description:
Associated with contested oxidation numbers, specifically Ce oxidation number (III or IV).

A major challenge in lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) chemistry is the characteriza
tion of the valence fshell properties, in particular the identification and quantifica
tion of Ln 4f and An 5f covalency. Therefore, fshell covalency is the focus of many
ongoing experimental, theoretical, and joint efforts. This knowledge is of paramount
importance for a wide range of applications, such as for the rational design of new f
element materials. The quantification of covalency is also directly associated with the
assignment of the metal oxidation numbers, which are sometimes hotly contested in f
element chemistry. For example, the literature about the Ce oxidation number (ON)
of cerocene (III or IV ?)
