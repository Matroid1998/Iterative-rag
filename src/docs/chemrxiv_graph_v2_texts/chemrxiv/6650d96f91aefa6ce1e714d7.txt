Description:
A fundamental element present in various forms such as graphite, graphene, and diamond.

Text:
In the singlewalled 
nanotubes, a graphite layer is rolled up to form the tube. Consequently, in the Raman spectra we must 
have the signature of curvature and related broken symmetry and quantization. The result is band splitting. Fig. 1 Here we reproduce the panel (a) of Figure 1 in Wu et al., 
2018, Open Access, CC BYNC 3.0 DEED, which is giving the 
Raman spectra of carbon solids and nanostructures, including 1D 
carbon wires, spsp2 carbon, amorphous carbon (aC), graphite, 
graphene, singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), C60, and 
diamond. Raman spectra have been reproduced with permission
