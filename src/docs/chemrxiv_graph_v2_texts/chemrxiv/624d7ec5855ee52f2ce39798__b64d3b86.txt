Solubilizes as 21 complexes with borate.

of ring torsion, 
consistent with the configurational changes required in 1a 
(Table S4). In addition to this ester, we observed two distinct 
minor components in the mixture, which exhibited identical 
coupling constants to 1a and existed in similar concentrations 
(ca. 11.2 
ratio). Based 
on 
the 
wellcharacterized 
diastereomeric borate ester dimers of methyl apiose 
described by Ishii and Ono57 and the report of purine 
nucleoside solubilization as 21 complexes with borate by 
Tsuji and colleagues,58 we tentatively ascribe these species 
as the cis and transisomers 1a (Figs. 1G and F). Overall, 
the Gibbs free energies obtained experimentally by NMR 
spectroscopy or equilibrium state calculations based on UV 
data ( ca. 32 kJ mol1, see the SI for details) are 
comparable to those obtained by DFT calculation.
