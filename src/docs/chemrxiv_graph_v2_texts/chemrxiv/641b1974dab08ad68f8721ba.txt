Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have emerged as a promising class of 
organic molecules with the potential for unconventional electronic and magnetic 
devices.1 Among them, triangulene is particularly noteworthy, as it features the 
smallest nanographene with a triplet ground state, which has sparked great research 
interest since its first synthesis.24 Its intriguing metalfree magnetism and 
captivating nonKekul structure, where all of the 22 electrons are impossible to 
concomitantly pair into a closedshell structure, offer immense prospects for the 
development of nextgeneration molecular spintronic materials, such as spin filters 
and qubits for quantum computing. Triangulene has been proposed as a prototype for
