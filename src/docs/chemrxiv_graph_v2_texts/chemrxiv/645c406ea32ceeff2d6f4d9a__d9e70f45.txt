Description:
A class of nucleophiles used in transition metal-free C(sp3)H amidation.

Coppercatalyzed platforms, including var
iants of the original KaraschSosnocky reaction6 as well as more 
recent developments by Stahl, Liu, and others have proven most 
versatile, enabling CH (sulfonyl)amidation,713 azolation,14 
and azidation.15,16 Alternatively, transition metalfree platforms 
for C(sp3)H (sulfonyl)amidation1719 and C(sp3)H azolation20
23 exist, but each method and reaction conditions is confined to 
a single nucleophile class (amides, sulfonamides, or azoles, but 
never all three within one protocol). Moreover, many still re
quire stoichiometric strong oxidants such as Selectfluor, NFSI, 
or DDQ, which limit the scope of the methods. Thus, 
identification of reagents and catalysts that can enable selective 
activation of a wider array of C(sp3)H partners, under more 
practical and functional grouptolerant conditions, and with 
greater generality with respect to NHnucleophile identity 
would be of broad value.
