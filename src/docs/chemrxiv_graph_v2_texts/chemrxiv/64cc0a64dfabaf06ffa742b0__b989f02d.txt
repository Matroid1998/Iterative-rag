34) As a result, new approaches and technologies to understand unique structural andor thermodynamic 
properties of RNA could provide unique solutions in RNAcentered therapeutics. Binding affinity, selectivity, and biostability of RNA are some of the properties, which can be regulated by 
modified RNA residues in oligonucleotide therapeutics. For example, locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues have 
been shown to enhance binding affinities and specificities in RNA and DNA,(3538) and, thus, have been 
exploited for different biomolecular purposes such as protecting short interfering RNAs (siRNA) against 
ribonucleases,(39,40) gene silencing(41,42) and RNA splicing. (43,44) LNA residues are unnatural nucleotides, 
where O2 and C4 atoms are connected by a methylene bridge locking the sugar pucker specifically to C3endo 
conformation.
