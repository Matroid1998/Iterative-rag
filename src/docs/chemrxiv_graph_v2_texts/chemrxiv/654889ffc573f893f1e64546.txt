Description:
Administers the cleavage of glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides through a copper-containing active site.

Text:
Part of the solution may come from the production of fuel and chemicals from ligno
cellulose which comprise an abundant and cheap resource that does not compromise food
security.46 Yet, the costefficient production of biofuels and materials or chemicals from
lignocellulose is currently hampered by its natural recalcitrance.7 Consequently, the discov
ery of a new class of enzymes that boosts the degradation of polysaccharides has attracted
considerable attention.712 This enzyme class is now termed lytic polysaccharide monooxy
genases (LPMOs) and is currently grouped into eight families AA9 to AA11 and AA13 to
AA17.8,9,1319 The LPMOs differ in substratespecificity8,1416,1925 but they generally cat
alyze the oxidation of the glycosidic CH bonds in the polysaccharide, leading ultimately to
a cleavage of the glycosidic bond.10,11,26 This cleavage causes the boosting effect and is ad
ministered by a coppercontaining active site with Cu coordinated by two histidines7,1619,27
that has been coined the histidine brace.22 The active site with the histidine brace in the
Cu(II)resting state is shown in Fig.
