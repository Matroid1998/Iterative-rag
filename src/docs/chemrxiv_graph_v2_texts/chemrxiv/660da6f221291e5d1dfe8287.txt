Description:
A cofactor for transaminases that facilitates the reversible transfer of an amine.

Text:
Transaminases are pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP)dependent enzymes that catalyze the reversible transfer of an 
amine from a donor substrate to a ketone or aldehyde via a pingpong mechanism.1,2 The synthetic value of transaminases is 
derived from their ability to furnish enantioenriched primary amines,35 and this transmission of chiral information from 
catalyst to product has been extended to adjacent stereocenters via dynamic kinetic resolutions (DKRs, Scheme 1A).610 Be
cause transaminasecatalyzed reactions are reversible, several strategies to drive equilibria toward the product have been 
explored.
