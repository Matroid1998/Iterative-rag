Description:
One of the most studied atomic layer deposition processes.

Aluminium (Al) is one of the more earth abundant elements, 
with huge variety of applications, ranging from simple 
applications like packaging material to light weight material for 
aerospace applications, while being comparably inexpensive in 
contrast to many transition metals or rareearth metals.15 For 
the microelectronic industry Al and especially Alcomposite 
films have become indispensable,69 with trimethylaluminium 
(TMA) as one of the prominent precursors for vapor phase 
deposition and the TMAH2O as one of the most studied atomic 
layer deposition (ALD) processes.10 Although the majority of Al
related chemical vapor depositionbased processes are 
targeted towards the deposition of Al2O3 thin films,11 AlN and Al 
thin films recently have drawn increased interest for 
applications in microelectronics as insulator and wide bandgap 
semiconductor (AlN),1214 gate electrode material (Al)9 or for 
hydrogen storage applications.1517 
For the fabrication of such thin films chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) and its abovementioned variant ALD are the 
methods of choice.
