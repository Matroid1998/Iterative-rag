Description:
Compounds likely serving a defensive role or acting as pheromones in millipedes.

Text:
The ecological role of the terpenoid alkaloids remains unclear, 
however it is likely that they serve a defensive role, act as pheromones, 
or are cooptimized to function in both capacities.12,13 Like all 
millipedes, 
Colobognatha 
have 
evolved 
specialized 
glands
repugnatorial glands opening through ozoporeswhich are located 
bilaterally, with two glands per segment.8 Some species of 
Colobognatha possess up to 330 segments.14 The alkaloids are known to 
be secreted through the ozopores upon disturbance and several of them 
(e.g, glomerin, polyzonimine, buzonamine, and the ischnocybines) have 
been reported to deter commonly encountered predators (e.g., spiders, 
cockroaches, flies and ants, respectively).8,1518 However, only the 
ischnocybines and spiropyrrolizidine have been evaluated in a range of 
receptor assays.
