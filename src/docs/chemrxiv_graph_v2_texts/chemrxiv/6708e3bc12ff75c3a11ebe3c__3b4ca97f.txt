On the downside, 
hydrogel membranes are susceptible to fouling caused by the deposition of colloidal matter, organic 
substances or biofilms.18,19 To prevent membrane fouling, antifouling materials such as nanoparticles 
need to be incorporated into the hydrogel.20 However, the aggregation and leaching of nanoparticles in 
polymer mixtures complicate the synthesis of hydrogels with uniformly distributed nanoparticles across 
the membrane.21 
Recently, the fabrication of hydrogel membranes with homogeneously covered nanoparticle surfaces 
has been introduced using bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels).2226 Bijels are 
porous materials formed from arresting the phase separation of a mixture of oil and water with silica 
nanoparticles.27,28 Unlike most hydrogels which are prepared from the phase separation of polymer 
solutions, bijels are formed with monomers as the oil phase which are polymerized after phase separation 
to solidify the hydrogel membrane.23,29 The nanoparticledecorated surfaces make bijeltemplated 
hydrogels interesting functional materials for stimuliresponsive membrane separations.
