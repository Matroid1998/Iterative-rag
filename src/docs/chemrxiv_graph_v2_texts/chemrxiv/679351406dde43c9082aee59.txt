Description:
Produced through light-driven photocatalytic water reduction as a potential solution for sustainable energy.

Text:
Signicant emphasis has recently been placed on developing innovative methods to harness
green and sustainable energy sources. For instance, lightdriven photocatalytic water re
duction, resulting in the production of molecular hydrogen has demonstrated its ability to
oer solutions to the evergrowing global energy demand13 However, for this to become
a reliable building block of a sustainable economy, research must address the challenge of
environmentally friendly hydrogen production. Photocatalytic reactions involving transition
metal complexes are a possible and perhaps viable method in this respect.4 However, these
systems come with problems of their own, centered around low yields, unsatisfactory sta
bility, and the low abundance of rare earth materials often contained in the highpotential
