of surface compressive stresses and can even remove atoms from 
the material.42 These surface effects impact not only the primary surface atoms, but cause 
distortions propagating inwards two to four atomic layers (Figure 4).42 To probe this effect, we 
collected selected area electron diffraction (SAED) data of undeformed single nanoplates before 
and after ligand exchange (Figure 4b, Table S4). Since surface atoms make up a nonnegligible 
percentage of thin nanoplates (10), lattice measurements from electron diffraction patterns for 
an entire particle should show deviations from the expected value if large surface reorganizations 
exist. Correlated lattice measurements were obtained for nine individual nanoplates capped first 
with carboxylate ligands (black) and then exchanged to thiol ligands (red, Figure 4b). On average, 
carboxylatecapped nanoplates exhibited a lattice contraction of 6.7.

Description:
Ligands that can mediate lattice expansions and result in compressive surface stresses.

This value is consistent 
with minor relaxation of surface stress by a weaklybound physiosorbed ligand since bare metal 
surfaces are known to have lattice contractions of up to 15, resulting in tensile surface stresses 
of approximately 4 N m1.35, 40, 42 Once exchanged with thiol ligands, the nanoplates have an 
average lattice expansion of 11.8, which is in good agreement with literature studies that have 
seen thiolmediated expansions of up to 19 and resulting compressive surface stresses of 5 N 
m1.15, 39 While the orientation of the electron beam with respect to the nanoplate in SAED 
measurements can only capture the inplane lattice distortions, outofplane stresses of the same
