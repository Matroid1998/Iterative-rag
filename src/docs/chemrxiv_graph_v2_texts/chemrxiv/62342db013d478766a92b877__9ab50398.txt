Description:
Harmful pollutants formed from the burning of fossil fuels.

Text:
Despite the increasing use of clean energies in the energy supply system, traditional fossil 
fuels will continue to play a dominant role in the foreseeable future. This is particularly true in 
the transportation, where internal combustion engines use 70 of the nearly 90 million barrels 
of crude oil consumed worldwide each day. However, the burning of fossil fuels contributes 
significantly to the greenhouse effect and the climate change, in addition to the formation of 
various harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and soot. Soot is made of small carbon 
particles created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (1, 2).
