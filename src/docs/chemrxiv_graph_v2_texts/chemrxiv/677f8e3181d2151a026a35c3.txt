The detection and control of dioxygen concentration are crucial in various fields, including industrial chemistry, 
agrifood, environmental sciences, and clinical analysis.13 As an example, molecular oxygen plays a key role 
in biological processes, making its detection important to understand physiological and pathological 
phenomena. Among all existing techniques (the Winkler, amperometric and pressurebased methods), optical 
methods offer a noninvasive and precise alternative for dioxygen detection, with advantages such as rapid 
response, high sensitivity, and ease of miniaturization, leading to an increased interest in the design of optical 
dioxygen molecular sensors.4 
Since the seminal discovery of Kautsky and Hirsch in 1931,5 it is well established that emission and, more 
particularly, phosphorescence emission of chromophores decreases in the presence of dioxygen.
