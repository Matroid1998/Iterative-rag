The positively charged 
arginine side chain is an important interaction partner in the 
binding to other proteins, nucleic acids or small molecules.2024 
The guanidinium moiety of arginine contributes to cation and 
 interactions, contains up to five hydrogen bond donors and is 
frequently involved in stabilizing salt bridges.25,26 Unlike other 
positively charged residues, such as lysine or histidine, arginine 
retains its ionized state even in the hydrophobic core of folded 
proteins under all biologically relevant pH values due to the 
stabilizing mesomeric effect of the guanidinium group.27,28 Fast 
solventhydrogen exchange and the resulting line broadening 
often impedes the application of routine 1H15N HSQC spectra 
when probing the arginine side chain.20,21,29 Unlike in the case of 
many aliphatic (Ile, Leu, Val)18,19 or aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, 
Trp),17,30,31 the bacterial biosynthesis of arginine features no 
direct ketoacid precursor.32 Therefore, adding a more simple, 
achiral labelled compound from the biosynthetic pathway to the 
medium of a bacterial overexpression system for selective 
labelling of the target amino acid is not possible.

Description:
An amino acid used in the overexpression of the model protein ubiquitin.

Text:
We implemented a synthetic route to access 13C2H15N 
arginine 12 (Figure 1). To investigate the incorporation efficiency, 
we used this isotopelabelled Arg in the E. coli based 
overexpression of the model protein ubiquitin. Moreover, we 
showed the utility of our approach by studying the interaction of 
ubiquitin and the third Src homology 3 domain (SH3) of the 
cytoskeletal protein binding domain Sla1.33 Our method is a 
general approach to explore, for example, dynamics and 
interaction of arginine side chains, taking advantage of well
resolved 1H13C or 13C15N correlations in future studies.
