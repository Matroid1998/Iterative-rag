Description:
An element whose concentrations can vary seasonally when water is treated to remove particles and dissolved organic matter.

Lead is a contaminant of concern in drinking water due to its welldocumented health 
effects.1,2 Many jurisdictions require that it be monitored, but seasonal variation in lead 
release can bias monitoring programs if it is not understood and accounted for. Temperaturedriven lead seasonality has been described in previous work,3 and 
sampling guidance is often designed to control for temperature effects.4 
But water quality parameters other than temperature can contribute to seasonal lead 
concentrations, and aluminum is an important example. Aluminum concentrations can 
vary seasonally when water is treated to remove particles and dissolved organic matter
