Description:
Concentrations in some U.S. wells exceed the advisory limit of 300 Âµg/L.

Text:
The recommended dietary allowance is about 2 mgday, which is readily 
achieved through food such that deficiencies in humans have not been reported. Typical 
blood concentrations range from 4 to 15 g L1. On the basis of this evidence, the EPA 
has no standard limit on manganese in drinking water, with the advisory limit at 300 g 
L1 (300 ppb or 5.5 M). Thousands of wells in the U.S have been found to be 
contaminated with Mn2 concentrations exceeding this generous limit 13. There is 
currently no known biological requirement for vanadium (V) in humans.
