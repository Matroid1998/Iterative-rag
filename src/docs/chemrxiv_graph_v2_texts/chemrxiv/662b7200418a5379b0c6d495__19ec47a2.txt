Description:
A molecule characterized by a double bond CC ene.

Text:
The proposed tetC5 
was found to be cohesive and stable both mechanically and dynamically, and exhibit an original 
undocumented topology. In a subsequent step, new tetragonal C6 and C7 allotropes were 
proposed and analyzed simultaneously with tetC5. From a chemical point of view, C5 and C6 
emphasize the double bond CC ene, as in the ethene molecule, C2H4. Remarkably linear C3 
CCC resembling the allene or propadiene molecule, C3H4, characterize C7. After this contextual introduction and Section 2, which presents the computational framework, 
the crystal chemistry rationale leading to the novel tetragonal C5, C6 and C7 allotropes is 
discussed. Section 3 is devoted to the crystal engineering protocol used to develop the various 
allotropes.
