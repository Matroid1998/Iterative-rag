Description:
Involves a covalent irreversible complex in its drug action mechanism.

Text:
Irreversible bimolecular complexes are highly desirable because (1) the residence of one molecule 
inside the cavity of another molecule is permanent until the breakdown of the cavitycontaining 
molecule, (2) the complex formation is onetoone stoichiometric, and (3) for drug therapy the 
permanent residence and 11 stoichiometry confer the cavityresiding molecule with desired high 
metabolic stability, high potencytomass ratio, low acting dose, and low offtarget activity14. These 
complexes generally refer to covalent irreversible complexes that are selfassembled by two molecules 
between which there is a covalent bond resulting from the selfassembly process. The desirability of 
covalent irreversible complexes is apparent from the drug action mechanisms of aspirin5, penicillin6, 
and sotorasib7 all of which involve a covalent irreversible complex.
