Description:
An aqueous electrolyte used in supercapacitive swing adsorption.

Among them, supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) is a promising 
emerging technology capable of reversibly capturing and releasing CO2 by charging and discharging supercapacitor 
electrodes.17 Supercapacitors are capable of electrostatically storing a large number of charges inside the pores of high 
surface area electrodes in an electrical double layer.18,19 SSA is significantly simpler than other electrochemical sorption 
techniques, only requiring inexpensive, robust, and environmentally benign porous activated carbons and aqueous electrolytes 
(e.g. NaCl, NaHCO3). Supercapacitors allow for fast chargedischarge rates, have a high roundtrip energy efficiency, and a 
long lifetime ( 105 cycles). This is an advantage over electrochemical techniques that rely on the use of redoxactive sorbents 
or solvents (e.g.
