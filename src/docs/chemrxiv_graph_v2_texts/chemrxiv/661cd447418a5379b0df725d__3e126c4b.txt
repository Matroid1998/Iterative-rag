Description:
A fast ion conductor used to study dynamic lithium processes.

Text:
By using the UFP combined with a machine learning
model for EFG tensors, we can now extend the capabil
ities of NMR crystallography to make dynamical simu
lations on microsecond timescales a reality. Using this
UFPMLEFG model, we will demonstrate how to cal
culate the relevant ACF of quadrupolar precession fre
quencies for SAE experiments in the fast ion conductor
Li3PS4 (LPS). LPS is the ideal system to study dynamic
Li processes as it has both a crystalline (LPS) and
