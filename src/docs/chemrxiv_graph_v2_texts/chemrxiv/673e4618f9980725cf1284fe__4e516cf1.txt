Description:
A metal used in lithium-ion batteries, essential for their performance.

Today, most of the demand for portable energy storage is met by lithiumion batteries
(LIBs), which is largely due to their extraordinary performance, including high energy den
sity, operating voltage and long life cycle.1,2 However, problems arise in sourcing the needed
lithium and cobalt metal,3 meaning that state of the art LIBs may not be able to fulll the
growing demand for energy storage solutions. Hence, alternative battery concepts and new
battery materials are needed which allow for sustainable, safe, compact and high voltage
energy storage systems.47 While it seems unlikely that alternative battery technologies will
be able to surpass Li in the area of portable batteries, there is also a growing demand for
stationary energy storage and heavyduty systems.
