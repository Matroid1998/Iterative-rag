Description:
The main oxidant of the P450 catalytic cycle.

This is 
hampered by the need for external electron transfer part
ners and nicotinamide cofactors (NAD(P)H) to initiate reac
tions.13 Others have attempted to overcome this by reducing 
a crystal of substratebound P450s with electrons from the 
Xray beam and in certain instances this can result in oxida
tion.1416 This approach has also led to the proposed for
mation of electron density consistent with an oxyferryl (Cpd 
I), the main oxidant of the P450 catalytic cycle.17 18 
An alternate strategy to initiating enzymatic reactions in 
protein crystals of P450 enzymes is the use of the peroxide 
shunt pathway.19 The peroxide shunt pathway is able to 
generate Cpd I (Scheme 1) directly using hydrogen perox
ide.
