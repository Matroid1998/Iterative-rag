Description:
Spheres that terminate growth after surface edges meet creating a closure.

21 Even if it could be seeded with a 
negatively curved element, its subsequent growth is possible not 
just in one but many ways the exact number of which we do not 
know yet. Unlike fullerene spheres, TPMS growth does not termi
nate after surface edges meet creating a closure. Instead, it contin
ues facing a vast number of options. It is not only a different curva
ture that may form, but also type of TPMS, or several types that 
might start growing simultaneously on different sides of a joined 
piece without a possibility for separation later. Not surprisingly, all 
attempts to grow spontaneously and hopes to isolate any 
Schwarzite in symmetrically pure state by brute force methods 
have failed.
