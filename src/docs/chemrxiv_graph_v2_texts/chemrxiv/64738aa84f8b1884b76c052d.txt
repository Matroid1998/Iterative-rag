Description:
Molecular oxygen can be converted to singlet oxygen (1O2) through energy transfer from photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.

Text:
From a 
photophysical point of view PDT golden standard relies on the 
activation of the photosensitizers (PS) using a specific light 
wavelength to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) and other reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) that can disrupt cellular macromolecular 
systems, such as nucleic acids, proteins and lipid membranes, 
and thus initiate cancer cell death. Interestingly, PDT is not only 
restricted to cancer treatment and can find useful applications 
also for antibacterial or antiviral purposes, or for food 
processing.810 To assure 1O2 efficient production, the PS should 
usually show a facile intersystem crossing leading to a high 
population of its triplet manifold and the subsequent energy 
transfer to the molecular oxygen to produce 1O2 or other ROS.

Description:
Molecular oxygen is activated in photodynamic therapy, but its efficiency is limited under hypoxic conditions in solid tumors.

Text:
Furthermore, PDT is relying on the 
activation of molecular oxygen and thus its efficiency is strongly 
limited in the case of solid tumors under hypoxia.1921 
Therefore, alternative cancer treatments need to be explored. In this context lightactivated chemotherapy (LAC) is a
