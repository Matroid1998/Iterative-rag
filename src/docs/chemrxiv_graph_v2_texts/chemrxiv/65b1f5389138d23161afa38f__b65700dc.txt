Description:
Forms a liquid mixture with good polar characteristics when mixed with other linear carbonates.

For 
these reasons, therefore, EC is mixed with other linear carbonates such as diethyl, dimethyl, or 
ethylmethyl carbonate, thus forming a liquid mixture with good polar characteristics. Although mixtures of linear carbonates and cyclic carbonates provide a serviceable solution to 
some extent, the most viable strategy, however, is to make use of electrolytes based on mixtures 
of ionic liquids (ILs) and organic electrolytes 9. ILs generally have negligible vapour pressure, 
high chemical and thermal stability 10. Nevertheless, the potential application of IL electrolytes 
for LIBs has been overshadowed by their high viscosity which induces low wettability of the 
electrode surface and low ionic conductivity 11.
