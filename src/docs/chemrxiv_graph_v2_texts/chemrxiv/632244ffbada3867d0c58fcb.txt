Description:
Synthesized using methods like Friedel-Crafts acylation, Vilsmeier-Haack reaction, and indole Grignard reaction.

Text:
Common methods to synthesize 3acylindoles include the FriedelCrafts acylation,12,13,15
19,21 VilsmeierHaack reaction12,13,15,16,18,19,21 and indole Grignard reaction.12,13,15,16,18,19 
Generally, these often suffer from side reactions,12,13,15,16 like N1acylation or 
oligomerisation in the case of the FriedelCrafts acylation,12,13 and involve harsh reaction
