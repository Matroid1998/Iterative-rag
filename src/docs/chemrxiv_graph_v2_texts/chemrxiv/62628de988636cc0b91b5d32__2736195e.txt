Organometallic species bearing a polar carbonmetal bond occupy an indispensable 
position in organic chemistry owing to their high reactivity.1 As a representative, 
organomagnesium species, Grignard reagents, have been widely used for the synthesis of useful 
molecules ranging from bioactive compounds to organic semiconductors since its discovery in 
1900.2,3 Nowadays, a variety of polar organometallic species such as organolithiums, zincs, 
and aluminums are readily available and have significantly contributed to the development of 
organic chemistry. The preparation of such polar organometallics often depends on deprotonation at 
acidic CH bonds or on metalation of organic halides via a reductive process or halogenmetal 
exchange (Figure 1a).46 Although these methods are reliable, special classes of precursors, 
acidic hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds, are necessary.
