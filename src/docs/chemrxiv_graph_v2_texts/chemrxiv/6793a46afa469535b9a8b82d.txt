Description:
Used as protective hard coatings and gate oxides in microelectronics.

Text:
Protective coating materials are commonly grown by physical or chemical vapor deposition 
(PVD or CVD) techniques on cutting tools. This to improve the service life of the tools during 
the high temperatures, friction, wear, corrosion and oxidation leading to mechanical and 
thermal fatigue, during applications such as turning, milling, and drilling.1 Such coatings have 
been used in the form of nitrides, oxynitrides, carbides, carbonitrides, borides, boronitrides and 
oxides, where a lot of comparisons2 between PVD and CVD have been made. It can be noted 
that many of the nitride, oxide, and carbide protective hard coatings produced for the 
engineering and manufacturing industry are highly relevant also for the microelectronics field, 
e.g., as dielectrics, diffusion barriers,3 and gate oxides4.
