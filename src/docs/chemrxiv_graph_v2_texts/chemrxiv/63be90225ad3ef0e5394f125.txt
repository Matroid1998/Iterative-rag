Description:
Exhibits stimuli responsive behavior.

Text:
The presence of functional moieties such as spiropyran, ester and 
azo groups along with the rigid segments were shown previously to exhibit stimuli responsive 
behavior.1416 A prerequisite of flexibility in MOFs is bistability, namely the presence of more 
than one minimum in the free energy profile.17 For example in breathable mesoporous framework 
DUT49(Cu) two minima are observed and depending on the guest loading, the energy of these 
minima varies.18,19 In case of gating MOF DUT8(Ni), the close pore phase is 
thermodynamically stable, however, adsorption of guest molecules stabilizes the open pore (OP) 
phase energetically.20,21
