1a).1 As singleatom exchanges can exert tremendous impact on the 
physicochemical properties of molecules, methods to enable precise, latestage single atom 
molecular editing are highly soughtafter.2,6 In this work we present our strategy for a formal 
single atom OSexchange in the natural product antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx, 1) to overcome 
its acid lability with the ultimate goal to extend its application portfolio. The glycosylated macrolactone Fdx was approved in 2011 for the treatment of Clostridioides 
difficile (C. diff.) infections (CDI), that constitute one of the most common nosocomial 
infections.712 Alarmingly, the repertoire of therapeutic options for CDI is very limited,7,8,12,13 
and first Fdx resistant clinical C. diff.
