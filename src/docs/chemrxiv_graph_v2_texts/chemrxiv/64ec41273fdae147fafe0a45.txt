Description:
A cation involved in high-temperature single-molecule magnets with remarkable magnetic properties.

Text:
Singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) exhibit retention of magnetization under certain conditions, 
and therefore have potential applications in high density binary data storage.13 However, the 
viability of even the bestperforming SMMs in such applications is currently limited as the 
desired magnetic properties have not yet been observed at temperatures that are suitable for 
practical usage.415 Some of the most promising hightemperature SMMs that have been 
studied so far are those involving dysprosocenium cations and related derivatives;48 the 
remarkable magnetic properties of this family of complexes has been attributed to the 
incorporation of substituted cyclopentadienyl (CpR) ligands, which i) provide the steric bulk 
required to achieve axial ligand fields, enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the Dy3 cation 
and hindering Orbach relaxation; and, ii) are rigid and thus impede molecular vibrations, 
suppressing Raman relaxation.4,16,17 
Further stabilization of the ground mJ state of Dy3 in dysprosocenium cations, and 
concurrent destabilization of the least magnetic mJ state, could be achieved by increasing the 
strength of the axial ligand field through the reduction of DyCpR distances by using smaller 
CpR ligands.
