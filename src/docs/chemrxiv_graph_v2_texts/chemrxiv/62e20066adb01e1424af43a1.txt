Description:
Used as an electroactive filler in conductive biomaterials for bioelectronics.

Recent advancements in bioelectronics have offered soft, tunable, biocompatible, and electroactive 
organic materials to interface living organisms with electronic devices.15 Such biomaterials have 
found utility within scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,68 where a 
combination of active (mixed ionic and electronic charge transport) and passive (surface 
chemistry, morphology, mechanics) properties can restore, maintain, or improve tissue function.9 
Conductive biomaterials are generally designed through the incorporation of an electroactive filler 
(conjugated polymer, carbon nanotube, metal nanowire) into an insulating biocompatible polymer 
matrix.1011 Conjugated polymers (CPs) have been used to great effect in bioelectronics and tissue 
engineering in particular due to their biocompatibility, possibility of unique form factors, and 
chemically tunable structures for the promotion of mixed conduction.9, 1215 For successful 
application within a bioelectronic technology, CPs with aqueous solubility, sites for covalent 
modification, electroactivity, and biocompatibility are generally required.
