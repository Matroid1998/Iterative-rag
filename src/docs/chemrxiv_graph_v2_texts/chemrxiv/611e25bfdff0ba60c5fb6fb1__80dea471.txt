Description:
Used in the semiconductor industry as the interconnect material.

Text:
Copper (Cu) has been used in the semiconductor industry as the interconnect material for over 20 
years.1 However, the continuous deposition of conducting Cu films in the small and complex 
structures of present and future nanoelectronic device structures is, and will become more difficult. Copper requires a liner or seed layer to promote continuous film deposition. This layer is in 
addition to the barrier layer, which prevents the diffusion of Cu into the dielectric layer and Si 
substrates.2 As device dimensions shrink and more complex structures emerge, the volume 
available for copper interconnects at the transistor levels becomes correspondingly smaller and 
must accommodate the barrier, the liner and copper.
