Description:
Assigned to the Pu ion in PuO2 based on X-ray spectroscopic measurements and model calculations.

Text:
The magnetic susceptibility of PuO2 as a function of tem
perature is fully consistent with the assigned 5f 4 configuration and a nonmagnetic
ground state,3,4 although it took several decades of theoretical modeling to under
stand why the magnetic susceptibility is effectively constant in the temperature range
11000 K.5,6 A recent publication by Tobin et al.7 assigned the Pu ion in PuO2 as having
a 5f 5 configuration, however, and therefore a Pu(III) ion, based on Xray spectroscopic
measurements and accompanying model calculations. The present study was carried out to demonstrate that there is considerable ligand
tometal (LM) donation in PuO2, which leads to excess electron density in the 5f shell of
Pu.
