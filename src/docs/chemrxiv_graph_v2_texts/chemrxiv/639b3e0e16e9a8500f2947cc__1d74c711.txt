The global human population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022. According to the World Population 
Prospects 2022, it will grow to 8.5 billion in 2030, reaching 9.7 billion in 2050.1 This requires a sustainable 
agriculture system with efficient use of water, energy and nutrient resources, a reduction of 
environmental impacts, maintaining economic strength and minimizing dependence on finite depleting 
resources.2 

Fertilizers are necessary to replace nutrients that are depleted from the soil when plants are grown. The 
most prevalent nutrients for fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with calcium, 
magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc added less often or in lower 
amounts as micronutrients.36 Nitrogen is supplied in many forms  it can be supplied alone (e.g as 
anhydrous ammonia, urea, ureaammonium nitrate, etc.
