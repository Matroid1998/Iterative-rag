Description:
A well-studied metalorganic cage.

Text:
Due to the organic nature of the linkers, metalorganic cages are often stable in organic 
solvents, although some can also be stable in polar solvents such as water.7 The identity of the 
coordinating metal and linker molecules that form the cage walls can be modified to change the 
solubility or electronic properties of the cage.7,8 Particularly wellstudied cages include the 
Pd6L412,9 Co4L28,10 Pd2L44,11 In4L612 ,8 and Ga4L612 cages.12 Numerous other examples 
of cages with octahedral,13 cubic,14 and tetrahedral geometries exist,15 with increasing diversity in 
other cage topologies.16 
As more examples of cages emerge in the literature, computational studies have become 
central to understand the physical principles behind hostguest recognition,1720 predict the 
assembly of novel cage architectures,16,21,22 and identify opportunities for cagemediated catalytic 
rate enhancement.8,23 Experimental and computational efforts to understand the physics driving 
hostguest recognition have identified electrostatics,24 guest size,25 properties of counterions26, 
and solvent effects20 as factors that strongly influence hostguess affinity.
