Description:
An antibiotic commonly found in swine or poultry wastewater.

Text:
Few works involved in the interaction between 
aged MPs and HMs in environmentally relevant scenarios, e.g., 
swine or poultry wastewater, which contains a wide variety of con
taminants including ARGs, HMs, tetracycline (TC), dissolved or
ganic matters (DOMs), ammonia, and phosphate 13, 27. Swine and 
poultry effluents are rich in nutrients and thus often applied as a 
crucial secondary source for phosphorus recovery through struvite 
crystallization 2829. However, the interactions between aged MPs 
and HMs in the complex swine wastewater remain poorly under
stood, which is of significance to elucidate the transport and fate of 
the HMMP complexes in the effluents, particularly during the 
struvite recovery from swine wastewater 30.
