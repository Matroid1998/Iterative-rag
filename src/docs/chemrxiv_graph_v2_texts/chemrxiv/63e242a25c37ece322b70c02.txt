Produced through steam cracking of fossil-based naphtha.

They can be oligomerized into larger hydrocarbon chains to produce energydense 
fuels in the range C8  C16 suitable as jet fuels.1 Today, small conjugated dienes are mainly 
produced as byproducts in the production of ethylene through steamcracking of fossilbased 
naphtha.2,3 Thus, great attention has recently been directed to more sustainable routes to small 
biobased conjugated dienes through direct production from living organisms (e.g., microbes, 
algae, and plants) as well as from biomassderived sugars and plant oils.4 
The direct biotechnological production of C8  C16 hydrocarbons by microbes is 
possible,58 however, this process is limited due to the toxicity of these hydrocarbons as they 
accumulate in the cells and interfere with the cell membrane integrity.9 Besides this, the 
extraction and purification processes of large molecules require energyintensive procedures 
leading to increased production costs.
