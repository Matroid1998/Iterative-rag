Methane, a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric lifespan (12 years),
27
is responsible for about 30 of the rise in global temperatures, with current atmospheric
28
concentration more than twice preindustrial levels.13 As the major component of natural

gas commonly emitted across production, processing, and distribution sectors, mitigating

Description:
Emissions are stochastic, temporally and spatially variable with large emitters typically responsible for a substantial portion of unplanned emissions.

Several studies have shown that fugitive
33
(unplanned) methane emissions are stochastic, temporally and spatially variable with large
34
emitters typically responsible for a substantial portion of unplanned emissions.614 Continu
35
ous monitoring (CM) can improve emissions detection since these solutions nearcontinuously
36
monitor entire facilities (e.g. an entire wellpad), and can identify fugitive emissions faster
37
than existing survey methods (e.g. optical gas imaging camera surveys).15,16
38
A CM leak detection and quantification (LDAQ) solution is a technology that mea
39
sures ambient emissions concentration continuously using one, or a combination of, sensing

methodologies (e.g. tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, light detection and ranging,
41
etc.) and interprets readings using proprietary algorithms to generate actionable results (e.g.
