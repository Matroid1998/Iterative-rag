Description:
A solvent used in the generation of AAB by double cyclization.

of aryl 
moieties at position 3 of ABB through strainrelease remains 
undisclosed. With a general interest in 4membered carbo and 
heterocycles and their implication in drug discovery,13 we set 
out to establish a reliable method for the construction of such 
functionalized azetidine architectures. Our investigations started with the examination of the ring
opening reactions of ABB with ex situ generated arylGrignard 
reagents. In previous reports, AAB were generated in THF by 
double cyclization, employing an excess of phenyl lithium as 
base for deprotonation. First experiments were performed 
following these conditions (PhLi, THF), revealing however the 
formation of several byproducts.
