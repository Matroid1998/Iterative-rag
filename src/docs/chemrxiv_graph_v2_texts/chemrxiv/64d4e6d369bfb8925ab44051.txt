Description:
A family of archetypal chiral conjugated organic molecules formed from orthofused, angularly arranged benzene rings.

Different crystalline struc
tures, sometimes only with marginal changes to the crystal packing, can have considerably
different properties,1,911 and consequently polymorphism can be used as a design strategy
for highperformance organic electronics.9
Introducing chirality into organic semiconductors adds another level of functionality as it
enables the production of polarizationselective photodetectors,12 chiroptical switches,1315
and roomtemperature spintronic devices.16 nhelicenes form a family of archetypal chiral
conjugated organic molecules that are formed from orthofused, angularly arranged ben
zene rings, where n is the number of aromatic rings in the molecule.
