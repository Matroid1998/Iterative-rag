Description:
Acts as a hydride source and reductant in mHAT, enabling selective monoreduction of polyalkenes.

Text:
First, unactivated olefins react well in mHAT methods, enabled 
by the high reactivity (low bond dissociation energy) of the weak 
metalhydride bond.8b The hydride source and reductant in mHAT 
is a silane or borohydride,8a, 8b, 10 enabling selective monoreduction of 
a polyalkene via stoichiometry control, which would be more chal
lenging using a traditional hydrogenation in which the reductant is 1 
atm of H2 or solvent alcohol. Finally, the radical mechanism offers 
complementary selectivity relative to a typical transitionmetal cata
lyzed mechanism, with improved chemoselectivity and preservation 
of sensitive functional groups.8a, 8b, 10 
One problem with these singlecatalyst mHAT systems (Scheme 
1b) is that they require at least stoichiometric loading of an oxidant, 
such as tertbutyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), which is necessary to turn 
over the M2M3 cycle.
