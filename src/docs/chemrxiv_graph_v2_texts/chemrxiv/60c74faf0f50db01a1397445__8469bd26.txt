Description:
Species involved in iodine-based electrochemical energy storage devices, detectable by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

Text:
The 
16 
rather slow selfdischarge of iodinebased electrochemical energy storage devices is currently attributed to 
17 
immobile I3 and I5 confined in the narrow carbon pores of below 1 nm diameter7,8,18. However, based on the 
18 
known reaction mechanism on planar platinum electrodes16,17 and the use of battery electrodes with physically 
19 
impregnated I26,7, alternative electrodeposition of solid I2 in carbon nanopores ought to be considered. 20 
Resolving the mechanism requires in situ techniques with chemical and structural sensitivity for all involved 
21 
species in the nanoporous carbon. In situ Raman spectroscopy probes species in electrochemical cells2123 and 
22 
is sensitive to polyiodides (I3, I5)2427.
