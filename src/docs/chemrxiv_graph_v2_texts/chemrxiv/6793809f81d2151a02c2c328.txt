Description:
Compounds with a CCNR structure, related to ketenimines.

Text:
Since their first synthesis by Staudinger over a century 
ago,1 ketenimines, the nitrogen analogs of ketenes 
(CCNR), have transitioned from curiosities to key 
reagents in synthetic chemistry (Figure 1).2,3,4,5 The 
intrinsic polarization of the CCN bond and the ability of 
ketenimines to participate in nucleophilic, electrophilic, and 
pericyclic reactions make them excellent reagents for 
synthesizing complex molecules, particularly through 
cycloadditions that yield diverse heterocyclic frameworks. 3,6 The reactivity of ketenimines can be finetuned by 
modifying the substituents on the alkene or imine moiety, 
offering a high degree of synthetic flexibility.
