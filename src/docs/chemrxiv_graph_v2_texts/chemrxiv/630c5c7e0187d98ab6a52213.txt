Description:
A compound with nitrogen atom in the ring, often involved in electrophilic activation.

of a strong electronwithdrawing group on the ni
trogen atom of the pyridine rings.8 We succeeded in developing 
steric repulsioncontrolled 4positionselective trifluoromethyl
ation based on the electrophilic activation of pyridines using a 
bulky Lewis acid.9 However, these methods do not apply to tri
fluoromethylation at the C3 position of pyridine derivatives. Although this position is a potential reaction site with the CF3 
cation, such a reaction does not proceed under mild conditions 
because of the electron deficiency of the pyridine rings. Instead, 
conventional transformations at this position based on electro
philic aromatic substitutions require harsh conditions.4

Several synthetic methods for the preparation of 3trifluoro
methyl pyridine derivatives have been reported (Scheme 1). The
