Description:
A material that shows complex magnetism and magnetoresistance.

Text:
SrAg4Sb2 was synthesized in
2012 and later identified as a topological material by com
putational studies. 2023 It belongs to a family of layered
pnictides notable for their transport properties SrAg4As2
and EuAg4Sb2 show complex magnetism and magnetore
sistance; 2426 EuSn2As2 and EuIn2As2 are topological in
sulators; 27,28 and EuCd2As2 is one of the few magnetic
Weyl semimetals. 29 Metalmetal bonds control their struc
tures; Sn2 in EuSn2As2 has a stereochemical lone pair, so
the Sn atoms are staggered to minimize repulsions, while
EuIn2As2 has formal In2 which stabilizes its one 5s elec
tron by forming InIn bonds. Transition metals will intro
duce new electronic degrees of freedom through d orbital
interactions, and SrAg4Sb2 is an ideal starting point for
exploring this.

Description:
Subjected to calculations in the unrestricted KohnSham formalism with Eu spins aligned ferromagnetically.

Text:
Calculations on EuAg4Sb2 were performed
in the unrestricted KohnSham formalism with the Eu spins
aligned ferromagnetically, and a U correction of 6 eV was
applied to the f orbitals of Eu using the Dudarev formalism
