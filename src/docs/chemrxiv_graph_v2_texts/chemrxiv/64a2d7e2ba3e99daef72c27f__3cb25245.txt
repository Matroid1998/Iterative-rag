Description:
A donor moiety used in BP-based TADF compounds.

Within this model, most of the acceptors are derivatives of either acenaphtho1,2
bpyrazine8,9dicarbonitrile (APDC),12 heterocyclic quinoxaline6,7dicarbonitrile (QCN),13 11,12
dicyanodibenzoa,cphenazine (CNBPz),14 2,3dicyanodibenzof,hquinoxaline (CNBQx),15,16 or 
dibenzoa,cphenazine3,6dicarbonitrile 
(PZCN).17 
Nitrogendoped 
polycyclic 
aromatic 
hydrocarbons (NPAH), like dibenzoa,cphenazine (BP), have proved particularly popular as moieties 
in orangered TADF emitters (Figure S1). Zhao et al. first reported BPbased TADF compounds, 
containing onetothree 9,9dimethyl9,10dihydroacridine (DMAC) donor moieties (Figure S1). The 
orangered OLEDs with 3DMACBP, an emitter with three DMAC donors situated at the 3, 6, and 
11positions of the BP, showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 22.0 with an 
electroluminescence peaking at lEL  606 nm.18 Yang et al.
