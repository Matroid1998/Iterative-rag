Description:
An electron-rich intermediate formed from electron-deficient azines that reacts with electrophilic reagents.

Classical C3halogenation or 
C3nitration via electrophilic aromatic substitutions suffer from 
harsh reaction conditions, excessive use of the desired pyridine, 
and low regioselectivity (Scheme 1B).10,11 Over the last decades, 
peripheral editing methodologies have emerged as a powerful 
tool for the introduction of substituents at the C3 position, primarily 
employing nondirected transitionmetal catalysis12,13,14,15,16,17, 
directing groups,7 and most recently a dearomatization
aromatization strategy (Scheme 1B).9 In this approach, electron
deficient azines are transformed into electronrich intermediates 
(enamine, dienamine) that react with electrophilic reagents. Subsequent rearomatization leads to C3substituted pyridine 
derivatives. Along this line, Wang and coworkers reported an 
onepot 
boranecatalysed 
pyridine 
hydroboration 
tandem 
reactions.
