Compounds that include phosphinylidenes and are of biological and pharmaceutical importance.

Text:
Phosphinylidenes are a family of organophosphorus compounds that are of biological 
and pharmaceutical importance.13 They are also most commonly employed as ancillary 
ligands in homogenous catalysis.4,5 These include phosphinates, Hphosphonates, H
phosphinates and secondary phosphine oxides. Such compounds can exhibit a 
prototropic (i.e., proton migration from one atom to another) tautomerism process 
involving structures with a tetracoordinate pentavalent phosphorus P(V) and a trivalent 
phosphorus P(III) atom (see Scheme 1A). Due to the availability of a free lone pair of 
electrons, the P(III) hydroxide form is known to coordinate with the metal in transition 
metal complexes. However, the P(V) oxide form is known to be the most stable species 
and the tautomeric equilibrium displayed in Scheme 1A is strongly shifted toward P(V) if 
the R were electrondonating groups.
