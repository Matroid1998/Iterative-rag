Description:
An olefin activated by an electron-withdrawing group at the carbon atom.

In more recent years, TCIs that form reversible covalent bond have
also been actively pursued.69 Developing computational protocols that can make accu
rate, reliable, and fast prediction of reactivities and reversibilities of covalent warheads
can signicantly reduce medicinal chemistry efforts. Most FDAapproved TCIs make use of warheads based on an acrylamide group, which
is an olen activated by an electronwithdrawing group (EWG, see Fig. 1ab) at the  car
bon atom.
