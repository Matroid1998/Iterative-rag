Description:
Promising for laccase immobilization.

Text:
Yet, a major setback of applying free laccase is the fast 
48 
loss of enzymatic catalytic performance and stability when encountering environmental factors 
49 
such as varied pH and fluctuating temperatures.4 To address that, the enzyme immobilization 
50 
technique has been employed, which entails attaching, crosslinking, or entrapping enzymes onto 
51 
a solid substrate or within a porous support matrix.2 Undergoing immobilization is expected to 
52 
render several advantages over free laccases (1) improved tolerance to harsh environmental 
53 
conditions, including extreme temperatures and pH levels;5 (2) easy recovery of enzymes from 
54 
treated wastewater or contaminated sites;6 (3) retained and augmented catalytic ability for 
55 
targeted compound degradation.7 To successfully synthesize powerful immobilized laccases, 
56 
selecting the appropriate supporting materials is a crucial aspect.8 
57 
We envision that boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), also known as white graphene, are 
58 
promising for laccase immobilization.

Description:
Consists of a few atomic thickness layers with B atoms and N atoms substituting for C atoms, resembling graphene structures.

Text:
BNNSs consist of a few atomic thickness layers of bulk 
59 
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)9 and resemble structures of graphene, with B atoms and N atoms 
60 
substituting for C atoms. BNNSs offer several advantages for enzyme immobilization and 
61 
environmental applications. BNNSs showed higher surface areas than hBN (BNNSs 
62 
2,600 m2 g1; bulk hBN 10 m2 g1).10 Additionally, the remarkable chemical stability of 
63 
BNNSs makes them suitable for use in a wide range of environments.11,12 Their high 
64 
biocompatibility13 reduces concerns of secondary contamination. In order to enable better 
65 
enzyme attachment on BNNSs, the exfoliation and functionalization process during the BNNSs
