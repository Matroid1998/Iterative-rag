Description:
Used in the form of dye-doped silica nanoparticles for biological applications due to its biocompatibility.

Other inorganic LNPs such as upconverting 
nanoparticles (UCNPs)911 have also attracted a lot of attention. Similarly to QDs, they 
combine excellent photostability, narrowband emission and long luminescence lifetimes, 
which allows for timegated detection. UNCPs are also major players in the currently 
blooming field of triplettriplet annihilation. While these advantages are powerful ways 
to discriminate the fluorescent signal of interest from the endogenous autofluorescence 
of biological materials, it is a limitation for dynamic imaging of fast events. Moreover, 
the brightness of UCNPs is currently limited and their potential toxicity remains an 
issue.12 Comparatively, the acknowledged biocompatibility of hybrid nanoparticles such 
as dyedoped silica nanoparticles has made this class of LNPs extremely popular tools 
for biological applications.
