of TmPyPB as an additional electron transport layer 
enhances charge carrier confinement and reduces nonradiative losses, as evidenced by both 
optical measurements and electronic device analysis. Our work culminates in the successful 
demonstration of solution processed PeLEDs with ultraviolet emission below 400 nm, surpassing 
the spectral limitations of previously reported devices while achieving reasonable EQE values. These findings not only highlight the potential of 2D perovskites in nextgeneration 
optoelectronics but also pave the way for further exploration into novel device architectures and 
material compositions, with the ultimate goal of realizing highly efficient, stable, and 
commercially viable ultraviolet electroluminescent devices. Methods 

Materials 
Phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl, 98), phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr, 98), 
and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999) were purchased from SigmaAldrich.
