Description:
A high-Z transition metal complex (TMC) that acts as a CT chromophore.

Text:
When the lifetime of the LEES is sufficiently long, the metastable CT
chromophore can trigger elementary reactions in solution and on surfaces (Gust2008). Widespread CT chromophores are highZ TM complexes (TMC), such as Ru(bpy)32
(Prier2013). Recent progress has delivered lowZ TMC that exhibit a LEES of CT character,
rather than the more common metalcentered (MC) character (Liu2013). The deactivation
from the highenergy excited state (HEES) manifold to the LEES then stands as the
predominant loss channel inherently limiting the yields and efficiencies attainable via
molecular approaches to photonversion with CT chromophores (Gust2008, Cotic2024). Overcoming this hurdle is a complex task, which is engaging increasing efforts across
scientific fields (Wegner2018). A promising strategy consists in utilizing the intramolecular
CT before relaxation to the LEES.
