Description:
Channels that control potassium flows across biological cell membranes.

Text:
Potassium (K) channels are asymmetric homotetrameric 
transmembrane proteins that control Kflows across biological cell membranes1, 2 . In humans, Kirs (K inwardly rectifying) belong to a family of  400 ion channel 
genes whose genetic mutations are often implicated in diverse cardiovascular, 
skeletal muscle or synaptic neuronal functions or channelopathies. Distinct 
mutations on the Kircoding genes can affect the electrical excitability 3 of nerve or 
muscle cells, channel gating, conductance, ion selectivity, andor signal 
transduction.
