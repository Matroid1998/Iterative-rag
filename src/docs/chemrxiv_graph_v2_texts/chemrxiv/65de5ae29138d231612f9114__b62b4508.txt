For instance, using a chemical oxidative method, Gautam et al. synthesized PNNiO composites 
49

(PNNiO) by insitu polymerization. The asprepared hybrid electrode showed a specific capacitance 
50

of 623 F g1 at 1 A g1 current density with capacitance retention of 89 after 5000 cycles at a current 
51

density of 20 A g1 12. Similarly, Kenesi et al. reported a ternary composite of PN and Cadmium
