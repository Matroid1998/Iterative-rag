Description:
A pseudoaromatic dicarboxylic acid obtained from the microbial conversion of lignin.

Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant renewable feedstock which can potentially be used for
the sustainable production of fuels and highvalue chemicals, thereby reducing dependence
upon petroleum and contributing to decarbonization.1,2 A pathway for biomass valorization
is through the conversion of lignin, one of the three primary components of biomass, to
diverse bioproducts with rich functional groups.3 One product that can be obtained from
the microbial conversion of lignin is 2pyrone4,6dicarboxylic acid (PDC), a pseudoaromatic
dicarboxylic acid.4 PDC shows promise as a precursor for the production of bioplastics
and epoxy adhesives.5,6 However, the production of PDC requires its separation from the
aqueous fermentation broth utilized in microbial conversion processes.
