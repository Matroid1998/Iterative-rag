Description:
A redox-active ligand used to promote conductivity in porous frameworks.

Sev
eral strategies have been employed to enhance their con
ductivity, such as redoxmatching of the building blocks,
the use of mixedvalence metal nodes and ligands, or the
introduction of conducting guests into the pore 2226. Engineering highperforming MOFs for a desired applica
tion involves searching the vast configuration space of metal
nodes, linkers and ligands. Among the large list of redox
active ligands used to promote conductivity in porous frame
works, dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq) and its derivatives
stand promising to engender mixedvalence MOFs due to
their ability to exist in three different redox states through
aromaticquionidaromatic transitions (Figure 1) 27. The
3charge state is a radical and thus carries a spin com
pared to the diamagnetic 2and 4states.
