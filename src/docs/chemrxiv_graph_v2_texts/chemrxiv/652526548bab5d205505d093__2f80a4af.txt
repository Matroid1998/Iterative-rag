Description:
Multiple nonstoichiometric phases synthesized in the past several decades.

Text:
The rare earth polychalcogenides demonstrate a number of interesting electronic and struc
tural properties related to their compositional exibility and layered structure multiple
nonstoichiometric LnCh2x phases have been synthesised in the past several decades14 and
the compound family draws comparisons with the transition metal dichalcogenides with their
tunability. While the lanthanum polychalcogenides do not exhibit the magnetic behaviour
associated with the valence 4f states later in the rare earth series, since superconductivity
was found in the intermediate phases between La2Se3 and La3Se4,5 the lanthanum selenides
have been no less popular, and represent a fertile ground for solidstate materials research.
