3D voxel, a volume element in 3D space that is analogous to a pixel in 2D space, has been 
45 
developed as a descriptor for accurate prediction of gas uptake in zeolites.13 For predicting 
46 
electronic properties such as band gap, graph neural networks (GNNs) such as Crystal Graph 
47 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN)14 and MatErials Graph Network (MEGNET)15 have 
48 
shown high performance. Also, various descriptors have been developed including geometric, 
49 
chemical, topological features, revised autocorrelations (RAC)16 and smooth overlap of atomic 
50 
positions (SOAP)17. Recently, MOFTransformer18, a multimodal pretraining Transformer, has
