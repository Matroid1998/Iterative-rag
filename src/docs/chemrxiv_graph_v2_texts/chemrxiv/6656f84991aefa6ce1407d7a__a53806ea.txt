Description:
A chemotherapeutic agent whose treatment can lead to chemoresistant tumor cells.

Text:
Moreover, 5FU treatment frequently results in the 
development of chemoresistant tumour cells.3 Use of carrier materials could ideally allow for a 
targeted release in the human body, increasing cytotoxicity while at the same reducing the 
amount of drug required for effective treatment, thereby limiting side effects and resistance 
development.4 The variety of materials that have been investigated as potential 5FU delivery 
vehicles is the subject of dedicated review articles.46 Organic materials that have been 
proposed for this purpose include polymer microspheres7 and functionalised block copolymers 
that release 5FU under UV irradiation,8 among many other systems.
