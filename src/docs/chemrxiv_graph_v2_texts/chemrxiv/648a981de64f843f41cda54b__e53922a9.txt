Description:
Monomeric species formed via comproportionation and oxidative addition with small monophosphine ligands.

Text:
Notably, 
small monophosphine ligands have been known to form 
monomeric (PR3)nNiIX (n  2 or 3) species via compropor
tionation 
and 
oxidative 
addition,23,24 
but 
dimeric 
(PR3)NiIX2 complexes bearing larger phosphine congeners 
were unknown prior to a 2022 report from our group.25,26 
This is in stark contrast to precedent for PdI, for which com
plexes of the type (PR3)PdIX2 are longknown27 and have 
been thoroughly studied by Schoenebeck and cowork
ers.28,29 As precedent for bisligated (PR3)2NiI species has 
shown that such species are capable of catalytic cycle 
(re)entry, 9,1416 the structure and speciation of monoligated 
(PR3)NiI complexes warrants further investigation.
