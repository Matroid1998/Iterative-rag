Description:
Increases the electron-donating strength of the substrate, lowering its oxidation potential.

It has been shown both experimentally and theoretically that an increase in the electrondonating
strength of the substrate lowers its oxidation potential, which, in turn, lowers the barrier of the PCET
reaction on the S1 potential energy surface of the complex. 12, 13 Nonadiabatic dynamic simulations
performed for such complexes support this observation, too. 12, 14 A similar experiment, performed
on hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) dissolved in water and in methanol, confirms the relation between
the electrondonating strength of the substrate and the yield of the PCET reaction. 15
The photooxidation of alcohols is generally representative of the photooxidation of organic mat
ter, 16, 17 with potential applications in various fields, such as organic synthesis and renewable energy
conversion.
