Description:
A substituent that did not show a positive effect in the trials.

Text:
Whereas, an analogous positive effect was not observed for either bromine or fluorine substituents, as exemplified by the trials 
performed with donors F and H. 
Using the newlydesigned donor G, further screening of the reaction conditions identified 1,2DCE as the best solvent for the 
photochemical arylation process (4 obtained in 75 yield, entry 3, Figure 2b). Under these conditions, the loading of the amine 
donor can be reduced to 10 mol, with minimal erosion of the product yield (entry 4). When the lightdriven reaction was irradi
ated with green LEDs (max centered at 525 nm), traces of product 4 were detected; while performing the protocol in the dark 
resulted in no reactivity  even upon heating the reaction mixture at 60 C  and the starting materials were recovered.
