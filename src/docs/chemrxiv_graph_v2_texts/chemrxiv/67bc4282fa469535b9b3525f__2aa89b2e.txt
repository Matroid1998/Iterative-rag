Description:
Studied for its effect on contact ion pair formation and HFCs.

Text:
Smentowski then reported 1 formation using 
Lithium, Sodium and Potassium in liquid ammonia solution at 50 C,33 whose HFCs were comparable to 
those measured in other solvents electrochemically.30 Gross et al., performed a detailed study of the effect 
of the solvent polarity on the contact (separated) ion pair formation and the HFCs of 1X (X  Li, Na, 
K, Rb, Cs).34,35 They conclude that the measured EPR linewidths are directly proportional to the ionic radius
