Description:
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is highly dependent on redox-active transition metals.

Text:
The initial source of the reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production is highly dependent on redoxactive transition metals, mainly copper(II) ions, 
which create complexes with A.7 Until recently, the majority of chemical studies on the 
formation and properties of complexes concerned mainly the canonical A(1x) (where x  16, 
28, 40 and 42) peptides.
