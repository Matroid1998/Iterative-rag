Description:
Used as a photocatalyst in multiple reactions.

Text:
In the past few decades, the field of photocatalysis at
tracted much attention among synthetic chemists. Photoca
talysis, as a method of activation of organic molecules, relies 
on the electron or energy transfer between photoexcited 
catalysts and substrates, and allows bond formation and 
breakage under mild conditions. Though the most used pho
tocatalysts  ruthenium or iridium polypyridyl complexes  
have already proved their efficiency in multiple reactions1
5, their high cost, laborious synthesis, and generation of 
heavyatom wastes prompted chemists towards the search 
and development of new photocatalytic systems615. Among 
them, there are several examples of application of metal
free organic chromophores as photocatalysts in the reac
tions of oxidation1620, reductive dehalogenation21, CC bond 
formation2226 and others2730.
