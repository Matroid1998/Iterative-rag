(S
309309) is an antiobesity drug that was developed by Shionogi  Co., Ltd. S309309 
has an inhibitory effect on monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2), which makes 
it useful for treating diseases such as obesity.1,2) Three isoforms of MGAT have been 
identified MGAT1, MGAT2, and MGAT3. Of these, MGAT2 and MGAT3 are highly 
expressed in the small intestine, where they are thought to be involved in fat absorption.
