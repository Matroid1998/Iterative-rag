Description:
Has an excited-state lifetime of 150 ps when excited near the excitation threshold, significantly longer than isolated adenine.

Adenine in the gas
phase has an excitedstate lifetime of the order of single picoseconds or less depending on
the exact measurement technique,(4, 2125) with similar lifetimes reported in solution. (26)
The lowest excited singlet state of adenine exhibits n character and significant 1n1
mixing after initial excitation. (2631) Adenine undergoes aromatic ring puckering
associated with C2H tilting and outofplane deformation at the C2N3 position to reach an
S1S0 conical intersection (CI) with a barrier of about 0.1 eV, enabling relaxation to the
electronic ground state. In contrast, Lobsiger et al. found isolated 2AP to have an
excitedstate lifetime of 150 ps when excited near the excitation threshold, which is
significantly longer than in the case of isolated adenine.
