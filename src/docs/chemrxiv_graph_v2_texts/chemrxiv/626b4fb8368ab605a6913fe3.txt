Description:
A reference point in the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) used in electrochemical potential measurements.

Text:
The Computational Hydrogen
Electrode (CHE) approach considers entirely protoncoupled electron transfer (PCET) steps
and derives these electrochemical potentials simply from reference to the Standard Hydrogen
Electrode (SHE) at which these are in equilibrium with Hydrogen gas.19,20 By again con
sidering scaling and BEP relations for PCET steps,21 the full potential and pH dependence
of all intermediates formation energies is accessible from often only a single or two forma
tion energies.22 Again, this descriptorbased approach has been used from highthroughput
screening using machine learning2325 or interpretation of experimental ndings.22
Due to the origination of this approach from surface science, the formation energies of
reaction intermediates even in electrochemistry have been calculated on simple solid surface
