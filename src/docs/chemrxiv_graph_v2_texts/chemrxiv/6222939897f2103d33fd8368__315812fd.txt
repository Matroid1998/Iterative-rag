Description:
A metal-organic framework whose isomer population affects cluster formation.

Text:
of ions (Na, F) and the relative population of MIL101(Cr) half
secondary building unit (halfSBU) isomers has a strong influence on the cluster formation process. In more detail, the shape, 
size, nucleation and growth rates, crystallinity and short and longrange order largely vary depending on the synthesis con
ditions. We evaluate these properties as they naturally emerge when interpreting selfassembly of MOF nuclei as the time
evolution of an undirected graph. Solutioninduced conformational complexity and ionic concentration have a dramatic effect 
on the morphology of clusters emerging during assembly, such diversity is captured by key features of the graph representa
tion. More precisely, pure solvent leads to rapid formation of a small number of large clusters, while ions result in slower 
nucleation through smaller clusters in water.
