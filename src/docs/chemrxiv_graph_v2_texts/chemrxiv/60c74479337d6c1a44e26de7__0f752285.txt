Description:
A spin isomer of hydrogen used in parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) for hyperpolarization.

There 
are three significant drawbacks to this technique (1) it is 
prohibitively 
expensive, 
(2) 
complex 
cryogenic 
equipment is required to reach 1.4 K, and (3) the 
hyperpolarized material is delivered in batchmode, with 
tens of minutes of preparation time required between 
sample deliveries. PHIP (parahydrogen induced polarization) is an 
alternative hyperpolarization modality which involves 
chemical addition of hydrogen gas enriched in the para 
spin isomer to a substrate molecule 2,12. PHIP is 
approximately 12 orders of magnitude less expensive 
than dDNP, and can produce hyperpolarized products 
with a much higher duty cycle because it only requires 
chemical reaction with hydrogen gas.
