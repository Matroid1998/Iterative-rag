Next ozone detemplation reports
concerned mesoporous materials rather than zeolites.11 With the new century, the use of O3 to
remove the occluded OSDA was rediscovered. For instance, Gilbert et al. reported the removal of
tetrapropylammonium (TPA) from silicalite1 (MFI), although at temperatures rather high (500 C
for the total removal).12 However, Heng et al. used O3 at 200 C to remove TPA from MFI
