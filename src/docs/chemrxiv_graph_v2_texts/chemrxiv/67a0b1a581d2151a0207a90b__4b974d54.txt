Photocatalysis offers a promising route for the scalable conversion of sunlight to hydrogen or other 
26 
solar fuels (Pinaud et al., 2013; Schneidewind, 2022; Goto et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019; Tran et al., 
27 
2012; Gunawan et al. 2024). Various particulate photocatalysts for water splitting, largely based on 
28 
semiconductors such as TiO2 (Li et al., 2015; Eidsvg et al., 2021), SrTiO3 (Patial et al., 2020; Avcolu 
29 
et al., 2023) or C3N4 (Dankawu et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2017) have been developed, but the methods 
30 
for their activity evaluation vary widely within the literature.
