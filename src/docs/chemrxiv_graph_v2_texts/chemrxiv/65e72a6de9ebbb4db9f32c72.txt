Description:
A state-of-the-art catalyst for nitrogen reduction reactions.

Text:
HEAs have been shown to hold great potential for catalyst dis
covery,3037,4150 having been investigated for many different re
actions,48,5163 including electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction.6466
However, previous investigations for N2RR on HEAs have either
been experimental or have not calculated the dissociation barriers
for the reaction. Knowing the activation energy is of utmost impor
tance for properly evaluating activity compared to stateoftheart
catalysts like Fe and Ru. The aim of this paper is to investigate highentropy alloys as a
discovery platform for N2RR catalysts using theory and simula
tions.
