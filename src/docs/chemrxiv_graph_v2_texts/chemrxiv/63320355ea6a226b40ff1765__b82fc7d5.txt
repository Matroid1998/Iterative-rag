Description:
Typically converted to ethylene via steam cracking.

Tremendous growth in unconventional gas exploration has increased U.S. natural gas 
liquids (NGL) production, as unconventional tight oil and wet gas plays generate significant 
volume of NGLs. Recovery of these NGLs  mostly ethane, propane and butane  is typically 
achieved cryogenically via a turboexpander process resulting in a bottom liquid stream and a top 
methanerich stream1. Ethane is typically converted to ethylene, a key building block in the

chemical industry, via steamcracking which is the most energyintensive U.S. chemical 
manufacturing process2. Therefore, ethylene production has been highlighted as a candidate for 
process intensification to significantly reduce this energy consumption3.
