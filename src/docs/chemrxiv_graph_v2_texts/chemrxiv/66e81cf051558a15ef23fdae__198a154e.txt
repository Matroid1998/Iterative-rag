Description:
Molecular catalysts with highly specialized ligand scaffolds for CO2 reduction reactions.

Text:
In this regard, the small size of the 
molecular systems and the fact that they can be tuned with 
a level of atomic precision offer potential advantages over 
the related biological5 and heterogeneous catalysts812 for 
CO2RR. However, despite advances in the development of 
molecular catalysts with highly specialized ligand scaffolds, 
including cyclams,1317 porphyrins,1826 phthalocyanines,9, 27 
corroles,2829 and polypyridines,3037 the factors that lead to 
high product selectivity, low overpotential, high turnover 
number, and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes while 
avoiding offpathway HER during homogenous CO2RR, are 
not well understood. Detailed efforts have also been investigated in 
understanding the role of the ancillary ligands in the 
catalytic cycles for multielectron, multiproton redox
