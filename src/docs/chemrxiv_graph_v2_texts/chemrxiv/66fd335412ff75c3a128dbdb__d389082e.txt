Description:
An ideal oxidant used in highly efficient selective oxidation of alcohols under homogenous catalytic systems.

2022 First, the ideal newly developed oxidation processes are expected to be carried 
out selectively with green, cheap, sustainable, and nontoxic oxidants, to replace the 
abovementioned oxidants. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 23, 24 and molecular oxygen 
(O2) 25, 26 have become the ideal oxidants since they not only meet the above
mentioned ideal oxidants requirements but also with the advantage of being safe, atom
efficient, and producing water as a byproduct. Based on these, several groups have 
developed highly efficient selective oxidation of alcohols with O2 and H2O2 under 
homogenous catalytic systems.
