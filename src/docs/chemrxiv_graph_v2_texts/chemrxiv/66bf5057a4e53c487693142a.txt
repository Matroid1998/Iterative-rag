Description:
Radicals used in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments at 80 K.

Here, we illustrate the predictive strength of singlespin vector
model by comparing analytical calculations with experimental DNP results at 9.8 GHz15 MHz on
trityl radicals at 80 K. The second case operates in the highpower regime, where we combine the
underlying singlespin vector design principles with numerical nonlinear optimization to optimize
the balance between the linear terms and the bilinear Fourier coefficients in a figure of merit func
tion. We demonstrate, numerically and experimentally, a broadband DNP pulse sequence PLATO
(PoLarizAtion Transfer via nonlinear Optimization) with a bandwidth of 80 MHz and optimized
for microwave field a with maximum (peak) amplitude of 32 MHz.
