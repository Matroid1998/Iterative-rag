Description:
Aromatic compounds containing carbon-carbon bonds used as aryl electrophiles.

Text:
More recently, aromatic compounds 
containing carboncarbon bonds, such as carboxylic acids, 
esters, amides, and nitriles, as well as alkanols have also be
gun to be used as aryl electrophiles.915 In spite of this pro
gress, aromatic ketones are considered to be some of the 
most challenging functionalized aromatic compounds to en
gage in this reaction paradigm.
