Description:
Forms a tetrahedron around a nitrogen atom in quaternary ammonium salts.

However, the pursuit of a general
approach to achieving exceptional enantioselectivity in asymmet
ric ion pairing catalysis faces notable challenges stemming from
the inherent directionless nature associated with ion pairing in
teractions, in contrast to the discernible behaviour exhibited by
hydrogen bonding and covalent interactions.1,311 Enantioselec
tive ion pairing catalysis encompasses a diverse array of small
organic molecules, amongst which quaternary ammonium salts
have emerged as the most extensively studied class of chiral
phasetransfer catalysts (PTCs). These catalysts feature a nitrogen atom positioned at the cen
tre of a tetrahedron formed by carbon atoms, with three sterically
hindered faces, resulting in a single accessible face for anion inter
action, thereby facilitating the establishment of ion pairs (Figure
1 a).
