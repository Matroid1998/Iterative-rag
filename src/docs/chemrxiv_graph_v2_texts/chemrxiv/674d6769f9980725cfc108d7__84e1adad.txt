Description:
Used in asymmetric 42 annulation reactions.

Text:
The Murakami group24 reported the 1st 
asymmetric 42 annulation with allenes, and the Garg group25 later developed a cyclic allene as 
an effective coupling partner, affording pointchiral heterocycles (Scheme 1c). The group of Tan 
and Liu7 reported in 2015 an atroposelective coupling between benzotriazinones and a sterically 
hindered alkyne, affording CC chiral biaryls. Very recently, the Liu group26 extended this 42 
annulation to the synthesis of axially chiral NN biaryls by employing benzotriazinones bearing a
