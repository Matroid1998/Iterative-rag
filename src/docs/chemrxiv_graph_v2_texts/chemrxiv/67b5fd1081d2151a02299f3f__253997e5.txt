Re
cently, the groups of Schelter and Zuo have developed ce
riumbased photosensitizers13, 14 and impressive method
ologies involving the formation of coloured Ce4ligand 
complexes through the reaction of CeCl3 and chloride salts 
or alcoholate ligands, respectively.9, 1518 Upon excitation by 
visible or near UVlight, these complexes undergo oxidative 
accumulation, yielding chlorine or alkoxy radicals.19, 20 
These electrophilic species selectively abstract hydrogen at
oms from complex molecules, and the resulting nucleophilic 
carboncentred radicals are successfully trapped by deriva
tives of ditertbutyl (azodicarboxylate), hypothesized to 
close the catalytic cycle of Ce3Ce4.21 However, in some 
conditions where both CeCl3 and short alcohols were used 
as the catalytic system, the nature of the eventual active hy
drogen atom transfer (HAT) species remains unresolved 
and is still under discussion despite numerous mechanistic 
investigations conducted by both groups (Scheme 1).10, 17,
