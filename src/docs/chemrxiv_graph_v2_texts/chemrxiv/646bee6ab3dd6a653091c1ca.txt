Description:
An element used in lithium-ion battery cathode materials.

Text:
Since the discovery that transition metal oxides can reversibly store lithium through a 
reaction mechanism termed conversiontype reaction1, a large body of work has been 
accumulated on metal salts and their derivative compounds largely due to the possibility of 
exploiting multipleelectron transfers per redox centers that these metals can offer27. Furthermore, if a reliable recycling program becomes available for current lithiumion battery 
(LIB) cathode materials, this can easily be applied to these transition metal salt electrodes. However, these materials have not yet lived up to their expectations. They still suffer significant 
capacity fade and low power density, especially micrometersize particles1,8,9.
