Description:
Used in nuclear fuel reprocessing.

This
complex garners attention not only in introductory chem
istry texts but also due to its environmental impact of
SF6 6, 7, notable oxidation properties when M is a
thirdrow transition metal 810) and UF6 in nuclear
fuel reprocessing 11, 12. A comprehensive overview of
the history and physical and chemical properties of MF6
is provided in ref 13. Traditional ligand field theory, developed for light el
ements, does not adequately capture the intricate elec
tronic behaviors exhibited by heavy transition metals. The relativistic effect is significant when describing the
chemistry of heavy elements 1419.
