Description:
Molecular capsules that act as hosts to bind guest reactants or smaller catalysts.

Synthetic chemists have long sought to mimic the catalytic effect of the enzyme environment 
around an active site. One promising direction involves the use of a molecular capsule or cage, 
acting as a host to bind a guest reactant or smaller catalyst, in the same way an enzyme binds 
a small molecule substrate or utilizes a catalytic residue in the active site. Since the initial discovery 
of crownethers1, cryptands,2,3 and other molecular capsules, the field of supramolecular chemistry 
has expanded significantly as larger and more elaborate hosts are designed, including metal
organic cages.46 Metalorganic cages are composed of metal vertices and organic, often aromatic 
linkers.
