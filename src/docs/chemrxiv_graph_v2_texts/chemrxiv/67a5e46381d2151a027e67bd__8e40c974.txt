Description:
A product of PET cleavage by PETase.

In the last years, an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to conventional 
methods has been offered by enzymatic degradation.9 Several bacterial enzymes were discovered able to 
cleave the polymeric plastic chains, including cutinases, lipases, and esterases, and grouped in the family 
of PEThydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs).10,11 A breakthrough in this field occurred in 2016 with the discovery 
of a bacterium, named Ideonella Sakaiensis 201F6 that used PET as a major nutrient thanks to the 
secretion of two hydrolases PETase and MHETase.12 Working synergistically, PETase cleaves the PET 
chains mainly into mono(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (MHET), bis(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET), 
terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG; Figure 1A), whereas MHETase completes the process, 
converting MHET and BHET into their minimal chemical moieties.
