Description:
Ligands that can act as both tridentate and bidentate ligands, exhibiting hemilabile character.

Text:
This binding mode 
was confirmed by XRD in case of IIa and by 19F195Pt HMBC 
in case of IIb. In other words, the pincer sulfonium ligands 
that we prepared could act as both tridentate and bidentate 
ligands in comparable complexes, thus exhibiting a hemila
bile character which renders them even more appealing. Chart 1 Sulfoniumbased pincer ligands and its Pt(II) com
plexes reported previously.
