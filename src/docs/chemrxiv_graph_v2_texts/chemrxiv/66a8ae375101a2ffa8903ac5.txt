of fluorine in compounds plays a crucial role in drug development as it greatly influences their final
pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties. Due to the increasing prevalence of fluorine in FDAapproved drugs in recent
years, identifying the underlying mechanisms driving their chemical transformations has become crucial in the drug
discovery landscape. 19F NMR spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique that allows for the examination of
fluorinecontaining compounds, offering valuable information about their structure, dynamics, and reactivity. Consequently, this technique has become a cornerstone in the mechanistic evaluation of fluorinecontaining chemical
transformations. NMR spectra can be interpreted through the leveraging of Density Functional Theory (DFT), an ab initio
modeling method that can be harnessed for the prediction of NMR chemical shifts.

Description:
Atoms whose features in models are derived from their local three-dimensional structural environments.

However, the screening of compounds
and discovery of feasible drug candidates is severely limited due to the computational cost of DFT. Here, we present a
machine learning approach to accelerate the prediction of DFTcalculated 19F NMR chemical shifts. The fluorine atoms
features in the models were derived from their local threedimensional structural environments, representing their
neighboring atoms within a radius of n  away from the given fluorine atom in the compound. A comparative analysis of
thirteen regression models was conducted using features extracted from 501 fluorinated compounds in our laboratorys
chemical inventory. The target chemical shift values were calculated using DFT with the quantum chemistry software
ORCA.
