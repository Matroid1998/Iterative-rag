Description:
Coordination polymers showing both two-photon absorption and second harmonic generation responses.

For instance, the Ag(AnPy)2Xn CPs (AnPy 
 4(2(anthracen9yl)vinyl)pyridine; X  BF4, NO3) show both 2PA and SHG responses,2 
while the analog, Zn2(benzoate)4(An2Py)2n (An2Py  9,10bis(4pyridylethenyl)anthracene) 
CP, even exhibits three simultaneous phenomena as multiphotonexcited photoluminescence, 
SHG and THG.3 Additionally, the ZnX2(tpatpy)xH2On CPs (tpatpy  N,Ndiphenyl4
2,26,2terpyridin4yl; X  I, Cl, Br) demonstrate photoluminescence, SHG, and 2PA, 
making them suitable for use in multichannel NLO imaging technology.4 Another chiral CP, 
Zn2(SFTB)(DEF)(H2O)
