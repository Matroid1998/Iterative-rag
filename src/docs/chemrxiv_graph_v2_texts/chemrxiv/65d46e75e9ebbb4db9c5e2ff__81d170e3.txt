Description:
A p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.17 eV.

Text:
The ptype semiconductor copper oxide (Cu2O) has a band gap of 2.17 eV.8 Furthermore,
the conduction band edge position is wellsuited for the electron transfer reactions associ
ated with the formation of H2.9 Unfortunately, Cu2O electrodes undergo photodegradation
in aqueous environments due to the position in the band gap of the redox potentials for the
reduction and oxidation of Cu2O.1012 Thus, Cu2O electrodes are unsuited for PEC devices. 2
