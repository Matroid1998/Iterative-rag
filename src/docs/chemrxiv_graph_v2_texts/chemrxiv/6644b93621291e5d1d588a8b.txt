Nitrogen oxide (NOx  NO  NO2) emissions are directly harmful to human health and a critical participant 
34 
in ozone formation. Many North American cities already have NOxlimited ozone formation during the 
35 
warm season13, and the remaining cities should have primarily NOxlimited conditions in the coming years4. 36 
Further reducing ozone pollution in metropolitan areas will therefore require improved quantification of 
37 
NOx emissions. Exposure to NOx is also directly associated with asthma exacerbation in vulnerable 
38 
groups5,6 and premature death7,8. One major limitation of our current observing network is the inability to 
39 
accurately quantify NOx emissions on a sectorbysector basis in a timely fashion, with the exception of 
40 
continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) on electricity generating units.
