Description:
Accounts for about three-fourths of total greenhouse gas emissions.

Text:
1.1 Background. The greenhouse gases emitted as a result of the development industries
have been increasing, proved by an average temperature increase of 0.32F (0.18 C) per decade
since 1981. From 1990 to 2015, the net greenhouse gas emissions from human activities
increased by 43, with CO2 accounting for about threefourths of total emissions, which
increased by 51 percent (Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 2023). 1.2 Carbon Capture and Storage. Consequently, technologies have been introduced to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mainly CO2, from fossil fuel industries.
