Description:
A two-dimensional material derived from three-dimensional graphite.

Text:
The nding of reducing the dimension from three
dimensional (3D) graphite to twodimensional(2D)1
graphene
suggests
the
further
possibilities
of
low
dimensional materials. Further, several 2D materi
als like hBN2, 3, SiC4, phosphorene5, Transitional
metal dichalcogenides6, MXenes7 have been studied
theoretically and experimentally. Similarly, the Study
of Low dimensional carbon allotropes zerodimensional
(0D) fullerenes8 ,1D nanotubes9 shows nobel results. Moreover, recent studies show that by reducing the size of
the material, miniaturization of any technological device
is possible10, 11.The 1D nanowires are a very good ex
ample of the ultimate conductor miniaturization. These
nanoscale systems reveal novel electronic, optical, me
chanical, and transport properties as a result of the ex
treme carrier connement.
