Description:
Also known as di2ethylhexyl phathalate, it is used to soften PVC.

Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is by far the most plasticized polymer, with approximately 
90 of all plasticizers used to manufacture PVC products 14. Plasticizers are utilized to 
reduce the brittleness and increase the flexibility of PVC through the lowering of glass transition 
temperatures (Tgs). This enables the manufacture of food wrappers, medical products, such as 
transfusion bags and associated tubing, and many other products, such as toys, electrical 
insulation, and furniture. Since PVC is thoroughly integrated into the medical and food 
industries, it is important to use safe materials that will not harm us when medicines and 
nutrients packaged with plasticized PVC are absorbed and processed by our bodies. Currently, 
di2ethylhexyl phathalate (DEHP), also known as dioctylphthalte (DOP), is the primary 
plasticizer used to soften PVC.
