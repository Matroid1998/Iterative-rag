Description:
Compounds produced by Colobognatha millipedes.

Text:
Millipedes (class Diplopoda) produce a myriad of defensive chemicals, including hydrogen cyanide, oxidized 
aromatics, and alkaloids (Shear 2015). These compounds are stored in high concentrations in ozadenes (or rapidly 
generated from biological inert precursors) and the millipedes discharge the defensive agents upon disturbance. The 
alkaloids are the most structurally intriguing and least studied of all of the millipede defensive secretions, and found 
in one millipede subterclass, the Colobognatha (fungusfeeding millipedes). This subterclass is composed of four 
orders (Platydesmida, Polyzoniida, Siphonocryptida and Siphonophorida) and they are known to produce simple 
monoterpenes (pinenes and limonene), along with various heterocyclic terpenoid alkaloids e.g. deoxybuzonamine 
(1), polyzonimines (2), and gosodesmine (3) (Smolanoff et al. 1975; Shear 2015; Hassler et al. 2020; Jones et al. 2022).

Description:
Disparate compounds found in the chemical secretions of millipedes from the order Platydesmida.

Text:
Members of the millipede order Platydesmida have intriguing qualities such as egg brooding, and other 
quasisocial traits, and are almost exclusively associated with various fungal taxa, which some consume in unusual 
circular social aggregations called pinwheels (Macias et al. 2019; Wong et al. 2020). All of the species of the 
Platydesmida with characterized chemical secretions, and its evolutionary sister Polyzoniida (Rodriguez et al. 2018), 
have disparate heterocyclic terpenoid alkaloids, including Brachycybe lecontii from the eastern U.S. that produces 1 
and Gosodesmus claremontus from California and Oregon that produces 3 (Hassler et al. 2020; Jones et al. 2022) (Fig. 1).
