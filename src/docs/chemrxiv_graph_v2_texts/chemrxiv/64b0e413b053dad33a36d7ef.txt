Description:
A tetrahedral semiconductor that can be integrated with wurtzite-type ferroelectrics.

Text:
These two key features make ferroelectrics
promising materials for energyefficient data storage in compar
ison to dynamic random access memory6 and for neuromor
phic computing and related memorylogic hybrids, which need
simultaneous and colocated data storage and information pro
cessing.79 Recently discovered tetrahedral (wurtzitetype) fer
roelectrics are of particular interest because of the relative ease
of direct and highquality integration with existing and emerging
tetrahedral semiconductors (e.g., Si, GaAs, GaN, SiC, AlN).6,10
