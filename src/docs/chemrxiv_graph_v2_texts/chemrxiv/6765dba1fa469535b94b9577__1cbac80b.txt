Description:
Used as a reference for standard reduction potentials.

Due to a larger atomic
weight of Na, the theoretical capacity of a Na anode is smaller (1,165 mAh g1) than that of a Li
anode (3,829 mAh g1) 3. The standard reduction potential of Na (2.7 V vs. SHE) is higher
(easier to reduce) than that of Li (3.07 V vs. SHE), which implies a slightly narrower (300 mV)
working voltage window, and thus an inferior energy density 3. Moreover, the larger size of the
Naions (1.06 A cation radius) as compared to Li (0.76 A cation radius) requires suitable crystal
structures that are able to intercalate the larger Naions in a reversible manner 2, 3.
