Description:
Used in the amplified detection of nucleic acids.

To address 
this issue a number of methods were developed, notably using aggregation induced emission (AIE), which 
yielded ultrabright fluorescent nanomaterials.3738 However, this method is more suitable for preparation of 
nanostructures where the core of dye aggregates is coated with a polymer shell,34 rather than dispersion of 
the dye in the polymer matrix.39 The use of bulky side groups could also improve the brightness of polymeric 
materials, although this approach requires dedicated multistep synthesis of rather complex dyes.40 
Previously, we proposed to use bulky counterions to prevent ACQ in polymer matrixes.41 This method 
enabled high dye loadings inside polymeric NPs, yielding NPs of exceptional brightness42 and lightharvesting 
properties.43 They were successfully applied for amplified detection of nucleic acids4445 and oxygen46 as well
