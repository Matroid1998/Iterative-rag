Description:
A molecule that can be converted to liquid fuel through electrocatalytic hydrogenation.

Text:
Electrocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction can be a promising approach for renewable energy 
production through conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel and such hydrogenation reactions are also 
very important for fundamental chemistry such as CC coupling and CH bond formation 
reactions.13 Among various metals in heterogenous electrocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation reaction, 
Cu has been found as an effective electrocatalyst for CO2 hydrogenation reaction.4 In the case of 
other electrodes, Ti, Fe, Ni, or Ptbased electrodes are found to be promising for hydrogen 
productions5 whereas Ag, Au or Zn based electrodes are efficient for CO productions6,7 and Pb, 
Pd, Au, Cd, In, Sn, or Rubased electrodes favor formate810 productions.

Description:
Involved in hydrogenation reactions with challenges of high overpotential and low product selectivity.

Text:
Hori and coworkers 
have shown that CH4 and C2H4 are the two major products on Cu based catalysts with high current 
density and Faradic efficiency (FE).4,10,11 However, the required potential for CO2 hydrogenation 
is relatively high (1.0 V) and therefore, the efficiency of Cu based catalysts is less for such 
reaction.12 Further to this, the selectivity of the product is less as various products can be achieved 
at comparable potential. Hence, the major difficulties in the electrochemical CO2 hydrogenation 
reaction are high overpotential and low product selectivity which hamper the development and 
application of CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Several research groups have reported that the 
selectivity and activity of CO2 hydrogenation reaction are highly influenced by the morphology of 
the Cu surface.
