Description:
A product of higher hydrocarbon conversion that can be used in synthesis processes.

Text:
Materials engineering and catalysis are known as central sciences, which can deeply contribute to the
technological development of our nations, and as well as ensure the environmental protection and cleaning from
both organic and inorganic contaminants. So, the design and synthesis of powerfully performance materials are
required for many technologies, such as in conversion of higher hydrocarbons to lower hydrocarbon as methane
(CH4) or to carbon monoxide (COCO2), methanol (CH3OH) or even to hydrogen (H2) 1,2. Also, performance
hybrid materials are also so wanted for recycling waste products such harmless (CO2), and harmful (CONOx) to
valueadded products, because it should be considered as an alternative fuels, which limit the use of feedstock
fuels from natural gas reforming or higher hydrocarbons cracking 3,4.

Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Furthermore, in 2019, a review discussed on the use of rare earth elements
with transition metalbased materials for ecatalysts design, synthesis, and applications were exhaustively
analyzed in Gaos research work 22. It shows that these rare earth metals could be used for materials
engineering for hightech applications as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), methanol oxidation reaction
(MOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Many benefits and challenges
of hybrid materials made via the use of rare earth elements are considered in the study. An alumina (Al2O3)
supported nickel catalysts (NiAl2O3) modified by rare earth elements was demonstrated as a highly active
catalyst for the decomposition of NH3 as described in Okuras paper 23.
