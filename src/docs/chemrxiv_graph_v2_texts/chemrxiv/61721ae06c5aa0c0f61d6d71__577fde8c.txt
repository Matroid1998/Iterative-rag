Description:
Promotes the addition of secondamides or carbamates to the triple bond of siloxyalkyne at room temperature.

Text:
They found that 
AgNTf2 can promotes the addition of secondamides or 
carbamates to the triplebond of siloxyalkyne successfully 
in the room temperature within 30 min (Scheme 1a). In this 
reaction, the Econfigured Markovnikov product is 
exclusively obtained. The authors also found that the 
commonly used ynamides and simple internal alkynes are 
inactive in the same condition. Based on deuterium label 
experiment, the author proposed a silver induced 
nucleophilic 
addition 
mechanism 
(NUA 
mechanism, 
Scheme 1b). In this mechanism, the silver(I) coordinated 
with siloxyalkyne 1 to form complex INTA, the amide 2 
then nucleophilic attack the siloxyalkyne 1 to form ZINTB. Proton transfer of ZINTB lead to final product Z3. The 
nucleophilic attack step is thought to be rate determine step 
(RDS).
