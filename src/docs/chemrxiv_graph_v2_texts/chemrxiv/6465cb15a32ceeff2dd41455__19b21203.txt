Description:
Forms complexes with multifunctional carbene ligands for reversible chemisorption of carbon monoxide.

Text:
In this context, we have reported the 
reversible, recyclable, and pressureresponsive roomtemperaturechemisorption of carbon 
monoxide (CO) on a zerovalent nickel complexes that bear multifunctional multipurpose carbene 
ligands,14 namely Nphosphine oxidesubstituted imidazolinylidenes (SPoxIms) and the 
corresponding imidazolylidenes (PoxIms) (Figure 1B, left).15,16 (S)PoxIm ligands in tetrahedral 
(S)PoxImNi(CO)n complexes selectively adopt either a C (n  3) or C,O (n  2) coordination 
mode, which can be interconverted through the additionexclusion of CO. 
A strategy based on the use of Lewis acids (LAs) is another potential option for reversibly 
modulating the electronicspatial environment around metal centers that bear multifunctional 
ligands (Figure 1A, right). The LAmediated process can cause a substantial change in both the 
electronic state and spatial environment of the metal center due to the change in the number of 
ligands.

Description:
The spatial environment around its center can be reversibly transformed using (S)PoxIms as multifunctional ligands.

have reported an example 
that relies predominantly on an electrostatic interactions17,18 involving the reversible 
complexation of Na and a crownether moiety included in a Rh complex that bears Aza
CrownPhos; the reactivity of the Rh complex can be regulated through the Namediated 
interconversion.19 The authors evaluated the change in the spatial environment around the Rh 
center using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry, even though a 
quantitative evaluation of how much the field expandeddiminished via the reaction was not 
discussed. Herein, we present a novel strategy to reversibly transform the spatial environment 
around a nickel center by combining (S)PoxIms 1ad (Figure 1C) as multifunctional ligands and
