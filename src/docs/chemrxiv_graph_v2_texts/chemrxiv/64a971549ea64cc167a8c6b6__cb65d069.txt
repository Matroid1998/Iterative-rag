Description:
Fluorination does not significantly alter its conformation.

Text:
The nearest equivalent for carbohydrates is the controlled replacement of 
individual OHgroups with hydrogen or fluorine to reveal which OHgroups are important for binding.10, 11 
Whereas simple deoxygenation is almost always detrimental to binding, deoxyfluorination (OH to F) can 
potentially provide a more diverse range of effects (Figure 1b)12 as fluorine is a hydrogenbond acceptor 
surrogate.13, 14 Furthermore, fluorination enhances CHp interactions involving adjacent CH bonds,1517 
modifies lipophilicity,1820 and can facilitate attractive multipolar interactions.2123 OH to F replacement has 
a minimal steric effect and does not significantly alter monosaccharide conformation, reinforced by 
emerging glycan 3D structures.24, 25 Fluorination can also lead to unfavourable interaction effects, such as 
loss of hydrogen bonding, or mismatched dipoles or partial charges.
