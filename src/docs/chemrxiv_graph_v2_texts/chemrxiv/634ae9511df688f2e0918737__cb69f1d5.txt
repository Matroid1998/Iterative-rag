Description:
A precursor gas used in plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition to produce hydrogenated amorphous carbon nitride films.

Text:
The material carbon nitride has been a research attraction for quite a long time. Different methodologies 
have been used to deposit carbon nitride films with different bonding configurations. The plasma 
enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) using N2C2H2 precursor gases produce hydrogenated 
amorphous carbon nitride (aCHN) films which we have deposited on Si(100) substrates at 400oC 
substrate temperature for 2 hrs with RF power of 600 W 1. SiCN in the form of nanocomposite thin 
films were deposited on Si(100), glass as well as steel substrates at different conditions by the process of 
magnetron sputtering using a SiC target.
