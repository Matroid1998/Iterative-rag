Description:
Molecular nitrogen present in VLEO environments, contributing to atmospheric drag on spacecraft.

Text:
VLEO environments contain predominantly 
atomic oxygen (AO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), which collide with ram surfaces on spacecraft at relative 
velocities of 7.5 km s1.511 Structural, thermalcontrol, and coating materials containing organic polymers 
are particularly susceptible to AO attack at these high velocities, resulting in erosion, roughening, and 
degradation of function.1227 Furthermore, the high densities of the atmosphere at VLEO altitudes, on the 
order of 109 cm3,57 cause sufficient drag to require a propulsion system for a satellite to maintain orbit, 
leading to increased mass and complexity. To maximize the survivability of a VLEO satellite while 
minimizing cost, the satellite must be designed to have low drag and high AO resistance.
