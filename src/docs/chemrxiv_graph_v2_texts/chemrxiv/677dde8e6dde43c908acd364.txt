Description:
Substrates that can undergo monoselective or regioselective functionalization under Mukaiyama-type conditions.

Text:
One caveat to this approach is the usage of ozone, as this electrophilic oxidant is known to react 
widely with a variety of functional groups. Generally, controlling the stoichiometry of O 
for reaction with specific functional groups on substrates is challenging due to its gaseous nature. In contrast, under Mukaiyamatype conditions, optimizing reagent loading and catalyst structure 
allows for monoselective or regioselective functionalization of substrates bearing multiple olefins 
even in the presence of excess O22. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025xwbdj ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000187417236 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
