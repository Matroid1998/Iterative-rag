Description:
A cubic Laves phase forming a pyrochlore network.

Bi is known to form several stable hypervalent polyan
ions, such as Bi square network found in LiBi and NaBi but not 
observed in the isoelectronic NaSb14. Similarly, CaBi2 and the 
recently reported SrBi2 both host a hypervalent Bi square lattice 
5,6, which is missing in the isoelectronic CaSb2 7. A number of binary bismuth superconductors are known, in
cluding Ca11Bi10x 8, CaBi2 9,10, SrBi3 11,12, BaBi3 13, Ba2Bi3 14, 
LiBi 4,15, NaBi 3, KBi2 1618, RbBi2 18, and CsBi2 19. The latter 
three compounds are cubic Laves phases, crystallizing in a re
latively simple MgCu2type structure in which Bi atoms form a 
pyrochlore (vertex sharing tetrahedral) network (Fig. 1).

Description:
A compound where superconductivity emerges from the Bi42 pyrochlore lattice.

Inter
estingly, while the MgCu2 is the 5th most common binary inter
metallic structure type 20, only a few of the known compounds 
feature a pblock element occupying the pyrochlore network  
besides the three dibismuthides, these are MgIn2 21, SnS2 22, and 
RAl2, (R  Sr, Ba, rareearth metals, Th, U). Here we present the results of our experimental and computa
tional studies on RbBi2 and CsBi2, concentrated on the effects 
of strong SOC on superconducting properties. We show that in 
both compounds superconductivity emerges from the Bi42 py
rochlore lattice and that the relativistic effects play a complex 
role in stability and properties of the two phases.
