Description:
A major product on Cu based catalysts with high current density and Faradic efficiency.

Text:
Hori and coworkers 
have shown that CH4 and C2H4 are the two major products on Cu based catalysts with high current 
density and Faradic efficiency (FE).4,10,11 However, the required potential for CO2 hydrogenation 
is relatively high (1.0 V) and therefore, the efficiency of Cu based catalysts is less for such 
reaction.12 Further to this, the selectivity of the product is less as various products can be achieved 
at comparable potential. Hence, the major difficulties in the electrochemical CO2 hydrogenation 
reaction are high overpotential and low product selectivity which hamper the development and 
application of CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Several research groups have reported that the 
selectivity and activity of CO2 hydrogenation reaction are highly influenced by the morphology of 
the Cu surface.

Description:
The major product on Cu(100) surface.

Text:
Hori and coworkers have demonstrated that CH4 is the main product on Cu(111) 
surface whereas C2H4 is the major product on Cu(100) surface.1315 In this context, Koper and co
workers have shown two different pathways on the periodic Cu(100) surface for the formation of 
C2 based product.1618 Both the pathways have some common intermediates which can form CH4 
at 0.8 to 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In this case, the most important step for 
C2 based product formation is the dimerization of CO at 0.4 V vs RHE. After these reports,
