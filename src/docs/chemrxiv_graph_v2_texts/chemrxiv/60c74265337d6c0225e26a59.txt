Description:
Bonds whose formation and cleavage are essential reactions carried out by enzymes.

Text:
The formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds is 
one of the most essential reactions carried out by en
zymes. The general mechanistic features of phos
phodiester cleavage are universally conserved in ribo
zymes, polymerases, nucleases, and a wide variety of 
other nucleic acid processing enzymes such as inte
grases, transposases or topoisomerases (See ref1 and 
references therein). The phosphodiester cleavage gen
erally follows an associative mechanism and utilizes the 
wellestablished two metal ion mechanism.2 Two diva
lent ions are typically bound by one bridging aspartate 
coordinating both metal ions, another aspartate and a 
glutamate (referred to as a DDE motif). Enzymes of the nuclease family are found in all branch
es of life.
