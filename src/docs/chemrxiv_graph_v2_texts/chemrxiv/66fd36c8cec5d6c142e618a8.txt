Description:
Interacts with ATP to form Dluciferyl adenylate in the bioluminescence reaction.

Bioluminescence is the ability of living organisms to emit light, a property widely used in 
biotechnology and biomedicine 1. Firefly is not only the most efficient bioluminescent system 
known today 2, but also the most intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically 3. Despite this, there is still a lack of understanding of the exact mechanism behind the firefly 
bioluminescence. The bioluminescence reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme called luciferase (FLuc). The 
generally accepted mechanism for this enzymatic reaction involves the following stages (Fig. 1) 
1) interaction of Dluciferin with ATP to form Dluciferyl adenylate and its subsequent 
deprotonation; 2) oxidation of the resulting intermediate by oxygen leading to dioxetanone; 3) 
dioxetanone decomposition, leading to excited oxyluciferin, the lightemitting molecule in firefly 
bioluminescence.
