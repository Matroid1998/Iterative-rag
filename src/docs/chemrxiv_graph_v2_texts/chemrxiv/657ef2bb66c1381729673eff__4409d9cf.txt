The multifaceted reactivity of alkyl chlorides makes them important 
building blocks for the assembly of architecturally complex C(sp3)
rich molecules (Figure 1A)1. Despite their wellrecognized utilities, 
methods to access alkyl chlorides directly from readily available rea
gents remain rare2, beyond classical syntheses from Markovnikov ad
ditions to alkenes3 and substitution reactions of alcohols4. One area 
that has resulted in the evolution of new technologies for the synthe
sis of complex alkyl chlorides has been transformations based on the 
difunctionalization of alkenes. In the 1950s, Meerwein and cowork
ers developed a radicalbased approach to alkyl chloride synthesis 
through the arylchlorination of alkenes (Figure 1B)5a, b.

Description:
Compounds whose synthesis could benefit from a mechanistically distinct modular and catalytic method.

Text:
1,2Arylpalladation to the carboncarbon double bond of 
the alkene generates an alkylPd(II) intermediate, the interception 
of which with a highly electrophilic chlorination reagent leads to the 
formation of a putative alkylPd(IV)Cl species and prompts CCl 
bond formation through reductive elimination. Although these 
highvalent Pdmediated transformations have underpinned the 
syntheses of many arylethyl chlorides, the use aryl tin reagents di
minishes the attractiveness of these methods (Figure 1B)12. We reasoned that the invention of a mechanistically distinct modu
lar and catalytic method for the synthesis of alkyl chlorides would be 
a valuable addition to the arsenal of synthetic tools and of interest to 
practitioners of moleculemaking in academic and industrial envi
ronments.
