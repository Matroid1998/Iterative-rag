Description:
An element that combines with metals to form oxides, contributing to their properties.

The origin of this problem is that the adsorp
tion energies of the catalytic intermediates in this fourstep
reaction are related by the scaling relations, prohibiting the
independent tuning necessary to make the reaction run at
the thermodynamic potential.2,3 For applications in proton
exchange membrane fuel cells, IrO2 and RuO2 are currently
some of the best candidates for the anode catalyst mate
rial, exhibiting reasonably high activity and stability.47
However, due to the cost and scarcity of Ir and Ru, eorts
to increase the activity relative to the amount of precious
metal employed are continuing alongside eorts to replace
these materials with cheaper and more abundant alterna
tives.811
Highentropy oxides (HEOs) are oxides consisting of ve
or more metals in addition to oxygen.12 Since the rst char
acterisation of a HEO in 2015,13 these materials have been
investigated for their distinct thermal, magnetic and electro
chemical properties,1417 and furthermore inspired the de
velopment of other multicomponent ceramic materials.18
Thermodynamically, HEOs are analogous to highentropy
alloys (HEAs) in that the congurational entropy, arising
from the many possible arrangements of the dierent ele
ments, plays an important role in the thermodynamic sta
bility of the materials.19 The large combinatorial space of
a multinary phase diagram also suggests that properties of
interest can be precisely tuned.

Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction.

Within catalysis, this has
been demonstrated for HEAs, where the large number of
dierent atomic environments results in a distribution of
binding energies of the catalytic intermediates, with some
sites thereby reaching the maximum activity according to
the Sabatier principle.20 The catalytic properties of HEOs
are less studied,21 and the transferability of this principle
is therefore yet to be explored. Here we outline a strategy for the theoretical investiga
tion of HEOs as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Inspired by the high catalytic activity of IrO2 and RuO2,
the (110) surface of a rutile oxide based on Ir, Ru, Ti, Os
and Rh is chosen as example.
