Description:
A subunit present in chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

Text:
While known repurposed 
drug Remdesivir (RDV) (Figure 1, A) showed activity in vitro 
against SARSCoV22 and was first approved by the FDA for the 
use against SARSCoV2, there were insufficient clinical studies 
and since recently, due to low efficiency, its use for the treatment 
of COVID19 is no longer recommended.3 Also chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine (Figure 1, A)  two antimalarial drugs that are 
active against several viruses,4 including HIV, hepatitis C and 
Ebola  were reported to be active against SARSCoV2.2, 5 
These two drugs  both containing a quinoline subunit, showed 
high potency against SARSCoV2  but neither in vitro studies 
nor clinical trials gave results consistent enough either in single 
use or in combination with other drugs like lopinavir or ritonavir.2, 
5b, 6 
Recent studies demonstrated, that cyclic synthetic 
peroxides exhibit antiparasitic,7 anticancer 8, antifungal,7e, 9 
antitubercular10 and antiviral11 activities.
