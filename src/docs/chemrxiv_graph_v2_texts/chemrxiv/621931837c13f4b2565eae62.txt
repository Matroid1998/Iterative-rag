Description:
Electron-poor alkenes are activated by a nucleophilic catalyst in the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction.

Text:
MoritaBaylisHillman (MBH) reaction is one of the most prominent carboncarbon bondforming processes in synthetic or
ganic chemistry with enormous synthetic utility, promise, and potential.1 The reaction constitutes a very handy means for 
converting simple starting materials into densely functionalized products under mild, metalfree reaction conditions. The func
tional grouprich MBH adducts can serve as useful synthons for various transformations further increasing the molecular com
plexity.2 

Scheme 1. MoritaBaylisHillman reaction and concept to expand 
its scope by using Nactivated pyridines as electrophiles. In the classic MBH reaction, electronpoor alkenes are activated by a nucleophilic catalyst and coupled with aldehydes 
or, in the case of azaMBH version, imines (Scheme 1a).
