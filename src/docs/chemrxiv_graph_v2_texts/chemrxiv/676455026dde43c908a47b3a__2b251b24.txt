Recently, materials based on metal hydroxides have been
considered for the OER. Several studies have highlighted
the efficiency of nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) as an ac
tive anode catalyst for water and biomass electrolyzers
under alkaline conditions, especially for catalyzing the
OER reaction. 2, 511 Coelectrocatalysis, which re
places the OER with the oxidation of organic molecules,
has been investigated as a means to enhance hydrogen
production efficiency. For example, reactions involving
organic molecules such as biomassderived alcohols, 5
hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and natural plant deriva
tives have shown promise, leading to greater energy effi
ciency in hydrogen production.
