Description:
Found in high concentrations in marine environments and contributes to new particle formation.

Text:
Iodinecontaining compounds can be found in large concentrations, especially in marine
coastal environments but also in the Arctic and the Antarctic,1115 due to large emissions
from the ocean surface.16,17 High concentrations of iodinecontaining compounds has been
shown to correlate with high particle concentrations12 and has been shown to lead to new par
ticle formation in the Arctic and marine environments.12,14,18,19 The contribution of iodine
containing compounds to NPF has previously been studied with computational methods,
but the exact contribution to NPF remains poorly understood.4 These studies have focused
