Description:
A transition metal disulfide dichalcogenide used in two-dimensional single atom catalysts for metal-air batteries.

In this scenario, developing the costeffective or even bifunctional 
52 
electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER with industrially relevant activity is highly 
53 
desired for metalair batteries at the current stage. 54 
Recently, twodimensional transition metal (TM) single atom catalysts (SACs) 
55 
for metalair batteries have received tremendous attention attributed to the low cost, 
56 
high specific surface area, unique chemical and physical characteristics 13, such as 
57 
transitionmetal disulfide dichalcogenides 14, twodimensional (2D) metalorganic 
58 
frameworks 15, etc. And intensive efforts have been made to exploreimprove their 
59 
ORR or OER activity and inspiring achievements have been made in recent years 
60 
16,17. For instance, Li and colleagues 14 demonstrated the Cudoped MoS2
