Description:
A commonly used technical ceramic in industrial applications.

Text:
Ceramics are usually brittle materials, i.e. with very little deformation before fracture. Although ceramics are 
often used for their chemical inertia, high rigidity, and functional properties at high temperature, their use is 
largely limited due to their brittle behaviour, especially for structural applications 1. Alumina is one of the most 
commonly used technical ceramic in industrial applications. It can be reinforced with zirconia resulting in 
composites commonly called ZirconiaToughened Alumina (ZTA) which are characterized by higher mechanical 
properties than conventional alumina 23. The use of a stabilizer, such as yttria, retains zirconia in the 
tetragonal phase after sintering at room temperature.
