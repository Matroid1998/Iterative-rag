Description:
Exhibit a retarding effect on the initial dissolution rate of cement clinker phases.

Text:
Adsorption studies revealed
22
that the fruit acids predominantly affect the C3A dissolution, which is the main reacting clinker phase in
23
the first minutes after water addition 8, 18, 11. However, this was observed in systems where dissolution
24
was not completely separated from nucleation of hydrate phases. This means that the retarding effect
25
of citric and tartaric acid on the initial dissolution rate of cement clinker phases can also be influenced
26
by nucleation events. 27
Rottstege et al. used 29Si solidstate NMR of fresh cement paste to investigate the influence of citric
28
and tartaric acid.
