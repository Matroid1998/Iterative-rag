Description:
Used in DRAM technology with phosphorus doping for n-type conductivity.

DRAM device scaling has gotten aggressive with each 
progressing node 1,2. This aggressive scaling of DRAM 
array results in significant bottleneck for DRAM device 
fabrication. Over the years, this has resulted in disruptive 
memory technologies to take shape 39. In the current 
DRAM technology, there are several places where we are 
required to use ntype Polysilicon, using Phosphorus doping 
1012. For example The contact regions between the 
middleoftheline (MOL) and the frontendofline 
(FEOL) require the use of Polycrystalline SiP to design 
optimal contacts. But DRAM scaling has rendered 
Polysilicon deposition difficult due to its nonselective 
nature. There is a natural tendency to deviate into a 
monocrystalline selective deposition to enable such 
aggressive scaling. Selective epitaxy is one of the most 
obvious candidates for monocrystalline SiP deposition 13
