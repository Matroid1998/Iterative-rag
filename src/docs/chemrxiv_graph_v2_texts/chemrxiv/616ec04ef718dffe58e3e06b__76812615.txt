A physiological coagonist of the Nmethyl Daspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor.

Text:
Dserine is a physiological coagonist of the Nmethyl Daspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor, a key 
excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain. DSerine in the brain is synthesized from its Lisomer by serine 
racemase and is metabolized by the Damino acid oxidase (DAO, DAAO), a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the 
oxidative degradation of Damino acids including Dserine to the corresponding keto acids. The function of the 
NMDA receptor requires the presence of both the agonist (glutamate) and the coagonist (Dserine, glycine, andor 
Dalanine).

Description:
The predominant NMDA coagonist in the forebrain linked to schizophrenia.

Text:
Importantly, Dserine has been reported to be the predominant NMDA coagonist in the forebrain and 
linked directly to schizophrenia.1 Dserine concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to be 
decreased in schizophrenia patients,2 and oral administration of Dserine improved symptoms of schizophrenia when 
used as an adjuvant to typical and atypical antipsychotics.3 Thus, it is plausible to explore pharmaceutical inhibition 
of DAO function as putative novel therapeutics to treat the positive (psychotic), negative and cognitive symptoms in 
schizophrenia. The simplest DAO inhibitor benzoic acid (1) was reported in 1956.4 Since the early 2000s, many small molecule 
DAO inhibitors have been reported in the literature (Figure 1).5 They all mimic the substrate Dserine and bind to 
the catalytic site of DAO.
