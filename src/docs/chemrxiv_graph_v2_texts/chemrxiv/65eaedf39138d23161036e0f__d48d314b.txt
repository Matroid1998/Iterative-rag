3. Remarkably, ChClLA exhibits outstanding lignin
extraction yields from biomass 4, 5, 6, yet the molec
ular mechanisms driving this extraction remain a sub
ject of ongoing investigation 7, 8, 9. Intriguingly, the
performance of ChClLA is highly contingent on the
ChClLA ratio, with a higher proportion of LA lead
ing to enhanced eciency. Notably, a high molar ratio
of ChClLA, particularly at 110, has been found to am
