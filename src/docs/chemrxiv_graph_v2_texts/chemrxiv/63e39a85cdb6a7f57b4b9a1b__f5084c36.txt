Description:
Used as a base in the acetylation process.

of arabinosylated 
FmocHyp 1416 to the dipeptide was monitored by ninhy
drinchloranil tests and highresolution mass spectrometry 
(HRMS) after cleavage of small aliquots of resins. As we used 
a slight excess of resinbound amine groups with respect to the 
arabinosylated building blocks, remaining aminegroups were 
permanently acetylated used Ac2O and pyridine. After this, 
FmocValOH coupling was conducted manually in order to 
monitor coupling this betasubstituted amino acid to the differ
ent sterically hindered glycosylated tripeptides. Once formation 
of tetrapeptides 1719 was confirmed, subsequent chain elon
gation was conducted using an automated peptide synthesizer. After acidolytic cleavage from the resin, the crude (glyco)pep
tides were purified using reversedphase preparativeHPLC, 
yielding analytically pure Np and Acprotected (glyco)pep
tides 2023 (see ESI).
