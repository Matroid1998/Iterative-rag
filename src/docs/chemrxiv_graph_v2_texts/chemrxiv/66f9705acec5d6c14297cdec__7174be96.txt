Description:
A derivative of PEG known for biocompatibility, tunable mechanics, and rapid reaction kinetics.

Text:
PEG is a synthetic 
material with profound tunability in chain lengths, functionalization, and architecture. PEGDA is well 
characterized with known biocompatibility1921, tunable mechanics22, 23, and rapid reaction kinetics, which 
allow for it to be utilized across several tissues and applications19, 2325. PEGDA is also one of the most used 
derivatives of PEG due to its ready photopolymerization andor MichaelType additions through the 
terminal acrylate functional groups. When polymerized in water, it becomes a covalent, permanent
