2Thio1,3,2dithiaphospholane, 1, and 2thio1,3,2oxathiaphospholane, 2, ring systems 
are useful as synthetic synthons for the formation of nucleoside 5OPthio or dithio
phosphate analogs or oligonucleotides bearing phosphorothioate or dithioate linkages.1 
Nucleoside 5OP(thio)triphosphate analogs,2 have gained wide application in 
biochemistry and cell biology.3 These compounds have been used also for the enzymatic 
synthesis of DNA and RNA fragments possessing chiral phosphorothioate internucleotide 
bonds. The related phosphorodithioate analogs have been used as lubricants and fuel 
additives.4 
During 
the 
last 
decade, 
oligodeoxynucleotide 
analogs 
containing 
phophorodithioate linkages (dithioate DNA) have received increasing attention for 
biochemical and therapeutic applications as well.4 This is because dithioate DNARNA is 
achiral, isoelectronic with respect to normal DNA, and nuclease resistant. Several methods 
for the synthesis of these analogs have been developed.5 Recently we have reported the
