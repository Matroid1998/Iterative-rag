Description:
Considered as a potential catalyst for industrial photocatalysis.

Iron oxides, among the many other earthabundant mineral oxides, have been closely involved in 
the origin and evolution of life on Earth.1 Naturally, they occur as polymorphic mineral oxides and 
can show a rich structural anisotropy.2 This inherently enables them to demonstrate a wide range 
of physical and chemical properties. Also, their interaction with broadspectrum sunlight is of 
significance to various geochemical and industrial processes. Recently, the hematite (FeO) and 
magnetite (FeO) are being considered again as a potential catalyst for industrial photocatalysis.
