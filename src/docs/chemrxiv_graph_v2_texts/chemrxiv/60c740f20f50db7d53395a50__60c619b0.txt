In this context, the generation of palladium carbene 
intermediates combined with crosscoupling with 
organic halides has been highly successful for olefin 
synthesis in the past, but often results in the formation 
of alkene products through hydride elimination, with 
few notable exceptions.2b,3 An interesting approach first 
reported by Van Vranken and coworkers, employing 
vinylhalides as coupling partners allows to conserve an 
allylic stereocenter and to introduce at the same time a 
heteroatom nucleophile (Figure 1B).7 Nevertheless, the 
reaction proceeds via a allyl palladium species, 
resulting into a 1,3 relationship between nucleophile 
and vinyl group. In comparison to palladium as catalyst, 
rhodium usually allows to avoid hydride elimination.
