Description:
Used in CMOS interconnect structures as a conducting metal, benefiting from atomically thin diffusion barriers to maximize interconnect volume.

Text:
For example, metals
which wet a surface and can be deposited in a flat,
nonisland morphology, are needed as conducting metals
for interconnects in semiconductor devices 42. This
is particularly relevant as TMDs have shown promise
as diffusion barriers for Cu in CMOS interconnect
structures, allowing for atomically thin barriers which
can maximise the volume of the interconnect metal in
vias. This is important for next generation technology
nodes such as GateAllAround and Complementary
Field Effect Transistors, as it would keep line resistance
low while allowing downscaling of CMOS structures
