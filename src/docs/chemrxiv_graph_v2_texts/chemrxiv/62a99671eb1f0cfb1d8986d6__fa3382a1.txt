Description:
A transition metal whose double layer structure in single crystals is of interest in electrocatalysis.

Text:
There is a wave of renewed interest in the double layer structure in electrocatalysis,14 probably due to 
two reasons. First, a multitude of electrolyte effects, such as the cation effect59 and the pH effect1013, 
emerge recently in electrocatalysis, and there is growing consensus that demystifying these electrolyte 
effects requires fundamental knowledge of the double layer structure.3, 14 Several review articles on 
electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have been published recently.1417 Second, a growing body of 
experimental data related to the double layer structure of single crystals of transition metals, notably 
platinum, have been reported recently.4, 1823 These new data, though not fully consistent with each 
other as detailed below, have already surprised us as they do not agree, even qualitatively, with classical 
double layer models.
