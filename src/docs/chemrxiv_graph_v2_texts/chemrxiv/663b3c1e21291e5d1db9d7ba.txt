Description:
A solution that can increase ionic strength, inducing interparticle aggregation and wall deposition.

Text:
Up to five particles participate in a bridge, in both con
stricted granular and suspension flows1921. Clogging can also be
induced by attractive interactions between the particles and the
pore walls22,23. Clogging by deposition can be induced or pre
vented by surface treatments of the channels walls . Increasing
the ionic strength of the suspension, for instance particle disper
sion in NaCl solution, can induce interparticle aggregation and
wall deposition18. Colloidal interactions, hydrodynamic and contact forces play
competitive roles in the formation, stability and growth of
clogs2427. This competition leads to critical phenomena in clog
ging processes. In a crossflow setup, adjusting viscosity and
flowrate can prevent clogging by deposition at the intersection25.
