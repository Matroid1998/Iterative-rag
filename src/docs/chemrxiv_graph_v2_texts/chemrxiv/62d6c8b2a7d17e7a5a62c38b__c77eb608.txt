Description:
A linker used in MOFs with methoxy functionalization.

Text:
Using two methoxyfunctionalized
diisophthalate linkers, differing in the orientation of the
central part of the linker and consequently, the position of the
methoxy groups, they characterise two isoreticular MOFs
ZJNU58 and ZJNU59, which show different gas uptake
and selectivity performance. The orientation of the linker
in ZJNU59 creates a narrower pore size which increases
the van der Waals potential overlap thus strengthening the
interaction between gas molecules and the framework. One of the most frequent modifications to tune the chem
istry of MOFs is linker functionalization  e.g. UiO66,19
NH2UiO66,20 ClUiO66,21 yet there are very limited
