Description:
A crucial intermediate in CEC reactions, acting as the catalyst resting state and capturing free alkyl radicals.

Text:
Specifically, in CEC reactions between aryl and alkyl halides, complexes of 
the type LNiII(Ar)X (X  Cl, Br, or I) are proposed to be crucial intermediates, as they are both the 
catalyst resting state and responsible for capturing free alkyl radicals (Figure 1b).7a In an ideal 
CEC reaction, the LNiII(Ar)X intermediate would be stable and the rate at which radicals are 
generated would be controlled relative to the concentration of LNiII(Ar)X to facilitate effective 
radical capture (Figure 2). However, the rate of alkyl radical generation by a NiI halide 
intermediate cannot be tuned separately from the concentration of LNiII(Ar)X because both 
complexes are intermediates on the same catalytic cycle.
