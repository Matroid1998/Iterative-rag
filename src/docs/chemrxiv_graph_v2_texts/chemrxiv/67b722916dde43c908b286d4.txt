Description:
Involved in metal-free strain-promoted alkyneazide cycloaddition (SPAAC), an efficient and safe alternative to Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyneazide cycloaddition.

It offers several advantages over other bioconjugation techniques
due to its high orthogonality, biocompatibility, high yields, and rapid kinetics.10,11 Metal
free strainpromoted alkyneazide cycloaddition (SPAAC) has been shown to be an efficient
and safe alternative to Cu(I)catalyzed alkyneazide cycloaddition (CuAAC), where the final
conjugates often contained cytotoxic copper.12 Both CuAAC and SPAAC have been already
exploited on various NPs systems such as quantum dots,1315 as well as polymeric,1618
metallic1921 and metal oxide NPs.2224
The quantification of the dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) moiety, widely used as the alkyne
in SPAAC, is rather straightforward because of the presence of an absorbance band in the
