Description:
A catalyst used in commercial alkaline water electrolyzers for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Evolution Reaction.

Text:
Nickel (alone or alloyed with iron in stainless steel) is the catalyst employed at both 
the cathode and the anode of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers 6, for the 
electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) 7,8 and Oxygen Evolution 
Reaction (OER) 9,10. Its relatively high activity and far lower cost with respect to 
rare Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) make it the electrocatalyst of choice for the 
wider diffusion of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) 11,12. AWE is already used to 
manufacture around 1 of the global annual output of hydrogen. Using electricity 
from renewable energy sources, the technology will be widely deployed to produce 
solar (or green) hydrogen for electric mobility and other end energy uses 13.

Description:
Used in catalytic species and can be coupled with other elements and compounds to increase activity.

Text:
In recent years, plentiful research efforts have 
been placed in increasing the activity of nickel, by coupling it with other elements 
and compounds 6,16. Among these structures, Graphene Oxide (GO) has 
attracted particular interest due to its conductivity, high surface area and high 
chemical and mechanical stability 17,18. In all these attempts, however, GO is 
used as support that is decorated with Nibased catalytic species. A 
complementary approach was recently adopted with the introduction of NiGraf, a 
new molecularly doped metal comprised of GO 3D entrapped in nickelbased 
jamborite (Ni(OH)2(NiOOH)) nanoparticles 19. The catalyst is reproducibly 
synthesized by a simple onepot procedure carried out in water starting from a Ni 
precursor salt, graphene oxide and sodium borohydride as reducing agent.
