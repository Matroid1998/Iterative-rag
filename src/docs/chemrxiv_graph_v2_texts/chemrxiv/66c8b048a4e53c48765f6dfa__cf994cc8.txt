Compounds involved in CN cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
On the other hand, while the CN crosscoupling of 
anilines and aryl halides may incorporate a broader substrate 
scope, this mitigative approach is still stymied by the subse
quent hydrogenation step, whose selectivity and efficiency de
pends on compatibility any appended functional group and the 
electronic properties of substrates. As an example, 4 was pre
pared with only 20 yield over 4 steps from commercially 
available starting material 3.11 The aforementioned limitations 
lead to an unmet need in medicinal chemistry for a robust and
