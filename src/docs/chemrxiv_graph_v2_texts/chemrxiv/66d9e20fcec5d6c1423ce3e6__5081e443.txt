Description:
A metal that can be substituted to alter electron concentration and effective mass in Bi2SeO2.

Although the electron concentration
in Bi2SeO2 in the aforementioned device was optimized through
a mechanical shear exfoliation method,15 other routes have also
been adopted. Substituting Bi with Sb16 and La,17 Ge,18,19 Sn,20
Ti,21 Ce,22 Nb23,24 and Ta,25 has been successful to various de
grees, either due to an increase in the electron concentration,
change in the effective mass, or a combination of both. Substi
tuting Se or O with S,26 Te,27,28 and Cl29 has increased zT com
pared to selfdoped Bi2SeO2. The highest zT of 0.69 at 773 K
was achieved by Te substitution obtained through a mechanical
shear exfoliation technique,15,28 which was claimed to increase
the concentration of donorlike Se vacancies (VSe) leading to a
sixfold enhancement in the power factor.
