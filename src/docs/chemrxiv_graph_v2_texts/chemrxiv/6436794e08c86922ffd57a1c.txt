Description:
Atoms that can be substituted into benzene to manipulate its energetic ordering.

Text:
However, if the relative energetic ordering of the B2u, B1u and E1u manifolds of benzene 
could be manipulated by extension of the molecular frame andor by suitable substitutions of carbon 
atoms, the intrinsic 1B2u3B2u inversion in benzene could give rise to an excitation spectrum in which 
the 1B2u state becomes the lowest excited state, that is, a negative ST.
