Up until recently, fullerenes were the most frequently used acceptor due to their excellent elec
tron transport and good energy alignment with commonly used donors5. They have drawbacks
when acting as acceptors, however, including weak light absorption, complex synthesis, limited
tunability, and poor photostability6,7. As an alternative, nonfullerene small molecules emerged,
showing highly tunable optical and electronic properties, strong absorption of visible and near
infrared (NIR) light, and low production cost68. The most common design for NFAs is joining
electronwithdrawing units and electron donating units, due to their pushpull effect and en
hanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). This effect has been shown to improve the PCE by
broadening the absorption spectrum and improving charge mobility9,10.
