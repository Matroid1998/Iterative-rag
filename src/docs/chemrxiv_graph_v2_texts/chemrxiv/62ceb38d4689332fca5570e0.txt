Description:
A product of mineralization degradation of materials under aerobic conditions.

Text:
The ASTM (e.g., ASTM D551118 and ASTM D552618, American Society for 
Testing and Materials) defined biodegradable materials as materials that exhibited 70 
degradation during 30 days under anaerobic conditions72,73. Under aerobic conditions, 
ASTM D640019 and ASTM D686819 require 90 mineralization degradation of the 
material into CO2 within 180 days74,75. Biodegradable polymers can be synthesized or 
extracted from different sources (Figure 1). They can be obtained from agroresource biomass 
(i.e., agropolymers). They can be extracted from microorganisms. They can be obtained from 
the conventional synthesis of bioderived monomers. Petrochemicals are important sources of
