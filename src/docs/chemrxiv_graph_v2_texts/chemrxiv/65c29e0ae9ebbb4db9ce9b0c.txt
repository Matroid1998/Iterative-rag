Description:
Macrocycles that can be used to create chiral, configurationally persistent structures.

Such bistability is unique to ssM and not possible in the 
dsM molecules.31 This dynamic behavior was previously ob
served in complex porphyrinoids, where the differences 
between (anti)aromatic conformations could be deciphered 
using NMR spectroscopy.32,33 However, a similar experi
mental achievement in topological molecular nanocarbons 
is currently missing. Inspired by the work of Durola and Herges on ssM mac
rocycles made of helicenes,3436 we have recently embedded 
a 6helicene into 7CPP (Figure 1) creating the first heli
cene paraphenylene, 6,7HPP.37 The writhe of 6helicene 
induced the necessary deformation to the molecular 
nanocarbon, which resulted in a chiral, configurationally 
persistent ssM structure with a stable nonorientable sys
tem both in the single crystal and in solution.
