Description:
The current metal of choice for device interconnects.

Text:
As the size of transistors continue to shrink in size, following Moores Law, the ability to downscale 
the lowest level device interconnects has become a bottleneck in further device miniaturisation.1,2 The 
current metal of choice for the interconnects is copper (Cu), however as the interconnect size shrinks, 
the resistivity of Cu increases, limiting its use at the smallest scales.3,4 This problem is increased as Cu 
needs a diffusion barrier to hinder it from contaminating the dielectric and a liner (or glue layer) to make
