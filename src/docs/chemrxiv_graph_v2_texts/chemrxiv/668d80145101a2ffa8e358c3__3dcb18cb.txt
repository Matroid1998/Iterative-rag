Description:
Used in the form of red phosphorus to synthesize PNa3.

Text:
This discrepancy can be assigned to the ready commercial 
availability of HN and its sblock metal salts,22,23 whilst alkali metal P reagents are typically 
synthesized from P(SiMe3)3.24,25 This parent phosphine starting material is pyrophoric and 
relatively expensive unless it is prepared directly from PNa3 (generally made in situ from red 
phosphorus and 3 eq. sodium in DME at reflux) and 3 eq. ClSiMe3; this reaction is often done on 
large scales (ca.
