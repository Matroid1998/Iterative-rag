Description:
Contains F0 centers which are neutral oxygen vacancies in the bulk crystal.

Text:
F centers can trap one or two electrons within the anion vacancy, resulting in
the formation of F and F0 centers respectively. The electrostatic stabilization effectively
retains these electrons within the vacancy due to the large Madelung constant of the ionic
crystal.4
In this study, we focus specifically on the neutral oxygen vacancy, the F0 center in the
bulk of MgO crystal, and aim to understand the optical transitions involved. The F0 center
in MgO has been extensively investigated.

Description:
Electronically complex with disagreement between molecular quantum chemical and solid-state calculations on electronic states involved in optical absorption and emission spectra.

Text:
The optical absorption energy has been computed
using quantum chemical embedded cluster approaches,5,6 periodic boundary conditions us
ing equation of motion coupled cluster theory,7 quantum Monte Carlo8 and manybody
perturbation theory methods.9,10 Despite their seemingly simple nature, MgO F0 centers are
electronically complex, and there is disagreement between the molecular quantum chemical
and solidstate calculations on the nature of the electronic states involved in the optical ab
sorption and emission spectra. The absorption maxima has been experimentally determined
to occur at 5.03 eV.11 The absorption process involving the midgap state can occur in two
ways (i) an electron is promoted to the conduction band minimum (CBM), known in liter
ature as photoionization, or (ii) defect localized excitation to one of the higher energy triply
degenerate states.
