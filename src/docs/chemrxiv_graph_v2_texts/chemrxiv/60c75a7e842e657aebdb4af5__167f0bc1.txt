Description:
Exhibit constitutional isomerism with ortho, meta, and para structures.

Text:
Nonsuperimposable structures of the same molecular 
formula can be enantiomers, diastereomers, conformers and 
constitutional isomers (structural isomers). As energies of 
enantiomers are identical, they are excluded from our 
investigation. For the other three types of isomerism, E and Z 
configurations in AA compounds and halocyclopropanes 
represent diastereomerism, gauche and anti conformers in AA 
compounds represent conformational isomerism and ortho, 
meta and para structures in halobenzenes represent 
constitutional isomerism. 2. Materials and methods
