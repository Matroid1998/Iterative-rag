Description:
Emissions from extracting and burning fossil fuels that have serious impacts on the climate and human health.

Text:
Despite
substantial progress in renewable energy technologies such as
wind and solar power, fossil fuels remain the leading energy re
source in many countries, and demand is still increasing.1 How
ever, fossil fuels are a finite resource, and the CO2 and other emis
sions from extracting and burning them have serious impacts on
the climate and on human health.2 To reduce our reliance on fos
sil fuels, it is critical both to develop a portfolio of clean energy
technologies and also to improve the efficiency with which we use
energy.37
At present, around 60 of the energy consumed globally
is wasted as heat,8,9 which has led to substantial interest in
thermoelectric generators (TEGs) to convert heat to electricity

corrections on the lattice thermal conductivity; comparison of electronicstructure
calculations with selfconsistent and nonselfconsistent HSE06 and with a variety

and thermoelectric figure of merit of the four systems examined in this work, in
cluding on the anisotropy.
