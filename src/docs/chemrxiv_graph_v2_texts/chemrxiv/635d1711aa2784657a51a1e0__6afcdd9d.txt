of additional chemical moieties. However, the bonding of hydrogels (thiolene 
radical or more classic acrylatemethacrylate radicalbased) to thiolene elastomers and alkene
functional elastomers has not been characterised in detail. In this study, we quantify the tensile 
mechanical properties of hybrid hydrogel samples formed of two elastomers bonded to a hydrogel 
material. We examine the impact of radical thiolene coupling on the crosslinking of both elastomers 
(silicone or polyesters) and hydrogels (based on thiolene crosslinking or diacrylate chemistry), and on 
the mechanics and failure behaviour of resulting hybrids. This study demonstrates the strong bonding 
of thiolene hydrogels to alkenepresenting elastomers with a range of chemistries, including silicones 
and polyesters.
