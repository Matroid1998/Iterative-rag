Description:
A conventional secondary battery technology.

Cheap, highperformance, and safe energy storage solutions are 
needed to address the increasing demand for portable electronics 
and the transition to electric mobility. Lithiumion batteries have 
replaced conventional secondary battery technology (like nickel
cadmium and nickelmetal hydride batteries) due to their high 
energy densities, high operating voltages, and stable capacity 
retention during opencircuit rest.1 Lithium metal anodes were 
quickly replaced by lithiumintercalated graphitic materials in 
order to avoid the formation of dendrites that resulted in short 
circuiting of the two electrodes.
