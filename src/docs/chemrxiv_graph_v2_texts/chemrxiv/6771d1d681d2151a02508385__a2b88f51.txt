Description:
Can be assembled with a silane into a transition state for direct radical transfer.

Text:
However, for hydrogen atom trans
fer (HAT) to take place, two molecules need to associate into 
a transition structure which results in energy penalty due to 
the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom 
that corresponds to approximately 10 kcalmol1.68 A cata
lyst that is able to assemble a silane and an olefin into a tran
sition state for direct radical transfer with an energy input 
of less than 25.5  10  35.5 kcalmol1 would thus permit a 
more energyefficient transformation. Such a transition 
state would need to be assembled in a stepwise fashion to 
limit the entropic penalty.
