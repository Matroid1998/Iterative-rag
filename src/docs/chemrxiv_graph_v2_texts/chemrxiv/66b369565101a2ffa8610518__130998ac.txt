Formed from haloalcohols and can undergo ring opening with nucleophiles such as azide and cyanide.

For this reason, protein 
engineering is often vital to adjust the enantioselectivity of a native enzyme (along with other 
enzyme characteristics) to fulfill the requirements of an industrial biocatalytic process.69 
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) have gained increasing attention in recent years for their 
application in the synthesis of a plethora of valuable products.10 Naturally, those enzymes 
catalyze the reversible dehalogenation of haloalcohols with formation of the corresponding 
epoxides.11 In the reverse reaction, a range of small C, O, N and Snucleophiles, such as 
azide, cyanide, nitrite, cyanate and thiocyanate (known as pseudohalogens), are also accepted 
for epoxide ring opening in addition to halide ions (Figure 1A).12 This enabled the preparation 
of enantioenriched nitroalcohols,13 cyanohydrins,14 oxazolidinones15 and thiiranes16 
amongst others,1720 fueled by the recent discovery of many new HHDHs from public sequence 
databases.13,2124 In most of these cases, however, protein engineering of the initially identified 
enzymes with highest activity was still necessary to achieve also high enantioselectivity.

Description:
Substrates for HHDH enzymes, with activity towards bulky forms being noted.

Thus, crystal structures for 
members of almost all currently known HHDH subtypes AG have been reported by now.13,40
44 One of them is HheG from Ilumatobacter coccineus.42 This enzyme was the first reported 
HHDH displaying unexpectedly high activity on cyclic as well as other sterically demanding 
internal epoxide substrates, owing to its much broader and more solventexposed active site 
compared to other HHDHs.42,4547 Since its discovery in 2017, a few more Gtype HHDHs have 
been characterized, all displaying similar substrate scopes as HheG.13,47,48 Despite this 
appealing activity towards bulky epoxides, HheG as well as other Gtype members also come 
with some limitations including their insufficient stability for industrial application as well as 
an only moderate enantioselectivity.37,42,47 The first challenge, the poor (thermal) stability of 
HheG, was already addressed by us through protein engineering as well as 
immobilization.37,49,50 Thus, we could demonstrate that the exchange of residue T123 in HheG 
by aromatic amino acids or glycine resulted in variants with up to 14 K higher apparent melting 
temperature as well as increased activity, most likely through regulating the dynamics of an N
terminal loop spanning residues 3947 (Figure 1B).37 Interestingly, a slight increase in the 
enantioselectivity of those HheG variants was observed as well.
