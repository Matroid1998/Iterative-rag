Description:
Located at 4b Wyckoff sites in the ordered P4332 phase of LMNO.

Text:
Mn3 gives rise to pronounced JahnTeller (JT) distortion and Mn dis
solution via disproportionation reactions (2Mn3 Mn2  Mn4) leading to structural
instability.2,68
Depending on synthesis conditions, LMNO can show site disorder in the octahedral TM
cation sites (see Figure 1).9 A lower synthesisanneal temperature (700 C) leads to the
formation of the ordered (P4332) phase, where Ni and Mn are located at 4b and 12d Wyckoff
sites.1012 In the ideal P4332 LMNO, all Mn species present as redoxinactive Mn4. The
Ni2Ni4 couple gives rise to a distinctive voltage at 4.7 V.4 Higher synthesis tempera
tures ( 700 C) promote the formation of the Fd3m LMNO with Mn and Ni disordered
across the 16d sites.
