Description:
Has a crystal lattice that can incorporate aluminum to improve oxidation resistance.

Text:
However, easy oxidation of TiN already at temperatures of 500550 C, and its
inherent brittleness restrict the eld of its possible application in extreme thermal and mechanical
conditions.19,20
An effective method of increasing TiN oxidation resistance is its alloying with aluminum. Since
aluminum (as titanium) can form an fcc crystal phase,21 it substitutes for titanium in the crystal
lattice of the nitride.
