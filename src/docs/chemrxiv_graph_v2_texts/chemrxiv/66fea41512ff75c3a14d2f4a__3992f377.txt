2.4  2.6 eV) and 
good stability under typical operating conditions in aqueous 
solutions.4,5 When compared with other metal oxides, such as 
Fe2O3, BiVO4 exhibits charge carrier lifetimes that are four 
orders of magnitude higher, and hole diffusion length one or
der of magnitude longer.68 Nevertheless, pristine BiVO4 still 
suffers from poor bulk electronic conductivity, ineffective hole 
extraction, and slow rate of water oxidation.6,9 As a result, the 
reported photocurrent densities at nonmodified BiVO4 are 
typically much lower than the maximum theoretical value of 
6.4  8.9 mA cm2 under AM 1.5G illumination, corresponding 
to maximum solartoH2 conversion efficiencies of 8
11.10,11 Thus, designing straightforward, scalable strategies 
to overcome these drawbacks of BiVO4 materials represents 
an important research agenda.

cessfully designed a photoanode by depositing a thin film of 
cationic polyelectrolytes and anionic CoPOMWOCs on the 
surface of various photoelectrode materials (e.g. Fe2O3, BiVO4 
and TiO2) for improving the PEC performance as well as sta
bility.19 Fan and coworkers reported CoPOM as a novel mo
lecular cocatalyst deposited on Ndoped carbon (NC) to 
boost the charge separation and injection of BiVO4 pho
toanodes for PEC water oxidation.20 Some of us have recently 
reported a direct linking of CoPOMs to the surface of Mo
doped BiVO4 photoanodes.
