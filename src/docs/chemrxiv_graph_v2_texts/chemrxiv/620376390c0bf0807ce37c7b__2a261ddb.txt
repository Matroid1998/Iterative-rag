Description:
A derivative of carbonyl compounds that exhibits nucleophilicity at the alpha carbon.

Text:
The introduction of functional groups at the a carbon of carbonyl compounds is a common transformation in 
synthetic organic chemistry. aFunctionalized ketones are substructures found in many natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, and other functional organic compounds.1 The functionalization reaction relies on the inherent 
nucleophilicity of the a carbon of the enol (or enolate) derivative of the carbonyl compound, which reacts with an 
electrophilic reaction partner in this process. Many carbonbased electrophiles can be used, leading to the 
formation of CC bonds,2 but the use of heteroatomic electrophiles becomes challenging. This is due to the high 
reactivity, and therefore limited functionalgroup compatibility of these species.

Description:
A derivative that can react with nucleophiles.

Text:
They are typically strong oxidants, 
and this can lead to the formation of byproducts, such as overfunctionalized or oxidized compounds.3 The 
structural variety of these species is also limited, and it is difficult to reconcile this with the idea of producing 
structurally diverse target compounds. Nevertheless, there are a number of heteroatomic electrophiles that can be 
used in such reactions, designed for specific transformations and with specific functionalgroup tolerances.4 
 An alternative approach is to use nucleophiles rather than electrophiles to react with enol derivatives.

Description:
A derivative that can undergo homocoupling reactions.

Text:
In this way, side reactions 
such as homocoupling of the enol derivative or afunctionalization with other nucleophiles derived from the I(III) 
reagent (e.g., OAc) are minimized.9a Using this protocol, Szpilman et.
