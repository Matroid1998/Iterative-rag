Description:
A representative compound of simple PASHs absorbing UVA radiation.

This is an im
portant subject of investigation, which can provide structure
photoreactivity relationships relevant to understanding the pho
tochemical fate of PASHs in the environment, as well as, for 
tuning their photochemical properties for rational technological 
applications714. S

Scheme 1. Structures of dibenzothiophene (green), 4
methyldibenzothiophene 
(orange), 
and 
4,6dimethyldi
benzothiophene (pink). In this study, dibenzothiophene (DBT), 4methyldibenzothio
phene 
(4MDBT), 
and 
4,6dimethyldibenzothiophene 
(46DMDBT) are chosen as representative compounds of simple 
PASHs absorbing UVA radiation (Scheme 1). We combine 
steadystate absorption, emission, and femtosecond broadband 
transient absorption measurements with quantumchemical cal
culations to unravel their electronic relaxation pathways upon 
excitation in the UVA spectral region of the electromagnetic 
spectrum. 2
