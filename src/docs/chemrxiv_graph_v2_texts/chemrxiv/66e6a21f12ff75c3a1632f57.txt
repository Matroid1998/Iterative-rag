Description:
Forms complexes with tetradentate ligands that can oxidize strong CH bonds in a stereospecific manner.

In this context, 
the most promising candidates to develop enantioselective CH oxidation reactions are iron and 
manganese complexes containing tetradentate ligands due to their ability to oxidize strong CH bonds 
in a stereospecific manner.1720 
Traditional optimization protocols in stereoselective oxidation reactions often mimic aspects 
of highthroughput experimentation (HTE) techniques, a resourceintensive and timeconsuming 
method. In this regard, systematic modification of the properties of the species involved in the system 
can be regarded as an alternative strategy for reaction optimization whichusing a simple trial and 
error approachhas found use in asymmetric epoxidation21 and CH oxidation reactions22 developed 
with this type of catalysts. While in some instances satisfactory performance has been achieved from 
these approaches, limited mechanistic information regarding the factors controlling the activity and 
selectivity has been attained.
