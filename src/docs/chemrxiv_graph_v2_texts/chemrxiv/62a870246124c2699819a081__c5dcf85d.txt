Description:
A relatively inert gaseous oxide of carbon that is difficult to reduce.

Text:
Carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are both gaseous oxides of carbon which result from 
industrial activities and are major contributors to air pollution. The conversion of CO and CO2 to their 
reduced forms is an environmentally benign option to access valuable Cbased chemicals which are 
generally derived from fossil fuels.13 While CO is relatively inert and difficult to reduce, efforts on 
fixing CO2 by its chemical and electrochemical reduction has seen a steady growth in the recent years 
as the reduction of CO2 also addresses the global concerns regarding the likely deleterious effects of 
increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere e.g.
