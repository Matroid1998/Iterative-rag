Description:
An undesired product in side reactions during CO2 reduction.

Text:
One of the current most pressing scientific challenges is the development of selective 
catalysts for the reduction of CO2, which would enable us to process CO2 more efficiently and 
at smaller costs.13 Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction seems to be the most promising direction4
6 and many catalysts are currently being developed.712 Optimization of their structures has 
led to impressively improved properties,1317 but the low selectivity with regard to undesired 
side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, remains problematic.
