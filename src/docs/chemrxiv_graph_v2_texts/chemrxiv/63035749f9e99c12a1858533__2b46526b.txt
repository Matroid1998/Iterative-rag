Studied for their photophysics and photochemistry.

The
synthesis,
characterisation
and
spectroscopic
study of Rhenium(I) carbonyl complexes bearing di
imine ligands has been an active field of research in
the last decades. Since their introduction by Wrighton
and coworkers,13 and pioneering work by Lehn and co
workers,4 they have gained enormous popularity thanks
to their widespread use as CO2 reduction catalysts,510
and photosensitisers.1122
In our previous work, some of us have reported on
the photophysics and photochemistry of different Rhe
nium(I) 2N tricarbonyl (Scheme 1, 1),23 and 3N 
dicarbonyl terpyridine complexes (Scheme 1, 2),24 based
on a 4(4substitutedphenyl)2,26,2terpyridine lig
and. The groups of Castellano,25, Sullivan,26 Dempsey,27
Ishitani,28 and others2931 have studied different rhe
nium(I) dicarbonyl complexes with diimine ligands, in
terms of their ground and excitedstate properties.
