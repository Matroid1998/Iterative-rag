Description:
Octahedra that form the structural basis of niobium oxyfluorides.

This approach offers a route towards tuning composition while maintaining the 
cationic interactions important for many properties, however, the number of such materials is currently 
limited.9 Niobium oxyfluorides are one particular class of mixedanionic materials of interest for functional 
applications the variable oxidation state of niobium; similar ionic radii of oxygen and fluorine; and higher 
covalency of NbO bonds cf. NbF bonds leads to direct control of physical properties through variable 
oxygenfluorine ratios. These materials are built around cornersharing Nb(O,F)6 octahedra, with a number 
of shearrelated phases also known.1012 The simplest structure observed in the family is that of cubic ReO3
