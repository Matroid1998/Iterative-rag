Description:
A fuel produced from water splitting, used to store renewable energy.

Text:
The water splitting reaction provides a promising method to store intermittent renewable energy 
resources in the form of hydrogen fuel.1,2 Currently the bottleneck of water splitting is its oxidative 
half reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which has a high thermodynamic potential 
and is kinetically sluggish due to the involvement of four consecutive electrons and protons 
transfer steps.35 Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop heterogeneous OER 
catalysts composed of earthabundant metals.47 However, the heterogeneous nature of these 
catalysts makes it difficult to probe the nature of their active sites.
