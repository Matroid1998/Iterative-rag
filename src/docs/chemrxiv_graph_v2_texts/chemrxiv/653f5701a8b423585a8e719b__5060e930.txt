Description:
Unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds that are activated by gold catalysts.

Furthermore, the 
palladium (or nickel or copper) catalysts strong catalytic 
reactivity limits the tolerance of many functional groups 
in these crosscoupling products. In the past two decades, homogeneous gold catalysis 
has emerged as an attractive research field for its high 
catalytic efficiency, favorable functionalgroup compati
bility, and good biocompatibility.4 Gold catalysts have 
been widely used for activation of unsaturated carbon
carbon bonds, particularly alkynes. Due to the higher 
redox potential of gold AuIIIAuI (1.41) than that of 
PdIIPd0 (0.99), achieving the crosscoupling reactions on 
gold is a nontrivial task. Recent studies have utilized 
external oxidants,5a,5g EBX reagents,5b,5m strain re
lease,5d photochemistry,5b,5c,5h ligand design5d,6 and 
electro photochemistry7 to promote the otherwise slug
gish oxidative addition to gold(I) complexes.
