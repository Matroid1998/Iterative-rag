addition, the application of pressure can have an impact on the ionic conductivity of solid 
43 
electrolytes since compression results in a lowering of the accessible volume for ions. A 
44 
representative example for the effect on crystal structure on the pressure dependence of ionic 
45 
conductivity is (Li, Na, K)Al2O3. While the conductivity of LiAl2O3 has a positive correlation 
46 
with pressure, the mobility of larger Naions in Al2O3 is mostly indifferent to pressure 
47 
changes. On the contrary, increasing the ionic radius as in KAl2O3 results in a negative 
48 
correlation with pressure.
