Description:
A yet not identified phase discovered in the form of nanocrystals.

These materials share the general formula PbaEbXc, and only four stable 
compositions are known in bulk (PbTeF6, Pb7S2Br10, Pb5S2I6, Pb4SeBr6),28,29 together with two recently 
reported highpressure metastable phases (Pb4S3I2, Pb3Se2Br2).30,31 Our group pioneered the investigation 
of lead chalcohalides at the nanoscale, discovering two additional compounds (Pb4S3Br2 and a yet not 
identified PbSCl phase) in the form of NCs.25 More recently, we found that Pb4S3Br2 can match epitax
ially the CsPbX3 perovskite to form colloidal heterostructures, thus demonstrating a remarkable synthetic 
and structural compatibility.26 Here we focus our attention on the lead sulfochlorides, demonstrating that 
the yet unknown PbSCl phase obtained through direct synthesis is Pb3S2Cl2, whose structure, here iden
tified as monoclinic and solved for the first time, is a distorted version of the cubic Pb3Se2Br2 prototype 
(Figure 1, left panels).31 Conversely, the introduction of CsPbCl3 nanoclusters in the reaction medium, 
under comparable reaction conditions, produces Pb4S3Cl2CsPbCl3 heterostructures while suppressing the 
formation of Pb3S2Cl2.
