Description:
A possible metal component in the A2M2TeO6 family of fast ion conductors.

Text:
Recently, we developed an
interatomic potential model for a family of fast ion
conductorsA2M2TeO6 (A  Li, Na, or K ; M  Ni,
Zn, Co, or Mg) 37, 38to perform MD studies that
represent the structural and dynamical properties re
ported in the experiments and present several interest
ing behaviors such as energydriven or entropydriven
diusion depending on the concentration of the mobile
ions. Our previous work on A2Ni2TeO6 (A  Li, Na, or
K) 38 showed how cationic distribution and the energy
landscape vary with increasing interlayer distance. The
study also showed that ionic conductivity increases expo
nentially with increasing interlayer distance. Moreover,
