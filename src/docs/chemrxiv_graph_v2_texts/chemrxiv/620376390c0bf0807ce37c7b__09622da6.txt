Description:
Species observed using 13C NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
al elegantly observed Oenolonium species 
for the first time using 13C NMR spectroscopy.9a The formation of byproducts is closely related to the outstanding 
leaving ability of the I(III) functional group (106 better than triflate).10 
 In general, the nature of the second nucleophile is somewhat limited, but excellent results have been reported 
for arylations,9b, 9c, 9e,11 azidations,7c cyanations,7b and acetoxylations.7d,8,12 The somewhat narrow scope is partly 
due to the fact that the nucleophile may need to be incorporated into the structure of the I(III) reagent.7b,11,12,13 
General methods for the intermolecular reaction of ketones or enol derivatives with a variety of nucleophiles, using 
a nondesigner I(III) reagent, are scarce.
