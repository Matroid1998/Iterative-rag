Description:
An inorganic perovskite with high thermal stability and moisture resistance.

Text:
Despite a huge improvement in stability has been 
achieved 19 devices available today are far from the objective of a marketable device. The previously mentioned limiting factors have drawn the attention to inorganic perovskites since it is 
expected that the inorganic absorbers can increase the stability of photovoltaic devices2022. Up to now the 
most explored alternative has been CsPbI3, due to its high thermal stability and moisture resistance22,23, 
1.7 eV direct bandgap at room temperature22,24,25 (the most suitable of the inorganic lead halide perovskites 
(LHPs) for photovoltaic applications), high carrier mobility 26 and shallow defects enabling defect tolerance 
2729. Since its first use as absorbing layer in a planar configuration perovskite solar cells (PSC) achieving 
2.9 energy conversion25.
