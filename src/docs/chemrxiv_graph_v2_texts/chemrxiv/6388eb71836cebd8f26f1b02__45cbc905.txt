Description:
A gas that plays an important role in climate change and can be reused in industrial chemical processes.

can also play an important role in climate change and the
development of capture strategies is interesting not just for
environmental concerns but also for the possibility of reusing
them in other industrial chemical processes. 17
Hofmannlike clathrates with general formula Fe(pz)M(CN)4
(pz  pyrazine, M  Ni, Pd, Pt) 18 are a versatile class of
MOFs with octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) centers con
nected by cyanide ligands, CN, to a squareplanar open
metal site, M(II). The resulting FeMII(CN)4layers are
pillared by bidentated aromatic ligands resulting in three
dimensional networks. These materials are interesting for
gas capture applications due to the combination of open
metal M(II) sites and bistable Fe(II) spincrossover centers.
