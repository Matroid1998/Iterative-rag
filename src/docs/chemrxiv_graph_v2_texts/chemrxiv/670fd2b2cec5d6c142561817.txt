Description:
A 3D perovskite with signature XRD peaks at (110) and (220).

light blue data is the final measurement after complete gas evacuation from the microwell. (D) Illustration 
of 2DPA1 spincoating process on MAPbI3 3D perovskite to assess its inhibition of O2 and H2O (red circles) 
permeation. (EF) XRD spectra of MAPbI3 films that were (E) uncoated and (F) coated with at 60nm 2DPA
1 film. Stacked panels show the change in spectra with respect to time exposed to ambient air. The (110) 
and (220) peaks represent signature peaks of MAPbI3. The (001) peak represents the signature peak of 
the degradation byproduct, PbI2. Insets are optical images of the perovskite films over time. SiSiO2
