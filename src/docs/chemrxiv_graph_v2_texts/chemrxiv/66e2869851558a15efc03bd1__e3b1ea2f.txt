Description:
Used as a high-k gate oxide in silicon-based transistors.

This means their 
only chance for reacting is with surface moieties, formed by surface reactions with the 
previous precursor and the surface. This builds a material, ideally, atomic layer by atomic 
layer with great precision. ALD was first patented 19746 and has been crucial to the 
semiconductor industry since the early 2000s when ALD proved to be the enabler for the 
highk transistors, where HfO2 deposited by ALD replaced thermally grown SiO2 as the 
gate oxide in siliconbased transistors.7 ALD is now used to deposit a wide range of 
materials, for example oxides, nitrides, sulfides, metals, and even organic and polymer 
films.
