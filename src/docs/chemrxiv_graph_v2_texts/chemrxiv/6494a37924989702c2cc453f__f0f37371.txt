Description:
A stable radical with behaviour analogous to nitric oxide, effective in antibiofouling applications and potential use in chronic wound treatment.

Text:
. Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in several 
biological processes, from biofilm inhibition1 to 
controlling inflammation2 and cancer treatment3. However, NO is intrinsically unstable, and interest in 
stable radicals with analogous behaviour, such as (2,2,6,6
tetramethylpiperidin1yl)oxyl (TEMPO) has rapidly 
grown. The TEMPO molecule, as shown in Figure 1a, 
has been reported as effective in antibiofouling 
applications49, with its potential for use in chronic 
wound treatment also highlighted9. In high doses, 
TEMPO is lethal to bacterial cells and biofilms8. In low 
doses, it enters the cell5,6 and mimics nitric oxide 
behaviour as a signalling molecule, including, for 
instance, causing P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersion by 
reverting sessile cells to a planktonic state through the 
overstimulation of twitching motility5.
