Description:
Forms complexes with a response specific to an analyte based on lanthanide(III) centered interaction.

Text:
Lanthanide luminescence has the unique photophysical combination of a millisecond luminescence lifetime and a 
high photoluminescence quantum yield.1 This gives rise to unique applications in bioassay and bioimaging.211 
Furthermore the luminescence lifetime depends on quenching by water,1214 and the spectral shape can be 
changed by modulation of the ligand field.1519 This can beand has beenused extensively to create 
lanthanide(III) complexes with a response specific to an analyte.7,2029 The basis of the response is a lanthanide(III) 
centred interaction, which we are not able to describe to an adequate degree.

Description:
A host that binds to oxyanions, with binding mechanisms influenced by pH and media composition.

Text:
In particular, as there exists a large literature on the synthesis of various derivatives of lanthanides azamacrocyclic 
complexes that bind to oxyanions.23,27,32,4251 
The mechanism of binding between a lanthanide(III) host and an oxyanion guest is most readily described in 
the scenario where the host is neutral and ion pairing effects can be ignored. Figure 1 shows this case, the equilibria 
involved, and the potential competitive binding events that change as a function of pH and media composition. Figure 1 includes two scenarios a europium(III) complex formed from a 7dentate ligand that create ternary
