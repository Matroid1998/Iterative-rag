Description:
A reactive atmosphere used in thermal treatment to yield isolated metal sites or nanoparticles.

For example, there are ongoing debates 
regarding whether the RhFe alloy or RhFeOx interfaces are crucial for promoting ethanol 
synthesis.13, 14, 16, 17 
In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) has emerged as a powerful 
synthetic methodology to generate tailored catalysts and to interrogate the role of composition 
and interfaces.1820 Specifically, SOMC exploits the surface termination of oxide supports, 
especially surface OH groups, MSOH, to anchor welldefined metal precursors, LnMXx 
through protonolysis, generating atomically dispersed surface species, MSOMLnXx1 (ca. 1 
sitenm2) while releasing HX. Subsequent thermal treatment under vacuum or reactive 
atmospheres like H2 can yield isolated metal sites or nanoparticles with tailored compositions 
or interfaces. Overall, SOMC generates welldefined models of heterogeneous catalysts, where 
each component can be selectively introduced and their state probed through detailed 
characterization.
