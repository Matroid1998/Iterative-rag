Description:
Mycotoxins that cause liver carcinogenicity.

(2022), who simultaneously assessed 
more than eighty chemicals with known affinity to the estrogen 
receptor in relevant biological specimens (blood, urine and breast 
milk). The vast physicochemical diversity of xenobiotics also implies 
widely varying toxicological effects on humans. The adverse impact 
of, e.g. mycotoxins, a group of fungal food toxins, range from liver 
carcinogenicity 
(aflatoxins), 
nephrotoxicity 
(ochratoxin 
A), 
estrogenicity (zearalenone) to inhibition of protein synthesis and 
mitochondrial function (trichothecenes) (Marin et al. 2013). Xenoestrogens may immensely impact hormone homeostasis and 
endocrine disruption, especially in critical time windows, since they 
interfere with the endocrine system, partly even at extremely low
