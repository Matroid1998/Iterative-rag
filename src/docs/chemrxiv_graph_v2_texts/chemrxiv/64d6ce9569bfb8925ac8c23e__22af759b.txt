Description:
A cathode material used in lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Lithiumion batteries have been the gold standard and ubiquitous driving force behind almost
all electronic devices for over two decades.1,2 A typical lithiumion battery consist of a
graphite anode, a transition metal oxide cathode, and an electrically insulating and ionically
conducting nonaqueous organic electrolyte that acts as an ionic path between the two.3,4
One key to understanding a batterys electrochemistry is its electrodeelectrolyte interface,
which controls critical aspects of performance and is thus a target for improvement.5,6 The
decomposition of organic electrolyte molecules at the electrode surface yields a passivation
