Description:
Forms the basis of tectosilicates in zeolite structures.

Text:
While zeolites typically crystallize as threedimensional (3D) fully connected framework materials,4 
called tectosilicates when silica based,5 there exist examples of layered zeolite precursors that only 
form the final zeolite by a postsynthetic 2D3D topotactic condensation.6,7 The 2D layered precursors 
have been shown to also offer the opportunity to produce expanded versions of the corresponding 
zeolite by an intralayer expansion reaction of the layered precursor with a silylating agent.8,9,10 This 
reaction introduces Si atoms between the layers, thus increasing the number of Si members in the ring 
limiting the pores.11 The obtained materials are called Interlayered Expanded Zeolites (IEZ), although
we propose to use a different acronym, ILEZ, for reasons that will be obvious below.

Description:
The polymorph of lowest density ever reported in the form of ZEO3 zeolite.

Text:
ILEZ materials 
are interrupted frameworks rather than true zeolites because dangling SiR or SiOH groups remain in 
the final asmade and calcined materials, respectively.12,13 Very recently, we have reported the first 
case of a 1Dto3D topotactic condensation of a complex chain silicate zeolite precursor (ZEO2) into 
the extralarge pore ZEO3 zeolite, which was at that time the silica polymorph of lowest density ever 
reported.2 ZEO3 has a 3D system of pores open through rings containing 16, 14, and 14 tetrahedra 
(161414 membered ring, MR). Here we report that it is possible to introduce silicon between the 
chains of ZEO2, resulting in what we call Interchain Expanded Zeolites (IChEZ).
