Cellulosic biomass is considered as one of the abundant and easily available renewable 
44 
source of multipurpose raw materials able to deliver a span of biobased platform molecules, 
45 
that are compounds that can be catalytically transformed into a wide spectrum of useful 
46 
chemical derivatives.14 A paramount example of lignocellulosic biomassderived platform 
47 
molecule is 5(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), sometimes referred to as a sleeping giant due 
48 
to its high synthetic potential.56 Both reductive and oxidative approach are viable options for 
49 
the catalytic valorization of HMF, with the former having a much broader prospects. 50
