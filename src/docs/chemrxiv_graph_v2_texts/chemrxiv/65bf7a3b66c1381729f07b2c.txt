Besides biodegradability, for successful medical applications, other material properties such as 
biocompatibility, bioactivity, carefully considered mechanical properties, and processability needs to be 
considered during the design and fabrication process. By addressing these properties diligently, it becomes 
possible to develop medical devices that not only exhibit sustainability and biodegradability but also fulfill 
the functional requirements for effective medical applications5, 6. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is a polyester derived from biobased monomers and is receiving 
an increasing attention for its potential biomedical applications due to its good biocompatibility and 
biodegradability7. These properties make it suitable for various biomedical applications, including drug 
delivery systems and medical devices8, 9. Tissue engineering is the most widely researched biomedical 
field for PBS application where different forms (films, scaffolds) are being developed8.
