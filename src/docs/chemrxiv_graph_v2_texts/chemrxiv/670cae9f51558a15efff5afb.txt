Description:
A preservative used in the pharmaceutical industry to prevent microbial growth.

Text:
Sodium benzoate (SB) is a preservative that is used a lot in the pharmaceutical industry and other 
areas 1. Due to its ability to prevent microbes from growing, it is often used to make products 
last longer like other preservatives 2. However, SB biodegraded easily 3 and not 
environmentally persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPPs), referring to pharmaceuticals that 
stay in the environment for a long time 46. Although SB is generally biodegradable, the rate of 
degradation is contingent upon the particular circumstances and concentrations present. This 
generates concern over the potential adverse impacts on both human beings and ecosystems. Sodium benzoate (C6H5COONa) is an organic sodium salt derived from benzoic acid, where a 
sodium ion replaces a proton from the carboxy group.
