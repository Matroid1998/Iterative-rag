Description:
Abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, and participates in a wide range of transformations due to its various oxidation states from 0 to 7.

One of the central challenges of our century is the develop
ment of sustainable chemical processes.1 Following this 
concept, the use of first row transition metals has become 
essential in catalysis.2 Manganese is abundant, inexpensive, 
nontoxic, and participates in myriad of transformations 
due to the wide range of oxidation states it can adopt (from 
0 to 7, Ar3d54s2).3 In the framework of a new research 
programm dedicated to manganese catalysis, we are 
particularly interested in the systematic study of reactions 
previously neglected due to low practicality and lack of 
mechanistic understanding.
