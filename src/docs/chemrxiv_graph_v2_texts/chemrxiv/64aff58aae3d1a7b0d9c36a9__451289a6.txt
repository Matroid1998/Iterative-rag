Description:
Its decreasing ratio within the spinel structure is balanced by the reduction of Mn4 to Mn3.

Text:
This phenomenon also causes the partial reduction of 
Mn4 into Mn3 to balance the decreasing NiMn ratio within the 
spinel structure. Thus, the disordered LNMO is composed of 
LiNi20.5Mn3,41.5O4. The material is commonly reannealed at 
a lower temperature (700C) to homogenize it and reoxidize 
Mn3 into Mn4 to obtain the stoichiometric and ordered LNMO 
LiNi20.5Mn41.5O4.5 Regarding electrochemical performance, the 
disordered phase usually exhibits higher electronic conductivity 
due to manganese mixed valence, better structural stability and 
higher specific capacity, especially at high rates and for longterm 
cycling.6 As rocksalt impurity tends to be located at the surface of 
disordered phase primary particles,710 Not only does it hinder ac
cess to the full electrochemical capacity of spinel, but it also leads 
to misleading investigations of surface reactivity.
