Description:
Analyzed using ICP-MS in alkaline media to determine its concentration in water samples.

Text:
In Israel, desalinated water is a major source of drinking water. Previous studies have suggested that the levels of iodine in water provided by authorities may 
not accurately reflect the levels reaching endusers. Materials and Methods. We analyzed 21 tap water samples collected from different 
localities across Israel, 13 posttreated desalinated water samples from three of the largest 
Israeli desalination plants, and several natural water samples. An improved method of ICP
MS developed in our laboratory was used to analyze the content of iodine and other macro
elements, and determination of iodine was performed in alkaline media. Results Our results showed that it is possible to distinguish between sample groups 
based on iodine concentration, water hardness, and CaMg ratio.

Description:
Present in tap water at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 12.3 gL, lower than previously reported levels in Israel.

Text:
The median iodine 
concentrations for four groups of tap water samples ranged from 0.3 to 12.3 gL, which is 
lower than the concentrations previously reported by other researchers in Israel. Based on 
typical consumption, the water samples can provide no more than 3.39 of the recommended 
dietary allowance level for iodine. The analysis of posttreated desalinated water samples 
indicated that these waters comply with industrial specifications but contain only trace 
concentrations of iodine and much less magnesium than recommended by different public 
health authorities for public consumption of drinking water. Conclusion The total iodine concentrations found were lower than several 
observations reported in previous years in the literature. There are currently no strict
