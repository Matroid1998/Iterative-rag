With increasing the world population, the demand for quality life and food also increased. But 
48 
during the past few years, the approaches for the efficient management of fertilizers for the 
49 
production of required food quantity are facing persistent challenges in view of the world 
50 
population especially in developing countries like Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In Pakistan, 
51 
most farmers used nitrogenbased fertilizer due to the deficiency of nitrogen in soil 1, 2. 52 
Nitrogen (N) is found abundantly in the atmosphere but in this form, it is inaccessible for plants. 53 
It became only available when primary producers such as plants are converted dinitrogen gas 
54 
into ammonia (NH3).

Though, nitrogencontaining fertilizers gained special attention in this 
55 
regard because nitrogen (N) is one of the vital and mandatory plant elements for crop 
56 
development and growth. However, granular urea is one of the commonly used fertilizers in 
57 
the agriculture section because it was economical and easy to produce, which is almost five 
58 
times greater frequently used fertilizer than ammonium nitrate. During the past few decades, 
59 
the utilization of urea has become very high due to their nitrogenbased fertilizer containing 
60 
ability (which is 46 of world consumption), high foliage production, low corrosion capacity, 
61 
and highwater solubility 3, 4. Accumulated data revealed that urea is hydrolytically very 
62 
stable and possesses a nonenzymatic halflife of about 3.6 years 5.
