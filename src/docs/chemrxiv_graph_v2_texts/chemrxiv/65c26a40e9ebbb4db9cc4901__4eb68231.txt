Therefore, there is still strong interest in discovering 
new classes of visiblelightabsorbing dHAT photocata
lysts that provide bondcleaving and forming capabilities 
complementary to the existing ones. Metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs), such as CdS 
and CdSe, are semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable 
electronic and optical characteristics by their sizes. Recent
ly, QDs have emerged as powerful photocatalysts in organ
ic synthesis.3036 For example, CdS QDs were found to be a 
potent photoreductant with a reduction potential  3.4 V 
vs SCE due to the Auger process of excited QDs.37 Moreo
ver, the van der Waals interactions between the CdS sur
face and carboxylatebearing substrates enable selective 
intermolecular 22 photocycloadditions.31, 3839 In addi
