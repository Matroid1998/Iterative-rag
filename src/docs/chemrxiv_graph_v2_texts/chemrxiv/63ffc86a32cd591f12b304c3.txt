Anthropogenic methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) 1 with an estimated 20 year global
28
warming potential 8487 times that of CO2,2 is emitted from oil and gas facilities, waste
29
management, agricultural processes, and landuse practices. Curbing methane emissions
30
across all sectors is crucial to nearterm climate change mitigation. While the importance
31
of mitigating methane emissions is well recognized, measuring these emissions from natural
32
gas facilities remains a challenge, due to the vast extent of natural gas infrastructure and
33
the temporal variability of emission sources. 38
34
Recent private and public investments have driven improved methane emission measure
35
ments.
