Compounds with a unique hexacyclic ring system posing synthetic challenges.

To the best of our knowledge, this renders 2 one of only five natural MIAs (out of 3,000) to 
contain a cyclopropane.6 From a synthetic perspective, its unique 656635 hexacyclic ring system presents challenges not 
readily addressed via existing approaches to the sarpagine alkaloids. In addition, preliminary biological testing has shown 
rauvomine B (2) to be among the most active of its congeners in antiinflammatory screens, displaying inhibition of RAW 
264.7 macrophages (IC50  39.6 M; positive control, celecoxib IC50  34.3 M).1 Inspired by the unique structure of 
rauvomine B (2) and seeking to develop a new synthetic entry to the sarpagine family for further biological screening, we 
embarked upon a total synthesis of 2.

Alkaloids with challenging structures and diverse biological properties.

The sarpagine alkaloids, as well as their biosynthetically related macroline and ajmaline congeners, have proven 
popular targets for the synthetic community based on their challenging structures and diverse biological properties. Such 
studies began with early (semi)syntheses by Sakai7 and Magnus,8 and were significantly expanded by numerous total 
syntheses reported by the Cook group and others over the subsequent three decades.918 Continued interest in the family has 
been showcased in a series of creative approaches developed in the past five years.1926 Despite this rich body of work, 
synthetic approaches capable of addressing the particular structural challenges presented by rauvomines AC (13) are yet 
to be developed.
