significant component of the renewable feedstock utilized in FDCA production. Plantbased 
feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, and forest residues, serve as valuable sources 
for hexose production.3These plant materials undergo biomass conversion and biorefining processes 
to extract and hydrolyze the complex carbohydrates into their constituent hexose monomers. The 
utilization of FDCA, in conjunction with various monomers, has been extensively explored and 
documented in numerous published papers and approaches.413 Notably, significant attention has been 
dedicated to the development of semicrystalline polyesters and copolyesters. These materials possess 
several advantageous features and find prevalent applications as engineering, packaging, textile, and 
elastomeric materials.14,15
