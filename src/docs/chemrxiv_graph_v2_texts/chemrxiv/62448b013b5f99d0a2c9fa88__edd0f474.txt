Description:
Reduces wear by forming protective tribofilms on rubbing steel surfaces.

The development of more sustainable lubricants with tailored tribological performance is a 
crucial activity in the pursuit of net zero greenhouse gas emissions.1 Modern lubricants consist 
of a mixture of base oils, which are most often nonpolar hydrocarbons, blended with several 
different types of additives, which can be polar organic molecules, polymers, or organometallic 
compounds.2 Probably the most important of these additives is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate 
(ZDDP), which was originally developed as an antioxidant, but is now used primarily for its 
remarkable antiwear performance.3 ZDDP reduces wear by forming protective tribofilms on 
rubbing steel surfaces.3 Despite decades of research and development to find a more 
environmentallyfriendly alternative,4 ZDDP remains ubiquitous in engine lubricants.
