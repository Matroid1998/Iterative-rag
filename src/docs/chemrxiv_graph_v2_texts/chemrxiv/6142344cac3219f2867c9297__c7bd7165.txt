Description:
A compound used in protein chemistry for bioconjugation due to its reactive double bond and high selectivity towards cysteine residues.

Text:
Maleimidederivatives are among the mostly used in protein chemistry, polymer chemistry 
and functional group transformation mainly due to its double bond is very reactive and can 
undergo chain extension reaction12. In protein chemistry it is used for bioconjugation3, due 
to 
exceptionally 
fast 
reaction 
rates 
and 
significantly 
high 
selectivity 
towards cysteine4 residues in proteins, a large variety of maleimide heterobifunctional 
reagents are used for the preparation of targeted therapeutics5, PET6. Bradykinin

Description:
Used as dienophiles in cycloaddition reactions.

Text:
Secondly, maleimides, 
particularly the bismaleimides are used for synthesis of selfhealing polymers1617, self
assembled functional telechelics and modular block copolymers18, reactive and functional 
polymers19 such as click chemistry2022. Maleimide derivatives are also used in chemicals 
applications such as dienophiles in cycloaddition reactions23, Thia Paterno Buchi Reaction24 
CH activation25 and functionalized basic maleimides26 are few of them.
