Description:
Hosts used in aqueous host-guest systems for binding affinity studies.

If 
the free energy changes associated with these dehydration events is erroneous, it will be difficult to 
compute an accurate binding affinity. Simple problems also require less conformational sampling, by e.g., 
molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, so they maximize the precision of the results and are 
relatively inexpensive to compute, enabling broader participation and testing of more methodologies. In the spirit of assigning simple but informative computational challenges, SAMPL has, since 2012, 
challenged computational chemists to predict the affinities of aqueous hostguest systems(6,8), for hosts 
that include cucurbiturils(913), deep cavity cavitands(14,15), cyclodextrins(1618) (CDs), and derivatives 
thereof.
