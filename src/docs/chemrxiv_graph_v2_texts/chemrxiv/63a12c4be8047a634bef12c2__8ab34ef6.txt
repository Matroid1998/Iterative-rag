Description:
An active material with ionizable groups used in moisture-induced electricity generators.

Text:
One type is moistureinduced electricity generators (MIEGs),20, 21 which generate electricity based 
on the interaction between ubiquitous moisture and active materials with ionizable groups such as 
graphene oxide (GO),2225 carboxylated cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs),26, 27 and polyelectrolytes.28 
The generated voltage of MIEGs is generally explained as the potential difference induced by 
directional ion diffusion across the film of the active material.29 For example, Qu et al.
