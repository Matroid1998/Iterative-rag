Description:
An anion whose reduced flow through epithelial cell membranes in the lungs is associated with cystic fibrosis.

Text:
Anion transport is an essential cellular function facilitated by membranebound ion channels.1 Diseases in which genetic 
problems affect the structure of ion channels and hence reduce or stop the flow of anions through the membrane are known as 
channelopathies and include cystic fibrosis (CF).2,3 In CF, reduction in the flow of chloride and bicarbonate through epithelial 
cell membranes in the lungs limits water osmosis, which leads to the formation of sticky mucus and continual lung infections, 
reducing the life expectancy of CF patients.4,5 It has been proposed that small molecules which can facilitate anion transport 
through cell membranes, known as a channel replacement therapy, may ameliorate the symptoms of CF and other 
channelopathies by replacing the function of faulty channels.6 
Small molecule anion transporters can dissipate pH gradients across lipid bilayer membranes.
