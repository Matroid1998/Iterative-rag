Description:
Involved in the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the anode of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers.

Text:
Protonexchangemembrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) provide an attractive solution for 
producing hydrogen from carbonneutral energy sources. 1 However, the kinetically sluggish 
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode causes severe energy losses, requiring 
the development of active and stable electrocatalysts. 2 The strongly acidic and oxidizing anode 
environment restricts the choice of catalyst materials to the oxides of platinumgroup metals 
(PGM), with iridium oxides being the current stateoftheart. 2 Due to the scarcity and cost of

iridium, largescale deployment of PEMWE technologies could face an iridium supply 
bottleneck.
