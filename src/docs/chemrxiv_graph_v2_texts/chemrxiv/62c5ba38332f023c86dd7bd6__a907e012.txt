Description:
Fully saturated four-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles.

Text:
Fourmembered nitrogencontaining heterocycles (Fig. 1A) 
have recently gained increased interest and popularity for their 
potential as underexplored biologically active compounds. While azetidines (1) represent fully saturated fourmembered 
Nheterocycles, azetines (2, 3), also known as dihydroazetes, 
are their corresponding counterparts with one unit of 
unsaturation. Specifically, 1azetines (2) contain an imine 
functional group with a double bond between the nitrogen 
atom and the neighbouring carbon atom. In comparison, 2
azetines (3) incorporate a carboncarbon double bond in the 
heterocycle.

Description:
Four-membered N-heterocycles known for their three-dimensionality and increased metabolic stability.

Text:
Much of the focus in the area of synthesis and 
reactivity of fourmembered Nheterocycles has been on 
azetidines (1), which offer a variety of advantages compared to 
larger ring heterocycles including three dimensionality, 
increased metabolic stability,13 and potential as bioisosteres 
for other Nheterocycles such as pyridines.46 Although access 
to azetidines and azetines has historically been challenging, 
interest in functionalized azetidines has rapidly heightened due 
to recent synthetic advances.1,2 While development of 
methods to access azetines has been more limited, the field has 
seen a recent rise in popularity with the development of five 
new synthetic methods since 2018.712 Azetidines and azetines 
share desirable physical properties including high ringstrain 
and the potential to serve as bioisosteres; however, these four
membered heterocycles have important differences in their 
inherent reactivity, making azetines highly desirable synthetic 
targets.

In comparison to azetidines (1), incorporating exclusively 
sp3hybridized carbons, the azetine scaffold (2, 3) includes two 
sp2hybridized centers, which are responsible for their distinct
