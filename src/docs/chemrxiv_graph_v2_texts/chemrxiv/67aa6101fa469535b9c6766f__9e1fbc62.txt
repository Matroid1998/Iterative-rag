Description:
Used in catalysis, particularly in magnetization transfer catalysis known as SABRE.

Text:
Complexes of iridium find applications in various fields of catalysis,811 one special ap
plication is magnetization transfer catalysis in the process termed SABRE (signal amplifi
cation by reversible exchange).12 In SABRE, nuclear spin order of parahydrogen (pH2) is
transferred to magnetization of target molecules via exchange that can lead to an increase in
polarization, and, thus, to an enhancement of NMR signals by several orders of magnitude. Hyperpolarization techniques are particularly suitable in combination with benchtop NMR
spectrometers.1315 For SABREbased hyperpolarization, polarization transfer is facilitated
through a scalar coupling network between hydrides and nuclei in ligated target molecules
that bind to the same polarization transfer catalyst (PTC).1618
Our paper is centered around acetonitrile (ACN) as a target molecule of SABRE polar
ization.
