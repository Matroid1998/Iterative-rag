Description:
A directing group that assists in transition metal catalysis for CH activation.

Text:
With the increasing demands of deuterium labelling in pharmaceutical and material science,1 the development of 
novel deuteration strategies had been urged to provide deuterated compounds with various structures and 
divergent labelling sites. Among the methods established,2 hydrogenisotope exchange (HIE) has attracted 
considerable attention as an ideal and intuitive route, in which insitu replacing the protium with deuterium occurs. With the recent booming of CH activation,3 the HIE has been boosted by transition metal catalysis,4 especially with 
the assistance of directing groups such as carbonyl, pyridyl, and amide.2c In contrast, the selective deuteration of 
compounds without strong directing groups remain challenging due to lack of anchoring position.
