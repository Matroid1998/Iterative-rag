Description:
A perfluorinated methyl group.

Text:
with a few noted exceptions, any chemical with at 
least a perfluorinated methyl group (CF3) or a perfluorinated methylene group (CF2) is a PFAS. While early research efforts focused mainly on a very limited list of PFAS, the number of documented 
PFAS are increasing. With the emergence of high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and the potential 
for socalled suspect screening for contaminants of interest using nontarget analytical techniques4,5, 
more extensive lists of PFAS became available. The first PFAS list hosted by the NORMAN Suspect List 
Exchange6,7 (hereafter NORMANSLE) was the 2015 list contributed by Trier et al.8, which became the basis 
for the OECD list of 4700 PFAS released in 20179,10. The NORMANSLE currently (June 2023) contains 
twelve PFAS lists6,7.
