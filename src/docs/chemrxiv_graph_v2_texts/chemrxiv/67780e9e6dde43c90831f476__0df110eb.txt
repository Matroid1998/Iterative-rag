Description:
A promising element for sustainable production through photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Text:
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) has garnered significant attention in recent years as a 
promising method for sustainable hydrogen production. Among the various strategies employed, 
singleatom photocatalysis stands out as an innovative approach 1. In singleatom photocatalysis, 
metal atoms are isolated and anchored on a support material, allowing for the maximum exposure 
of active sites 2. This unique configuration facilitates highly efficient light absorption and 
electron transfer, making singleatom photocatalysts (SACs) particularly valuable in the HER 
process. Their ability to function effectively under ambient conditions, coupled with the possibility 
of tuning their electronic properties through careful material design, has positioned SACs as a 
critical component in advancing hydrogen production technologies 3.

Produced through optimized charge carrier dynamics in organic materials.

The charge 
carrier dynamics, such as efficient charge separation and transfer, are optimized through the careful 
design of organic materials, allowing for better hydrogen production rates 10. Furthermore, 
heteroatom doping, such as introducing nitrogen or sulfur into the organic structure, has been 
shown to significantly improve the electronic properties and the stability of the photocatalysts, 
enabling longterm hydrogen evolution without significant degradation 11. Despite their promising properties, organic photocatalysts face several challenges that hinder their 
efficiency in HER 1215. One major issue is the low stability of many organic materials under 
harsh photocatalytic conditions, particularly in aqueous environments 16. These materials are 
susceptible to photocorrosion, which can reduce their lifetime and effectiveness over time.
