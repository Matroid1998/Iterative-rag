Description:
A sterically hindered complex used in ECD spectra studies.

Thus, in 
flexible molecules with multiple chiral centers this becomes a 
complicated and timedemanding 
task.2a 
Moreover, 
the 
corresponding conformational search, determination of conformer 
populations, and ECD spectra simulation have their limits of 
accuracy.2a,4 
Porphyrins7 
have 
featured 
widely 
in 
studies 
on 
chirogenesis and sensing1,4 and are suitable test beds for 
validating analytical tools. In this work the ECD spectra of a 
sterically 
hindered 
hexacationic

complex with two enantiomers of camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) as 
chiral guests (Figure 1), were experimentally and computationally
