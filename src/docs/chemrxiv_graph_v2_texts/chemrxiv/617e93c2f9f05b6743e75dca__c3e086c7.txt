Description:
Macrocyclic N ligands used in the organometallic chemistry of iron.

Text:
The organometallic chemistry of iron has been dominated by strongfield supporting 
ligands such as CO, CN, and phosphines, and by macrocyclic N ligands like porphyrins.16 The 
active sites of hydrogenase enzymes incorporate Sbased ligands, and these are lowspin due to 
the influence of carbonyl and cyanide donors.7 However, the interesting reactions of nitrogenase 
enzymes, and a new generation of lowvalent iron catalysts, have predominantly weakfield 
ligands and have led to increasing interest in organometallic iron complexes with higher spin 
states.811 We focus here on iron coordination environments that result from a mixture of C and S 
donors  choices that are particularly compelling since the six belt iron atoms in the iron
molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) of nitrogenase have a mixed CS coordination sphere.1214 This 
unusual combination of potentially strongfield C donors and weakfield S donors could lead to 
changes in spin states during catalysis, which has been linked to changes in barriers and 
selectivity.1518 Thus, the study of C and Sligated iron has relevance for both fundamental 
coordination chemistry and bioinorganic mechanisms.1921 However, COfree iron complexes with 
supporting ligands that coordinate through only carbon and sulfur donors are rare.2228 Of these 
examples, only one multidentate CS ligand is known to support N2 binding.26 In addition, Qu has 
provided important studies on Cpsupported iron dimers bridged by dithiolates, and this CS 
ligand sphere can bind and facilitate the reduction of nitrogenaserelevant NxHy substrates.2325, 29 
Our groups recent work on SCS systems began with a dithiolate ligand having a central 
arene that can interact with iron through backbonding into its system in low oxidation states.26, 
30 While this hemilabile interaction stabilizes the reduced complexes, complete dissociation of the 
SCS ligand occurred in the presence of Brnsted acids, and backbonding into N2 competed with 
backbonding into the arene.
