Description:
Can be excited to generate a diradical intermediate.

Text:
By utilizing the photoinduced energy transfer course, 
Glorius6a and Brown6b groups respectively described ele
gant cycloaddition of BCBs and alkenes toward bicy
clo2.1.1hexanes. The reaction was initiated by the excita
tion of either alkene or BCB to generate a diradical interme
diate. Li7a and Wang7c groups developed a borylpyridine 
catalytic system to activate BCB as a cyclobutyl radical in
termediate.

Description:
An electron-deficient compound that can be inserted into BCB using SmI2.

Text:
Meanwhile, Procter group applied SmI2 as a sin
gle electron reductant to achieve the insertion of electron
deficient alkene into BCB (Scheme 1b1).7b Very recently, 
Zheng group described a Ticatalyzed formal cycloaddition 
of BCB and 2azadienes to synthesize aminobicy
clo2.1.1hexanes.7e Lately, Glorius accomplished the cou
pling of phenol and BCB by leveraging a photoredox pro
cess.7d All the reactions above entailed the generation of 
radical species, which to some extent limited the substrate 
scope. Bicyclo1.1.0butanes could be activated as an enolate 
nucleophile upon central bond cleavage mediated by 
Lewis acid to attack electrophilic reagents such as aryl al
dimine by Leitch group,8a aldehyde by Glorius group,8c or 
ketene by Studer group,8b followed by the intramolecular 
cyclization to complete the formal cycloadditions.
