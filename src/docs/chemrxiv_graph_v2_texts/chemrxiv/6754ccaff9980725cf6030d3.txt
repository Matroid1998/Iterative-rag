Description:
A reactive species involved in oxidative processes, including singlet oxygen used in photodynamic therapy.

The ability of compounds to generate various reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen, is attracting the 
attention from researchers across multiple fields. These 
compounds, known as photosensitizers, exploit the high oxidative 
potential of ROS and have found diverse applications in medicine. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photodynamic inactivation 
(PDI) already being actively employed for the treatment of 
tumors1,2, bacterial3 and fungal4,5 infections. In addition, the use 
of photosensitizers is also promising for antiviral therapy6. The antiviral mechanism of photosensitizers relies on the 
generation of singlet oxygen. When a lipophilic dye is 
incorporated into the viral membrane, it localizes near 
unsaturated lipids. Upon light exposure, the photosensitizer 
produces singlet oxygen, which oxidizes the double bonds of fatty 
acid residues, thereby compromising the integrity of the viral 
envelope.
