Description:
Compounds whose hydrogen atoms can be replaced with fluorine to form perfluorocycloparaphenylenes.

1a, top left) can be obtained from the addition of fluorine to 
the unsaturated bonds of fullerenes, but these are virtually the only examples of highly 
strained perfluoroarenes15. Although Suzuki and coworkers have shown that 
perfluororubrene (Fig. 1a, top right) possesses a twisted structure with a slight strain16, 
a method to apply more strain to perfluoroarenes has not yet been reported. Here, we report the synthesis of perfluorocycloparaphenylenes (PFCPPs), a class 
of highly strained ringshaped perfluoroarenes (Fig. 1a, bottom) in which all hydrogen 
atoms of the corresponding cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs)1719 are replaced with 
fluorine atoms. This replacement of hydrogen with fluorine can be expected to result 
in a significant change of the structural and electronic properties of the PFCPPs20.
