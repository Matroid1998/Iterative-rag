Description:
Part of the conserved histidine brace motif at the active site of LPMOs, ligating mononuclear copper.

Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases 
(LPMOs) are the representative copperdependent enzyme fam
ily that play a critical role in the degradation of polysaccharides, 
particularly in the breakdown of recalcitrant polysaccharides 
such as cellulose and chitin.111 Structurally, LPMO retains the 
conserved histidine brace motif at the active site, where the 
mononuclear copper is ligated to three N sites of two histidine 
residues (Figure 1A and 1B).6, 1216 LPMOs were initially iden
tified to be O2dependent oxidases, which can mediate the CH 
(BDE95 kcalmol) hydroxylation of polysaccharides via the 
external reductantassisted oxygen activation process (Figure 
1A).1721 In addition, it was found that LPMOs can use the H2O2 
cosubstrate to perform preoxygenations on polysaccharides, 
for which the preactivation of LPMOs by an external reducing 
agent is required.13, 2225 Interestingly, O2dependent activity of 
LPMOs can generate the H2O2 intermediate in the presence of 
reducing agent (e.g.
