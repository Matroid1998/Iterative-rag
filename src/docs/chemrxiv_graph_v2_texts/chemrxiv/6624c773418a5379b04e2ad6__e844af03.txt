Description:
Part of the Pd(I) dimer (PtBu3)PdBr2, which functions as a reservoir for Pd(0) species.

Text:
Pd(I) is the least understood oxidationstate for palla
dium species.18 However, in recent years, Pd(I) species have 
received increasing attention for their roles in Pdcatalyzed 
organic transformations.9,10 A number of dimeric Pd(I) com
pounds have proved effective catalysts for crosscoupling 
reactions.8,1115 As a notable example, the Pd(I) dimer 
(PtBu3)PdBr2 can function as the reservoir of the highly re
active 12electron Pd(0) species and has been applied as 
precatalysts for an array of CC and CN bond crosscoupling 
reactions.8,16 Mononuclear Pd(I) species are invoked as pu
tative intermediates in Pdcatalyzed halogenatomtransfer 
reactions,1720 
carbonylation 
reactions,21,22 
crosscou
plings,2328 as well as lightdriven Pdcatalyzed reactions.29
31 In these catalytic reactions, singleelectron redox reac
tions between Pd(0) species and organic halides and light
driven decomposition of Pd(II) species are proposed to 
yield Pd(I) intermediates.

Description:
A supporting ligand for two-coordinate Pd(I) complexes.

Text:
The transient nature of these 
mononuclear Pd(I) intermediates, however, prevents isola
tion and detailed characterization. So far, isolable mononuclear Pd(I) complexes are exceed
ingly rare. Figure 1 lists the known examples. The PtBu3
supported twocoordinate Pd(I) complexes Pd(PtBu3)2X 
(I, X  CB11H12, PF6)32,33 reported independently by Chaplins 
and Ozerovs groups in 2016 were prepared by singleelec
tron oxidation of the Pd(0) complex Pd(PtBu3)2 with fer
rocenium or triphenylmethyl cation. In similar way, the two
coordinate Pd(I) complexes with PAd3 and Nheterocyclic 
carbene as supporting ligands Pd(PAd3)2BArF4 (II, ArF  
3,5(CF3)2C6H3)34 and Pd(IPr)2PF6 (III, IPr  1,3bis(2,6
diisopropylphenyl)imidazole2ylidene)35 were prepared 
by oxidizing the corresponding Pd(0) precursors. The reac
tivity of the homoleptic Pd(I) complexes IIII remains poorly 
understood.
