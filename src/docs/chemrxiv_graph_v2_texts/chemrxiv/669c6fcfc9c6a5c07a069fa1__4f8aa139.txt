Description:
Returns to its ground state after radiative decay and exhibits a fluorescence peak around 490 nm when bound in the active site of the luciferase protein.

turns to its ground state (HFOH, I5) after radiative decay.29 Fi
nally, HFOH can rapidly convert to the oxidized flavin mono
nucleotide (FMN) species via a dehydration reaction, which can 
be further transformed to FMNH to initiate another lumines
cence process.30 
HFOH exhibits a fluorescence peak around 490 nm when 
bound in the active site of the luciferase protein.30 However, it 
is unstable and readily converts to FMN with the loss of one 
water molecule in solution, as shown in Scheme 1. Conse
quently, N(5)alkylated 4ahydroxy flavins are commonly used 
as experimental models to mimic HFOH.
