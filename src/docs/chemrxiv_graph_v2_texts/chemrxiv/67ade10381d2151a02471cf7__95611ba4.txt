Description:
A two-dimensional material with high surface area, excellent electronic conductivity, tunable Van der Waals gap, and unique layer-dependent properties.

Text:
Among these, one approach 
involves the use of twodimensional (2D) materials and their innovative components particularly 
phosphorene, due to its high surface area, excellent electronic conductivity, tunable Van der Waals 
gap and unique layerdependent properties.4
