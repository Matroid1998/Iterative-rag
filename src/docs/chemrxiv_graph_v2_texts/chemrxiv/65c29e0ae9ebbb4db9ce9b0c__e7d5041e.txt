Description:
Forms nanobelts with orientable surfaces in three-dimensional space.

An additional example of a topological property is the ori
entability of a surface in the threedimensional space. While 
the two surfaces of CPPs or carbon nanobelts are orientable, 
an analogous macrocycle twisted by 180 along its circum
ference resembles a Mbius strip, a structure with a non
orientable surface. The interest in the latter type of struc
tures emerged after the seminal work of Heilbronner in 
1964,18 who predicted that annulenes with systems of 4n 
electrons that could be mapped onto a Mbius strip dis
played a phase inversion in the electron system and pos
sessed the same resonance stabilization as nontwisted ar
omatic annulenes with (4n2) electrons.
