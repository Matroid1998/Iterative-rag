Unexpectedly, chemists almost did not use aliphatic 
trifluoromethyl diazirines before. Moreover, these compounds 
were mostly unknown from the synthetic standpoint. We could find 
only three single molecules in the literature with a linear aliphatic 
CF3diazirine motif,2729 while cyclic molecules were not reported. Aliphatic difluoromethylsubstituted diazirines were completely 
unknown. Presumably, the lack of synthetic efforts to fluoroalkyl 
aliphatic diazirines led to the inability of biochemists to 
systematically study them, and use them as photoaffinity labels. No 
one made them, and no one could use them.
