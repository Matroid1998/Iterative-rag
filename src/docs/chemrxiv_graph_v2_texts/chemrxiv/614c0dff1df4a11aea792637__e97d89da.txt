erature cites multiple studies in both theoretical and experimental verticals across various
catalyst classes discussing methane activation. For example, it has been investigated on
supported metal clusters,5 noble metal surfaces,69 mixedmetal alloys,10 zeolites,11 metal
organic frameworks(MOFs),12 metal oxides,1315 perovskite,16 and supported singleatom
