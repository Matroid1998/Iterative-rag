Description:
Used in fabrication technologies to facilitate the miniaturization of chemical reaction control.

Text:
Several solutions for multiplexed combinatorial chemistry are 
currently available, providing microarrays based on the deprotection 
of optical labile8 or acidbase labile9 groups achieved by imaging or 
with the encapsulation of chemical monomers for micro printing 
strategies. However, these platforms still lack throughput and 
versatility to reach a widespread use for different applications that 
would benefit from the control of combinatorial chemistry at a large 
multiplexing scale. Electrochemically generated acid was also used 
for the generation of microarrays9,10. Electrochemical strategies, in 
addition to facilitate the electronic management, can ease the 
miniaturization of the control of chemical reactions using Silicon 
fabrication technologies that would allow a costeffective production 
of chips to facilitate the access to the technology11.
