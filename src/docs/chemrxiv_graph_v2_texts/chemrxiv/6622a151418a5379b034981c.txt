Description:
An element that, along with carbon, forms the structure of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Text:
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large class of
molecules that consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Each PAH
contains at least two rings, of which at least one is aromatic. These
molecules play an important role in astrochemistry since they are
estimated to account for about 10 of all galactic carbon.1,2 PAHs
can also form in combustion reactions of fossil fuels, which lead
to the presence of PAHs in the Earths atmosphere. Here, they
act as environmental pollutants, and they impact the health of the
population.3,4 In the interstellar medium (ISM) and planetary at
mospheres, PAHs are subjected to highenergy particles.58 There
fore, investigating PAHs radiation and photoinduced chemistry is a
compelling study with broad implications.
