Description:
An important solvent and the starting material for many other products.

The utilisation of alternative feedstocks for everyday chemicals is
of key industrial importance as we move towards net zero and
beyond. Methanol derived from various carbon sources, such as
CO2, biomass, and biogas, is already of considerable economic
interest.1 The methanoltohydrocarbon (MTH) process is poised
to offer a pathway to numerous commercially and industrially
significant chemicals. The first step in the MTH process, the de
hydration of methanol to dimethyl ether (DME), is of particular
interest as DME is an important solvent and the starting material
for many other products.
