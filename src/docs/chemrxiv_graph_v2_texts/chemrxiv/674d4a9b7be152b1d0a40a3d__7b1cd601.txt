Description:
Used in the arylation of alkylsubstituted aldehydes.

Text:
It is known 
that monomeric coordination complexes of lowvalent niobium, 
such as NbCl4L2, are paramagnetic 21. Another synthetic finding of 
the use of metal compounds from the VB group is presented in this 
study. We have, for the first time, performed a highly selective 
arylation of alkylsubstituted aldehydes using benzene, under the 
action of a system of reagents consisting of TaCl5 and Mg 
.
