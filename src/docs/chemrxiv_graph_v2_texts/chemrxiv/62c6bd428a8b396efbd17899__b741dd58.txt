Redox-active organic compounds used as CO2 carriers with high binding affinities towards CO2.

Conventional carbon
capture technology involves wet chemical scrubbing us
ing aqueous amines to absorb CO2 at industrial sources
or directly from the air for further sequestration.4 This
strategy, however, has many limitations including low ca
pacities, poor oxidative stability, degradation in presence
of contaminants and large thermal energy demand for
absorbent regeneration.46 In the search for new mate

approach.710 A popular strategy is to use redoxactive
organic compounds as CO2 carriers, with quinones being
the most representative class of compounds.11 Electro
chemical reduction of quinones generates oxyanion nu
cleophiles, which have high binding affinities towards
CO2 and have been reported to concentrate and selec
tively separate CO2.1116 The biggest advantage is that
quinones can be electrochemically regenerated, leading to
energy savings over traditional temperature or pressure
swing processes.

questions
remain about the molecular mechanism of this process
and whether it is possible to increase its oxidative
stability by carefully tuning the electron density of the
quinones. In the presence of oxygen (O2), it is observed
that there is a loss in CO2 capture ability17 as reduced
quinones can be reoxidised while O2 is reduced.18 If
quinone structures are tuned to have sufficiently positive
reduction potentials by substitution of functional groups
on the aromatic rings, it may be possible to avoid the
sidereactions with O2. However, by tuning the redox
potentials, one will also change the CO2 capturing
