POMs are polynuclear, 
anionic, metaloxo clusters, typically composed of W, Mo, V, 
or Nb centers in their high oxidation states bridged by oxygen 
atoms.8 Their exceptional compositional and structural variety 
makes their properties highly tunable,9,10 and of interest for bio
applications.1116 NH3Pri6Mo7O24, for example, has been 
well explored for its anticancer activity It has been proposed 
that the activity of NH3Pri6Mo7O24 arises from the reduction 
and reoxidation of molybdenum centers in the cells.1725 
Although typically predicted to be less active than 
polyoxomolybdates,8,25 polyoxotungstates have also been 
extensively investigated as anticancer agents.13,14,26 
On the other hand, the application of POMs as bioactive 
agents can be hindered by their instability at physiological 
pH.2628 This makes evidencing and controlling the active 
species in the cells difficult.29 Therefore, in this work, we 
screened diverse small (polyoxo)tungstates for their structure
dependent anticancer activity, namely Na2WO4, PW12O403 
PW12, PW9O349 PW9, NaP5W30O11014 (NaP5W30), 
and Co4(H2O)2(PW9O34)210 (Co4(PW9)2).
