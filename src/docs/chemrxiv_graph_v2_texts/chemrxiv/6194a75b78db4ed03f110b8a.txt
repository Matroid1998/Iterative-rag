Description:
Involved in slow kinetics of evolution and reduction reactions on air cathodes.

Text:
In search for concepts to develop the next generation of
batteries with comparable or even superior performances
than existing devices, zincair batteries (ZABs) belong
to the most promising approaches 13. However, in
spite of the many advantageous features, one of the basic
problems for its use is the slow kinetics of oxygen evo
lution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) on the
air cathodes 1. In recent years, many eorts have been
devoted to solve this problem by nding new electrocat
alysts with suciently high activities to promote both
reactions 2, 49. Manganese and cobalt oxides are natural candidates
to enhance OER and ORR because of their role in the
water oxidation in many biological systems, their multi
ple oxidation states, natural abundance, and inexpensive
costs 6, 1012.
