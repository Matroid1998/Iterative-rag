Description:
A highly selective cancer drug derived from an unselective fragment.

Text:
Fragment approaches have established themselves over the last few decades as a powerful approach for 
interrogating drug targets and discovering new biologically active compounds in a relatively short time.1,2 By 
the end of 2021 there were 6 fragmentderived drugs in the clinic in order of approval Zelboraf 
(vemurafenib),3 Venetoclax (ABT199),4 Erdafitinib,5 Pexidartinib (PLX2297),6 Sotorasib (AMG510)7 and 
Asciminib (ABL001).8 Two of these moved through the drug discovery pipeline relatively quickly Zelboraf 
progressed from an unselective fragment to a highly selective cancer drug in the span of 6 years; and Sotorasib 
took 8 years from a publication,9 demonstrating the druggability of its target KRASG12C to an FDA approved 
drug.
