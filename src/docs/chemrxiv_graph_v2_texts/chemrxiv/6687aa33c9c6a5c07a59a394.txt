Description:
Vacancies are relatively mobile and prefer accumulation at neutral domain walls.

Text:
Electronic structure along with the en
ergetics and mobility of point defects are calculated and the pos
sibility of reversibly tuning between n and ptype conductivity at
DWs is evaluated. Both Li and O vacancies are found to be rela
tively mobile and to prefer accumulation at neutral DWs, where
they can reversibly induce p and ntype conductivity, respectively. Finally, possible experimental realisation of this potential by ther
mal annealing and applied electric fields is discussed. Journal Name, year, vol.,19  1
