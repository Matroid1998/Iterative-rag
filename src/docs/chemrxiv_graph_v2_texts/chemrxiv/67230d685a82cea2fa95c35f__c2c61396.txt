Description:
The most commonly used amine for CO2 scrubbing, developed in the early 1900s, known for its volatility and corrosiveness.

Since 
1930, aminebased systems have achieved multimegaton per 
year worldwide capacity, primarily used for natural gas 
scrubbing.3 Reaching Gtyear capacity necessitates extending 
to other CO2emitting industries. However, amines have 
struggled to gain traction in these sectors due to their cost, 
which arises from their high process energy consumption, 
need for steam as an energy transfer medium, and high 
degradation rates. The most commonly used amine, 
monoethanolamine (MEA), which was developed in the early 
1900s, requires 3.67 GJton CO2 depending on plant 
configuration,2 and degrades rapidly,19,20 in addition to being 
volatile and corrosive.
