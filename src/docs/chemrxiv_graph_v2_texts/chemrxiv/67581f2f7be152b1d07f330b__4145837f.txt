Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily arising from fossil fuel combustion in 
automobiles and industrial plants, makes up for the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions 
and is the largest contributor to global warming 1, 2. Aiming to mitigate CO2 emissions into 
the atmosphere, it has been proposed to develop and implement CO2 conversion and utilization 
(CCU) as an important part of CO2 management strategies. Among the topmost CO2 catalytic 
conversion processes, the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, socalled CO2 methanation or Sabatier 
reaction, is particularly promising because of its favorable thermodynamics. Additionally, the 
transportation of CH4 is readily feasible through existing infrastructure of natural gas pipelines 
35. Ultimately, it can pave the way for achieving a carbonneutral energy balance via the 
process referred to as PowertoGas (PtG).
