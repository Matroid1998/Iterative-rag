Description:
A material used in quantum dots for lighting, displays, and optoelectronic technologies.

Text:
Indium phosphide quantum dots (QDs) are a promising alternative to traditional Cd and Pb based 
materials for lighting, displays, and optoelectronic technologies13. However, due to its increased 
covalency, limitations in easily accessible precursors, and inherent distinctions in precursor reactivity and 
valency, the synthesis of InP has been met by more challenges when compared to their IIVI and IVVI 
counterparts in terms of extracting generalizable design principles and targeted properties4. Since the first 
InP QD synthesis in 1994 that reported the use of chloroindium oxalate combined with 
tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine (P(TMS)3) in a mixture of trioctylphosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine 
oxide (TOPO) using a heatup method5, intense effort has been devoted to exploring new synthetic 
methodologies and new precursors (Figure 1).
