Description:
Used in batteries with solid-state polymer electrolytes to suppress dendrite formation.

Text:
Additionally, the 
propagation of Li dendrites brings more safety concerns.34 Solidstate polymer 
electrolytes (SPEs) provide an alternative choice for the lithium batteries with their 
excellent processability and the ability to suppress lithium dendrite.5 The concept of 
SPEs was firstly reported by Wright and coworkers in 1973.6 They discovered that 
alkali metal salts can be dissolved in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to form conductive 
complexes.
