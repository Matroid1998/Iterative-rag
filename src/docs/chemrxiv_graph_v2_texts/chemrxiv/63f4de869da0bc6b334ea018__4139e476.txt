Description:
Peripheral chains in asphaltenes.

Text:
Asphaltenes are made of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon rings with peripheral alkane chains 
(Mullins et al., 2012) and are among the most surfaceactive and polarizable components of 
crude oil. They are characterized as a solubility class that is insoluble in nheptane but soluble 
in aromatics such as toluene. Molecular structure analysis using atomic force and scanning 
tunneling microscopy methods show polydisperse asphaltenes with a variety of molecular 
structures (Schuler et al., 2015). Following the widely accepted YenMullins model for 
asphaltenes, the average molecular weight of a molecule is around 750 gmol and the 
asphaltenes can exist as a monomer, nano aggregate or clusters based on their concentration 
in oil (Mullins, et al., 2010; Mullins et al., 2012).
