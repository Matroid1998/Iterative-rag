Description:
A metal that undergoes a sharp transition around the critical point in supercritical conditions.

Text:
At lower alkali metal concentrations, the
resulting deep blue solutions contain localised solvated
electrons and dielectrons,1,35 which found practical ap
plication as reducing agents for the hydrogenation of aro
matic hydrocarbons within the Birch reduction process.6
At higher concentrations, as the excess electrons become
delocalised, the solution turns into a liquid metal with
a characteristic golden metallic sheen and conductivity
comparable to that of copper.1,4,5
Models of the nonmetaltometal transition in liquid
systems go back to the work of Landau and Zeldovich
in the 1940s7 and have been experimentally tested on
supercritical mercury or alkali metals numerous times.8
The emerging picture has been that of a sharp transi
tion occurring around the critical point, at which metal
clusters of sufficient size are formed in the dense super
critical vapour.

Description:
Supercritical mercury does not exhibit a sharp transition in certain conditions.

Text:
In contrast to su
percritical mercury,8 alkali metals dissolved in liquid am
monia do not exhibit a sharp transition, but a gradual one
in the concentration range of about 110 MPM (mole per
cent metal; in liquid ammonia, 1 MPM equals to roughly
0.4 M).2,5
Three historical models have been suggested for the
EMT in alkali metalliquid ammonia systems2 (i) a per
colation model based on experimental findings of micro
scopic inhomogeneities,9 (ii) an extension of the Landau
and Zeldovich model introducing a critical electron den
sity for metallisation,10,11 and (iii) a model linking the
transition to a polarisation catastrophe.12 Despite these
efforts, the molecular mechanism underlying the EMT
remains inconclusive.
