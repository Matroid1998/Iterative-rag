Description:
A compound involved in difunctionalization to form two neighboring chemical bonds in a single transformation.

Text:
The rapid and efficient construction of molecular complexity from 
readily available starting materials has long been a fundamental 
pursuit in organic synthesis. In recent decades, transitionmetal ca
talysis, photocatalysis, and electrosynthesis have emerged as pow
erful strategies for alkene difunctionalization, enabling the con
struction of two neighboring chemical bonds in a single transfor
mation (Figure 1A, i).1 Among these vicinal difunctionalizations, 
alkene 1,2aryl heteroatom functionalization is of particular interest 
as it enables straightforward and stepeconomic synthesis of struc
turally diverse products by introducing a CX bond (X  N, O, S, 
halogens, etc.) and a CC(sp2) bond simultaneously.2 Furthermore, 
the incorporation of the 1,2aryl heteroatomic motif has demon
strated enhancement in bioefficacy and therapeutic potential, ren
dering it a privileged scaffold in pharmaceutical development3 
(Figure 1B).
