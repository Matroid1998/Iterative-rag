Additional condition optimizations in terms of copper salts, base additives, and solvents (Supplementary 
Table 1) revealed the optimal conditions (entry 8) as follows NS1 (0.20 mmol) and S1 (1.5 equiv.) in the 
presence of Cu(MeCN)4PF6 (10 mol), L7 (10 mol), and K3PO4 (3.0 equiv.) in mixed DMEMTBE 
(vv 13, 4.0 ml) at r.t. for 5 days under argon, giving N1 in 80 yield with 93 e.e. Table 1  Effect of chiral ligands
