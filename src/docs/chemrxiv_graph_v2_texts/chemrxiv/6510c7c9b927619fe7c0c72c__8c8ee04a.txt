Description:
A building block used in the addition of nitrene equivalents for aziridination.

Text:
Of these, the addition of a nitrene 
equivalent across an alkene is the most attractive, due to 
the simplicity of the disconnection and the availability of 
alkene building blocks. While catalytic methods have been 
developed 
using 
organocatalysts,10 
transition 
metal 
catalyzed methods have remained the predominant means 
of accessing chiral aziridines through this disconnection. Following seminal work by Evans1112 and Jacobsen,13 
development of Cu(II) catalyzed methodologies have 
received the most attention using discreet or in situ 
generated hypervalent iminoiodinane nitrene sources.1418 
Since then, other methodologies have been developed 
using Ru(II),1921 Co(II),2223 Rh(II),2426 Fe(II),27 Mn(III),28 
and Ag(I),29 along with a variety of unique ligand designs 
and 
nitrene 
sources, 
enabling 
both 
intra 
and 
intermolecular stereoselective aziridinations.
