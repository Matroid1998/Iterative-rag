a lesser extent, they have been explored as battery anodes,22, 23 in hydrogen storage2426 or catalysis.27 
Within the compositional and structural variability of the LaNiSi system, multiple 
compounds form closely related groups,2831 of which two homologous series based on AlB2type 
building 
blocks 
attracted 
our 
attention, 
namely 
La(n1)(n2)Nin(n1)2Sin(n1)32 
and 
Lan(n1)xNin(n5)ySi(n1)(n2)z14 with the clear exchange of the formal cationic and the anionic 
components. These two series represent practically isostructural compositional mirrors, i.e. La and 
Nirich reflections. While Lnrich representatives were observed before, Nirich ones were known 
only for pnictides (solely P and As)14 and appeared as a surprise. Moreover, their mutual appearance 
in the same system was unprecedented. Therefore, we decided to expand our investigation into related 
systems with heavier lanthanides.
