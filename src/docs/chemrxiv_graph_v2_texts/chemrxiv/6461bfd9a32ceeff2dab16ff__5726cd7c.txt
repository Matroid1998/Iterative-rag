Description:
A versatile cation with modifiable alkyl chain lengths on nitrogen atoms, used in developing solvents and ionic liquids.

Text:
One of the most investigated cations is imidazolium Im due to its
particular properties such as the ease with which the alkyl chain length can be modified on
15
the nitrogen atoms of the Im ring, being an interesting option to develop more solvents
by combining it with different anions, using the same basic structure for the cation.1 The
versatility of Im cation is one of the reasons why Imbased ILs are some of the most
employed ILs in industrial applications.13
The vast possibilities for synthesizing ionic liquid pairs results in the quandary of deter
20
mining these compounds properties at a reasonable time and cost.
