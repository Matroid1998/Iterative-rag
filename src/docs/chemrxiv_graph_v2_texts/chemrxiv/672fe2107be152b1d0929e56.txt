Description:
Functional groups commonly used in radical crosscoupling reactions.

Text:
The use of radical crosscoupling in retrosynthetic analysis has experienced a renaissance 
over the past decade (14). This is due to the simple, convergent disconnections of challenging C
C bonds leading back to everpresent functional groups such as halides, acids, amines, alcohols, 
and olefins (Figure 1A) (412). In practice, all of these widely employed radical precursors require 
some sort of exogenous redox activation mode. Regardless of the choice of oxidative or reductive 
activation, this generally requires stoichiometric chemical additives, catalysts to facilitate photo
induced electron transfer, or electrochemistry (5, 8, 13). A simpler means to achieve radical cross
coupling without the use of exogenous redox methods would be highly attractive based on first 
principles reasoning as it would reduce cost and the complexity of reaction setup.
