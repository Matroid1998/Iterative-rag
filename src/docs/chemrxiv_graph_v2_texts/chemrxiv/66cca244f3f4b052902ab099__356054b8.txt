Description:
Ethylenepolar monomer used in copolymerization with ethylene.

Text:
For instance, freeradical polymerization can 
be applied in the production of ethylenepolar monomer (e.g., acrylates, acrylic acid, 
vinyl acetate) copolymers, this method encounters the substantial difference of 
reactivity ratios between ethylene and polar vinyl monomers and leads to random 
polymers with low molecular weights and chains containing a significant amount of 
branches.46 Moreover, in coordination polymerization the polar groups act 
detrimentally to the transitionmetal catalysts, primarily due to the poisoning of the 
catalysts.713 In this scenario, the innovation of advanced strategies to produce the 
polyolefins consisting of polar blocks in accurate sequence control is highly 
desirable.1418 
Designing new olefins by integration of polar moieties into nonpolar olefins 
backbone transforms the original copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl
