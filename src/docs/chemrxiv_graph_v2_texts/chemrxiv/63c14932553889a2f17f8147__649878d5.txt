Description:
Compounds that can be hydrolyzed under reflux in water.

Text:
Dione 2 can then undergo an intramolecular photochemical 22 cycloaddition, which 
is promoted by the use of either a highpowered Hg lamp or a UVB lamp (exc  311 
nm) under acidic conditions and has been successfully scaledup using continuous flow 
photochemistry.13 After being refluxed in water to hydrolyse any methyl ketals, 3 can 
then be transformed into the cubane scaffold using a Favorskii rearrangement to give 
cubane1,4dicarboxylic acid 4, which is then esterified and isolated as 1.
