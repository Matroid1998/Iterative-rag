Description:
A compound targeted for reduction reactions to convert it into value-added products.

Text:
A carbonneutral, or even 
negative, cycle demands viable approaches to capture and convert CO2 into compounds with 
added value.2,3 Consequently, a great deal of research is ongoing toward means to promote the 
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).4,5 Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) of the 
general formula MX2 (M 4 or 5 metal, XSTe) constitute a class of compounds attracting 
interest for this purpose thanks to high activity and physicochemical tunability.6 Beyond CO2RR, 
TMDCs have shown broad catalytic activity towards other reactions, such as oxygen reduction,7 
hydrodesulfurization,8,9 and hydrogen evolution (HER).10,11 Among TMDCs, MoS2 has the most 
established track record as a CO2RR electrocatalyst,12,13 thus serving a good model system to 
uncover fundamental underpinnings of function that may apply to TMDCs as a class of materials.

Description:
Binds to Mo at sulfur vacancies, affecting hybridization between S 3p and Mo 4d states.

Text:
Here, we follow the evolution of the electronic structure in MoS2 electrocatalysts during CO2RR 
using operando Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). We probed both the ligand and metal 
centers under functional CO2RR conditions and simulated the corresponding spectroscopic 
signatures using firstprinciples calculations. Thus, we report direct spectroscopic evidence of 
CO2 binding to Mo at sulfur vacancies, which perturbs the hybridization between S 3p and Mo 4d 
states. The spectroscopic signatures of the active state are consistent with the reduction of Mo, 
revealing its role in mediating charge transfer to CO2.

Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for conversion in electrocatalysis.

Text:
This study provides direct mechanistic 
evidence of the critical role of the generation and binding at sulfur vacancies for the reduction of 
CO2, pinpointing the importance of MoS hybridization in the design of electrocatalysts with high 
activity for the conversion of this greenhouse gas.
