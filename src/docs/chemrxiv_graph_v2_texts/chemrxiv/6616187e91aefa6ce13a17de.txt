Description:
An antiretroviral therapy that acts as a fusion inhibitor to prevent viral entry into cells.

Text:
The surface of the HIV virus contains a protein known as the envelope protein (Figure 1), 
which plays an important role for viral entry into the cells. This protein exists in two 
conformations open and closed. The envelope protein has two components known as gp120 and 
gp41. The gp120 protein contains a subprotein known as HT1 (shown in grey color in Figure 1), 
which binds to the CD4 receptor (shown in orange color in Figure 1) to gain entry into the cell.3 
If the interaction between the viral protein (HT1) and human cell receptor (CD4) can be prevented, 
viral entry can be inhibited. An example of a medication exhibiting this mechanism of action is 
enfuvirtide, which belongs to a new class of antiretroviral therapies known as fusion inhibitors.
