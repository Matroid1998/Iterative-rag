Description:
A polymer that increases a drug's hydrodynamic volume and reduces drug disposition by decreasing glomerular filtration.

PEGylation, the attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to a biologic, may improve various 
pharmaceutical aspects of the resulting bioconjugates, including stability, solubility, and 
pharmacokinetics 13. PEGylation increases a drugs hydrodynamic volume and may, at proper 
overall size, reduce drug disposition by decreasing glomerular filtration 4, 5. Another aspect of 
PEG known as stealtheffect, shields PEGylated biologics in part from phagocytic cells, thereby 
reducing elimination 1, 2. Both aspects contribute to longer halflives, and have been reported 
for PEGylated Interferon2a (IFN2a), which is the starting point of our study 6, 7. IFN2a, 
a cytokine with potent, antiviral, immunemodulating and antiproliferative properties, is used for 
hepatitis and cancer therapy since the 1980s 8. We selected IFN2a for its wealth of available 
information 621.
