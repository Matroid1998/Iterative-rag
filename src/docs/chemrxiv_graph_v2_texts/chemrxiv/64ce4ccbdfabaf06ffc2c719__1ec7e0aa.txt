of a weak bond into the polymer backbone. Among the various cyclic monomers that could be used 
in rROP, thionolactones are promising structures due to the efficiency of the CS bond to act as radical acceptor. Never
theless, only few structures were reported to be efficient. In this work, we used DFT calculations to gain better understand
ing of the radical reactivity of thionolactones and in particular we focused on the transfer rate constant ktr value and its 
ratio with the propagation rate constant kp of the vinyl monomer. The closer to 1, the better the statistical incorporation of 
the two comonomers into the backbone. With this approach, we identified and prepared the 7phenyloxepane2thione 
(POT) thionolactone.
