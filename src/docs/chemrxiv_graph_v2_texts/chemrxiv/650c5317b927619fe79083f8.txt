Description:
A group 13 metal involved in element-ligand cooperative chemistry with redox-active or non-innocent ligand frameworks.

Text:
The development of transitionmetal coordination complexes designed to undergo the 
metalligand cooperative (MLC) breaking of chemical bonds is an exciting and rich field of 
research.1,2 Of particular importance have been the development of systems for the splitting of 
polar HX (X  heteroatom) bonds, which serves as an important step to introducing these 
reagents into catalytic processes without formal metalbased oxidative addition. This breadth of 
success is in contrast to the elementligand cooperative (ELC) chemistry of the maingroup 
elements, which has been much less developed.3 We have been investigating the coordination 
chemistry of aluminum and other group 13 metal complexes supporting redoxactive andor non
innocent ligand frameworks,4,5 and specifically have an interest in understanding the role that the 
complexes play in ELC chemistry.

Description:
Involved in ELC chemistry with HX bonds.

Text:
There is precedent for ELC chemistry between aluminum and HX bonds (Scheme 1). The Berben group has shown that their bis(imino)pyridine aluminum hydride complex (PhI2P2
)AlH) undergoes ELC chemistry with select anilines6 and alcohols7 to form the (PhHI2P1)Al(X)H 
complexes, where X represents an alkoxo or amido ligand that is installed at the metal ion while 
the ligand is protonated. They have advanced this chemistry to develop catalytic systems for the 
dehydrocoupling of amines6, the dehydrogenation of formic acid8, and carbonyl transfer 
hydrogenation.9
