Description:
Forms excimers characterized by a broad, structureless fluorescence band at higher wavelengths.

Text:
In contrast, those formed by different chemical species are referred to as 
exciplexes.3 
Initial studies on excimers date back to the 1960s, when a large amount of experimental evidence 
and data (including binding energies, lifetimes, and kinetic constants) were extracted from both steady
state and timeresolved fluorescence measurements.48 Indeed, the hallmark of excimerexciplex 
formation is a broad, structureless fluorescence band that appears at higher wavelengths compared to 
the typical emission of the individual constituents this redshift, together with the absence of a
