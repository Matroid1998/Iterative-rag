Description:
Has a low reduction potential of 3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode.

Text:
Although convenient for small scale testing, this 
approach can equate to a negativetopositive electrode ratio (NP ratio) of over 50 
3,5, where a value closer to 1 would be desirable. Li metals low reduction potential 
(3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode) causes irreversible loss of active S
