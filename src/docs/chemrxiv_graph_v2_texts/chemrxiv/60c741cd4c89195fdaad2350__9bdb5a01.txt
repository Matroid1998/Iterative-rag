Description:
Organic compounds that can be separated using molecular crystals due to their ability to change structure in response to guest inclusion.

There are reasons, how
ever, to consider nonbonded crystalline molecular frame
works for certain applications for example, it has proved 
challenging to produce large, highquality single crystals 
for MOFs17 and COFs,1820 whereas highquality organic 
crystals are often more accessible.21 Further, molecular 
crystals can change their structure in response to guest in
clusion, and this has led to applications in porosity switch
ing7,8 and in the separation of organic hydrocarbons.2224 
 It remains difficult, however, to predict how a candidate 
molecule will crystallize and, hence, to design new func
tion in this regard, molecular crystals are at a disadvantage 
with respect to MOFs and COFs.
