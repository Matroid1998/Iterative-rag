The electrolysis of water (2H2O  2H2  O2) to produce hydrogen fuel is critical 
47 
for renewableenergy infrastructure1, 2. Even in optimized electrolyzers, the efficiency is 
48 
reduced by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 4OH  2H2O  4e 
49 
 O2 in alkaline media)3, 4. Among the many OER catalysts studied over decades, Fe is 
50 
broadly pivotal in promoting the catalytic activity in alkaline media57. In particular, Ni and 
51 
Co (oxy)hydroxides require Fe to achieve high activity, regardless of whether it is 
52 
introduced intentionally or incidentally8, 9. Sustaining the high activity of these Fe
53 
containing (oxy)hydroxides requires soluble Fe species in the electrolyte due to the 
54 
dynamic Fe exchange at the catalystelectrolyte interface1013.
