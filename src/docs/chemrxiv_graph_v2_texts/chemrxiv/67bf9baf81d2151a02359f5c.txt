Description:
A complex whose 59Co chemical shifts were corrected by an order of magnitude in recent studies.

Text:
This was then proven by measurements of field
dependent 59Co NMR shifts in diamagnetic CoIII complexes.11 Over the years, the effect was
theoretically treated by various authors1217 until a recent joint experimental and theoretical
study3 corrected the old values for the 59Co chemical shifts in the Co(acac)3 complex by an
order of magnitude, and finally reconciled measurements and theoretical predictions. 3
