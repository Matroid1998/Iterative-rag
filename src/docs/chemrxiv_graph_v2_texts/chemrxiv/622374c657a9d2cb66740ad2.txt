Description:
A functionality linking two main fused guanidinic portions.

Text:
Chemically, they 
feature two main fused guanidinic portions linking together via an ester functionality, 
where a principle tricyclic system named clathriadic acid is assembled to another 
clathriadic acid or a crambescin bicyclic moiety 26. Biogenetically, those marine 
alkaloids are supposed to be generated via sequential modes of cyclization between a 
polyketidederived chain and a putative guanidine precursor along with different 
oxidation degrees to afford such complex metabolites 25, 2729.
