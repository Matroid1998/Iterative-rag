Within
this diverse category, carbonbased materials such as activated
carbon fibres, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, graphene,
graphite, and graphene oxide have shown remarkable potential
due to their tunable structure and surface reactivity8. Water (H2O) adsorption on twodimensional (2D) materials,
such as graphene and fullerenebased sheets, plays a crucial
role in applications ranging from sensing to photocatalysis912. Pristine graphene and related 2D materials exhibit weak water
adsorption due to its nonpolar nature. In contrast, structural
modifications like doping with heteroatoms (e.g., B, N, or P)
significantly enhance its hydrophilicity and adsorption capac
ity1316. Similarly, fullerenebased 2D networks demonstrate
improved water interaction upon doping, altering surface charge
distribution and electronic properties1719.

Description:
Carbon-based material that can be functionalized to form distinct derivatives with tailored properties.

Text:
In this context, functionalized refers to
incorporating different chemical groups into the graphene struc
ture, forming distinct GO derivatives with tailored properties. Carbonbased materials, mainly GOmodified with metal oxides,
have also garnered significant research interest due to their
improved stability, durability, and enhanced electrocatalytic and
photocatalytic performance2831. These findings underscore
the importance of defect engineering and functionalization in
optimizing carbonbased materials to capture and activate small
molecules. Using computational modelling and experimental ad
vances, researchers can design nextgeneration materials capable
of addressing the challenges posed by climate change32,33. The
insights gained from these studies contribute to fundamental
scientific knowledge and pave the way for innovative solutions to
energy and environmental sustainability3436.
