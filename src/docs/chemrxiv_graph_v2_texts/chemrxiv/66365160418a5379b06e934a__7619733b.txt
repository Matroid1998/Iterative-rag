Description:
The central intracellular second messenger in signal transduction cascades, involved in controlling cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels and activating exchange proteins.

For instance, GPCRs are targeted by approximately 35 of 
prescription pharmaceuticals, emphasizing the relevance of their 
signal transduction cascades for pharmacology.5,6 For example, 
the activation of the adrenergic receptor by the hormone 
adrenaline on the extracellular side triggers a complex signal 
transduction mechanism involving several enzymes such as 
adenylyl cyclase (AC), protein kinase A (PKA), or the cyclic 
nucleotide adenosine 3,5cyclic monophosphate (cAMP).2 
cAMP is the central intracellular second messenger in this 
cascade, forwarding the incoming signal to further downstream 
effectors of the cell.7,8 Since cAMP is involved in controlling 
cyclic nucleotidegated ion channels,9 exchangeproteins 
activated by cAMP (EPAC),10 Popeye domaincontaining 
proteins,11 and the enzyme PKA, it is one of the most intensely 
studied second messengers.2 Among other functions, PKA 
controls metabolic pathways, such as the catabolism of 
glycogen or fatty acids.2 Acting as a connecting link between 
the extracellular stimulus perceived by the GPCR and further 
downstream effectors, cAMP not only forwards the incoming 
signal, but its biosynthesis in multiple copies also denotes an 
amplification step.
