Tetrahydrocyclopentabfuranols and their derivatives are a privileged 
fused heterocyclic skeletons frequently found in many natural products and 

biologically active molecules, such as heliconol AC,1 HIV1 
protease inhibitors,2 methyl rocaglate and rocaglamide,3 PRMT5 
inhibitors,4 silvestrol and episilvestrol,5 and so on6 (Figure 1). These 
compounds exhibit a broad spectrum of important biological activities, 
including antifungal, anticancer, antiinflammatory, antiHIV and serine 
hydrolase inhibitory activities. Figure

Despite the significance of tetrahydrocyclopentabfuranols, efficient 
method for the construction of these frameworks has been rarely developed. The domino reactions of oxo, unsaturated carbonyls provide a 
powerful strategy for the synthesis of cyclic compounds.
