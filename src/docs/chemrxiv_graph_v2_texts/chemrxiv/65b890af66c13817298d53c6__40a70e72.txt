Description:
Causes alveolar damage and delayed onset of pulmonary toxicity leading to death by pulmonary edema.

Text:
The available animal data 
was obtained mainly prior to 1950. Exposure to animals causes alveolar damage and a 
delayed onset of pulmonary toxicity leading to death by pulmonary edema.8 Similar to 
phosgene, the delayed effects result from the nonenzymatic acylation of lung proteins, as 
opposed to direct irritation. The Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGL)3 (lifethreatening 
levels) for ketene are 0.24 ppm for 10 min and 0.088 ppm for 8 h.8 
Vitamin E acetate (VEA) has been linked to the 20192020 ecigarette or vaping 
product useassociated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic, in large part due to VEAs prevalence 
in patient samples.9 In 2020, Wu and OShea reported the formation of ketene when heating 
and vaping VEA,7 indicating an additional possible link between ketene and EVALI.
