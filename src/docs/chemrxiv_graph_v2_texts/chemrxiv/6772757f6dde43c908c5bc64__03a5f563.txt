Description:
AgS clusters with an internal heavy-atom effect influencing optical properties.

Text:
Singlecrystal Xray diffraction (SCXRD) and proton nuclear 
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy revealed that the resulting Ag clusters were composed 
of XAg54S20(thiolate)20(sulfonate)m, where (X, m)  (S, 12) or (I, 11) (XAg54). Furthermore, a 
comparison of the optical properties of the obtained pair of XAg54 (X  S or I) demonstrated that 
an internal heavyatom effect occurred in these AgS clusters, similar to that in organic fluorescent 
dyes. Accordingly, the phosphorescence quantum yield was 16 times higher when S2 was replaced 
by I as the encapsulated atom (Scheme 1). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024qr74v ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000339651399 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
