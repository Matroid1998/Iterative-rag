Description:
Materials that may be difficult or impossible to synthesize due to formation energy constraints.

Text:
Zeolites are microporous solids that are often synthesized using organic
and inorganic structuredirecting agents (OSDAs and ISDAs, respectively). Over 200 unique zeolite frameworks have been synthesized 1, while over
300,000 more have been hypothesized as possible based on SiO4 tetrahedron
connectivity geometries and estimated formation energies 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. No
tably, these hypothetical frameworks are filtered based on having a formation
energy below 30 kJ (mol Si)1. More recent work has noted that pure sil
ica frameworks have formation energies well below this threshold (619 kJ
(mol Si)1) and that the range of formation energies of existing silica mate
rials changes with the density of the framework 7; as such, many of these
materials may be difficult or impossible to synthesize in (alumino)silicate
form.
