Description:
Acts as a terminal oxidant in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenols.

Photoredox chemistry, a catalytic approach to harvesting visible light energy, provides a way out of 
this conundrum.610 In pioneering work in 2011 it was shown that benzene oxidation can be carried out 
photocatalytically to produce phenols with oxygen as a terminal oxidant.11,12 Subsequently a new 
reactivity paradigm for selective oxidative functionalization of arenes under mild conditions was 
established.1322 However, such systems are confined to the energy of a single photon of visible light, 
e.g.
