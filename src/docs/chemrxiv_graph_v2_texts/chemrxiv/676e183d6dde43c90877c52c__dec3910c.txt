Description:
Constitutes part of the complex chemical environment in conjugated molecules.

Organic semiconductors (OSCs), composed of conjugated molecules, polymers, or combi
nations thereof offer distinctive tunability of their electrical and optical properties and have
garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in electronics, photonics, and
energy storage.17 Different from drug molecule design, the performance of OSCs can be
optimized not only in the molecule level like altering the length or aromatic character of the
conjugated pathways of the carbon framework,814 but also in the aggregation morphology
level.1518 For example, the molecular orientations are crucial to determine the outcoupling
efficiency of OLED,19 and preventing the  aggregation can also increase the electron
mobility of OPV.20
Over the past few decades, progress in computational approaches such as density func
tion theory (DFT)21,22 and molecular dynamics (MD)23 has enabled the investigation of the
electronic, redox, and optical properties at the molecule level2427 and detecting the solid
state ordering or evaluating transport properties at the aggregation morphology level for
OSCs.19,20,28,29 However, the bulk properties are only well studied through MD simulation in
systems whose force field parameters are supported by existing force fields.19,3032 As conju
gated molecules or polymers consist of multiple heterocyclic or benzene rings, their chemical
environment are significantly more complex than those of drug molecules or small organic
molecules.33 Consequently, the force filed parameters for parts of conjugated molecules can
not be matched with existing parameter libraries such as GAFF34 and CGenFF.35 Fur
thermore, owing to the distinctive electrondeficient nature, Boron atoms are commonly
