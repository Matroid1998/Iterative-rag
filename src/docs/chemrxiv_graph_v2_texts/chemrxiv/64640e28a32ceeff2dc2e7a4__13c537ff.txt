Description:
Acts as a reducing agent in various biomolecules.

Text:
The conjugates linker,
designed to be sensitive to thiolcysteine, reacts with the thiol groups of cysteine residues
present in various biomolecules, such as proteins or glutathione, which act as reducing
agents.This approach can take advantage of the thiol sensitivity of the conjugate, as well as
cysteines facile redox chemistry, which can enhance drug bioavailability and efficacy by
increasing stability and cell permeability.7 In this study, we investigate the role of
thiolsensitivity in modulating the bioavailability and efficacy of drug candidates using an
aspirincysteine conjugate with a thioester linkage. We synthesized the conjugate using a
thiolcleavable linker and evaluated its bioavailability and efficacy in vitro. Our results
demonstrate the potential of thioesterbased thiol switch approaches for drug development
and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying thiolcysteine sensitivity. 3.
