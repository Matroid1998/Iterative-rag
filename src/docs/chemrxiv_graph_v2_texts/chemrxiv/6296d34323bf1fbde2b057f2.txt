Description:
A subgroup of molecules used in photo and electroswitchable molecular devices.

for photo and electroswitchable molecular devices.12 Such molecules coordinated to paramagnetic 
centers enable the control of the magnetic properties of the resulting compound upon reversible 
photoisomerization reaction of the ligand.13, 14, 15, 16 The control occurs either through the modification of 
the magnetic interaction pathways  the two photoisomers need to transmit these interaction differently17 
or by influencing the coordination geometry of the paramagnetic species. Dithienylethenes18 (a subgroup
