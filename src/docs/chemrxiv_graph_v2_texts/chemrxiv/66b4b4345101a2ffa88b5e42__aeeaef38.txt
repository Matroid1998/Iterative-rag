Description:
A metal salt used in binary mixtures for deep eutectic electrolytes.

Text:
DEEs
are typically binary mixtures consisting of a metal salt, like
lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), and an or
ganic hydrogen bond donor, such as an amide1517. Synthesizing novel DEEs with desirable properties from a
large number of potential components remains a challenging
task, which demands a detailed understanding of the interac
tions among different components at the molecular scale and
the diffusion behavior of ionic species. Computer simulations
are effective and valuable tools in this regard, providing insights
into the nature of atomicscale interactions and ion transport
mechanisms in liquid electrolytes. There are several molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation studies of eutectic electrolytes, with
the majority of them based on classical force fields (FFs)13,1820
and manybody polarizable FF models2124.
