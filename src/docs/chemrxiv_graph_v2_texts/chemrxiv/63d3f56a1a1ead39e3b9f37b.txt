Description:
A polymer that can phase separate in water to form aqueous two-phase systems.

This was first observed when 
forming OW droplets stabilized by amphiphilic polymers that also contained salts, dispersed 
in oil, which contributed to the formation of small aqueous droplets within oil 17, 18, 2234. Another alternative method under study would be to produce double emulsions 
starting from waterinwater emulsions. These later are made of mixtures of for instance 2 
segregative polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Dextran (Dex) that phase separate 
at a given concentration in water 3541. Depending on the concentration and the molecular 
weight of both polymers, one can form Dexrich droplets in a continuous PEGrich 
continuous phase. Such systems are also known as aqueous twophase systems (ATPS).
