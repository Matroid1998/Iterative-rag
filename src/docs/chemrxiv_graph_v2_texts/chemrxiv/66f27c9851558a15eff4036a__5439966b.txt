Description:
Alloys consisting of five or more principal elements in near equiatomic proportions, forming simple solid solutions due to high mixing entropy.

High entropy alloys (HEAs) are alloys that consist of five or more principal elements in near
equiatomic proportions (1,2) that tend to form simple solid solutions during solidification, 
instead of intermetallic compounds, owing to high mixing entropy (3). HEAs have been 
identified as promising candidates for various heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis 
applications (49). For instance, Qiu et al. developed a nanoporous AlNiCuPtPdAu materials 
for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), important for metalair batteries and fuel cells. The 
resulting catalyst exhibits greatly enhanced high temperature stability and have display redox 
activity up to ten times higher than the characteristics of PtC catalysts (10). For the CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR), superior durable catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 was 
demonstrated using CoNiCuRuPd HEA nanoparticles (11).
