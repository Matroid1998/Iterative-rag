Description:
Synthetic polymers known for their high physical properties, biocompatibility, and blood compatibility.

Therefore, it is extremely needed 
15 
to understand the mechanism of adsorption of proteins to minimize the formation of the clots. In an effort to design 
16 
and synthesis of blood compatible polymeric materials, many researchers have tried to increase the hydrophilicity of 
17 
the surfaces to reduce the formation of clots (since proteins adsorb on hydrophobic surfaces more than hydrophilic) 
18 
2, 15. Among the synthetic polymer for biomedical applications, polyurethanes (PU) have got considerably 
19 
significant attention due to their high physical properties, biocompatibility and blood compatibility 5, 8, 10. 20 
Polyurethanes can be synthesize from the polyaddition reaction between diisocyanate (hard segment) and polyol 
21 
groups (soft segment) 10, 1922.
