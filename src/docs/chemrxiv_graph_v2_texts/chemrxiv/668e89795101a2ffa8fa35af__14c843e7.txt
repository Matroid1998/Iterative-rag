Description:
Heterocycles with inherent reactivity, often functionalized at the C2 and C4 positions.

Text:
Heterocyclic scaffolds are present in numerous natural products, 
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and have found their place in 
material science. 1 , 2 , 3 Among them, the pyridine moiety is, 
according to the US Food and Drug Administration, one of the 
most common motif in approved drugs (Scheme 1A). 4 , 5 As 
biological activity can be finetuned by the substitution pattern at 
this core, methodologies for pyridine functionalizations are highly 
sought. Numerous strategies for the peripheral editing of pyridines 
have been developed but, due to their inherent reactivity 
functionalizations at the C2 and C4 positions of the heterocycle 
prevail,6,7,8,9 with chemical modification at the C3 position still 
presenting a significant challenge.

Description:
Undergo selective C3 amination in a photocatalytic manner.

Text:
37 , 38 , 39 , 40 Based on reports 
concerning the functionalization of Zincke imines,41,42,43,44,45 and 
our studies on photochemical amination of dienol ethers, we 
hypothesized that selective C3amination of pyridines could be 
achieved in a photocatalytic manner. Indeed, we demonstrate 
that Ncentered radicals, generated from Naminopyridinum 
salts in a photochemical manner, react with Zincke imine to 
regioselectively produce, after rearomatization, C3amino 
pyridines.
