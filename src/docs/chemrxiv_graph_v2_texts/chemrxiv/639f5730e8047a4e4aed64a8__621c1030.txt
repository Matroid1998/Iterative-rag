Description:
Exhibits remarkable properties in its planar configuration and can have its electronic structure modified by straining.

Text:
The use of curved supports for inducing local strain is well established for generating exotic 
properties from conventional layered materials1. An excellent example is graphene, which already 
exhibits remarkable properties in its planar configuration. Straining graphene can modify its 
electronic structure to create polarized carrier puddles, induce pseudomagnetic fields, and alter 
surface properties2. In MoS2, modifying the supporting glass sphere diameter induces curvature in 
the MoS2, which permits precise bandgap tuning of MoS2 in a continuous range as large as 360 
meV3. Curved MoS2 conformally coated on Au nanocone arrays is a promising catalyst for the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The improved HER activity is attributed to sulfurvacancies 
and reduction of the bandgap under strain4.

Description:
A material suitable for strain engineering due to its relatively large size.

Text:
Graphene and MoS2 are good candidates for strain 
engineering because they are relatively large (mm) in size. However, strain induction for sub2 
nm materials is challenging due to the mismatch of lateral size with supports and difficulties in 
material transfer. Molecular complexes such as metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are efficient CO2 
reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts because of their electronic structures and the tunable ligand 
environments surrounding the active sites5. However, these molecules along with most other 
molecular catalysts primarily reduce CO2 to CO; catalysts that selectively reduce CO2 beyond CO 
are scarcely reported6,7. An early study of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) in 19848 showed a 
methanol (MeOH) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 5.
