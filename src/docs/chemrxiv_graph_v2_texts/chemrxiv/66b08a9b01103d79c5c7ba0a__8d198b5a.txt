Eunicellane diterpenoids, characterized 
51 
by their unique 6,10bicyclic skeleton, include more than 400 compounds8, such as the 
52 
potent anticancer agent eleutherobin. Similarly, biflorane diterpenoids, known for their 
53 
6,6bicyclic structure and a prenyl tail, comprise over 290 identified compounds10. 54 
These terpenoids are renowned for their diverse biological activities; for example, 
55 
pseudopterosin A from corals exhibits antiinflammatory and analgesic effects11, while 
56 
kalihinol A from sponges is noted for its antimalarial properties12. 57 
Nevertheless, the content of terpenoids in marine invertebrates is typically low, 
58 
presenting a significant challenge for downstream drug development. To address this, 
59 
chemical scientists have diligently explored synthetic routes to overcome this limitation, 
60 
albeit with unsatisfactory yields13,14.
