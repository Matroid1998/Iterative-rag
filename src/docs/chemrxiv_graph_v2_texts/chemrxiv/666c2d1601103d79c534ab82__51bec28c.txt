Used in lithium-ion batteries for energy storage.

Lithiumion batteries are an inevitable part of energy storage in our modern world. However, 
conventional lithiumion batteries are expected to run into performance limits.1 To push battery 
performance beyond these limitations, it is critical to investigate alternative battery 
technologies. One particularly promising technology is solidstate batteries (SSB). By replacing 
separators and liquid electrolytes of lithiumion batteries with solidstate ion conductors, the 
usage of Limetal anodes and thus higher energy densities can potentially be enabled.24 
Further advantages are increased mechanical stability, the absence of leakage and a 
potentially improved thermal safety.5 
Solidstate batteries utilize composite electrodes, consisting of the electrochemically active 
material, the solid electrolyte (SE) and, if necessary, additives such as binders or conductive 
carbons, e.g., vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF).
