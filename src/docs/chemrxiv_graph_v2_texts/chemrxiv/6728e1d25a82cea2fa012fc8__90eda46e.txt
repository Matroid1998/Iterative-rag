Despite the historic success of vitamin D fortification programs to prevent nutritional rickets in 
childhood 1, 2, subclinical vitamin D deficiency (VDD) remains a global health concern given 
its important skeletal and extraskeletal functions, including immunomodulation and inflammation 
regulation 3. The primary source of vitamin D is vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) derived from 7
dehydrocholesterol in the skin following its photoconversion by UVB solar radiation 4. Genetic 
polymorphisms and certain dietary sources (e.g., oily fish, fortified milk, supplements) also 
contribute to overall vitamin D status 5 that is modified by latitude, skin pigmentation, age and 
various lifestyle and cultural factors that influence sun exposure 6, 7.
