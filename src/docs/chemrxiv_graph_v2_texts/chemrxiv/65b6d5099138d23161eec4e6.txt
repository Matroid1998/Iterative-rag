Description:
A drug used for the treatment of Chagas disease.

Text:
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a devastating infectious disease 
that is estimated to affect 67 Mio individuals globally and that is responsible for ca. 12 000 deaths 
every year.1 Chagas is a protozoal disease that is caused by the trypanosomatid Trypanosoma 
cruzi, which is mostly transmitted by bloodsucking triatomine insects, although other routes of 
transmission are also possible.2,3 Only two old drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are currently 
available for the treatment of Chagas disease;1,4 while these drugs can be curative when 
administered shortly after the infection, their efficacy diminishes at later stages of the disease. In addition, both drugs are associated with significant side effects, especially in older patients.
