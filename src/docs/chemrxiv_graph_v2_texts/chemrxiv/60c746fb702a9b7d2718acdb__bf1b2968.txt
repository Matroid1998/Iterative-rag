Description:
Small cyclic ketones used in myriad transformations.

Text:
The rearrangement of strained ketone derivatives, typically yielding 
ringexpanded or ringopened products, constitutes a key strategy 
for the elaboration of complex molecules relevant to the pharma
ceutical industry.1 While myriad transformations have been devel
oped with small cyclic ketones such as cyclobutanones,2 the analo
gous use of cyclopropanone derivatives as substrates has seriously 
lagged behind due to the kinetic instability often associated with 
these compounds, as a result of their extreme strain and multiple 
decomposition pathways. Indeed, while cyclopropane and cyclobu
tane derivatives generally possess similar strain energies, the corre
sponding cycloalkanones differ in this regard by ca.
