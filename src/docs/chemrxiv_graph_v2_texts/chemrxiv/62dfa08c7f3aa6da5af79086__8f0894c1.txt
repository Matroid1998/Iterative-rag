Description:
Serves as a substrate for GaAs(100) in photovoltaic applications.

Text:
GaInP, for example, has an ideal bandgap engineering potential and is commonly grown as a 
top photoabsorber in record photovoltaic layer structures1 with either latticematched 
stoichiometry (Ga0.51In0.49P) to GaAs(100) on Ge(100) substrates,7 or to an underlying GaInAs 
bottom solar cell.2 
But even more than the intrinsic properties of the individual layers, their interfaces might 
govern the overall properties of the device.8,9 Therefore, investigating the properties of such 
buried interfaces, such as band alignment and space charge layers induced by defect formation 
or chemical modifications, is crucial for addressing the efficiency losses of these devices.
