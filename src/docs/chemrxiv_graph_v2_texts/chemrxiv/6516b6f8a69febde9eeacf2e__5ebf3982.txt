Description:
Faces challenges in solid-state batteries due to interfacial contact loss and electrochemical stability limitations.

Text:
However, there 
are significant challenges associated with the energy density, rate capability, and capacity 
retention of solidstate batteries employing LPSCl4. These challenges arise from the 
interfacial contactloss during electrochemical cycling as a consequence of volumetric 
changes in electrodes and the electrochemical stability limitations in the preferred 
operation voltage range causing undesirable side reactions with highvoltage Nirich 
cathodes, giving rise to fast capacity fade, thus impeding their ultimate commercial 
realization 5. To mitigate the challenges associated with interfacial degradation caused by 
detrimental secondary reactions, the application of a protective coating on the surface of 
cathode particles is regarded as a productive mitigation strategy6.Considerable amount of 
research has been performed to explore suitable coating materials, such as oxides, e.g., 
ZrO27, HfO28, Li2ZrO39 and, LiNbO310, and phosphates, e.g., Li3PO411, and 
LiZr2(PO4)312.
