Description:
Radical anions predicted to be present in K3C6O6 with potential for rare band superconductivity.

Text:
In this computational study, we address materials composed 
formally of K and CO, and focus especially on K3C6O6, a material 
we predict to feature oxocarbon radical anions, extreme metal
licity and the potential for rare band superconductivity. Our 
study is in part motivated by the possibility of producing me
tallic organic salts, i.e., compounds where ionic and covalent 
bonding situations are mixed in a metallic solidstate struc
ture.1 Such compounds can exhibit a range of properties 
needed in, for example, spintronics, superconductors, optoe
lectronic devices, and electrochemical sensors.24 
CO is a common ligand useful for probing electronic structure 
in part due to its ability to engage in backdonation. However, 
CO can also react with itself. The thermodynamic ground state 
of CO in the condensed phase is experimentally uncertain.

Description:
Compounds stabilized by extensive conjugation and formed by reducing CO with various elements.

Around the same time, Liebig16 circulating CO 
through molten potassium and made what was much later 
identified as a mixture of potassium ethynediolate and potas
sium benzenehexolate. Since then, a variety of s , p, d and f
block elements have been used to reduce CO, yielding different 
oxocarbon compounds (see e.g., ref 9 and references therein). Some oxocarbon compounds are stabilized by extensive con
jugation,1719 and anions tend to adopt cyclic structures with all 
carbon atoms bonded to a carbonyl or an enolic oxygen atom.
