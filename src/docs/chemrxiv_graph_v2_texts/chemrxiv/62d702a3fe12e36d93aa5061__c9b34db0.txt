The modern chemical industry stands at a crossroads. Following decades of fastpaced growth, 
chemicals and their derivatives are now ubiquitous in society (1, 2) and essential for supporting 
modern lifestyles, contributing over 7 of global domestic product (GDP) in 2017 (3). Moreover, in the future, chemicals will likely play a significant role in delivering netzero targets 
(e.g., ammonia for shipping). However, the industry faces multiple planetwide environmental 
dilemmas. Energyintensive chemical production processes consumed 14 of global oil and 9 
of global gas, and released 13 of global industrial direct CO2 emissions in 2020 (4, 5).
