Hydrogen is often advertised as a green and clean fuel of the future, but it already is an important chemical
feedstock. Worldwide, 96 of hydrogen is used in the chemical industry, mostly in production of ammonia
fertilisers and hydrocarbon refining.1 However, despite its status as the most abundant substance in the universe,
it is very scarce in its most useful H2 diatomic form on Earth, where it exists primarily in water, hydrocarbons
and other organic matter.2,3 Hydrocarbons have been traditionally used in production of hydrogen, with coal
gasification and steam methane reforming among the most popular methods. Both are highly energyintensive
