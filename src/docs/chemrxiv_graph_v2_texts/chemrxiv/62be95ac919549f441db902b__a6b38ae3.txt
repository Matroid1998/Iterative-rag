Description:
A super hard material with a hardness of about 35 GPa, used in abrasive and plate armour applications.

Text:
Due to its high hardness of about 35 GPa 1, rhombohedral boron carbide , commonly denoted B4C or 
B13C2, here referred to as rBxC (4  x 10.5), is mainly used as a super hard material in applications 
such as abrasive or plate armour.2 Additionally, owing to the selfhealing capabilities of the boron 
icosahedra under energetic bombardment3 and due to the high neutron crosssection of the isotope 
10B, it is a promising material for boronbased neutron detectors.4 Interestingly, and less explored, is 
that rBxC is a semiconductor with electronic properties which can be tuned with the BC 
stoichiometry.57 Its bandgap, for instance, ranges from 0.48 to 2.1 eV with increasing boron content.5
7 Semiconducting rBxC could be used in combination with the wide bandgap materials boron 
subphosphide (B12P2)8 and boron subarsenide (B12As2)9, with which it shares structural similarities, and 
would enable the fabrication of novel radiation resistant heterostructures.
