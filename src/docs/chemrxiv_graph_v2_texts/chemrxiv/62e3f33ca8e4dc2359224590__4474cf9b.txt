However, the 
antibacterial activities of Cr3 with , to the best of our knowledge, have not been reported yet. Previously, we had studied the preparation and antimicrobial activity of nicotine and its Zn2 complex. However, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was the basis for the evaluation of the antibacterial

pathogenic gramnegative and grampositive bacteria.
