Description:
Produced from methane through processes like Steam Methane Reforming.

Earth is home to rich reserves of methane, making it an attractive feedstock and a foremost
competitor for the production of green fuel. 1 The myriad occurrence of methane can be
attributed to its stable nature. Higher symmetry (Td) along with close shell electronic con
 guration, wide HOMOLUMO gap (8.9 eV), and four stable CH bonds (Ebd 4.5 eV),
makes it thermodynamically and kinetically stable at room temperature. Given the signi 
cant mass percentage of hydrogen (25.13) in methane, it is widely used for hydrogen pro
duction.2 Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and FischerTropsch (FT) synthesis are widely
used processes for conversion of methane to hydrogen as well as to valueadded products like
methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, higher hydrocarbons, and FT fuels.

Description:
A product of complete dehydrogenation of methane by nickel catalysts.

Text:
However, stability
of methane makes it resistant to electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. For most methane
conversion reactions, the rst CH bond cleavage is the primary and the ratelimiting step. This motivates the rational design of a catalyst aiming at reducing the activation barrier for
CH bond dissociation. Planar and stepped nickel surfaces are goto catalysts used industrially in the aforemen
tioned processes, primarily because Ni is procured at cheap rates and portrays excellent
reactivity towards methane. The drawback of Ni catalysts is that they can completely dehy
drogenate methane into carbon and hydrogen, which causes coking. Nullifying or preventing
coking in methane conversion reactions is challenging area of current research.
