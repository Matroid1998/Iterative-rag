Description:
2D materials with electronic and photophysical properties of interest for various applications.

Another option is NIR fluorescent nanomaterials, such as semiconducting 
singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)711, quantum dots12, or doped nanoparticles13. Twodimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide electronic and photophysical properties that are 
of interest for a broad range of applications and technologies, for example in photonics, 
electronics, catalysis, and particularly in biomedical applications1416. The most prominent 
representative of this class is graphene17,18, among other 2D materials such as transition metal 
dichalcogenides (TMDs)19,20 or silicate clays21. Two routes are available for generating 2D 
nanomaterials. On the one hand, there are bottomup synthesis processes for 2D materials, such 
as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), epitaxial growth or wet chemical processes22,23. These 
can be used to produce thin, largearea and uniform layers, but only in small quantities and at 
high cost.
