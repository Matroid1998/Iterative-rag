Description:
A positive electrode material used in lithium-ion batteries.

High performance electrochemical energy stor
age is a key component of the renewable en
ergy transition. Liion batteries represent an in
creasingly important contribution across a wide
range of energy applications. However, Liion
electrochemistry is almost entirely dominated
by a small handful of active materials. On
the positive electrode, these include LiCoO2,
LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 spinel, and their isostruc
tural analogues. Nevertheless, this meager se
lection of crystal structures has generated an
