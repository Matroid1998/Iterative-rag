Description:
A system that can result in a uranyl oxosalt phase under physical pressure.

11 have also shown that applying physical pressure on the uranylsulfate
system can result in a uranyl oxosalt phase holding a considerably bent uranyl. In 2018,
Hayton has catalogued the uranyl complexes that feature a Oyl UOyl angle smaller than
172,2 to which we must add the works by Car 12 and Carter et al. 13. In this work, the focus is on the impact of bending on the uranyl electronic structure. Indeed the ligand induced weakening of uranyl internal bond is expected to impact in the
