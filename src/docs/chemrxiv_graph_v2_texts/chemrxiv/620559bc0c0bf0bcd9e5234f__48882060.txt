Description:
Magnesium-ion batteries offer a higher volumetric capacity due to the bivalency of magnesium, with a low electrochemical potential (2.37 V vs. SHE) and are environmentally friendly.

The most 
prominent representatives are Lithiumion batteries (LIBs)15, which are facing controversy 
due to the use of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, or graphite.6 Metallic 
lithium anodes have a high theoretical capacity (3861 mAhg1), the lowest negative 
electrochemical potential (3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)), and a low density 
(0.59 gcm3), however, are prone to form dendrites.7 Dendrites are needleshaped structures 
leading to short circuits, thermal runaways, and even battery failures, although promising 
approaches such as the electrostatic shielding of the lithium surface through additives have 
been proposed to tackle this problem.8 Due to these safety concerns, graphite with 
intercalated lithium ions is still used as anode material in commercial LIBs, reducing its 
theoretical capacity by roughly one order of magnitude to 372 mAhg1 in present day 
commercial LIBs.9 
Therefore, rechargeable multivalent magnesiumion batteries (MIBs) have emerged as a 
promising alternative, mainly due to the bivalency of the magnesium atom, which allows it to 
carry twice the charge resulting in a higher volumetric capacity (3833 mAhcm3 vs. 777 
mAhcm3 of graphite anodes in commercial LIBs).10 Additionally, magnesium has a low 
electrochemical potential (2.37 V vs. SHE), is highly abundant, of low cost, and is 
environmentally friendly.

Description:
Used in rechargeable magnesium-ion batteries, but challenges include finding suitable electrolytes for reversible deposition.

Text:
These benefits are reflected in the exponentially increasing number 
of publications that have recently been dedicated to the topic of MIBs, as shown in Figure 1 
from the publication by Li et al.11 On the other hand, a great deal of effort is required to find 
suitable electrolytes that allow reversible magnesium deposition while at the same time 
providing a broad electrochemical window.9,12 Conventional carbonate electrolytes cannot be 
used for rechargeable MIBs because the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed by 
decomposition products of the electrolyte is not permeable to magnesium, in contrast to 
lithiumcations.10,13 Proposed solutions are electrolytes based on Grignard reagents, 
Mg(TFSI)2 salts or ionic liquids, as well as the use of polymeric interlayers as artificial SEI.13,14 
Nevertheless, the structure and growth mechanism of SEI formation remains poorly 
understood due to its high complexity, highlighting the need for adequate theoretical modeling 
on different time and length scales.15 
The second controversial issue is whether dendrite formation is possible on metallic 
magnesium anodes.
