Description:
Involved in direct inner sphere coordination with metal ions at the O6 carbonyl position of guanine bases.

As 
such, structural insight into G4s and G4ligand complexes is useful to assist in ligand design. G4s consist of planar Gquartets, formed by four guanine bases hydrogenbonded in 
a Hoogsteen motif (Figure 1a), and these quartets can stack vertically to produce the full G4 
structure. This stacking requires the presence of metal ions to stabilise the structure. Overall, 
G4s are therefore stabilised by the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form quartets of bases 
and  stacking interactions between Gquartets to form the G4 structure. There are also 
specific metal ion interactions (direct inner spheres coordination) with the O6 carbonyl oxygen 
of the guanine bases as well as nonspecific electrostatic ionic interactions. However, the
