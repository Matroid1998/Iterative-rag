Description:
A toxic and carcinogenic metalloid that enters the environment through natural processes and anthropogenic input.

Text:
Antimony (Sb) is a toxic and carcinogenic metalloid that enters the environment through 
both natural processes (weathering, volcanic eruptions) and anthropogenic input. Anthropogenic 
input includes mining and processing of antimonycontaining ores and the production of antimony 
metal.1 Sulfide minerals such as stibnite are commonly mined for Sb extraction, and the tailings 
left behind from this process are vulnerable to leaching.2 Monitoring of Sb contamination in the 
natural waterways and drinking water will be essential to maintain clean water during mining 
operations.
