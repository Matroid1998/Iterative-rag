Description:
A compound where V and O can be replaced by Ga and F to engineer nonlinear optical properties.

Text:
Another technique is to charge balance 
aliovalent substitution on the anion sublattice by simultaneous aliovalent substitution on the 
cation sublattice or of a different anion. For example, Zn2FN can be synthesized as an 
analogue to ZnO to tune the band gap and photocatalytic properties13, V and O can be 
simultaneous replaced in PbVO2(SeO3)2Cl and Ba2VO2F2(IO3)2(IO3) by Ga and F to 
synthesize PbGaF2(SeO3)Cl14 and Ba2GaF4(IO3)2(IO3)15 to engineer the nonlinear optical 
properties. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024rrpfv ORCID httpsorcid.org000000017020199X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
