Description:
Beneficial as an alternative source of energy due to good electrochemical activity, availability, and biodegradability.

It consists of two halfreactions, 
anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). OER involves sluggish kinetics4, which takes place at a theoretical potential of 1.23 V under 
standard conditions. OER has a high activation energy barrier for OO bond formation that is a 
significant bottleneck in the efficiency of many energies storage technologies5, like 
rechargeable metalair batteries and hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting 
reaction. The problem of efficiency of the water splitting reaction can be solved by tuning anodic water 
oxidation with the simultaneous oxidation of other more readily oxidizable species like 
alcohol6,7. Owing to the good electrochemical activity, availability, and biodegradability of 
CH3OH and C2H5OH, both are beneficial as an alternative source of energy8.
