Description:
Can be identified using 19F NMR due to its wide range of chemical shifts.

Text:
It can screen and deconvolute large mixtures of compounds due to the 
wide range of 19F NMR chemical shift, can identify reporterspy molecules that can then be used to 
screen molecules not containing fluorine, and measure the binding affinity of the identified hits.4 The 
possibility of screening large mixtures makes 19F NMR a highthroughput method. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023sd3vqv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000349886183 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
