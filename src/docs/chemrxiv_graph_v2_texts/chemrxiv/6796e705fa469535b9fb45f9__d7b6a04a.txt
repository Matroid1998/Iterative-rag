Description:
Hydrazones are used in coupling reactions with terminal alkynes.

Text:
In this 
field, coppercatalyzed asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted allenes (or alkynes) has been 
achieved in the coupling of diazoalkanes (or hydrazones) with terminal alkynes where the 
protonation process closures the reaction (Scheme 1a, top).4 Besides, terminal alkynes 
and silylboronic esters as nucleophiles are envisaged to terminate the catalytic cycle, thus 
two carboncarbon bonds can be constructed in an enantioselective threecomponent 
reaction manner (Scheme 1a, bottom).5 In addition, the aforementioned stereoenriched 
metal species also demonstrated its utility in the assembly of axial and inherent chirality 
whether through a H or heteroatom elimination pathway.

Description:
React with aryl bromides to synthesize axially chiral vinyl arenes.

Text:
Synthesis of axially chiral 
vinyl arenes in the reactions of hydrazones and aryl bromides was pioneered in 2016, in 
which the tetrahydronaphthalene moieties could guarantee the essential H elimination 
and emergence of diaryl phosphine oxide substituted atropisomers (Scheme 1b, top).6 In 
a comparable method, an elegant work in the assembly of axially chiral cyclohexylidenes 
was reported via a OH elimination process in the aryl coupling reactions whereas for 
diazo substrates restricted to the cis conformation (Scheme 1b, middle).7 As a comparison, 
benzyl bromides were tolerated in the carbene coupling reactions as well in which still the 
process of H elimination facilitated the formation of inherently chiral sevenmembered 
rings (Scheme 1b, bottom).8 
Enantioenriched cyclobutanes are considered as valuable moieties in biologically 
active molecules and chemical synthesis.9 Owing to the inherent rigid structure and strain
release driven ring decomposing interference, the synthesis of such susceptible molecules
