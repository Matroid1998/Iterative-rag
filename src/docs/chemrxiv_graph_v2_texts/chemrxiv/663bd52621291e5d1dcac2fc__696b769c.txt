Description:
Reduced in strategies to enantioselectively construct 2substituted aminoethanols.

Text:
As 
building blocks for organic synthesis, 2substituted aminoethanols are a versatile input for chiral 
auxiliaries and catalysts.1 In medicinal chemistry they also serve as vital precursors for 
constructing chiral morpholines and piperazines.2,3 Numerous strategies to enantioselectively 
construct this unit have been reported over the years such as addition of nucleophilic carbon 
fragments into Garners aldehyde, reduction of amino acids, asymmetric reductive amination and 
Sharpless asymmetric aminohydroxylation, all of which are accessed by polar bond analysis (2e 
disconnections, Figure 1B).4,5 Although these approaches are valuable, a heavy reliance on harsh 
reactants such as organolithiummagnesium and LiAlH4 or toxic metals (Os) limits their 
widespread use. By far, the most widely adopted approach employs nucleophilic addition of 
organometallic reagents to chiral imines (Davis, Ellman, etc.
