Description:
Fabricated from corresponding MAX phases with the chemical composition of Mn1AXn.

Text:
Hence, the literature generally refers to 
the unit cell of Mn1XnT0 as pseudoP63mmc.14 

MXenes are fabricated from corresponding MAX phases with the chemical composition of Mn1AXn, where 
A is either group 3 or 4 elements (e.g., Al, Ga, Si) laying between the MXene layers.1518 MXenes have very 
diverse chemical compositions due to the different combinations of M, A, and X elements.

Description:
A family of compounds synthesized with more than 50 known variants.

Text:
To date, more than 
50 MXenes have been reported to be successfully synthesised.12 The family of MXenes is further expanded 
when two transition metals are mixed in a MXene structure, in which the transition metal may either be 
arranged randomly across all the M layers, or they may form ordered structures.1921 Given that the ratio of M 
and X in these double transition metal MAX precursors can be controlled as needed, the number of possible 
MXenes can be limitless.
