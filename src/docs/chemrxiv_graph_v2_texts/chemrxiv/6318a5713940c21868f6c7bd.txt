Description:
An important material that exhibits faradaic and nonfaradaic properties, which depend on particle size and manufacturing process.

The last two approaches effected different bulk properties for the same bulk material.7 Therefore the cycling behavior and 
rate capability in batteries are commonly tested to correlate changes of surface and particle size with changes in the performance.8 
It is well accepted that surface processes play a crucial role for the properties and performance of batteries and capacitors, yet there 
are still large gaps in our understanding of the relevant mechanisms.4 TiO2, for example, is an important, much studied material9 that 
exhibits faradaic and nonfaradaic properties, which both depend on particle size and manufacturing process10. There seems to be a 
dynamic dependence between the observed bulk characteristics of active materials and the nature of their surface.11 Surface 
modification dependent changes in a bulk material are difficult to observe.
