Description:
A molecule that interacts with concave-convex structures in molecular machines.

Text:
It therefore took ten years after their first report for proto
typical CPPs to be integrated into MIMs via the concave
convex  interactions with a fullerene (Figure 1a).41, 42 
Heteroatomcontaining CPPs have been used to construct 
MIMs based on efficient metal template and active metal
