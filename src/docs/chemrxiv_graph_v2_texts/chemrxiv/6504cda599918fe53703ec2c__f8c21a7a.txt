Description:
Amides are compatible functional groups for halogenation.

Text:
. Anomeric amide reagents can give those in 
a drug discovery program optionality enabling chlorination of endstage 
products. In the specific case of rivaroxaban (34), reagent 6 is uniquely 
successful for this latestage chlorination relative to Palauchlor. Halogenation using 67 can be easily performed on gramscale in batch, 
with 13 such examples shown in Table 2. Sulfonamides, amides, amines, 
tertiary alcohols, CF3alcohols, 1,2aminoalcohols, acetals, and cyclo
propanes are all compatible functional groups. The current limitations 
of this method are not surprising with alkene, alkyne and sulfoxidecon
taining substrates being incompatible. Arenes which are too electron
deficient are recalcitrant to halogenation (see SI for examples of this).
