Description:
A state-of-the-art thermoelectric material.

Text:
Among them, Zintl phase pnictides, which 
consist of covalently bonded anionic frameworks and cations, have 
been studied extensively because of their fascinating 
compositionalstructural varieties and promising thermoelectric 
properties.57 For example, AB2X2, A14BX11, A3BX3, A5B2X6, A9B4X9, 
and A2BX2where A denotes an alkalialkalineearthrareearth 
metal, B is a (post) transition metal, and X is a pnictogenhave 
been demonstrated as promising thermoelectric materials,815 
owing to the complex crystal structure that can lead to intrinsically 
lattice thermal conductivity, while the presence of covalent bonding 
maintains moderately high carrier mobility. Such characteristics 
offer promise for efficient thermoelectrics as well as other stateof
the arts thermoelectric materials, including GeTe,16,17 SnSe,18 
SnTe,19 flexible materials,20 oxides,21 etc.
