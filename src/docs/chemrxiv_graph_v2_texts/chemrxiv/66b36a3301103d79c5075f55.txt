Description:
Coordinated in a Ru(I) complex.

Text:
While Peters and others succeeded in isolating trigonal bi
pyramidal 17valencee Ru(I) complexes,9a, c, e Grtzmacher re
ported a unique 15valencee Ru(I) complex in a square planar co
ordination environment.9d The latter 15valencee Ru(I) complex 
(D) comprises two coordinated olefins and two mutually cisposi
tioned phosphines, while an  6arene interaction (between the metal 
and one of the arenes in tropPPh2, see Figure 1) was found in the 
corresponding Ru(II) counterpart (C).9d Given that these stereo
chemical peculiarities interfere with an unambiguous comparison of 
C and D, our strategy to employ a rigid tridentate scaffold (such as 
1P) for the synthesis of mutually comparable Ru(I), Ru(II) and
