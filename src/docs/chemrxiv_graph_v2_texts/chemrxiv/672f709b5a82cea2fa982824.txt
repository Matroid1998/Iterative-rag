Description:
A group decorating the surface of virtually all membranes with a TMA motif.

Text:
Depending on the degree of methylation, the mono, di, and trimethylated lysine struc
tures are formed with different biochemical and functional consequences.16,17 The positively
charged trimethylated lysine presents the same motif RN(CH3)
3 as the choline headgroup,
and these methylation patterns modulate the interactions between histone proteins and DNA
and constitute the core mechanisms of epigenetics.1823
Given the ubiquity of the TMA motifespecially with choline groups decorating the
surface of virtually all membranesit is important to understand the molecular details
