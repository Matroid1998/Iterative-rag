Description:
Known for reactivity towards boronic derivatives, particularly in Suzukitype CC coupling reactions.

Text:
The high importance of fluorinated compounds in 
medicinal chemistry and beyond implies a constant 
need for novel Fluorinecontaining chemotypes and 
synthesis thereof.3238 In this area, bromodifluoroacetic 
acid and its derivatives have been known for a long 
time as a valuable CF2 unit source applicable to a 
variety of transformations.3942 To date, the known 
reactivity of bromodifluoroacetate 1 towards boronic 
derivatives has been mostly described for aromatic 
substrates and included Suzukitype CC coupling 
reactions.4347 On the contrary, alkenyl boronates 2 
have been known to react with compound 1 via the 
ATRA pathway providing haloboronates of type 3 
(Scheme 2, A).9,48,49 In this work, we for the first time 
demonstrate an alternative reactivity profile for 
substrates 1 and 2 resulting in ipsosubstitution of the 
boroncontaining moiety (Scheme 2, B).
