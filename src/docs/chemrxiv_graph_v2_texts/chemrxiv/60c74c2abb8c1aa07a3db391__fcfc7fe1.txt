Description:
A liquid electrolyte used in lithium ion batteries with safety, thermal, and toxicity concerns.

Text:
Stateoftheart lithium ion batteries (LIBs) dominate the energy storage
market due to their high energy density and long cycle life compared to other
energy storage systems1. However, commercial LIBs often use liquid
electrolytes (such LiPF6 in ECDEC organic solvent), which have a variety of
safety, thermal and toxicity concerns, some of which are uniquely problematic
in the emerging electric vehicle market2, 3. It is thought these concerns can be
addressed by use of an allsolidstate battery (ASSB), where the flammable
electrolyte is replaced with an inorganic solidstate electrolyte (SSE). Additionally, ASSBs would also allow higher energy density cells by enabling
use of highperformance cathode materials and anodic lithium metal. Therefore SSEs have attracted considerable attention in the field of next
generation LIBs4, 5.
