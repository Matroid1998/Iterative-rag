Description:
An enantiomer of LHisDPheDPheNH2 used in equimolar coassembly to enhance catalytic activity.

of Damino acids can 
confer further advantages, such as increased resistance against enzymatic degradation. For this reason, 
we designed LHisDPheDPhe that is catalytic only in its assembled state.17 Subsequent studies 
demonstrated that Cterminal amidation enables a fivefold improvement in catalytic activity under 
analogous conditions.18 Conversely, other modifications, such as Nacetylation or peptide elongation to 
include Ser to serve as nucleophile, resulted in detrimental effects in catalytic performance andor 
gelation ability, thus demonstrating that the design of such minimalistic supramolecular catalysts is not 
trivial.18,19 
In light of these results, we selected the bestperforming catalytic gelator identified from our previous 
research endeavours, i.e. LHisDPheDPheNH2 (Hff), and studied its equimolar coassembly with its 
enantiomer, DHisLPheLPheNH2 (hFF) (Fig. 1A), as a different strategy to further improve catalytic 
activity.
