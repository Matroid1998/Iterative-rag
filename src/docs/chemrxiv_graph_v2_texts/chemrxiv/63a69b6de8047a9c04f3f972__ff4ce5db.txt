Description:
Two-dimensional materials studied for their unique properties.

Text:
Since the discovery of graphene with fascinating physical properties, the research 
on twodimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as 2D monoelemental materials, metal 
chalcogenides, perovskites, etc., has flourished.113 Among them, 2D monoelemental 
crystals have attracted a lot of attention due to exotic electronic properties and 
transport behaviors.8,9,1416 2D monoelemental crystals possess a honeycomb lattice 
structure similar to that of graphene but with different degrees of outofplane 
buckling.
