Enormous progress has been made in recent years
in
the
pursuit
of
roomtemperature
superconduc
tors, mainly driven by metal hydrides. Nearroom
temperature superconductor was predicted 1, 2, synthe
sized 3, discovered 4 and subsequently confirmed 5 in
the LaH system for the first time. In addition, the same
theoretical techniques that led to the discovery of super
conductivity in LaH10 predict even highertemperature
superconductors such as Li2MgH16 with Tc as high as
470 K at 250 GPa 6. However, creation of these super
hydrides requires megabar ( 100 GPa) pressure, which
is a significant hurdle for largescale synthesis.
