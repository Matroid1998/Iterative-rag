Description:
Polycyclic aromatic systems that comprise only benzene rings and are used as model systems for understanding aromaticity.

Text:
Polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) are polycyclic 
aromatic systems (PASs) that comprise only one type of 
ring  benzene. These compounds have long served as 
model systems for understanding the behavior (e.g., 
aromaticity) of polycyclic systems in a broader sense. In 
recent decades, interest in PBHs (and PASs, in general) 
has increased due to their semiconductive properties, 
which make them ideal for applications in organic 
electronics  electronic devices that utilize organic 
molecules instead of traditional metal components. Many types of electronic devices already exist, such as 
organic lightemitting diodes,1 organic field effect 
transistors, and organic solar cells,2,3 and organicbased 
sensors.4 In addition to their costeffectiveness and 
lower environmental impact, electronic devices using 
organic semiconductors exhibit multiple advantageous 
features, 
exceptional 
mechanical flexibility, and 
potential application in transparent electronics.
