Description:
Strapped moieties used as ionophores within an amphiphilic organic scaffold.

The field of ion transport has seen great advancements over the last decade, as potent 
ionophores have been increasingly explored as treatments for disease.1 Recent studies 
have developed small molecule K and Na transporters based on macrocycles such as 
crown ethers2 and strapped calix4pyrrole moieties3 within an amphiphilic organic scaffold. Such ionophores are recognised as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer,3 
microbial infections1s, 1f, 1g and channelopathies,1b, 4 as perturbing the ionic gradients within 
particular cellular environments can lead to apoptosis cell death or the restoration of ionic 
imbalances caused by native channel dysregulation. However, in the quest to develop effective therapeutic agents, it is important to consider both 
the deliverability and potency of new ionophores.
