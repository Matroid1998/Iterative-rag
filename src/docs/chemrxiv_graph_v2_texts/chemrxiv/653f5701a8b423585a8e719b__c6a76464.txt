Description:
Used in gold-catalyzed oxidative C-C cross-coupling reactions with aryl organometallics.

Text:
Over the 
past decade, goldcatalyzed oxidative CC crosscoupling 
reactions with aryl organometallics, such as B, Si, Ge, 
Scheme 1. SuzukiMiyaura reaction general overview 
and present work. and Sn, have been developed as an attractive strategy to 
access various arylated products (Scheme 1b).8 Under 
oxidantfree conditions, visiblelightassisted gold catal
ysis has also become an efficient method for promoting 
selective coupling reactions with aryl organometallics.9 
However, the inherent thermodynamickinetic instability 
and uncontrolled reactivity of many gold(III) complexes,
