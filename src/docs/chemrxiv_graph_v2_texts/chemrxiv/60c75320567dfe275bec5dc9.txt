Description:
A compound often used as a substrate in carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Halogenated derivatives of heteroaromatics and benzene derivatives are often applied as sub
strates in carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom crosscoupling reactions1,2 and are typi
cally prepared by electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS). However, it is often not a priori
obvious at which position(s) halogenation will occur for compounds in the late stages of the
synthesis that contain multiple (hetero)aromatic rings or in compounds that contain both
heteroarene and benzene rings. Consequently, organic chemists tend to install the halogens
early in the synthesis, thereby eectively eliminating a large number of otherwise promising
synthetic routes.
