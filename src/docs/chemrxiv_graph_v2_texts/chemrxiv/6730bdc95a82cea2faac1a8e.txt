Description:
A current collector material for cathodes that may be chemically incompatible with certain chlorides.

Text:
While chlorides 
containing complex ethereal solutions of the above type demonstrated some 
advantages in enhancing the reversibility of Mg anodes, they may be corrosive and 
chemically incompatible with relevant current collectors for cathodes such as 
aluminum, nickel or stainless (SS) foils.11 Therefore, developing novel, stable, 
chloridesfree, less expensive electrolytes that can promote reversible Mg 
depositionstripping in ethereal solutions is important for developing practical 
rechargeable Mg batteries.12 Thereby, working on new electrolyte solutions for Mg
