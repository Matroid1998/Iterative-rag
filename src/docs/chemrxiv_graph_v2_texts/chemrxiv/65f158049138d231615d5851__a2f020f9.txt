Developing generic systems primarily concerns the selection of a suitable liquid membrane. For 
79 
example, 2nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), a much used solvent in EME, has an extraction window 
80 
of 2.2  log P  6.4 for 1  z  2 23. The establishment of generic conditions is also tied to 
81 
the operational stability, which mainly concerns the extraction current produced during transfer 
82 
of charged species. As such, a low current (50 A 24) minimizes the effects of water electrolysis
