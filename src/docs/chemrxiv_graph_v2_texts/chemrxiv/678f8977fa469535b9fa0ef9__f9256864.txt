Description:
Used in electrochemical deposition for forming interconnects in semiconductor devices.

Text:
Copper is the current metal of choice for interconnects between devices in semiconductor 
chips. The copper interconnects are formed by filling recessed features in lowk oxides with 
copper using either atomic layer deposition (ALD) for the smallest features, or 
electrochemical deposition (ECD) for larger features.1 ECD requires an electrically 
conducting surface, and ALD is often used to make a seed layer for the ECD process.2 While 
ECD has become the most widely used method for Cu deposition for interconnects due to its 
ability to deposit highly conformal films with excellent step coverage in highaspectratio 
structures, wetchemical techniques cannot be easily integrated in vacuumcluster tools.
