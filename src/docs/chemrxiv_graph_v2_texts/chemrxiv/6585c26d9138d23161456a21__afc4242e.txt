The service lifetime of AISI 1045 medium carbon steel (also called AISI 1045 steel) and 
aluminum is severely shortened by corrosion, a spontaneous interfacial degradation 
process. AISI 1045 steel is recognized for its strong weldability and high tensile 
strength,1,2 while aluminum has excellent ductility and strengthtoweight ratio.37 Both 
metals are widely accepted for industrial applications. However, corrosion issues can 
result in structural failure in both aqueous and in organic or mixedsolvents environments, 
which leads to enormous economic losses, injuries and even death.820 To avoid such 
failures, it is essential to sense and quantify corrosion in different environments. Quantified sensing of corrosion within organic or mixedsolvent environments is 
challenging, primarily due to the constraints of current assessment methodologies. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202353g68v2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000282865264 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.
