Description:
A natural siderophore used by bacteria to acquire iron.

Text:
The application of natural siderophores as molecular targeting entities is in part 
hampered by their challenging synthetic access, their chemical lability as well as in some cases 
by their limited bacterial spectrum.16, 17, 18, 19 Fortunately, much like piracy, prokaryotes seize 
socalled xenosiderophores (siderophores produced by other organisms or even synthetic 
siderophore mimetics), to satisfy their iron demand.20 Along those lines, we established 
enterobactin analogues based on synthetic DOTAM and MECAM scaffolds as robust, readily 
accessible and variable vectors for bacterial imaging and antibacterial therapy in Gram
negative and Grampositive bacteria.21, 22, 23 
TBDTs are composed of a 22 barrel inserted into the outer membrane, a plug domain that 
closes the channel formed by the barrel, and the TonB box.10,24,25 The incoming ferric 
siderophore from the extracellular space binds to a specific site on the plug domain, promoting
