The following three types of equations are most often applied.1,5

The symbols denote the following K, partition coefficient; E, excess molar refraction; S, solute 
66 
polarizabilitydipolarity parameter; A, solute hydrogen (H)bond donor property; B, solute H
67 
bond acceptor property; V, McGowans molar volume; and L, logarithmic hexadecaneair 
68 
partition coefficient. The lowercase letters are regression coefficients and are typically trained 
69 
with several tens of compounds for which experimental log K and the solute descriptors (i.e., 
70 
E, S, A, B, V, and L) are available.
