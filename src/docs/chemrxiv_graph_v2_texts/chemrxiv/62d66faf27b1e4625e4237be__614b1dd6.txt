Description:
A Lewis basic compound used in zwitterionic Br√∏nsted base formation and catalysis.

In other words, the Lewis
basic phosphine is creating a zwitterionic Brnsted base, which in turn is protonated by another more 
acidic reagent.3 This mode of action is exploited in Michael addition chemistries where pronucleophiles, 
i.e. CH acidic compounds like malonates or thiols, have to be activated upon deprotonation. Since the first 
demonstration in 1973,4 phosphine catalysed Michael reactions of carbon, sulphur and oxygen donors 
have been frequently employed in all areas of organic chemistry,2 including polymer synthesis.5 Among 
Michael donor reagents, oxygen based Michael donors are less frequently used, which has been 
rationalized by a lack of reactivity and selectivity of these reagents compared to e.g.
