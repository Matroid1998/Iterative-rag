Description:
Coordinates with metal ions in Schiff base ligands.

Text:
Schiff base ligands exhibit a wide range of coordination numbers, 
allowing them to form complexes with various metal ions in different 6. The coordination 
number of Schiff base ligands typically ranges from bidentate to hexadentate, with some examples 
of even higher denticity. The coordination number of Schiff base ligands plays a crucial role in 
determining the structure, stability, and properties of their metal complexes. This versatility 
contributes to their wide range of applications in catalysis, biological activities, and materials 
science 79.The ability to finetune the denticity and donor atoms of Schiff base ligands makes 
them valuable tools for designing complexes with specific properties and functions. It has been 
demonstrated that coordination with metal ions occurs through azomethine nitrogen 10.
