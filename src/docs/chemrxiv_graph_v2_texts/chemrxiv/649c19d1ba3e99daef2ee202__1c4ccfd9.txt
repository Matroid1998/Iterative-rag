Description:
Part of hybrid electrolytic systems for next generation LIB electrolytes.

By 
comparison, 
ionic 
liquids 
based 
on 
the 
FSI 
anion 
show 
reversible 
Li 
intercalationextraction at graphite electrodes, whereas TFSI containing ionic liquids do not 
form stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and thus, do not allow reversible Li 
intercalationextraction on the graphite electrode. Clearly, it is important to balance the 
prospects of developing hybrid electrolytes with enhanced electrochemical properties against 
any concerns of stability of these compounds. With this in mind, the purpose of the current 
study is to present detailed structural and electronic insights of imidazolium EMI 
bis(trifluorosulfonyl)imide TFSIbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide FSI hybrid electrolytic systems, 
and their mixtures with ethylene carbonate (EC)dimethyl carbonate (DMC), which are 
potential candidates for next generation LIB electrolytes.
