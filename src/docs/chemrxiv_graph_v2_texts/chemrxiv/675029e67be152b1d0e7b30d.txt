Description:
Forms polar structures with trigonal lattices when present at specific positions in subphthalocyanine.

Text:
of three or more fluorine (F) atoms at the positions 
of subphthalocyanine (SubPc), a bowlshaped conjugated molecule, forms polar 
structures with trigonal lattices ( and , Figure 1) while introducing F at the positions 
of SubPc forms nonpolar structures ( and ).10 In the present study, similar SubPc 
derivatives were synthesized, where chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) is introduced 
in place of F (Supporting Information Part S2 and S3), while analyzing the crystal structures 
of these derivatives. The synthesized eight SubPc derivatives all possess chiral C3symmetry 
(Figure 2). We prepared and characterized 16 crystals with their enantiomers and racemic 
mixtures. The racemic mixtures afford the crystals of the corresponding racemates, 
indicating no chiral resolution.
