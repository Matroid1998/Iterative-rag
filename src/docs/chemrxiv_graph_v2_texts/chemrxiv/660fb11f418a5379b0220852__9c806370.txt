Description:
Compounds with intercalated water molecules and catalytic activity not restricted to the outer material surface.

Text:
These are (oxy)hydroxides with intercalated water molecules and a catalytic activity that is not restricted to 
the outer material surface.1925 
Adsorbed reaction intermediates might be affected directly by the electrode potential via the corresponding 
Fermi level; the solvent pH might affect reaction rates directly via the concentration of hydrated protons (H3O) 
and hydroxide ions (OH) at the reaction active sites.11, 2629 We provide evidence that neither electrode
