Description:
A moiety that needs to be preserved when using TEMPO as an antibiofouling agent.

Text:
To effectively use TEMPO as an antibiofouling agent, 
the capability to coat the surface of a wide range of 
materials and preserve the nitroxide moiety is required. Recently, plasma polymerisation has been shown to fulfil 
these requirements4,9,10. Plasma polymerisation is a one
step, solventfree, and energyefficient process11 to coat 
surfaces with thin, functional films of organic molecules 
without altering the substrate material bulk properties. As 
a result, it is exceptionally versatile across a wide range of 
industrial applications such as antifouling9,12, biomolecule 
immobilisation1315, water purification1618, electronics19, 
and green energy20,21. Although plasma polymerisation is 
considered a mature technology, many fundamental 
questions remain around the initial growth stages and the 
uniformity and ordering within the polymer layers.
