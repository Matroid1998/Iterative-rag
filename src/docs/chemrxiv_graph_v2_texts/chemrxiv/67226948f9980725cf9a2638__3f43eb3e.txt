Description:
A notable example of a synthesized stable radical.

Text:
Nonetheless, several
stable radicals have been synthesized by utilizing steric protecting and polar substituents to
stabilize them.1518 The first stable radical is the triphenylmethyl radical which was synthe
sised by Gomberg in 1900.19 Since then several radicals have been synthesized with nitroxide
substituted nitronyl nitroxide, nitroxidesubstituted iminonitroxide, and mxylylene being
some of the notable examples.2022 Blatters radical, first synthesized by Blatter and his team
in 1968 has gained a lot of interest in recent years due to its remarkable stability to air and
water.23 The synthesis of nitronylnitroxide substituted Blatters radical by Rajca et al.
