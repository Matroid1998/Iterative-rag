Description:
Involved in methanation reactions with a focus on catalyst surface interactions.

Text:
A possible pathway to implement transient, intrinsic processes on the 
micro scale was most recently presented by Kreitz et al. for CO2 methanation reaction with 
focus on the catalyst surface 14,15. Focusing on the micro scale, studies typically use forced input temperatures or concentrations 
of the reactants to observe the kinetic processes at the catalyst surface by measuring the 
transient response via mass spectrometry (MS) 16. There are different input signals and 
several experimental techniques available to evaluate the dynamic processes of a reaction 
system, which usually use ramp, step and periodic changes of a state variable with time 16. SteadyState Isotopic Transient Kinetics Analysis (SSITKA) combines steadystate and 
transient techniques by step or pulsewise injecting an isotopically labeled species into the
