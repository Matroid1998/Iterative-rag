Description:
A homopolymer that is less opaque, with lower impact strength and chemical resistance compared to ABS.

Polymers, due to their versatile mechanical and physical properties, play an indispensable role 
in everyday life with applications in numerous industries and products. These properties can 
be attributed to the polymers molecular weight distribution (MWD)1,2, as well as the identity 
of the monomers that make up the final polymer3, among other factors4. Terpolymerization, 
which involves the simultaneous polymerization of three monomers, has commercial 
significance due to its potential to create polymers with unique properties absent in their 
corresponding homopolymers, allowing for greater customization of polymer properties5. One 
example is acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene (ABS), a tough material used for consumer products 
made through injection molding6,7. In comparison to its homopolymer polystyrene, ABS is 
opaque, exhibits good impact strength, and improved chemical resistance.
