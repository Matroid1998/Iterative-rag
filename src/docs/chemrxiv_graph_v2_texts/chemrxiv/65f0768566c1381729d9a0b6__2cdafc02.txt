Description:
Moiety used in the synthesis of 4chloro hep tamethine scaffold.

Text:
In this context, latestage functionalization of 
existing heptamethine dyes primarily focuses on the re
placement of center chloride in the popular 4chloro hep
tamethine scaffold, which is synthesized from the con
densation between two heterocyclic salt moiety and an 
accessible Schiff base bearing the chloride (Figure 1).58,17 
Such replacement can take place via the substitution reac
tion with N, O or S nucleophiles, whose products can be 
labile under physiological conditions,1823 or coupling re
actions to form robust CC bonds, although the conver
sion usually requires high temperature and prolonged 
reaction time that can be harmful to the fluorophore 
(Figure 1).24,25 On the other hand, more complex modifica
tion on the polymethine chain, including bulky 4
substitutions or substitutions on other positions, requires 
the bottomup synthesis of the fluorophore core, such as
