Description:
Nonmagnetic nanoparticles used in dielectric nanofluids.

Text:
It was seen that the dielectric breakdown strength 
75 
(DBS) of mineral oil was dependent on external magnetic field direction 3. Later, several 
76 
nonmagnetic nanoparticles such as TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, BN  etc gained their due importance 
77 
in this field 47. In the last decade, along with electrical insulation, the idea of dielectric 
78 
nanofluids was extended towards improving the cooling performance of insulating fluids 8. 79 
Parallelly, research using some alternative oils as base oil such as ester vegetable oils were 
80 
conducted due to poor biodegradability of mineral oil 9. 81 
The mechanism of electrical breakdown is extremely complicated. It depends upon various 
82 
parameters of base fluid (moisture content, viscosity, temperature) 10, measurement 
83 
protocols 11, purity 12 etc.
