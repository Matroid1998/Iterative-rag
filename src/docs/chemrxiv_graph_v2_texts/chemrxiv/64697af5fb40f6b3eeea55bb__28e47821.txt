Description:
A material whose piezoelectric response is significantly enhanced when alloyed with ScN.

Text:
Alloying AlN with ScN has
been found to significantly enhance the piezoelectric response,
with up to 40 increase in d33 compared to pristine AlN.11,12
Er3 and Yb3, which are larger cations than Sc3, have been ef
fectively substituted at x  0.015 and up to approximately x 
0.15, respectively.13,14 The utilization of trace amounts of Gd3
ions in AlN and GaN has been primarily explored in the context of
optoelectronics such as cathodoluminescence and fieldemission
devices.1517 In our recent work, we have successfully grown
thinfilm wurtzite Al1xGdxN with higher Gd content (up to x 
0.25)18 than previously reported.1923
While laboratory Xray probes suggest high crystalline fidelity,
it is also well known that AlNbased alloys harbor atomicscale
