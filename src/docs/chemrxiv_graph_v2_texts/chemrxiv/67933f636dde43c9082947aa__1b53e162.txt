Description:
Terpene trilactones found in Ginkgo biloba extracts.

Text:
The Ginkgo biloba tree, endemic to China and Korea, has been 
used in traditional medicine for millennia for the treatment of 
agerelated memory loss, inflammation and other ailments.1 
The extracts from this tree contain several terpene trilactones 
exclusive to this species namely the ginkgolides (Figure 1A). The 
structures of the ginkgolides were elucidated by Nakanishi et al. in 1967.

Description:
Natural products for which truncated analogues have been synthesized.

Text:
This highlights the power of these reaction 
manifolds in the construction of CC quaternary bonds in 
congested environments.14 Secondly, the tertbutyl group was 
invariably incorporated into these natural products via the 
coppermediated conjugate additionSN2 reaction of tertbutyl 
lithium. Further to these studies, the synthesis of truncated analogues 
of the ginkgolides has also been investigated (Figure 1C).

Description:
Compounds involved in a palladium-catalysed cycloaddition to synthesize spirocycle.

Text:
Trost 
published an alternative cycloaddition strategy to rings A and B 
of the ginkgolides, in this instance using a 32 palladium
catalysed cycloaddition to synthesise spirocycle 6.21 Magnus 
constructed these same rings via alkylation of cyclopentadiene 
and oxidation with singlet oxygen.22 Finally, Toyota and co
workers described the synthesis of spirotricycle 8 through a 
Pd(II)catalysed oxidative cyclisation.23 None of the reported 
synthesis of truncated fragments, however, included the 
construction of the adjacent allcarbon stereocentres.
