Description:
A dopant used in silicon substrates for semiconductor applications.

Furthermore, advanced CMOS devices also require the 
use of ntype Si to enable doped sourcedrain regions for 
DRAM peripheries 1820. The ntype Si growth is enabled by doing single
wafer CVD deposition of SiP on Si substrate. The substrate 
has a small Boron doping, from the manufacturer, in the 
range of  1015cm3. Epitaxial growth allows one to create 
films that have high activated doping, by virtue of 
substitutional doping. In epitaxial deposition, the depositing 
film templates on top of a crystalline material. Furthermore, 
the inherent high crystallinity of the films ensure that they 
exhibit superior material and transport properties such as 
high mobility, low impuritydefect scattering and high 
thermal stability 21.
