Description:
Studied as a novel class of potential antimicrobial and antioxidant agents.

Text:
2,3Dimethyl ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate, PCA is reported in synthesis of 
styrene copolymers 1, and in catalytic studies related to polymer networks carrying tertiary 
amines as a catalyst inside microflow reactors 2. 3,4Dimethyl ringsubstituted propyl 
PCA is involved in radical copolymerization with ethenyl benzene 3. 2,5Dimethylphenyl 
ethyl PCA is mentioned in catalysis studies with amino acid amide based ionic liquid as 
catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation 4, in DFT study for the synthesis of 2amino3
ethoxycarbonyl4(aryl)4Hpyrano3,2cchromen5one derivatives as novel class of 
potential antimicrobial and antioxidant agents 5. 2,5Ddimethylphenyl 2methylpropyl 
PCA was copolymerized styrene resulting alternating structures 6. 3,4Dimethylphenyl 
ethyl ester of (2Z)2cyano2butenoic acid is reported in pharmaceutical compositions 
including thienopyrimidine derivatives as potassium channel inhibitors for use in the 
treatment of arrhythmias 7.
