Description:
Undergoes Diels-Alder dimerization with negative activation and reaction volumes.

Text:
For example, in the case of a bond formation reaction 

3 
between two molecules (Figure 1), a negative  is expected since the unimolecular 
transition state is more compact and hence has a smaller volume than the two separated 
reactant molecules. The opposite is usually true for bond cleavage reactions. Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the activation volume and reaction volume (both are 
negative) of a DielsAlder dimerization of 1,3cyclohexadiene.
