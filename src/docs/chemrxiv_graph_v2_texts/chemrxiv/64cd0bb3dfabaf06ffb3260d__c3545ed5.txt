Description:
Acts as a catalyst in the Biginellitype reaction to produce 2,3dihydro1,2,6thiadiazine 1oxides.

Text:
Accordingly, our amazing has been even more when only two papers 
described the synthesis of thiadiazine1,1dioxides from sulfamide via a Biginellilike approach, 
while using nonclassical cyclization partners. In one, the thiadiazine1,1dioxides core was 
obtained using the recyclization of an 8member adduct of 2 molecules NH2SO2NH2 and 2 molecules 
(EtO)2CHCH2CO2Et with aryl aldehyde. This method was developed in a course of evaluation of SO2 
isosteric replacement in analogous of Biginellitype compound MAL1127, active in a Model of 
Huntingtons Disease 12. Another paper obtained the bicyclic structure with a specific methylene
active component  hexane1,3dione. 13 (Figure 1, C). Finally, Bolm and coworkers described 
the Biginellitype reaction with sulfonimidamides leading to 2,3dihydro1,2,6thiadiazine 1oxides 
under solventfree mechanochemical conditions catalyzed by AcOH or Yb(OTf)3 14.
