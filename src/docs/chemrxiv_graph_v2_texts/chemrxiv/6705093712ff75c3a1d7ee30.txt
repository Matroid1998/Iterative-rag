of orthosubstituents 
significantly enhances H abstraction due to diminished 
reductive elimination kinetics. A novel photoredox catalyst (Ir3) 
has been carefully designed, incorporating the capability of 
performing SET and EnT in the same reaction mixture for 
obtaining stereoselective enamides. Ultimately, we have 
successfully performed the synthesis of diversely functionalized 
arylated (Z)enamides in up to excellent yields and selectivity. The 
mechanistic details, in particular with regards to the steric effects 
of this methodology on the nickel catalytic cycle were elucidated 
and are currently under further investigation in our laboratory. The 
careful modulation of redox states of nickel catalysts will enable 
the design and development of new catalytic reactivities in the 
future.
