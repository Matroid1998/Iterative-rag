Description:
A ring structure used as the core scaffold in therapeutics and other bioactive molecules due to its easy accessibility, rich substitutional patterns, and structural rigidity.

The function of a molecule is closely related to its threedimensional architecture.1 This is 
especially true in medicinal chemistry, wherein the precise orientation of each 
pharmacophore is key for determining the strength and selectivity of proteinligand 
interaction.2 In this regard, the benzene ring, due to its easy accessibility, rich 
substitutional patterns and structural rigidity, has been ubiquitously used as the core 
scaffold in therapeutics and other bioactive molecules.3 Nevertheless, to avoid the 
potential undesirable metabolic instability under physiological conditions, the search for 
stable alternatives to replace the benzene ring is of great interest for improved lead 
identification and 
therapeutic 
success.
