Description:
Used in visible-light-mediated dual catalysis for azidoarylation of alkenes.

One of 
the classical methods is the Meerwein arylation that involves a re
ductive generation of aryl radicals from highly reactive precursors 
(aryldiazonium or diaryliodonium salts), followed by radicalpolar 
crossover and trapping of the resulting carbocation with excess nu
cleophiles.9 In 2021, the Gaunt group reported an excellent study 
on the vicinal azidoarylation of alkenes using diaryliodonium salts 
as aryl radical sources and NaN3 as the heteroatom source, via a 
visiblelightmediated dual copper catalysis, to access aryl az
idoalkanes.10 However, the use of these reactive radical precursors 
presents challenges for the latestage modification of complex bio
active molecules due to difficulties in accessing them. Conversely, 
readily available (hetero)arenes, which are prevalent in pharmaceu
tically relevant molecules, represent ideal aryl radical precursors 
(Figure 1C).

To 
overcome this challenge, an elegant indirect approach using arylthi
anthrenium salts as aryl radical precursors was introduced by Ritter 
and coworkers in 2019,11 and it has since been widely employed 
in twocomponent reactions.12 The air and benchstable arylthi
anthrenium salts can be derived from (hetero)arenes with excellent 
yield and site selectivity through electrophilic thianthrenation or a 
complementary Ircatalyzed regioselective borylation followed by 
Cumediated thianthrenation for latestage functionalization of 
complex bioactive molecules.11,12b More recently, Ritter and co
workers extended the application of this strategy to threecompo
nent reactions, enabling bromoarylation and aminoarylation of al
kenes through photoredox and copper dual catalysis.13 Despite 
these recent advances, the development of a unified synthetic plat
form capable of rapidly assembling diverse 1,2aryl heteroatomic
