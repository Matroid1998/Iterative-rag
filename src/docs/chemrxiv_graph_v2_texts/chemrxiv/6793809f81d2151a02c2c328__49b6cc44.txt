Description:
React with isocyanates in the Wittig reaction to synthesize ketenimines.

Text:
Ketenimines 
have been synthesized using a variety of different 
methods, with the Wittig reaction between phosphorus 
ylides and isocyanates, or between azaWittig reagents 
and ketenes being among the most commonly employed 
approaches.7,8,9 Further methods involve the coupling of 
stable singlet or Fischer carbenes with isonitriles,10,11,12 or 
the rearrangement of ynamines through a 1,3shift of a 
leaving 
group 
from 
the 
nitrogen 
to 
the 
carbon 
atom.13,14,15,16 
sBlock metal keteniminyl anions represent promising 
reagents to access ketenimines via simple nucleophilic 
substitution reactions. However, these anions have only 
poorly been described in present literature and no isolation 
has been attempted so far.
