confirmed the correlation of the two factors, except that the sub
strates underwent a directional change of the amine extension 
from the amyloidbiding site (2a and 2b). Again, the correlation 
of the binding affinity and yield is consistent with the mecha
nism of CASL, in which the amyloidsubstrate complexation is 
key to promoting the reaction. To demonstrate the generality of amine modification CASL, 
we next turned our attention to the reaction scope (Fig. 3C). Three kinds of reactions in acidic buffer that had difficulty pro
ceeding in the absence of an amyloid catalyst (NL6 amyloid ) 
were selected. CASL using NL6 amyloid and 1 in combination 
with 2,4dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) gave the SNAr product 
(1DNB) in 56 yield (condition i).
