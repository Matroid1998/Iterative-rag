Description:
A perovskite material where NH3CH2CH2NH2 substitutes for CH3NH3 to produce hollow structures.

hollow perovskites,5 and the B site, e.g. Fe2 substitutes for
Fe3 in Prussian Blue11. In hybrid perovskites, these charged
point defects are typically compensated by lowenergy point de
fects of the opposite charge, most commonly vacancies, rather
than by electronic defects.12 For example, in the hollow lead
