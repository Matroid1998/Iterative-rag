Description:
Used in catalysis with the ability to alter the distribution of Al centers to tune active sites.

Text:
In the field of zeolite catalysis, which is of 
10 
paramount industrial importance, numerous synthetic approaches have been reported which alter 
the distribution of Al centers in order to tune the distribution of their associated active sites1417. But even after decades of study, distinct ordered Al arrangements cannot be accessed at will7,1820. The need to control metal distances received further impetus with the advent of single atom 
catalysis (SAC), where substantial performance improvements could be attributed to metal 
15 
centers in certain distance ranges8,1013. MOFs offer a strategic advantage in that both the primary 
coordination environment and the spacing of metal sites is precisely determined by the crystalline 
lattice.
