Description:
Large macrocycles with extended conjugation systems exhibiting characteristic electronic and electrochemical properties.

For many decades, Fe(III) porphyrin systems have been extensively studied in literature on account of their 
remarkable physical properties and interesting applications13 as well as their crucial role in biological 
systems.48 Porphyrins being large macrocycles, have plenty of electrons forming extended conjugation 
system due to which they exhibit characteristic electronic913 and electrochemical properties1416 both in 
solid state as well as in solution. Fe(III)X tetraphenylporphyrins (XBr, Cl, I, NCS) usually forms highspin complexes with S  52 spin 
ground state.17, 18 Nevertheless, a spinstate switching phenomenon has been observed by Korszun and 
Mofat19 between the fivecoordinate highspin isothiocyanato methaemoglobin and the sixcoordinate low
spin histidine ligated isothiocyanato methaemoglobin.

Description:
Mononuclear compounds requiring knowledge of crystal and electronic structure for understanding their coordination environment.

Till now, various literature published on the 
ambidentate thiocyanate ligand ligated Fe(III) tetraphenylporphyrin have shown the electronic and 
magnetic properties in solution along with their theoretical justification.2023 However, a complete 
electrochemical study in solution as well as magnetic properties in the solid state have not been investigated 
so far. Proper justification of the highspin state of Fe(III) with uniaxial anisotropy in this particular 
coordination environment is also another area of interest that requires considerable knowledge of the crystal 
and electronic structure of these mononuclear porphyrins.
