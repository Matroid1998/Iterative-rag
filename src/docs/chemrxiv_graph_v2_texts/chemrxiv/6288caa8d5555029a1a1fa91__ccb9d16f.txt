Description:
A single-component system widely studied in organic photocatalysis.

Text:
In OPVs,
charge separation can be promoted by blending an electronrich donor material with an
electronpoor acceptor material. Charge separation occurs at the donoracceptor interface,
where there is an energetic driving force for the transfer of an electron from the donor to the
acceptor.11 In organic photocatalysis, singlecomponent systems such as carbon nitride and
donoracceptor copolymers have been widely studied, but donoracceptor blend materials
have only recently gained interest.10,12
