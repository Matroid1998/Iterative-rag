Description:
Components of bamboo along with cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.

Text:
Bamboo is a kind of biomass material with short growth cycle and excellent performance. Known as 
the Kingdom of Bamboo, China is the worlds richest country in bamboo resources 1, 2. Compared 
with other wood materials, bamboo has high output and low price. Similar to wood, the chemical 
compositions of bamboo are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as well as other ingredients such as 
sugars, fats, proteins, and inorganic salts 3. In bamboo, cellulose accounts for 44 of the total 
bamboo, and lignin accounts for 20. Additionally, the content of pentosan in bamboo is close to that 
of broadleaf wood and other nonwood plant materials.
