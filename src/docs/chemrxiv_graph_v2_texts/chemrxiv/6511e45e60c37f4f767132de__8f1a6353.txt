Description:
Acts as an epimerization-proof synthetic precursor to the primary asparagine amide.

Text:
The synthesis of the western fragment 
3 branched tryptophanasparagine motif (Figure 1, highlighted in 
green) was envisioned in the same fashion by addition of 2methyl 
furan into the corresponding aziridine 7. In this case, furan acts as 
an epimerizationproof synthetic precursor to the primary 
asparagine amide, to be unveiled towards the end of the synthesis. With a strategy in hand to address the challenge of synthesizing the 
bbranched amino acids 6 and 7, our attention next turned to 
construction of the two macrocycles and final assembly of 2. The synthesis of 2 is outlined in Scheme 1.
