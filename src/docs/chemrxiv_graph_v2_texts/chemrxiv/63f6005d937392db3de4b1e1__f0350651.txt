Description:
Organic compounds that can undergo C(sp3)H bond activation under nickel-catalyzed conditions.

Mechanistically, the underlying nickelcatalyzed C(sp2)H bond activation process operates 
via a ligandtoligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT)29 instead of the typical oxidative addition 
process30. The C(sp2)C(sp3)reductive elimination is considered as the rate determining step 
(Figure 1b). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that an extension of this concept could 
help to address the C(sp3)H bond of ketones under comparable conditions and open new 
catalysis manifold for ketone functionalizations (Fig. 1c). This pivotal step could be either 
envisaged by coordination of the ketone and acceptor olefin to the nickel(0) triggering a LLHT 
of the carbonyl C(sp3)H. The LLHT would involve a 7membered transition state and lead 
to a favorable oxaallyl nickel(II) species. Alternatively, one could formulate a C(sp3)H 
oxidative addition forming oxaallyl nickel(II) hydride.
