Description:
Channels that lower the membrane potential, increasing the activation time required for neuronal firing.

Although several
new antiepileptic drugs are available now, in addition to the set of timetested antiepileptics, novel
personalized antiepileptic drugs with improved consistency in efficacy and lower toxicity are
desirable because of variability in the response of individuals to available antiepileptic drugs (Song
et al., 2022). gAmino Butyric Acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The abnormal increase in
neuronal activity that is observed in epileptic seizures can be controlled in many cases by increasing
the activity of the GABAA receptors (Castellano et al., 2020). GABAA receptors are Chloride ion
channels, and opening of the Chloride ion channels lowers the membrane potential, resulting in an
increase in the time or activation required for crossing the threshold for activation of neuronal
firing.
