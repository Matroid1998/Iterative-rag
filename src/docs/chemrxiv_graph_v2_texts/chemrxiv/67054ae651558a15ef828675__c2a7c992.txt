Description:
Requires exfoliation and dispersion of stacked sheets for utilization in nanocomposites.

As a binarybased material, hBN exhibits properties such as a large band 
gap (5.9eV),1719 high oxidative resistance,20 and inertness towards most chemicals.1,21 The 
differences in the polarity of B and N hinder the delocalization of the pi electrons, thus preventing 
conjugation.17,22 This is unlike graphene, whose lack of a band gap results from fully delocalized 
pi electrons. Despite the lack of conjugation, the basal plane of hBN sheets is hydrophobic23,24 as 
the nitrogen and boron atoms are less polar due to sp2 hybridization.4,17,25 However, like graphite, 
the hBN stacked sheets must be exfoliated and dispersed for many of the extraordinary properties 
to be utilized in nanocomposites.26,27
