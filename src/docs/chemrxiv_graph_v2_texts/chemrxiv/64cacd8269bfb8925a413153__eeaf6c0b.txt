Description:
A transition metal used as a catalyst in organic chemistry.

Text:
The tremendous advancements in organic chemistry 
and the success of the chemical science industries in the past 
century can be credited to catalysts based on transition metals 
such as palladium, platinum, cobalt, rhodium, gold, ruthenium, 
and rare earth metals. However, the past decade has also wit
nessed a renaissance in using cheap and abundant firstrow 
transition metals such as Ni, Cu, and Fe as catalysts in organic 
synthesis. Numerous academic and industrial processes now 
involve firstrow transition metals catalysts supported with 
cheap ligand frameworks.1 The seminal reports of Baran,23 
MacMillan,4 Doyle,5 Molander,6 Weix,79 Lin,1011 Fu,12 Reis
man,13 Diao,1415 and others1617 in merging redox perturba
tion (photochemical, electrochemical, and purely chemical) 
with catalysis are pivotal to the resurgence and mechanistic 
understanding of firstrow transition metalbased catalysis.

Description:
A catalyst often used in powerful cross-coupling reactions such as Suzuki, Kumada-Corriu, Negishi, and Stille.

Text:
Owing to the wide range of oxidation states in which 
firstrow metals can exist, their reactivity towards radical 
intermediates allows them to forge bonds from easytoaccess 
radical precursors. For the sake of illustration, consider a gen
eral C(sp2)C(sp3) linkage. Following conventional retrosyn
thetic analysis along the lines of polar bond disconnections 
would lead to powerful crosscoupling tactics such as Suzuki, 
KumadaCorriu, Negishi, and Stille most often mediated by a 
palladium catalyst (Figure 1A).1820 In such cases, the nucleo
philic component is either introduced as a C(sp2) anion equiv
alent (organomagnesium, organozinc, organoboron, etc.) which can impact chemoselectivity and functional group com
patibility.
