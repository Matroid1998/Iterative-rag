Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential in catalysis13 as they promise to
17
marry the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.4 Their high metal
18
concentrations and nearly fully exposed active sites,5 make them close to ideal single
19
site catalysts sought after in heterogeneous catalysis.68 A challenge is controlling the
20
metals coordination environment, which in MOFs is often limited by the geometries of
21
available secondary building units.9,10 ZrMOFs, composed of hexameric Zroxo cluster
22
Zr6O4(OH)4(RCOO)12 (where RCOO represents carboxylic acid ligands), exemplify this
23
concept, with clusters functioning as the smallest possible ZrO2 catalyst.11,12 Their reactiv
24
ity is not only shaped by the design principle of reticular chemistry but to a great extent by
25
defects.3,13,14

Keeping the analogy to bulk ZrO2 catalysts, the typical Zr6 ( hexameric Zr oxo
