Description:
Involved in ATRP reactions facilitated by microbial external electron transfer (EET).

Text:
It has been previously shown that 
electrogenic Cupriavidus metallidurans (C. met)1417 and Escherichia coli (E. 
coli) are able to start Fe ATRP reactions.4 Metal ion reduction takes place via 
microbial external electron transfer (EET) involving membrane bound C type 
Cytochrome (CCyt) proteins, possibly in combination with synergistic Fe 
homeostasis efflux pumps.9 To further understand the role of microbial EET in 
Fe catalysis and resulting polymerisation, CCyt (NapC of E. coli) was our 
engineering target. CCyt was chosen as a target to mediate cell instructed 
ATRP as cytochromes are known to play a substantial role in bacterial EET that 
is required for energy production, particularly involving the reduction of metal 
ions.1821 The electron transport chain of S. oneidensis MR1 is well researched
