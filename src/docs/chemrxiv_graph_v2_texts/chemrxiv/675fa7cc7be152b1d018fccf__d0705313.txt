Description:
A scaffold for thermally robust conjugated radicals used in Blatter's radical.

Text:
The radicals moieties are typically stabi
lized by screening the paramagnetic center sterically or through the spatial delocalization of
the unpaired electron, even though the integration of the persistent radical species to func
tionalize the highly conductive and stable single molecule devices has remained as a major
challenge. One class of thermally robust conjugated radical based on 1,2,4benzotriazinyl
scaffold is Blatters radical (shown in Figure 1a).
