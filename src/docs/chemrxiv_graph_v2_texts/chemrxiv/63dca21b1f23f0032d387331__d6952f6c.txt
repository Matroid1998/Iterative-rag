Description:
A side product formed by many Nitrogen Reduction Reaction molecular catalysts.

Text:
The nitrogenase model of N2 fixation has been 
thoroughly investigated and had inspired the 
development 
of 
several 
catalysts 
914. Unfortunately, most of these catalysts use sacrificial 
reductants. Of late the focus has shifted to achieve this 
singularly important transformation electrochemically 
as electricity produced from carbon neutral sources 
such as wind, solar or hydro will render it sustainable 
in the long run 15. Electrochemical N2 fixation has 
emerged as an alternative which holds the promise of 
achieving transformation of N2 to NH3 under mild 
conditions 1618. Instances of Nitrogen fixation yielding N2H4 as the 
major product as opposed to NH3 are scarce. Many 
NRR (Nitrogen Reduction Reaction) molecular 
catalysts form N2H4 as a side product, out of which Fe

Description:
The only nitrogenous product formed from the reduction of N2 by Ni3S82.

Text:
was the first to reverse the 
trend, forming N2H4NH3 in the ratio of 241 19. Of 
late a remarkable finding was reported by Dey and co
workers wherein they have developed the first 
molecular complex Ni3S82 which reduces N2 to 
N2H4 
as 
the 
only 
nitrogenous 
product 
electrochemically 20. The intermediates involved in the catalytic mechanism 
have not been identified and the underlying 
mechanism 
was 
unclear 
from 
the 
reported 
experimental findings. Furthermore, there are hardly 
any precedents of NRR by Ni. The situation is 
complicated due to competing NRR and HER 
(Hydrogen evolution reaction) at similar reduction 
potentials 21. Hence it presents a wonderful 
opportunity for theoretical comprehension of the 
mechanistic roadmap of this intriguing and unique 
Scheme 1 Reaction studied in this work. 2
