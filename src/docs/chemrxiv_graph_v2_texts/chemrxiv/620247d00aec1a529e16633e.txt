Description:
A material with anticipated magnetic properties, particularly in armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs).

Text:
Edge or end states in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and in particular armchair 
GNRs (AGNRs) have attracted very much interest lately,18 due to their anticipated magnetic 
properties,910 although their presence in finite nanographenes (NGRs) has been predicted long time 
ago.11 However, the significance and importance of end states for AGNRs was recognized only 
recently18, after the pioneering bottomup synthesis of atomically precise AGNRs of finite lengths 
L with short zigzag ends, and their characterization by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and 
spectroscopy (STS). 316 Clearly no end states appear in the common infinite AGNRs fabricated by 
the usual topbottom techniques, which are theoretically described by periodic boundary conditions 
at their two ends1.
