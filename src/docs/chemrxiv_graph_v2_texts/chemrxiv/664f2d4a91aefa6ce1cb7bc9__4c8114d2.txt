Description:
A polymer used largely as short-lived packaging material with limited recycling potential.

Text:
Plastics, currently produced 
at a scale of 400 million tons per year and projected to reach a 
yearly production capacity of 1 billion tons by 2050,1,2 lack 
sufficient endoflife options and are thus accumulating in the 
environment.3 Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are 
particularly challenging as they account for 452 of global 
plastic production and are largely used as shortlived 
packaging materials4 with limited recycling potential.58 
Currently, polyolefins are mainly recycled industrially via 
mechanical recycling processes, requiring high purity PE and 
PP streams. Nevertheless, in mechanical recycling, the product 
quality decreases with each recycling loop. This effect is 
attributed to the thermal and mechanical stress on the 
polymer during recycling, which can result in chain shorting.

Description:
An essential chemical and intermediate in the petrochemical industry.

The decrease in quality is further facilitated by the presence of 
different additives, such as flame retardants, pigments and 
plasticizers.8 However, new chemical recycling technologies 
based on olefin metathesis reaction which can convert PE with 
ethylene to propylene have recently been proposed as an 
important alternative and could be demonstrated by Scott and 
Guironnet,9 Hartwig10 and in our laboratories.11,12 These 
technologies offer the possibility to use polyolefin waste as a 
feedstock for the chemical industry. Moreover, the propylene 
product of this transformation is widely used in the 
petrochemical industry to provide essential chemicals and 
intermediates, e.g. polypropylene, propylene oxide, butanal, 
acrolein, acryl nitrile or isopropanol.
