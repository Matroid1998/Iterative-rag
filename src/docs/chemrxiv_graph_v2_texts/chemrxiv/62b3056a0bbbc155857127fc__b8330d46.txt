1a), 
representing a strategy for the design of a variety of prodrugs, 
considering that OHfunctionalized compounds account for a 
large number of FDAapproved smallmolecule therapeutics.8 
However, only limited secondorder rate constants (k2) of less 
than 0.001 M1s1 have been observed for the IEDDA reaction of 
vinyl ethers and Tz.8 Versteegen et al. have subsequently 
developed rTCOethers and rTCOcarbonates that react 
substantially faster with Tz (k2 10 M1s1), leading to click
triggered release of alcohols and phenols (Fig. 1b).9 However, in 
the case of rTCOethers only slow elimination was observed, 
requiring 30 hours to obtain 80 of the released alcohol or 
phenol. While clicktorelease of phenolic rTCOcarbonates was 
found to proceed significantly faster (80 after approx.

Description:
Compounds that can be efficiently eliminated using bioorthogonal cleavage with a self-immolative linker.

15 hours), 
these compounds were reported to degrade rapidly under 
biological conditions (complete hydrolysis after 5 hours in 50 
mouse serum at 37 C),9 impeding application of this strategy in 
the development of clickactivatable prodrugs. To facilitate bioorthogonal cleavage of rTCOcaged phenols 
while achieving high precursor stability, we envisioned the 
implementation of a selfimmolative linker (SIL) that enables the 
use of carbamate linkages instead of ethers and carbonates. Here, we show that N,Ndimethylethylenediamine (DMEDA) can 
be used as a minimal SIL to facilitate efficient bioorthogonal 
elimination of phenols (Fig. 1c).
