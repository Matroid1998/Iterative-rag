Description:
A conducting polymer used in bioelectronic devices due to its high biocompatibility and ease of synthesis.

Text:
However, for in vivo or in vitro 
implementation, the material requirements must be further extended to consider the biological 
properties. In particular, the ability of the material to support and facilitate cell growth is paramount to 
enabling these technologies. Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) were amongst the first materials 
to constitute bioelectronic devices owing to their high biocompatibility and ease of synthesis.11 
However, low processability of the materials after synthesis limited their further development. More 
recently, synthetic efforts to ensure mixed ionicelectronic conduction focus on the introduction of 
hydrophilic motifs to CPs to allow for interaction with polar environments in organic electrochemical
