Description:
Materials for which very few ALD processes have been published.

Text:
We 
also note that only very few ALD processes has been 
published for carbides, with TaC6 and WCx7 as notable 
examples. The lack of ALD processes for carbides is to a 
large part explained by the lack of a suitable carbon 
precursor. We recently showed that trimethylboron (B(CH3)3, TMB) 
can function as a single source precursor for CVD of boron
carbon thin films at 7001100 C and 5000 Pa in either a 
hydrogen or an argon ambient.8 We observed that the films 
deposited from TMB at 700 C in a H2 ambient were thinner 
than those deposited in Ar ambient.
