Description:
A component relevant to aerosol formation mechanisms.

Text:
The formation and growth of molecular clusters in the atmosphere drive the gastoparticle
conversion process known as new particle formation (NPF). These aerosols contribute to a net
cooling effect on the Earth.1 Almost 50 of newly formed aerosols act as cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN), enhancing cloud formation and the albedo effect.2,3 Additionally, due to their
tiny size, aerosols can transport various molecules, viruses, and bacteria deeply into the
respiratory system, posing health risks.46
While the exact chemical species relevant to aerosol formation mechanisms are poorly
understood, many studies present insight into the most relevant components, such as sul
furic acid, ammonia, dimethylamine, and various oxidation products of volatile organic
