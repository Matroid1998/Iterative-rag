Description:
Employed to increase the water solubility of organic starting materials.

Text:
We use Fe(III)Cl36H2O in 
aqueous solution. Upon exposure to near UV light, homolysis of 
the FeCl bond is induced in the complex. The resulting electro
philic chlorine radical abstracts hydrogen atoms from aliphatic 
CH reactants, generating nucleophilic carboncentred radicals 
that subsequently react with various electronpoor alkenes 
(Scheme 1, c). To enhance yields, simple sugar alcohols and cin
chonidin derivatives were employed to increase the water sol
ubility of the organic starting materials. Additionally, lowering 
the reaction temperature resulted in a positive impact on the 
reaction kinetics, leading to accelerated rates.
