Description:
Synthesized under simulated supercritical CO2 conditions in primordial subseafloor.

Text:
Beyond warm and moderately pressurized conditions (31.1 C and 73.8 
bar), CO2 is present as a supercritical fluid, exhibiting a versatile solvent function owing to its 
intermediate property between liquid and gas. The unique characteristics, coupled with the ease of 
preparation, has led to the use of supercritical CO2 (hereafter referred to scCO2) in a variety of 
chemical and industrial processes that are difficult to be operated in a simple aqueous solution (20). Thus, liquid and scCO2 formed through subseafloor hydrothermal processes likely diversified 
prebiotic chemistry and resultant materials available for the origin of life (8). Here, we demonstrate methanethiol synthesis under a simulated scCO2 condition in primordial 
subseafloor.

Description:
Detected in CO2 and H2S-rich fluid inclusions with an abiotic origin.

Text:
Methanethiol was recently detected in CO2 and H2Srich fluid inclusions in 3.5Gyr
old hydrothermal precipitates with the carbon isotopic composition suggesting an abiotic origin (21). Methanethiol is a necessary ingredient for the synthesis of methyl thioacetate, a presumptive prebiotic 
precursor of acetylCoA central to prebiotic carbon fixation (22, 23). However, the availability of 
methanethiol in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems remains unresolved. Methanethiol has been 
detected in trace amounts in hydrothermal fluids from midocean ridge systems, but has been ascribed 
to thermal destruction of preexisting organic matter (24). Although hydrothermal experiments by
