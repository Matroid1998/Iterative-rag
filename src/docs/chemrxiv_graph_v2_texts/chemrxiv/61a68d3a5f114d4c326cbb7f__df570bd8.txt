Description:
Forms nanostructures that are promising as H2O2 selective catalysts.

Text:
A continual challenge in this direction 
is to develop both an understanding of the reaction process and factors that dictate H2O2 
selectivity, as well as the continual development of effective catalytic systems. In general noble metals,2 transition metalbased materials,3 and carbon nanostructures4 
have emerged as promising H2O2 selective catalysts with each possessing their advantages and 
drawbacks. One recurrent theme is the importance of identifying of the most active catalytic 
motifs within catalysts that possess a wide variety of surface terminations and possible active 
sites.
