Description:
Involved in the transformation of novel PFAS precursors for environmental detection and source tracking.

Text:
However, while the reaction kinetics under oxidative 
53 
conditions have been extensively quantified, the structural transformation of emerging PFAS has 
54 
not been adequately understood.20, 26 Hence, it is important to elucidate the transformation of novel 
55 
PFAS precursors by both SO4 and HO for environmental detection and source tracking. 56
