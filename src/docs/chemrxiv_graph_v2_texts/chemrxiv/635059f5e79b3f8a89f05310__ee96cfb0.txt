Description:
Altering the alkyl and aryl substituents on phosphorus can manipulate steric hindrance and electronic effects.

Josiphostype 
ligands 
are 
commonly 
implemented 
in 
asymmetric catalysis due to their tunability and effectiveness. By 
altering the alkyl and aryl substituents on phosphorus, both 
steric hindrance and electronic effects of the ligand can be 
manipulated to optimize the performance of the catalyst.1 One 
feature of these ligands is that they contain stereocenters close to 
the metal center, which helps impart chirality to the reactive 
substrate.2 Josiphostype ligands are widely used across different 
reaction 
types, 
including 
asymmetric 
allylation,3 
hydrosilylation,4 and hydroboration(Scheme 1a).5 
 The chiral building block that is used as starting material for 
Josiphostype ligands is 1(dimethylamino)ethylferrocene 
((R)1), also known as Ugis amine.
