In this contribution, we first elucidate the use of the BV expressions within the context of multistep multielectron reactions while 
44 
highlighting prevailing misconceptions and their profound impact on the interpretation of electrochemical processes in general. 45 
We continue with a detailed discussion of the HORHER kinetics, one of the simplest multielectron reactions, and its mechanistic 
46 
interpretation on polycrystalline (pc) Pt in particular. We perform an extensive experimental survey of the HORHER in the 
47 
micropolarization, Tafel, and Hupd regions, concluding with the formulation of a new mechanistic description that accounts for 
48 
all the distinctive features observed. To avoid inconsistencies from literature, we start by deriving the ButlerVolmer expression 
49 
from commonly accepted principles. 50
