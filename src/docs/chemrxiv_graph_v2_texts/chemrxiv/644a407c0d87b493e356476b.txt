Description:
Dissolved oxygen (DO) in water bodies is reduced by eutrophication.

Text:
This untreated discharge of WW not only 
49 
contaminates the freshwater resources, but also harms the ecology of waterbodies by causing 
50 
eutrophication due to the presence of nutrients suspended in them. Thus, reducing the level of 
51 
dissolved oxygen (DO) in water bodies (Sengupta et al., 2015). 52 
WW contains Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) which are usually lost during WW 
53 
treatment as sludge or discharged after treatment. Recovering and reusing them helps in 
54 
achieving selfreliance and sustainability. Since N and P are critical components for plant 
55 
growth, they are used as raw materials in fertilizer production. P is used as an energy source 
56 
(ADP  adenosine triphosphate), while N is used for building DNA and RNA in plants (Willich 
57 
and Mathews, 2017).
