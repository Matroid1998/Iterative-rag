Description:
Used as a pure supporting electrolyte in electrochemical studies.

In this work, we focus on the stability of
Ptmodified Ru(0001) electrodes with Pt thick
nesses of up to three layers during the electro
oxidation of methanol (MeOH) and CO in acid
at potentials larger than 1.05 V. This potential
had been chosen as upper potential limit in pre
vious studies to prevent possible restructuring
of the electrodes during the experiment.41,51,52
Here, we first studied the stability and struc
tural modifications of an electrode with three
Pt layers in pure supporting H2SO4 electrolyte
and during the MOR by surface Xray diffrac
tion (SXRD) at the synchrotron.
