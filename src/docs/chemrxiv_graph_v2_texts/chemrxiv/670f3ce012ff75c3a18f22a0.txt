Description:
An opioid analgesic that binds to Class A G protein-coupled receptors to produce potent analgesic effects.

Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and codeine, are widely used for their potent analgesic effects 
43 
that are mediated through binding to a class of opioid receptors known as ClassA Gproteincoupled 
44 
receptors (GPCRs).1 However, the clinical use of these analgesics is severely limited by their adverse 
45 
side effects, which include dependency, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and elevated 
46 
tolerance.2 Three main subtypes of opioid receptorsthe opioid receptor (MOR), opioid receptor 
47 
(DOR), and opioid receptor (KOR)have been identified, all of which can elicit analgesic effects 
48 
through Gioproteinmediated signaling upon activation. While most clinically available opioid analgesics 
49 
primarily target the MOR, this receptor subtype is also responsible for the majority of the adverse effects 
50 
associated with opioid therapy.
