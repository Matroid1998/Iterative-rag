Description:
Functionalized lysophosphatidylcholine lipid that undergoes native chemical ligation.

While several 
studies have observed stabilizing effects using mixed membranes (1621 , an intriguing alternative is that chemical 
reactions between simple and abundant molecules could have led to the generation of more complex amphiphilic 
species. In this scenario, a nonenzymatic protometabolism would be required to generate lipid species that would then 
spontaneously assemble to form a closed membranebound protocell. However, to date there are no robust examples 
of chemistries that can lead to well characterized celllike membranes from shortchain precursors. Previously, we had reported that a cysteine (Cys functionalized lysophosphatidylcholine lipid undergoes native 
chemical ligation (NCL with sodium 2mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA thioesters to produce noncanonical 
phospholipids (22, 23 .

Description:
An amino acid that may undergo native chemical ligation in the presence of acyl thioesters.

Interestingly, it was also observed that the remaining thiol group of the diacylated product can 
further react with additional thioesters to generate phospholipids containing three alkyl chains. Inspired by these findings, 
we hypothesized that cysteine itself may undergo NCL in the presence of acyl thioesters followed by substrate reloading, 
leading to the production of diacylcysteine species. Both cysteine and shortchain thioesters have been shown to be 
synthesized by prebiotically plausible routes, and both can be produced in abundance, the latter through derivatization 
of shortchain fatty acids (24, 25 . Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the significance of cysteine in prebiotic 
metabolism, for instance as a catalyst for peptide bond formation (24 .
