Description:
Used in olefin polymerization with metallocene or other single-site catalysts.

Text:
The structure and properties of methylaluminoxane (MAO)1,2 
continue to attract interest in the context of olefin 
polymerization 
using 
metallocene 
or 
other 
singlesite 
catalysts.3,4,5 After nearly 50 years of effort devoted to the study 
of this process, the identity of the reactive components of MAO 
has become clearer.
