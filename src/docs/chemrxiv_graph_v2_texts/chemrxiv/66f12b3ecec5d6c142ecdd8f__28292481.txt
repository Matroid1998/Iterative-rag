Description:
A hydroxycarboxylic acid that can retard the hydration of Portland cement by adsorbing onto the surface of cement particles.

In this study, we are particularly interested in the interaction mechanism of hydroxycarboxylic acids
17
such as citric and tartaric acid. Numerous studies have examined the effects of citric acid and, in some
18
cases, tartaric acid on the hydration of Portland cement 4, 8, 16, 11. The observed retarding effect was
19
explained by the formation of a protective layer around the cement grains through the adsorption of the
20
additives onto the surface of the particles 7, 5, 8. This is supported by other studies reporting that set
21
retarders slow down or inhibit the dissolution of the cement grains 10, 17.
