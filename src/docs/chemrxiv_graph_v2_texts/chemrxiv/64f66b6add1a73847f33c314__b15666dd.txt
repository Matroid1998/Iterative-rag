Description:
When irradiated by above-bandgap ultraviolet light, it creates electron-hole pairs that mediate redox reactions.

Owing to these advantages, photocatalytic AOPs show promise to contribute to the ongoing 
shift toward decentralized wastewater treatment plants, which operate at smaller scale and closer 
to the point of consumption than the urban treatment centers prevalent today.5 Titanium dioxide 
(TiO2) is a widely used semiconductor photocatalyst since it is lowcost, nontoxic, and 
environmentally friendly.4,9 When TiO2 is irradiated by abovebandgap ultraviolet (UV) light, 
electronhole pairs are created. The holes, in turn, mediate redox reactions at the TiO2water 
interface that generate hydroxyl radicals (OH). Optimal photocatalytic performance requires 
maximizing light absorption while simultaneously minimizing the rate at which photogenerated 
electrons and holes recombine.
