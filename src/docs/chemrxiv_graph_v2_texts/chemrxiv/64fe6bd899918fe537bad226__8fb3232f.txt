The main gas causing the greenhouse effect.

However, the goal of limiting global warming to around 2C still requires a peak 
34 
in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 at the latest, as well as a quarter decrease 
35 
in emissions by 20301. As the main gas causing the greenhouse effect, the absorption 
36 
and disposal of carbon dioxide (CO2) has always been an issue of widespread concern. 37 
Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is widely deemed as a key technology 
38 
to reduce CO2 emissions from large industrial facilities. According to the IPCC report, 
39 
modern conventional power plants equipped with CCUS technology can reduce CO2 
40 
emissions to the atmosphere by 80902.
