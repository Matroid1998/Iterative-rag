Description:
Saturated compounds such as pyrrolidine that can undergo conformational restriction.

Text:
Imposing conformational restriction through a bicyclic system is an 
important design methodology in drug discovery that can improve 
the compounds potency, selectivity, physicochemical andor 
metabolic profile, and this approach was implemented successfully 
for numerous bicyclic sultams.7 For the smallest representatives of 
the series, however, the above strategy may represent a considerable 
synthetic challenge. Such rigidification is wellstudied for saturated 
heterocyclic amines (i.e., pyrrolidine) and to a lesser extent  for 
lactams (Figure 1, B). Thus, 2,4methanoproline (1) was isolated 
from natural sources as early as in 1980.8 Since then, numerous 
efficient approaches to the synthesis of 2,4methanopyrrolidines 
were developed.917 Meanwhile, isosteric bridged bicyclic sultam, 
2thia3azabicyclo2.1.1hexane 
2,2dioxide 
(2), 
remained 
unknown to date.
