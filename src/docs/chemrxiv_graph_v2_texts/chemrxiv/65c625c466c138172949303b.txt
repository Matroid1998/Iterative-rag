Description:
Involved in the reversible interconversion with protons facilitated by hydrogenase enzymes.

Text:
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a fundamental process of water 
splitting to produce hydrogen, is an efficient and sustainable way to convert electrical energy 
into chemical energy.1 Naturally occurring enzymes such as hydrogenase, can effectively 
facilitate reversible interconversion of protons and H2.
