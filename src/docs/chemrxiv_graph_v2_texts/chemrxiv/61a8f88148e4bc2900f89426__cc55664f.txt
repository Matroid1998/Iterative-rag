Description:
Forms complexes with bond distances ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 Ã…, exhibiting multicongurational electronic structures.

Text:
Starting with Cottons work in the 1970s, a variety of dichromium com
plexes have been synthesized; characterization by diraction has shown that the bond distances
range from 1.7 to 2.3 .4,1118 Although in the early days formal bond orders were estimated
based on distances, computational work using multicongurational methods has established that
the electronic structure of these complexes is multicongurational due to the small energy splitting
between the , , and  orbitals.

Description:
Complexes that present unique challenges in empirical force constants and bond distances.

Text:
Da Re et al. emphasize the unique challenges in dichromium
complexes by comparing the empirical force constants and bond distances for rst and second
row transition metals. For example, Mo(II)Mo(II) bond distances empirically correlate to their
vibrational frequencies, as expected, with force constants increasing monotonically with decreas
