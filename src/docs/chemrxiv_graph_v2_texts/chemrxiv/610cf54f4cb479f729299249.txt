Description:
Molecular oxygen can be sensitized by an energetic triplet state.

Text:
Furthermore, the accessible triplet state should be 
energetic enough to allow sensitization of the molecular 
oxygen. Obviously, intense absorption in the visible, or even 
near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, 
together with a high bioavailability are also necessary to 
increase the global efficiency. Unfortunately, the last two 
properties are usually conflicting, since redshifting the 
absorption spectrum usually requires the inclusion of large p
conjugated moieties, which in turn diminish solubility in 
aqueous media and biological conditions.
