Description:
Used in electrolysis with anion-exchange membranes for energy conversion.

Text:
Current CO2 electrolysis efforts using the MEA technology demonstrate energy efficiencies of only up to 34 
and operating lifetimes of tens to a few hundred hours, indicating a gap that needs to be addressed.46 

Typically, the MEA (Figure 1A) has a compact design and facilitates efficient transport of reactants. A gas diffusion layer 
(GDL) coated with a catalyst layer allows reactants and products to be transported through the GDL to the active catalyst 
location. Positioned between the two GDLs is an ion exchange membrane that transports ions and water between the

cathode and the anode. In particular, anionexchange membranes (AEMs) are regarded as one of the most promising 
membranes for CO2 electrolysis.
