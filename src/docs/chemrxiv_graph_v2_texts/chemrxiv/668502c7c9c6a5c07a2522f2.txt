Description:
A molecular perovskite with potential ferroelastic, ferroelectric, and multiferroic behavior.

The substitution of atoms by molecules in the structure motifs 
of allinorganic materials is a powerful approach for designing 
new materials. It opens up a large chemical design space for 
studying applicationoriented1 and fundamental2 structure
property relationships, while still allowing the use of established 
principles3 from inorganic solidstate chemistry to guide 
materials discovery. For instance, in coordination polymers that 
crystallise 
in 
an 
AMX3 
perovskite 
motif, 
such 
as 
CH3NH3Mn(N3)34 and C10H20NCd(C2N3)3,5 here referred to as 
molecular perovskites, properties such as ferroelastic,6 
(improper) ferroelectric1,7,8 and multiferroic9,10 behaviour, their 
glassforming 
abilities11,12 
and 
their 
application 
as 
barocalorics13,14 are linked to the molecular nature of the A and 
Xsite.
