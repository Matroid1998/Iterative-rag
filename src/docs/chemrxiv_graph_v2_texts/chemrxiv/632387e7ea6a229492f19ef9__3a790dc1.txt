Description:
Cation is very often lone pair active, leading to complicated coordination environments.

Bismuth is the heaviest stable element of the periodic table (the 
halflife of 209Bi 12  2.0  1019 yr is nine orders of magnitude 
longer than the age of the universe, t  1.4  1010 yr). This prop
erty makes it and its compounds interesting for studying effects 
of strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) on physical properties of 
materials. Relativistic effects often result in Bi compounds be
having differently than isoelectronic species. For example, the 
most common cationic oxidation state of Bi is 3, with 5 com
pounds being generally unstable towards reduction. Bi3 cation 
is very often lonepair active, leading to complicated coordina
tion environments. Less known are the effects of relativistic 
phenomena on structural chemistry of Bi intermetallic com
pounds.
