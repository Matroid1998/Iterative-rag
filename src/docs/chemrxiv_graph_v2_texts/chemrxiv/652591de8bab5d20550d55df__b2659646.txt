Description:
Used in studies to gain insights into the HER mechanism through Nuclear Forward Scattering.

Text:
We suggested that the higher TOF is enabled by a shift in electron density from the iron 
center to one of the nitrogen ligands, forming a structure that facilitates OH bond breaking in the 
adsorbed water molecule.23 
In this work, in situ and operando Nuclear Forward Scattering (NFS) is used to obtain further insights on 
the HER mechanism with an Fe porphyrin. NFS, just like the more widely known Mssbauer spectros
copy (MS), is based on the nuclear resonance effect which is highly sensitive to chemical changes in the 
environment of individual metal sites.
