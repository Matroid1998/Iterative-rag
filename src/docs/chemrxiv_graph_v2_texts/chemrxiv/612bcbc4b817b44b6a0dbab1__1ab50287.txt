Description:
Complexes that can form long-lived excited states, important for efficient photocatalytic activity.

Text:
For the majority of catalysts, 
either organometallic complexes or metalfree chromo
phores, the ability to form longlived excited states has been 
postulated as a prerequisite for the efficient photocatalytic 
activity31, 32. Within this context, we turned our attention to 
the recently reported orthogonal electron donoracceptor 
(DA) boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)based dyads33. In 
these dyads the BODIPY chromophores are usually substi
tuted at the mesoposition with another conjugated dye, 
e. g. anthracene (Ant), so that the planes of BODIPY and the 
dye form an angle close to 90 (Fig. 1a). The dyads possess 
longlived triplet excited states of BODIPY, when selectively 
excited at either BODIPY or the dye unit of the dyad.
