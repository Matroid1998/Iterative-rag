Description:
Used in the computational hydrogen electrode approach for proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.

Text:
For protoncoupled electron transfer reactions (Scheme 1a), the vast 
majority of studies are conducted with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach.15 In 
the case of electrochemical CO2 electroreduction, one can directly calculate the formation of COOH 
via reaction Eq. (1). H(aq)  e  CO2(g)    COOH
(1)
In the CHE approach, the pH and potential dependency of reaction Eq. (1) enters into the chemical 
potential of H(aq)  e, whereas the energy of the COOH species is usually assumed to not depend on 
potential.1618 If the adsorbed COOH species does not change the potential of the interface, 
reaction Eq. (1) is even at constant potential. 2
