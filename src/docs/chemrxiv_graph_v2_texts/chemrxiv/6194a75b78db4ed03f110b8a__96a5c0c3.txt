Description:
Enhances oxygen evolution and reduction reactions due to its multiple oxidation states and role in water oxidation.

Text:
In search for concepts to develop the next generation of
batteries with comparable or even superior performances
than existing devices, zincair batteries (ZABs) belong
to the most promising approaches 13. However, in
spite of the many advantageous features, one of the basic
problems for its use is the slow kinetics of oxygen evo
lution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) on the
air cathodes 1. In recent years, many eorts have been
devoted to solve this problem by nding new electrocat
alysts with suciently high activities to promote both
reactions 2, 49. Manganese and cobalt oxides are natural candidates
to enhance OER and ORR because of their role in the
water oxidation in many biological systems, their multi
ple oxidation states, natural abundance, and inexpensive
costs 6, 1012.

Description:
In bulk oxides, manganese ions usually have tetrahedral or octahedral coordination geometry resulting in a high-spin state.

Text:
In bulk oxides, the coordi
nation geometry of manganese and cobalt ions is usually
tetrahedral (Td) or octahedral (Oh) resulting in highspin
state for both Co2 and Mn2 ions (with magnetic mo
ments MS of 3 and 5 B, respectively). In contrast, for
Co3 three dierent spin states are possible, i.e. lowspin
axel.grossuniulm.de
(MS  0B), highspin (MS  4B), and intermediate
spin (MS  2B). In this case the spin state is very
sensitive to changes in the coordination geometry, e.g.,
CoO length or CoOCo angle. Dierent to the cobalt,
in manganese oxides Mn3 always remains in highspin
state (MS  4B) 18.
