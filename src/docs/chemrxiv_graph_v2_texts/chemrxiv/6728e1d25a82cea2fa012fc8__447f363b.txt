Description:
The sum of 25OHD3 together with minor levels of 25hydroxyvitamin D2.

Text:
Vitamin D3 is metabolized 
in the liver to form 25hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3 or calcifediol), the major circulating form 
of vitamin D, which is mainly bound to the vitamin D binding protein prior to its bioactivation to 
form 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) 8. Vitamin D status is typically assessed based on 
measuring the total circulating concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the sum of 25
OHD3 together with minor levels of 25hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) derived from the dietary
