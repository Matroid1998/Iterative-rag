The probes like (E)4(1H
Indol3ylvinyl)Nmethylpyridine 
iodide 
inhibit 
the 
proliferation of many cancer cell lines, limiting their 
application in biological studies. Rhodamine and TPP are 
extensively used to target mitochondria due to their low 
cytotoxicity.9 However, TPP being a bulky group may affect 
the sensitivity of the probe towards viscosity, and aggregation
caused quenching effect can also interfere with monitoring the 
viscosity in the biological milieu.12,23,24 Therefore, there is a 
need for developing discerning probes to account for 
mitochondria viscosity that can monitor the proper functioning 
of the mitochondria in cellular homeostasis. Moreover, cellular homeostasis regulates and maintains the 
vital internal variables in a state of constancy. The cell mem
brane provides the barrier for the internal workings of the cell 
from its external environment.
