Description:
A target molecule for capture in high-performance membranes due to its selectivity and permeance.

Text:
Highperformance membranes have immense potential to improve carbon capture efficiency1,2 if 
they can be designed to yield a high CO2 selectivity and a high CO2 permeance.3 Nanoporous 
atomically thin membranes (NATM), particularly porous graphene, have attracted substantial 
attention.49 A single translocation event across the zerodimensional pore determines selective 
transport.1012 Attractive gas separation performance has been observed,7,1319 with selectivity 
arising from relative mass,8,20 molecular size,15,2128 and binding affinity16,19,29,30 differences. An 
accurate prediction of capture performance from graphene pores is needed to highlight the true 
potential of NATM. This will help design improved membranes for carbon capture. Accurate and rapid computation of capture performance from realistic CO2selective pores, 
mimicking those formed in experiments, is needed.
