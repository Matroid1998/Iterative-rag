Description:
Doped in carbon-based catalysts to enhance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in fuel cells.

Text:
Considering the global need to move from fossil fuels to re
newable sources of energy, fuel cell chemistry and in particular
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are highly active fields
of research.14 Iron and nitrogen doped carbonbased (FeNC)
catalysts show high ORR activity and have thus emerged as a
promising alternative to platinumbased catalysts in fuel cells.

Description:
A single iron ion is coordinated via four nitrogen donors and embedded into a carbon matrix.

Text:
Due to a pyrolysis step in their preparation, FeNC catalysts are
amorphous materials with different iron phases, which ham
pers the structural and electronic decipherment of the active
site.58 Previous experimental and theoretical studies have de
duced that the ORR is driven by FeN4 sites, where a single
iron ion is coordinated via four nitrogen donors and embed
ded into a carbon matrix.913 However, their exact nature in
terms of geometry beyond the FeN4coordination and elec
tronic structure remains unclear.

Description:
In FeNC catalysts, iron coordination environment is studied using MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy to determine oxidation state, spin state, and electron density distribution.

For instance, FeN4 centres
where N is bound in fivemembered rings (pyrrolic, often de
noted as FeN4C12) or in sixmembered rings (pyridinic, often
denoted as FeN4C10) are discussed.14,15 Many quantum chem
ical studies have developed models that seek to describe active
sites and their reaction mechanisms.12,13,1625 Recent quan
tum chemical work coupled to in situ and operando Mssbauer
spectroscopy studies on different FeNC preparations has shown
that pyrrolic FeNC sites form a thermodynamically and spectro
scopically consistent active site,12,13 in agreement with more
recent works.14
Mssbauer spectroscopy provides insights into the iron co
ordination environment, specifically the oxidation state, spin
state and more subtle details concerning the asymmetry of the
electron density distribution.17,2630 In studies of FeNC cata
lysts, Mssbauer spectroscopy is used to elucidate different iron
phases in FeNC catalysts as well as the changes of characteris
tic signatures under in situ and operando conditions.8,12,13,31
Synthetically, FeN4 sites are easily accessible in small molecu
lar complexes such as porphyrin,3235 phthalocyanine3638 or
phenantroline3840 ligand spheres, which lack the extended 
system expected to be present in the carbon matrix of FeNC ma
terials.10,11,17 The interpretation of Mssbauer data on FeNC
catalysts therefore relies on comparisons with such model com
plexes, or, more recently, on the comparison to predicted data
from quantum chemical calculations where the extended  sys
tem can be included in the model.12,13,15,17,19,20 With a novel
preparation strategy using active site imprinting and trans
metalation, MNC catalysts with minimal inorganic side phases
were produced.4144 This results in materials with structurally
better defined MN4 sites, e.g.

ZnNC systems with a preference
for pyrrolic sites, which are subjected to transmetalation with
iron and subsequent heatactivation.45 It is reported that the
structure of the MN4 environment is conserved to a significant
degree and that the formation of elemental iron or iron carbide
side phases is avoided.41,42,45,46

representative active site models for such FeN4 materials in

type of nitrogen donor, a wide array of different active site
models can be constructed and evaluated computationally. Since the introduction of a fivemembered ring necessitates
the incorporation of an accompanying defect, e.g.
