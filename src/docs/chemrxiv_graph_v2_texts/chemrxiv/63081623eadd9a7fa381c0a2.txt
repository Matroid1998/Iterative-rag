Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to the carbon footprint of desalination processes.

Text:
Global population growth and economic development have led to rising water demands, which 
when coupled with dwindling freshwater reserves due to climate change, is exacerbating water 
scarcity.1,2 Projections indicate that over half the global population will experience severe water 
stress by the end of this decade, thus necessitating the use of desalination technologies to close the 
gap between water demand and supply.3,4 Although desalination has the potential to provide more 
reliable and climateindependent freshwater, its broader adoption is limited by the large energy 
footprint and associated treatment cost.5 Specifically, energy alone accounts for 3050 of the 
total water cost, which is currently dominated by fossil fueldriven purification of seawater.6,7 This 
carbon footprint is expected to become significant (110 kg CO2 per cubic meter of freshwater 
produced) as the global desalination capacity increases to 200 million m3day by the end of this 
decade, thus suggesting a critical need to decarbonize water treatment and produce clean water 
sustainably.810 In this context, the overlap between regions with water stress and a good solar 
resource makes solar desalination an attractive technology option,11 as shown in Figure 1.
