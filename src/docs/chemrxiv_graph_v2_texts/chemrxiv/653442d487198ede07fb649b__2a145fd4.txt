Description:
A functional group endcapping telechelic PE building blocks in polymerization.

Text:
We reasoned that an effective and scalable approach should be an innovative dropin 
process based on the widely practiced coordination (co)polymerization of ethylene and 
olefins in the current plastics industry28.To realize this strategy, we first synthesize ABtype 
telechelic PE building blocks endcapped with alcohol (OH) functionality (A) at one end and 
ester (CO2Et) functionality (B) at the other by coordinative chaintransfer polymerization 
(CCTP) of ethylene and 1octene with suitable chaintransfer and chainend capping reagents. We further hypothesized that the advantage of AB telechelic building blocks over A2  B2 ones 
in polycondensation, especially concerning precise stoichiometric control, should allow for 
LEGOtype modular assembly of AB building blocks into ondemand PE materials.
