Description:
Forms concentration gradients in spheroids, similar to tumors, affecting cellular function and metabolism.

While 2D cell cultures have minimal cellcell contacts and a 
homogenous phenotype, the multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) is an example of a 3D cell culture that 
provides a platform for examining cellular function and metabolism in cancer.3, 4 Nutrient and oxygen 
concentration gradients are formed in spheroids, much like tumors, and consist of proliferating cells in the 
outer layers and hypoxic, nutrientdeprived necrotic cells in the inner regions.5, 6 In between these vastly 
different cell populations, viable quiescent cells are also present.6 
Studies on the altered lipid metabolism of colorectal cancers show that to be a promising and 
targetable vulnerability.7 Mass spectrometrybased lipidomic studies on colorectal cancer have taken a 
number of approaches to understand lipidomic alteration better as it relates to different cell lines, the 
effect of coculturing of different cell lines, or comparing patient tumor and adjacent normal tissues.
