Description:
Used to study the deformation of polymers through mechanically induced ring opening of spiropyrans.

Text:
Mechanically induced 
ring opening of SPs have been previously applied to study the deformation of various polymers, 
including PDMS,2 PMA3 and glassy PMMA4, and polycarbonates5, among other 
examples.6 Almost universally, SPMC isomerization allow for tracking the extent of bond 
scission upon application of external force or identical phenomena induced by physical 
swelling7 of polymer networks in the absence of external stresses. While the latter two are 
common types of extrinsic stresses known to bias mechanophore behaviour,8 this work aims 
at investigating the stresses that are intrinsic and common for the majority of polymers in their 
solid state  internal or residual stresses. Figure 1. Photoinduced and thermal isomerization of spiropyran. (A) Photoinduced, reversible
