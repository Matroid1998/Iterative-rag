Description:
Involves a competition of entropic and enthalpic driving forces in its solvation structure.

Furthermore, the structural
predictions of MQC simulations of e
aq can depend quite
sensitively on the pseudopotential,8,9,11,12 which one of
us found recently to arise from a competition of entropic
and enthalpic driving forces in the solvation structure of
e
aq.13
A rstprinciples description of e
aq is thus preferred,
and several ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) strate
gies have emerged recently, including Quantum Mechan
icsMolecular Mechanics (QMMM),14,15 periodic plane
wave Density Functional Theory (DFT),16,17 periodic
secondorder MollerPlesset theory (MP2),18 and Path
Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) with Machine
Learned (ML) potentials.19
Given the computational cost of ab initio methods, ex
plorations of the equilibrium dynamics of e
aq have so far
been limited, although the initial localization dynamics
has received attention.14,16,18,20 An exception is the very
recent PIMD study of e
aq with ML potentials, which af
forded extensive sampling due to the forceeldlike cost
of ML potentials.19 Of the AIMD methods, QMMM is
particularly ecient, since most of the solvent molecules
far from the electron can be treated with a cheap MM
forceeld, and only the rst few solvent shells around
e
aq need to be treated at a QM level.
