Description:
Structures where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchanges are influenced by the bridging oxygen atoms and their angles.

Text:
The only clearcut case is when all 
bridges are 23N3 ions which promote ferromagnetic exchange for both Jcr and Jrr.30 Based on magneto
structural correlations developed for Ni4O4 cubanes,2 one might expect Jcr to be ferromagnetic and Jrr 
antiferromagnetic in all Obridged species given that the former are mediated by 3O atoms with 
smaller NiONi angles than the latter, which are bridged by 2O atoms. Indeed, this is what is observed 
in a AlIII2NiII5 Anderson wheel reported recently, where Jcr  10 cm1 and Jrr  5 cm1 (
