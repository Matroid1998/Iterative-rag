Induces palladium-catalyzed selective C-H amination.

of 
bonds or functionalities have been a matter of extensive investigation for the last couple 
of decades. We have come across a substrate namely, 5benzoylpyrrolo2,1
aisoquinoline in which three different functionalizable CH bonds were identified that 
could be judiciously transformed site selectively for the generation of complex polyring 
fused Nheterocycles. At first, we attempted a Pdcatalyzed crossdehydrogenative 
coupling in 5benzoylpyrrolo2,1aisoquinoline towards the synthesis of 8Hindeno
pyrrolo2,1aisoquinolinones. Later, we identified a hitherto unknown oxygen induced 
palladium catalyzed selective CH amination in 5benzoylpyrrolo2,1aisoquinoline 
towards a pentacene viz., 9Hindolopyrrolo2,1aisoquinoline. Finally, we came across 
an unexpected site selective CH amination towards the formation of multiring fused 
benzazepine which is believed to form due to its stability and to the higher electron density 
at the reaction centre on isoquinoline ring.
