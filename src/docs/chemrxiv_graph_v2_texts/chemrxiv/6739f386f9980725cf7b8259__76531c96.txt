Description:
Bioactive compounds abundant in nature, often containing heterocyclic structures.

The methods for construction of quinolin2ones 1 and indole 2 ring systems are of utmost 
importance for the synthetic organic chemistry, as both classes of heterocycles are vastly abundant in 
nature, with many examples of highly bioactive alkaloids 3, 4, 5. The ring closure of oxocarbenium 
intermediates via intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution is an approach applicable to the 
construction of both quinolin2ones and indoles. In the former case this approach is known as the 
Knorr synthesis 6 and it has found numerous applications in the preparation of various quinolin2
one derivatives from ketoanilides 7, 8. The mechanism of this reaction has been studied in detail 
and it has been shown to proceed via distonic superelectrophilic dications 9.
