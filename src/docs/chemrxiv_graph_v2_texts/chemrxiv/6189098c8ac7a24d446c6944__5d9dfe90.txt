Description:
Metal cations transferred from an acidic aqueous phase.

Text:
The transfer of actinide metal cations
occurs from an acidic aqueous phase resulting from the dissolution of the fuel in nitric acid
into an organic phase by complexation with liposoluble extracting molecules.2 Nowadays,
the main industrial solvent extraction process is Plutonium Uranium Rening by Extraction
(PUREX), in which the trinbutyl phosphate (TBP) extracting agent is used to separate
U(VI) and Pu(IV) from minor actinides and ssion products in highly concentrated nitric
acid solution.3 Although ecient, the PUREX process requires a reduction of plutonium for
