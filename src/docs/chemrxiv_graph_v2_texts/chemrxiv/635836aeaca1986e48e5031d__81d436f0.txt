Description:
Can serve as a weakly bound fourth ligand in the CuA site.

Text:
The biological CuA site is a binuclear copper center that has been found in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and nitrous oxide reductase (NOR) where it 
functions as a highly efficient electron transfer (ET) site, similar to the mononuclear type 1 copper centers in other proteins.1 Each Cu ion in the 
CuA site is ligated by one histidine and by two bridging thiolateS from two cysteine residues, forming an almost trigonal planar coordination 
geometry. This is complemented by a weakly bound fourth ligand in axial position, either a methionineS or a backbone carbonyl group of a glutamate
