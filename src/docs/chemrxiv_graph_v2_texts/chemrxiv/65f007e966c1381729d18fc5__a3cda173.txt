Global efforts to electrify transportation and provide grid level energy storage have driven de
mand for new battery technologies with improved safety, power density, and energy density1,2. One promising strategy is the development of solidstate batteries (SSBs) which potentially offer
improved safety characteristics3,4 and greater compatibility with energydense negative electrode
materials such as Li metal5,6 compared to conventional batteries utilizing liquid electrolytes. Amongst solid electrolyte (SE) chemistries, doped cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has garnered sig
nificant attention as a separator material due to its high bulk ionic conductivity and minimal
chemical reactivity with Li metal710. Despite this apparent stability in contact with Li metal,
LLZO suffers from other surface reactions under common processing conditions.
