Description:
A surfactant that can self-assemble under high ionic strength conditions.

Text:
However,
even
relatively
simple
surfactants,
such
as
sodium
dodecylsulfate, can under certain conditions (that is, high
ionic strength) selfassemble in ways that take the concept
of packing parameter to its limit. 6
Implicit in the idea of the packing parameter is the
assumption
of
sequestration
of
the
hydrophobic
and
hydrophilic moieties of each amphiphile into two spatially
welldefined regions, the first being a buried part (the
socalled core), protected from the solvent by the second
one (shell). The existence of coreshell structures has
indeed been shown in numerous experiments, prominently
using smallangle scattering (SAS). 79 Assemblies do not
need to be spherically symmetric, but depending on the
detailed balance of the coreshell contributions to the free
energy, organizations with ellipsoidal, cylindrical, or even
lamellarvesicular shapes may also form.
