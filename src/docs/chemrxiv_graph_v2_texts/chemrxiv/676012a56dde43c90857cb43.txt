Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier with multiple applications ranging from energy 
generation to feedstock for chemical industries.14 The use of hydrogen is expected to greatly 
contribute to the decarbonisation of different sectors such as heavy industry and mobility 
where carbon emissions are hard to abate. 5, 6 Hydrogen can be produced with very low carbon 
emissions by the combination of renewable energy sources and water electrolysis, 7, 8 which 
can further address challenges associated with the intermittent nature of renewables like solar 
and wind via storage.

Description:
Often required at elevated pressures for storage and transportation.

PEMWE is one of the most promising technologies offering the 
advantage of high current density operation, high degree of gas purity, compact design, high 
energy efficiency7, 12, 13 and possibility of pressurised operation.14 Pressurised PEMWE is 
gaining considerable interest, since hydrogen is often required at elevated pressures for 
storage, transportation15 and other end uses.16, 17 Internal pressurisation of electrolysis gas 
has several advantages such as elimination of membrane dehydration resulting into the 
preservation of the integrity of the catalyst layer,18, 19 reduced gas drying costs, 18 and, most 
importantly, reduction or even elimination of downstream gas compression costs.15, 18, 20, 21 
Highpressure PEMWE experimental studies have been reported at pressures up to 70 bar,22 
155 bar,23 100  113 bar,4, 15, 24 and 180 bar,25 with a highest reported hydrogen output pressure 
of 700 bar.26
