Description:
A biodegradable polyester used for nanoparticle preparation.

Text:
There is an extensive library of biodegradable polymers available for NPs preparation 
whereas the vast majority belong to the family of polyesters, including poly(lactide) (PLA), 
poly(caprolactone)(PCL), poly(trimethylenecarbonate) (PTMC), etc. 9,10. Block 
copolyesters are also known as drug carriers since copolymerization is a very beneficial tool 
that can remarkably change the material hydrophilicity. In this context, copolymers of PLA 
with glycolic acid (i.e., poly(lacticcoglycolic acid), PLGA) were probably the most widely 
explored and they are already commercially available 1114. However, despite their 
indisputable advantages, PLA and PLGAbased drug delivery systems also face a number of 
challenges such as initial burst release, incomplete drug dissolution, and enhanced lag time 
13,14. Considering those facts, new types of biodegradable polyesters need to be proposed to 
overcome these limitations.
