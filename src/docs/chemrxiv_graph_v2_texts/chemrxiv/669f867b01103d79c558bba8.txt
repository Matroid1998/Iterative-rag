Description:
A molecular component essential for normal physiological conditions.

Hypoxia is a condition occurring in several disorders resulting in lower levels (15) of molecular oxygen 
(O2) compared to the normoxic conditions of healthy physiological environment, where the O2 tension 
is typically between 10 and 21.1 This status is mainly induced by the poor vascularization or impaired 
blood flow characterizing potentially fatal illnesses like solid tumors,2,3 microbial4 and fungal5 
infections and biofilms, cerebral6 and myocardial7 ischemia, etc. The harshness of hypoxia resides 
in its ability to annihilate the efficacy of current drugbased therapies as it boosts drug resistance4 and 
to reduce the effects of radiotherapy8 and photodynamic therapy (PDT)9 as well.

Description:
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is photochemically generated in situ upon irradiation of the reaction mixture.

Text:
The addition to polycyclic aromatic precursors of singlet oxygen (1O2) photochemically generated in situ 
upon irradiation of the reaction mixture containing a substoichiometric amount of a photosensitizer 
(PS), is a most efficient way to form EPOs.10 This photooxygenation reaction is straightforward and 
typically results in final products bearing the target intramolecular OO bridge. Selection and positioning 
of the substituents on the aromatic cores are crucial for the overall ability to selectively bind and release 
O2.
