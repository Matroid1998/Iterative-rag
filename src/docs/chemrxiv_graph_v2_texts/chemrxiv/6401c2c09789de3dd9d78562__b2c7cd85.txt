Description:
A p-type semiconductor used as an effective hole collector.

Text:
Either conventional 26, 27 or ionic carbon nitride 29, 30 films were directly deposited onto 
conductive substrates, or PCN was deposited onto porous metal oxide (e.g., TiO2 or ITO) films 
acting as a scaffold and an effective ntype electron collector 11, 12, 3136. In a similar vein, 
PCNbased photocathodes have been fabricated either as pristine 37 or biopolymeractivated 
films,38 or in combination with ptype semiconductors (e.g., CuGaSe2 39, CuI 40 or NiO 
41, 42) acting as effective hole collectors.
