A narrow gap semiconductor with a high surface to volume ratio, ideal for multifunctional applications.

Text:
Puckered structures are a special set of 2D materials
that provide a unique structural basis for accessing novel
mechanical and electronic properties and functions. One
of these is lowdimensional black phosphorus, or phos
phorene. Phosphorene is a narrow gap semiconductor,
and its high surface to volume or mass ratio makes it an
ideal candidate for multifunctional applications 1. It
has drawn wide attention in biomedical applications 2
5, electronics 69, plasmonics 10, photonics 11, 12,
and linear polarizers 9.

Description:
Exhibits anisotropic carrier mobility and thermal conductivity.

Text:
As studied across a multitude
theoretical and experimental research studies, phospho
rene also exhibits several unique material properties that
include anisotropic carrier mobility 13, anisotropic ther
mal conductivity 14, thicknessdependent chargecarrier
mobility 7, anisotropic polarization and optical proper
ties 9, 15, tunable and direct bandgap 16, and strain
induced semiconductormetal transition for uniaxial com
pression normal to the plane 8. Despite its emerging popularity in research and vast
applications, it remains a challenge to understand how
phosphorene behaves when deformed along an arbitrary
direction, which would allow for understanding in how
phosphorenes properties may be adjusted for increased
applications. Due to its orthorhombic structure, phos
phorene likely exhibits strong anisotropy under strain
application.

A material investigated for its structural, mechanical, and electronic behavior under symmetry-breaking deformation.

Text:
In this paper, we investigate the structural,
mechanical, and electronic behavior of the lattice under
symmetrybreaking deformation. We answer two specific
questions (i) How does uniaxial deformation at differ
ent angles affect the phosphorenes mechanical properties
differently? (ii) What are unexpected properties of phos

new electronic devices with unprecedented electronic and
optical functions under extreme loading conditions.

Description:
Exhibits mechanical, orbital, and electrical anisotropy.

Text:
Our results suggest that the lattice possesses an unique
structural change for loading along the zigzag direction
beyond 24 uniaxial strain, the atomic structure un
dergoes an orthogonal reorientation such that the crys
tal structure becomes armchair along the loading direc
tion, resulting in an abnormal decrease in material stress
despite tensile strain application. In the remainder of
the paper, we elaborate on computational details, ana
lyze the reorientations reasons and associated changes in
properties, and discuss the observed mechanical, orbital,
and electrical anisotropy of phosphorene. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023bk0lr ORCID httpsorcid.org000900073989344X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
