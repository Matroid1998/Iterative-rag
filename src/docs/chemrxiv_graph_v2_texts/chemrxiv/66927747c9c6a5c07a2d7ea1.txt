Description:
Used as a reference potential in the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

The key is to identify the reaction
pathway that alters the chemistry, whether it is a decou
pled electron transfer (ET) and proton transfer (PT) or
a coupled (simultaneous) protonelectron transfer (PET)
15, 16. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is one of the most widely
used techniques for characterizing redoxactive systems

1720. This involves applying a potential to an elec
trode relative to a fixed reference potential, such as the
standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) 21. The potential
varies linearly over time within the electrochemical po
tential window of the electrolyte. As an indicator of the
number of electrons transferred, the current is measured
simultaneously. Therefore, it is possible to determine the
number of oxidation states and their stability, reaction
rates, redox potentials, and concentrations of redoxactive
species 22.

Description:
Used as a computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) in simulating electrochemical environments.

Text:
In the prediction of a combined redox and
acidbase reaction, three potential mechanisms, ET, PT,
and PET, are systematically diagrammed along the sides
and diagonal of a square, forming a representation known
as an electrochemical scheme of square 2628. This di
agram effectively elucidates the mechanistic pathways
and redox potentials for multielectron and multiproton
transfer reactions as functions of the applied electrode
potential and the electrolyte pH. Density functional theory (DFT) approach 29, 30 in
combination with implicit solvation models 31 and a
computational standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) 32
are frequently used to simulate electrochemical environ
ments.
