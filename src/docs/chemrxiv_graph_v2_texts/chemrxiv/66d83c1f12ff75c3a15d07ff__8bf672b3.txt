Description:
A system studied for decreased PEO crystallinity and enhanced ionic conductivity.

Text:
investigated the impact of C3mpyrTFSI ionic liquid on the ionic 
conductivity of PEObased ternary polymer electrolytes, and demonstrated that the inclusion 
of highly conductive room temperature ILs significantly enhances ionic conductivity, 
surpassing the limits previous observed in ILfree electrolytes.12 Crosslinking, as a versatile 
polymerization technique, is often used to improve the mechanical property and hinder polymer 
crystallization of plasticized SPEs.10,13 Watanabe et al. first studied the crosslinked PEO
LiClO4 systems which showed decreased PEO crystallinity by decreasing Tg from 22 to 30C 
and enhanced ionic conductivity from 109 to 105 S cm1 at 30C compared to linear PEO 
system (EOLi mole ratio  20).14 Joost et al.
