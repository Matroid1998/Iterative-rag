Description:
Forms additional hydrogen bonds in mutant F12Y compared to HheC wild type.

In this 
regard, our indepth characterization revealed HheC F12Y to be enhanced considerably and towards multiple 
parameters. Complementary molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations highlighted the 
formation of additional hydrogen bonds in mutant F12Y compared to HheC wild type, resulting in a better 
preorganization of the active site and a lower activation barrier for the epoxide ringopening reaction. In addition, a
