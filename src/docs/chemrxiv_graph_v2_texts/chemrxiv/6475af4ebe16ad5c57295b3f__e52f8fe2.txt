Silicon, found mostly as silica (SiO2) or silicates (e. g. Si2O3
2) 
comprising more than 40 of the earths crust serve as primary 
sources for several multibillion dollar industries including the 
silicone polymers, photovoltaics, and the electronics (semicon
ductors). The use of SiO2 as a chemical raw material has relied, 
to date, exclusively on the equipment, capital and energy
intensive carbothermal reduction of quartz carried out at 1900 
 C in arc furnaces affording metallurgical grade silicon (SiMG, ca. 98  purity) 1. The process requires around 1011 kWh to 
produce one kilogram of SiMG 2, with electricity accounting for 
40 of the total production cost 3.

Description:
A key component in photovoltaic cells and semiconductors, with significant demand in the solar industry.

Text:
In 2022 more than 3 million tons of SiMG were produced while 
demand was substantially higher (3.53.75 million tonnes) lead
ing to 300 price increases to 6,0009,000t from 2,000
3,000t in 2021 3. Alone, China in 202021 accounted for 80 
of the 3 million tyr annual production, followed by Europe and 
the Americas. Nearly half (45) of the total demand originates 
from aluminum alloys, 35 from silicones, 15 from photo
voltaic cells, and 5 from the semiconductor industry 3. Driv
en by increasing demand for silicon from the solar photovoltaic 
industry, the market for SiPV has nearly doubled from 1.8 million 
tyr in 2010 4.
