Description:
Sophisticated polymacrocyclic systems incorporating structures like TREN.

Among this class of ligands, 
tris(2aminoethyl)amine) (TREN) represents a classical structure1 that has also been 
incorporated into more sophisticated polymacrocyclic systems, such as cryptands.2 Over the 
past decades, we have developed a family of coneshaped ligands based on the calix6arene 
core, designed to serve as biomimetic models of metalloenzymes, wherein the metal centre is 
confined at the small rim of the calixarene conical cavity (funnel complexes).3 In particular, 
ZnII and CuIII complexes of a calix6arenebased ligand capped with a TREN unit, referred to 
as CalixTRENMe (Scheme 1), have been reported.4 Guestligand exchange were explored in 
depth by NMR spectroscopy with the ZnII complex, while CuIII complexes were studied for the 
detection of amines in water5 and as redox centres for O2 activation.6 More recently, we 
demonstrated that the selective removal of the methyl groups from the three anisole moieties of 
the CalixTRENMe ligand, yielding the CalixTRENH ligand7 (Scheme 1), significantly alters 
the coordination properties of ZnII in the corresponding funnel complexes.8 For instance, while 
the parent ZnIICalixTRENMe complex appears reluctant to bind anionic guests, the ZnIICalix
TRENH complex, featuring phenol groups as a second coordination sphere, displays affinity 
for anions.
