Description:
A fuel used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

Text:
The operating temperature of different fuel cell types 
tends to depend on the nature of the electrolyte being used and is also reflected in the applications of 
various fuel cell types. SOFCs, in particular, have attracted much attention in recent times. This increased interest in SOFCs 
stems from the fact that SOFCs have many advantages over other types of fuel cells. The flexibility of 
fuel, which allows the use of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and other hydrocarbons to power the 
cells is certainly a primary one.

Description:
A potential energy source for a hydrogen-based economy with low emissions.

Text:
Further benefits include higher efficiency, a step towards a hydrogen
based economy, low emissions, relatively low cost and scalability, which allows the stacking of a 
required number of individual cells in series depending on the amounts of power needed in a particular
