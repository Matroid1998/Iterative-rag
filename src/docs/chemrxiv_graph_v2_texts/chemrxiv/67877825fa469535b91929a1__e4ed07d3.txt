Description:
Serve as organocatalysts with high catalytic activity in ring-opening polymerization.

Text:
Over the past two decades, the field of organocatalytic ringopening polymerization (ROP) has 
experienced significant growth.16 The unique advantages of organocatalystsincluding ease of 
removal, enhanced accessibility, modular design, and improved sustainability compared to transition
metalbased systemshave fueled significant progress, particularly in the synthesis of biomedical and 
microelectronic materials.79 Since the groundbreaking work by Hedrick and Waymouth on the 4
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)catalyzed ringopening polymerization of lactide,10 a wide variety of 
organocatalysts have been developed, such as (thio)ureas, amines, carbenes, and phosphazenes.1119 
These catalysts have demonstrated high catalytic activity, stereoselectivity, and precise control over 
molecular weight and architecture in ROP.
