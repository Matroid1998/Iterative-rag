Description:
Used in a CuBr2-Selectfluor manifold for Ritter-type CH functionalization of menthol.

Selectfluor (1(chloromethyl)4fluoro1,4
diazoniabicyclo2.2.2octane bis(tetrafluoroborate)) 
was developed by Banks and Sharif at the University 
of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology as 
a crystalline, airstable source of F, has been 
commercialized by Air Products, and is now 
inexpensive and widely available.1, 2 Soon after its 
discovery, chemists came to appreciate that not only 
was Selectfluor a manageable source of electrophilic 
fluorine3, 4 but also that it was a remarkable oxidant, 
at once strong enough to trigger a variety of 
interesting reactions but mild enough to be 
compatible with a range of functional groups.58 One 
particularly interesting application of Selectfluor as an oxidant has been in its use for siteselective sp3 C
H functionalization reactions,930 an area of longstanding interest to us.3135 We were particularly attracted 
to the early work of Banks36 and later improvement by Baran37 on a Rittertype CH functionalization of 
menthol using a CuBr2Selectfluor manifold (Scheme 1A).

Description:
Used in the treatment of 4methyl1pentanol in an attempt to form 2,2 dimethyltetrahydrofuran.

Text:
At the outset of this project, it was our intention to adapt Barans protocol for an intramolecular C 
 H etherification, and we chose 4methyl1pentanol as a convenient optimization substrate. When 4
methyl1pentanol was treated with CuBr2, Zn(OTf)2, and Selectfluor, none of the desired 2,2
dimethyltetrahydrofuran formed. A very polar spot was visualized by thinlayer chromatography, and the 
crude sample had the acrid odor of a carboxylic acid. 1H NMR analysis confirmed that 4methylvaleric acid 
was the predominant product, an interesting surprise. Mild protocols for the direct oxidation of alcohols to 
carboxylic acids are especially valuable3842; generally twopot reactions are employed, with aldehydes
