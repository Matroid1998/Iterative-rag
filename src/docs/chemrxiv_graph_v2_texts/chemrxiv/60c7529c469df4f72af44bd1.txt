Description:
An atomic perovskite that drives piezo and ferroelectricity through second-order Jahn-Teller distortions or stereoactive lone pairs.

Molecular perovskites, perovskites of composition AMX3 where
at least one of A, M or X is molecular, have additional degrees of
freedom which can produce orderings impossible in atomic per
ovskites.1 These new orderings provide novel routes for materi
als to respond to external stimuli. One area of particular interest
is using the molecular components to create electrical polarisa
tion, without the need for the secondorder JahnTeller distortions
or stereoactive lone pairs that drive piezo and ferroelectricity in
atomic perovskites, e.g. BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr, Ti)O3.2 Molecular per
ovskites now possess polarisations and transition temperatures
which approach those of inorganic perovskites.3 However, their
polarity is typically produced by the orientational order of po
lar Asite cations.4 The functionality often bestowed by the MX3
framework, e.g.
