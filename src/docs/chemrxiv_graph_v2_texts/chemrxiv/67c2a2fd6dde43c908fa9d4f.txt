Description:
Used to introduce specific supramolecular binding sites into porous skeletons.

Among the reported macrocy
clic POPs, conventional macrocyclic compounds, includ
ing cyclodextrin,14 crown ether,11 calix4arene15 and 
pillararene,16 are widely used toward introducing specific 
supramolecular binding sites into the porous skeleton. The wellestablished hostguest interaction for these host 
molecules have been well transplanted into the macrocy
clic POPs. In order to endow taskspecific functions be
yond supramolecular chemistry, functional macrocycles, 
like porphyrin,17,18 aryleneethynylene macrocycles,19,20 
cyclotriveratrylene,21 and others,22 are also leveraged to 
introduce electronicactive or catalytic sites into the func
tional macrocyclic POPs. Recently, chiral POPs, including chiral covalent organic 
frameworks (COFs),23,24 have gained increasing atten
tions due to their unique application in enantioselective 
sensing,11,25 enantioseparation2628 and asymmetric or
ganocatalysis2931.
