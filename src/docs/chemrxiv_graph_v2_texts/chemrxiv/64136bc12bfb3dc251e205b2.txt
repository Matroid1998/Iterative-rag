Description:
A metal ion necessary for the transport and storage of small molecules in haemoglobin.

Text:
Metalloproteins are proteins that contain at least one metal incorporated into their 
structure, the metal being necessary to perform their function properly 1. They are 
abundant in natural systems and their metal ions have a wide range of functions, such as 
transport and storage of small molecules (e.g., haemoglobin harbouring an Fe2 centre), 
stabilisation of protein structure (Zn2 structural sites in zinc fingers), signalling (Ca2 
channels in signal transduction), and catalysis. 2,3 Metalloproteins involved in catalytic 
transformations are called metalloenzymes.
