Relentless exhaustion of nonrenewable resources in combination with everrising
environmental concerns demand escalating eorts to develop and improve clean
energy technology 1, 2, 3. As one of the leading candidates for clean energy
applications, especially in the automotive sector, polymer electrolyte membrane
5
fuel cells (PEMFCs) demonstrate remarkable technical characteristics such as
high power density, high energy conversion eciency, instant startupshut
down and zeroemission operation 4, 5, 6. Despite numerous advantages,
PEMFC technology suers from a signicant drawback in terms of high costs
and insucient performance of the catalyst layer (CL). The latter is fabricated
10
using expensive Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs), which are supported on a
highsurface area carbon material (PtC) 7, 8.
