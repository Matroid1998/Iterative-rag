Description:
A 20-membered ring structure found in zampanolide.

1) is a marine macrolide that was first isolated in 1996 by Tanaka and 
Higa from the marine sponge Fasciospongia rimosa collected at cape Zampa off the coast of 
Okinawa, Japan.1 It features a bicyclic core structure including a 20membered macrolactone 
ring, which carries an unusually stable linear Nacyl hemiaminalcontaining side chain.1 ()
Zampanolide (1) is a potent microtubulestabilizing agent (MSA) and it inhibits the growth of 
human cancer cells with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (210 nM).2 The antiproliferative 
effect of 1 is thus based on the same mechanism of action that characterizes the clinical cancer 
drugs taxol, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, or ixabepilone.3 However, in contrast to the latter, 1 binds to 
tubulin covalently; attachment to the protein involves 1,4addition of the His229 side chain to 
C(9) of the enone moiety in the macrocycle.45 The relative and absolute configuration of 1 was 
established in early synthetic work by Smith and coworkers on ()zampanolide (ent1) in 2001,6 
which over the years was followed by several total syntheses of the natural product 1.79 Synthetic 
work has also been expended on a variety of analogs of 1 in the context of structureactivity 
relationship (SAR) studies.
