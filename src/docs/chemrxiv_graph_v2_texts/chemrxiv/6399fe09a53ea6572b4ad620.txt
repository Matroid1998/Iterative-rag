Description:
Useful electrophiles targeting multiple nucleophilic amino acid residues.

Text:
The impact of cysteinetargeting covalent modifiers has spurred interest in the development of complementary 
beyondcysteine approaches to target additional amino acid residues and thus expand applicability across the 
proteome (Fig. 1a).15 Sulfur(VI) fluorides (SFs), have emerged as useful electrophiles for this application, 
targeting multiple nucleophilic amino acid residues, including lysine,6 tyrosine,7 and serine.8 The prevalence 
of these residues in almost all protein pockets makes SFs promising functional groups for the development of 
covalent inhibitors for proteins, and expansion of the liganded proteome.916 Recently, several SFcontaining 
modulators have been reported, which enabled covalent modification of protein pockets without targeting a 
cysteine.
