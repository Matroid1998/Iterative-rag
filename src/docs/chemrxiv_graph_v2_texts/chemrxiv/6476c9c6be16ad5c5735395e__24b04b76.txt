Description:
A compound that does not cause chromic changes when added in excess.

Text:
When 1,8diazabicyclo5.4.0undec7ene 
(DBU) was titrated with 2a, the absorption at 450 nm gradually increased and became saturated with 
the addition of 1.0 equivalent of DBU. In contrast, no chromic changes were observed when excess 
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added. The emission spectrum of 2a shows yellowgreen fluorescence 
at 537 nm (ex  381 nm) under neutral conditions (Figure 2b). When DBU was added to the solution 
of 2a, the fluorescence was dramatically strengthened at almost the same wavelength. Reversible 
photophysical changes in 2a with DBU were observed upon the addition of acid. The hyperchromic 
property of 2a is induced by deprotonation of the phenolic proton.
