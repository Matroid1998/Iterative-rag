The activation and functionalization of carbonhydrogen (CH) bonds represent a fundamental challenge in
modern organic chemistry, particularly due to the inherent stability and prevalence of these bonds in organic
molecules. These bonds, which typically exhibit bond energies ranging from 90 to 110 kcalmol, constitute the
majority of bonds in organic chemicals. Therefore, their selective functionalization is essential for advancing
the synthesis of complex molecules like pharmaceuticals, polymers, or agrochemicals.13
Advancements in organometallic catalysis have facilitated significant progress in this area through CH
activation, transforming these inert bonds into reactive carbontransition metal (CM) bonds. Subsequent
transformations of these complexes enable the formation of an array of new functional groups, such as carbon
carbon and carbonheteroatom bonds, underpinning a plethora of synthetic applications.
