Description:
An O2 ligand with elongated, side-on bound OO moieties, 1.4 to 1.5 A.

Various elements, oxidation states, and doccupancies can be
observed in the transition metal centers7 and diverse reactivity, binding modes, and a distribution
in the extent of OO bond activation (typically 1.2 to 1.5 A) in the O2 ligands.8 Nonetheless, on
the basis of spectroscopic, structural, and magnetic measurements, metalO2 compounds can gen
erally be dichotomized according to the electronic character of the dioxygen superoxo (O2 ) or
peroxo (O22).7 Peroxometal adducts constitute the majority of this family9 and tend to feature
elongated, sideon bound OO moieties, 1.4 to 1.5 A. Superoxometal species, on the other hand,
often have shorter, endon OO units, 1.2 to 1.3 A.9 And yet despite the versatility of dioxygen as
a ligand, the maximum known ratio of peroxide ligands to metal center is four10 in the homoleptic
tetraperoxo metal complexes of the form M(2O2)4.
