Description:
Involved in transfer hydrogenation reactions.

Text:
Tshaped P(III) species such as 58 have also been intensively 
evaluated for the development of Pbased catalysts (Figure 
1a).12 Upon planarization of the Patom the original HOMO
LUMO energy gap gets significantly reduced and this facilitates 
the formal oxidative addition of polar HE molecules over the P
atom.13,14 Theoretical studies suggest however that such 
reactions are unlikely to proceed in a concerted fashion at the P
center, but rather through cooperation with the ligand.15 A 
catalytic cycle based on the use of these P(III)P(V) couples has 
been engineered consisting on the transfer hydrogenation 
between ammonia borane and azobenzene.16 Interestingly, 
although the two strategies just showcased seem to be unrelated, 
they actually rely on the same principle the promotion of biphilic 
behavior at the central Patom by imposing nontrigonal 
geometries.
