Description:
A dispersion-dominated complex that challenges generalized gradient approximations in density functional theory.

Text:
The description of noncovalent inter
actions within density functional theory (DFT) has im
proved dramatically over the past two decades, rela
tive to a starting point where generalized gradient ap
proximations (GGAs) predict interaction potentials that
are unbound for dispersiondominated complexes such
raregas dimers or even (C6H6)2.1 The rst function
als to deal with this problem in a generally eective
way were those with empirical atomatom dispersion po
tentials added ad hoc.1,2 These dispersioncorrected or
DFTD methods remain tremendously important in
contemporary DFT,13 and modern versions of the dis
persion corrections resemble proper atomic C6 coe
cients in the separatedatom limit.4,5 (Doublecounting
of correlation eects at van der Waals contact distances
does remain an issue, however.1,6,7) Early versions of
the DFTD approach8 were quickly followed by semi
empirical metaGGA functionals that signicantly out
performed GGAs for van der Waals complexes,912 al
though not always for the right reasons.1315 Rather, be
cause the semilocal metaGGA framework has a much
longer range in real space, due to its dependence on the
density Laplacian and the kinetic energy density, meta
GGAs aord nonvanishing interactions in the region of
nonbonded close contacts (unlike typical GGAs), and
noncovalent interactions may therefore emerge upon suf
cient parameterization.
