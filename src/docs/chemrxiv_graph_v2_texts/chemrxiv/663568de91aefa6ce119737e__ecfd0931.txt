Description:
Complexes with potential medicinal applications and novel magnetic properties.

Text:
Since the near simultaneous discovery of the Cr(O2)43 and Ta(O2)43 ions by Riesen
feld et al.11 and Balke,12 respectively, in 1905, synthetic procedures for a number of mononuclear
tetraperoxometalates have appeared.10,13 Presently, single crystal structures have been reported for
Cr,14 Mo,15 W,16 V,17 Nb,18 and Ta,19 featuring a variety of alkali and ammoniumbased coun
tercations.10 Characterizations of these conceptually simple complexes in the intervening decades
have uncovered novel magnetic properties20 and several potential medicinal applications, such as
sources of singlet oxygen,21 enzyme inhibitors,22 and insulin mimetic agents.23 Synthetic interest
has stemmed from their use as precursor materials for heteroleptic catalysts.24 This experimental
research has proceeded in spite of the thermal instability10 (sometimes explosive) and limited to
nonexistent aqueous phase chemistry often exhibited by these materials.9,25 Theoretical studies
starting in 1960s are also extant and have primarily focused on the orbital interactions between
