Redox-sensitive amino acids that can be profiled using chemical biology workflows.

unbiased computational search approaches39. For ease of discussion, we refer to the two different 
approaches as activitybased and reactionbased, respectively and outline modern platforms 
from both categories below. Although previous platformsmethods like oxidative isotopecoded 
affinity tags (OxICAT), resinassisted capture (RAC) and biotin switch technique (BST) serve 
historical importance in the redox biology field, they are considered inefficient by todays standard 
and their pitfalls have been thoroughly discussed4042. Fig. 4 Chemical biology workflows used to profile redoxsensitive cysteines. a Differential

red boxes. The isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysisactivitybased protein profiling (ISOTOPABBP) 
platform utilizes an IAalkyne probe, consisting of a thiolreactive iodoacetamide moiety and a 
clickable alkyne handle for enrichment43.
