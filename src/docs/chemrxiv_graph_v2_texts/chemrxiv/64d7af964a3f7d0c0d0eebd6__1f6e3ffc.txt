Description:
Preferred for its chelating effects and buffering properties in cosmetics and personal care products.

pH adjustment is important across several product development processes, including in the 
formulations, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and the food and beverage industries (17). The 
pH can affect the functionality, performance, and safety of the product. Our study focuses on 
the industrially motivated problem statement to titrate a wide range of shampoolike 
formulations. Manufacturers typically adjust shampoo to between pH 5.5  7 to prevent scalp 
irritation (from lower pHs) and are nonalkaline to prevent cuticle damage and frizzy hair (3, 
4). In principle, the pH can be lowered with any acid, however, industrially many consumer 
care formulations, including shampoo, are adjusted with citric acid (810). Citric acid 
(H3C6H5O7) is preferred as it can contribute chelating effects and buffering properties to 
cosmetics and personal care products (8).
