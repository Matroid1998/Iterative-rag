Description:
Oxidized using NH2OH generated in situ, requiring elevated temperatures and high pH.

More specifically, the 
hydrogenation route is limited by the requirements of pressurized H2 gas, strong acidic 
conditions, as well as precious metal catalysts. Moreover, transportation and storage of 
concentrated NH2OH also faces challenges, including the risk of explosion.7 On the other hand, 
NH3 oxidation utilizes NH2OH generated insitu as needed.4 Yet, this synthetic route still 
demands elevated temperatures, high pH, and an excess of H2O2 as oxidant, which also has 
transportation and storage issues.8, 9 Hence, there is a strong desire for an alternative strategy 
to produce cyclohexanone oxime under mild conditions.

A byproduct of NO3R reactions.

formic acid or CO) to produce 
formamide.30, 31 Despite these distinctive methods, current studies on CN bond formation via 
NO3R mainly focus on coupling NO3R intermediates with C1C2 molecules (e.g. CO2, CO, 
formic acid, oxalic acid). There are a few recent reports on electrochemical NO3R systems 
which can build CN bonds in larger organic molecules (i.e. C3 compounds), such as amino 
acid32, 33 and oxime.3437 However, NO3R can make a variety of Ncontaining byproducts (e.g. N2, NH3, N2O, NO2), and therefore the understanding of the complicated NO3R reaction 
pathways and the controlling of N selectivity towards the desired organonitrogen products 
remain elusive.
