Description:
Forms a neutral radical upon first electron reduction between 0.9 V and 1.2 V vs SCE.

Text:
These reductions can be intercepted after the first electron transfer, with rapid formation of 
enzymatically inactive dimers (rate constant for dimerization exceeds 107 M1s1).8 The first one
electron reduction of NAD occurs between 0.9 V and 1.2 V, and the resulting neutral pyridine 
radical can be further reduced near 1.6 V to form the enzymatically active 1,4dihydropyridine 
(all potentials reported vs SCE).8,9
