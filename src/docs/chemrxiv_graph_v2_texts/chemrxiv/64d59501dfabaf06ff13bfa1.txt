Description:
An organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite with outstanding carrier mobilities and excellent optical absorption.

Text:
As promising candidates for various optoelectronic applications, perovskitestructured ma
terials have attracted tremendous research attention in the scientific community.15 With
the attractive superior virtues involving outstanding carrier mobilities, excellent optical ab
sorption as well as low trap densities,6,7 the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of organic
inorganic hybrid halide perovskites (e.g. MAPbI3) solar cells have been boosted from 3.8 to
26.1 over the past decade.8 The extensive commercialization of hybrid halide perovskites
is, however, largely hampered by two key challenges poor longterm stability and severe
toxicity (Pb).911 The degradation of most hybrid halide perovskites occurs rapidly and ir
reversibly, due to the intrinsic low formation energy.

Description:
A material with optoelectronic properties similar to those of materials with substituted Sn2 ions.

Text:
Substituting the Pb2 ion with the
less toxic Sn2 ion enables materials with similar optoelectronic properties to MAPbI3, but
encounter even more serious stability issues due to the easy oxidation12,13 of Sn2 to Sn4.
