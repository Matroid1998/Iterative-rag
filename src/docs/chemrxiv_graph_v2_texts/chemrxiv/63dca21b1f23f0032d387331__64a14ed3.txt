Description:
Serves as an important energy vector and its production is associated with a significant carbon footprint.

A significantly 
more daunting task is the conversion of N2 to N2H4 
which is also thermodynamically uphill ( Gof (298 K) 
of N2H4 (from N2 and H2) is 159.2 kJmol ) along 
with the kinetic challenge associated with N2 
activation process 4. N2H4 can serve as an important 
energy vector 5. Moreover, if it can be produced in 
a carbon neutral path may make chemical hydrogen 
storage feasible and sustainable 6. Current industrial 
methods for producing N2H4 indirectly depend upon 
the HaberBosch process which produces NH3 
feedstocks. Thus commercial N2H4 production is 
associated with a significant carbon footprint. In 
nature, the conversion of N2 to NH3 is achieved under 
ambient conditions by the nitrogenase enzyme7,8.
