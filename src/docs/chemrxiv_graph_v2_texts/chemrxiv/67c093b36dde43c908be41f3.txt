Description:
Released as a byproduct during the photocleavage of the o-nitrobenzyl group.

A recentlydeveloped alternative approach to study reac
tive sulfur species (RSS) involves lighttriggered donors, as 
they have distinct advantages including high availability, 
modularity, and precise control over release in biochemical 
systems, while minimizing sideproduct formation.25 In 
2017, Pluth and coworkers reported the first COSH2S do
nors activated by UV light (  365 nm), leveraging the pho
tocleavage of the onitrobenzyl group (Figure 1b) to release 
COS and aniline.21 However, phototoxicity may occur due to 
prolonged UV light exposure which could limit the broad 
applicability of this material. To overcome this issue, 
BODIPYbased photolabile H2Sdonors with visible light ac
tivation were explored.
