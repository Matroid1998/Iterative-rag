Description:
Used in practical catalysis with surface morphology tailored for high efficiency through chemical vapor deposition.

Text:
Therefore, tailoring the catalysts surface morphology 
towards high efficiency on large scale is crucial for 
implementation of ZrN in practical catalysis.1 
These challenges motivate the use of chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) as the method of choice for ZrN deposition since it allows 
precise tuning of the surface features as well as the composition 
of the material, by variation of the process parameters including
