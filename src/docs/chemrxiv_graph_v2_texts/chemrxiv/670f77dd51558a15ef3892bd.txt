Alternatively, SBBs can be presynthesized and isolated prior to 
the construction of MOFs, thereby bypassing the formation of low
connectivity nets.1618 This second strategy provides a stepwise 
addition of components, thus an enhanced control over network 
composition, leading to the synthesis of complex structures such 
as hollow, shaped matryoshka architectures19 and multivariate 
MOFs, otherwise inaccessible via onepot methods.20 This 
approach remains underexplored due to the scarcity of suitable 
MOPs that can function as SBBs. The 
prototypical 
dirhodium 
paddlewheelbased 
cuboctahedral MOP Rh2(Rbdc)212 (Rbdc  isophthalate 
derivatives) is among the most studied structures for constructing 
extended networks.21 For instance, introducing carboxylic acid
