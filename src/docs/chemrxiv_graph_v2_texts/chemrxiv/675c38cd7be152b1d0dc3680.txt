Description:
A material with ultramicroporous pores used as an electrode in capacitors.

Text:
of a sieving carbon with ultramicroporous pores (d  0.69 nm) as one 
electrode material an effective blocking of ions with sizes below the pore size of the carbon can 
be achieved, leading to a unidirectional charging comparable to a diode (CAPode). This 
working capacitor (WCap) was further expanded by introducing a third (gate) electrode 
enabling a control of current and voltage output of the WCap depending on the applied gate 
bias between gate electrode and counter electrode of the WCap resembling transistor features. By varying the gate bias voltage, the potentials and therefore the working window of the W
