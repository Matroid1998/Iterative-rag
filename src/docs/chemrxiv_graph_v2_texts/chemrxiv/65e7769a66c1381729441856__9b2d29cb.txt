Description:
Chemicals frequently used in traditional thermochemical methods for CO2 capture.

Text:
Electrochemical methods for CO2 capture and concentration have emerged as potentially safer, energy 
efficient, modular and scalable alternative to traditional thermochemical methods which tend to be 
energyintensive, and frequently use toxic, and corrosive chemicals such as amines, and hydroxides.
