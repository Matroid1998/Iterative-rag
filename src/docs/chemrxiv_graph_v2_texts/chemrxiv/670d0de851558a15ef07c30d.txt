Description:
Used in the cumene process to treat cumene and yield phenol and acetone.

Text:
Some aldehydes and ketones belong to the most important chemicals produced and used in 
chemical industry as well as in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry with formaldehyde, 
acetone and butanone being the most prominent examples. Industrially, different synthesis 
routes are applied. In the direct oxidation of alkenes, which is namely the HchstWacker 
process, palladium(II) chloride and copper(II) chloride are used as catalysts 1. The oxidative 
dehydrogenation of alcohols as used in the Formox process for the production of formaldehyde 
patented by JohnsonMatthey relies on either iron molybdate or silver metal 2. The route 
predominantly used for the production of acetone today is the cumene process, where benzene 
and propene form cumene, which is treated with oxygen to yield phenol and acetone 1.
