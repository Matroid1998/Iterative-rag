section 
that Cu NCs have garnered significant attention as catalysts 
for electrochemical CO2RR due to their high reactivity and 
unique structural architecture, which can selectively tune 
product formation. In this work, we aim to explore the 
potential of a uniquely designed Cu23 NC as a catalyst for 
CO2RR. To perform the electrochemical measurements, a 
thin film electrode was fabricated using a spray coating 
technique. This involved depositing a slurry of the Cu23 NCs 
and carbon black (CB) onto a carbon paper substrate. It is 
crucial to maintain the geometric and electronic structure 
of the NCs during this loading process to preserve their 
electrocatalytic properties. The stability of the Cu23 NCs 
during this process was assessed using Xray absorption 
fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy.

Notably, 
the current density remained stable over this extended 
period, showing no discernible degradation. Following this 
prolonged electrochemical catalysis, we further assessed 
the stability of the Cu NCs outside the electrochemical 
environment after electrocatalysis. TEM image confirmed 
the structural integrity of the NCs, evidenced by the 
consistent size of the individual clusters (Figure S14). However, the Cu Kedge XANES spectra revealed a 
significant change in spectral features in respect to the 
before catalysis, however the electronic structure still 
maintains the Cu(I) environment from the similar peak top 
8994 eV (Figure S15). The shift in FTEXAFS spectra for 
changing CuS or P bond clarifies such drastic shift in the
