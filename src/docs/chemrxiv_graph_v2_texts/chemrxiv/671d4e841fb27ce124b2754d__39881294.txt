Acetone molecule activation 
The serendipitous discovery of the unusual acetone activation 
by the cobalt complex of a modified porphyrin (Scheme 1) 
occurred while trying to insert a cobalt ion into azuliporphyrin 1 
in a different than previously solvent to form a known 4
coordinate regular complex (with CNNN coordination).27 
Instead of seeing a wellknown lowspin CoII pattern in the 1H 
NMR spectrum, we received a previously unobserved highspin 
(HS) complex with unusually shielded signals at as far as 101.4 
ppm (at 300 K). Isolation of this species (2) allowed for a detailed investigation. The 1H NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 1 presents a symmetric 
pattern coming from protons of a parent ligand with preserved 
a.
