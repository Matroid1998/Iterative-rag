Description:
A promising photoanode material for water oxidation due to its suitable bandgap.

Text:
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semicon
ductor photoelectrodes is regarded as a promising and sustain
able strategy to address the future supply of energy in a sus
tainable way.1,2 However, the search for robust and efficient 
photoanode materials for water oxidation remains one of the 
biggest challenges for practical applications.3 Bismuth vana
date (BiVO4) is one of the most promising photoanode materi
als as it combines a suitable bandgap (ca.
