Description:
A stabilizer used in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia for solid oxide fuel cells.

It has been proposed that using materials operating at intermediate 
temperatures could expand applications of fuel cells to largescale stationary applications and 
smaller scale portable powertransportation markets 10,11. While YttriaStabilized Zirconia 
(YSZ) has been the most investigated membrane material for SOFCs as well as SOECs, Scandia
Stabilized Zirconia (SSZ) has shown almost 34 times higher ionic conductivity compared to that 
of YSZ 9,1215. Moreover, YSZ exhibits a conductivity degradation by an imbalanced
