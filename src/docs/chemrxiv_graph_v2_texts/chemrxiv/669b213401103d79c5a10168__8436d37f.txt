Description:
A BN helicene enantiomer constructed with sulfur atoms and acridan substituents to disrupt peripheral symmetry.

Text:
constructed a pair of greenishblue BN
4helicene enantiomers employing sulfur atoms and acridan substituents to disrupt peripheral 
symmetry, realizing a glum of (1.02.0)103 and an FWHM of 43 nm.9 Based on this emitting 
core, Yang et al. enhanced the helicity of helicenes by developing a pair of green BN
5helicene enantiomers, which exhibited glums of 2.02.1103 and an FWHM of 46 nm.10 
Wang et al. also reported a green BN6helicene CPL emitter utilizing an edgetopology 
molecularengineering strategy, featuring glums of 5.193.81104 for the enantiomers and a 
relatively small FWHM of 35 nm.11 Quite recently, Chen and Li et al.
