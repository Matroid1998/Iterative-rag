Description:
A ligand previously used in the Blight group.

Text:
Structure of benzimidazole Thiourea 1 and Guanidine 2 ligands previously used in the 
Blight group.21 
Previous work in our group has centred around the study of Ir (III) guanidine and thiourea 
based complexes as photoactive molecules capable of Hbonding.2122 How the Hbonding 
impacts on the photoactivity of the complexes was also studied along with the strength of the 
binding. Herein, we present several complexes, centred around Rh (III), Co (II) and Pt (II) 
metals. These complexes were characterised using mass spectrometry, CHN combustion
