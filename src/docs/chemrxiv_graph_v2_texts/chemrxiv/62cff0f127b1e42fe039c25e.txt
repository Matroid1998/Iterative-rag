Description:
Generated at the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction during water electrolysis.

Text:
During water electrolysis, hydrogen is produced through electrochemical reduction of 
water at the cathode while the anode oxidizes water to oxygen via the oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER). Due to their high activity, perovskite oxides containing transition metals are among the 
most attractive electrocatalytic materials for water oxidation.1,2 However, during OER, perovskites 
experience corrosive degradation through the formation of oxidized and watersoluble transition 
metal species on the surface.310 A lack of fundamental understanding of how structure and 
composition of perovskite surfaces evolves during OER and which mechanisms drive their 
electrochemical degradation poses a significant challenge to the development of stable and active 
electrocatalysts.1114 
Several major pathways for the electrochemical degradation of perovskite electrocatalysts 
have been proposed.

Description:
Involved in the evolution that modifies the ligand coordination of surface transition metal ions.

Text:
Finally, the evolution of lattice oxygen 
modifies the ligand coordination of surface transition metal ions, becoming an additional factor in 
the degradation of a perovskite.2123 For clarity, we define leaching as an ion deinsertion process 
that preserves the structural motif of an oxide (i.e., a topochemical reaction involving vacancies), 
while dissolution is a complete structural disintegration of the surface layer through the solvation 
of the transition metal ions. Strontium iridate (SrIrO3) has recently attracted attention owing to its exceptionally high 
OER activity proposed to originate through Sr2 leaching and surface amorphization.3,7,8,10,2428 
Assuming that Sr2 leaching involves electrochemical deinsertion (Path 1 as opposed to Path 2 in 
Equations S1), electrochemical leaching of Sr2 from SrIrO3 involves two holes (h).
