Description:
An electrocatalyst developed as part of Department of Energy projects.

Text:
This class of electrocatalysts has reached 
significant development as part of past Department of Energy (DoE) projects (in particularly 
dealloyed PtCoC and PtNiC electrocatalysts) 2426 and resulted in record inMEA activities 
that exceed the DoE performance targets 27 of 0.44 AmgPt with 40 activity loss after 30k 
voltage cycles in the RDE and MEAs 28. For this class of electrocatalysts, alloying is usually 
obtained via hightemperature thermal annealing 29. In addition to the importance of the bulk crystal structure of the Ptalloy NPs, dealloying 
(activation) step of the electrocatalyst also holds a crucial importance 30,31. Relatively recently, 
transition metal cation (e.g. Ni, Co, Cu, Fe, ) contamination in the PEMFC has been 
recognised as another probable major contributor towards poor HCD performance when using
