Lithiumion batteries have emerged as the main technology in electrical energy storage due
to their high energy density and long cycle life.1 However, the traditional liquid electrolytes
used in Liion batteries still present significant safety concerns, including the risk of leakage,
flammability, and thermal instability.24 Solid polymer electrolytes offer a promising alter
native as their higher electrochemical stability, mechanical flexibility, ease of fabrication,
and high property tunability could enhance the overall performance and safety of Liion and
pave the way for Limetal batteries.57 On the downside, polymer electrolytes suffer from
low roomtemperature ionic conductivity due to low solubility of lithium salts in polymers,
and limited chain dynamics to facilitate ion conduction.8,9 Low transference number is a
common limitation of polymer electrolytes, which leads to concentration gradients that de
crease battery performance at high current density.10 The majority of the work on polymer
electrolytes has concentrated on Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and while other systems such
as polynitriles, carbonyls, and single ion conductors have been proposed, none have reached
ionic conductivity on par with liquid electrolytes at room temperature.1114
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate diffusion mechanisms
and structural properties in polymer electrolytes.
