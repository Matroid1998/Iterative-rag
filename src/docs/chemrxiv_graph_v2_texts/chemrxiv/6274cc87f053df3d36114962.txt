Description:
Materials based on this compound enable dual phosphorescence from T1 and an H-aggregation stabilized species.

To date, there are only a few documented 
examples where RTP originates from a higherlying triplet excited state.10, 16 For instance, Tang 
and coworkers reported several benzothiophene derivatives showing dual phosphorescence, 
which was assumed to originate from both the first (T1) and second (T2) triplet excited states 
(Figure 1a).16b Huang and coworkers designed materials based on carbazole that enabled dual 
phosphorescence from T1 and an Haggregation stabilized species (T1, T1 T1) (Figure 1b).16c, 16d 
However, this dual phosphorescence was only observed to occur in crystals, making it difficult to
