Description:
A chemical present in hospital laundry effluents.

Text:
Among 
the various sectors, laundry is classified as the sector that demands the highest volumes 
of water that generates a proportional amount of complex effluents with high toxicity and 
recalcitrance.7,22,3640 
Due to the diversity of chemicals added to the washing processes, hospital laundry 
effluents may contain soap,29,41 detergents,4144 surfactants,41,45,46 sodium hypochlorite,47,48 
hydrogen peroxide,7,49,50 peracetic acid,4951 softeners,52,53 neutralizing additives,54 
chlorine,43,44,48 adsorbable organic halogens (AOX),44,55 nitrogen, phosphorus,7,37,56 and 
heavy metals5760 that give these residues the power to exercise less biodegradable 
characteristics to the effluent generated by the hospital units.9 
However, tissues from different areas such as the operating room, intensive care 
unit, hospitalization, hemodialysis, imaging, emergency room, among others, are sources 
of dirt such as blood, pus, medication residues, secretions and excretions,6164 which can 
contain pathogenic bacteria,49,51,71,54,61,6570 fungi or viruses.56,7274 Besides, a high 
concentration of particulate material, organic matter, proteins, starch, oils and greases40,75 
can be found.
