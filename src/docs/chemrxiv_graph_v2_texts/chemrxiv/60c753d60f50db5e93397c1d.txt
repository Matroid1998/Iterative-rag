Studied for their herbicidal effects using multiple linear regression.

Pioneered by Corwin Hansch in the 1960s, Quantitative StructureActivity Relationships (QSARs) and 
Quantitative StructureProperty Relationships (QSPRs) have been extensively studied for several years. Hansch pioneered the work in this area with his studies of the herbicidal effects of phenylacetic acids 
using multiple linear regression (MLR), an approach that is relevant even today owing to its simplicity 
and ease of interpretability1. Since then, QSARs have evolved tremendously, both in terms of the 
dimensionality and chemometric methods, with the traditional Hansch approach being supplemented 
with blackbox machine learning and deep learning methods coupled with increasing dimensionality 
3D, 4D, 5D, and even 6DQSAR. The advantages of multidimensional QSAR are obvious; the 
consideration of 3D structure and stereochemistry, which its 2D counterpart simply cannot do.
