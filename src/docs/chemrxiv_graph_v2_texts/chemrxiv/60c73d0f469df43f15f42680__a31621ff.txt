Description:
The method failed for 1,2,4triazoles, indicating challenges in predicting their reactivity.

Text:
Conversely, DFT calculations
are timeconsuming for larger compounds and cannot be performed by nonexpert users and there is a certain degree of
subjectiveness in predicting the regioselectivity based on the HOMO orbitals. Finally, the sound judgment of chemists was
required to evaluate the reactivity of unsubstituted and electrondecient benzenes, and the method failed for 1,2,4triazoles.
