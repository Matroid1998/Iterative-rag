Description:
A salt used to stabilize nucleic acids and proteins in solutions.

Text:
To perform this assay, a single colony of the E. coli strains (in case of the control with 
the vector containing a cloned cyclic diGMP binding protein (YcgR or BcsE) and its 
relevant nonbinding mutant) were inoculated 1100 from an overnight culture in LB 
medium with the relevant antibiotic. After induction with 0.1 Larabinose at 30C 
for four hours, cells were harvested by resuspension in binding buffer (10 mM Tris 
pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, in Chromasolv H2O; 11 with 100 l lysozyme 
(500 gml) per OD6003 (4, 12). Cells were disrupted by two freezethaw cycles of 
1h at room temperature and at 80C.
