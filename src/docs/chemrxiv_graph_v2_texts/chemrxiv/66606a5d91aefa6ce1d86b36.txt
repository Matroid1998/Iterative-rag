Description:
A specially designed radical precursor.

Recently, new synthetic methods 
for these compounds have also emerged.10,11 The radical
radical coupling provides a straightforward approach, and 
the catalytic reductive homocoupling of benzyl halides has 
been intensively developed.12 While visible lightmediated 
variants have also been developed, applicable substrates 
are primarily limited to bromide1319 (Figure 1A). Other 
specially designed radical precursors, including sulfone,20 
phosphonium salt,21 organozinc,22 and others23,24 have 
been continuously developed. However, benzyl chloride 
remains an elusive substrate in visible light catalysis. Acti
vation of benzyl chloride has been achieved with a dinu
clear copper catalyst with an electrophotochemical set
ting,25 and some inorganic photocatalysis, such as home
made Nickelgraphitic carbon nitride (NigCN)26 or UV 
lightinduced Culoaded ZnO nanoparticle27 have also ac
complished homocoupling (Figure 1B).
