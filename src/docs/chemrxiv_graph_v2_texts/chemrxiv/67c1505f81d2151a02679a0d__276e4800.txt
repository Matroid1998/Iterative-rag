Description:
A system whose fband role in regulating surface redox reactions is less explored.

Text:
Thus, establishing a quantitative correlation between the 4f band structure 
and surface reaction kinetics is essential to predict and optimize the redox behavior of REO2x 
systems. While the roles of dband in transition metals and pband in perovskite oxides are well 
established11,12, the role of fband of REO2x in regulating the surface redox reaction remains much 
less explored from an experimental point of view, limiting the further performance optimization 
for REO2based materials and supported catalysts. Electronic structure modulation has been achieved through methods such as doping13, surface 
reduction14, nanostructuring15, and control of oxidation states16.
