Description:
Used in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for modifying surface properties and reactivity.

Text:
Metallic substrates modified by thiolatebased selfassembled monolayers 
(SAMs) have been used in diverse technological applications including molecular 
electronics, biotechnology, and for modification of various surface properties.1,2 
They have also been used to modify reactivity and selectivity toward thermo and 
electrochemical catalyzed surface reactions.39 Thiolate SAMs can be deposited 
on different metallic surfaces by gasphase or liquidphase adsorption of 
precursors such as thiols, disulfides, or thioalkoxide salt solutions. It has been 
shown that the final (equilibrium) saturation coverage and corresponding SAM 
structure do not depend on the preparation method.10 Thus, on a perfectly flat 
and defectfree surface, the configuration of a SAM tends toward a dense, 
organized upright arrangement as the thiol concentrationdose or adsorption time 
increases.

Description:
Forms gold adatom-thiolate complexes on Au(111) with a saturation surface coverage of 0.33 for linear alkanethiolate-based SAMs.

The evolution and geometry of these structures are driven mainly by 
the stabilization resulting from van der Waals (vdW) interactions between 
adjacent adsorbed molecules.1,2 However, in addition to the molecular 
phenomenon of selforganization, it has also been demonstrated that, on some 
surfaces, the adsorption of thiol molecules can cause considerable 
reorganization or reconstruction of the surface itself. On Au(111), for example, thiolinduced reconstruction is associated with 
formation of atomic vacancies (VAu) and corresponding gold adatomthiolate 
complexes ((RS)xAuad, x  1  4), where the Auad species is generally bonded 
to threefold hollow sites on the underlying Au(111) substrate.11 Increasing 
coverage () of the thiol promotes increasing degrees of surface reconstruction.12 
For linear alkanethiolatebased SAMs, (RS)2Auad species are mainly formed, 
with a thiolate saturation surface coverage of 0.33.
