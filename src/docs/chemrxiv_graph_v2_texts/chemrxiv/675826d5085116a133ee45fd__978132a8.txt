Description:
A promising Lewis acid used for CH functionalisation and CC bond formation reactions.

Text:
Rareearth metal ions (Sc, Y, lanthanides) have 
attracted significant attention, mainly due to their 
Lewis acidity and oxophilicity. In particular, 
Sc(OTf)3 has been introduced in recent decades as a 
promising Lewis acid for CH functionalisation and 
CC bond formation reactions.1,2 In the past 20 years, 
scandium salts have also effectively assumed a role 
in photoredox catalysisa process that has emerged 
as a fullfledged alternative in organic synthesis, 
often unlocking transformations that are not 
attainable in the dark.36 Photoredox catalysis relies 
on an electron transfer process between a highly 
reactive, lightexcited catalyst and a redoxlabile 
substrate (S). The result is a reactive radical 
intermediate that undergoes further transformations, 
ultimately resulting in the formation of new bonds 
under mild conditions.

Description:
Facilitates photoinduced electron transfer transformations involving dioxygen.

Thus, an 
electron transfer from donor (D) to O2, which is 
thermodynamically infeasible in the absence of 
metal ions, becomes possible in the presence of Mn. This process is generally called metal ioncoupled 
electron transfer (MCET).12,22,23 Scandium3 ion, 
with its smallest radius among M3, can bind strongly 
with O2, making it far more effective than other 
Mn ions for providing SET reactions driven by 
MnO2 complex formation12,2429 
A review of previous reports on the role of Sc(OTf)3 
in 
photoinduced 
electron 
transfer 
(PET) 
transformations involving the reductive activation of 
dioxygen confirms that a lightabsorbing electron 
donor and additional stabilisation are necessary.
