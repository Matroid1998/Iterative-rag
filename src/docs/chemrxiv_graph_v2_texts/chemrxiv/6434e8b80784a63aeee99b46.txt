Description:
A redox-active ligand used in metal-bridged mixed-valence systems.

Classic 
MV examples, possessing two redoxactive metal sites con
nected by a conjugated bridge (Scheme 1B),2e have been 
tuned by changing the metal centers,7 the bridge,8 or the an
cillary ligands.9 Likewise, organic MV systems have proven 
to be exceptionally tunable owing to the synthetic versatil
ity of organic chemistry.1012 These examples reveal how 
coupling is influenced by a variety of factors, including the 
length and conjugation pathway of the bridge,11 as well as 
its orbital energies relative to those of the redox sites.10b,12 
However, there remain substantial limitations to the con
trol that can be attained over electronic delocalization in 
many MV systems, especially those in which two organic re
dox sites are coupled by a bridging metal ion.13 
Though less studied than bimetallic and fully organic ex
amples, metalbridged MV systems include complexes of re
doxactive 
salen,2g,14 
diarylamido,15 
pyridinediimine 
(PDI),16 and dithiolene ligands (Scheme 2A).17,18 In all these
