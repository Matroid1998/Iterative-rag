Description:
A structure where one macrocyclic ring rotates around another, with directional motion.

They include catenane based structures as first 
developed by Leigh, where rotation of one macrocyclic ring around another proceeds directionally 
(for selected examples see 1921), chemically driven variants rotating around a single bond22 as 
pioneered again by Feringa,23, 24 surface bound structures rotating around an axis perpendicular to 
the surface and energized by electric current,25, 26 or just recently added electrically driven versions 
in solution.27 Further examples include linear molecular motors such as walkers28, 29 and pumps,30
36 which use distinct mechanisms and fuels to achieve a directional linear motion. When it comes 
to fueling however, simple illumination is particularly attractive because energy can be supplied 
continuously and precisely dosed, no waste is accumulated during operation, and the energy 
content of photons is very high.
