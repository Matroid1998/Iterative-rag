Description:
A compound that is robust towards CH activation.

Text:
Metalcyanomethyl complexes are the simplest examples of cyanoalkyl ligands and 
are therefore a fundamental category of organometallic species. They can be formally viewed 
as deprotonated acetonitrile complexes, and they have been shown to react as nucleophiles in 
carboncarbon bondforming reactions to form nitrile compounds, but these uses are 
hampered by the difficulty in forming the active cyanoalkyl species through direct CH bond 
cleavage.1 While the robustness of acetonitrile towards CH activation hinders the use of this
