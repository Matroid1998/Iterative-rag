Description:
Used as a primary network in hydrogel photopolymers.

However, GelMAs natural origin leads to variability in its final chemical structure, 
driven by differences in molecular weight distribution and the inherent randomness of gelatin 
modification processes15. These properties subsequently raise the costs associated with highquality, low
variability commercial GelMA products and limits reproducible VAM experimentation2, 13, 16. Other 
contemporary hydrogel photopolymers have focused on the use of thermogelling materials, with 
norbornene and allyl functionalized gelatin17, 18 as primary networks, and nonfunctionalized gelatin as 
a secondary network12. Here, we aim to decouple the need for thermogelling VAM photopolymers by 
introducing a secondary physical hydrogel to enhance the printability of low cost, small molecular weight 
photopolymers. The photoactive material platform investigated here is based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate 
(PEGDA) and is well characterized from the tissue engineering research perspective.
