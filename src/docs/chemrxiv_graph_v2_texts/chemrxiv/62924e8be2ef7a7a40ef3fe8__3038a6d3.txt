Description:
An abundant element in the earth's crust, used in sodium-ion batteries.

Text:
One of the efficient ways to store energy is through electrochemical cells, and among
various choices, rechargeable lithiumion batteries (LIBs) are at the forefront due to their high
energy efficiency and low maintenance cost.25 However, the major drawback of LIBs is the
unequal distribution of their raw materials over the globe and the limited availability of lithium in
the earths crust, leading to geopolitical tensions. While there are several alternatives to LIBs,612 sodiumion batteries (NIBs) have gained
considerable attention since sodium is abundant in the earths crust (sixth most abundant
element).

Description:
Has a reduction potential of 2.71 V.

Text:
Its resources are distributed nearly equally throughout the world, and it has a lower
cost of extraction.13 Further, since Li and Na are located in the same group of the periodic table
and since they both possess only one electron in their valence shell, it is expected that the
nature of the electrochemical halfcell reactions would be the same. Also, the reduction potential
of sodium is just 0.33 V above the lithium (E0
NaNa  2.71 V and E0
LiLi  3.04 V).
