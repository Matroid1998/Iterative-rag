Description:
Synthesized using heteroanionic materials as electrocatalysts.

Text:
Heteroanionic materials are a class of transition metal com
pounds in which metal cations coordinate with two or more
anions. This class includes materials such as metal oxysul
des, metal oxynitrides, and metal oxyuorides. Heteroanionic
materials have several applications, including in energy stor
age as battery cathode materials, 1 in solidstate illumination
as phosphor materials, 2 and in ammonia synthesis as electro
catalysts. 3 The heteroanionic material design space is vast ow
ing to the many possible combinations of metal cations, anion
choice, anion ordering, and lattice structures. 1 Perovskites are
a subset of heteroanionic compounds characterized by at least
two metal cations surrounded by anions arranged in octahedral
geometries.
