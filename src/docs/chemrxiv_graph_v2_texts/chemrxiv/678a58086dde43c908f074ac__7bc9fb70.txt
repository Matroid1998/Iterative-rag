Description:
Biodegradable molecules that prevent accumulation in the environment.

Text:
Biodegradability is a highly desired property as it prevents PEG molecules from accumulating 
in the environment and, therefore, constrains the exposure component in environmental risk 
assessment scenarios, irrespective of potential hazard, which is object of investigation of aca
demic research as well as product safety screening studies.1520
