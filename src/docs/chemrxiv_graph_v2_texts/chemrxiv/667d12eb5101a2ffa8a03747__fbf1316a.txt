Description:
SMMs with two mutually trans anionic ligands show the largest Ueff from stabilising the largest mJ projections in the ground state.

Singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) show magnetic remanence,1 and lanthanide (Ln) SMMs 
have provided the largest effective energy barriers to magnetic reversal (Ueff) and hysteresis 
temperatures (TH) to date.24 These advances have been driven by classical electrostatic design 
criteria to increase magnetic anisotropy, where Dy(III) and Tb(III) SMMs with two mutually trans 
anionic ligands show the largest Ueff from stabilising the largest mJ projections in the ground state 
and destabilising the smaller mJ states.57 Perfectly linear (i.e. with a C axis) Dy(III) and Tb(III) 
complexes would have pure mJ states, which would suppress twophonon Raman and quantum 
tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) relaxation processes, giving high TH values. However, any 
deviation from linearity introduces transverse fields that mix the mJ states, reducing TH.
