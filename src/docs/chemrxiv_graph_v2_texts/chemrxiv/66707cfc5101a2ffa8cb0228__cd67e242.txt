Description:
Recurring motifs in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
ArylAlkyl ethers and anilines are recurring motifs in medicinal chemistry. Highthroughput 
synthesis and testing of aryl CO and CN compound libraries accelerates structureactivity 
relationship exploration. Alkyl alcohols and amines are among the most abundant and diverse 
building blocks for library synthesis,1 enabling exploration of a broad chemical space to improve 
overall biological profile and lead compound identification. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024rr07j ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000192622197 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
