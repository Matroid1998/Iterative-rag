Human respiratory viruses pose devastating threats on public health and the economy as demonstrated by 
40 
the SARSCoV2 virus responsible for the COVID19 pandemic. SARSCoV2 encodes two cysteine 
41 
proteases, main protease (MPro) and papainlike protease (PLPro), which are responsible for cleaving 11 and 
42 
3 sites respectively along the viral polyprotein and enable infection. Considerable research efforts have 
43 
been made to establish inhibitors for these viral proteases, resulting in several clinically available 
44 
therapeutics including nirmatrelvir1,2. Despite these important medicines providing therapeutic benefit, there 
45 
is a concern for the development of antiviral resistance as well as the emergence of other pandemic threat 
46 
respiratory viruses3,4.
