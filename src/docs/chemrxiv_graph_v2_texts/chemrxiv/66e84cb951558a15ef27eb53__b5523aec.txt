Description:
A more nucleophilic base that inhibits reactions due to preferential coordination to nickel.

Text:
Milder and more costeffective alkyl amines present a promising alternative but often lack sufficient basicity for effective 
deprotonation.44 To tackle this, Buchwald and coworkers elegantly designed an electrondeficient ligand that allows the 
deprotonation of nickelbound anilines with triethylamine for crosscoupling with aryl triflates.45 Notably, using the more 
nucleophilic base, DBU, inhibits the reaction due to its preferential coordination to nickel, demonstrating the additional layer 
of complexity in achieving the optimal balance between ligands and bases when working with weakly nucleophilic coupling 
partners.

Description:
An organic base used in electrochemical nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of aliphatic alcohols.

Text:
Similarly, recent advances in catalytic electrochemical and photochemical methods also allowed the use of soluble organic 
bases.4,25,4661 For instance, Baran and coworkers reported an efficient electrochemical nickelcatalyzed crosscoupling of 
aliphatic alcohols using a bipyridine ligand and DBU, although this method was ineffective for aromatic alcohols.53,54 Johannes
