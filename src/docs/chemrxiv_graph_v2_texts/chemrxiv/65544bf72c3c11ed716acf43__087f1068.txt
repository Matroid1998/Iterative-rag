Description:
A molecule detected in TPD to analyze the density of edges and adatoms.

Raman 
spectroscopy has been used for the structure characterization of 
2D graphenes and 1D carbon nanotubes,2024 and it could also be 
applicable to the curved 3D analogues to provide insights into 
the structural disorders which breaks the translational symmetry, 
such as edges, defects, and grain boundaries of graphenerelated 
materials.2529 The TPD, based on the detection of desorbed mol
ecules including H2, CO, and CO2, rationalizes the density of 
edges and adatoms,17 while the XRD and nitrogen physisorption 
validate the number of graphene layers in the carbon materials.2 
We found that both the NPCs and NPGs mostly consist of 
singlelayered graphene with a few single vacancies and Stone
Wales defects. In addition, a significant healing of the surface
