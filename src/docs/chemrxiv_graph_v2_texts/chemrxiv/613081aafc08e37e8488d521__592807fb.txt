pores) and heteroatoms by design are researched 
to make up for the missing bandgap of graphene. Most notably 
transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene derivatives and 
designer covalent organic frameworks (COFs) compete to be the 
next generation semiconductor.812 
Graphitic carbon nitrides combine two important characteristics 
(i) they are overall sp2hybridised and covalently bonded, and (ii) 
they consist of earth abundant, light elements (i.e.
