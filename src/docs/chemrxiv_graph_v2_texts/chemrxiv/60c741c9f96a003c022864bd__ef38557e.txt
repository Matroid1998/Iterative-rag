Description:
Acts as a heteroatom in coordination with carbon to stabilize single-atom catalysts.

Text:
Singleatom catalysis has emerged as a novel approach to combine the singlesite nature of 
homogeneous catalysis with the robustness and technical readiness of heterogeneous catalysis.8
10 The socalled singleatom catalysts are monodispersed metal atomsions stabilized by a 
specific support, often via coordination to carbon and heteroatoms such as O, N, P, S, etc.8,9,11,12 
These catalysts are attractive because they exhibit maximum atomic efficiency and possess well
defined active sites, which facilitate mechanistic understanding.
