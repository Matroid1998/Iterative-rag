Description:
Frequently required as condensation agents in peptide synthesis.

Text:
To overcome this obstacle several scenarios 
for the emergence of peptides have been proposed, involving the 
presence of condensation agents and activated amino acid 
derivatives,2 dry heating,3 mechanochemical reaction conditions 
and nonaqueous reaction media,4 such as eutectic and sulfur 
dioxide (SO2) solutions.4b, 5 Metal and mineral catalysis under 
conditions that promote dehydration is another strategy to 
circumvent the constraints in aqueous solution.6 Although some 
remarkable peptide yields were obtained from these routes, the 
availability of frequently required condensation agents such as 
polyphosphates, imidazole, cyanates and cyanamides in 
sufficient 
concentrations 
on 
the 
early 
Earth 
is 
still 
controversial.6c, 7 Prebiotic peptide syntheses should be based 
on easily available reagents to ensure their compatibility with 
various scenarios. Iron as a highly abundant element on (early) 
Earth perfectly meets this requirement.
