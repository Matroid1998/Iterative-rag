Description:
Undergoes NH bond cleavage as the major dissociation pathway upon interaction with low energy electrons.

Text:
In particular, indirect interactions via low energy electrons have been implicated 
as a significant contributor to strand breakages.20, 21 These considerations have motivated electron 
scattering and photoionization studies of gas phase canonical and modified nucleobase species,22 
as the nucleobase is predicted to be the initial site of electron attachment.2326 Dissociative electron 
attachment (DEA) measurements show that the major product of interactions of nucleobases and 
low energy (3 eV) electrons is H loss from the base via NH bond ruptures.2731 DEA studies of 2
thiouracil (2TU) similarly show that NH bond cleavage accounts for the majority of dissociation
