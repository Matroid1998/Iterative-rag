Description:
Exhibit a cubic to rhombohedral transition caused by octahedral rotation around the 111 crystallographic direction.

1a) and this structure has been reported across the entire NbO2xF1x solid solution, ranging from x  0 
(NbVO2F) to x  2 (NbIIIF3).1315 Such ReO3type (oxy)fluorides are of wide interest, with a range of properties 
including lithium incorporation for battery applications16, 17 or negative thermal expansion as in ScF3.18 The 
latter property is linked to a cubic to rhombohedral transition apparent in many ReO3type trifluorides,1922 
caused by octahedral rotation around the 111 crystallographic direction (aaa in Glazers tilt notation).23 
Such a transition has also been observed in NbO2F under a relatively low hydrostatic pressure of 0.47 GPa 
(Fig. 1b).24
