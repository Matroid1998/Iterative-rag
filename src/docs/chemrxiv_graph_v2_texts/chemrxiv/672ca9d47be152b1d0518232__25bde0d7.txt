Description:
Formed in water microdroplets linked to ultrasonic humidifiers, ambient ozone, or dissolved oxygen.

Some of the im
portant variables driving the water microdroplet chemistry 
have been identified to be i) high intrinsic electric fields (up 
to 109 Vm) at the droplet surface,5, 22, 3236 ii) orientation of 
reactant(s) at the droplet surface,15 iii) partial solvation of 
reactant(s) at the airwater interface,3738 iv) droplet surface 
polarity or pH (aciditybasicity),1, 3944 v) confinement of re
actantsreagents in small volumes,4, 41, 4546 vi) evaporation 
of droplet and thereby sizes and associated lifetimes.4, 4756 
Besides the preceding factors, impurities like ozone or other 
reactive oxygen species at the microdroplet interface have 
been suggested to influence the interfacial chemistry in mi
crodroplets.5760 The origin of these impurities and reactive 
oxygen species, including H2O2, remains a topic of intense 
debate.57, 6068 Studies by Mishra and coworkers found no 
role of interfacial electric fields (IEF) in the formation of 
H2O2.57, 63 Instead, they suggested the origins of HO in wa
ter microdroplets is closely linked to the use of ultrasonic 
humidifiers, ambient ozone57 or dissolved oxygen.64 Zare 
and coworkers later affirmed that H2O2 can be formed in 
microdroplets in the absence of ozone, however, the quan
tity of H2O2 drops by two orders of magnititude.61 Besides, 
Colussi proposed that HO, consequently H2O2, are formed 
when partially hydrated HO and H ions at the surface of 
colliding charged microdroplets undergo exothermic elec
tron transfer.67 The HeadGordon group provided theoreti
cal supports to the role of electric field, partial solvation, 
and charges in microdroplet H2O2 chemistry.6566 
Several theoretical and computational works have 
shown the presence of large IEFs at the airwater interface
