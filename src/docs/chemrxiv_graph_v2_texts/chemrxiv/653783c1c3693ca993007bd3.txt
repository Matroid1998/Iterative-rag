Description:
An irreversible BTK inhibitor for treating CLL, MCL, and WM.

The Bcell malignancies include 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), Waldenstrms 
macroglobulinemia (WM), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large Bcell lymphoma 5. Recently, many studies have shown that BTK is the target for nonHodgkins lymphomas 
(NHL), specifically CLL, BCL, and autoimmune diseases 6. There are three marketed oral 
BTK inhibitors ibrutinib, zanubrutinib, and acalabrutinib 5. Ibrutinib is an irreversible BTK 
inhibitor for treating CLL, MCL, and WM 7. Zanubrutinib is used for adult patients with 
MCL after one prior therapy 8. Acalabrutinib is used for MCL, CLL, and small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL) 9. Some BTK inhibitors under study are branebrutinib, HM71224, 
DTRMWXHS12 DTRM, PRN1008, ONOGS4059, spebrutinib, and ARQ531 5. Oxindole is the scaffold of the compounds with potential clinical applications in drug discovery
