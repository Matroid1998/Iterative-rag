Description:
Small polar groups that mimic the spatial electronic properties of common functional groups and enhance binding through polarity and H-bonding properties.

Precise control of molecular properties and conformation 
is essential in drug discovery.1 Effective interactions with 
targeted biological sites require complementary electron 
density surfaces, modulated through combinations of polar, 
aromatic and hydrophobic sites. Small polar groups such as 
oxetanes,2 sulfoximines3 and phosphine oxides4 have 
emerged as valuable bioisosteres that mimic the spatial 
electronic properties of more common functional groups 
and potentially enhance binding through tailoring polarity 
and Hbonding properties. These groups are also beneficial 
in providing increased 3dimensionality and in influencing 
metabolic stability, solubility, absorption, distribution and 
pKa. Thus, these small polar motifs have provided genuine 
new design options to medicinal chemists.

Description:
Valuable replacements for carbonyl and gemdimethyl functionalities in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Oxetanes are a notable example of such a motif, with nine 
oxetane containing compounds currently in clinical trials 
(Figure 1a).2a Carreiras seminal studies established ox
etanes as valuable replacements for carbonyl and gemdi
methyl functionalities, expanding their medicinal chemistry 
potential by advancing the chemistry of oxetanone and ox
etaneMichael acceptors.5,6 We have demonstrated the 
Lewis and Brnsted acidcatalyzed formation of oxetane 
carbocations from oxetanols, facilitating trapping with 
arenes, thiols, and alcohols to generate 3,3disubstituted 
derivatives (Figure 1b).7,8 Very recently, Zhang and co
workers also developed a Lewis acid activation of oxetanyl 
trichloroacetimidates for the generation of oxetane carbo
cations.9 These advancements, along with the development 
of alternative electrophiles10,11 and other crosscoupling 
and radical processes,12 accentuate the significance of ox
etanes in drug discovery.13 
Similarly, azetidines are undergoing extensive investiga
tion and though less represented than their five and six
membered counterparts are rapidly gaining prominence in 
approved drugs (Figure 1a).14 Pioneering work by Baran 
stimulated the adoption of azabicyclo1.1.0butane (ABB) 
strainrelease reagents, enabling latestage azetidinylation 
of secondary amines (Figure 1b).15 Aggarwal leveraged 3
lithiated ABBs as nucleophiles in the modular synthesis of 
azetidine scaffolds.16,17 Radical processes18 and additions to 
alkylideneazetidines19 have been developed to generate 
valuable 3,3substiuted azetidine derivatives.
