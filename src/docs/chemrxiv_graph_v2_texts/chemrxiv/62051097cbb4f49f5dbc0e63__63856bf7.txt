Description:
Studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy.

In that work, the grown 
ZnO single crystals (up to several millimeters) exhibited strong luminescence in the UV and 
visible ranges. In the present work, the crystal growth method was adapted for growing a mixture 
of poly and single crystals of ZnO and Yb2O3, and the recovered samples were studied by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Xray diffraction and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS
