Description:
A broad-spectrum ribosome inhibitor originally produced by Xenorhabdus nematophila.

However, these mostly belong to 
already known compound classes or they are novel chemical 
entities attacking common targets, such as the broadspectrum 
ribosome 
inhibitor 
odilorhabdin, 
originally 
produced 
by 
Xenorhabdus nematophila.9 The darobactins, which are also 
produced by an entomopathogenic bacterium, Photorhabdus 
khanii,10 however, are some of the most promising new 
antibacterials in the last 50 years2 given they address a novel 
broadspectrum target in Gramnegative pathogens.
