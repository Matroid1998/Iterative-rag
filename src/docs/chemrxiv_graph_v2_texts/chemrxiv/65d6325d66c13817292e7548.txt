Description:
Drug molecules whose Gibbs energies of binding to cyclodextrin were calculated in SAMPL9.

Text:
For blind prediction of ligandreceptor Gibbs energies of 
binding, macrocyclic containers such as cucurbitnurils (CBn)9, 
10 and cyclodextrins (CDs)11, 12 with unreleased experimental 
data are sometimes chosen. Here, we systematically refine the calculated Gibbs energies of 
binding from SQM calculations for the drugs of abuse 
molecules to CB8 of the SAMPL8 hostguest challenge. This 
challenge focused on binding of this host to nine drug molecules 
including morphine, hydromorphone, methamphetamine, 
cocaine, and others (see Figure 1).13 It also included previously 
considered cycloheptanamine and cyclooctanamine (G8 and 
G9). Experimental data were obtained from Isothermal Titration 
(ITC) and NMR spectroscopy.14 
In addition, we address the calculation of Gibbs energies of 
binding of phenothiazine drug molecules to the cyclodextrin 
receptor, which was part of SAMPL9.
