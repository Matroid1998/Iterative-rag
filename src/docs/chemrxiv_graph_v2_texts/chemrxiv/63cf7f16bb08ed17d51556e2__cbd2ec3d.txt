Description:
Saturated bioisosteres of the parasubstituted phenyl ring.

. The phenyl ring is a basic structural element in 
chemistry, and we learn about it already in school in a general 
chemistry class. It is one of the most popular structural motifs in 
natural products and bioactive compounds. 1 Moreover, more 
than five hundred drugs contain a fragment of paradisubstituted 
benzene,2 including the wellknown to everyone Paracetamol. However, organic compounds with more than two phenyl rings 
often suffer from poor solubility and low metabolic stability.3,4 

Scheme 1. Bicyclo1.1.1pentanes, bicyclo2.2.2octanes, and cubane as 
saturated bioisosteres of the parasubstituted phenyl ring. In 2012, however, Stepan and colleagues showed that a 
replacement of the central phenyl ring in a secretase inhibitor 
with the bicyclo1.1.1pentane improved its physicochemical 
properties and retained bioactivity (Scheme 1).
