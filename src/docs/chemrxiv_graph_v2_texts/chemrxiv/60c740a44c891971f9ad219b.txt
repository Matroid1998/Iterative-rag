Description:
A polymer whose crystallization can be studied using molecular dynamics simulations.

While there has
been some work715 probing the molecularlevel details of polymer crystallization using
simulations, it relied on isothermal simulations, and neglected the role of heat transfer
during polymer crystallization. It remains an open challenge to characterize the impact of
heat release on polymer nucleation. The present study addresses this challenge through NPT, NVT, and NVE molecular
dynamics simulations of crystal nucleation in entangled polyethylene (PE) melts,
specically nC720H1442 melts. During an isochoric, isothermal NVT simulation, the heat
released during crystallization is removed nearly instantaneously from the crystallizing
system (e.g., on picosecond timescales). In an isolated (NVE) simulation, heat is unable
to escape the system as it crystallizes. NVT and NVE simulations thus represent the two
extremes that bound experimentally relevant heatdissipation conditions.
