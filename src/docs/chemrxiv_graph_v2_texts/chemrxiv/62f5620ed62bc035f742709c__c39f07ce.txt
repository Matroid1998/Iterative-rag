Description:
Stable crystalline compounds that can be ligated with a diverse array of NHCs to fine-tune properties.

boroncentered radicals where 
the boron atom is coordinated with a suitable Lewis base, 
are more stable and provide a suitable entry for use in rad
ical chemistry (Figure 1A).9,10 
In particular, Nheterocyclic carbenebased (NHC) bo
ranes are emerging as a useful LBR class NHC boranes are 
stable crystalline compounds and a diverse array of NHCs 
can be ligated to boranes allowing to finetune the LBR 
properties.11 Notably, these LBRs can be uniquely paired 
with photocatalysis to generate the targeted boroncen
tered radicals.12 Herein, a photocatalyst absorbs visible light 
and engages with the ligated borane in a singleelectron 
transfer step, which, upon deprotonation, generates the 
corresponding boryl radical.
