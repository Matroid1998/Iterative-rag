Description:
Combined with silicon precursors in the synthesis of amorphous TiSiO2 nanoparticles.

Text:
The particle size can be 
tuned by varying the temperature and crystallization 
time, whereas the porosity is typically controlled in the 
mesoporous range by the addition of templates  e.g. organosilanes  that prevent the fusion of the 
crystallites, or by leveraging on the grinding and drying 
steps of the gel prior to autoclaving 32. Alternatively, 
Schwieger and coworkers showed that mesoporous 
silica and aluminosilicate nanoparticles could be used 
both as hard template and precursors in the synthesis of 
micromacroporous silicalite and ZSM5 by SAC, 
respectively 33,34. Herein, we propose to combine titanium and 
silicon precursors in the synthesis of amorphous Ti
SiO2 nanoparticles and to use the latters in the 
preparation of hierarchical TS1 material featuring both 
a micromacroporosity and large crystal size.

Description:
Incorporated into precursor material for crystallization into a hierarchical TS1 catalyst.

Text:
To the 
best of our knowledge, the incorporation of titanium in 
such precursor material and its further crystallization 
into fully functional hierarchical TS1 catalyst by SAC 
has never been reported. We aim to demonstrate that 
controlling the incorporation of titanium during the 
preparation of the precursor particles prior to the 
thermal treatment allows obtaining TS1 presenting 
both proper Ti speciation in the MFItype structure and 
a 
secondary 
intracrystalline 
macroporosity. The 
successful conversion of the amorphous material into 
crystalline TS1 is exploited in the catalytic conversion 
of allyl alcohol into glycidol in water, and compared to 
the benchmark microporous TS1 catalyst. 2. Experimental
