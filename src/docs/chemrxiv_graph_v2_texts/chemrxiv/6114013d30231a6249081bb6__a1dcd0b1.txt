Description:
Used in the form of aromatic moieties or dots for sensitization with light harvesting compounds.

Firstly, modified synthetic protocols aim at 
incorporating additional light absorbing moieties already during the synthesis of PCN, for 
example, by introducing sulfur species4, aromatic carbon moieties,5 creating co
polymeric precursors with other Ncontaining molecules,6 or by varying the 
condensation conditions, especially the temperature7 or reaction medium composition.8 
Secondly, postsynthetic approaches comprise chemical surface modification of 
conventional PCN, for instance, by hydrogenation or oxidation,9 sensitization with light 
harvesting compounds such as organic dyes10, carbon dots or fullerenes,11 or various 
forms of postsynthetic thermal treatment.12 
Although the condensation of PCN precursors at high temperatures (above 600 C)7 
and the postsynthetic annealing of PCNs under similar conditions12 might seem very 
similar, the essential difference lies in the lower ammonia gas evolution from the material 
in the latter case.
