Description:
A molecule involved in oxidation to methanol.

Text:
One approach is to screen large libraries of molecules that are structurally similar to the known
catalyst. For example Nandy et al. combined machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT)
methods to screen a library of 16 million candidates for the catalysis of the methane to methanol oxidation.1
Another recent example of computationally driven catalyst optimization from Cramer et al. used mech
anistic information of three intertwined catalytic cycles for CO2 conversion to formic acid, formaldehyde
and methanol to generate theoretically founded rules for predicting catalytic activity and selectivity.2 The
theoretical framework was used to predict a catalyst that optimizes selectivity towards formaldehyde, which
was verified experimentally with an 81 yield. Das et al.
