Description:
Can host thermally activated polarons that display semiconductor-like conductivity.

Text:
Thermally activated polarons can hop to neighboring Ti
ions and would display semiconductorlike conductivity in the
bulk phase.22 However, a more recent study using INS and den
sity functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the extra
electron is more likely to delocalize among all Ti 3dbands gener
ating a bandstate with metallic electrical conductivity.23 Several
investigations on the oxyhydride with solidstate nuclear mag
netic resonance (NMR) have also proposed that the electronic
structure is more likely a bandstate.2426 In contrast to other re
ports Misaki and coworkers25 suggested that the hydride site is
occupied by two hydrogens. Here we report a comprehensive study of hydride local en
vironment and dynamics by employing 2H solidstate NMR on
three distinctly prepared BaTiO3xHy oxyhydrides with different
hydride compositions.
