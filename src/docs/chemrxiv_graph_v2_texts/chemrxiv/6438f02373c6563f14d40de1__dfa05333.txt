Description:
A 2D transition metal oxide with a polycrystalline network that is 4.5 Ã… thick.

Early trials with 
electrochemical growth of Pd into graphene layers yielded promising results with thin Pd sheets 
of 5 nm thickness.39 It is thus compelling to wonder which thickness can be achieved in 
bottomup electrochemical synthesis of 2D nonvdW materials via space confinement. Here, we firstly report a controlled electrochemical method to obtain (sub) unit cell thick 2D 
transition metal oxides, like Cr2O3, Fe2O3, by using the angstromconfinement of stacked 
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers. The 2D holey polycrystalline network of Cr2O3 and 
Fe2O3 is only 4.5  and 5.4  thick respectively.

Description:
A high performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in its 2D form.

Text:
The material is homogenously distributed 
within the 2.5 cm2 x 500 nm rGO film.37,38 As an example of the unexpected properties of 
these electrochemically synthesised 2D materials, we find that the 2D form of Cr2O3 is a high 
performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, in contrast to its low performing bulk 
form4042. Although this class of 2D nonvdW materials is still vastly unexplored due to 
limited synthesis routes,26,43,44 2D metal oxides are expected to hold a wide range of 
interesting properties and possible applications. With that a new and easily accessible route for 
obtaining subunit cell thick 2D metaloxides is unlocked.
