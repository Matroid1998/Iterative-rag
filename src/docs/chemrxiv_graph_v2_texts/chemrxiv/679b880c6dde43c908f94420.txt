Description:
Used in doping to enhance the photocatalytic performance of titanium dioxide.

Text:
The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a scalable and efficient solution for 
one of the most pressing environmental and public health challenges. By employing a ternary 
doping strategy, the photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic performance compared 
to undoped titanium dioxide. The introduction of boron, cerium, and silver synergistically
