Description:
A material used in UV devices and graphene technology.

Text:
Epitaxially grown hexagonal and rhombohedral boron nitride (hBN1 and rBN2) 
thin films are materials that have various applications in the fields of UV devices 36 and 
graphene technology710. Similarly, other less ordered crystalline forms of BN including 
turbostatic BN (tBN) and amorphous BN (aBN) are studied to understand film 
nucleation, and have potential electronic applications as dielectrics.11,12 Thin film growth 
of sp2hybridized boron nitride (sp2BN) is typically done using chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD). Growth of epitaxial sp2BN thin films requires high growth 
temperatures, above 1200 C1317, which is a limiting factor for the substrates that can be 
used.
