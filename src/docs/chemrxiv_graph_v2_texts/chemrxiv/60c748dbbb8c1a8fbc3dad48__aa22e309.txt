Description:
An FDA approved serine-threonine protein kinase BRaf inhibitor used in the treatment of melanoma.

Text:
Other inhibitor types include allosteric inhibitors (type 3), substratedirected 
inhibitors (type 4) and covalent inhibitors (type 5).9 
There are many heterocyclic hinge binding pharmacophores found in kinase inhibitors, some of which are considered 
privileged fragments.10, 11 One versatile example is the 7azaindole core (Figure 1  1) which is employed as the hinge 
binder in vemurafenib (2), an FDA approved serinethreonineprotein kinase BRaf (BRaf) inhibitor used in the 
treatment of melanoma.12 Azaindoles are excellent hinge binders, making two hydrogen bonds with the kinase hinge 
region.
