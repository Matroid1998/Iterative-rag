Description:
Formed as a radical species from benzaldehyde through hydrogen abstraction.

Text:
The current knowledge on photogeneration of radical species in 
benzaldehyde solutions was recently summarized in a review by Kokotos et al.23 It was also 
observed that the UVexcited benzaldehyde triplet state can be effectively quenched by triplet
state energy acceptors,24 and when dissolved in a good hydrogen donor it can perform 
hydrogen abstraction leading to the formation hydroxybenzyl radical in general,25, 26 or of 
diols in the presence of alcohols.21 Arcas et al. provided further insight into the autooxidation 
processes in benzyl alcoholbenzaldehyde systems, claiming the formation of singlet oxygen 
being responsible for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with concomitant
