Description:
A carbon-based conductive additive used in FIB electrodes.

In this work, they used La0.9Ba0.1F2.9 as a solid 
electrolyte in combination with composite conversiontype electrode materials MFyM, where 
the latter converts between the metal state M and the metal fluoride state MFy within the 
electrochemical reaction. Since this initial demonstration, a wider range of electrolytes and 
electrodes have been explored. This has included liquid and polymer electrolytes 4 as well as 
intercalationbased electrodes5. Despite this progress, challenges with electrode stability are 
often observed. Almost universally, FIB electrodes contain a carbonbased conductive additive (e.g., acetylene 
black, carbon black, or carbon nanotubes).
