6,7 however proposed
the existence of stable cisuranyl structures in uranyl dihydroxides and tetracoordinated
UO2X42 (X  F, Cl, and OH) complexes, with Oyl UOyl bond angles as acute as 100. In both linear and bent structures, the yl oxygen atoms carry negative charges making them
Lewis bases, with a basicity that increases pairwise with ylbond weakening as stronger Lewis
basis are coordinated in the uranyl equatorial plane.8,9
There have been several attempts to synthesize bent actinyl complexes. A simple syn
thetic route was proposed by Schne et al. 10, in which simply dropping 1,10 phenanthroline
(phen) into a uranyl chloride solution in acetone forms the UO2Cl2(phen)2 complex, in which
the uranyl group is strongly bent (161.8(1)), and consequently the equatorial plane is broken
up. Langer et al.
