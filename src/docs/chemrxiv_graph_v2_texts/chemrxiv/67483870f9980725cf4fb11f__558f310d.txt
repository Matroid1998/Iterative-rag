Description:
Obtained from water electrolysis of water ice on the Martian surface.

A 
16 
reasonable and planned step is ISRU in the case of propellant production on Mars from CO2 of the 
17 
Martian atmosphere and H2 from water electrolysis of water ice from the Martian surface 5. However, 
18 
some highperformance materials cannot be produced on site. In these cases, the shippedin resources 
19 
should be recyclable in order to cease the costly transport as efficient as possible 6, which makes the 
20 
choice of stable and unreactive Fluoropolymers reasonable. 21 
Reaction engineering is crucial in designing highly integrated and efficient processes for optimal 
22 
utilization of weight, resources and time. The unique challenges of extraterrestrial sites like Mars or 
23 
permanent space stations equally pose unique opportunities to reevaluate reaction engineering of already 
24 
well understood reactions.
