Description:
Reacts with lithium titanate spinel at 1.55 V vs. Li metal, avoiding dangerous Li metal deposition.

Safe, durable, high power batteries are necessary for vehicular energy storage in, e.g., passenger 
vehicles, buses, and warehouse vehicles, where they can assist with acceleration, regenerative 
braking, and rapid charging. Fast recharge, without accelerated cell degradation, is also important 
for portable electronics, ebikes and escooters, and frequencystabilization at the grid scale. Lithium titanate spinel (Li4Ti5O12) is used as an anode in stateoftheart, commercial highrate 
batteries because it reacts with lithium at 1.55 V vs. Li metal, thus avoiding the propensity for 
coulombically inefficient and potentially dangerous Li metal deposition on the anode under high 
charging current densities.
