Description:
Radicals studied in this work, corresponding to hydrogen abstractions that isobutanol can undergo.

Text:
Figure 1 shows the peroxy radicals studied in this work,
which correspond to the three most predominant hydrogen
abstractions that isobutanol can undergo. The alkoxy radical
formed from hydrogen abstraction of isobutanol by OH is ex
pected to be much less common13 and is not included in this
work. For each of the three isomers studied, various unimolec
ular reactions can occur, as shown in Figure 2. The peroxy
radicals (RO2) can isomerize through intramolecular hydro
