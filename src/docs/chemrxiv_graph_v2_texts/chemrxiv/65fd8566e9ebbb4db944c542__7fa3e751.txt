Description:
A renewable building block widely used in polyester synthesis.

Polyesters are materials that 
offer versatility, chemical resistance, and ease of processing, making them suitable for a wide 
range of applications. They exhibit good dimensional stability, mechanical properties, and UV 
stability, while their recyclability and aesthetic options make them highly desirable in industries 
such as textiles, packaging, and automotive (4,5). Polyesters have been developed using a 
variety of compounds derived from biomass, such as building blocks or monomers (6,7). Adipic 
acid and its derivatives as well as aliphatic linear diols such as 1,4  butanediol which were 
specifically used in this work are one of the top renewable building blocks which have been 
widely used in polyester synthesis (812).
