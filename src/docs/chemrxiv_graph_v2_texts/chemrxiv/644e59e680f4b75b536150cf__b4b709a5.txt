Description:
An unsubstituted compound used in copolymerization with functional epoxide.

Text:
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a synthetic polymer that is 
hydrophilic and has a wide range of applications in various fields, including energy harvesting 
devices, everyday consumables, and specialized medical treatments.14 Researchers have 
shown an interest in functionalized PEO that possesses both the desirable characteristics of 
PEO and functional molecules. For example, the attachment of biologically relevant molecules 
at the ends of PEG chains, known as PEGylation, has been used to impact medicines such as 
the recent COVID19 vaccines.57 
Connecting functional molecules to PEO presents a synthetic challenge (Scheme 
1).810 While copolymerization of ethylene oxide and functional epoxide has been pursued to 
introduce functionality on PEO chains (Scheme 1A), the inherent steric and electronic 
difference between unsubstituted ethylene oxide (EO) and substituted epoxide makes efficient 
copolymerizations difficult.
