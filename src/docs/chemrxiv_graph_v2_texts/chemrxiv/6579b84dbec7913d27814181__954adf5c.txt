Description:
Each Mo atom is intricately coordinated by six neighboring chalcogen atoms, forming strong covalent bonds.

Text:
This tunability directly stems from their hexagonal symmetry
structure, where each Mo atom is intricately coordinated by six neigh
boring chalcogen atoms (S, Se, or Te), forming strong covalent bonds
and adopting a trigonalprismatic geometry through the hybridization
of molybdenums sd5 orbitals. This structural arrangement results in
a lack of coordinatively unsaturated surface sites, rendering the basal
planes of materials like MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 generally chemi
cally inert, with most external interactions primarily driven by van der
Waals (vdW) forces. Moreover, the distinctive bonding configuration in
these sheets results in the outwardprojecting pz orbitals of chalcogen
atoms contributing to the valence band maximum (VBM). This feature
enables effective charge transfers, even in cases where surface interac
tions are relatively weak 18, 19.
