Description:
Radicals with the unpaired electron centred in a nitro group that delocalises in the system of an arene.

Nitrogencentred radicals (NCRs) offer a very versatile toolkit in organic chemistry. Thanks to their 
varying degree of stability1 and multiple generation schemes,2 they have found a wide range of applications 
as intermediates in novel synthetic pathways,35 platforms for obtaining persistent highspin 
(poly)radicals,68 frustrated Lewis pairs,9,10 and frustrated radical pairs.11,12 Moreover, their relevance goes 
wellbeyond chemistry, extending to medicine with NCRs being key drug components,13 and chemical 
biology, where reactive nitrogen species participate in a number of metabolic processes.14 
Among NCRs, nitroarene radicals, with the unpaired electron centred in a nitro group that delocalises 
in the system of an arene, are species of particular importance in multiple chemical transformations.
