Description:
React with the surface of catalysts to generate hyperactive soluble Pd(II) complexes in cross-coupling reactions.

From polymeric arylations1 through valued pharmaceutical 
ingredients,2 numerous valued fine chemicals and advanced 
materials can be synthesized carrying out the catalytic reaction 
within the inner porosity of solgel entrapped glassy catalysts.3,4 

According to Farina and de Vries writing in late 2015, the fine 
chemical industry does not use immobilized transition metal 
complexes as catalysts, due to poor catalyst stability resulting in 
metal leaching and product contamination.5 

In a series of papers published since the early 2010s, Ananikovs 
and Beletskayas teams reported the discovery that most catalytic 
reactions mediated by noble metal nanoparticles, metal salts and 
metal complexes in liquid phase actually involve a cocktailtype 
of catalysis in which solid nanoparticles, metal clusters in solution, 
and soluble metal complexes formed upon leaching all take part 
in catalytic cycles.6,7 

In the case of a organosilicaentrapped palladium complex solgel 
catalyst, indeed, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis 
are involved.8 In crosscoupling reactions, for example, substrates 
such as iodoaryls react with the surface of the catalyst to 
generate hyperactive soluble Pd(II) complexes that, even though 
present in trace amounts, are responsible for the catalysis 
observed.9 

Still, the amount of metal leached is so low to make leaching not 
relevant from a practical viewpoint.
