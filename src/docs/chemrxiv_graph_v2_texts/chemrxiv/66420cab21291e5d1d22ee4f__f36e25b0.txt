Description:
Compounds that condense with aldehydes and activated acetonitriles in the Gewald reaction.

Text:
First reported 
in 1962,811 the Gewald reaction has been used productively since and has four distinct iterations, each 
offering unique advantages.6, 1215 These iterations include (i) the condensation of mercaptoketones or 
aldehydes with activated acetonitriles, in the presence of a basic catalyst like triethylamine or piperidine 
in ethanol, N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF), dioxane or water at 50 C; (ii) a onepot multicomponent 
reaction of carbonyl compounds with activated acetonitriles and elemental sulfur in the presence of 
amines such as diethylamine, morpholine, or triethylamine.

Description:
Involved in the cyclization of activated nitriles.

Text:
Some of the key nitrile components include 
malononitrile, cyanoacetic esters, cyanoacetamides, and cyanoacetophenones.16 The preferred solvents 
are ethanol, DMF, dioxane, or neat for some carbonyl compounds; (iii) a twopot reaction that involves an 
unsaturated nitrile (KnoevenagelCope condensation product) with elemental sulfur and (iv) an 
improved version of (i) involving the cyclization of activated nitriles with dimers of mercaptoketones 
or aldehydes. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20243lq16 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000205467537 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
