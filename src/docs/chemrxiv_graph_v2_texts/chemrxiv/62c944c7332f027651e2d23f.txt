Description:
One of the most abundant biomolecules in nature and the backbone of many existing drugs and alkaloids.

Text:
Indole is one of the most abundant biomolecules in nature. Indole derivatives such as mela
tonin and serotonin serve crucial roles in several biological processes, including neurotrans
mitter, pigments, sleep, mood, aggression and learning.13 On the other hand, another indole
derivative, tryptophan is one of the essential amino acids that are the building blocks of pro
tein.4 Anomalies in their functions can lead to depression, anxiety, infantile autism, insomnia,
sleeprelated issues, and protein malfunction.57 Moreover, the indole group is the backbone
of many existing drugs and alkaloids.8
Study of photophysics and photochemistry of indole and its derivatives builds the foundation
of understanding lightinduced phenomena of indole chromophore.

Description:
The aromatic ring acts as a chromophore.

Text:
Several experimental and
theoretical studies have been performed on indole and its derivatives.912 The aromatic ring
of indole acts as a chromophore, and the photochemical and photophysical properties of its
derivatives vary with the adjacent substituent groups.10 The versatility and abundance of
indole derivatives have drawn chemists attention for decades. 2
