Description:
Used by ribosomes to support bond forming reactions.

Text:
Thioesters are ubiquitous and wellstudied reactive species in biosynthesis. For example, 
the active sites of polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases leverage 
enhanced thioester reactivity to promote challenging condensation reactions that form new CN, 
CO and CC bonds. The markedly higher reaction rates of thioesters compared to oxoesters 
with various nucleophiles has been rationalized by electron delocalization effects.13 By contrast, 
all extant ribosomes employ oxoesters to support bond forming reactions, despite the 
observation that thioesters are generally more reactive towards amine nucleophiles.1,2 During 
translation, thioesters could in principle substitute for oxoesters if tRNA substrates carried an SH 
in place of OH on the 3terminal ribose.
