Description:
Involved in homogeneous polymerization catalyzed by transition metal and alkyl compounds.

Text:
Chain transfer reactions between compounds of transition metals 
and alkyls, haloalkanes of Group II  III metals play an important 
role in the catalysis of homogeneous polymerization of olefins 1, 
2. A special place among chain transfer reactions is occupied by the 
exchange reactions of zirconocene complexes and organoaluminum 
compounds of various structures. Despite the low activity of these 
systems in polymerization reactions, they are important for organic 
and organometallic chemistry. Ligand exchange between 
metallocene dichloride and organoaluminum compounds  based 
systems 
underlies 
the 
generation 
of 
hydride 
and 
alkyl 
organometallic complexes initiating the reactions of hydro, carbo 
and cyclometalation of alkynes and alkenes. Functionally 
substituted products of hydrometalation and carbometalation 
obtained in situ are important synthons for the organometallic 
synthesis of various classes of organic molecules 3.
