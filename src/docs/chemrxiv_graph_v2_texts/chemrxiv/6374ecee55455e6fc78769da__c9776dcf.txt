Description:
A constrained compound that, when subjected to reaction conditions, shows a significant drop in selectivity.

3A) this revealed that a variety of modifications could be accommodated. High 
yields and levels of enantioselectivity were generally observed with parasubstituted substrates 
(15, e.r. 9010 to 982), and single crystal Xray analysis of enantioenriched 1 enabled the absolute 
configuration to be assigned as (S). In the solid state, an 84 offset between the planes of geminal 
phenyl groups was observed. To explore if this phenomenon is important in the transfer of chiral 
information, constrained fluorene cyclopropane 6 was subjected to the reaction conditions and a 
significant drop of selectivity (e.r. 7030) was observed. In contrast, metasubstitution was well 
tolerated, generating 7 in 85 yield and with an e.r. of 9010.
