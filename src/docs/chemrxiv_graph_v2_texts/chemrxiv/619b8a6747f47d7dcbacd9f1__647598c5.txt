Description:
Prepared through environmentally friendly catalytic hydrogenation methods.

However, the production process of the first two 
methods usually produces harmful substances, including metal salt slag and sulfur
containing wastewater 57, and such processes are affected by equipment corrosion and 
environmental pollution which are gradually replaced by more gentle procedures. Catalytic hydrogenation is an environmentally friendly method for preparing halogenated 
anilines. So far, the catalysts used for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene are mainly 
noble Pt, Pd, Ru based catalysts, and some other nonnoble Ni, Co and Fe based 
catalysts814. In the case of hydrogen as the hydrogen donor, some precious metals are 
often used for direct hydrogenation of nitroaromatics under high temperature and high 
pressure15,16.
