Description:
Compounds involved in radical reactions studied for their novel chemical reactivities.

Text:
After many years of neglection in synthetic 
laboratories, radical chemistry receives growing 
attention, offering the novel types of chemical 
reactivities.1,2 In particular, radical reactions of alkenyl 
boronates have been studied in numerous works 
previously. One of the possible reaction pathways 
include radical addition with preservation of the 
boronate moiety (Scheme 1, A). These transformations 
have been discussed thoroughly in several review 
articles36 and typically include atom transfer  radical 
addition (ATRA).7,8 The process starts with Giesetype 
radical addition to the double bond providing boryl 
radical.

Description:
React with bromodifluoroacetate via the ATRA pathway to provide haloboronates.

Text:
The high importance of fluorinated compounds in 
medicinal chemistry and beyond implies a constant 
need for novel Fluorinecontaining chemotypes and 
synthesis thereof.3238 In this area, bromodifluoroacetic 
acid and its derivatives have been known for a long 
time as a valuable CF2 unit source applicable to a 
variety of transformations.3942 To date, the known 
reactivity of bromodifluoroacetate 1 towards boronic 
derivatives has been mostly described for aromatic 
substrates and included Suzukitype CC coupling 
reactions.4347 On the contrary, alkenyl boronates 2 
have been known to react with compound 1 via the 
ATRA pathway providing haloboronates of type 3 
(Scheme 2, A).9,48,49 In this work, we for the first time 
demonstrate an alternative reactivity profile for 
substrates 1 and 2 resulting in ipsosubstitution of the 
boroncontaining moiety (Scheme 2, B).
