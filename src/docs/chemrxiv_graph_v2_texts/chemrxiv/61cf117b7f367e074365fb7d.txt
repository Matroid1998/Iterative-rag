Description:
Components of DNA that interact with low-energy electrons (LEE) affecting DNA damage mechanisms.

Text:
The outcome of DEA process highly depends
on the energy and lifetime of the attached electron, i.e., it determines fragmentation or
nondissociative relaxation mechanism.810 To get a better understanding of the mechanisms
responsible for DNA damage by LEE via DEA, we need to acquire more knowledge on the in
teraction of LEE with nucleobases.11 Studying the mechanism causing DNA damage has been
of great interest in the experimental and theoretical science communities, however, showing
various processes with very dierent energy values.1218 Therefore, an abinitio treatment is
needed. Such a treatment can help to explain the interaction of resonances with light (as it
is necessary to calculate complex transition dipole in order to understand such interaction).
