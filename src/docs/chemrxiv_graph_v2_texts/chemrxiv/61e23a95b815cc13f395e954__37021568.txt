Volatile compounds that endow fruity attributes and varietal characters in wines.

These changes tend to be 
24 
harmful to the overall aroma of white wines, as important volatiles such as esters and varietal thiols that endow 
25 
fruity attributes and varietal characters could be easily compromised.56 However, the focus of ageingrelated 
26 
oxidative studies of wine aroma is on the changes that occur after prolonged storage for months or years, 
27 
whereas the rapid oxidation events that occur in wine within several weeks of its exposure to an oxygenrich 
28 
atmosphere are not as widely studied. 29 
An indirect perspective to approach this rarely researched phenomenon is the consumption rates of oxygen in 
30 
O2enriched wine. For instance, Ferreira et al.

Description:
Wine aroma compounds potentially affected by oxidation-related reactions.

Text:
Undesirable sulfurcontaining volatiles such as 2furanmethanthiol and 
42 
hydrogen sulfide may similarly react with quinones and form odorless quinonevolatile adducts, although with 
43 
slowers reaction rates.10 Also, Ferreira et al. tentatively identified the increased levels of some volatile phenols 
44 
as the endproducts of polyphenol oxidation using SPEGCMS.8 These studies illustrate how oxidation in wines 
45 
occurs rapidly following contact with oxygen, which is accompanied by a series of sensory alterations involving 
46 
aroma loss and formation. 47 
However, it remains unclear whether other important wine aroma compounds, such as esters, are so readily 
48 
affected by oxidationrelated reactions in wines exposed to air for a short time.
