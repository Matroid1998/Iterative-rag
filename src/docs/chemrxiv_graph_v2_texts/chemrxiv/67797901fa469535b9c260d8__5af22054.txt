Description:
Thermal-responsive bonds utilized in dynamic and reversible chemistry for debonding and recycling adhesives.

Text:
From consumer electronics to aerospace, adhesives play an essential role in modern society. While the global adhesives market reaches 92.6 billion dollars 1, 122 billion dollars including 
sealants 2, in 2024, its reliance on irreversible thermoset systems presents environmental and 
economic challenges, including material waste and limited to nonrecyclability 3. Addressing these challenges, researchers have utilized dynamic and reversible chemistry to 
demonstrate debondingondemand and recycling adhesives, focusing on thermalresponsive 
bonds such as disulfides 48, hydroxy esters 912, or DielsAlder 13,14 or photoresponsive bonds
