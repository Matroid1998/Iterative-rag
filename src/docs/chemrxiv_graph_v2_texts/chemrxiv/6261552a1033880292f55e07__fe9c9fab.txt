Description:
Mentioned alongside parahydrogen in the context of MR signal enhancement.

Text:
Parahydrogeninduced polarization (PHIP) is another quickly 
developing HP method.13,14 Here, the spin order of 
parahydrogen (pH2) is used to enhance the MR signal of 
dedicated contrast agents. pH2 and orthohydrogen (oH2) are the
