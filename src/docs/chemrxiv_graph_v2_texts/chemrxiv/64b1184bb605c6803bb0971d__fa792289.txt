Description:
Emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the power sector account for nearly 50% of energy-related CO2 emissions globally.

Text:
Complying with the ambitious aims of the Paris Agreement will require a portfolio of 
greenhouse gas reduction and mitigation measures that will support the global transition 
to netzero emissions. The International Energy Agency has reported that fossil fuel 
combustion in the power sector alone accounted for nearly 50 of energyrelated CO2 
emissions at the global scale. It is because coal is still an important fuel source for power 
generation, accounting for about 38 of the global power generation fleet 1. Unfortunately, the demand for coal is still on an increase, achieving an alltime high of 8 
billion tonnes per year in 2021.

Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for emission reductions through carbon capture and storage technologies.

Text:
Substantial growth in coal demand was driven by 
developments in the power sector and switching from natural gas to coal, due to a 
significant surge in gas prices, in India, China and the European Union, despite 
substantial reductions in the United States 2. Therefore, the decarbonisation of coal
fired power plants is more critical now than ever. Implementation of carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS) is expected to provide a substantial driving force for the 
decarbonisation of the power sector, accounting for about 15 of cumulative CO2 
emission reductions by 2070 3. Solventbased chemical scrubbing technology is currently the technology of choice in 
power CCUS projects 4, as it has been commercially demonstrated 5.
