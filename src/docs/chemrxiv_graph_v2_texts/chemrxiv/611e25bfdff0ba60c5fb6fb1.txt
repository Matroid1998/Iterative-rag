Description:
Requires a liner or seed layer to promote continuous film deposition.

Text:
Copper (Cu) has been used in the semiconductor industry as the interconnect material for over 20 
years.1 However, the continuous deposition of conducting Cu films in the small and complex 
structures of present and future nanoelectronic device structures is, and will become more difficult. Copper requires a liner or seed layer to promote continuous film deposition. This layer is in 
addition to the barrier layer, which prevents the diffusion of Cu into the dielectric layer and Si 
substrates.2 As device dimensions shrink and more complex structures emerge, the volume 
available for copper interconnects at the transistor levels becomes correspondingly smaller and 
must accommodate the barrier, the liner and copper.

Description:
Preferentially aggregates into high resistivity 3D island structures at the nanoscale.

Text:
From a more general perspective, it is well known that at the nanoscale, Cu will preferentially 
aggregate into high resistivity 3D island structures.34 One solution to these issues is to replace 
copper with alternative metals that do not suffer from these issues. In this regard, the early 
transition metal Cobalt (Co) is of high interest as alternative material for replacing Cu in next
