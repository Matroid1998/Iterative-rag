The development of bioconjugation techniques has be
come a cornerstone for the advancement of chemical prote
omics1, biomaterial synthesis2, biomolecular imaging3, 
singlemolecule analysis4, singlecell multiomics5 and 
multispecific drugs6. Despite the emergence of bioconjuga
tion reactions that utilize different natural and unnatural 
amino acids in protein molecules7, cysteine (Cys)specific 
conjugation remains the most widely used strategy for na
tive protein modification8. This is due to the unique nucle
ophilicity and the low natural abundance of Cys residues, 
which provides opportunities for rapid and selective pro
tein modifications9. Various types of reactions have been 
reported to specifically label Cys in proteins, including al
kylation10, arylation11 and Michael additions12. Among 
these, Michael addition appears a more favorable chemistry 
in application due to its fast reaction kinetics in aqueous 
buffer.
