Copper (Cu) is the first metal to be manipulated by man 1. In previous years, Cu has been 
used in domestic tools such as axes, military weaponry, and alloy of other metals such as brass, 
bronze, and others 2. In recent times and a more pronounced sense, Cu is used in building 
materials, jewelry, electrical contacts and conductors, industrial machinery, nutritional 
supplements, fungicides in agriculture, and making alloys 3. Although Cu is sourced mainly 
from primary mining of ore deposits, secondary mining from sources like printed circuit boards 
(PCBs) is gaining attention as it is a more environmentally friendly option than primary mining 
4. Popular methods employed for secondary Cu recovery include pyrometallurgy 5, 
hydrometallurgy 6, biohydrometallurgy 7, and electrochemical recovery 8.
