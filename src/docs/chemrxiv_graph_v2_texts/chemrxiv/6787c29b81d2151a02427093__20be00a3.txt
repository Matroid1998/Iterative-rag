Description:
Promotes the formation of ethanol with Rh-based catalysts.

Text:
Taken together with catalytic studies and detailed in situ or operando 
spectroscopic investigations, molecularlevel structureactivity relationships and guideline 
principles can be elaborated, thus providing opportunities for rational catalyst development. Our group has successfully implemented this approach to explore and understand various 
heterogeneous catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation,21,22 selective oxidation of methane 
23 and CO2 hydrogenation.20,24,25 
Considering the unique ability of Fe to promote the formation of ethanol with Rhbased
