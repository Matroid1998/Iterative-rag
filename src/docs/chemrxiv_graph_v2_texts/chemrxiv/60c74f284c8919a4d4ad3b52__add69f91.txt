Description:
A niobium MAX phase compound with a distinct crystallographic structure.

Text:
Both material 
families 
have 
extremely 
diverse 
applications MAX phases are used for 
industrial components such as heating 
elements and gas burner nozzles with high 
temperature applications1,3,6 and MXenes are being tested as functional materials for 
applications in energy storage,7,8 hydrogen9,10 and oxygen11,12 evolution catalysis, cancer 
therapeutics,13 electromagnetic interference shielding,14,15 and wireless communication16. The 
electronic and functional properties of MXenes depend strongly on the surface terminations,17
20 so a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry is required to optimize the performance 
in these applications. Figure 1  Crystal structures of the niobium MAX 
and surfaceterminated MXene compounds. In a) 
Nb2AlC and b) Nb4AlC3, the crystallographic sites 
are labeled and the unit cells are outlined. Table 1 
describes the local coordination around each atom.
