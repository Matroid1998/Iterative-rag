Description:
Suitable binding groups for host scaffolds.

Text:
of multiple suitable binding groups, geminal bisphosphonates (BP),46 to the host scaffold (host 5, 
see Figure 1) or prefunctionalization of the MO substrates with propiolic acid and subsequent thiolyne click 
chemistry on the surface.47 Both strategies are schematically shown in Figure S15. The host molecules on MO 
substrates are slightly further away from the surface, and electrons are more localized and tightly bound in 
MOs.48,49 These factors may lead to decreased electronic coupling of the guests with the surface. 11
