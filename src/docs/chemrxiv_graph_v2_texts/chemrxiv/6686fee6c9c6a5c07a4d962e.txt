Description:
A second or third-row transition metal used in complexes for applications like artificial photosynthesis and organic light-emitting diodes due to strong metal-ligand bonds and long-lived photoexcited states.

Text:
Transition metal complexes have been exploited as light harvesters and luminophores in a number of applications such as artificial 
photosynthesis,1 organic lightemitting diodes,27 photoredox catalysis,8 photodynamic therapy,9 and biological sensing.10, 11 They 
have traditionally involved second and thirdrow platinum group metals because of their strong metalligand bonds and longlived 
photoexcited states after light absorption, typically involving metaltoligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions.12, 13 However, 
because of the scarce natural abundance, generally high cost, and typically higher toxicity of the heavier metals, there has been a 
growing interest in the development of photoactive firstrow transition metal complexes that do not suffer from these issues.14
