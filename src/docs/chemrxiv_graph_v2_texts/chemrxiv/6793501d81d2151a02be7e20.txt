Description:
Undergoes hybridization changes from C(sp2) to C(sp3) during phase transitions.

Text:
and context. The change from 2D Graphiticlike carbon to 3D Diamondlike structure (G2D) involves 
physical and chemical mechanisms that have been studied both experimentally and at 
different levels of modeling over the last 25 years. In 1999, Fayos showed that successive 
contractions of graphite in different directions, accompanied with C(sp2) to C(sp3) 
hybridization change simulate G2D phase transition 1. Recently we proposed to broaden the 
G2Dlike changes approach to be initiated by i the puckering of the atomic planar G layers 
by driving selected carbon atoms into offplane positions on the one hand, and ii a 
rationalized interlayer insertion of extra C to enforce the 3D structure, on the other hand (cf. 2 and therein cited works).

Description:
Forms various allotropes characterized by high hardness.

Also, the simultaneous presence of the two types of 
hybridizations was reported for a series of carbon allotropes characterized with high hardness 
3. Both last works were based on crystal engineering investigations and supported by 
quantum mechanics calculations within the Density Functional Theory (DFT) 4, 5. From ab initio random structure search combined with DFT investigations of the ground 
state properties Mujica et al. 6 proposed body center tetragonal (BCT) tetragonal C16. The 
structure is documented in the carbon allotropes database SACADA 7 with No. 66 and the 
topology 45t1. Such a topology analyzer is readily available online with the TopCryst 
program 8. Fig. 1a shows the C16 structure with space group I41a, No.

ctet4.500 . By considering the structure in a lower symmetry BCT space group I41 No. 80, 
the 16 atoms become dispatched over two Wyckoff positions at (8b) with 0.0986, 0.34645, 
0.02958 as above, and a second 8b with 0.34645,0.901400, 0.97042 and the same lattice 
constants as above. The structure, with two similar carbon substructures, is shown in Fig. 1b 
in two different colors of spheres. We then noticed that the removal of one of the two 
substructures leads to C8 (Fig. 1c) featuring a trigonal carbon structure as shown on the right
handside RHS polyhedral projection.

Description:
Forms trigonal and tetrahedral structures in 3D crystal builds.

Text:
The structure was found with srs topology (SACADA 
No.5 9) representing trigonal carbon in a 3D crystal build, i.e., versus G planar trigonal 
carbon in G2D approach, as discussed above. Consequently, the interconnections of the two 
trigonallike carbon substructures lead to the tetrahedral structure as shown in this example. Based on these observations aiming to extend the approach trigonal 2D carbon  
tetrahedral 3D carbon to trigonal 3D carbon  tetrahedral 3D carbon transformations, a 
novel allotrope BCTC20 is proposed herein with dia topology, close to diamond in all its
