Description:
A class of frontline antibiotics with safety concerns due to severe side effects, particularly used for treating Gram-negative strains.

Text:
With the rapid development of multiresistant bacteria, the arsenal of effective antibiotics to 
treat infections is dramatically shrinking.13 This crisis is further intensified by safety concerns 
with a class of frontline antibiotics, the fluoroquinolones (FQs), which received several black 
box warnings by the US food and drug administration (FDA) due to severe side effects.4,5 A 
restricted use of FQs is in particular a drawback for the treatment of Gramnegative strains 
which are only addressed by a limited number of alternative antibiotics capable of entering 
their almost impermeable cell membranes.6 Thus, to keep these desperately needed 
antibiotics within the firstline of defense against pathogenic bacteria, it is crucial to decipher
