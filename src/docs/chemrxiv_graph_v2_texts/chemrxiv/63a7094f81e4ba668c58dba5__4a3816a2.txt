Description:
Ceramics with low fracture toughness, limiting their application in laser-based additive manufacturing techniques.

Text:
However, for the 
aforementioned AM techniques, the material (to be deposited) needs to possess a good fracture 
toughness so that it does not fracture due to the formation of cracks during the layerwise 
deposition 3, 69. The main limitation of Al2O3 ceramics is the low fracture toughness 
which restricts the application of laserbased AM techniques in these ceramics 1.
