Description:
An active element in NiMn based layered cathode materials that provides capacity and can trigger oxygen redox above 4.1 V.

Text:
NiMn based layered cathode materials have attracted much attention in both LIBs and SIBs 
due to the high operating voltage of the Ni redox and its multiple electron couples 
(Ni2Ni3Ni4). In these materials, Ni is not only an active element that provides capacity, 
but it can also trigger oxygen redox when the voltage is above 4.1 V. This has been found for 
a variety of different NiMn ratios, e.g.
