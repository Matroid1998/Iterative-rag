Description:
Forms non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds in peptide assemblies.

Molecular selfassembly refers to the spontaneous and reversible organization of molecules into higherorder structures.1, 
2 This phenomenon is highly prevalent in nature, where assembled entities such as DNA or proteins exhibit distinctive 
biological functions.3 Peptidebased supramolecular architectures stand out for their biocompatibility, biodegradability, 
and ease of synthesis.4, 5 Such structures are based on the organization of peptides into secondary structures such as 
sheet or helix, which can then undergo hierarchical and multiscale assembly processes.68 These structures rely on non
covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, electrostatic and  
interactions, respectively.9 
In aqueous solution, these selfassembled peptide architectures can also yield hydrogels by entrapping large amounts of 
water.1012 To generate peptide hydrogels, the use of short peptides is particularly appealing as it offers robustness, 
scalability, and costeffectiveness.4, 7, 1315 Besides the rational design of short peptides, a common strategy to modulate 
the selfassembling properties involves protection of the N andor Cterminus through use of acetyl or large aromatic 
groups such as fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl protecting group (Fmoc).14, 1618 This modification reduces charge repulsions 
and introduces stackinghydrophobic contributions, thereby promoting selfassembly and hydrogel formation.1921 
Metal ions are frequently employed to trigger peptide assembly, thereby leading to hydrogelation.2225 Such metal ion
coordinated peptide hydrogels hold significant potential, as they exploit the unique physicochemical characteristics of 
metals, such as Zn(II), which play essential roles in biological processes and diseaserelated protein assemblies.13, 2629 
For instance, zinc, known for its antimicrobial and bacteriostatic properties, is beneficial in wound healing and infection 
prevention applications.22, 3034 Additionally, zinc plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis, imparting tensile strength to 
the newly formed tissue at the wound site.35 However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of metal coordination 
on peptide assembly processes affording hydrogels remains limited.
