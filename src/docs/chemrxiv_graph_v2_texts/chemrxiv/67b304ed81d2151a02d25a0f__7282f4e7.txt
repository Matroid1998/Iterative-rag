Description:
A TMC-based material that shows promise for catalyzing both the HER and OER due to its unique structural properties and electronic configurations.

In such cases, 
advanced in situoperando characterization techniques have 
emerged as powerful tools to address these fundamental 
challenges.2,24,25 For instance, CoSe2, as a representative TMC
based material, shows great promise for catalyzing both the 
HER and OER due to its unique structural properties and 
electronic 
configurations.10,2629 
Previous 
studies 
have 
revealed that the OER CoSe2 catalysts undergo significant 
phase transformations during the reaction process, in which in 
situgenerated CoOOHrelated species serve as a prerequisite 
for triggering the OER.10 However, the open question, Do the 
oxidized anionic components play a role in the OER? remains 
to be elucidated.

Description:
A robust material investigated for catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Text:
In sharp contrast, CoSe2 is generally 
investigated as a robust material to catalyze the HER,22,26,30 and 
the dynamics of its catalytically active species and sites during 
the HER remain to be fully understood. Notably, two main 
crystal phases, namely the orthorhombic phase (oCoSe2) with 
a marcasitetype structure and the cubic phase (cCoSe2) with
