Description:
Structure type formed by La3xTe4 due to valence imbalance.

Since mate
rials with low  are desired, many studies have been dedicated
to discovering novel low materials for TE applications.210
Zhu et al.10 combined graph neural networks and random for
est approaches to identify rareearth chalcogenides as materials
with low lattice thermal conductivity (L), in agreement with
known highperforming TE materials.1113 La3xTe4, which has
been extensively studied for hightemperature TE applications,
forms a defected Th3P4 structure type due to the valence imbal
ance of stoichiometric La3Te4.1417 The high TE performance of
La3xTe4 partly stems from synergistic effects of light and heavy
bands leading to overall advantageous electrical transport prop
erties,18 as well as enhanced phonon scattering from La vacan
cies.19 Similar materials, such as Pr3xTe4,20,21 Nd3xTe4,22 and
La3xS4 23,24 also exhibit low  and high TE performance, likely
due to the high degree of phonon scattering from the cation
vacancies.
