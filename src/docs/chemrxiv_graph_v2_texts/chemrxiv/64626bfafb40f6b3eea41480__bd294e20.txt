Description:
Contains heterobiaryl linkages.

Text:
Heterobiaryl linkages can be found in aciculitin AC, TMC95A as well as a 
synthetic heterobiaryl analog of arylomycin (Figure 1B).4,5 More recently, a novel PCSK9 inhibitor 
produced by Merck contains a peptide bridge involving a heterobiaryl linkage between a triazole 
and aryl rings. Synthetically, heterobiaryl and biaryl linkages in peptide macrocycles are typically 
constructed from buildingblocks and then incorporated into the peptide backbone via a 
conventional amidation reaction.
