Among the energy storage technologies, lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been the leading 
45 
technology in terms of research and industrial application 1. LIBs offer high energy density due 
46 
to the high theoretical specific capacity of lithium (3860 mAh g1), low density (0.534 g cm3) 
47 
along with the lowest reduction potential (3.04 V vs SHE). In addition numerous high voltage 
48 
high capacity cathodes, including Nirich transition metal oxides (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, 
49 
LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, etc..), Lirich (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) and high spinel (LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4) 
50 
electrode materials were developed but still some of them raise safety issues and show 
51 
extreme capacity fading or have lower energy density 25.

Description:
Prone to dendrite growth, which reduces safety in batteries.

In addition, LIBs suffer from critical 
52 
issues like lithium dendrite growth leading to reduced safety due to the use of flammable 
53 
organic electrolytes. Further, limited availability of elemental resources such as Li can pose a 
54 
supply risk in the future. Hence, it is important to investigate the alternative energy storage 
55 
technologies to keep up with the upcoming increased demand. 56 
Fluoride ion batteries are interesting candidates for energy storage applications owing to the 
57 
highest oxidation potential of FF2 redox couple (2.87 V vs SHE) and thus redox stability of 
58 
the fluoride ion F, low atomic mass of F (18.998 g mol1) along with the abundance of fluorine 
59 
itself 6 .
