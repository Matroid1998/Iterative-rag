Description:
A reagent used to modify nanographene ligands to form MOF intermediates with tunable bandgaps.

Text:
Ligand amino groups were also used for incorporation 
of transition metal ions for enhanced light absorption and 
bandgap tuning.61 A type of noncovalent PSM by introducing 
amine vapor and generating stable radical anions on MOF lig
ands via photoinduced electron transfer has also been demon
strated to effectively reduce the bandgap and extend absorption 
over the entire visible range.45 
The PSM of polyphenylenebased ligands using oxidative de
hydrogenation was shown previously to efficiently tune the 
bandgap of Zrbased MOFs.62 Here, we extend these studies by 
showing that a simple reagent, FeCl3, can be used to addition
ally modify nanographene ligands to form MOF intermediates 
(INT1, INT2, INT3 and INT4) with bandgaps that range 
from 2.12 eV to 0.69 eVs (Scheme 1).

Description:
A reagent used in the reaction with Zr-based MOFL0.

Text:
Specifically, the reaction 
between a Zrbased MOFL0 (also known as pbzMOF163) 
and FeCl3 was shown to generate intermediate MOFs with ab
sorption that redshifts from 345 to 850 nm. Based on our mech
anistic studies, we assign this red shift in the observed optical 
bandgaps to the successive formation of MOFs with planarized 
ligands (MOFL6, also known as PCN13662) and absorption 
at 490 nm, MOFs with chlorinated and planarized ligands 
(MOFL6Cln) and absorption at 615 nm, MOFs with oxidized 
radical cation and dication ligands (MOFL6Cln and MOF
L6Cln2) and the lowestenergy absorption band at 800 nm. Scheme 1. Illustration of the progress of the MOF reaction 
with FeCl3.
