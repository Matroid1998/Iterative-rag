Description:
Generated as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in nonthermal argon plasmas.

Text:
Argon plasmas currently see use in biomedical techniques such 
as argon plasma coagulation (APC), which has become com
monplace in electrosurgery, and especially in endoscopy17,18. APC utilises a radiofrequency alternating current (through ei
ther monopolar or bipolar electrodes) to generate gas dis
charges, which in turn generate desirable thermal effects in tis
sue  these thermal effects can be used for haemostasis, devi
talisation of tumours, and tissue reduction19. One understudied 
sideproduct of nonthermal argon plasmas is the generation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species 
(RNS), which can be utilised for reactions with various sub
trates20.
