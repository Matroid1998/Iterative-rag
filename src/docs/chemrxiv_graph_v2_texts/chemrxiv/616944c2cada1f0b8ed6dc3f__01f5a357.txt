Description:
A p-type dopant molecule studied for its role in charge transfer with polymer chains.

Text:
This ob
servation, while invoking the general interest in double
doping, also calls for a more detailed understanding of
the underlying mechanisms, as well as of material and
parameter dependencies. For example further details of
the charge formation such as formation of individual po
larons andor bipolarons upon doubledoping are of sig
nicant relevance for the transport properties of the re
sulting doped system.1722
In this work, we investigate a simultaneous charge
transfer between two p(g42TTT) conjugated polymer
(oligomer) chains in a close arrangement and a single
CN6CP ptype dopant molecule as illustrated in Fig
ure 1(a). Our study is rmly based on density func
tional theory (DFT) calculations taking into account
intermolecular vander Waals interactions and dielectric
environment.

Description:
Forms a dianion through double integer charge transfer.

Text:
While our approach includes the possibil
ity for other electronic processes to occur,21 the results
clearly show double ptype doping in the form of a dou
ble integer charge transfer from the conjugated chains
onto the dopant molecule a CN6CP dianion is formed
along with two individual singly charged polarons, one
on each polymer chain. The vibrational IR spectrum
we calculate for the CN6CP2p(g42TTT) complex with
double doping can clearly be traced back to those of in
dividual polarons and a CN6CP dianion.
