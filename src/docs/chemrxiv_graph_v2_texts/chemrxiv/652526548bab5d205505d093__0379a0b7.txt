Recently, stoichiometric lanthanum diselenide (LaSe2) has been highlighted as a poten
tial stable ptype conductive material with transparency in the near to midinfrared region,
with its high achievable conductivity and small hole eective mass relative to other ptype
transparent conducting materials (TCMs) noted as key advantages.6,7 ptype TCMs are
crucial to the development of more ecient optoelectronic devices including photovoltaics,
display monitors and especially smart windows, however ptype TCM performance lags well
behind their ntype counterparts, primarily due to the diculty in engineering band disper
sion in the valence bands of semiconductors.8 In ptype conductors transparent to visible
light, hybridization of cation states with oxygen 2p states at the top of the valence band
has been seen as key to such engineering,9,10 though recent highthroughput searches has
broadened this towards widegap chalcogenides and phosphides.11,12 With promising initial
transport measurements, LaSe2 deserves further investigation to understand the origin of its
optical and electronic behaviour, as well as exploring its optical and transport properties for
potential integration into future devices.
