Activation under mild conditions without significant carbon footprint is a coveted goal.

The commercial production of Ammonia (NH3) from N2 by the 
very wellknown HaberBosch process is of immense 
importance to sustain the global food supply chain as NH3 is the 
main component of most fertilizers.1, 2 Moreover, the NH3 
molecule is a promising carbonfree hydrogen vector owing to 
its high hydrogen content (17.65 wt).35 However, the 
industrial HaberBosch process converts N2 and hydrogen (H2) 
into NH3 at a very high temperature ( 300 C) and pressure ( 
100 atm), thus resulting in substantial carbon footprint.6 Hence, 
uncovering other alternative routes has emerged as a major 
goal so that the Herculean task of activating N2 to produce NH3 
can achieve a potential positive environmental and economic 
impact.79 In 
recent 
times, 
many 
Fe, 
Mo, 
Cobased 
monodinuclear complexes have been developed to efficiently 
catalyze the N2 reduction reaction (NRR).1012 In particular, the 
development of Schrock catalysts has suggested that this 
incredibly stable molecule can be transformed to ammonia at 
room temperature, albeit using a sacrificial reagent.13 Of late, 
sustainable approaches towards nitrogen molecule activation 
under mild conditions and most importantly without employing 
any significant carbonfootprint generating step have emerged 
as a rather coveted goal for the scientific community.35 A critical 
breakthrough was made when Xiong et al.
