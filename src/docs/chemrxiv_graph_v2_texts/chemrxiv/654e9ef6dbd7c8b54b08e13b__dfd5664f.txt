Description:
An electron-deficient arene that produced a low yield in azolation reactions.

Text:
To access such high oxidation potentials 
other concepts are required (Scheme 1B). Wickens and coworkers developed arene azolation 
reactions using an organic photocatalyst utilizing the consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer 
(conPET) mechanism,3 which was also exploited by Wagenknecht for challenging oxidations.4 
The method was effective for benzene or methylated arenes, whereas the oxidation of electron
deficient arenes, such as PhCl, produced a low yield of only 22 of the azolated product.
