1.1 Overview of Textile Industry Waste 
The textile industry is one of the largest global producers of polymeric waste, with synthetic 
fibers such as polyester, nylon, and spandex being the primary culprits. Polyester, in particular, 
is the most widely used fiber, accounting for over 60 of global textile production, but its non
biodegradability has led to significant environmental concerns 1.This results in the 
accumulation of waste in landfills and contributes to microplastic pollution in oceans and 
waterways, a growing concern for both the environment and human health 2. It is estimated 
that approximately 92 million tons of textile waste are generated annually, with much of it 
being sent to landfills or incinerated 3.
