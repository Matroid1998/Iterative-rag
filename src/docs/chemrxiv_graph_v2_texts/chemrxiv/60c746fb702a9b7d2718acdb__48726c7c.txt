Description:
Often decompose instantly at room temperature due to kinetic instability to heat, light, and moisture.

relatively stable and in some cases are commercially available, cy
clopropanones often decompose instantly at room temperature, as 
they are kinetically unstable to heat, light and moisture.4 The most 
common decomposition pathways involve either polymerization 
(heat and moistureinduced), decarbonylation to alkenes (light
induced), or nucleophilic ringopening as in the Favorskii rear
rangement.5 Nevertheless, cyclopropanone itself has been previous
ly prepared by reaction of diazomethane with ketene at 78 C 
followed by distillation at the same temperature,6 affording an ethe
real solution that must be used immediately at low temperature.

Description:
Highly strained species that are kinetically unstable.

A 
more common and practical approach popularized by Wasserman 
in the 1960s involves the use of alcohol adducts of cyclopropanone 
derivatives, such as cyclopropanone hemiketal 1, that can be trans
formed in situ to the corresponding strained ketone via base or 
acidinduced elimination (Scheme 1b).4d,7 Due in part to the poor 
leaving group ability of alkoxides, these unstable precursors require 
harsh conditions to equilibrate to the corresponding cyclopro
panones, which is problematic considering the kinetic instability of 
these highly strained species.
