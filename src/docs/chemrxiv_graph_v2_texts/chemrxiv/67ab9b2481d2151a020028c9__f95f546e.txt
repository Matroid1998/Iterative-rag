anthracene may be viewed as an electrondeficient analog of anthracene as the boron atoms 
feature empty porbitals that overlap with the adjacent benzene psystems, resulting in local 
antiaromatic character of the central C4B2 heterocycle (formally a 4pelectron system).3 Typically 
referred to simply as diboraanthracenes, arylsubstituted derivatives such as A (Figure 1) have 
been studied extensively as luminescent materials, building blocks for supramolecular constructs, 
Ztype ligand frameworks, and Lewis acid (co)catalysts.4 Recent efforts have culminated in 
further elongated acenes that are doped with multiple boron centers.5
