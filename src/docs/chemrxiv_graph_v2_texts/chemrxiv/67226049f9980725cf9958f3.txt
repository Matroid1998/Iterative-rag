Description:
Modification of the FIrPic emitter used in long-lasting PhOLEDs.

Text:
Nevertheless, a long
lasting PhOLED was manufactured exploiting pyrimidine
modification of the FIrPic emitter with skyblue max475
nm 16, whereas effective and relatively stable blue PhOLEDs
were created using triscyclometalated iridium(III) complexes
with Nheterocyclic carbene ligands 17,18. On the other
hand, red and NIR iridiumbased emitters suffer from low
quantum yields owing to nonradiative relaxation of the ex
cited state due to the energy gap law 19. Increasing the
rigidity of ligands 20, appropriate choice of substituents and
their positions 21 and incorporation of peripheral fragments
with large steric hindrance to eliminate unfavorable stack
ing interactions 22 may be effective to enhance the intensity
of lowenergy emission but all these design strategies have
limitations.
