Description:
Used in the preparation of MWCNTpolyamine hybrids and synthesis of thiazacridine derivatives.

Text:
Functionalization of commercial polymers via copolymerization leads to a variety of 
polymers with interesting properties. Halogen ringsubstituted ethyl 2cyano3phenyl2
propenoates (HECP) offer a convenient way to introduce a variety of functional groups in 
polyvinyl acetate backbone. 2Bromo HECP is reported in preparation of highly loaded 
MWCNTpolyamine hybrids and their application in catalysis 1, as well as in synthesis of 
thiazacridine derivatives as anticancer agents against breast and hematopoietic neoplastic 
cells 2. 3Bromo HECP is involved in synthesis of novel selenophenes from activated 
acetylenes, ethyl 2cyano3arylacrylate and potassium selenocyanate 3, also in 
straightforward preparation of highly loaded MWCNTpolyamine hybrids and their 
application in catalysis 4. The report on design, synthesis, antiproliferative evaluation and 
cell cycle analysis of hybrid 2quinolones cites 2chloro HECP 5.
