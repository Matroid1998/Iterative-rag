Description:
A refractory alloy with potential for high-temperature applications due to exceptional properties at elevated temperatures.

Gas turbines have wide applications in power generation and aerospace industries, which 
operate at very high temperatures. Following the efficiency, as defined in the Carnot cycle, the 
efficiency of a turbine can be increased by increasing the operating temperature 1, which 
demands the use of alloys with higher strength levels relative to that used currently. At present, 
Nibased superalloys are used in turbines which can operate up to 1100oC. Therefore, there is 
a need to design turbine materials that can withstand temperatures  1100oC to realize further 
improvement in turbine efficiency. Refractory alloys based on Nb, W, and Mo have the 
potential for hightemperature applications because of their exceptional properties at elevated 
temperatures.
