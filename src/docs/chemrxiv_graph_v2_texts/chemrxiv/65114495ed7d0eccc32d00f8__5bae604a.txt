Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of anthropogenic chemicals 
38 
characterized by containing multiple CF bonds 1,2. Due to their unique properties, they are 
39 
used in a wide array of daily products and different industrial applications 3. Their high 
40 
chemical resistance and water and oil repellency lead to the production of PFAS with a variety 
41 
of different chemistries 4. Due to the high stability of CF bonds, the perfluoroalkyl chains 
42 
of PFAS exhibit an intrinsic persistence that leads to a worldwide distribution of PFAS and 
43 
their terminal transformation products (TPs) such as perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) which were 
44 
extensively produced and used in the past 58.
