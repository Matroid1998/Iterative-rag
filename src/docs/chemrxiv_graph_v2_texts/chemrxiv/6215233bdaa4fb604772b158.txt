Description:
A traditional semiconductor material used in electronics.

Due to their exceptional versatility, organic semiconductors (OSCs) are a very attractive 
alternative to traditional silicon and GaAsbased semiconductors. OSC properties can be 
tuned to enable their use in fieldeffect transistors (FETs),14 photovoltaics,58 sensors,911 and 
flexible electronics.1214 However, rational design of OSCs for a particular purpose is still 
very challenging, requiring a combination of synthesis, analytical techniques, and 
modelling.15 On the modelling side, calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) 
with periodic boundary conditions are being increasingly used to investigate the 
optoelectronic properties of OSCs. Recently, hybrid DFT and its timedependent formulation 
(TDDFT) have been employed to study periodic porphyrin nanostructures,16 polyacenes,1719 
as well as polythiophenes and polypyrroles,20,21 exploring the changes in the band gap (Eg)
