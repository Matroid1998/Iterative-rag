Description:
Improves capacity in NMC structures.

Text:
LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC) compounds are declared as potential candidates due to their 
appealing merits, such as high specific capacity, average voltage, environmental friendliness, and stable 
working voltage. 811, 622, 532, 442, and 333 are different variants of the NMC structures. In these 
configurations, improved capacity, structural stability, and capacity retention are provided by the Ni, Mn, 
and Co contents, respectively.12 Meanwhile, LiNi mixing causes a fading in thermal stability and the 
creation of impurities on the cathode surface. Therefore, a coating modification procedure is suggested 
to form a protective layer on the NMC compound, which is able to avoid direct electrodeelectrolyte 
contact and boost the stability, durability, and safety where the cathode is subjected to repeated 
charging and discharging cycles.
