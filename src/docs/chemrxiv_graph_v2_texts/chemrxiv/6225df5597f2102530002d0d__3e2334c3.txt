Description:
Forms double-walled nanotubes.

Text:
Interestingly, dierent types of aggregates
were formed ranging from bilayers and ribbons, to wires and nanotubes, depending on the
chemical nature of the substituents and the experimental conditions. In this study, we were
interested in 1,1dioctyl3,3bis(2sulfopropyl)5,5,6,6tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine
(C8S3) (see Figure 1c), which forms doublewalled nanotubes1418 (see Figure 1d). C8S3
aggregates have been previously studied with MD simulation by testing the stability of dif
ferent types of aggregates and their optical properties1921. These studies were limited to
simulations of preformed aggregates, that do not necessarily allow the molecules to rearrange
and explore a large portion of the available congurational space.
