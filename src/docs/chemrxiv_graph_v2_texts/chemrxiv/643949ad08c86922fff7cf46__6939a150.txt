Stateoftheart semiconductor technology is based on rareearth metal doped silicon that 
requires a lot of energy and water for its manufacture and reaches its miniaturization limits.1
3 In comparison, organic semiconductors are flexible, lightweight, costeffective, and 
composed of earthabundant materials. Due to their modularity, organic semiconductor 
materials can be tailored to have specific properties, including high carrier mobilities, low
cost fabrication, and low environmental impact. Researchers are exploring the use of organic 
semiconductors in a wide range of applications, from solar cells to transistors to touchscreens.
