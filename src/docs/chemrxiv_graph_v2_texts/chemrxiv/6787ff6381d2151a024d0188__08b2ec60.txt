Biocatalytic transformations are becoming increasingly integral to 
synthetic chemistry, providing an efficient and selective alternative 
to traditional chemical synthesis while offering a complementary ret
rosynthetic logic.14 The past decade has witnessed the development 
of a variety of synthetically valuable biocatalytic processes which 
were not known in native enzymology.512 Among these, photobio
catalysis illuminates a new paradigm for exerting stereocontrol in 
free radicalmediated transformations, a challenging task that con
tinues to elude smallmolecular catalysts.1315 By capitalizing on the 
innate redox properties of natural cofactors including NAD(P)H10, 
1618 and flavin10, 1942, through cofactorbased excitedstate electron 
transfer, natural ketoreductases (KREDs),16, 17 imine reductases 
(IREDs),18 ene reductases (EREDs), 2040 fatty acid photodecarbox
ylases (FAPs)41 and cyclohexanone monooxygenases (CHMOs)42 
were successfully repurposed to catalyze unnatural stereoselective 
radical reactions.
