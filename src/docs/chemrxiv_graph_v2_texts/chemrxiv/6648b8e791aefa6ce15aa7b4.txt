Description:
A partially crosslinked substance used in experiments to mimic an oil in water emulsion.

Text:
While in most these examples, 
behavior of the bulk liquid under the influence of various internal and external factors like 
temperature 16, light 17, pH 18 has been studied in detail, how exactly confinement of the 
bulk liquid would affect the dynamics of a phenomena, or the equilibrium morphology of a 
buried interface has not been examined in any detail. It is to address this question that we have presented here an experiment in which migration of 
colloidal particles, dispersed within a liquid, to the interface with another liquid, has been 
examined under varying degree of confinement. In essence, here we have a partially 
crosslinked drop of silicone submerged within a pool of aqueous solution of a surfactant, 
thereby mimicking an oil in water emulsion.
