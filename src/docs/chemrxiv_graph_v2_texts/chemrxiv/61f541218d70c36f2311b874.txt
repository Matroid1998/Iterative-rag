Description:
A tetravalent doping atom that modifies the optical response of CeO2.

Text:
of tetravalent doping 
atoms (Zr, Ti, Sn and Si) significantly modifies the optical response of CeO2 in the visible range by shifting the 
absorption edge which also effects on the refractive index of the material. For these systems, the water contact 
angle has been computed through adsorption energy of water layers. We report the intrinsic hydrophilicity of the 
lowindex surfaces of CeO2, which is enhanced by introduction of the impurity atom. Influence of the dopants on 
the oxygen vacancy formation energy () is considered and discussed with respect to its possible effect on the 
hydrophobic behavior of CeO2.
