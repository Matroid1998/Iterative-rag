Description:
Used in the preparation of vinylenelinked pyridinebased small molecules or linear conjugated polymers.

Correspondingly, on the basis of very few monomers, vinylene
linked COFs with hexagonal crystal system occupied the major 
ratio, and several singlepore orthorhombic skeletons were 
originating 
from 
the 
ditopic 
monomer 
1,4
phenylenediacetonitrile17. While, a monomer with more 
carbon atoms ( 4) suitable for Knoevenagel condensation 
could not be found so far. Pyridyl nitrogencontaining molecules are widely used in 
catalysis, 
supramolecular 
chemistry, 
and 
organic 
semiconducting materials, associated with their intrinsic Lewis 
basicity, substantial physical properties, and selfassembling 
behaviors18. Knoevenagel reaction holds some merits in the 
preparation of vinylenelinked pyridinebased small molecules 
or linear conjugated polymers using methylsubstituted 
pyridine, due to lowcost, environmentally friendly reagents, 
less unidentified reactive intermediates, and only transalkene 
formation1921. Unfortunately, the mechanism of such traditional 
reaction seems never to be investigated.
