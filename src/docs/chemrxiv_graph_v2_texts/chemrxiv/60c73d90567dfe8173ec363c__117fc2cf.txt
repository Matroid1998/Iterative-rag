Description:
A material whose swellability can be exploited to load small molecule drugs and whose degradability in skin can release those small molecules over time.

We improved the feature 
size of the printed parts significantly by developing a 
post fabrication chemical etching protocol, which 
allowed us to access tip sizes as small as 1 m. With 
3D modeling software, various MN shapes were 
designed and printed rapidly with custom needle 
density, 
length, 
and 
shape. Scanning 
electron 
microscopy confirmed that our method resulted in 
needle tip sizes in the range of 1  55 m, which could 
successfully penetrate and break off into porcine skin. We have also shown that these MNs have comparable 
mechanical strengths to currently fabricated MNs and 
we further demonstrated how the swellability of PLA can 
be exploited to load small molecule drugs and how its 
degradability in skin can release those small molecules 
over time. Email ronald.smaldoneutdallas.edu, gassensmithutdallas.edu
