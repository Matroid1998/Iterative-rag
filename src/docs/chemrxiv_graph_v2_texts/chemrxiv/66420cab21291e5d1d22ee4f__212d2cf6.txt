Description:
A nitrile component used in chemical processes.

Text:
Some of the key nitrile components include 
malononitrile, cyanoacetic esters, cyanoacetamides, and cyanoacetophenones.16 The preferred solvents 
are ethanol, DMF, dioxane, or neat for some carbonyl compounds; (iii) a twopot reaction that involves an 
unsaturated nitrile (KnoevenagelCope condensation product) with elemental sulfur and (iv) an 
improved version of (i) involving the cyclization of activated nitriles with dimers of mercaptoketones 
or aldehydes. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20243lq16 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000205467537 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
