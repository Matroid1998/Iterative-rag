Description:
Prebiotically relevant molecules that can form coacervate protocells by liquid-liquid phase separation.

Compartmentalization of reagents can increase 
36 
local concentrations and create distinct chemical microenvironments, and might have therefore been an 
37 
important step in gaining sufficiently high reaction rates and selectivity at the origins of life.1013 
38 
Compartmentalization through selfassembly of amphiphiles into vesicles has long been 
39 
considered as the general mechanism for the formation of the first protocells.14 However, this 
40 
encapsulation was likely inefficient without the presence of active exchange of components by complex 
41 
transport machineries, limiting the local concentrations that could be reached inside these protocells.15 
42 
Since the discovery that membraneless organelles in modern cells can form by liquidliquid phase 
43 
separation (LLPS), the analogous formation of protocells by LLPS has received increasing interest.1618 
44 
Multiple weak associative interactions, such as chargecharge and cation interactions, between 
45 
molecules can drive LLPS to form (complex) coacervates, which are droplets of a soluterich phase 
46 
dispersed in a dilute continuous phase.19, 20 These coacervate protocells have been shown to 
47 
spontaneously concentrate reagents and increase reaction rates,21, 22 and recently it has been shown that 
48 
they can even be formed by prebiotically relevant mononucleotides and short homopeptides containing 
49 
just five residues.23, 24 Moreover, droplets made from peptides with prebiotically relevant low molecular 
50 
weight were found to be more effective at generating distinct pH microenvironments, accumulating RNA 
51 
and stabilizing its secondary structure, than coacervates formed by high molecular weight 
52 
polyelectrolytes.24
