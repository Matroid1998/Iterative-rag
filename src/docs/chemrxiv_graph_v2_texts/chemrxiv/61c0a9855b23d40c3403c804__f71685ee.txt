Description:
Chemistry used for developing new monomers and resins.

Text:
Recently very elegant approaches 
were proposed by BarnerKowollik and coworkers that developed 
new monomers and resins based either on thiolene chemistry,6 
TADpolyether ligation,7 silanebased monomers,8 onitrobenzyl 
ester monomers,9 and chymotrypsincleavable monomers.10 
With these chemistries, stimuli andor controlled degradation 
could be obtained. The groups of Zhao11 and Bowman12 
reported the 3D printing of linear polymers as a way to impart 
reprintability or recyclability to the printed object. Nevertheless, such materials have a lower chemical resistance 
due to the polymer solubility in organic solvent. Another possibility 
to induce recycling of crosslinked 3D objects could be to use the 
concept of dynamic covalent networks13 also known as vitrimers.
