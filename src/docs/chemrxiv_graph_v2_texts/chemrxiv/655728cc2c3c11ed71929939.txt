Description:
Forms bonds that are essential to life and drive structure in biochemistry.

Text:
Hydrogen bonds are essential to life as we know it, and the formation of hydrogen bond
networks is a key driver of structure in biochemistry,8 ubiquitous in critical cell processes
such as nucleotide base pairing9 and protein folding.10,11 However, the coarsegraining pro
cedure in Martini 3 places hydrogens together with heavy atoms into larger LennardJones
(LJ) particles and effectively averages out the energy contribution of directional hydrogen
bonding. In this work, we investigate whether the secondary and tertiary structure instabil
ity in Martini 3 proteins could originate from missing hydrogen bond energy.

Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds which are crucial for stabilizing protein structures in coarsegrained simulations.

Text:
We introduce
an algorithm called OLIVES which identifies native contacts with hydrogen bond capabilities
in coarsegrained structures, as an approximation for the atomistic hydrogen bond network,
and uses it to implement a novel Golike model for Martini 3 proteins. By using realistic
hydrogen bond energies obtained from literature ab initio calculations,1214 we show that
Martini 3 proteins can be stabilized by the introduction of LJ bonds between hydrogen
bonding beads in native contacts. As we embarked on creating a new Golike model concept for coarsegrained simulations
of proteins, we also established further goals for the models properties that we think will be
advantageous for the Martini 3 community and for supporting future developments.
