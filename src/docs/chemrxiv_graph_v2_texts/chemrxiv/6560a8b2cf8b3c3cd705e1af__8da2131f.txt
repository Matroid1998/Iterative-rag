Description:
A radical that undergoes hydrolysis.

Text:
The tyrosyl radical that is formed undergoes hydrolysis and the obtained 
orthoquinone can later be reduced to a catechol in a twoelectron and twoproton process.20 
Voltammetry is also useful for studying metalinduced conformational changes of A(1x) 
as well as A(1x)Cu(II) complexes, which are formed in the presence of Cu ions in the brain.6,27
30 For A(116), in the presence of Cu(II) ions, a decrease of the tyrosine oxidation peak current 
and a shift of the oxidation potential to more positive potentials has been observed.27 This suggests 
that the structure of the peptide changes significantly upon complexation of these metal cations. Interaction of redox active copper ions with beta amyloid peptides, both A(1x) and A(4x) leads 
to formation of ACu(II) complexes which have very different properties.
