For 
instance, they are involved as transient species in hydrogen atom transfer reactions,15 transannulation 
processes,16 photoinduced,17 electrochemical,18 and redox19 organic transformations, polymerizations,20 and 
metabolic processes with potential biological applications.21 As an example of their versatility, nitroarenes 
also support the formation of diradical transient species generated with visible light, that can be used as 
anaerobic oxidants for obtaining carbonyl and imine22 and alkene23 derivatives, and to promote oxygen 
atom transfer,24 CH hydroxylation of aliphatic systems,25 CC bond cleavage of olefins,26 and 
hydroxylation of olefins through CN bond cleavage.27 
The simplest nitroarene example is nitrobenzene (1), where the arene group is a bare phenyl ring. Nitrobenzene radical anion (1 or nitrobenzenide) has received extensive attention in the past decades.

Description:
Experiences hyperfine coupling constants in EPR spectra.

Text:
An early example of the 
sensitivity of 1 EPR spectra is Riegers computational study, who demonstrated that the solvent, in this 
case dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, plays a significant role in the hyperfine coupling constants 
(HFCs) of 1.29 Some years later, Geske and Maki reported the in situ electrochemical formation and EPR 
characterisation of 1 via cathodic reduction in acetonitrile with nPr4NClO4 as buffer in a mercury pool 
electrode.30 They were able to model the EPR spectra considering a monoradical ( 2.0032) 
experiencing HFCs to one nitrogen, and two ortho, two meta and one para hydrogen atoms (  10.32, 
  3.39,   1.09,   3.97 Gauss, respectively  see Equation 1 and Table S1).
