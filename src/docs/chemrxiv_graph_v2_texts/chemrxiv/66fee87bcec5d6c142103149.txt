The role of methane, as a shortlived greenhouse gas with high heattrapping potential, in global
warming is undeniable. Given these characteristics, mitigating methane emissions is one of the most
effective and efficient strategies for curbing shortterm global warming. The energy sector, particularly
the oil and gas industry, is a significant contributor to humancaused methane emissions. Many oil
and gas methane reduction strategies are costeffective or even profitable, as captured gas can often be
directed to pipelines and sold for additional profit, making oil and gas methane mitigation a financially
viable option. Gas releases from the oil and gas industry can be categorized as venting (releases of gas for known
and planned reasons), fugitive (unintended releases or leaks), and incomplete combustion emissions
(combustion slip).

Description:
A gas whose emissions can be detected and quantified using satellite measurements.

Text:
Accurate interpretation of oil and gas emissions profile requires considering source
types, event timing and intermittency (duration and frequency), release rate, and spatial emission
source distribution. This underscores the critical need for timely and accurate detection and localiza
tion of emission events, reliable quantification of gas release rate, and swift mitigation actions. A combination of measurement technologies is often recommended for effective detection and quan
tification of methane emissions events 13. Satellite measurements can remotely detect largescale
methane emissions occurring at the time of observation, enabling independent oversight and enhanc
ing transparency, particularly in understudied regions with limited site access. However, satellite
surveys have high detection thresholds and limited overflight frequency.
