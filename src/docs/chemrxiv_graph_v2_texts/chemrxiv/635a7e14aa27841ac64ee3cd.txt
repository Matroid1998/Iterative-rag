Description:
A material used for hybridization to enhance the electrochemiluminescence of carbon dots.

Text:
Carbon dots (CDs) have been emerged as potential emitting materials for ECL due to their 
merits of ease of surface functionalization, high water dispersibility, favorable biocompatibility, 
and excellent environmental friendliness.2330 It has been generally believed that the ECL 
emission of CDs is mainly dominated by surface energy levels and surface chemistry, while 
photoluminescence (PL) is primarily produced from the core.31 In this context, numerous efforts 
have been devoted to the ECL enhancement of CDs by heteroatom doping,3234 hybridization 
with dye25 or graphene35, and the oxidation of CDs surface.3637 However, despite these great 
successes in ECL of CDs, the fine tuning the ECL wavelength in a wide range, along with an 
understanding of the mechanism in the molecular level, has been rarely reported. 4
