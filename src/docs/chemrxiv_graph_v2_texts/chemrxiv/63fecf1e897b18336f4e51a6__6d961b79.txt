Description:
Applied on a manufacturing scale as a low-cost, eco-friendly oxidation agent.

Oxidation plays a key role in synthesizing highly functionalized molecules 1,2. Jones 
oxidation 3 and oxidation using KMnO4 4 are classically powerful methods, but the 
harsh and hazardous conditions are obstacles to applying these methods to complex 
molecules. Thus, a variety of mild and chemoselective oxidations have been 
developed Swern oxidation 5, tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP) oxidation 
6, Pinnick oxidation 7, and 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidinyl1oxyl (TEMPO) oxidation 
8. In particular, TEMPO oxidation has been applied on a manufacturing scale as a 
lowcost, ecofriendly and environmentally friendly oxidation 9. Although these 
oxidation processes have many advantages, they generally require stoichiometric 
oxidants, and reduced byproducts must be purged in a purification step, which 
decreases the atom economy 2.
