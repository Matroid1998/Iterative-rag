Description:
Used in determining octanol-water partition coefficients, which estimate hydrophobicity.

Text:
For example, interfacial 
hydrophobicity is often estimated based on the amount of nonpolar solventaccessible surface 
area3135 or by groupspecific parameters such as hydrophobicity scale values36 or octanolwater 
partition coefficients.19, 37, 38 However, these methods neglect perturbations to water structure by 
polar groups near nonpolar domains that lead to cooperative, nonadditive contributions to 
hydrophobicity,2426, 39 as highlighted by recent experimental measurements of hydrophobic forces 
with chemically heterogeneous interfaces.2729 In these experiments, adhesion forces were
