Description:
Halogen-based catalysts that efficiently catalyze halogen-abstraction reactions, Nazarov cyclizations, Diels-Alder reactions, or Michael additions.

Text:
Over the last years, the utilization of halogen bonding1 as a noncovalent interaction has been 
established in crystal engineering,2 molecular recognition,3 medicinal chemistry,4 and 
organocatalysis.5 Several mono and multidentate iodine(I)based XB donors, predominantly 
derived from dual iodo(benz)imidazolium or iodotriazolium motifs (Figure 1A), showed 
considerable strength as catalysts and can be referred to as halogenbased Lewis acids. For 
example, they efficiently catalyze halogenabstraction reactions,6 Nazarov cyclizations,7 Diels
Alder reactions,8 or Michael additions.9
