The 
high hydrogen fraction under frontend conditions can decrease 
the ethylene selectivity and increase the risk of hot spot formation 
or even reactor runaway and thus, renders the process control 
more challenging.23, 5, 711 With a suitable catalyst and safe 
operations, the excess amount of hydrogen in the frontend 
integration is advantageous because then a higher conversion of 
acetylene as well as the suppression of oligo and polymeric by
products (green oil  C4 hydrocarbons) can be achieved.23, 5, 7
11 Additionally, this reduces catalyst deactivation and results in a 
longer catalyst lifetime.23, 5, 711 Furthermore, with the frontend 
method the removal and subsequent addition of hydrogen 
becomes obsolete because the hydrogen produced during steam 
cracking is used within a more efficient process integration.2, 5, 12 
For both process options the stateoftheart catalysts are 
palladiumsilver nanoparticles supported on alumina pellets.4, 8 
However, due to the importance of the reaction, there has been a 
lot of research with focus on enhancing catalytic properties for 
palladium catalysts or even developing new catalysts.2, 4, 11 Here 
metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with their chemical versatility, 
high surface area and pore size variability, offer the possibility of 
directing selectivity and enhance the activity of the selective 
acetylene hydrogenation.1315 Recent studies on this reaction 
with specially designed MOFs for the separation of acetylene1621 
and MOFs as catalysts, e.g.
