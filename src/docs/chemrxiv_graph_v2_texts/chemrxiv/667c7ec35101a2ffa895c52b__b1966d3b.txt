Description:
A precious metal used in transpositional isomerization catalysis.

Text:
Isomerization and translocation of double bonds inside a molecule are essential steps in a variety of 
catalytic processes. Monoisomerization and especially chain walking reactions enable the 
functionalization of a great variety of organic frameworks.1 The compounds thus obtained are widely used 
as fragrances, agrochemicals and intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry.2 The field of 
transpositional isomerization catalysis has long been dominated by complexes based on precious metals, 
such as rhodium3, iridium4, ruthenium5 and palladium.6 However, representatives of base metal catalysts 
in this field have been fathomed.7 The early development of nickel8 and cobaltbased9 isomerization 
catalysts as well as industrial application of the latter10 represent some of the most established examples.
