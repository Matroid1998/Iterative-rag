Description:
A component of the bacterial cell membrane that can be labeled with Kdo8N3 for visualization.

Text:
In the first account in 2012, 
Kdo8N3 was chemically synthesized and used as a tool to label LPS and to selectively visualize the cell 
membrane of E. coli K12, Salmonella thyphimurium, and Legionella pneumophila strain Paris using 
fluorescence microscopy.9 Bacteria were incubated in a minimal medium (M9) with Kdo8N3 and 
subsequently reacted with a fluorophore through coppercatalyzed click chemistry. This method was 
further improved by growing the bacterial cells in a richer media (LB) supplemented with lower
