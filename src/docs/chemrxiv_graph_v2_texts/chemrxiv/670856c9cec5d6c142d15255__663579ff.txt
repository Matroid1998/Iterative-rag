Given the increasing global demand for energy, numerous researchers are actively 
37 
exploring renewable resources with reduced environmental impact compared to 
38 
traditional sources like petroleum and coal. Brazil stands out globally in this context as 
39 
48 of its energy matrix is renewable 7. In the biofuel sector, using ethanol from 
40 
sugarcane biomass in flexfuel engines has brought the country into focus, showcasing its 
41 
success in substituting petroleum derivatives with renewable fuels. 42 
Aside from ethanol, biodiesel and butanol are alternatives to conventional fuel 22. 43 
Biodiesel is the product of the transesterification reaction of vegetable oils or animal fats 
44 
with a shortchain alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol 27.

Description:
A potential fuel with energetic power comparable to petrofuels, less corrosive, less volatile, and less explosive.

Text:
Because it is an oxygenated 
45 
fuel and free of aromatic and sulfurized components, it has a more efficient combustion, 
46 
reducing the emissions of many polluting gases, such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
47 
hydrocarbons, and particulate matter 34. Comparatively, butanol has demonstrated 
48 
potential as a fuel soon, with energetic power comparable to petrofuels while being less 
49 
corrosive, less volatile, and less explosive 6. Furthermore, butanol can be obtained from 
50 
biomass through the acetonebutanolethanol (ABE) fermentation process 22. 51 
Among the many physicalchemical properties that a fuel needs to meet to be used, 
52 
the flash point (FP) is a property that is intimately connected to the volatility of flammable 
53 
liquids or fuels.
