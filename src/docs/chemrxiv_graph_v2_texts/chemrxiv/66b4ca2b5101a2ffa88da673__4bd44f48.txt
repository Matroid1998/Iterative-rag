Description:
A low-volatile acid believed to play a decisive role in initial cluster formation and growth in the atmosphere.

Combined, these aerosol eects
present the largest uncertainty in the understanding of our current climate and the predic
tion of climate change in the future.4 NPF is a large source of this uncertainty, as it remains
uncertain which atmospheric vapours that are important for the initial cluster formation and
the subsequent growth.5
Atmospheric lowvolatile acids such as Sulfuric Acid (SA),6 Methanesulfonic Acid (MSA)7,8
and Nitric Acid (NTA)9 are believed to play a decisive role in the initial cluster formation
andor growth process.
