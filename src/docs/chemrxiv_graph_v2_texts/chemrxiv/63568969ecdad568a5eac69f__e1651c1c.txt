Description:
Serves as a catalyst for CO oxidation, with enhanced reaction rates under pulsed heating.

In contrast, operation under nonsteady state conditions, by rapid variation of temperature, 
can lead to higher reactor output, higher energy efficiency, and differences in product selectivity, which 
has been theoretically examined for more than 50 years,2,3 and more recently experimentally 
demonstrated.48 The idea behind such pulsed mode of operation is that the catalyst surface is rapidly 
switched from low temperature to high temperature, thereby performing catalysis with a high rate and 
with surface coverages that are ordinarily not associated with steadystate high temperatures. So far, pulsed heating has been implemented using electrical microreactors with a thermal modulation 
longer than 25 s,46 resulting in reaction rates for CO oxidation on Pt 40 times higher than under steady
state heating at the same average power.
