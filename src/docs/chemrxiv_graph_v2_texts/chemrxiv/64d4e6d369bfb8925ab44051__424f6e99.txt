Description:
Compounds with large chiroptical response and charge-transport properties, used in organic electronic technologies.

Text:
Helicenes are promising
compounds for designing new organic electronic technologies due to their large chiropti
cal response, chargetransport properties, and their ability to filter electron spin at room
temperature.1720 Chirality adds another level of complexity to the solidstate formation,
as chiral compounds can form both enantiopure and racemic crystals with very different
electron transport properties. For example, aza6helicene has an 80fold increase in hole
