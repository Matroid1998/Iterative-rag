Description:
A Hoffmantype MOF with a formula involving pyrazine and a metal center.

Text:
The former is the total energy difference between the
two spin states and represents the dominant contribution
to enthalpy change upon spin transition. By assuming the
entropic contributions as those reported previously, 23,24 we
estimate the target values of adiabatic energy differences be
tween 0.2 and 0.6 eV for a spin crossover near room temper
ature. The calculations are performed using seven porous ma
terials belonging to three MOF families with different
metal choice or local environment of the openmetal cen
ter. Two are the Hoffmantype family 2527 with formula
Fe(pz)M(CN)4 and Fe(bpac)M(CN)4, where M  Fe(II),
Mn(II) and Ni(II) exhibits a square planar coordination. The pz  pyrazine and the bpac  (bis(4pyridyl)acetylene).
