Description:
Building blocks of proteins, often functionalized for various applications.

Text:
To overcome these 
limitations and expand the functionalization toolbox, less 
exploited amino acids such as methionine,4 tryptophan,5 
histidine6 and tyrosine7 have been investigated. Tyrosine bioconjugation in particular shows promising results 
(Scheme 1b).7 Among natural amino acids, it is an interesting 
residue for siteselective modification, as it is relatively rare on 
protein surfaces,8 and is often buried within the protein 
structure due to the amphiphilicity of the phenol moiety.
