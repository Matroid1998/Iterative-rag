Description:
Fixation is enhanced by the rapid growth of microalgae, leading to higher productivity than terrestrial crops.

Text:
Its dual character of serving both as a crop and as an industry feedstock affects availability and prices. At the same time, it also raises sustainability issues since it requires considerable acreage, high water use, and high energy 
usage for its processing and transport (10). Microalgae, in contrast, can serve as a more sustainable feedstock material (11). Their simple nutrient requirements and no 
requirement for arable land or freshwater, exclude them from the competition with crops (12, 13). Their rapid growth leads to 
higher productivity than terrestrial crops, such as soy (14), and by extension, leads to higher CO2 fixation (15). Microalgae cells,
