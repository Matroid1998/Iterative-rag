Description:
Ligands with a C atom as the bridging centre between P and N donors.

Text:
Hybrid ligands that feature different 
donor sites can take advantage of specific binding 
preferences to give control of coordination chemistry, 
and allow for these cooperative effects such as 
hemilability, 
proton 
shuttling, 
and 
substrate 
recognition and activation (Figure 1A).1 1,3P,N 
ligands are a widely studied class of compounds that 
can bind selectively through the hard Natom, the 
soft Patom, or both, and can bind to one or multiple 
metal centres.26 This ligand class is typified by 2
pyridylphosphines and iminophosphines, both of 
which have a C atom as the bridging centre between 
the P and the N donors (Figure 1B).2
