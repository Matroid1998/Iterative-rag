Description:
Synthesized using 3-methoxy ring-substituted methyl PCA in diastereoselective processes.

Text:
Alkoxy ringfunctionalized phenylcyanoacrylates (PCA) are reported in a variety of 
applications 411. Thus, 2methoxy ringsubstituted methyl PCA was used in 
pyrrolizinone synthesis 1, as well as in molecular design for linear and nonlinear optical 
response 2, 3. 3Methoxy ringsubstituted methyl PCA was employed in diastereoselective 
syntheses of polysubstituted cyclohexanes and cyclopentenes 4 and in enhancement of the 
hyperpolarizability of styrene 5. Propyl PCA with 4methoxy ringsubstitution was used in 
synthesis of cyanoacrylates 6 and in technology related to antenna dyes 7. 4Propoxy 
ringsubstituted propyl PCA was synthesized in MgObased catalyzed Knoevenagel reaction 
8. 4Butoxy phenylsubstituted ethyl PCA was an intermediate in synthesis of 6amino4
(4butoxyphenyl)3,5dicyanopyridine2(1H)thione 9, as well as in synthesis of 
(arylmethylene)cyanothioacetamides 10. 4Hexyloxy ringsubstituted ethyl PCA was 
mentioned in preparation of prostaglandin E synthase inhibitors 11.
