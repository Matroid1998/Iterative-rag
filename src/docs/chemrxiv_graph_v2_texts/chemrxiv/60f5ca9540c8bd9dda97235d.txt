Attract significant research attention for their use in photovoltaic panels.

The main substance of concern is cadmiumcontaining quantum dots (CdQDs), due to the known 
toxicity of Cd.4 This substance of concern has led to numerous studies reviewing the sustainability of the 
CdQDs and competing substances.5 For example, life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been performed to 
compare the cumulative energy demand of CdQDs and indiumcontaining QDs (InQDs).6 After updating 
these assessments with new data on the amount of materials in televisions, InQDs were found to require 
approximately 13 times more energy (MJ cm2) than CdQDs.7 LCAs have also been used to point out areas 
of concern in the manufacturing of CdQDs into quantum light emitting diode displays (QLEDs), such as 
the aquatic acidification and ecotoxicity of a CdQD encapsulating polymer.8 Another substance class of 
interest to displays, perovskites, have attracted significant research attention for their use in photovoltaic 
panels, and sustainability assessments have mostly focused on that application.
