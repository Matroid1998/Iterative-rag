Description:
A chlorinated silane used as a precursor in silicon carbide processes.

Text:
Polycrystalline silicon carbide (SiC) is a protective coating of choice in many industries due 
to its high chemical inertia, hardness and temperature stability. Among SiC polytypes, cubic 
SiC, also known as 3C or SiC, is the most used in refractory applications due to its relatively 
low formation temperature. One of the techniques frequently adopted for the synthesis of 
polycrystalline 3CSiC is chemical vapor deposition (CVD)1. In a SiC CVD process, 
multicomponent precursors, e.g. methyl trichlorosilane, can assure unity of CSi ratio in the 
gas phase, whereas singecomponent precursors containing only C or Si can grant the process 
extra degrees of freedom in choosing different Si and Csource precursors2. Chlorinated 
silanes, especially silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) are widely used precursors in many SiC 
processes.
