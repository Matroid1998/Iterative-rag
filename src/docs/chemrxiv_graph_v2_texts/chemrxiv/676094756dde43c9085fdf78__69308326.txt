Description:
Used for chemisorption on metal oxides.

Text:
This 
stability is typically achieved by coating the NPs with an organic layer that electrostatically or 
sterically stabilizes the suspension.10,11 Depending on the intended application, nanoparticles 
may be functionalized either by physisorption of polymers12 or polycharged molecules,13 or by 
chemisorption, using, for example, thiol derivatives for noble metals14 or phosphonic 
derivatives for metal oxides.15 In this context, we introduced a covalent functionalization 
strategy based on the grafting of calix4arene tetradiazonium salts.16,17 These macrocyclic 
molecules can form multiple covalent bonds with metal surfaces, leading to a dense and thin 
organic layer that can be used to functionalize nanoparticles of various compositions and 
shapes.18,19 This calixarenebased approach has been shown to surpass the traditional thiol 
chemistry in terms of stability and controlled composition of the coating.20,21 Secondly, with
