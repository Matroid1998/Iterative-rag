Description:
Stable organic radicals used as oxidants in synthetic organic chemistry.

Text:
Nitroxides (also known as aminoxyl or nitroxyl radicals) are 
suited for innumerable applications across the chemical 
sciences.1, 2 These stable organic radicals are, for example, used 
as oxidants in synthetic organic chemistry,3 mediators for 
radical 
polymerization,47 
redoxactive 
components 
for 
materials science,8, 9 and as potential therapeutic agents.10 
Nitroxides have also found a unique place of significance in 
spectroscopy. Due to the localized radical distribution, small 
molecular size, and readily tunable properties through 
structural modification, nitroxides are highly suitable for use as 
observable probes in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectroscopy11, 12, 13 and EPR imaging.14 Moreover, nitroxides 
are used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as 
dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) transfer agents,15, 16 
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) probes,17 and as 
contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).18, 19
