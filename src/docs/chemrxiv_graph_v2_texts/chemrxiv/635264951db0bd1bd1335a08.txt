Description:
Used in combination therapies for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.

Text:
Acute toxoplasmosis can be lifethreatening in immunocompromised hosts, and 
upon primary infection during pregnancy the parasite can cross the placenta and inflict foetal damage 
andor abortion6, rendering this parasite an important public health problem2, 7. T. gondii also affects 
livestock, most notably small ruminants, and wildlife animal species, which brings considerable 
economic constraints2, 7. Current management of toxoplasmosis relies on conventional therapy, which has important 
shortcomings related to reduced tolerance and overall potency, poor efficacy to the latent stage of the 
parasite, as well as drug resistance8, 9. Prevailing treatments are based on combination therapies 
comprising sulfonamides and pyrimethamine10.
