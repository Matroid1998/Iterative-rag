Description:
Abundant in typical crude oil with diminishing concentrations as ring size increases.

Traditionally, petroleum analysis is based on prefractionation using silica 
58 
chromatography or solidphase extraction (SPE) cartridges followed by GCMSn.2023 SPE is 
59 
a lowefficiency separation technique, depending on chemical selectivity. This allows crude 
60 
isolation of the aromatics fraction, but not separation of the compounds within it. Thus, an 
61 
aromatic fraction obtained by SPE contains both the benzenes, naphthalenes and larger rings. 62 
Here, a typical crude oil will have a high abundance of monoaromatics, with diminishing 
63 
concentrations with increasing ring size. The appropriate GC oncolumn concentration of the 
64 
naphthalenes typically results in the larger ring systems being below the limit of detection 
65 
(LOD).
