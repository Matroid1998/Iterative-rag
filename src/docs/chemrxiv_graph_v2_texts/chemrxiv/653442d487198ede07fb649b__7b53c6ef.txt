Description:
Cleavable linkages incorporated into PE backbones for closed-loop chemical recyclability.

Text:
Several notable recent advances were made towards circular HDPElike polymers with closed
loop chemical recyclability through incorporation of cleavable linkages such as ester bonds into 
the PE backbones. In 2021, longchain alkyl polyester produced via polycondensation of diol 
or diester monomers26,27 was reported to possess HDPElike thermomechanical properties23.In 
2022, another approach to circular HDPElike polyester was developed using the diester end
capped PE obtained via tandem dehydrogenationmetathesis of postconsumer HDPE24 or 
tandem ethylene copolymerization with an oxanorbornene comonomer, retroDielsAlder 
reaction, and metathesis25 (Fig. 1b).

Description:
A functional group endcapping telechelic PE building blocks in polymerization.

Text:
We reasoned that an effective and scalable approach should be an innovative dropin 
process based on the widely practiced coordination (co)polymerization of ethylene and 
olefins in the current plastics industry28.To realize this strategy, we first synthesize ABtype 
telechelic PE building blocks endcapped with alcohol (OH) functionality (A) at one end and 
ester (CO2Et) functionality (B) at the other by coordinative chaintransfer polymerization 
(CCTP) of ethylene and 1octene with suitable chaintransfer and chainend capping reagents. We further hypothesized that the advantage of AB telechelic building blocks over A2  B2 ones 
in polycondensation, especially concerning precise stoichiometric control, should allow for 
LEGOtype modular assembly of AB building blocks into ondemand PE materials.
