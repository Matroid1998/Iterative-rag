Description:
Ions have a long diffusion path within composite cathodes, limiting rate capability and specific power.

Text:
While such composite cathodes can provide 
high energies, the long diffusion path of lithium ions within the composite cathode limits their 
rate capability, and thus their specific power 5 with record values up to 2.6 kWkg1.6 In 
addition, capacity fading and lithium dendrite growth at high rates is an ongoing challenge and 
poses a significant limitation and safety risk when combined with flammable organic liquid 
electrolytes.79 
Solidstate batteries (SSBs) have attracted great interest for their ability to increase safety at 
high chargingdischarging rates.10 However, the specific energy and power of SSBs lag behind 
that of conventional Liion batteries because current solid separators are significantly thicker 
than the separators used in Liion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes.11,12 
Vacuumbased methods enable the fabrication of thinfilm SSBs with electrode thicknesses on 
the order of micrometers in combination with (sub)micrometersthick separators and current 
collectors.13,14 In contrast to wetchemical methods, solidstate thin films prepared by vacuum
based methods such as sputtering are dense and homogeneous and offer precise control of film 
thickness and composition.15 Due to the short diffusion paths, thinfilm SSBs offer more than 
ten times higher chargingdischarging rates than composite cathodes16,17, enabling high powers 
yet with limited energy due to low areal capacities.
