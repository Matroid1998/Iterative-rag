Description:
Compounds that exhibit F centers arising from anion vacancies.

Text:
F centers are point defects commonly observed in metal oxides, arising from anion vacancies. They possess distinct electronic states, including a singlet ground state and a triplet excited
state. The optical properties of the F centers are highly tunable, making them suitable for
a wide range of colorcenter laser applications.1 In particular, magnesium oxide (MgO), an
ionic oxide, exhibits F centers that significantly influence the materials chemical properties,
thus making it a promising candidate for optoelectronic and catalytic applications.2,3 The
interesting properties of F centers in alkaline earth oxides can be attributed to their distinct
electronic structure which results from the emergence of new local energy levels within their
optical gap.
