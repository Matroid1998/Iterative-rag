Description:
Formed by copper at neutral pHs, depending on the potential.

Copper is the noblest of the 3rd transition metals. It can form two stable passivating oxides at 
neutral pHs, depending on the potential (Parsons, 1967). The fabrication of copper oxides and 
copper ions in different morphologies has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their 
potential application in so many fields such as energy conversion, electrode materials, catalysis, 
etc (Gawande et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). The main feature of the copperenhanced 
mechanism for the dissolution of synthetic magnetite is the electron transfer between CuCu2 
and a surface Fe3 species (Zeng et al., 2012).
