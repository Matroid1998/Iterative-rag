Description:
Crystalline thin films produced at temperatures as low as 500 Â°C using solution deposition of molecular precursors.

Text:
achieved temperatures below 700 C 
through pulsed laser deposition,29 while Comparotto et al. grew 
BaZrS3 thin films at 600 C using sputtering and sulfurization.30,31 
More recently, significant advances have been made by Agarwal 
and Bart in preparing thin films from the solution deposition of 
molecular precursors, with crystalline thin films of BaZrS33, 
BaTiS3, and BaHfS3 produced at temperatures as low as 500 
oC.32,33 
 An alternative approach to solutionprocessed thin film 
deposition is through the preparation and use of colloidal 
nanocrystal inks;34,35 notably, Nag et al.
