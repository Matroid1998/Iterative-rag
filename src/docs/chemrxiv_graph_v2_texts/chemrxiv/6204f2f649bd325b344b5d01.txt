Amino acids and their derivatives play a central role in 
the design of life. They often serve as building blocks to 
make up peptides and proteins. The replacement of pro
ton with an alkyl group results in increased stability of the 
corresponding amino acid towards hydrolysis and enzy
matic degradation, while maintaining the activities on rec
ognizing and binding with the receptor on the cell mem
brane.1 These properties have motivated extensive research 
interests on development of concise methods for their effi
cient preparation. 214 
NH insertion of a donoracceptor carbene intermediate 
is versatile for accessing mono substituted amino acid 
derivatives (Scheme 1a, left)1524.
