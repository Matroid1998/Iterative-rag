Description:
A dense polymorphic modification of BN with wurtzite structure.

Text:
An enormous number of polytype crystal structures are known for silicon carbide, SiC, with the 
most well known being cfc 6H (P63mc) moissanite. The cfc topology is also adopted by 
hexagonal carbon allotrope C8, called 4C carbon 4, which is used here to create new BN and 
BC2N structures. BN is isoelectronic with two carbon atoms BN(8e)  2C(8e) (e  electron) and is known to exist in 
four polymorphic modifications two graphitelike, hexagonal (P63mm) (hBN) and rhombohedral 
(R3m) (rBN), and two dense, cubic (F43m) (cBN) and wurtzite (P63mc) (wBN), which are close 
analogs of the main carbon allotropes (hexagonal and rhombohedral graphite, diamond and 
lonsdaleite). BN it is also isoelectronic with SiC BN(8e)  SiC(8e). The eight electrons belong to 
the outer shells, i.e.
