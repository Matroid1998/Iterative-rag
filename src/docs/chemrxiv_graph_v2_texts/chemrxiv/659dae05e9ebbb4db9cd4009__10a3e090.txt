Description:
A novel dihydroxanthone-derived homodimer with an unprecedented heptacyclic ring system isolated from Aspergillus sp.

Text:
In 2020, the Zhang group isolated the novel dihydroxan
thonederived homodimer nidulaxanthone A (5) (Figure 1B) 
from Aspergillus sp.5 Structurally, compound 5 features an un
precedented heptacyclic ring system which is highly unusual 
in comparison to other natural dihydroxanthone dimers such 
as the 2,2linked structures phomalevones A (6) and C (7).6 
Although ()nidulalin A (1) was synthesized by Hosokawa 
and coworkers in 20097 using a 10step synthesis, we were 
interested to develop a concise synthesis of 1 to study methods 
for chemical dimerization to nidulaxanthone A (5).
