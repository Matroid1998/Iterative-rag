Description:
Organic compounds that can be oxidized to carboxylic acids by aldehyde dehydrogenases.

Text:
Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a family of NAD(P)dependant enzymes that catalyse the 
oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids.1 Endogenous aldehydes can be produced as a result of 
metabolism of amino acids, alcohols, lipids and vitamins, while exogenous aldehydes can derive 
from the metabolism of cytotoxic drugs and environmental factors.26 Currently 19 ALDH isoforms 
have been characterised in humans,7 and ALDH1 isoforms (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3) are 
considered to be of particular interest due to their role in the detoxification of anticancer drugs.8 

ALDH1A1 expression has been correlated with poor overall survival in a range of cancers, including 
ovarian cancer.9, 10 Resistance to chemotherapy represents a significant challenge in the treatment 
of ovarian cancer, with a high proportion of women ultimately succumbing to recurrent disease.11 
Tumour recurrence arises from drugresistant tumour cells able to repopulate the tumour niche 
and seed new lesions.
