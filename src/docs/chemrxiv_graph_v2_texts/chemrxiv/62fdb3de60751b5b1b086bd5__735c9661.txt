Description:
Caged compounds exemplified by RDX, such as HMX and CL201.

Text:
RDX (1,3,5Trinitroperhydro1,3,5triazine) is a common highenergy dense oxidizer in many energetic
materials (EMs), which is a representative example of the caged polynitroamines, such as HMX and CL201. RDX
has been used for more than 70 years, and there is a long history of scientific research on the material2. Thermal
decomposition is a fundamental process for any EMs exposed to external stimuli. It relates to the ignition of
explosives, the subsequent detonation performance, and their sensitivity from mechanical stimuli to direct heating3. A comprehensive understanding of thermal decomposition mechanisms is essential for the performance and safety
of EMs. The decomposition mechanism of RDX crystal is widely investigated in abundance by experiments and
computational simulations.
