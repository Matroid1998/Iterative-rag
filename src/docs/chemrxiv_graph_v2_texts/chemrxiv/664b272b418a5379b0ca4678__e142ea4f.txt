Description:
Ligands used in MOFs for electronic and photoactive materials.

Text:
In this regard MOFs that contain ligands based on rylene 
diimides are particularly attractive due to the rich chemistry of such systems and their application 
in electronic and photoactive materials.1416 In the context of MOFs, by far the most studied 
rylene diimides are naphthalene diimides (NDIs).17 NDIcontaining MOFs have been extensively 
developed and include seminal examples of electrochromic materials.10,11 Despite the interesting 
properties that can be developed using NDI components, such systems are limited by the 
inherent properties of the NDI manifold. An alternative is to explore rylene diimide analogues 
such as perylene diimides (PDIs).
