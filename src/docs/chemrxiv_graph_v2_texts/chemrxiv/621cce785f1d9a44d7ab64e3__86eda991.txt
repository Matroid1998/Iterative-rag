Description:
An anion that forms part of the close-packed system in spinel structures.

Text:
The spinel
structure (shown in Figure 1) consists of a closepacked system of
anions (X  O, S, Se) with onehalf of octahedral and oneeighth
of tetrahedral sites occupied by cations giving a reduced formula
of AB2X4 where A is a divalent cation and B trivalent. Spinels can be disordered over cationic sites by having some of
the B3 cations in tetrahedral rather that octahedral sites. The de
gree of inversion of a spinel describes the extent to which A2 and

(a) Front
view of spinel with tetrahedral Zn atoms (grey) between layers of oc
tahedral Fe atoms (orange) and O anions (red). (b) 3D view of cubic
spinel. (c) Layers of closepacked O atoms with A (green) B (yellow) and
C (blue) layers highlighted. The view in (a) is transformed to the view
in (c) by rotation of 45 around the caxis followed by a rotation of 55
around the bisection of the aaxis and baxis perpendicular to the caxis. B3 cations occupy octahedral and tetrahedral sites respectively
with the two extremities shown in Figure 2. A fully normal struc
ture has all occupied tetrahedral sites consisting of A2 cations
and all occupied octahedral sites consisting of B3 cations.
