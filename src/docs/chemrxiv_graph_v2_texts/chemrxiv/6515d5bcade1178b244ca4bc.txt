Description:
Photoactive compounds that can be switched between cis and trans configurations with light, affecting their chemical structure and properties.

An effective use of TG as a novel therapy requires 
modifying the compound in a manner that it is selective for the 
desired target cells.7 This concept was successfully employed for 
prostate cancer (PC) by incorporating a peptide substrate for the 
prostate specific antigen (expressed in PC tumours) into TG to 
bestow the construct with selectively towards malignant tissue in 
vivo.3 
In this study, we explore a general possibility for controlling 
the TGmediated SERCA inhibition by using azobenzenes  
photoactive compounds, which can be switched between their 
cis 
and 
transconfiguration 
(Figure

with 
light.8 
Photoisomerization of azobenzene results in significant change to 
its chemical structure and properties the transconfiguration, 
which is accessed through thermal relaxation in the dark or active 
photoswitching with blue light, is planar and essentially nonpolar, 
while the cisconfiguration, which is accessed with UV light, 
adopts a bent conformation, resulting in a 3.5  change in end
toend distance and a considerable increase (3 Debye) in
