Description:
Probes that can covalently label lysine residues in various protein kinases.

Text:
For 
example, Taunton et al. developed a class of sulfonyl fluoride 
probes that can covalently label lysine residues in various protein 
kinases7, and they recently reported reversible covalent kinase 
probes based on a salicylaldehyde for in vivo studies8. Campos et al. reported an active ester probe which can produce selective and 
irreversible inhibition of PI3K by targeting a catalytic lysine in the 
protein kinase9. Yao et al. reported the use of oboronic acid 
benzaldehyde, SuFEx and salicylaldehyde to afford BCRABL 
kinase inhibitors which target the conserved lysine residues10,11.
