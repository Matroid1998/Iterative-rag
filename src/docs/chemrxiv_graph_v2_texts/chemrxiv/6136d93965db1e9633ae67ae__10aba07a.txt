Description:
Produced by omission of bueE, indicating BueE's role in catalyzing multioxidation of terminal methyl groups to carboxylic acids.

Text:
of the reassembled bue gene cluster into Aspergillus nidulans for heterologous expression resulted in the production of 
burnettiene A under native promoters. Omission of bueE encoding a cytochrome P450 led to the production of preburnettiene A, confirming 
that BueE is responsible for catalysing the regiospecific multioxidation of terminal methyl groups to carboxylic acids. Similarly, bueF was 
shown to encode an esterforming methyltransferase, with its omission resulting in the production of the tricarboxylic acid, preburnettiene 
B. Introduction of an additional copy of the transcription factor bueR under the regulation of the gpdA promoter significantly improved the 
heterologous production of the burnettienes. Burnettiene A displayed strong in vitro cytotoxicity against mouse myeloma NS1 cells (MIC 0.8 
gmL).
