at 1,3 phenolic positions within the calix4arene framework has the potential to yield
distinctive structural features and enhanced functional properties. Despite their oppor
tunities, calix4arene preparation requires careful characterization of conformationally
restricted rotomers. We used a combination of experimental and computational tech
niques to elucidate the threedimensional structure and conformational dynamics of a
1,3bridged calix4arene derivative. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
Density Functional Theory (DFT) based optimization, and Boltzmannweighted NMR
chemical shift calculations are used to determine the precise molecular structure of
