Description:
Dyes investigated as optical probes for nucleic acids of different topologies.

NucDAOTA exhibits an 
increase in fluorescence intensity and lifetime upon specifically binding with DNA but not with 
RNA (ribonucleic acid) or water soluble protein BSA (bovine serum albumin), that is also a key 
feature of this probe. Vilar et al. 6 has previously investigated some triangulenium dyes as optical 
probes for nucleic acids of different topologies mainly G4 secondary structures, dsDNA (double 
stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) and ssDNA (single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid) by using 
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. They found that the diazaoxatriangulenium based 
DAOTAM2 showed better nucleus targeting with a significant enhancement of the fluorescence 
lifetime after binding with Gquadruplexes, in comparison to other forms of nucleic acids. Furthermore, Lacour et al.
