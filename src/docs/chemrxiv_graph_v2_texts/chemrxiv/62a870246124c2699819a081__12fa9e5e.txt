Description:
A possible product of CO2 reduction by 4 electrons and 4 protons.

climate change.46 CO2 can be reduced to C1 
products and lighter Cn hydrocarbons using water gas shift reaction and other direct hydrogenation 
methods which are require expensive H2 andor high temperatures and pressures.712 Alternatively, 
notable reports on efficient electrocatalysts or photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 has appeared 
in the past few years which uses electrical or light energy for the reduction of CO2 akin to natural 
photosynthesis.1318 Out of these several electrocatalysts are based on easily available first row 
transition metals and have attractive catalytic rates and low overpotentials.16,1921 An persistent 
problem with CO2 reduction is the possibility of forming multiple products as CO2 can be reduced to 
COHCOOH (by 2e2H), HCHO (by 4e4H), CH3OH (by 6e6H) and CH4 (by 8e8H).2,22 Even though 
these products require different number of electrons and protons, their standard potentials vary over 
a narrow range of 0.24 to 0.61 V vs NHE at pH 7 (Figure 1).2 The fact that the competing proton 
reduction also entails similar potential (Figure 1), jeopardizes the selectivity of the reduction process 
i.e.
