Description:
A system synthesized using cyclization of truxillic acid amides.

Text:
Notably, somewhat related approach, i.e., cyclization of 
truxillic acid amides, was used in the very first synthesis of 3
azabicyclo3.1.1heptane system reported over a century ago.28 
The key intermediate obtained in our work  bicyclic imide 2  was 
transformed into a series of 1amino3azabicyclo3.1.1heptane 
derivatives, including monoprotected diamine building blocks 3 
and 4, as well as bicyclic analogs of Thalidomide. This classical 
medication is currently used to treat a variety of cancers; recently, 
it has attracted much attention in design of proteolysistargeting 
chimeras (PROTACs) due to its action as a cereblon E3 ligase 
ligand.29
