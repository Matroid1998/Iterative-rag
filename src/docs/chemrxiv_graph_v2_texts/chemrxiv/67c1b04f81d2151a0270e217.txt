Description:
Detailed information on iron oxidation and spin states is offered by Mssbauer spectroscopy.

Text:
Due to a pyrolysis step in their preparation, FeNC catalysts
are amorphous materials and thus knowledge about the struc
tural composition of their active site(s) is limited5,6,1114,16. Nucleispecific spectroscopy methods, such as Xray absorption
spectroscopy9,12,14,17,18 or Mssbauer spectroscopy5,6,11,1923
are thus required for structural elucidation. Because of the de
tailed information on iron oxidation and spin states offered by
Mssbauer spectroscopy, it has been used especially extensively
to study FeNC catalysts. A Mssbauer doublet signal is charac
terized by the isomer shift and the quadrupole splitting.

Description:
Atoms are surrounded by a fourfold nitrogen coordination sphere embedded in a carbon matrix.

Text:
The
isomer shift depends linearly on the selectron density at the
nucleus, while the quadrupole splitting is defined by the elec
tric field gradient, making it highly sensitive to the symme
try of the electron distribution around the nucleus.2427 Both
Mssbauer parameters show a temperature dependence, mak
ing low temperature experiments on FeNC catalysts highly rele
vant for comparisons with computational data that are formally
carried out at 0 K.6,28
The currently dominant perspective on active sites in FeNC
catalysts is that iron atoms are surrounded by a fourfold nitro
gen coordination sphere that are embedded in a carbon ma
trix, which is assumed to be graphenelike5,6,11,12,14,2022,29.
