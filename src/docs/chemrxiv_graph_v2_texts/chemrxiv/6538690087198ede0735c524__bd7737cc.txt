Various synthesis 
methods have been investigated with the aid of advanced 
nanostructural analysis for nanostructured carbon materials, in
cluding arc discharge,10 template carbonization,2,11 conversion of 
graphene oxides12,13 to their reduced analog,13,14 fine organic 
synthesis,15,16 topochemical pyrolysis,1719 and chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD).2024 Consequently, many advanced carbon 
materials, including carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 
graphenes, structural graphite, and carbon foams have been de
veloped with improved physicochemical properties, and they are 
growing at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 6 
with an annual global market of 3 billion USD in 2015.25 They 
are extensively used as adsorbents,26 catalysts,2733 and catalyst 
supports,34 conductive additives,3537 and anode materials38 in 
batteries, supercapacitors,39,40 polymerelectrolyte fuel cells 
(PEFCs),41 and photothermal conversion.42 
In this context, the chemical science of twodimensional (2D) 
graphene and its zerodimensional (0D) and onedimensional 
(1D) analogs have been extensively studied in recent decades.
