Hexagonal manganites, RMnO3 (R  Sc, Y, HoLu), can reversibly absorb large amounts of oxygen as 
interstitial ions below 400 C,1721 and are thus promising oxygen storage materials (OSMs) for oxygen 
separation, e.g. through chemical looping air separation (CLAS).

Description:
Has a high reversible oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and is involved in oxygen surface exchange rates.

Text:
Such applications require materials with a 
high reversible oxygen storage capacity (OSC), fast bulk ion transport and oxygen surface exchange rates.22
24 However, the oxidation kinetics of these materials are generally slow, with time to full oxidation on the scale 
of several hours.25 This implies a smaller available OSC when using short dwell times or fast heating and 
cooling rates,20,2530 which are both necessary for efficient O2 gas production by cyclic processes like CLAS.23 
Both the OSC and oxidation kinetics of RMnO3 are known to improve with larger R3 cations, either as the 
sole Rsite cation or as a substituted element in YMnO3,19,25,26,2833 or through aliovalent doping, e.g.
