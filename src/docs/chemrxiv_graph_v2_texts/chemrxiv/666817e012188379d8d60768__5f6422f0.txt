Description:
Used in asymmetric three-component arylative cross-coupling with alkenes.

Text:
This unique blueprint lays the foundation 
for the development of an asymmetric threecomponent arylative crosscoupling of alkenes using aryl bromides or two distinct Csp2 
and Csp3halides, as demonstrated by elegant recent examples independently reported by Diao, Nevado, and Chu.11 
Pioneered by Molander and MacMillan,12,13 many groups have reported a range of redoxactive precursors that are amenable to 
singleelectrontransfer (SET) oxidation to form alkyl carbon radicals, which serve as formal nucleophiles to participate in two9d,14 
and threecomponent15 arylative radical crosscouplings under synergistic photoredox and nickel catalysis (Figure 1B, c). Owing to 
the redoxneutral conditions, these approaches provide wider substrate scope for the construction of diverse chiral molecules that 
feature (hetero)arylsubstituted stereogenic centers without the necessity for an external reductant.
