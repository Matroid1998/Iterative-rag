Description:
A 2D material known for its complex electronic and spintronic phenomena.

Text:
Since the discovery of monolayer graphene in
2004,1,2 the door for the new families of ex
foliable materials has been opened and the
number of 2dimensional (2D) materials as
well as the attention they draw has seen ex
ponential growth.3,4 Materials that consist of
2D layers bonded by van der Waals forces are
of particular interest due to the wide variety of
complex electronic and spintronic phenomena
that can be engineered in thinfilm devices. Graphene5,6 and hexagonal boron nitride (h
