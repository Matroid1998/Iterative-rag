Description:
A polymer that can be manipulated using thermophoretic motion.

in 2002, who demonstrated the manipulation of DNA by inducing 
thermophoretic motion through the localized heating of an aqueous solution with a focused near
infrared laser.4 In principle, a temperature gradient of 105 to 106 K m1 is required to induce the 
thermophoresis. By focusing laser light with an objective lens, a heating spot with a diameter of 
approximately 1 m can be achieved,57 readily providing the necessary temperature gradient. A 
wide range of entities, including DNA,4 polystyrene and silica microparticles,8 plasmonic 
nanoparticles,6 Janus nanoparticles,911 surfactant micelles,12 polymers such as polyethylene 
glycol,13 vesicles,14 and E. coli bacteria,15 have been manipulated using MST in liquids. However, a significant challenge in studying MST in liquids is the lack of a comprehensive 
theoretical framework to fully explain this phenomenon.
