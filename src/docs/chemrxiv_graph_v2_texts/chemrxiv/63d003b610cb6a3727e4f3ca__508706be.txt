Description:
A cofactor used by half of documented oxidoreductases in bioelectrocatalysis.

Text:
Recently there has been a significant expansion in the use of bioelectrocatalysis for 
environmentally friendly organic synthesis.1 In bioelectrocatalysis, redox enzymes drive highly 
selective redox reactions under mild aqueous conditions, and the corresponding enzyme cofactor 
is regenerated with an electrode as the terminal oxidantreductant. One cofactor, nicotinamide 
adenine 
dinucleotide 
(phosphate) 
(NAD(P)NAD(P)H), 
holds 
special 
appeal 
for 

bioelectrocatalysis, because it is used by half of documented oxidoreductases2; however, its 
commercial utilization is limited by its high cost.
