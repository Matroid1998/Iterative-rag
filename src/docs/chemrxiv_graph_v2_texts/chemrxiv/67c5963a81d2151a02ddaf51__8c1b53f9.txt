Description:
Partly methylesterified at O6 position and acetylesterified at O2 or O3.

Text:
In detail, the polymer is made of repeating units of (1  4)a 
DGalA (galactopyranosyluronic acid) residues, partly methylesterified at O6 position and to 
a lower extent also acetylesterified at O2 or O3, interrupted by branched regions composed 
of (1  2)alrhamnose units (RGI regions) further binding neutral sugars including galactose, 
arabinose, xylose, and fructose.1 The RGI and RGII hairy regions are structurally similar in 
different fruit and vegetable tissues.2
