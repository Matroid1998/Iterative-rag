Description:
Involved in reduction processes and can be split into CO and O.

Text:
As 
one example, many functionals strongly overbind CO at the hollow site on TM surfaces.5 Such uncertainty 
hampers the informative and predictive nature of theoretical studies on CO2 reduction. How CO initially 
binds to the substrate is an essential component in the initial step for processes such as CO2 splitting into 
CO and O. If already the site preference of the initial step of the reaction process cannot be resolved to 
the required accuracy, modeling the entire reaction process remains in doubt. That being said, even while 
we find DFT energies are not reliable, we will show that DFT predictions of the structure (bond lengths) 
are much less variable between functionals, and align much better with available experimental data.
