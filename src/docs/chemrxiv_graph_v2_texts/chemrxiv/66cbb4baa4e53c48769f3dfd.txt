Description:
Involved in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.

So, here Haikal,R.R., et al, 12 reported
an approach to synthesized hybrid ultramicroporous material (HUM) precursor to grapheneembbeded tetrataenite as superb
highly active and durable nonprecious group (NPG) metals for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Indeed,
the authors well demonstrated the improvement in the properties of the designed materials. So, after Raman spectroscopy
analysis, it was founded that the ratio (IDIG) is about 1.562 of the graphitic carbon in the designed materials while normally
the unmodified graphene or ordered graphite has (IDIG) ratio of around 11.2. thus this indicate a higher degree of disorder
in the synthesized catalyst.
