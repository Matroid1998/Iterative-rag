Description:
Undergoes CH sulfenylation with electrophilic sulfenyl chlorides.

Typically, general 
bioconjugation reactions on Cys utilize alkylation of the nucleophilic thiol2 or metalcatalyzed 
coupling of the thiol with aryl halides.3 Umpolung strategies of the nucleophilic thiol have also become 
an alternative coupling format.4 In terms of Trpmodification, a variety of indoleselective reactions 
have been utilized that include transition metal,5 metal carbenoid,6 or radicalmediated reaction.7,8 
The CH sulfenylation of indole with electrophilic sulfenyl chlorides,9 such as Schlorocysteine or its 
congener, represents an interresidue selective conjugation between Trp and Cys residues, that requires 
the oxidative umpolung to the Schlorocysteine using harmful chlorination agents such as sulfuryl 
chloride (SO2Cl2).10 Accordingly, these reactions are not compatible with the presence of Trp. Recently, 
we have developed interresidue selective reactions between Cys and Trp residues.

Description:
Participates in aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions.

In these reactions, 
the 
Spmethoxybenzyl 
or 
Sacetamidomethyl 
cysteine 
sulfoxide 
(Cys(MBzl)(O) 
or 
Cys(Acm)(O))11,12 moieties are converted to the corresponding Schlorocysteine under acidic 
conditions using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as solvent in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride 
(GnHCl) or diisopropylamine hydrochloride (DAHCl). The resulting electrophilic species 
participate in aromatic electrophilic substitution (SEAr) reactions with indole to achieve the CH 
sulfenylation of the Trp (Figure 1).12 Here, GnHCl or DAHCl is indispensable for the reaction, 
because they function as cation scavengers (amine part) and chloride anion source. TFA activates the 
sulfoxide to a sulfonium cation and assists in liberating the protecting group (P) as a cation from the 
resulting sulfonium intermediate. The use of sulfoxide enables the oxidantfreeacidmediated
