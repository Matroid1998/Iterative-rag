A scaffold suitable for maintaining high OX1R affinity.

Text:
of the fluorobenzothiazole scaffold (1f) would be suitable for maintaining 
high OX1R affinity. After multistep synthesis of 1a1f, in vitro OXR binding studies 
confirmed molecular dynamics calculations and revealed singledigit nanomolar OX1R 
affinities for 1af, ranging from 0.69 nM2.5 nM. The benzothiazole 1f showed high 
OX1R affinity (Ki  0.69 nM), along with 77fold subtype selectivity over OX2R. Cu
mediated 18Ffluorination of the nonselective OXR ligands benzothiazole 18F1c and 
quinoxaline 18F1d yielded RCY of 44 and 56, respectively, after 10 min,
