Description:
Can be generated as singlet oxygen through a photocatalytic pathway.

The use of light as a source for the activation of reactants can be a sustainable 
alternative to the conventional use of thermochemical activation1, for instance for cross
coupling reactions2. Light can also be used to access reactive intermediates under milder 
conditions, e.g., the photocatalytic pathway to generate singlet oxygen or trifluoromethyl 
radicals3. Various studies have already illustrated the potential for the synthesis of fine 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals through photochemical means46; however, one of the 
challenges which prevents the ubiquitous use of this technology is that organic molecules 
tend to only absorb photons in the ultraviolet (UV) region.
