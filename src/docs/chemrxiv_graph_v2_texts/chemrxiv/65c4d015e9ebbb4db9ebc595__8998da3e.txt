Description:
Metalbound alkyl groups can undergo protonation at very low temperature to form alkane complexes.

In pursuit of understand
ing this unusual bonding configuration, a rich literature of com
plexes, in which alkane CH bonds act as ligands bound to a 
metal center, has emerged over the decades3,57. Various routes exist towards preparation of alkane com
plexes. Direct preparation in the solid state has been achieved 
by hydrogenation of metalbound alkenes8,9 as well as in solu
tion via protonation of a metalbound alkyl group at very low 
temperature10. The most common routes to preparing alkane 
complexes, however, are photochemical ones3 (see Scheme 1). The photoinduced elimination of a ligand from certain transi
tion metal complexes leads to the creation of an 
undercoordinated and highly reactive species capable of bind
ing an alkane from solution.
