Description:
A sequence that can combine different nucleic acid types, such as DNARNA chimeric sequences.

The ability 
to easily synthesize nucleic acids provided by this chemistry is among the most important advances in biological 
chemistry of the last century and constitutes a core technology underlying much of modern biological research. Consisting of repeated cycles containing coupling, oxidation, and deblocking steps, the chemistry allows for fully 
automated synthesis using phosphoramidite building blocks. The shared chemistry allows most nucleic acids to be 
synthesized using similar cycles, and for different nucleic acid types to be combined within an oligonucleotide to 
yield, for example, DNARNA chimeric sequences, or oligonucleotides labeled via fluorescent phosphoramidites.
