Description:
Used as a roughened foam anode for the oxidation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural to 5hydroxymethyl2furancarboxylic acid.

Text:
In 
2020, Wang and coworkers demonstrated high selectivity (100 FE to H2) at industrially 
relevant current density (100 mAcm2) and low cell voltage (0.27 V) during oxidation of 5
hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 5hydroxymethyl2furancarboxylic acid, (HMFCA) on a 
roughened Cu foam anode.10 Higher activity than monometallic Cu has been achieved 
primarily with Cubased bimetallics such as CuAg5 and CuPt.11
