Description:
A greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to annual emissions.

Text:
The chemical sector accounts for a significant share of the total greenhouse gas emissions as the production requires 
tremendous amounts of energy, and the vast majority of commercially available organic chemicals are sourced from fossil 
fuelderived feedstock.1 Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction is a promising approach for sequestering CO2 while 
producing highvalue chemicals like ethylene (C2H4), which currently contributes to 862 Mt of the annual CO2 emissions.2 
However, for CO2 electrolysis to be an economically feasible production method for e.g. C2H4, the energy efficiencies must 
reach levels beyond 50 while exhibiting operating lifetimes of thousands of hours.2,3 One of the most promising 
engineering configurations is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) due to its relatively low ohmic loss and easy 
scalability.
