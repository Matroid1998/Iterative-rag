Description:
Polymers reported in patents 1012.

Text:
Several patents reported making of photographic materials involving 
propyl MPCA 8, 9. Tertbutyl cyanoacrylate polymers are reported in 1012. Earlier we have reported synthesis and styrene copolymerization of a number of alkoxy 
ringsubstituted methyl 1315, ethyl 16, 17, propyl 18, isopropyl 19, butyl 20, 
isobutyl 21, 2methoxyethyl 22, and octyl 23 phenylcyanoacrylates. Thus, in continuation of our investigation of novel TSE compounds we have prepared 
tertbutyl alkoxyphenylcyanoacrylates (APCA), RPhCHC(CN)CO2C(CH3)3, where R is 2
methoxy, 3methoxy, 4methoxy, 2ethoxy, 3ethoxy, 4ethoxy, 4propoxy, 4butoxy, 4
hexyloxy, and explored the feasibility of their copolymerization with styrene. To the best of 
our knowledge, except synthesis of tertbutyl 4methoxyphenylcyanoacrylate 24, there 
have been no reports on either synthesis of these compounds, nor their copolymerization 
with styrene 25. 3
