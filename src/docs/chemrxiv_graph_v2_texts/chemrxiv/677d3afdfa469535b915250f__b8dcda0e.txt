Functional groups used in polymerization.

Text:
Other promising methods, such as Aldol condensa
tion, have successfully produced lowbandgap, highperfor
mance semiconducting polymers presenting low LUMO lev
els with minimal waste.29 However, this reaction is limited 
by the functional groups required for polymerization, which 
are less versatile compared to halogens or organotins and 
harder to install on every aromatic building block of inter
est. To overcome these limitations, innovative approaches 
are needed, which consist of strategies that enable precise 
polymer structures with minimal waste and purification are 
particularly attracting.1,3032 Such novel polymerization 
methodologies have been pursued with success. A family of 
material answering some of these requirements is dynamic 
covalent iminebased conjugated polymers.33,34 These
