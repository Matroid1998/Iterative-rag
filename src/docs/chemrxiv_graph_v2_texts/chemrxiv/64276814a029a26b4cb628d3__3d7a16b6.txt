Description:
An ethylating agent characterized as a severely potent transplacental teratogen and carcinogen in rodents.

Exposure to carcinogens is associated with different forms of DNA damage 
which includes singlestand breaks, doublestrand breaks, covalently bound chemical DNA adducts, 
oxidativeinduced lesions and DNADNA or DNAprotein crosslinks6. NNitrosoNethyl urea (NEU), an ethylating agent has been traditionally characterized as a severely 
potent transplacental teratogen and carcinogen in rodents 7. Vernonia amygdalina is traditionally used to treat a variety of diseases including fungal and bacterial 
infections, inflammation, cancer, diabetes, and wounds8. V. amygdalina is rich in phytochemicals. Some 
of the identified phytochemicals of V. amygdalina responsible for its medicinal uses include alkaloids, 
saponins, terpenes, lignans, flavonoids, phenolic acids, steroids, anthraquinone, coumarins, 
sesquiterpenes, xanthones and edotides 9.
