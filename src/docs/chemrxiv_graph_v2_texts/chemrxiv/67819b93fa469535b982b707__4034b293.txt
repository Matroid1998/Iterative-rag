Description:
Involved in fast exciton diffusion mediated by intermolecular interactions.

Text:
By 
scanning over multiple photoexcitation positions, TAM is capable of tracking exciton transport 
dynamics with 50 nm spatial precision and femtosecond temporal resolution.26 Previous TAM 
studies in tetracene crystals revealed a cooperative transport mechanism, in which the effective 
triplet exciton diffusion constant is enhanced by an order of magnitude by a singletmediated 
transport mechanism.24,27 More recently, TAM has been used to identify the role of intermolecular 
interactions in mediating fast exciton diffusion in tethered perylene bisimide derivatives28 and 
perylene diimide derivatives.29 These works provide direct evidence that increasing intermolecular
