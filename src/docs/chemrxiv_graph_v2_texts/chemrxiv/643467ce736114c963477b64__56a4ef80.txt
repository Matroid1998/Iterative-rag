Description:
Reacts with carbon to add carbon atoms.

The NPtoNP variations in initial etching rates and in 
the evolution of NP reactivity over time would have 
been averaged out in ensemble measurements, and their 
observation was enabled by development of the single 
NP mass spectrometry method that is also used in the 
present study. Here, rather than etching material from 
the NPs, we examine the kinetics of carbon addition via 
reaction with C2H2. Carbon nanoparticles (NPs) can have many different 
morphologies, including graphitic, diamond, carbon 
black, and fullerenenanoonion structure. Graphitic 
NPs (Fig. 1a), comprise layers of inert basal planes with 
undercoordinated reactive sites at the basal plane edges. Primary carbon black NPs (Fig.
