Description:
Stable bioconjugates formed from the reaction of ethynylbenziodoxolones with tyrosine.

of hypervalent iodine onto biomolecules under physiological conditions. Tyrosine residues were engaged in 
a selective addition onto the alkynyl bond of ethynylbenziodoxolones (EBX), resulting in stable vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) bioconjugates. The methodology 
was successfully applied to peptides and proteins and tolerated all other nucleophilic residues, with the exception of cysteine. The generated VBX were further 
functionalized by palladiumcatalyzed crosscoupling and azidealkyne cycloaddition reactions. The method could be successfully used to modify bioactive 
natural products and native streptavidin to enable thiolmediated cellular uptake.
