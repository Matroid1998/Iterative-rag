Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries for its high theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential.

Text:
Highenergy density, portable and safe energy storage remains one of the most prevalent issues in 
modern society. Lithiumion batteries (LIB) are amongst the most promising options but are far from 
achieving their theoretical performance13. Maximal energy density of lithium batteries can only be 
achieved by use of Li metal anodes, which enable the highest theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g1) and 
the lowest electrochemical potential (3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode) of all anode 
materials1, 
2. However, current LIB electrolytes (usually LiPF6 dissolved in a ethylene 
carbonatedimethyl carbonate22) are incompatible with Li metal, present with safety concerns and an 
inability to accommodate high V cathode materials. Hence, electrolyte optimisation, or replacement, 
is paramount1, 2, 48.

Description:
Used in lithium garnets as a solid-state electrolyte due to its wide electrochemical window and chemical stability with lithium metal.

Text:
All solidstate batteries (ASSBs) are natural successors to current LIBs, as they could enable Li metal 
anodes, wider electrochemical windows and improved safety9. However, the development of a 
suitable solidstate electrolyte (SSE) has proved troublesome. To date many oxide and sulphide SSEs 
have been studied, but often have a high ionic conductivity or a wide electrochemical window, but 
rarely both6, 915. Finding a suitable SSE is, therefore, a key challenge to enable the next generation of 
energy storage9. Lithium garnets have emerged as contenders for use as an SSE, owing to a wide electrochemical 
window (06V vs LiLi), chemical stability with Li metal and (in recent years) high ionic conductivity ( 
0.1 mS cm1)1640.
