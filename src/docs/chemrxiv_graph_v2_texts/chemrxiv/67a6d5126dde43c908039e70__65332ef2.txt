Inspired by this 
research, Ngui et al.35 broke the symmetry of cyclo2ncarbon (n  512) by 
functionalizing the molecules with one BN unit and found that these hybrid molecules 
exhibit high performance in both linear and nonlinear optics, potentially offering 
promising applications for electronics and optoelectronics. Individual and scattered studies on the optical properties of BN substituted 
cyclocarbons of different sizes emphasize the positive effect of the BN unit, but 
systematic research on the optoelectronic properties of the hybrid ring with CC units 
sequentially replaced by BN units appears not yet conducted thus far. Considering the 
unique optical properties of C18 and the potential regulatory role of BN unit on the
