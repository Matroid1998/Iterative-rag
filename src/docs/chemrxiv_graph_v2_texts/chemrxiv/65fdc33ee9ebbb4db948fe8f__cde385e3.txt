Description:
A two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide with high optical absorption and active catalytic sites.

Text:
Twodimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) are fundamentally fascinating 
and chemically versatile materials for a variety of applications.1,2 Among various TMDs, 
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been intensively investigated due to its extraordinary 
intrinsic properties such as high optical absorption, active catalytic sites, high Youngs 
modulus and Seebeck coefficient.
