Description:
Also known as Azidothymidine, an anti-HIV/AIDS drug that induces DNA damage predominantly at thymine and cytosine residues in the presence of Cu(II).

The latter dissociation involved with breaking of two CC bonds is an important process 
for repairing DNA lesion.3,4 Oxidative chemistry of thymine on DNA creating a radical cation via loss of 
an electron was less explored because tutorially reaction occurs primarily at guanines because they 
have low oxidation potentials (Eox) and primary oxidation at thymine resulted to DNA cleavage was 
only observed in guanine poor regions.5,6 However, it was reported7 (Figure 1) that UVBexposed 
thyminecontaining antiHIVAIDS drug Azidothymidine (AZT, also known as Zidovudine) induced DNA 
damage predominantly at thymine and cytosine residues in the presence of Cu(II) at the 5ACG3 
sequence, complementary to a hot spot of the p53 tumor suppressor gene with piperidine treatment; 
and the concurrent formation of 8oxodG via oxidation of guanine did not lead to DNA cleavage.
