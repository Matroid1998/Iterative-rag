Chemicals used as cleaning agents, emulsifiers, preservatives, algicides, cosmetic additives, antiseptics, and disinfectants.

Quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) are a group of chemicals manufactured and used on a mass 
42 
scale around the world. Their favorable surface properties and biological activity have resulted 
43 
in decades of use as cleaning agents, emulsifiers, preservatives, algicides, cosmetic additives, 
44 
as well as antiseptics and disinfectants (Arnold et al., 2023; De et al., 2015). However, the 
45 
increasing use of conventional, fully synthetic QASs, particularly evident in recent years due 
46 
to the COVID19 pandemic (Arnold et al., 2023), represents a significant environmental burden 
47 
due to their limited biodegradability, accumulation tendencies (Pati and Arnold, 2020) and their 
48 
very high toxicity toward organisms present in water and soil (Badmus et al., 2021; 
49 
Kaczerewska et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2015).
