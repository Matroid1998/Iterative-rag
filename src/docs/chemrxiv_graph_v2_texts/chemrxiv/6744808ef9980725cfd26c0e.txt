A 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl group used in the synthesis of Zn TPyzPz FANs.

bulky substituents distorts phthalocyanines to be saddle
shaped structures,11 we assumed that 2D and 3D FANs can be 
synthesized from tetracyanodihydrodipyrazinopyrazines (TCDP) 
depending on the size of the substituents (Fig. 1b). Herein, we 
report the synthesis of Zn TPyzPz FANs bearing 1ethylpropyl 
and 2,4,6trimethylphenyl (mesityl) groups. The crystallinity of 
the obtained solids was investigated by Xray diffraction and the 
progress of the polymerization reaction was confirmed by using 
IR, solidstate 13C NMR, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The thermal stability and porosity of the polymers were also 
measured by thermogravimetric analysis and adsorption
desorption experiments, respectively. a. Institute
