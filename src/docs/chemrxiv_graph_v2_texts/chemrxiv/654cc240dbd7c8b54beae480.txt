Description:
An ion involved in exchange interactions with varying ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling constants.

Text:
Given the potential for multiple ( 12) exchange interactions, and numerous g and D values, 
even greatly simplified models can prove computationally demanding. In general, extracting exchange 
coupling constants (J) has been achieved using a model which assumes just two interactions (Figure 1), 
one between the central Ni ion and the Ni ions in the outer ring (Jcr) and one between neighbouring Ni 
ions around the ring (Jrr). However, there is no agreement regarding the nature and magnitude of these 
values for those complexes exhibiting competing ferro and antiferromagnetic exchange, despite the 
presence of similar NiXNi angles. Some reports suggest Jcr is ferromagnetic and Jrr is antiferromagnetic, 
and others state Jcr is antiferromagnetic and Jrr is ferromagnetic.
