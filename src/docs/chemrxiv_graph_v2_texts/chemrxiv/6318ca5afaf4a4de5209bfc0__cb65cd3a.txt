Description:
A chromophore used in systems with photocleaving wavelengths around 365 nm.

Photodynamic hydrogels take advantage of lights 
spatiotemporal control to trigger photoinduced material softening20,21, biochemical release2224, 
and species uncagingactivation for in vivo material modification25. Despite the early promise of phototunable gels, chemistry and materialbased limitations have 
precluded the full power of these platforms from being realized2. Reliance on organic 
chromophores to encode photodegradability within hydrogels has historically confined the 
photocleaving wavelengths to highenergy light  ranging from 365 nm for orthonitrobenzyl 
(oNB)based systems up to 450 nm for some reported photolabile coumarins and bimanes2628. While some of these chromophores have been highly characterized and are cytocompatible 
throughout photolysis, the utilization of UV light irradiation has traditionally confined these 
materials to solely in vitro use as highenergy light is poorly penetrant through complex
