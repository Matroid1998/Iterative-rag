Description:
Coupling partners in allylation chemistry with high reactivity.

Text:
A range 
18 
of such reactivity has been investigated with aldehyde (or maskedaldehyde) coupling partners, initially by 
19 
Mori5 and Le Gendre and Mose6 before being extensively developed by the groups of Krische712 and 
20 
others13,14 as a contemporary revolution of classical allylation chemistry. However, ketones remain 
21 
challenging in all but a few limited cases (see below),15 likely due to their lower electrophilicity and increased 
22 
steric demands relative to aldehydes. 23 
Two notable solutions to this problem have been developed. Buchwald and coworkers,1619 and also later 
24 
Xiong and coworkers,20 reported the coppercatalysed, enantioselective allylation of ketones with 1,3
25 
dienes which proceeds through a ZimmermanTraxler type transition state (Scheme 1b). As a result, 
26 
branched rather than linear products are obtained.
