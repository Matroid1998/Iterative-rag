Description:
Used in bioimaging as fluorescent carbon dots.

Nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively studied over the past decades due to their unique 
chemical and physical properties.1 Their intrinsic optical properties, in particular, have been 
widely exploited in biomedical applications.2 For example, fluorescent nanoparticles such as 
quantum dots (QD) and carbon dots (CD) are used in bioimaging.3,4 Additionally, plasmonic 
nanoparticles, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), are 
applied in photothermal therapy5, drug delivery6 and sensing,7 owing to their strong light 
absorption, with extinction coefficients exceeding 108 M1 cm1, arising from their Localized 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR).8 Other nanoparticles, including dyedoped latex beads, 
cellulose nanobeads, and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), are also used in various 
biomedical applications and can exhibit interesting, though more limited, optical properties.9 
For biomedical applications, nanoparticles must possess several key features.
