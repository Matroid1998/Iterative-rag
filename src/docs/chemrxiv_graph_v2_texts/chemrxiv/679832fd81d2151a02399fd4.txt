Description:
Characterized by a disordered carbonaceous matrix of randomly oriented graphitic layers.

Meeting these demands, hard carbon (HC) has emerged as 
the most promising anode material for commercial NIBs due to its high capacity, electrochemical 
stability, low cost, and the abundance of its precursors (e.g., biomass). However, a general mech
anism for sodium storage in HC  critical for widescale commercialization  has been elusive 
because of the complexity and sensitivity of storage mechanisms to HC microstructure. The microstructure of HC is characterized by a disordered carbonaceous matrix of ran
domly oriented graphitic layers.79 Structural features such as large graphene interlayer spacing,
