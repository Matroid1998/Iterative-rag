Description:
Has good thermal, chemical, and electrochemical stability, making it suitable for LIBs.

For example, lithium bis 
(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI) has good thermal 18, chemical and 
electrochemical stability, which makes it a good candidate for LIBs. In addition, LiTFSI 
readily dissolves in various kinds of electrolytic solvents, which gives higher ionic 
conductivity at room temperature (e. g., ca. 102 Scm1 in ECDMC). Nevertheless, LiTFSI is 
corrosive towards Al current collector, limiting its application as main conducting salt for 
LIBs 19, 20. Another structural analogue of the TFSI anion is the FSI anion. The 
FSI anion has been studied as a component of ILs 21. The FSI anion containing ILs
