Description:
Exhibits a high relative rate for intramolecular ring-opening reactions.

Text:
A fundamental concept in organic chemistry is ring strain,1,2 which is used to explain 
the heightened reactivity of threemembered rings due to deviations from ideal bond angles.3 
Consequently, strain release has been widely employed in organic synthesis as a powerful tactic 
to increase reaction rates, finding applications in total synthesis,4 polymer science,5,6 
bioconjugation7,8 bioisosterism;9,10 it is also an important concept in biosynthesis (Figure 1a).11 
However, despite the common belief that such pentup strain energy fully explains the reactivity of 
species such as small rings, cycloalkynes and cyclo(E)alkenes, even the simplest of these 
systems presents a paradox cyclopropanes display markedly heightened ringopening reactivity 
compared to cyclobutanes (krel(cyclopropane)  104107 for intramolecular ringopening 
reactions),12 despite having nearly identical strain energies (27.5 and 26.5 kcal mol1 
respectively).3 
This puzzle has been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations.

Description:
Relieves a larger proportion of angle strain (75) upon ring opening.

Text:
Stirling et al.13 
proposed that cyclopropane relieves a larger proportion of angle strain (75) than cyclobutane 
(50) upon ringopening, while the groups of Hoz14 and Houk15 argued that differences in 
electronic structure (i.e., bonding) are instead the cause of the reactivity difference. Hoz proposed
