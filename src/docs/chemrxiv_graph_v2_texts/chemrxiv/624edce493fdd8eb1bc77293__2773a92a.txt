Description:
Used as a promoter in the presence of light for activation.

Text:
During the iodine 
catalysis, radical chain is formed that works within the various oxidation states of iodine (IIII). This method is an efficient and provide alternative to the conventional metalcatalyzed 
transformations. However, OBroin et al in 2016,15 presented an efficient method for the 
intramolecular C(sp3)H bonds amination of aliphatic compounds in the presence of N
Iodosuccinimide (NIS) as a promoter. Light was used as source for activation of promotor. This
