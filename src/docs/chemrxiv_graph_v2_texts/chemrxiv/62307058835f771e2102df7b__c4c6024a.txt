Description:
Chromophores that could serve as blue or even green fluorescence protein markers.

Text:
Azaindoles are heterobicyclic aromatic organic compounds consisting of a pyrrole ring 
fused to a pyridine ring. Being structurally different from indole only by one additional nitrogen 
in the sixmembered pyridine ring, the azaindole moiety exhibits interesting biochemical and 
pharmacological activities.1, 2 Scientists identified that methylated azaindole chromophores 
could serve as blue or even green fluorescence protein markers.3 Among various structural 
isomers of nazaindole, 7azaindole derivatives (see Figure 1 for the atom numbering) are 
excellent blue emitters for organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs).4
