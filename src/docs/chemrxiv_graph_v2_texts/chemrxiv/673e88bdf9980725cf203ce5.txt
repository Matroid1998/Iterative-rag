Description:
A mechanoresponsive compound where force affects spatial alignment between chromophores, altering photoluminescent properties.

For example, Weder and Sagara 
have introduced rotaxane and cyclophanebased mechano
phores where force affects the spatial alignment between chro
mophores and alters their photoluminescent properties.4952 
Saito and coworkers have pioneered flapping mechanophores 
that undergo conformational planarization under mechanical 
stimulation that extends the conjugation length.53,54 Moreover, 
the research groups of Matile5558, Sommer,59 and Lu60 have in
novated twisted conjugated systems that planarize and gain con
jugation efficiency under force. Other strategies for forcein
duced noncovalent processes include mechanical manipulation 
of supramolecular interactions in synthetic and biomaterials,61
63 and metalligand dissociation.64 However, most noncovalent 
physical changes provide transient signals that disappear when 
the force is removed.
