Description:
Used as a solvent for UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis.

As a representative procedure, the synthetic route for 3a is illustrated in Scheme 2. In accordance 
with our previous report, 1hydroxy9methoxydibenzoj,lfluoranthene (2b) was synthesised from the 
corresponding biaryl ketone 1b. After triflation of 2b, Pdcatalysed reduction of the resulted 5 in the 
presence of Et3SiH, followed by demethylation using BBr3, afforded 9hydroxyfluoranthene 3a. Compounds 2c and 3b,c were also synthesised from the common substrate 2b. Methyl ether 4 was 
also prepared from 2a. The chromic properties of hydroxyfluoranthenes 2a and 3a were analysed by UVvis and 
fluorescence spectroscopy under neutral, basic, and acidic conditions in CH2Cl2 solution (Figure 2). The absorption spectrum of 1hydroxy 2a exhibited two major bands at 400 nm (moderate) and 420
500 nm (broad, weak) under neutral conditions (Figure 2a).
