A class of molecules comprised of a nitrogen and boron atom covalently coordinated.

Text:
Aminoboranes (R2NBR2) are a class of molecules comprised of a 
nitrogen and boron atom covalently coordinated. The NB bond is 
further strengthened by donation from the nitrogen lone pair to 
the empty porbital on boron leading to an enthalpically favorable, 
partially sp2hybridized bond (Figure 1a).1 Since their discovery, 
aminoboranes have captivated chemists across a variety of disci
plines (Figure 1b). Unsubstituted aminoboranes have been of inter
est to materials chemists, who identified them as a promising source 
of H2 gas for use in fuel cells2 while aminoboranedoped poly aro
matic hydrocarbons have electronhole transport properties that are 
attractive to the semiconductor industry.3 In organic chemistry, chi
ral bicyclic aminoboranes are versatile enantioselective catalysts for 
numerous reductions and cycloadditions4 among other uses.5

Description:
Ambiphilic reagents used to introduce important groups onto organic molecules.

Text:
As such, synthetic chem
ists have begun investigating aminoboranes as ambiphilic reagents 
to introduce these important groups on to organic molecules 
(Figure 2).11 Fernndez and coworkers exploited the Lewis acidity 
of the boron group to reductively aminate enones through activation 
with sodium tertbutoxide (Figure 2A).12 Bertrand and coworkers 
exploited the reactivity of aminoboranes with aldehydes to generate 
aldimines that cannot be accessed through traditional routes (Figure 
2B).13 Unfortunately, both methods and other similar methods14 re
quire loss of the boron group as stoichiometric waste.
