Description:
Observed in the 19F NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture.

Text:
In this case, 15 TMSF was observed in the 19F NMR spectrum of the crude 
reaction mixture. Taken together, these results indicate that Mg salts could also promote 
the reaction in a way similar to that of Li salts, while the silyl enolate itself can also act 
as a fluoride scavenger in the absence of such salts. We found that less expensive and air
stable Ni(acac)2 also acts as a catalyst and slightly suppresses the generation of byproduct 
4 (entry 12). The catalyst and LiBr loadings could be reduced to 1 mol and 1 equiv., 
respectively (entry 13). Isolation of 3 using column chromatography on silica gel was hampered by 
protonation (Scheme S2).
