Description:
Involved in the formation of growing carbon chains in transition-metal-free Fischer-Tropsch chemistry.

Owing to environmental and economic reasons, the transformation and valorization of abundant and 
readily available chemical feedstock such as CO and CO2 are very topical goals.1 Carbon monoxide is a C1 
gas that is used in the industrial production of organic feedstock molecules such as methanol2 and acetic 
acid.3 Synthesis gas (syngas COH2) is converted into liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates on industrial 
scales by using the FischerTropsch (FT) process.4 As the CO triple bond is one of the strongest chemical 
bonds (bond dissociation energy of 1075 kJ.mol1),5 this process typically operates under harsh 
temperature and pressure conditions (200350 C, 2045 bars) using heterogeneous transition metal 
catalysts (Fe, Co).6 The precise mechanism in the formation of FT products is still under debate and, to 
gain more insight into the elementary steps involved, several organometallic complexes have been used 
as soluble models.7 Similarly, recent advances in transitionmetalfree FT chemistry have been reported, 
describing formation of growing carbon chains.8 
Although CO homologation has been observed by the coupling between two or more fragments 
upon insertion of CO into metalalkyl,9 aryl,10 hydride,11 imide12 or boryl bonds,13 the direct reductive 
coupling of CO molecules has only been achieved by a very limited number of systems, typically involving 
lowvalent oxophilicmetallic or nonmetallicelements.14 For example, homogeneous p15, and dblock 
compounds16 have been used to promote CO reductive coupling.
