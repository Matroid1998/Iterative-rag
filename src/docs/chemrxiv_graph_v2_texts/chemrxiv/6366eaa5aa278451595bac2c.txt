Description:
Undergoes photocatalytic nonoxidative dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen.

Text:
Photocatalytic nonoxidative dehydrogenation of anhydrous methanol can simultaneously obtain 
hydrogen and add the value of oxidation halfreaction, as compared with water splitting 1, 2. This 
strategy can also avoid the catalyst degradation that occurs at high temperature in conventional 
catalytic reaction 24. Like the common hole extraction occurred on picosecondnanosecond 
timescale 5, 6, photoinduced dehydrogenation of methanol over the semiconductors like TiO2 can 
also be efficient 7, 8. Despite of promising prospect, hydrogen evolution (HE), which is generally 
believed to be sufficiently fast in water splitting, however, slows the overall reaction 911. Photocatalytic HE mainly contains interfacial transfer of photogenerated electrons from 
semiconductor to cocatalyst and electrochemical transfer of these chargers to solution that are 
connected in series 1214.
