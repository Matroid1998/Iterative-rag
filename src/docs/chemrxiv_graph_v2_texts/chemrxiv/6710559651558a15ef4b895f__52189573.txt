Description:
A type of rechargeable battery being investigated for large-scale storage applications.

Text:
Great demand increases for largescale storage batteries to balance electricity supply and demand. Rechargeable batteries such as aqueous ZnAir and ZnMnO2 batteries are being actively investigated 
as promising candidates to meet these requirements. These Zn anode batteries usually contain no 
supporting electrolytes. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Znanode electrodepositiondissolution 
reaction without supporting electrolyte show linear response the redox current decreasesincreases 
linearly rather than exponentially. 1 In battery systems besides the Zn case, no supporting electrolyte 
is often added, and such linear responses are often observed in CVs of the electrodepositiondissolution 
reaction of metals. Compton group pointed out the importance of migration effect on CVs with weakly 
supporting electrolyte.
