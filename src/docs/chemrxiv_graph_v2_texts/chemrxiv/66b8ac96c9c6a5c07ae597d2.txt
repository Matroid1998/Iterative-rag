Description:
A cyclic neuropeptide hormone known to positively affect human behavior and social functioning and plays a pivotal role in initiating and maintaining uterine contractions during labor.

Due to its active site plastic
ity and large binding pocket, it can hydrolyze substrates of 
various sizes.3 Some examples include the small linear pep
tide Metenkephalin and large macrocyclic signaling pep
tides oxytocin and vasopressin.17 Especially important in 
this context is the cyclic neuropeptide oxytocin, a hormone 
known to positively affect human behavior and social func
tioning,18 and in childbirth where it plays a pivotal role in
itiating and maintaining uterine contractions during la
bor.19 
IRAP has also been identified as the angiotensin type 4 
(AT4) receptor20 it binds the linear hexapeptide angioten
sin IV, a metabolite of the hypertensive angiotensin II.21 
Although the predicted binding mode of angiotensin IV to 
IRAP is almost identical to that of oxytocin, it is not hydro
lyzed by IRAP;22 instead, it is a competitive inhibitor, with 
Ki in the high nanomolar range.
