Description:
A reactant that poses challenges due to unproductive polymerization or oxidation compared to aliphatic alkenes.

Text:
In this context, transition metal catalyzed direct 
trifluoromethylation has been employed for a long time to forge Cfluoroalkyl bonds.1b More recently, 
photocatalysis4 has turned out to be an interesting alternative to leverage the orthogonality of transition 
metal catalysis through the selective generation of a fluoroalkyl radical, which, in the presence of an 
appropriate reactant, will yield to the desired product.5 Although a plethora of methodologies have been 
developed in the last decade for the selective fluoroalkylation of aliphatic alkenes and alkynes under 
photoredox conditions6, the use of styrene reactants turns out to be particularly challenging. Indeed, 
unproductive polymerization or oxidation is favored in the latter compared to aliphatic alkenes, which 
constitutes a major hurdle towards more elaborate functionalization based on radical additions.

Description:
A compound used in nucleophilic trapping and hydrotrifluoromethylation reactions.

Text:
While 
nucleophilic trapping has been used for the functionalization of styrene, the hydrotrifluoromethylation of 
styrene derivatives has been scarcely studied. This challenge has been addressed by Choi et al.7 who used 
inorganic electride as a radical generator (3 equivalents) in their procedure to achieve this transformation. More recently, the group of Nol8 used an iridium based photocatalyst in the presence of 4
hydroxythiophenol as an external hydrogen donor in batch or continuous flow. It should be mentioned 
that both procedures made use of gaseous trifluoromethyl iodide. Figure 1. Reactivity of fluoroalkyl radicals with styrene and scope of this study.
