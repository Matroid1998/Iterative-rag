Description:
Produced via photocatalytic processes using NCNCNX and H2ases.

Text:
This method establishes a new 
benchmark 
for 
solar 
H2 
production, 
complemented 
by 
comprehensive interfacial characterizations utilizing a quartz 
crystal 
microbalance 
(QCM) 
and 
photoelectrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (PEIS). Specifically, we coupled 
negatively charged NCNCNX with H2ases containing different 
surface charges for in vitro photocatalytic H2 production without 
an external electron relay. The adsorption process of H2ases on 
NCNCNX is quantified by QCM, whereas PEIS provides insights 
into the charge carrier dynamics at the biomaterial interface. The NCNCNX photocatalysts were synthesized using melamine 
and potassium thiocyanate following previously published 
methods.2,4 Detailed synthesis procedures and characterizations, 
including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total 
reflectance Fouriertransform infrared (ATRFTIR) spectroscopy, 
fluorescence spectroscopy, and ultravioletvisible spectroscopy 
are provided in the supporting information (Figure S1S4).
