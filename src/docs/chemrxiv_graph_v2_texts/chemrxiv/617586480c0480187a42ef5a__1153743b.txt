Description:
Forms interfaces with the anode that can be thermodynamically stable, unstable, or metastable based on its chemical makeup.

In addition Several mechanisms are proposed for pathways for Li lament growth
in solid electrolytes. These mechanisms can be distinguished by the nature of the anode  SE
interface which can be (i) thermodynamically stable, (ii) unstable, and (iii) metastable based
on the chemical makeup of the SE4. A key underlying mechanism for all these types of inter
faces pertains to the limitations in mass transport of Li metal. Highrate electrodissolution
of the anode can lead to formation of pores at the anode  SE interface21,14. On a subse
quent electrodeposition step, the pores act as magniers of electric eld leading to localized,
nonplanar deposition resulting in laments22,5.
