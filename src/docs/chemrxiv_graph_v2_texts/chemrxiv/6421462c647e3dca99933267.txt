Description:
Reacts with metallic magnesium to form organomagnesium halides in an anhydrous, etheric solvent.

Text:
Organomagnesium halides, better known as Grignard reagents, 
are formed by the exothermic reaction of metallic magnesium 
(usually turnings or powder) with a halide in an anhydrous, 
etheric solvent. Grignard reagents can be used for the 
formation of new carboncarbon bonds and are one of the most 
important intermediates in such reactions.1 Both on a small 
scale in a glass flask in chemical laboratories, and on a larger 
scale in stirred vessels in the chemical industry, Grignard 
reagents are prepared in a dosingcontrolled semi batch process 
based on placing a certain mass of magnesium together with a 
small amount of the halide in the solvent in the stirred vessel 
and then slowly adding the remaining halidesolvent mixture2.
