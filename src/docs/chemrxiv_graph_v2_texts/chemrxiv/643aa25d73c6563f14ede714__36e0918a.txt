The successful exfoliation of graphene from graphite and the sub
sequent discovery of its unique chemical, physical, and electronic prop
erties have attracted much attention to 2Dlayered materials 19, 20. One of the particularly promising areas of their application is gas sens
ing due to their atomic thinlayered structure and large surfacetovolume
ratio. Although graphene shows excellent gassensing capabilities, its
application in gas sensors is limited by its zeroband gap resulting in
poor switching characteristics 21. However, other 2Dlayered mate
rials, such as transitionmetaldichalcogenide (TMD) sheets, possess
a sizeable band gap and thus are free of this inherent limitation of
graphene 1921.

Similarly to graphene,
TMD sheets interact in bulk crystals via weak van der Waals (vdW)
forces and thus can be effectively exfoliated. Atoms within individual
sheets are covalently bonded and have satisfied valence. This makes
TMD surfaces chemically inert under most conditions, which limits
their surface interactions to physisorption. TMDs such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have been shown
sensing platforms capable of effective detection of nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) 3235 and ammonia (NH3) 3538. However, their sensi
tivity toward other gas molecules (including SO2) was reported low
in comparison. The response of TMD sheets toward selected analytes
can be enhanced via substitutional doping 3948, or decoration of
their surfaces with single atoms 49, nanoparticles50, 51, and nan
otubes 18.
