Description:
Designated as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention in 2009.

Text:
To address this global 
62 
challenge, numerous organizations have taken regulatory measures. For instance, the 
63 
Stockholm Convention designated PFOS, and PFOA as persistent organic pollutants in 2009, 
64 
and 2019, respectively.22,23 The European Commission has outlined its chemicals strategy, 
65 
which includes plans to phase out nonessential uses of PFAS within the EU.24,25 The 
66 
International Chemicals Management has identified PFAS as a priority issue.

Description:
A chemical with a specific maximum contaminant level of 4.0 parts per trillion in drinking water.

Text:
In 2016, the US 
67 
EPA established a drinking water health advisory level of 70 ngL for the combined 
68 
concentrations of PFOA and PFOS.26 The US EPA recently established the firstever national 
69 
drinking water standard for PFAS, which will go into effect with mandatory monitoring by 2027 
70 
and compliance by 2029, with specific maximum contaminant levels for PFOA, and PFOS at 4.0 
71 
parts per trillion.27 As a result of these regulations, researchers worldwide are actively seeking 
72 
effective treatment techniques to remove PFAS from water sources. 73 
The predominant focus of recent research lies in investigating the efficacy of various 
74 
technologies for removing PFAS, encompassing adsorption, membrane filtration, destructive 
75 
processes, and other methodologies.
