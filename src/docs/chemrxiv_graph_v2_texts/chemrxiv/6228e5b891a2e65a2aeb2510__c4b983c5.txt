Description:
Synthesized from methylenecyclopropane and cyanoalkenes catalyzed by a Tinate complex.

Text:
Dibromo ringsubstituted phenylcyanoacrylates (PCA) were reported in a variety of 
applications. Thus, 3,5dibromo ringsubstituted PCA was mentioned in syntheses of (1) 
spiro2.3hexanes from methylenecyclopropane and cyanoalkenes catalyzed by a Tinate 
complex 1; (2) phenylsuccinimide derivatives with anticonvulsant properties 2, 3. 3,4
dichloro ringsubstituted PCA was prepared by Knoevenagel condensation at room 
temperature using SeO2ZrO2 catalyst in watermedium and solventfree conditions 4. It 
was used in a highly efficient protocol for the regio and stereoselective synthesis of spiro 
pyrrolidine and pyrrolizidine derivatives by multicomponent reaction 5 and in 
Knoevenagel condensation involving a PEG bridged tertiary amine functionalized ionic 
liquid that exhibited thermoregulated reversible biphasic behavior with cyclohexane
isopropanol mixtures 6, as well as in synthesis of 5,6dichloroindan1acids and their 
tetrazolyl derivatives as analgesic and antiinflammatory agents 7.
