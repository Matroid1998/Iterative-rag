Description:
Undergo photochemical all-trans to 13-cis double bond isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin.

Text:
In bacteriorhodopsin, photochemical alltrans to 13cis doublebond isomerization of retinals 
protonated Schiff base is at the basis of a proton translocation event.13 Release of protons to 
the extracellular medium and reprotonation from the cytoplasm creates a concentration grad
ient, which serves as energy reservoir to produce ATP. Artificial systems that  to some extent 
 imitate such function46 may provide new perspectives on solar energy conversion, and could 
shed light on fundamental aspects of biological pumps.
