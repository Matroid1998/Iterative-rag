Description:
Materials with high specific surface, pore volumes, and unique pore sizes used in catalysis, adsorption, and drug delivery.

Mesoporous silica materials (MSMs) have gained tremendous success in various applications 
recently, mainly due to their interesting and unique textural and structural features. These features 
include high specific surface, pore volumes, and unique pore sizes, which allow their use in 
processes such as catalysis, adsorption, separation of target molecules, drug delivery devices, 
chemosensors, and biosensors 1,2. They exhibit greater capacity for drugs loading and ensure a 
controlled bioactive compound release if they are functionalized, in comparison with amorphous 
colloidal silica 3. They are usually prepared from the selfassembly of surfactants, such as 
pluronic polymers in solvents, followed by rapid condensation of silica precursors around the 
micelle. The silicate condenses and forms an outer shell around the selfassembly.
