Description:
Plated (reduced) during battery charge and stripped (oxidized) during discharge.

Electroplating metal is the ultimate electrode charge storage process for rechargeable batteries 
with respect to their energy density, cost, processability, and sustainability. Irrespective of 
chemistry (be it based on M Li, Na, Ca, Zn, Al, or Fe, etc. ), metal electrodes operate simply 
by plating (reducing) Mn and stripping (oxidizing) the corresponding metal M during battery 
charge and discharge, respectively. Despite their immense promise, metal electrodes in 
rechargeable batteries still face multiple challenges that need to be more deeply understood and 
overcome before successful practical realization.
