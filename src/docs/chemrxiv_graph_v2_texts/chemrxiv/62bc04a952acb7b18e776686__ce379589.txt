To overcome the challenges of modern SECM, we improved the electrochemical 
imaging by using novel soft probes scanned in contact mode and then established the 
algorithmassisted artificial intelligence (AI) for image fusion.26,27 Firstly, we developed 
new ultrathin gold wire electrodes with extreme flexibility. The probes were made of 
gold wire, and sealed in parafilm and polyimide (PI) membrane. Subsequently, the oral 
cancer biomarkers EGFR protein on the tumor slices were labeled with primary and 
secondary antibodies with horseradish oxidase (HRP). HRP catalyzed the oxidation 
reaction of ferrocenmethanol (FcMeOH) to FcMeOH in the presence of FcMeOH and 
H2O2.
