and Assessment of Reported Route 
Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) is the most frequently mutated 
oncogene and is associated with several highly fatal 
cancers.1 Exceptional recent advances have resulted in drug 
candidates for this target which was once considered 
undruggable. Adagrasib (MRTX849, 1, Figure 1) is a therapy 
for treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer which results 
from G12C point mutation to the KRAS gene.2 The NDA filing 
for this drug candidate is under FDA review with a decision 
to be made in December, 2022. Supporting further clinical 
combination trials and commercial manufacture for sizable 

Figure 1 Adagrasib. patient populations requires ability to consistently produce 
ton scale quantities with a high degree of control. This 
publication communicates those efforts.
