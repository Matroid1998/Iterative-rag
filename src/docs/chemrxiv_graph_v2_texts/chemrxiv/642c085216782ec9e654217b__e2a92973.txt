Description:
Compounds with moderate nucleophilic character used for synthesizing structurally complex molecules.

Text:
Allylboronic esters are an important class of compounds used 
in a variety of transformations. Their moderate nucleophilic 
character offers a high functional group tolerance, making 
them ideal for the synthesis of structurally complex 
molecules.1 Allylboronic esters are also commonly used to 
react with aldehydes, ketones and imines to form the 
corresponding homoallylic derivatives with high levels of 
enantio and diastereocontrol.2 Hence, the development of 
new methods allowing a straightforward, sustainable and 
ideally inexpensive access to these compounds is of great 
importance.

Description:
Simplest form of allylboranes limited by 1,3-metallotropic shifts.

Text:
Several strategies have been reported over the 
years.36 The first one involves the addition of highly reactive 
organometallic species such as Grignard reagents on 
trialkoxyboranes and subsequent addition of a diol,3 however, 
although effective, this approach suffers from an easy 
1,3metallotropic shift of the organometallic species, which 
leads to a mixture of the linear and the branched 
allylboranes, thus limiting this method to the simplest 
allylboronic esters. Since the mid90s and the pioneering 
work of Miyaura4 and Ito5 on the palladium and copper
catalyzed borylation of allylic acetates (Figure 1. A), the 
development of transition metalcatalyzed borylation of 
allylic derivatives has tremendously facilitated the synthesis 
of these compounds.
