Description:
A type I superionic conductor that exhibits a discontinuous superionic transition with a first-order structural phase transition.

Text:
Superionic conductors that exhibit a superionic transi
tion can be classied typeI or typeII according to the na
ture of the transition 1, 7. TypeI superionic conductors,
such as AgI, exhibit a discontinuous superionic transition,
accompanied by a rstorder structural phase transition
at Ts from a poorlyconducting phase to the superionic
phase 1. In contrast, typeII superionic conductors, such
as PbF2, exhibit a continuous superionic transition, ac
companied by a secondorder phase transition associated
with a constantpressure heat capacity peak at Ts 1, 8.
