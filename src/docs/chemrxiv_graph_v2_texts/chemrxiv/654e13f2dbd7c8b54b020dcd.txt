Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released during industrial processes ranging from 
52 
pharmaceutical manufacturing to automotive applications, as well as in domestic settings. They can 
53 
originate as byproducts of combustion, fuel storage, cooking, or through outgassing from household 
54 
furnishings 17. VOCs can also build up in enclosed spaces or areas with poor air exchange, resulting 
55 
in increased local concentration and associated cumulative exposure risk 8,9. Often, these VOCs pose 
56 
a significant health risk at concentrations below human perception, e.g., methanol 8hour worker 
57 
safety threshold (200 ppm) vs. human odor detection (10,000 ppm) 1013.
