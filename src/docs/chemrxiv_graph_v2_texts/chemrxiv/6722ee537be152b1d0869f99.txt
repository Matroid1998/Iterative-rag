Description:
Forms ionically bound diatomic molecules such as oxides, sulfides, halides, and nitrides.

Text:
Gas phase spectroscopic studies of actinidecontaining diatomic molecules have yielded 
information concerning the electronic structure and bonding of several ionically bound examples 
(oxides, sulfides, halides and nitrides of Th and U)125. The value of studying these molecules in 
the gas phase is that the results can be used to evaluate the accuracy of relativistic quantum 
chemistry calculations, without the additional difficulties presented by condensed phase lattice or 
solventsolute interactions. Gasphase highresolution spectroscopic determination of energy 
levels and properties for actinidecontaining diatomic molecules6,15,17,2628 also plays important 
roles in using these molecules as highly sensitive quantum sensors for probing fundamental 
physics beyond the Standard Model.
