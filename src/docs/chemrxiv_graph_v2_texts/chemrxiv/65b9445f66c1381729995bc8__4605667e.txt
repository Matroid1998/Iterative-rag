The quest for clean energy has become increasingly important in todays world, driven by the urgent need 
to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the advancement of energy storage 
technologies and the broader adoption of renewable energy sources is vital for transitioning to a cleaner 
energy future 1, a parallel focus on carbon capture technologies is equally important. Effective carbon 
management is vital for addressing emissions from some of the toughesttoabate sectors, such as heavy 
industries like steel production and cement manufacturing. These industries face challenges in rapidly 
reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. Therefore, parallel efforts to advance carbon capture technologies 
are essential and play a crucial role in mitigating these sectors environmental impact during the transition 
and beyond 2.
