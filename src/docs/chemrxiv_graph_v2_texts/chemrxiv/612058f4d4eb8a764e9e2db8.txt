Description:
Involved in the photooxidation-induced degradation of MAPbI3.

While 
accelerated aging tests like the IEC 61215 standard (which includes testing the drop in performance 
after the panel is held at 85 C and 85 RH for 1,000 hrs)12 have been used to estimate service 
lifetime and provide performance guarantees,7,8 these tests have only been validated for silicon 
and thin film based PV technologies like CdTe.1315 Unlike in Si or CdTe, HPs break down due to 
chemical reactions of the semiconductor with water, oxygen, and photoexcited electrons,6,1620 and 
there exists a strong correlation between decay of optoelectronic properties such as carrier 
diffusion length and material transformation rate.21,22 In oxygen and light, a photooxidation
induced degradation of MAPbI3 has been reported previously19,23,24 and is widely believed to occur 
via a mechanism that involves superoxide radical (2
  ) generated by photoexcited electrons in 
the conduction band of MAPbI3 to yield the overall reaction1820,23,24

Others have disputed the generation of water in this process, citing instead the overall reaction20,25 
(note that PbI2 and I2 are not directly reported in 20 or 25, but necessarily must be formed as stated 
to maintain charge and species conservation through the reaction)

In humid environments, attack by moisture is widely reported to be the primary mode of 
degradation in MAPbI3 thin films,16,17 with a reported degradation pathway of

Despite these proposed overall reactions, quantitative acceleration factors describing how 
increasing oxygen, humidity, or illumination levels impact HP material degradation rate are still 
unknown.
