Formed in the ratio of 241:19.

was the first to reverse the 
trend, forming N2H4NH3 in the ratio of 241 19. Of 
late a remarkable finding was reported by Dey and co
workers wherein they have developed the first 
molecular complex Ni3S82 which reduces N2 to 
N2H4 
as 
the 
only 
nitrogenous 
product 
electrochemically 20. The intermediates involved in the catalytic mechanism 
have not been identified and the underlying 
mechanism 
was 
unclear 
from 
the 
reported 
experimental findings. Furthermore, there are hardly 
any precedents of NRR by Ni. The situation is 
complicated due to competing NRR and HER 
(Hydrogen evolution reaction) at similar reduction 
potentials 21. Hence it presents a wonderful 
opportunity for theoretical comprehension of the 
mechanistic roadmap of this intriguing and unique 
Scheme 1 Reaction studied in this work. 2
