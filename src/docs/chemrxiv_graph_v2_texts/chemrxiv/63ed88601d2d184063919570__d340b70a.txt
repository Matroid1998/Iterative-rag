Description:
A superconductor with confirmed superconductivity at 250 K.

Text:
LaH10 is perhaps the most
recognisable example of this class, predicted and analysed theoretically8 before experiments
confirmed the structure9 and then superconductivity at 250 K.10,11 Other examples include
CaH6,,12,13 zirconium hydrides including ZrH3, Zr4H15, and ZrH6,1417 and various hydrides
of yttrium.8,1820 Some predictions of new hydride superconductors are yet to be realised,21
which has been attributed to shortcomings in DFT methods or the possibility that the su
perhydrides are not conventional phononmediated superconductors described by BCS the
ory.22,23
The workhorse of this field is crystal structure prediction (CSP), an umbrella term for
computational methods for determining the crystal structure of a material without any prior
information.2429 Studies utilizing this method generally identify the most thermodynam
ically stable phases for a chosen AHx system as a function of pressure by running CSP
calculations at various pressures and AH ratios.8 Superconducting critical temperatures
