Description:
Used in NIR probes based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).

Text:
Our research group has focused on the reductive cleavage of azo groups under hypoxia and developed 
NIR probes based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between dicarbocyanines and 
Black Hole Quencher (BHQ).22 Although these probes are selectively activated in severe hypoxia, they 
are not optimal for in cellulo and in vivo applications due to their large molecular size and susceptibility 
to photobleaching. As another strategy, we have recently developed fluorescence probes that detect 
hypoxia by incorporating an azo group into an O rhodamine or Si rhodamine (SiR) scaffold.21,23 For 
example, we have developed greenemitting MAR,23 redemitting MASR23 and NIRemitting 
azoSiR640 (2,6diMe azoSiR640),21 and confirmed that they can detect hypoxia in cultured cells and 
mouse models.
