A fullerene with a unique cage structure offering exceptional quantum efficiency in photocatalysis.

Text:
C60 fullerene knitted in polymeric form, with its unique cage
structure, offers exceptional quantum efficiency in photocatalysis
due to its large surface area, abundant micropores, and superior
electron transport properties also display anisotropy when
networks controlled by covalent bonding connections37,38. Acting as both an electron donor and acceptor, it enhances
carrier separation and energy transfer, improving photocatalytic
performance. When incorporated into composites, C60 reduces
defects, enhances crystallization, and increases stability, further
boosting efficiency. Its potential for hydrogen storage also makes
