Description:
A redox-active molecule used to enhance conductivity.

Text:
of either 
conductive substances such as conjugated PEDOT7 or PPy,8 or 
redoxactive molecules such as tetracyanoquinodimethane 
(TCNQ)9 or ferrocene10 into the MOF pores or external crystal 
surfaces,11 which leads to a substantial overall improvement in 
conductivity. Besides considerations 
of 
conductivity, 
the 
integration of such MOFs into electronic platforms is also 
necessary for their practical utilization12 and significant 
engineering efforts have been invested into optimizing the 
processing of MOFs into appropriate configurations for 
integration.13 Micro and nanofabrication techniques have been 
crucial in the path towards device miniaturization.
