Description:
Used as a central atom in porphyrin complexes with phosphorescence lifetimes in the order of tens of microseconds.

Among 
numerous phosphorescent indicators explored metalloporphyrins are probably the most popular 
representatives.10,11 Palladium(II) and platinum(II) are almost exclusively used as central atoms; their 
porphyrin complexes possess phosphorescence lifetimes in order of tens and hundreds of 
microseconds, respectively. Immobilization of these indicators in polymers with moderate oxygen 
permeability such as polystyrene and its copolymers with acrylonitrile, poly(methyl methacrylate) 
etc. results in sensors operating at ambient conditions. On the other hand, highly gaspermeable 
matrices are required for preparation of sensors for traces of oxygen. These include polymers with 
high free volume such as silicone rubber,12 perfluorinated polymers of Teflon AF13 and Hyflon AD14 
series and poly(1trimethylsilyl1propyne),15 which is the polymer with the highest oxygen 
permeability ever reported.
