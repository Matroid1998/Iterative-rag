A biologically active natural product.

Text:
An understanding of the major circulating metabolites that are generated from a 
parent biologically active molecule is of critical importance in drug discovery campaigns.1 
One powerful and emerging approach to detect and identify drug metabolites is the use of 
electrochemical techniques.215 An alternative approach is to computationally predict via 
docking how a drug might interact with a cytochrome. 1618 However, approaches that 
interlink these two complementary techniques are not delineated at present. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20244lt9w ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000238975626 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0

We have a longstanding interest in the chemistry 19 and molecular interactions 20 
of the biologically active natural product, piperine.

Description:
A potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP4A6 and related familial isoforms.

Text:
Piperine is a potent inhibitor of 
cytochrome CYP4A6 and related familial isoforms 2122 but to the best of our knowledge 
the exact biological mechanism by which piperine is metabolised remains unknown.23 
There is, however, a body of evidence of typical piperine metabolites to enable confirmation 
by comparison. 2427 
Results and Discussion 
Prior to electrochemical reaction the cyclic voltammetry behaviour of piperine was measured 
28 We have previously shown the voltammetric behaviour of a drug molecule is inversely 
correlated to it in situ metabolic halflife.29 Using ferrocene (FcFc) as an internal standard 
for the pseudo AgAgCl wire reference electrode and a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the 
working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode (CE), the cyclic voltammetry 
behaviour of piperine was explored (Figures 1 ac).
