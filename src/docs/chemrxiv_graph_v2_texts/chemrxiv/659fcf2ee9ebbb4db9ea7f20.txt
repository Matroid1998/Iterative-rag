Description:
Materials with amorphous and disordered structures used in nanoporous electrodes.

Text:
One design criterion that has not yet been optimised for layered MOF supercapacitors is the electrolyte 
ion size to electrode pore size ratio. Previous studies have attempted to answer this question for 
nanoporous carbon electrodes, although differences and difficulties in analysing the pore structure of 
carbon materials, which have amorphous and disordered structures, have led to conflicting and 
confusing results.1926 One effect observed in some studies on this topic is porosity saturation of the 
porous carbon electrode.27 This involves the complete filling of the electrolyte accessible surface area 
of the electrode during charging, and occurs when using electrolytes with larger ion sizes and carbons 
with low relative porosities.
