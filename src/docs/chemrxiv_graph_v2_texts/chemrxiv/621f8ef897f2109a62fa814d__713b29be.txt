Description:
Highly reactive building blocks used in the development of stereogenic phosphorus targets.

Nucleophilic substitution at stereogenic P(V) centers can occur 
stereospecifically, thereby providing a powerful strategy for the synthesis of complex, optically 
active compounds from simple P(V) building blocks bearing one or more leaving groups attached 
to phosphorus (9, 1113). Effective methods for accessing stereogenicatphosphorus targets have relied primarily on 
the use of covalently attached chiral auxiliaries to achieve diastereocontrol, and a variety of 
chelating auxiliaries have been developed successfully for this purpose (Fig. 1B) (1422). Their 
applicability depends on the ability to achieve stereospecific displacement of the auxiliary to forge 
P(V) stereocenters with absolute stereocontrol. Among noteworthy recent advances using the 
chiral auxiliary approach, Baran and coworkers reported the development of highly reactive 
oxathiaphospholanesulfide building blocks (21, 22).
