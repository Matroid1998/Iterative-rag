Description:
The simplest 4-alkylated pyrimidine nucleoside involved in phosphorolysis and transglycosylation reactions.

Text:
Herein, we address this gap by 
reporting on the phosphorolysis and transglycosylation of 
the simplest 4alkylated pyrimidine nucleoside, 4
methyluridine (1a). Following the identification of a 
suitable biocatalyst, and a characterization of its reactivity 
with kinetic experiments and docking studies, we explored 
the thermodynamics of the phosphorolysis of 1a and 
leveraged 
this 
information 
in 
transglycosylation 
experiments to access a range of 4methylated pyrimidine 
and purine nucleosides. In the absence of obvious pyrimidine nucleoside 
phosphorylase (PyNP) candidates for the phosphorolysis of 
1a, we began our investigation by screening a small panel 
of PyNPs with known broad substrate spectra. To our 
surprise, only the PyNP from Thermus thermophilus 
(TtPyNP)26,27 showed measurable conversion of 1a under 
screening conditions (Figure S1).
