In order to implement renewable energy sources into the energy infrastructure, their inherent fluctuating 
21 
availability must be compensated for. One way of doing this is to convert surplus electrical energy into 
22 
easy storable chemical energy, also known as the powertox (PtX) concept 1. In this process, hydrogen 
23 
(H2) is obtained from the renewable electrical energy using electrolysis in a first step. Since H2 is difficult 
24 
to be stored in the long term and suitable infrastructure is not yet available, it is advantageous to further 
25 
convert it into methane (CH4), which can be stored, distributed and used in the existing natural gas grid.
