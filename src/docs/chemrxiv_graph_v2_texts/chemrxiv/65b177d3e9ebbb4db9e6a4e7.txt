Description:
An oxyanion that can be probed using electronic or vibrational spectroscopic techniques.

Text:
The 
latter two techniques circumvent the strong absorber problem of water in the ultraviolet and mid
infrared regions, which prevents the probing of most inorganic ions at surfaces using conventional 
electronic or vibrational spectroscopic techniques (notable exceptions are oxyanions like 
arsenate,1012 chromate,13 phosphate,14 or sulfate.
