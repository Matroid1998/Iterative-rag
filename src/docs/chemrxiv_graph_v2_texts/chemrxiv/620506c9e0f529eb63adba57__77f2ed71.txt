Description:
A variant of the parent molecule with chlorine atoms replaced by fluorine.

Text:
A large class of aryl piperazine 
derivatives of 1,7,8,9Tetrachloro10,10dimethoxy4azatricyclo 5.2.1.02,6 dec8ene3,5
dione were evaluated in vitro against agents of different virus classes, such as the singlestranded 
RNA viruses, Yellow Fever virus and Bovine viral diarrhoea virus, both belonging to the 
Flaviviridae, a HIV1 (Retrovirus), and HBV (Hepadnavirus) 16. Complexes of 
diarylpiperidin4one were found as the new variety of antimicrobial agents with activity against 
pathogenic bacterial species and fungal strains 17. In order to analyse the effect of halogen 
substitution, in the parent molecule, the position of four chlorine atoms are replaced by bromine, 
and fluorine atoms respectively and which are designated as TCDBPAD, TCDBPAD Br and 
TCDBPAD F. The title compound was spectroscopically characterized by employing FTIR and 
FTRaman studies.
