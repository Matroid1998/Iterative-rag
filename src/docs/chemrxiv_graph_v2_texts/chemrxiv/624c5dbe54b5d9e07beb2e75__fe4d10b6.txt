Description:
Singlet carbenes are main group molecules with analogous chemical properties to transition metals.

Text:
Last two decades have witnessed an increasing interest in 
activation of small molecules to convert them into valueadded 
chemicals and fuels.1 Main group molecules2 consisting of 
analogous chemical properties of transition metals, like singlet 
carbenes,3 heavier group 14 dimetallynes or dimetallenes,4 
frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP)5 have shown potential to activate the 
CH, NH, BH, OH, HH bonds in small molecules.
