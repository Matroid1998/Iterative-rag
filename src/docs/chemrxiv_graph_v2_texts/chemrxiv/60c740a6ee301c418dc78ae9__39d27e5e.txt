Description:
An anticancer immunomodulatory drug that induces proteasome-dependent degradation of cancer-driving proteins.

Text:
Clinical validation of small molecules inducing 
protein degradation is provided by recent discoveries on the molecular mechanism of 
thalidomide and related clinical anticancer immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as 
lenalidomide and pomalidomide, which induce the proteasomaldependent degradation of 
cancerdriving proteins.36,37 More recently, a PROTAC compound (ARV110) that targets the 
androgen receptor for degradation has been announced as a clinical candidate.38
