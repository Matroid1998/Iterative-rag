Description:
A photocatalyst used in the degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UVA irradiation.

Text:
Photocatalysis is a capable and promising technology for the 
treatment of persistent or refractory substances present in wastewaters 2 and in this context, the 
design of multifunctional photocatalysts capable of simultaneous degradation as well as 
disinfection is very much required. In this work, three ternary doped Titanium Dioxide 
photocatalysts with boron cerium and silver as the dopants have been synthesized using the facile 
and ecofriendly EDTA citrate method 3. These synthesized catalysts have been evaluated in the 
degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UVA irradiation. The characterization of these 
catalysts has also been performed using a variety of tools such as SEM, DRS, BET Surface area 
etc.

Description:
A photocatalyst whose performance is enhanced by ternary doping.

Text:
The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a scalable and efficient solution for 
one of the most pressing environmental and public health challenges. By employing a ternary 
doping strategy, the photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic performance compared 
to undoped titanium dioxide. The introduction of boron, cerium, and silver synergistically
