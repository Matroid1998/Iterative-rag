Description:
A benchmark system used in nucleation process studies.

Text:
Typically, a recent study has captured images of the
nucleation processes of the benchmark NaCl system.3 Sim
ilar experiments for the MetalOrganic Frameworks (MOFs)
are extremely challenging due to the diversity of the pool
of organic and metalbased species from which selfassembly
occurs, and the many types of coordinative bonds and poly
morphic structures.
