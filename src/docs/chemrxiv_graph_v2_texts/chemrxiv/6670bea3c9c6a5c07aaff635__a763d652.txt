Description:
A type of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) whose viscosity is investigated when generated using OH or O3 as oxidants.

Text:
In addition, two 
studies investigated the viscosity of phenolic SOA generated using OH or O3 as the oxidants. 65,66 
In contrast, much less is known on the viscosity of SOA, either phenolic or other types, formed 
with NO3. Kasparoglu et al. suggested that SOA generated from the oxidation of pinene by NO3 was 
viscous or hydrophobic or both, based on ice nucleation measurements.64 In addition, experiments
