Description:
The simplest of the unsaturated acids.

The poor management of this WAP stream may lead to unfavorable 
environmental outcomes such as uncontrolled GHG emissions from the disposal of pomace in landfills, 
unwanted acidification of agricultural soils via leachate formation and also the pollution of under
ground waters 6. The utilization of WAP as a biomass resource therefore presents an opportunity for 
value extraction while also circumventing waste management concerns7. The current study therefore 
seeks to investigate the production of AA from WAP. Acrylic acid (AA; CHCHCOOH) is the simplest 
of the unsaturated acids 810. AA is an important product that is characterized by several significant 
end uses such as supper absorbent polymers, artificial leather and textiles (Figure 1).
