Description:
Increases capacity in active materials but makes them more prone to aging.

Text:
As the nickel content in the active material
increases, so does the capacity, but this also makes the material significantly more prone
to aging.3 Common aging mechanisms for Nirich cathode active materials (CAM) include
gassing and cracking, both of which heavily impact battery safety and capacity.4,5 Among
these, oxygen release is particularly concerning as it is the primary driver for safety haz
ards such as thermal runaway.6 Oxygen release typically occurs at high voltages, which are
applied at the end of charge.7 The interface between different phases in cathode materials
also plays a critical role in determining their performance and longevity.
