Description:
An atom that, when substituted for oxygen in nucleobases, increases reactivity upon photoexcitation by enhancing relaxation to the triplet manifold.

The photophysics of natural nucleobases have been studied extensively owing to their 
biological significance and the role that fast nonadiabatic relaxation plays in their high 
photostability.18 In contrast, single atom substitutions, such as the replacement of one or both 
nucleobase oxygens with sulfur atoms, have been shown to have profound impacts on relaxation 
pathways following photoexcitation.917 These nucleobase derivatives are of interest owing to their 
potential for pharmacological applications such as phototherapy where they can act as 
photosensitizers.911, 18, 19 For example, upon photoexcitation of sulfur substituted nucleobases, the 
quantum yield for relaxation to the triplet manifold nears unity, resulting in increased reactivity 
compared to canonical nucleobases that undergo rapid relaxation to their ground electronic states.7, 
9, 11, 14, 17 It is also of interest to contrast the interactions of natural and thiosubstituted nucleobases 
with low energy electrons, since this interaction is also important in radiation chemistry and 
biology.
