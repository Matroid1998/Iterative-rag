of Na, K, or Cs cations also decreased the adsorption capacity (fig. S14 and table 
S4) (26). The Li2SAPORHO sample exhibited remarkable stability. Its crystallinity remained after 
exposure to 75 humidity at ambient temperature or under hydrothermal conditions at 373 K for 
7 days (fig. S15). This exceptional hydrothermal stability highlights its potential for realworld
