Description:
Converted to NH3 in the presence of UV-Vis light without using any sacrificial reagent.

Text:
demonstrated that 
AuRu core antenna nanostructures are indeed capable of 
producing NH3 from dinitrogen molecule in the presence of UV
Vis light at a significant rate at room temperature and ambient 
pressure and, most importantly without using any sacrificial 
reagent.14 Incidentally over the past decade it has been shown 
that Au nanoparticles can unleash a plethora of chemical 
phenomena including catalytic transformations ranging from H2 
bond dissociation, water splitting and CO2 reduction when 
irradiated with UVVis irradiation by generation of hot 
electrons.1519
