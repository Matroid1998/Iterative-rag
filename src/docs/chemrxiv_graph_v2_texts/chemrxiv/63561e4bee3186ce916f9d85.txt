Description:
Monomers known for trends in propagation rate coefficient (kp) with ester side chain length.

Text:
Yet, no unifying 
approach exists to date that correlates the structure of a 
monomer with its rate of propagation, and therefore no 
meaningful prediction of kinetic data can be made. Within 
specific 
families 
of 
monomers, 
most 
notably 
the 
(meth)acrylates, some trends are known.5 For example, the  
on first glance counterintuitive  increase of the propagation 
rate coefficient (kp) with the length of the ester side chain. Yet, 
already smaller differences in structure such as branching vs 
linear ester chains are not captured in the literature.6 The 
traditional way to predict kp is to use high level abinitio 
quantum chemical calculation.7 While by themselves highly 
interesting, these calculations have for some monomers 
confirmed experimental values, but they struggle to make 
absolute predictions.
