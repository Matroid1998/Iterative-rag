Description:
A JAK1-JAK3 inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Text:
Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors are novel targeted synthetic diseasemodifying 
antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs). The new class of small molecule drugs represents an 
important alternative to treat moderatetosevere rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with 
non or inadequateresponse to conventional synthetic diseasemodifying antirheumatic 
drugs (csDMARDs) and biological diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). (1) 
The JAK inhibitors target one or more kinases of the JAK family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and 
nonreceptor tyrosineprotein kinase TYK2) and inhibit multiple proinflammatory 
cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)6, IL10, and interferon (IFN)g.(2,3) Baricitinib 
(JAK1JAK2 inhibitor) and tofacitinib (JAK1JAK3 inhibitor) are the first members of this 
class approved in the United States (US) and Europe to treat RA (Figure 1). Figure 1.

Chemical structure of baricitinib and tofacitinib, the first JAK inhibitors approved 
in the USA and Europe to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Safety concerns associated with JAK inhibitors, such as the increased risk for thrombosis 
and viral infection or reactivation have emerged worldwide and boxed warnings are 
included on all approved JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. (47) 
While a doseresponse effect was observed in the risk of thrombosis in clinical trials of 
both baricitinib and tofacitinib, there is no clear mechanism associated to the
