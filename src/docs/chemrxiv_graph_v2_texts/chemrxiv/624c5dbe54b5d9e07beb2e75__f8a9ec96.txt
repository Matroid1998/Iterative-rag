Description:
Involved in the activation of NH bonds by nonmetal boron-containing systems.

Text:
However, in 
recent times, small molecule activation by boronbased systems 
have emerged as an area of considerable attention as the boron 
systems are more available and most importantly those mitigate 
the deleterious properties of transition metalbased systems.6 In 
2016, Martin and coworkers reported the activation of BH bond 
of pinacolborane and NH bond of aniline by nonmetal boron 
containing pentaphenylborole moiety.7 These crucial insights 
have allowed us for the development of metal free boron based 
catalyst to activate the BH and NH bonds in ammoniaborane 
(H3NBH3, AB) molecule.
