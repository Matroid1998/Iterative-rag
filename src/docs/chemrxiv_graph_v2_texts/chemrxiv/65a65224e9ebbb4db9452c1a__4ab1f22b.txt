Description:
A transition metal atom used in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).

Further investigation and optimization of
TMDbased gas sensing mechanisms hold the key to advancing this
technology and addressing the pressing need for more robust and effi
cient NOx monitoring strategies. In particular, the impact of comprising
elements on the sensitivity of TMDs remains still elusive. TMDs have a chemical formula of MX2, with M a transitionmetal
atom (Mo, W, etc.) and X a chalcogen atom (S, Se, or Te). TMDs
reported sensitive to NOx, including molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),
molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), and tungsten disulfide (WS2), favor
trigonalparticle geometry with transitionmetal atoms sandwiched be
tween two layers of chalcogen. This makes sheets semiconducting 32,
with most readily available donors of electrons on their surface being pz
orbitals of the chalcogens 18, 19.
