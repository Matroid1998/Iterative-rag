Description:
A macrocyclic hydrocarbon that exhibits global electronic delocalization upon reduction.

Text:
Reduction of conjugated hydrocarbons with alkali metals can 
profoundly alter their electronic structures and properties.1 
24Paracyclophanetetraene 1 (PCT, Fig. 1) is one of the first 
macrocyclic hydrocarbons reported to exhibit global electronic 
delocalization upon reduction.2,3 The electronic structure of the 
neutral form is described by four localized benzene Clar sextets, 
separated by cisvinylene bridges with purely olefinic character. Adding two or four electrons generates a delocalization 
pathway leading to global aromaticity (dianion 26 e) or anti
aromaticity (tetraanion 28 e), manifested by large chemical 
shift differences between the inner and outer core protons in 
the 1H NMR spectra (Ha and Hb, Fig.
