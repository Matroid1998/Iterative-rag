Description:
Classified as a Dirac half metal with linear dispersion in one spin channel.

Due to the delocalisation, a cer
tain assignment of the charge states of the building blocks in
V2(Cl2dhbq)3 was not possible and remains an open ques
tion. Band transport analysis from density functional the
ory (DFT) calculations on single layers of the MOFs indi
cated linear dispersion in both spin channels for V2(Cl2dhbq)3
and in one spin channel for Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, classifying those
MOFs as Dirac metals and Dirac half metals, respectively. 31
While it is known experimentally that counterions can
have a significant effect on the framework structures 32, the
mechanism is largely unexplored. No theoretical study of
the stabilisation via counterions and their effect on the re
dox state of the MOF building blocks has been reported to
our knowledge.
