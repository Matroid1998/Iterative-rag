Description:
Compounds whose MHAT regioselectivity can be adjusted by allylic substituents.

of two different functional groups was achieved in onepot, and the respective degree of 
functionalization approximately matched the feed ratio (P2CNCl). To conclude, we have developed a simple modified protocol of the Carreiratype CoSalencatalyzed 
hydrofunctionalization and Mukaiyama hydration reactions. The key was the inhibition of Salen backbone 
degradation by molecular sieves. This allowed for the highly efficient conversion of challenging, unactivated 1,2
dialkyl olefins at a low catalyst loading, with 0.05 mol being sufficient in most cases. The MHAT regioselectivity 
of this type of alkenes was found to be adjustable by the allylic substituents in both directions (from 6.51 to  
120), implying that radical philicity and hyperconjugation are two important controlling factors. Interesting 
elimination pathways associated with HAT were also identified.
