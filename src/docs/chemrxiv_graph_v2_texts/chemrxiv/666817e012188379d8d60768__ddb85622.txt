Description:
A transition metal used as a catalyst in enantioselective cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
In contrast, the twocomponent enantioselective crosscoupling of sp3hybridized electrophiles with various arylation reagents, 
which is catalyzed by transition metals such as nickel, cobalt, and iron, has emerged as a powerful alternative, particularly for the 
construction of challenging C(sp3)C(sp2) bonds.

Description:
Used in asymmetric catalysis for enantioselective reductive cross coupling processes.

Text:
Moreover, Doyle10a and Mei10b have successfully merged 
asymmetric nickel catalysis with photoredox catalysis or paired electrolysis to provide milder enantioselective reductive cross
coupling processes for the arylation of styrene oxides and chloroesters. It has been accepted that many of these Nicatalyzed 
crosscoupling processes of alkyl halides involve oxidative addition via a radical mechanism.
