Description:
Well-studied intermediates compared to aziridinium ylides.

Text:
Their fourmembered azetidine counterparts have also shown promise in medicinal 
chemistry, but strategies for their preparation have been significantly underexplored compared to 
5 and 6membered Nheterocycles.5,6 Given the overall importance of Nheterocycles in bioactive 
molecules, modular methods to rapidly generate diverse libraries of these compounds with high 
diastereo and enantiopurity from readily available precursors are highly sought.1,712 
 Onium ylides are reactive intermediates that contain a negatively charged carbon atom located 
adjacent to a positively charged heteroatom.13 Aziridinium ylides comprise a subset of onium 
ylides which, in contrast to wellstudied ammonium ylides, have been underexplored in terms of 
their utility for the synthesis of complex heterocycles.14 The reasons for this lack of utility range 
from unwanted cheletropic extrusion of the ylide nitrogen to regenerate the original alkene,15,16 
decomposition pathways17 or the existence of aziridine invertomers that complicate reaction 
outcomes.18 However, we were able to successfully achieve ring expansion of simple aziridines19
30,3133 to complex Nheterocycles via aziridinium ylide intermediates using four key design 
features 1) steric accessibility of the nitrogen lone pair, 2) the presence of an sp3 nitrogen that 
does not bind irreversibly to the catalyst, 3) the ability to form only one ylide stereoisomer, and 4) 
restricted pyramidal inversion by employing a bicyclic aziridine.34 Application of these design
