Compounds used in reductive amination to synthesize amines.

24) remain rare.7 Conventional two
component methods for their synthesis include transition metalcatalyzed CN crosscoupling 
reaction 7, reductive amination of aldehydes or ketones8, Nalkylation of amines9, and imine 
addition10,11 (Figure 1B). While these methods offer access to simple alkyl amines, they pose 
challenges in rapidly synthesizing more complex aliphatic amines and constructing amine libraries 
for structure activity relationship (SAR) studies12. In recent decades, the versatility of imines has 
led to a significant progress in the development of multicomponent reactions as flexible routes to 
amine synthesis13, 14, such as azaMoritaBaylisHillman15, Mannich16, Petasis boronMannich 
(PBM)17 and Strecker18 reacion.
