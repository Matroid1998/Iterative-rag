Description:
A metal halide characterized by an extreme oxidation state.

The
presence of these open questions contrasts with the true metal
halides where nearly every feasible composition has been struc
turally characterized, from extreme oxidation states (e.g. VCl5)10
to highly radioactive compounds (e.g. EsCl3).11 Pseudohalides
thus offer synthetic inorganic chemists the rare opportunity to
create new (pseudo)binary compounds (Fig. 1). In this review, I describe what is known about the solidstate
chemistry of inorganic metal thiocyanates. It presents a system
atic overview of their structures and highlights opportunities for
developing their chemistry further. The very extensive chemistry

 As is standard, where thiocyanate is bonded purely through N it has been written as
M(NCS)x, and when through S as M(SCN)x.
