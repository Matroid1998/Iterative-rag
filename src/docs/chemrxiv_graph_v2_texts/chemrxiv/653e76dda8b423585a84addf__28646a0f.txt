Conversely, with P  2.19, (BP)  0.15, and BP is considered as a covalent semiconductor (cf. 7). As for Al belonging to the 2nd period, Al  1.50, and for AlP (AlP)  0.69, i.e. more than 
four times larger than in the case of BP. Recently, we found a significant densification (with increased hardness) for BN and SiC when 
adopting a quartzderived structure, i.e., qtz topology 8. The aim of the present work is to extend 
the model approach to equiatomic monophosphides of IIIAgroup elements and to consider the 
possibility of their phase transitions at high pressure into superdense quartzbased hexagonal 
phases. Such highpressure structures have been identified for zinc chalcogenides in addition to the 
cubic zincblende polymorphs adopted by the other IIVI compounds 9.
