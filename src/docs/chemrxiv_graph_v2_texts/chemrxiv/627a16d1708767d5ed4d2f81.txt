Description:
An element or compound that forms part of the inorganic layers in metal halide perovskites.

In the last years there has been a growing interest around layered or twodimensional 
(2D) metal halide perovskite (MHPs) for their superior stability and rich structural diversity, 
which may found application in several devices spanning from photovoltaics to lasing.1,2 The 
most investigated families of 2D perovskites are the RuddlesdenPopper (RP) and Dion
Jacobson (DJ) phases of general formula A2An1MnX3n1 and AAn1MnX3n1, respectively, 
where A and A are organic cations, and n represents the number of staggered inorganic layers 
made of metal M and halide X.3 Most of the investigated organic spacers for 2D perovskites, to 
date, are monoammonium cations, while diammonium cations have been less explored.3 In the 
latter case, and in particular for short cations, the DJ phases are generally formed, where the 
inorganic layers are stacked in an eclipsed fashion on top of each other, differently from RP 
where they are staggered.3 In addition, not always a diammonium cation stabilizes a 2D 
perovskite, and 1D structures, characterized by linear chains of octahedra, have been also often 
observed.
