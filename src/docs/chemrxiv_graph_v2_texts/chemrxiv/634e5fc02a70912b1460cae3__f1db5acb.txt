Description:
A product with high selectivity in modified heterogeneous catalysts.

calls Molecularadditivemodied heterogeneous catalysts23), whether by a polymer
coating or by an organic additive, which we will here refer to as functionalized surfaces or molec
ular modiers.2334 This is inspired by the transitionmetal complexes in homogeneous molecular
catalysis, where the properties of the catalyst can be tuned by incorporating functional groups into
the second coordination sphere, changing the electronic and steric environment.23,3542 Several of
these studies, using various coatings on Cu, have reported high ethylene andor ethanol selectivity,
along with high partial current densities for formation of these products.2628,4347 Many theories
abound as to what the effect each specic molecular modier has on the CO2RR is. Suggestions
