Description:
Exhibits a high triplet quantum yield and significantly higher photocytotoxicity compared to 5ALA.

Text:
Like 5ALA, it can pass the disturbed blood
brain barrier and additionally exhibits a high triplet quantum yield that allows for an effective ROS 
formation (23, 24). A direct comparison between hypericin and 5ALA revealed a significantly higher 
photocytotoxicity of hypericin (22). Hypericin was shown to accumulate in the perinuclear region in 
various tumor cell lines with main enrichment sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi 
apparatus, mitochondria and lysosomes (2527). This accumulation behavior has a major influence on 
PDT progression and might affect the actual cell death mechanism. Hypericin uptake and distribution 
was further studied in tumor spheroid models (28) followed by hypericin PDT (29). To understand hypericin PDT, the mechanistical steps of the damaging and dying process need to be 
revealed.

Description:
Tested in photodynamic therapy (PDT) on umbilical vein endothelial, HepG2, and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, where it induced apoptosis.

Text:
Necrosis, however, is induced via caspasesindependent pathways 
and shows a partly different morphological outcome, entailing bleb formation, cellular swelling, 
chromatin condensation and cellular lysis (34, 35). Further cell death mechanisms are ferroptosis or 
paraptosis as well as several hybrid forms, which are all either morphologically or genetically 
distinguishable from one another (36, 37). So far, hypericin PDT was tested on umbilical vein 
endothelial, HepG2 and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, where apoptosis was observed to be
