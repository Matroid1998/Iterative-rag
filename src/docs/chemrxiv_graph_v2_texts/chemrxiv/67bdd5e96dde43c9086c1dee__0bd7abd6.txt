Description:
Has three unpaired electrons (t2g3 (Oh)) and functions as a cyanide-donor ligand.

Text:
Highspin hexacyanometallates of the formula M(CN)63 (MFe, Cr) 
have been used in the past because of their paramagnetic ground state.14 For example, in Cr(CN)63, Cr(III) 
has three unpaired electrons (t2g3 (Oh)) to function as a cyanidedonor ligand to form heterometallic higher
dimensional molecular systems that show high TC molecular magnetism property with long range magnetic 
ordering.15 On the other side, Mn(II) (t2g3 eg2 (Oh)) in highspin state having five unpaired electrons enables
