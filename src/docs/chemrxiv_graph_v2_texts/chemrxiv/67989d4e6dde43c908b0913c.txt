Description:
A less electronegative metal that transfers electrons to thallium in NaTl.

Text:
In 1932, E. Zintl reported on the binary phase NaTl as the first example of a compound with 
formally negatively charged thallium, the socalled thallides.1, 2 The formal electron transfer from 
the less electronegative metal sodium to the more electronegative thallium results in a diamond
like thallium substructure, which was interpreted in terms of the pseudoelement approach, 
introduced by W. Klemm.1, 3 While located left to the socalled Zintl border between group 13 and 
group 14, introduced by F. Laves, textbook known NaTl is still referred to as the first Zintl phase 
and therefore set a milestone for the chemistry of Zintl compounds in general.4 NaTl can be 
prepared using classical hightemperature solidstate synthesis.

Description:
A reducing agent used in the preparation of NaTl.

At the same time, a stoichiometry 
range is given in the related binary phase diagram.5, 6 In addition, E. Zintl himself also prepared 
NaTl in a lowtemperature solution route by reducing thallium(I) iodide by sodium in liquid
