Description:
Used in derivatives for catalytic systems.

Text:
Common catalytic systems include those 
based around boronic acids,2 boric acid derivatives3 or boron heterocycles,4 as well as salts of the group(IV) 
metals titanium, zirconium or hafnium.5 However, to date these catalytic amidation methods have failed to 
become widely adopted.6 This is partly due to the fact that they cannot often be applied to common amide 
targets which incorporate polar functional groups such as heterocyclic rings.

Description:
Catalyzes direct amidation reactions on an industrial scale.

Text:
For larger scale reactions, DeanStark water removal is employed as this is considerably more 
efficient in terms of solvent usage and scalability, and there are a few reports of direct amidation reactions 
catalysed by boric acid or simple boronic acids being employed on an industrial scale.7 The solvents used for 
catalytic amidation reactions are typically aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene,2a,3a fluorobenzene2b), chlorinated 
solvents (1,2dichloroethane2i) or ethers (Et2O,5d THF,4a4b CPME,3e TAME3g3h), and these are often sub
optimal from a safety andor sustainability perspective.8 In addition, these relatively nonpolar solvents do 
not effectively solubilise many polar functionalised carboxylic acids or amines.
