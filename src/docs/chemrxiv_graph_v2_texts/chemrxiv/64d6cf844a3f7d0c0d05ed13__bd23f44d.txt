Description:
Used as primary ions in secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for collisional sputtering.

Although 
work has been done to compare GUV formation methods in 
terms of their resulting unilamellarity, capacitance, shear 
viscosity and number of defects visible by fluorescence 
microscopy31,32, compositional variability has yet to be directly 
examined. Quantifying this variability is critical as lipid 
composition is the primary variable in all GUVbased 
measurements. Here, we examine the compositional variability 
between individual GUVs using stable isotope labeling and 
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). SIMS can be used to measure isotopic ratios present in a 
sample with high precision33,34. The Cameca NanoSIMS 50L 
functions by collisional sputtering of a freezedried bilayer 
containing isotopically labeled lipids with primary cesium ions 
(Cs).
