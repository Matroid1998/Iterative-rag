Description:
A source of energy whose sustainability depends on a low carbon footprint.

Text:
Additionally, fuel cell 
electrical vehicles (FCEV) can be considered an alternative, as they do not cause any direct 
carbon emission during the oxidation cycle that produces electricity. This latter technology is 
of particular interest for heavy duty vehicles 3. Several studies discussed in literature the 
environmental impact of BEV; most of them concluded that these vehicles originate lower 
GHG emissions over their entire lifecycle than equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles 
49. However, this assumption is only valid if the source of electricity or H2 is accompanied 
by a low carbon footprint 10. As the main sources of renewable energy are affected by intrinsic stochastic availability, 
the sustainability of electrified mobility hangs substantially on the energy supply.
