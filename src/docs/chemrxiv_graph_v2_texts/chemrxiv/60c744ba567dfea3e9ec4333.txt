Description:
A crystal with the shortest Cl-Cl distance of 3.65 Ã…, which exceeds the sum of van der Waals radii according to Bondi.

However, it has been noted4,5 that the sum 
of RvdW for available vdW sets including the most widely used one 
tabulated by Bondi6 consistently underestimate the position of 
the energy minimum by as much as 0.30.4 . An illustrative 
example is the C2Cl6 crystal with the shortest r(ClCl)  3.65  
that exceeds significantly the 2RvdWBondi (Cl)  3.50 . The latter 
can only be achieved at a very high pressure of ca. 1.2 GPa.7 
Moreover, about 2.0  (4 000) of unique organic molecular 
crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)8 do not 
contain intermolecular contacts shorter than sum of RvdWBondi (see 
the first section of SI for the details).
