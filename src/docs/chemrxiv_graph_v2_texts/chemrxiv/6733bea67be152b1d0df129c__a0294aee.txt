Description:
Characterized by a sodalite (SOD) topology, used in gas adsorption, separation, storage, and heterogeneous catalysis.

Zeoliticimidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) constitute a novel category of microporous materials, 
demonstrating significant crystallinity within the broader class of metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) 1. For 
example, ZIF8, characterized by a sodalite (SOD) topology, has attracted widespread attention due to its 
welldefined structure and versatile applications in areas such as gas adsorption, separation, storage, and 
heterogeneous catalysis 2,3. With a framework formula of Zn(mim)2 (mim  2methyl imidazolate) and an 
I43m space group, ZIF8 is a typical case of a microporous material with pores of comparably small size 
(around 1 nm) and a size of the pores opening aperture of around 3.4  4.
