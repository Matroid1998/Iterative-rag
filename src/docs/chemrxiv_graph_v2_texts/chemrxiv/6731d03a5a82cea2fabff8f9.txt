Description:
A small substituent accepted by the enzyme.

Text:
The enzyme has been used for the asymmetric synthesis of nonsteroidal profen antiinflammatory 
drugs such as (S)flurbiprofen and (S)naproxen, aheterocyclic propionic acids, and aalkenylcarboxylic 
acids that are building blocks for natural products and pesticides.3 The substrate scope of the enzyme 
is on the one hand very wide in respect of the larger substituent, with the main requirement that it should 
bear a pelectron system. In contrast, the size of the smaller substituent is limited; H, CH3, Cl, Br, OH, 
and NH2 groups are accepted, but 2aryl2ethyl malonates are not converted.2c Another challenge for 
the application of AMDase lies in the spontaneous decarboxylation of aarylmalonate substrates during 
their synthesis from the corresponding dialkyl esters.
