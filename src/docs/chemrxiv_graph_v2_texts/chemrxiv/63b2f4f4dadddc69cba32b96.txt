Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to climate change and ocean acidification.

Text:
CO2 emissions increase drastically due to the fastgrowing global fossilbased energy demand, 
leading to urgent environmental crises such as climate change and ocean acidification. To 
mitigate CO2 emissions, technologies related to the capture and reuse of CO2 from the 
atmosphere or point sources are moving to the fore. Figure 1 The Tandem Electrolyzer concept coupling a CO2 to CO electrolyzer (cell 1) directly to a CO to 
C2 electrolyzer (cell 2) to close the CO2 cycle using valueadded C1C3 products. Efficient CO2 use is 
enabled by a Tandem Electrolysis Cell concept powered by renewables to produce chemicals and fuels. The 
Tandem Cell concept offers maximal materials and operational flexibility for Cell 1 and Cell 2.

Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical reduction reactions to convert it into valorized products.

Text:
In cell 1, the 
captured CO2 will be converted to high purity COrich feeds that enter cell 2 for the electrochemical CC coupling. State of art design suffer from low molar CO concentrations in the exit feed. Relevant performance indicators 
emphasized in the red hexagonal scheme are the partial CO current densities (JCO), Faradaic CO efficiency (FE), 
Cell potential (E), energy efficiency (EE), stoichiometric excess of CO2 () and single pass CO2toCO conversion 
(SP) (Supplementary Table 1). Direct electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a process route to convert CO2 into 
valorized products via multiple electrontransfer reaction steps, with renewable electricity as 
the driving force.111 Catalyzing multielectron reaction cascades at one and the same electrode, 
catalyst, or even molecular active site results in compromised, usually suboptimal overall 
reactivities.
