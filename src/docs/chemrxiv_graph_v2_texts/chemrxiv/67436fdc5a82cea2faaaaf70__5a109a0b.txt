Description:
The most utilized and thoroughly investigated cathode active material in Li-ion and solid-state batteries.

Liion batteries pose an integral part of todays energy economics but are expected to 
run into limitations of achievable energy density in the future, motivating the 
investigation of different technologies, e.g., solidstate batteries.1,2 In both, 
conventional Liion and solidstate batteries, the layered oxides LiNi1xMnyCo1xyO2 
(NCM) are the most utilized and thoroughly investigated cathode active material.3 
Nonetheless, among other things, the relative scarcity of Co and Mn, and resulting 
material costs make the search for alternatives a promising endeavour.46 The cathode 
active material Li2FeS2 offers a costeffective alternative given the large abundance of 
both iron and sulfur,4 comparable to the promised benefits of other alternative 
chemistries such as LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiS.7,8 At the same time, moving from NCM 
to Li2FeS2 means higher mechanical compatibility, and moving from high to low
potential electrodes promises better alignment with the stability window of the stateof
theart sulfurbased solidelectrolytes.9 
In addition to these benefits, Li2FeS2 on paper offers a two electron reaction following 
full delithiation from Li2FeS2 to FeS2.
