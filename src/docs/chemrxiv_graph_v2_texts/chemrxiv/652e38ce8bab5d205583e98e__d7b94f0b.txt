The modern pharmaceutical industry is increasingly focused on sustainable production 
processes and innovative technologies that minimize environmental impacts1 and comply 
with green chemistry principles.2 Mechanochemistry,36 an essentially solventfree 
technique, has shown great potential as a powerful tool for advancing the sustainability 
goals in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).711 By eliminating 
solvents from the production chain, mechanochemistry can offer improved safety profiles 
and minimize the amount of generated waste,12 as solvents can account for up to 90 of 
the total mass consumed and are major contributors to the overall toxicity profile in a 
typical industrial process.13 
Nitrogencontaining functional groups predominate in bioactive molecules14 and carbon
nitrogen (CN) bondforming reactions are widely used in the synthesis of APIs.
