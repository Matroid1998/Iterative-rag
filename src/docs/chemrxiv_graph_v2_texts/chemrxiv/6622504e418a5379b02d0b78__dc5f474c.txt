Description:
Involved in the transfer reaction catalyzed by the MCR enzyme.

Text:
The contribution of the transmembrane domain 
to MCR activity is also incompletely understood, although it is reasonable to assume involvement in 
binding both (lipdated) donor and acceptor substrates, and potentially in orienting these for PEtN 
transfer. Given that the majority of studies have investigated the isolated MCR catalytic domain, it is 
also an open question as to whether residues from the transmembrane domain, in particular Glu116 
positioned on a short helix that sits on the inner membrane surface, form part of the active site in 
the intact protein and hence are important in catalyzing the PEtN transfer reaction. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202481s4k ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000246020571 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
