Description:
An expression of cubic diamond used as a building block for novel carbon allotropes.

1a) proposed in space group I4m2 as seed to build larger carbon networks and 
to serve as a template for other original chemical compounds 7. Note that by considering the 
primitive cell (2 atoms), tetC4 is another expression of cubic diamond whose presentation as tetC4 
is shown here as a starting building block to propose a novel carbon allotrope. In Table 1 showing 
the crystal structure parameters of tetC4, the change of twofold carbon (2b) by fourfold position 
leading to the separation of the C4 tetrahedra along vertical direction keeps the same bodycentered 
tetragonal space group I4m2 after full geometry relaxation onto ground state structure leading to 
tetragonal C6 (Fig. 1b). The transformation scheme highlighting the C4 tetrahedra is proposed in 
Fig. 1c.
