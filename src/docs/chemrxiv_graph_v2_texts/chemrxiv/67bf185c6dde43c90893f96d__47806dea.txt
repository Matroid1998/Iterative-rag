Description:
Accounts for approximately 1.4% of global emissions due to ammonia production.

First developed in the early 20th century, the HaberBosch 
process to make ammonia has been instrumental in supporting 
the growth of approximately half of the world population via 
nitrogenbased fertilisers.1 Ammonia has further potential as a 
carbon free, readily liquified, and energy dense fuel.2 Howev
er, while efficient and welloptimised, the HaberBosch pro
cess is both extremely energy and carbon intensive. Haber
Bosch ammonia plants primarily rely on methane steam re
forming to obtain hydrogen gas, resulting in approximately 1.4 
 of global CO2 emissions and the use of 1  of global ener
gy requirements.1 Furthermore, the reaction requires extreme 
operation conditions (400C, 200 bar) to improve reaction 
kinetics3 , restricting HaberBosch ammonia production to 
large, centralised plants due to economies of scale.
