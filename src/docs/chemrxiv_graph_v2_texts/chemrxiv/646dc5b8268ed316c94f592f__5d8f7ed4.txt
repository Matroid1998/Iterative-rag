Description:
Substitution of Al by Sc is an effective way to lower the polarization switching voltage in wAlN.

In
this regard, the recent discovery of ferroelectricity in
CMOS compatible doped wAlN is highly promising be
cause of its high polarization and Curie temperature5
8.
wAlN posses large spontaneous polarization (130
Ccm2) when hexagonal AlN is considered as paraelec
tric phase7, 8. However, because of the high coercive
field, which is larger than its dielectric breakdown volt
age, FE switching in pure wAlN is impractical. Promis
ingly, the substitution of Al by Sc or codoping of Li and
VNbTa, is an effective way to lower the polarization
switching voltage58. Recently, ferroelectricity with
large polarization (125 Ccm2) was demonstrated in
Boron substituted wAlN thin films9, with Boron con
centrations in the range of 2  15.
