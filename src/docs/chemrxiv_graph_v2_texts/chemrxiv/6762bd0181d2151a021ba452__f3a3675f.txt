Description:
An aqueous solvent used in the rapid solvent shifting method for lignin nanoparticle production.

Text:
Lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) have gained a tremendous interest in academic research due to their 
potential to enhance the performance of technical lignins in many applications, including 
dispersants, nanocoatings, additives in adhesives, emulsifiers in cosmetics, and many more.17 
LNPs can be produced by different approaches (e.g., acidification, aerosol flow, mechanical 
treatment, reverse micelle formation), with rapid solvent shifting being among the more popular 
methods.1 Here, lignin is dissolved in an organic solvent (e.g., THF, aqueous acetone, etc.) and 
then rapidly poured into a vigorously stirred antisolvent (water). It has been hypothesized that the
