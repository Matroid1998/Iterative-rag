Description:
A class of compounds that includes sulfanilamide, used as antibacterial drugs.

Text:
Sulfanilamide is an anilinederived sulfonamide and one of the first synthesized
antibacterial drugs in the start of the 20th century. A limitation to antibacterial small
molecule drugs is the rapid tendency for bacteria to develop antibacterial resistance,
lending to an arms race between advances in novel drug production and evolution
driving survival of the fittest by selecting for antibioticresistant genes. Azo dyes
quickly became a desirable starting material to turn to sulfa drugs.
