Description:
Known for its exceptional hardness but relatively low thermal stability.

Text:
The properties of diamond, in particular its exceptional hardness but relatively low thermal stability, 
have prompted numerous experimental and theoretical studies aimed at finding substitutes for 
diamond, both in abrasives and tools, as well as in electronics and other applications. In this respect, 
the search for new binary and ternary superhard refractory phases of compounds of light elements 
(especially in the BCN system) seems to be the most promising 1,2. Diamond occurs in two forms, the common cubic (Fd3m) and the relatively rare hexagonal 
(P63mmc) (the socalled lonsdaleite), which are referred to as polytypes 3C and 2H, respectively. From the point of view of topology, these polytypes are referred to as dia and lon 3.
