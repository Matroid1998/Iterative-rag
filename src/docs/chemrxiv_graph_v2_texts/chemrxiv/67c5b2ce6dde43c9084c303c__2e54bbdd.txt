Other variations of cyanostar have also been made.9,14,16,20,22 Applications of

assemblies,1,9,16,1821,2428 and supramolecular polymer formation.13,21,2831 Cyanostar 
has been used as a dopant for polymer semiconductors,23 and as the key structuredirecting 
element in fluorescent materials called smallmolecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES).3039 
Cyanostar was the first anion receptor to engage cyanostilbenes for the purpose of stabilizing 
anions with CH hydrogen bonds and others have now followed suit.40,41 The five cyanostilbene 
units in the cyanostar macrocycle are a result of Knoevenagel condensations that occur in a high
yielding onepot cyclooligomerization using the appropriate cyanoaldehyde monomer.
