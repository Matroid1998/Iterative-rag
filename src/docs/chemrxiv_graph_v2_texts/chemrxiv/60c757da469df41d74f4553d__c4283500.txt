Description:
A porous network of sp2 carbon fibers used in carbonphenolic composites.

Space vehicles traveling at hypersonic speeds through a planetary atmosphere experience 
heat loads greater than 50 W cm2 and require a heat shield to protect the vehicle from severe 
heating 1. A class of materials used for several space missions comprises carbonphenolic 
composites, where a network of carbon fibers is infused with a phenolic resin. Heat shields undergo 
a process called ablation (loss of material) under these extreme conditions. Ablation can occur 
through pyrolysis, gassurface oxidation, and sublimation. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition 
of the phenolic resin, which occurs in the range of 2001000 C, where gaseous thermal 
decomposition products are expelled from the heat shield material 2,3. Pyrolysis exposes the 
underlying carbon fiber network, which is a porous network of sp2 carbon.
