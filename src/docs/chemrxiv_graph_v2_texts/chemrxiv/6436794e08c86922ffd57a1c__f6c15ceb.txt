Description:
An aromatic compound with hexagonal symmetry (D6h) where the HOMO and LUMO are doubly degenerate.

Text:
While the paradigm of triangular carbon nitrides and boron 
carbon nitrides has extensively been explored in recent computational work,1, 2, 16, 19, 20, 24 we ask in 
the present computational study whether other white spots may exist in chemical space with hitherto 
undiscovered symmetryenabled S1T1 inversion. The hexagonal symmetry (D6h) of benzene is the 
most natural symmetry for aromatic compounds. In benzene, the HOMO as well as the LUMO are 
doubly degenerate. As is well known, the HOMOLUMO transition in benzene gives rise to the six 
valence excited states three singlet states and three triplet states with the symmetries B2u, B1u, E1u 
within the D6h symmetry point group.

Description:
Exhibits an anomaly in its valence excitation spectrum with inverted energies of the 1B2u and 3B2u excited states.

Text:
The valence excitation spectrum of benzene exhibits an anomaly 
which is well known in principle, but has received little attention so far The energies of the 1B2u and 
3B2u excited states of benzene are inverted with a substantial (negative) energy gap of the order of 1.0 
eV.2530 Because two triplet states (3B1u, 3E1u) of benzene are located below the lowest singlet state 
(1B2u), the singlettriplet inversion in B2u symmetry is not relevant for the Jablonski diagram of 
benzene.

Description:
A molecule that can undergo energetic ordering manipulation through molecular frame extension or carbon atom substitution.

Text:
However, if the relative energetic ordering of the B2u, B1u and E1u manifolds of benzene 
could be manipulated by extension of the molecular frame andor by suitable substitutions of carbon 
atoms, the intrinsic 1B2u3B2u inversion in benzene could give rise to an excitation spectrum in which 
the 1B2u state becomes the lowest excited state, that is, a negative ST.
