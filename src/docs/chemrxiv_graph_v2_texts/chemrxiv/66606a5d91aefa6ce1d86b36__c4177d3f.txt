Description:
Subject to visible light activation enabling innovative new bond cleavage modes.

Text:
The vast majority 
of other studies have focused on achlorotoluene.2833 Lev
eraging benzyl chloride, known for its abundance and 
chemical stability, in visible light catalysis could signifi
cantly enhance the practicality of catalytic homocoupling 
and facilitate latestage functionalization. Visiblelight activation of alkyl chlorides has emerged as 
a vivid area of research, enabling innovative new bond 
cleavage modes.3436 Strategies based on single electron 
transfer (SET),3740 photoexcited transition metal,4145 nu
cleophilic metal,4649 or halogen atom transfer (XAT)5053 
have been established. PC
