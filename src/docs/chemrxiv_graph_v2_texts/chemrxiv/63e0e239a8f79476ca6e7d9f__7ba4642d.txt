Description:
Interest in heterosubstituted forms for potential medicinal chemistry applications.

. In 
2022, 
bicyclo3.1.1heptanes 
were 
demonstrated to mimic the fragment of metasubstituted 
benzenes in biologically active compounds. 1,2 Both cores had 
similar angles between the exit vectors (119120), a similar 
distance 
between 
substituents 
(4.85.0 
), 
and 
similar 
physicochemical properties (Scheme 1). Given our current 
interest in heterosubstituted bicycloalkanes, 3 we immediately 
became 
interested 
in 
adding 
a 
nitrogen 
atom 
to 
bicyclo3.1.1heptanes. Such systems could in theory mimic the 
fragment of pyridine and could also be additionally considered 
as nonchiral analogs of piperidines (Scheme 1). Both logics 
seemed to be interesting for medicinal chemistry applications. Having finished with a brilliant design of the target system, we 
faced a tiny problem, however we had absolutely no clue how to 
make it.
