Description:
Components of Lewy Bodies, which are intracellular inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases.

Text:
synuclein is a protein normally involved in synaptic vesicle
transport and exocytosis for neurotransmission13. Aggregation
of synuclein is a primary feature of the synucleinopathies, such
as Parkinsons Disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and
Lewy Body dementia (LBD)47. Neuropathological examination
of PD and LBD brains reveals the formation of intracellular inclu
sions called Lewy Bodies (LBs)46,810. LBs are spherical struc
tures consisting of aggregated synuclein in an amyloid con
formation1114, lipids, organelles and other proteins, such as cy
toskeletal proteins810. While the pathological importance of LBs
has been well known for decades, the mechanism behind their
