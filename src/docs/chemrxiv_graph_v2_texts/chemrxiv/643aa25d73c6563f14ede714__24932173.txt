Description:
A TMD that is chemically inert under most conditions and used in sensing platforms for gas detection.

Similarly to graphene,
TMD sheets interact in bulk crystals via weak van der Waals (vdW)
forces and thus can be effectively exfoliated. Atoms within individual
sheets are covalently bonded and have satisfied valence. This makes
TMD surfaces chemically inert under most conditions, which limits
their surface interactions to physisorption. TMDs such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have been shown
sensing platforms capable of effective detection of nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) 3235 and ammonia (NH3) 3538. However, their sensi
tivity toward other gas molecules (including SO2) was reported low
in comparison. The response of TMD sheets toward selected analytes
can be enhanced via substitutional doping 3948, or decoration of
their surfaces with single atoms 49, nanoparticles50, 51, and nan
otubes 18.
