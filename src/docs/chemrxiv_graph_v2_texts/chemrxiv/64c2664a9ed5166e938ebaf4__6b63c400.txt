Description:
A component of sodium-ion batteries, which are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to their use of more abundant resources.

Text:
Sodiumion batteries (SIBs) are a promising alternative to stateoftheart lithiumion 
batteries (LIBs). They are particularly beneficial as lowcost alternatives using more 
abundant resources that can be obtained from less critical economic, social and 
environmental sources15. The energy density of SIBs can be significantly higher than 
leadacid or nickel metal hydride batteries, while being close or even onpar with some 
LIB cell chemistries2. Moreover, SIBs can be assembled using LIB production lines, 
which means that the manufacturing processes are already accessible at industrial scale 
6. To reach a competitive level, however, progress in materials development and cycle 
life are still the most urging SIB research topics. An important strategy to improve the performance of batteries is to understand gas 
formation during cell cycling.
