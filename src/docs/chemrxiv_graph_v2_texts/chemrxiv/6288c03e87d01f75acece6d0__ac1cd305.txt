Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical conversion to higher-value products to mitigate climatic impact.

Text:
In recent years, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into highervalue products has been 
introduced as a promising and technologically feasible approach for mitigating the negative 
climatic impact of the steadily increasing levels of atmospheric CO2.13 The CO2 reduction 
reaction (CO2RR) may become not only economically feasible but also truly sustainable if the 
surplus of renewable energy originating from solar radiation, wind power, and hydroelectric 
sources is used as energy input to drive the highly endergonic and kinetically hindered CO2 
conversion. The overall electrolysis reaction relies on an oxidative splitting of water (i.e., oxygen 
evolution reaction, OER) through 
O2  4e 4H 2H2O (acidic) Eq. 1 
or 
O2  2H2O  4e4OH (alkaline) Eq. 2 
which is coupled to the reductive conversion of CO2 (denoted hereafter CO2RR).
