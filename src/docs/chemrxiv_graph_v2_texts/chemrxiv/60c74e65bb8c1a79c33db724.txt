Description:
An attractive scaffold being modified to develop new therapeutic options for leishmaniasis and other parasitic diseases.

Here is where software 
and new computational tools may help to understand better how 
to alter such structures.3,4 
For instance, one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases is 
leishmaniasis. The clinical manifestations may range from single 
cutaneous lesions (CL) to fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This 
disease is endemic in 98 countries with an annual estimated 
incidence of 300,000 of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases and 1 
million of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)5,6. Our group works in modifications of the attractive scaffold 
quinazoline, to develop new therapeutic options for leishmaniasis 
and other parasitic diseases. This quinazoline nucleus has shown 
versatility in different diseases and specificity to some targets.
