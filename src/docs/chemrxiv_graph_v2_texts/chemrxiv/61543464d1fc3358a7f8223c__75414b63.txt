Regulates fundamental physiological processes in cells, including oxygen metabolism and signaling pathways.

Over the last decades, intelligent polymers have been 
developed to be responsive to several stimuli, like pH,3 temperature,4 and small molecule or 
biomacromolecular signals.5 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, regulate fundamental physiological 
processes in cells, including oxygen metabolism and signaling pathways.67 However, in cancers 
and inflammatory,68 cardiovascular9 or neurodegenerative diseases,1011 ROS are produced at 
a rate that natural antioxidant mechanisms, like enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase), 
cannot overcome.1214 Elevated intracellular H2O2 concentrations in diseased tissues are typically 
between 10 and 100 M,1516 and can go up to 10 mM.17 This change in the oxidative state of 
the cellular environment can be used as a trigger for selective local cargo release.1820
