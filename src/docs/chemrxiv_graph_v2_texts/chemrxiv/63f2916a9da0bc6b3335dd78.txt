Description:
Involved in the reduction reaction to water, releasing energy for electricity generation.

Text:
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the reduction of oxygen to water, which releases energy 
that can be used to generate electricity.1 In terms of the efficiency of electricity generation, 
electrochemical fuel cells containing an appropriate catalyst are more efficient than burning H2 
and O2 to generate heat to run a turbine. The best catalysts for ORR contain platinum,1,2 and while 
alternative materials have been considered,35 it has proven quite challenging to optimize the 
efficiency of ORR electrocatalysts.6,7 
In terms only of the efficiency of ORR, articulating the effect of this ideal electrocatalyst on the 
catalytic cycle is easy, but rather difficult to actualize. The ideal electrocatalyst would harvest the 
same amount of energy per electron transferred in each step of the overall electrochemical 
reaction 4H!

Description:
An element that forms species such as O2H and OH, which are involved in forming and breaking bonds with catalysts.

e R  HO, which is caused by the fact that active sites that bind one oxygen 
species strongly, such as O2H, are likely to strongly bind to other oxygen species, such as OH.6 
This is especially apparent for these two steps because they each involve forming and breaking 
bonds between the catalyst and an oxygen species. Within the framework of understanding provided by scaling relations, ORR catalyst design 
strategies can be classified as either seeking to modify an existing catalyst to push the new 
catalyst closer to the optimal oxygen binding strength along the scaling relations, or to favorably 
break these scaling relations. Although the latter would be necessary to obtain the ideal catalyst
