Description:
A component of amineboranes with a gravimetric content of 19.6.

Text:
The dehydrogenation of AB under mild and controlled conditions is of 
substantial importance in the context of hydrogen fuel economy as the 
gravimetric hydrogen content of AB is 19.6.8 Though a lot of early 
and late transition metal catalysts such as Ti, Ni, Ru, Fe, Pt, Pd, Cr, Ir 
etc. are reported in scientific literature for extracting two bipolar 
hydrogens from amineboranes, the use of these metals has always 
proved to be cumbersome.9 Recent advancement in amineborane 
dehydrogenation mostly focuses on designing effective nonmetal
based 
catalysts.
