Description:
The element forming the basis of materials like graphene and graphynes, known for its structural and electronic properties.

Text:
Carbonbased materials such as graphene and graphynes (GYs) have garnered considerable 
interest as potential candidates for gas separation, energy storage materials, isotope separation, 
catalysis, water purification, and optoelectronic devices, owing to their distinctive structural 
and electronic properties.16 Numerous studies have shown that GYs, in particular, hold 
promise as electrode materials in lithiumion batteries.6, 7 GYs are carbon allotropes akin to 
graphene, first proposed by Baughman and coworkers in 1987.8 They can be theoretically 
derived from graphene by introducing acetylenic linkages (CC) between the CC bonds of 
graphene. GYs can be classified into various forms based on the arrangement and number of 
their acetylenic linkages. These include types like , , , and rhombicGY, as well as 
subclasses such as GY1, GY2, etc.

Description:
Forms unique frameworks with sp and sp hybridization in GYs.

Text:
For instance, in the GY series, GY1 represents a 
structure with one acetylenic linkage, while GY2 represents a structure with two acetylenic 
linkages, and so forth. Although first theoretically predicted by Baughman and coworkers, 
several of these forms have since been successfully synthesized.911 Notably, GYs were the 
first form to be synthesized and are, therefore, the most characterized and explored.1215 The 
unique combination of sp and sp hybridized carbon atoms in GYs provides a distinctive 
framework that allows for more efficient accommodation of lithium ions compared to the 
traditional carbonbased materials like graphite.
