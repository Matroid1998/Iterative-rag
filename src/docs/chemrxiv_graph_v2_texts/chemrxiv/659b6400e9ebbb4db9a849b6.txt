A material with elevated conductivity and hardness.

of metal ions could significantly impact the water 
absorption capacity of the hydrogel25, leading to limited Cu2 
loading (9.90 wt) and resulting in defects such as layered cracks 
in the subsequent sintered samples. Herein, we present a facile and robust strategy for the 
creation of complex and dense microarchitected copper with 
elevated conductivity and hardness (Figure 1a). The process 
involves the utilization of a waterbased photoresin containing ion
exchangeable monomers, enabling the sculpting of 3D hydrogel 
scaffolds via DLP. Subsequent immersion of these scaffolds in a 
CuSO4 solution results in a notable high loading of Cu2 ions 
(20.31 wt) achieved through ion exchange.

Description:
Exhibits a microcrystalline and compact microstructure with a high twin density.

Text:
Following debinding 
in air and sintering in a reducing atmosphere, the resulting copper 
architectures exhibit a minimum feature size of approximately 40 
m, accompanied by a high twin density and substantial copper 
content 
(96.2 
wt). The 
microstructure 
of 
copper 
is 
microcrystalline and compact, featuring an average grain size of 
6.5 m and 4.6  2.2 twins per grain. These findings underscore 
the powerful capability of this methodology in creating micro
architected 3D metal structures. A waterbased photoresin was developed, comprising 
sodium acrylate as an ionexchangeable monomer, polyethylene 
glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) as a crosslinker, PEGBAPO26 as a 
highly efficient waterborne photoinitiator, tartrazine as a photo
blocker to finetune printing resolution27, and cellulose 
nanocrystals (CNCs) as a toughening agent28 (Figure 1b).
