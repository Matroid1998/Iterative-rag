Description:
The staggered conformation of ethane is relatively stable due to steric factors and hyperconjugation.

Text:
Even when steric effect reasoning correctly predicts the 
result, controversy ensues. For example, a number of organic 
chemistry textbooks attributed the relative stability of the 
staggered conformation of ethane to steric factor alone. This 
has led to controversy discussed at length across the scientific 
community for over eight years.18 
Electron delocalization effects, on the other hand, are 
relatively more complicated. The reasoning for energy 
prediction often involves resonance structures915 (formerly 
called 
mesomeric 
effect) 
or 
hyperconjugation1620 
(delocalization) of orbitals. Specific reasonings for each case of 
exceptions to steric prediction are shown in Table 1. The 
preference for Z configuration and gauche conformation are 
primarily due to hyperconjugation in a similar vein to the ethane 
case,17, 18 but the reasoning underlying the preference for meta 
isomer is still lacking.
