Description:
Lighter element used as a support for catalyst particles.

Smallangle Xray scattering (SAXS) is a useful method for characterizing the structure 
of catalyst particles for fuel cells and other applications 12. In these applications, the 
nanometersized catalyst particles, typically made of platinum (hereafter Pt), are 
supported on larger particles made of lighter elements, typically carbon 37. Determining the particlesize distribution of the catalysts is important, because it allows 
for the estimation of the catalytic surface area, which is directly related to the catalytic 
activity of the whole system. The growth of catalyst particles during fuel cell operation is 
a major source of catalyst degradation. Particle sizes can be determined by several techniques, including SAXS, widerangle 
Xray diffraction (XRD), Xray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) 89.
