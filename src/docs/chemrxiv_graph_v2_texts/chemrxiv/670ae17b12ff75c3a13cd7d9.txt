Description:
A tetrahedral building unit in zeolite frameworks.

Text:
Zeolites are crystalline nanoporous materials extensively used in catalysis and sorption due to their 
welldefined pore architectures that allow molecules to diffuse through and interact with the bulk of 
the crystal.1 Different arrangements of the tetrahedral TO4 (T Si, Al, B, etc.) building units results in 
zeolite frameworks with different pore sizes and channel dimensions enabling shapeselective 
catalytic properties. To date, there are 256 framework types reported in the IZA Database of Zeolite
