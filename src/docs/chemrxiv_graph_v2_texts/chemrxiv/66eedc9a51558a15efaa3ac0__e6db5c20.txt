Description:
Enhances methanol selectivity and can switch the general reaction outcome in Cu-based catalysts.

Text:
In Cubased materials, Zn is wellknown to greatly enhance methanol selectivity.10, 11 Other 
13 
reducible elements, in particular Ga, have also been shown to enhance methanol selectivity of Cu
14 
based catalysts.1214 Additionally, Ga is able to switch the general reaction outcome.

Description:
Reported to switch the RWGS activity of noble metals like Pd and Pt to methanol formation.

Text:
For instance, Ni
15 
catalysts, which under CO2 hydrogenation conditions are very wellknown for their selectivity towards 
16 
methane, produce methanol at low pressure in the presence of Ga.1517 More recently, Ga was reported 
17 
to even switch the RWGS activity of noble metals like Pd and Pt to methanol formation with exceptional 
18 
activity.1821 Detailed investigations for the PdGa and PtGasystems using Surface Organometallic 
19 
Chemistry (SOMC) have shown that redox dynamics involving MGaGaOx (M  Pd or Pt) interfaces 
20 
are responsible for promoting methanol formation with high activity.20, 21 
21 
Considering the wellknown methanation activity of group 89 transition metals (Ru, Os, Rh, and 
22 
Ir), 2225 we thus reasoned, that it was worth exploring how Ga would affect the reactivity patterns and 
23 
the structure of these metals.
