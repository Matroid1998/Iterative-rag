Description:
A group that is rapidly isomerised to the Z-vinyl ether by KOtBu.

Text:
Here the allyl group is rapidly isomerised to the Zvinyl ether by KOtBu,41 which 
cannot undergo unfavourable 5endotrig or 4exotrig cyclisations and thus the intermolecular BHAS 
coupling product is obtained (67). Pyridinebased heteroarylderived products 3jk were obtained 
from the corresponding bromides in moderate yields (5149), expanding the potential applications of 
this system to heteroaryl halides. Scheme 4. Expected KIE effects via organometallic or radical reaction routes.
