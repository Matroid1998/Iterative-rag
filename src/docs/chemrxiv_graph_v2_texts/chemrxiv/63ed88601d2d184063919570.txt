Description:
Part of an indeterminate compound with carbon and hydrogen reported to exhibit room temperature superconductivity.

Text:
Activity surrounds highpressure hydrides due to reports of superconductivity near room
temperature.1 In an effort to realise the prediction that hydrogen would become a room
temperature superconductor under sufficient pressure,2 a variety of hydrogenrich binary
materials AHx have been predicted and synthesized. Among nonmetal elements the sulfur
hydride system has been fruitful, with H3S predicted and confirmed to be a superconductor
with a critical temperature Tc of 203 K,3,4 and controversy surrounds reports of room
temperature superconductivity in an indeterminate compound of carbon, sulfur, and hy
drogen.57 Metalhydride systems have produced a number of superhydrides, particularly
involving metals near the sd border of the periodic table.
