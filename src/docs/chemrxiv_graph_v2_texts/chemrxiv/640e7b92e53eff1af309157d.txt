Due to their lightweight, durability, and costeffectiveness, plastics are widely used in a variety 
45 
of domestic and industrial applications, which has led to skyrocketing production.1, 2 About 391 
46 
million tons of plastics was produced in 2021, and production is estimated to double in the 
47 
upcoming 20 years.1, 3, 4 High global plastic production and use have led to increasing amount 
48 
of plastic waste in the environment,58 with about 80 of the plastic waste generated 
49 
accumulating in landfills or in natural waters.1, 9, 10 Plastics (andor their debris) may occur as 
50 
macroplastics (size  25 mm), mesoplastics (525 mm), microplastics (0.1 m5 mm), and 
51 
nanoplastics (1100 nm).8, 11, 12 Microplastics (MPs) have been identified as a major, global 
52 
challenge in aquatic and terrestrial environments.9, 10 MPs can be intentionally engineered to 
53 
have small size (primary MPs) or may form from the fragmentation of larger plastics 
54 
(secondary MPs).1316 The ecological risks of MPs may arise from their physical properties 
55 
(e.g., sharp edges), chemical properties (e.g., leaching of additives),8, 1719 andor their ability 
56 
to concentrate and transport other contaminants.2, 20

MPs have a tendency to adsorb a wide variety of legacy and emerging contaminants, including 
59 
per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).2, 21 PFAS are currently one of the most important 
60 
emerging contaminants due to their ubiquity, persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation in 
61 
organisms.2224 Both PFAS and MPs were recently detected in the guts of organisms in the 
62 
Mississippi coast,25 which suggests that MPs may transport PFAS into organisms.
