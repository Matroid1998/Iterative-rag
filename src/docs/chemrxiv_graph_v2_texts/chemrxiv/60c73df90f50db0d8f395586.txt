Description:
An HIV protease inhibitor that failed dissolution requirements due to solubility issues.

Text:
Solubility is a critical property for pharmaceutical drug
discovery, and problems with solubility can frustrate drug
discovery efforts and block treatments. The bioavailabil
ity of a drug depends on the solubility difference between
different crystal structures (polymorphs), dose, drug per
meability, and formulation 1, so solubility plays a key
role. Solubility problems can be unexpected and pose
crucial obstacles that even threaten the administration
of care. For example, a welldocumented case occurred
in the late 90s when ritonavir, an HIVprotease inhibitor
marketed as Norvir, failed dissolution requirements 2. Since ritonavir is not bioavailable in its solid form, it was
administrated in capsules containing solutions designed
not to be saturated with respect to the originally known
molecular crystal (form I) 2.
