Description:
Trivalent phosphorus-based functional groups known for their donor abilities.

Text:
Such 
systems typically rely on a phosphorusbased 
functional group that is responsible for interacting or 
binding with the metal, taking advantage of the well
established donor abilities of trivalent phosphines or 
pentavalent PO containing moieties, such as 
phosphine oxides or phosphoric acid derivatives. This 
is tethered to a fluorescent backbone, allowing for a 
turnoff or turnon response in the presence of metal 
ions (Figure 1A). In 2016, Christianson and Gabba 
reported a phosphinedecorated fluorescein, in which 
an arylphosphine was linked to the fluorescein 
backbone via an ophenylene group.10 Coordination 
of the phosphine to Au3 yielded a turnon 
fluorescence response, and use of the system as a 
sensor for Au3 in water.
