Description:
Materials with disordered nanoporous structures that pose challenges in characterizing ionic transport.

Efficient ionic transport is crucial for maintaining performance at high 
chargedischarge rates6,7, particularly in thick electrodes that can be used to increase 
supercapacitor energy density810. Mesoporosity (i.e. pores with diameter 250 nm) is often suggested as a critical component 
for efficient ionic transport, serving as a bridge between micropores (where charge storage 
occurs) and the bulk electrolyte1116. Ordered mesoporosity, in particular, has been suggested 
to enhance rate capability by reducing diffusion limitations under high current densities17,810. However, mesopores dont necessarily enhance ionic transport in carbon materials18,19, and 
the relationship between mesoporosity and rate capability remains insufficiently understood, 
as characterizing ionic transport within disordered nanoporous carbons poses significant 
challenges. Several techniques have been employed to analyze the pore structures of nanoporous carbon 
materials, each with inherent limitations.
