Description:
A synthetically accessible, metallic polytype of MoS2.

Text:
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is among the most studied transition metal dichalcogenides, a 
family of materials characterized by their twodimensional character with individual layers 
stacked by van der Waals forces1. MoS2 has gained attention due to its applicability in a wide 
range of fields like electrochemical energy storage2, 3 and electrocatalysis4, 5. There are 
several polytypes of MoS2, with the naturally occurring, semiconducting 2HMoS2 and 3R
MoS2 polytypes, and the synthetically accessible, metallic 1TMoS26. The functional 
properties of MoS2 are highly dependent on the polytype, as well as on the morphology and 
crystallite size of the material, which is why synthesis strategies able to control these 
properties are required7, 8.
