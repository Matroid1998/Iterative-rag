The lightest element, playing a significant role in enzymatic reactions involving proton transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and hydride transfer processes.

This 
neglect is particularly problematic in systems where hydrogen, the lightest element, 
plays a significant role, as seen in many enzymatic reactions involving proton 
transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, andor hydride transfer processes.2933 
To address this challenge, several theories have been developed to 
conduct QMMM calculations with nuclear quantum effects included. One such 
successful approach is pathintegralbased methods, which represent quantum 
systems using ensembles of replicas connected by harmonic springs.3440 Path
integralbased QMMM methods have been successfully applied to study proton 
transfer,41 hydride transfer,42 and RNA cleavage reactions.43 Although a major 
limitation of pathintegral based methods is the high computational cost, especially 
if ab initio potential energy surfaces for the QM part are to be used, recent
