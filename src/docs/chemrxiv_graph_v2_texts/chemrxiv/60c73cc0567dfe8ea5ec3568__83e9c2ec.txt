Description:
A pentavalent species that is less toxic than trivalent forms.

Text:
Additionally, the toxicity of methylarsenicals depends on their 
44 
methylation degree and pH 7; pentavalent TMAV, MMAV, and DMAV species are less toxic 
45 
than inorganic pentavalent arsenicals (iAsV); while the trivalent MMAIII, DMAIII, and TMAIII 
46 
species are much more toxic than inorganic trivalent forms (iAsIII). Thus, the toxicity depends 
47 
on the uptake rate of each arsenic compound where less toxic species (pentavalent forms) 
48 
can be converted to the more toxic species (trivalent forms) increasing in the following order; 
49 
TMAV  MMAV  DMAV  iAsV iAsIII  MMAIII  DMAIII  TMAIII8,9. 50 

In this regard, twodimensional 2D materials are a useful alternative for drinking 
51 
water treatment via physicalchemical adsorption of arsenic pollutants, favored by their high 
52 
surface area, high adsorption capacity, and high recovery and reusability10,11.
