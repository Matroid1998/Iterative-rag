Products formed with moderated to excellent diastereoselectivity.

(3) Simultaneous activation of BCBs by nucleophiles 
and electrophiles. This method usually relies on the 1,2
migration 
process 
of 
BCBboronate 
complexes, 
and 
functionalization by capture of an electrophile, therefore 
leading to the 1,1,3trisubstituted cyclobutane products with 
moderated to excellent diastereoselectivity.7eg (4) Palladium 
hydride enabled hydroalkenylation of BCBs to afford 1,1
disubstituted cyclobutanes.16 (5) Polarityreversal strategy. In 
2020, Grykos group disclosed an elegant work on umpolung 
BCB activation with Co(I) complexes. Co(I)catalysis allowed the 
in situ formation of nucleophilic cyclobutyl radicals upon light
