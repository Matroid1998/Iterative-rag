Description:
Serve as substrates in the ATP-dependent formation of acylCoA thioesters.

ACLs catalyze 
ATPdependent formation of acylCoA thioesters from 
carboxylic acids in twostep reaction first formation of 
adenylate derivative from carboxylic acid and ATP, second, 
nucleophilic attack of coenzyme A (HSCoA).21 Diversion of the 
native reaction by adding extra amine nucleophile in absence of 
HSCoA leads to the formation of amides.20,2224 Thus, ACLs 
represent an alternative biocatalytic system for amide 
synthesis. Combined with upstream catalytic formation of 
carboxylic acids from alcohols available from renewable 
sources, this process offers a sustainable pathway for amide 
synthesis. This strategy, with sequential catalytic steps where 
each step is catalyzed by a different type of catalyst, here 
heterogeneous catalyst and biocatalyst, is called hybrid 
catalysis.
