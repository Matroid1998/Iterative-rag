Description:
Used for green hydrogen generation through catalytic decomposition.

Text:
Many kinds of composite materials have been engineered for the catalytic decomposition of organic
compounds through hydrolysis reaction, as the case of ammonia borane (AB), amine borane, for green hydrogen
generation. These designed materials could be based on transition metals nanoparticles in unit with diverse form
of supporting materials17,18. Both catalytic hydrogenation of (COCO2Olefins) and ultradeep desulfurization
of transportation fuels have been widely discussed through diverse ways with the aid of designed catalytic
composite materials, which present high yield of hydrocarbons generation and suitable sulfur removal from
gasoline fuels, as evidenced in this papers 19,21. these are an important issues as they contribute to limit the
percentage of greenhouse gases in our environment, which is beneficial for mankind.
