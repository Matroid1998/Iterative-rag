Description:
A metal whose morphology during electrodeposition is crucial for battery research, particularly in the stability of the lithium metal anode over repeated cycles.

Text:
Control over the morphology of lithium metal during electrodeposition has become a major 
topic in battery research1, with many works focusing on the stability of the lithium metal 
anode over repeated electroplating and stripping cycles25. Cycling and subsequent 
observation, typically done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), does not always 
provide the full picture however, as illustrated in literature by recent mechanistic insights 
obtained using a variety of additional techniques to study the growth of lithium metal612. Furthermore, the wide range of electrolyte systems used13 makes it difficult to compare 
results between different reports or to disentangle physical14 and chemical15 effects 
responsible for uncontrolled lithium growth.

Forms smooth morphologies attributed to electrostatic shielding.

Growth of smooth lithium morphologies 
attributed to electrostatic shielding for example16, was later found to consist of a particular 
selfaligned and compact nanorod morphology17. Such a columnar morphology is very similar to the results first obtained by Kanamura et al.18 
using HF as an additive, and later with trace amounts of water for the insitu formation of HF 
through the hydrolysis of an LiPF6 electrolyte19. This growth mode is commonly attributed to 
the formation of a LiF solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer mainly based on Xray 
photoelectron spectroscopy2022. So far, deposition of columnar lithium layers has attracted
