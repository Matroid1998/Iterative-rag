Description:
The earliest compound containing Blatter radical with the zwitterionic groundstate.

further opening the doors to be utilized in devices.32 Its stability has been
validated by interfacing with gold substrates by Low et al.33 Very recently, Gallego et al. achieved the simultaneous enhancement in the conductance and the Seebackcoefficient by
bridging the Blatters radical between gold electrodes.34
Tetraphenylhexaazaanthracene (TPHA) is the earliest compound containing Blatter rad
ical with the zwitterionic groundstate.35 Recently, Rajca et al. synthesized stable diradicals
by coupling the Blatter radical with the nitronyl nitroxide radical and diBlatter diradical
