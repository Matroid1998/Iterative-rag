Description:
A carbon-free fuel generated through photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Text:
The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission produced from fossil fuel combustion has been identified 
as a primary contributor to global warming. It is urgent to develop efficient methods for 
generating 
renewable 
and 
clean 
energy 
while 
eliminating 
CO2 
emissions.1 
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is regarded as a promising strategy for converting 
intermittent sunlight into carbonfree hydrogen fuel.2,3 In PEC systems, semiconducting 
materials are employed as photoelectrodes, absorbing photons to generate electronhole pairs, 
thereby driving the hydrogen reduction or oxygen oxidation reactions.
