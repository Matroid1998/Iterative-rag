Description:
One of the most abundant trace acids in the atmosphere, focused on in new particle formation research.

Text:
Atmospheric aerosols have profound impacts on climate and health.1,2 Secondary aerosols
in the atmosphere start as small, gasphase molecular clusters formed by clustering of low
volatility gases, and can eventually impact climate by growing into cloud condensation nuclei
(CCN).35 The initial step, called new particle formation (NPF), has been suggested to ac
count for 1090 of CCN around the Earth.610 The uncertainty in anthropogenic warming
associated with aerosolcloud interactions in climate models are large owing to a limited
understanding of the various sources and sinks of particles as well as the complex nature
of the NPF mechanism.1113 Efforts to understand NPF at a molecular level have revealed
that gas phase acidbase chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of small, thermo
dynamically stable prenucleation clusters.1417 As one of the most abundant trace acids
in the atmosphere, sulfuric acid has been a focus of NPF research.

Description:
Forms clusters stabilized by bases through proton transfer and hydrogen bonds.

Text:
However, bases such
as ammonia, amines, and diamines have been shown to stabilize atmospherically relevant
sulfuric acid clusters, thereby accelerating growth.1727 Proton transfer between sulfuric acid
and bases leads to stabilization by a balance between Coulombic forces and hydrogen bonds
in the clusters.24
Organic molecules have been identified as key players in both the nucleation and growth
