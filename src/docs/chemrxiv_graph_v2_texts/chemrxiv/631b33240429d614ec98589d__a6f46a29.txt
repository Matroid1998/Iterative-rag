Description:
A piezoelectric material with coefficients that can exceed d33 600 pC/N.

In the converse piezoelec
tric effect, di,j  (iEj), an electrical field induces a
mechanical strain . Piezoelectric coefficients include the
longitudional and transverse coefficients, d33, d31, and
shear coefficients include d15, d24, d16, and the faceshear
mode d36, some of which are equivalent or vanish depend
ing on the crystal symmetry. The desired piezoelectric material properties depend
on the application. Highpower applications typically re
quire large dijs but are tolerant to frequency and temper
ature instability 13. Typical piezoelectric coefficients
for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) can exceed d33  600 pCN
14, 15. Low power applications, such as RF filters, on
the other hand, require stable coefficients as a function
of frequency. AlN, a material used for this purpose, has

a small but stable d33 of 3.4 pCN 16.
