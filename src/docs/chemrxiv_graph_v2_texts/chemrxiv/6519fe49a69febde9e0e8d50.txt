According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 
2019, approximately 1.74 billion people required treatment 
for neglected tropical diseases, including soiltransmitted 
helminths 1. Common species that affect people are thread
worms (Strongyloides stercoralis), hookworms (Ancy
lostoma duodenale and Necator americanus), and round
worms (Ascaris lumbricoides). These worms feed on iron 
and protein from the host tissues, causing infections with 
symptoms ranging from abdominal pain 2 to anemia 3, and 
physical and cognitive growth impairments, affecting chil
dren worse than adults 4. Some parasites also cause loss of 
appetite, diarrhea, or dysentery, reducing nutritional in
take and starvation. Soiltransmitted helminth infections 
are a significant problem for developing nations in tropical 
and subtropical areas.
