Description:
An amino acid involved in the active site of the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine enzyme, essential for coronavirus polyprotein processing.

The crystal structure of coronavirus COVID19 main protease was studied by medicinal chemists 
around all the world to develop antiviral drugs. It was mentioned that the COVID19 doesnt produce 
many proteins and by the way, there are not many targets for coronavirus inhibition. The three
dimensional structure of coronavirus main protease is like that of SARSCoV Mpro, its RNA genome 
is about 82 like SARSCoV which belongs to the betacoronavirus genus 1,2. The COVID19 has 
been named SARSCoV2 and its drug target is Mpro (3chymotrypsinlike cysteine enzyme) which 
is the essential enzyme for coronavirus processing the polyproteins 35. Mpro yields about 790 kDa polypeptide at different 11 spots of the large polyprotein which is the 
key to viral reproduction 6.
