Description:
Chemical group decorating pore edges in graphene.

Text:
scale pores in graphene for CO2 separation 
are prepared by oxidation involving controlled lattice gasification.5,22,3137 The resulting pore edges 
are passivated with O functional groups.3840 These groups evolve from the chemisorption of a single 
epoxy followed by an organization of epoxies in a cluster (Supplementary Section 1).37 When the 
cluster size is sufficiently large, strainmediated CC bond cleavage followed by gasification yields a 
carbon vacancy defect (pore) with ether41 and semiquinones (CO) decorated at the pore edge.40,42
44 Pores formed in this way have yielded attractive carbon capture performances, however, pores 
terminated with CO have not been explored by computational studies.
