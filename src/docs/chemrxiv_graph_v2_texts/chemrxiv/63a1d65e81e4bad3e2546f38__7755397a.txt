Description:
Products derived from hydrothermal liquefaction of lignin using water as a reactant and catalyst.

The most common applications for various technical lignins without extensive 
47 
modifications are for example Surface active agents, additives in bitumen, cement, and animal feed as 
48 
well as embedding in phenolic resins, elastomers, and polyolefins69. 49 
At present, there are various ways to process lignin into potentially valuable chemicals. Hetero and 
50 
homogeneous hydrogenolysis can be used to form lowmolarmass compounds, phenolic compounds, and 
51 
oxygenated and deoxygenated aromatics1013. The main products formed by pyrolysis are biochar, biooil, 
52 
and synthesis gas1416. Hydrothermal liquefaction offers another possibility to convert lignin into low
53 
molecularmass products such as phenols or methoxyphenolics. Here, water is used simultaneously as 
54 
reactant and catalyst under subcritical or supercritical conditions17,18. 55
