Description:
An apolar or weakly polar bulky terminal group.

Text:
Liquid crystals for display applications typically comprise a rigid core unit flanked with a 
terminal chain and a polar terminal group. The need to engineer the properties of nematic 
liquidcrystals has led to an understanding of how changes to molecular structure impact the 
bulk properties of these materials. Positioning a bulky group at the end of the terminal chain 
can lead to reductions in melting points with only minimal change in the clearing point; 17 
electronwithdrawing end groups (Cl, Br, ArFn) can suppress the SmA mesophase of 
cyanobiphenyl derived LCs 8 although in phenylpyrimidinederived materials these halogen 
terminated end groups can actually stabilise the SmA state. 9 Apolar or weakly polar bulky 
terminal groups (C(CH3)3 etc.)
