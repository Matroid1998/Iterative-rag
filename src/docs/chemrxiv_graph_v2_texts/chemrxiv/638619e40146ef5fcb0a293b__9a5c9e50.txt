In turn, sodium ion chemistries such as Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) hard carbon (HC) and 
Prussian blue analogs (PBA) hard carbon offer highpower capabilities making them more attractive 
and cheaper alternatives for highpower applications610 such as hybrid grid storage, power tools, fast 
(dis)charging electromotive, military equipment, etc. In this context, our group in collaboration with the Naion battery startup TIAMAT Energy 
(France) is actively working to develop highpower NVPF  HC based Naion cells. NVPF is a 
structurally robust material, which usually shows a reversible capacity of 120 mAhg (Supporting 
Fig. S1) and exhibits excellent cycling performance at ambient temperature.1113 The NVPF voltage 
profile displays two distinct steps (Supporting Fig. S1) at 3.7 V and 4.2 V, corresponding to the 
subsequent (de)insertion of two sodium ions from one formula unit.
