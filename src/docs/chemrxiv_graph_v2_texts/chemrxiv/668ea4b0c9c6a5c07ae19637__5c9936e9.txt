Description:
A material known for its exceptional coordination and dissociation ability towards Li salt, excellent interfacial stability with Li metal, and high mechanical strength.

Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) has become the leading material for SPEs since the 1970s because 
of its exceptional coordination and dissociation ability towards Li salt, excellent interfacial 
stability with Li metal, and high mechanical strength to form flexible membranes.7,8,9 
Specifically, high molecular weight PEO shows the advantages of preventing Li dendrites and 
improved cycling stability due to its prominent mechanical property compared to lower 
molecular weight PEO.10 However, PEObased SPEs are often criticized for their limited 
electrochemical stability window (ESW) primarily owing to the low oxidative stability of ether 
oxygen and limited room temperature ionic conductivity (up to 106 S cm1) due to their 
crystallization tendency that restricts polymer segmental motion for ion transport.9 These 
limitations significantly restrict their operational voltage range ( 4V) and fast cycling 
capability in solidstate LMBs.
