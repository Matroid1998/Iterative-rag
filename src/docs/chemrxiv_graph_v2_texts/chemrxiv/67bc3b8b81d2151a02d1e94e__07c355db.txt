Description:
A heavy atom that can induce a large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in MRTADF molecules.

kRISC is largely dependent on the magnitude of the SOC (V), which is proportional to the atomic 
nuclear charge 
 of the atoms involved in the emissive transition. Previous works have shown that 
introducing heavy atoms such as bromine,9 iodine,10 sulfur,11 and selenium12 can induce a large 
SOC in MRTADF molecules, thereby accelerating kRISC to greater than 105 s1, and leading to an 
improve exciton utilization in the device.1a 
The benzothienocarbazole (BTC) regioisomeric moieties, with their moderately heavy S atom (ZN 16), 
rigid skeleton, and moderately strong electrondonating strength,13 have been used in DA TADF 
emitter design.
