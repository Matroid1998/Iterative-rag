Description:
A conjugated polymer whose crystallization and alignment can be enhanced through UV irradiation and solution processing techniques.

Separately, the solution shearing 
and nanowire aggregation led to improved alignment and mobility in the printed films compared 
to pristine solutions and spincoated films, while a combination of both led to the highest 
improvement overall. Additionally, Wang and Reichmanis et al.2 employed UV irradiation 
during solution coating with microstructured blades that induce strong local shear and extension. They found the combined effect led to enhanced crystallization and alignment of P3HT. These 
results highlight the fact that the conjugated polymer solution state, fluid flow during processing, 
and their interplay can be harnessed to improve the effectiveness of solution processing.
