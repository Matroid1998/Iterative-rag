of new C(sp3)coupling partners within this paradigm can 
provide entry to novel, medicinallyrelevant chemical space. Alkenes are abundant, benchstable and undergo facile 
C(sp3)radical reactivity via metalhydride hydrogen atom 
transfer (MHAT), yet metallaphotoredox methodologies in
voking this strategy remain underdeveloped. Importantly, 
the merger of MHAT activation with metallaphotoredox ca
talysis could enable crosscoupling of olefins with feedstock 
radical partners only activated via photocatalysis, such as 
alcohols. Herein, we report the first C(sp3)C(sp3) coupling 
of MHATactivated alkenes with alcohols (i.e. deoxygena
tive hydroalkylation) via triple cocatalysis. Through syner
gistic Ir photocatalysis, Mn MHAT and Ni radical sorting 
pathways, this branchselective protocol pairs diverse ole
fins with methanol or primary alcohols, displays remarka
ble functional group tolerance, and enables the rapid con
struction of complex aliphatic frameworks.

Description:
An ideal, nontraditional motif to activate for metal-based fragment couplings via photoredox.

Text:
To this end, a central goal in metallaphotoredox has been the 
incorporation of underutilized yet advantageous C(sp3)radical 
progenitors within openshell crosscoupling systems.3 Among 
many possibilities, we recently identified olefins as an ideal, 
nontraditional motif to activate for metalbased fragment cou
plings via photoredox. Alkenes, which are naturally occurring 
or readily furnished from halide, alcohol, and carbonyl precur
sors, represent a structurally varied, benchstable substrate class 
far more commercially accessible than traditional electrophilic 
and organometallic reagents (Figure 1).911 However, beyond 
their use as conjunctive linchpins for highly specific multi
component reactions,12,13 olefins have seen limited considera
tion as partners for direct, C(sp3)enriching metallaphotoredox 
couplings. If simpler alkenetoC(sp3)radical activation modes
