Description:
Used as an ambient gas in CVD processes affecting film thickness.

Text:
We 
also note that only very few ALD processes has been 
published for carbides, with TaC6 and WCx7 as notable 
examples. The lack of ALD processes for carbides is to a 
large part explained by the lack of a suitable carbon 
precursor. We recently showed that trimethylboron (B(CH3)3, TMB) 
can function as a single source precursor for CVD of boron
carbon thin films at 7001100 C and 5000 Pa in either a 
hydrogen or an argon ambient.8 We observed that the films 
deposited from TMB at 700 C in a H2 ambient were thinner 
than those deposited in Ar ambient.

Description:
Opens more pathways for the decomposition of TMB.

Text:
This was unexpected as 
the hydrogen ambient opens more pathways for the 
decomposition of TMB.8 In addition, we noted that attempts 
to deposit thicker films by increasing the deposition time 
failed, where three times longer deposition resulted in 
similar film thickness. In this work, we show that the deposition chemistry of 
TMB provides an inherent surface inhibiting effect for CVD 
of BxC films at 700 C and 5000 Pa, i.e. much higher 
temperature and pressure than employed in previous 
inhibited CVD studies, when performed in a hydrogen 
ambient and that this phenomenon can be used to deposit 
conformal boroncarbon films.
