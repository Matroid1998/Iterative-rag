Description:
Noble metal nanoparticles investigated for biomedical applications.

Text:
Noble metal nanoparticles have attracted particular attention. They been investigated
for a number of biomedical applications, such as drug delivery or medical imaging, so
understanding their interaction with proteins is of signicant importance.The eect of
gold nanoparticles and nanoclusters on the formation of amyloid brils has also been
investigated25. This work found a size dependent eect with nanoclusters and small gold
nanoparticles inhibiting brillation while larger ones promote this24. Nanoparticles con
sisting of other noble metals, such as silver or platinum, have also been investigated for
biomedical applications2631. Their aect on brillation behaviour is less clear so it is of in
terest to determine the how dierent metal surfaces interact with amyloidogenic proteins22.
