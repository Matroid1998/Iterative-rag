A compound used to generate a Ni centered excited state crucial for catalysis.

Ir(ppy)3 and a phenoxazine (PhenO) PC; ppy 
 2phenylpyridine and PhenO  3,7di(1,1biphenyl4yl)
10(naphthalen1yl)10Hphenoxazine) to a Ni complex to 
generate a Ni centered excited state that was crucial for catalysis 
(Fig. 1B). Based on these reports, we hypothesized that energy 
transfer would also be the mode of activation of Ni in our 
unified Cheteroatom coupling system as these same PCs are 
used.

Description:
A photocatalyst with an excited state reduction potential of 1.66 V vs SCE.

Text:
However, the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(I) by the excited 
state PC (either Ir(ppy)3 or PhenO; Ered  1.66 and 1.73 V vs 
SCE respectively) is thermodynamically feasible based on 
reported cyclic voltammetry data of relevant nickel bipyridine 
complexes (EredNi(II)Ni(I)  1.01.3 V vs SCE).1112 
Furthermore, in our study with SCF3 nucleophiles, product 
yield was found to increase as the excited state reduction 
potential of the PC became more negative, while the triplet 
energy of the PCs was found to have no correlation with yield. These considerations taken together suggest that the alternate 
hypothesis of an oxidative quenching cycle (Fig. 1D) should be 
considered seriously in these systems, motivating a mechanistic 
study to distinguish between electron transfer and energy 
transfer as the mode of quenching of the Ir(ppy)3 excited state.
