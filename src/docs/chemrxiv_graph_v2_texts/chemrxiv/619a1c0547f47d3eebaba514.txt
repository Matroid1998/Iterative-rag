Converted with H2 into CH4 by the Sabatier reactions.

The PowertoX process is a promising technology to tackle the challenge of the storage of surplus 
fluctuating renewable electricity by converting it into chemical energy. During the PowertoGas (PtG) 
process, H2 is produced from water and renewable electrical energy via electrolysis and subsequently 
converted with the carbon oxides CO or CO2 into CH4 (synthetic natural gas) by the Sabatier reactions 
(Gtz et al., 2016; Rnsch et al., 2016; Kalz et al., 2017). In short and midterm, the most promising 
carbon oxide sources are industrial exhaust gases, such as blastfurnace and converter gas from steel 
industry, gases from cement production or biomass gasification, which potentially consist of COCO2 
(COx) mixtures of variable composition over time (Sutton et al., 2001; Sch et al., 2014; UribeSoto et 
al., 2017).

Description:
A greenhouse gas that can be used to reduce industrial emissions and achieve negative emissions when sourced from ambient air.

Using highly concentrated CO2 from those sources also offers to reduce industrial CO2 
emissions significantly. In perspective, this technology can be applied to achieve negative emissions, 
as well, if CO2 from ambient air is used as reactant (House et al., 2011; Goeppert et al., 2012; Dittmeyer 
et al., 2019). Such point sources for renewable energy and carbon oxides require local PtG plants in 
order to avoid costly transport infrastructure and inefficiencies in distribution (Vogt et al., 2019). This 
also requires plants at a smaller scale tailored to the local availability of the carbon and energy 
resources. Due to economic reasons such small scale plants, though, probably exhibit small buffer 
capacities to dampen fluctuations originating from renewable resources (Vogt et al., 2019; Theurich et 
al., 2020).
