Description:
Products delivered by the double oxidation of phenols by IBX or related iodine(V) reagents in a highly regioselective manner.

Text:
Hypervalent iodine (HVI) compounds represent a class of important and versatile reagents and 
reactants in organic synthesis.1 For example, iodine(V) species, such as 2iodoxybenzoic acid 
(IBX), are recognized as effective oxidants for a wide range of synthetic transformations.2 
More specifically, the double oxidation of phenols by IBX or related iodine(V) reagents 
delivers orthoquinones in a highly regioselective manner.3 However, to date, a notable 
limitation of iodine(V)mediated phenol oxidation chemistry is that these transformations are 
typically restricted to electronrich phenol substrates.
