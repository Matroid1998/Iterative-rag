Description:
Synthetic water-soluble polymers used as emulsifiers and moisture carriers in personal care products and as stabilizers in agricultural formulations.

Text:
Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are a major class of synthetic watersoluble polymers 
(WSPs) with an annual global production volume of approximately 600 kilotons.1 In home and 
personal care products, PEGs act as emulsifiers and moisture carriers.2,3 In these applications, 
PEGs are typically diluted in water and are discarded in household wastewater streams. In 
agricultural formulations, PEGs emulsify and stabilize pesticides and fertilizers, thereby 
ensuring their efficient application.4 A common feature of these applications is that PEGs are 
subject to dissipative release, either to wastewater treatment plants or agricultural soils.
