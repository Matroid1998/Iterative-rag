Description:
An oxidizing agent used for oxidation of Dmoc functions.

Text:
Deprotection and cleavage were achieved in three steps by removing the 2cyanoethyl 
phosphate protecting group with DBU, oxidation of the Dmoc functions with sodium periodate and aniline 
induced elimination. Besides serving as the base for elimination, excess aniline was used as a 
nucleophilic scavenger for the deprotection side product 2hh, which would otherwise react with the
