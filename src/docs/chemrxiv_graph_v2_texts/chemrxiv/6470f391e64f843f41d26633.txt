Description:
A compound that undergoes hydrolysis to produce 2ethylhexanol.

Hydrolysis has been identified as a potentially important indoor chemistry process, responsible 
for secondary emissions of several notable indoor pollutants.1 In the context of indoor 
environment, it was first speculated as a source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in studies 
observing the effect of relative humidity on VOC emission from building products in the 1990s.2,3 
Since then, the discussion on hydrolysis in indoor air has gained attention due to its association 
with 2ethylhexanol, the hydrolysis product of bis(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and bis(2
ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA).
