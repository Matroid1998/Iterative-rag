Description:
Involved in heterolytic HH bond cleavage in FLP reactions.

Text:
The role of frustration in the mechanistic proposal by Papai et al. in ref. 4a for reaction 
41 
of an FLP with dihydrogen. Ef represents the energy of frustration that lowers the barrier to 
42 
FLPs reactivity (in this case to heterolytic HH bond cleavage). 43
