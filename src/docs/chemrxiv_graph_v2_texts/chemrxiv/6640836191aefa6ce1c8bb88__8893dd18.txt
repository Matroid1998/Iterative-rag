Description:
Forms more active flat nanoparticles when stabilized by Lewis basic sites.

demonstrated that the activity of this catalyst could be enhanced significantly by a strongly 
reductive treatment in the reaction gas mixture 9. The authors explained this by the formation 
of Lewis basic sites on the support, which could stabilize more active flat Ru nanoparticles 
(NPs), resulting in strong metalsupport interactions (MSIs). While the performance and activity of supported Ru catalysts in the CO2 hydrogenation 
reactions 1016 and on mechanistic aspects of these reactions 8, 1722 were investigated 
in numerous studies, the interaction of CO2 with these catalysts under different reaction 
conditions has received much less attention so far, in spite of its crucial importance for these 
reactions.
