Description:
A large ion that can travel through the channels of zeolites.

Text:
Due to their structure, zeolites have channels, through which water and 
large ions (such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium) can travel into and out of the crystal 
structure (Strekeisen, 2020); the size of molecules or ions is controlled by size of channels, and 
zeolites can act as a chemical sieve. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these 
materials the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This 
is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions (Strekeisen, 2020). In RRUFF database, we find the members of the natrolite group as natrolite, mesolite, scolecite, and 
gonnardite. In this database, Raman spectra are provided, where we can easily observe the OH
stretching region of water.
