Description:
Produced on the cathode during CO2RR, including saturated and nonsaturated types.

Text:
In aqueous 
reaction environments, oxygen (O2) is the only product that forms on the anode side regardless of 
the anode material used. However, a variety of CO2RR products can be produced on the cathode, 
including but not limited to carbon monoxide (CO),49 saturated4, 1012 and nonsaturated 
hydrocarbons,11, 1317 and, alcohols with various chain lengths and energy densities (e.g., 
methanol,12, 1820 ethanol,16, 2123 and npropanol24). Formate is another commodity chemical of 
high value.2526 As recently noted by Chen et al.,26 it is the liquid nature of the formateformic 
acid product that enables the downstream product separation following primary electrolysis to be 
conducted with less effort, thus enhancing the profitability of the overall production process. Existing and potential future applications of formateformic acid concern formic acid fuel
