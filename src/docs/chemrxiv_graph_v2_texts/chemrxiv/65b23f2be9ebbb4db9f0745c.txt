Description:
Materials with desirable optoelectronic properties used as potential solar absorbers.

Text:
The multifunctionality of these materials has made them 
a suitable platform for property tuning to suit a variety of applications, including 
photocatalysis15 and Xray detection.16 In particular, they have gained attention as 
potential solar absorbers, with the aim of using a split anion approach17 to combine the 
desirable optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) with the enhanced 
stability of chalcogenidebased materials.18,19 The opportunities for wider compositional 
and structural exploration through employing the mixed anion chemistry of chalcohalide 
materials makes them a valuable starting point for this task.20 Several mixedmetal
