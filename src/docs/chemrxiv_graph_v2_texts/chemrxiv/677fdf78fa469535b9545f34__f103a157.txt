Description:
Prone to contaminants and defects when surface termination methods lack atomic-level precision.

Recently, minimally intensive layer delamination (MILD) is the most prevalent and highoutput 
acid etching method for Ti3C2Tx synthesis.14,15 However, Ti3C2Tx produced by the MILD method typically 
contains numerous F terminations due to the LiF precursor, which is detrimental to electrical conductivity. Therefore, posttreatment following MILD to engineer surface chemistry with desired termination groups 
is imperative to enhance the performance of lightdriven TMC soft robotics.1618 Common surface 
termination tailoring methods include heat treatment, solvothermal treatment, and chemical grafting. However, these methods often lack atomiclevel processing precision, uniformity, and scalability for 
prospective industrial workflows, and are prone to introducing contaminants and defects into the intrinsic 
Ti3C2 structure.1921 
Plasma treatment has been demonstrated to effectively alter surface functional groups with high atomic 
precision.
