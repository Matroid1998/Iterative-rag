Description:
The remaining structure after pyrolysis, often referred to as char, is almost pure carbon.

However, the process parameters 
used to manufacture this material, which plays a critical role in the resulting morphology and the final 
properties of the material, have proven difficult to optimize in a systematic manner. GC properties are heavily influenced by the chemistry of the precursor polymer 6. During the 
pyrolysis process, at elevated temperatures and in an inert atmosphere, most of the heteroatoms are removed 
in the form of volatiles. The remaining structure is almost pure carbon and is often referred to as char. The 
characteristics of this evolving structure are highly dependent on the processing conditions and precursor
