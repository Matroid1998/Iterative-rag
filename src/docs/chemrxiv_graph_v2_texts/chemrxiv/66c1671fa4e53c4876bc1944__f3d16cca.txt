Colloidal nanocrystals synthesized in solution phase.

have used a topdown 
approach to nanocrystal preparation and were able to apply the 
resulting materials in solutionprocessed fieldeffect transistor 
devices.36 However, until recently, solutionphase syntheses of 
colloidal BaZrS3 nanocrystals were unknown, possibly due in 
part to the difficulties associated with preparing chalcogenide 
compounds of highly oxophilic early transition metal cations.37 
We recently reported the successful solutionphase synthesis of
