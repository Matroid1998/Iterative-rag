Description:
Studied as a function of relative permittivity of solvents.

Text:
With a motive to shed some light into the fundamental understanding of SIS, recently, SIS as 
a function of relative permittivitys () of solvents was studied in alanine dipeptides 9, 
pyridinium iodide 21, and in the nitrogens of 1methylazoles 7. It has also been reported 
that SIS of pyridinium ring protons decrease linearly with the increase in solvent polarity 21. Recently, SIS due to its experimental simplicity, has also been used to measure water content 
in organic solvents 22 and resolve crowded 1H NMR signals of drug molecules 23, where
