Description:
A reactant in Passerini polymerization with carboxylic acids and isonitriles.

Text:
Representative examples include the one
step Passerini polymerization of aldehyde, carboxylic and isonitrile;7,8 the A3coupling 
polymerization of alkynes, aldehydes, and amines;9 the Biginelli polymerization of aryl aldehyde, 
keto ester, and urea (thiourea);10,11 and the Cucatalyzed MCP of alkynes, sulfonyl azides with 
various nucleophiles.1216 On the other hand, the multistep MCP is also known as multicomponent 
tandem (or cascade) polymerization, in which different monomers and catalysts are added in multi
steps and reacted in a sequential period.17 Representative examples are Sonogashira polycouplings 
of alkynes and carbonyl chlorides, followed by a subsequent reaction with nucleophiles such as 
thiols,18,19 amines20,21 , amino ester salts22 and indoline derivatives.23 Multicomponent
