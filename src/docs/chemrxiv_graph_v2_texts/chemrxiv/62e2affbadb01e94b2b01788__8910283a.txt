Description:
A C1 compound produced during the electroreduction of CO2 by Cu.

New discoveries of improved catalysts, guided by a detailed understanding of structureactivity 
relationships, are needed in order to progress toward these targets. The selectivity of CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) is strongly dependent on the nature of the catalyst. Among the 
single metals which show CO2ER activity10, In and Sn are mainly HCOO producers, while Cu shows a unique 
ability to reduce CO2 into a wide range of products including C1 compounds (CO, HCOO and CH4) and C2 
hydrocarbons (C2H4, C2H5OH, and others), typically as an undesirable mixture. 6, 11 A variety of approaches, 
including surface nanostructuring1214, and tuning the electronic structure by modifying with a second metal, 
have been introduced to direct the selectivity of Cu towards a specific product.
