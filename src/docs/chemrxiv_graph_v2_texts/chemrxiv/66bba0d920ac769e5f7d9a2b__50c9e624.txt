Description:
Polymers with tertiary amide repeating units, synthesized by cationic ring opening polymerization.

In aqueous polymer 
solutions, the LCST phase transition is primarily driven by entropy loss related to hydrogen 
bonding interactions.1 Entropy loss becomes dominant upon heating, results in the dehydration 
of the polymer and phase separation1,2 LCST behavior can be tuned by modifying the hydrophilic 
character of the polymers through copolymerization with hydrophilic or hydrophobic comonomers 
or through endgroup modifications.35 
Poly(2oxazoline)s (POx) are polymers with tertiary amide repeating units, synthesized by cationic 
ring opening polymerization.6,7 This synthetic polymer family has recently received increased 
attention, as they have been found to have a wide scope of potential applications, including 
surface coatings,8,9 indirect food additives,10,11 drug delivery systems,1214 and hydrogels.1520 
Recently, a POxbased polymerdrug conjugate successfully completed phase I clinical trials,21 
and a POxbased hemostatic patch was approved for clinical use.22,23 The water solubility of POx 
homopolymers mainly depends on the length of the alkyl groups of the sidechain.
