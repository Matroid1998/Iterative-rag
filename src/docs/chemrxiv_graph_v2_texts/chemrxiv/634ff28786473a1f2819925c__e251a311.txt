In this 
context, chiral Ln(III)based complexes have been used as highly 
efficient CPL emitters for applications in biological sensing, anti
counterfeiting devices, organic lightemitting diodes.10,2024 In 
addition, a 1D organization can have a great influence on the 
magnetic anisotropy of the system and thus on the resulting 
macroscopic magnetic properties.25,26 
Among chiral molecular building blocks, helicenes have 
recently raised great attention.
