Description:
Used in twisted biphenyl emitters where there is mixing of donor p and acceptor p orbitals resulting in significant SOC.

Simultaneously, nonradiative decay needs to be sufficiently suppressed such that formally spin
forbidden phosphorescence can become the major decay pathways.23, 24 ISC can occur between higher
lying excited states, as advanced by Wu et al.25 in twisted biphenyl emitters where there is mixing of 
donor p and acceptor p orbitals that result in significant SOC. Crystallization,2630 clustering,3134 matrix rigidification,3540 deuteration,41, 42 and polymerization43
48 strategies have each been employed to suppress molecular motion that is a primary conduit for non
radiative decay. For example, Bolton et al. achieved highefficiency RTP with a phosphorescence 
quantum yield (FPh) of 55 via crystallization of brominated aromatic compounds.26 In a similar vein, 
Hamzehpoor et al.
