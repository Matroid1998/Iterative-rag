Cu is used as the interconnect metal in CMOS devices, but is facing into significant challenges in its 
continued use in highspeed ultralarge scale integrated circuits. A diffusion barrier and liner layer are 
needed for Cu deposition to ensure that it remains conducting but there are significant challenges in Cu 
deposition in highaspect ratio structures of vias and trenches.14 As device dimensions shrink and more 
complex structures emerge, the volume available for copper interconnect at the transistor levels becomes 
correspondingly smaller and must still accommodate the barrier, the liner and copper. One solution to 
these critical issues is to replace copper with alternative metals with low resistivity at the nanoscale that 
suffer less from these challenges.
