Description:
Species whose binding energies correlate linearly with the binding energies of N atoms on various surfaces.

Text:
For instance, Pallassana and
Neurock (2000) demonstrated linear relationships between activa
tion energies and reaction energies, as well as between activation
energies and binding energies in CH bond breaking.5 Further work
by Nrskov et al. (2002) revealed a universal linear trend between
binding energies and activation energies for several types of disso
ciation reactions.6
A second class of linear relationships was proposed by Abild
Pedersen et al. (2007), who showed that the binding energies of
CHx, NHx, OHx, and SHx species on various closedpacked and
stepped surfaces correlate linearly with the corresponding binding
energies of C, N, O, and S atoms, respectively.7 A similar analy
