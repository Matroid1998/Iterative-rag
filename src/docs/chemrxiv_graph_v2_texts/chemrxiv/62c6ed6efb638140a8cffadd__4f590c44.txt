Description:
Undergoes oxidation leading to the formation of disulfide bonds, a posttranslational modification.

Text:
The oxidation of Cys leading to the formation of the
disulde bond is a well known posttranslational mod
ication in biochemistry. Such bridges play a pivotal
role in protein folding, regulation and stability.13 How
ever, recently a new covalent crosslink other than the
disulde bond was reported.4 The newly characterized
crosslink is established between Cys and Lys residues
which are shown to be linked through an O atom.

Description:
A residue that can be oxidized and recovered under reducing conditions.

Text:
The
bond was coined as the NOS bond and it was later on
shown to take place in a wide variety of proteins, with
wide ranging implications for regulation and catalytic
mechanisms.5 It is remarkable that this bond is formed
upon oxidizing conditions and that the reduced Cys and
Lys residues can be fully recovered under the action of
reducing agents. The formation of such a crosslink requires the ox
idation of both Cys and Lys residues.
