Description:
An oxidized phase involved in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.

Text:
Even though it is not yet clear which oxidized NiOOH phase is the more 
beneficial for the OER activity, it has been established that the presence of iron 
promotes the OER performance of the Nibearing electrodes in a plethora of Ni
bearing electrode systems711. Recently, a very simple method for preparing Fe
coated electrodes was reported, which involves the immersion of the Nibearing 
electrode in an Febearing solution4. Insitu spectroelectrochemistry has proven to be an efficient tool for 
understanding the reaction mechanisms during operando conditions3,12,13. In the 
majority of Nibearing samples, however, such measurements are possible on 
samples grown on suitable substrates (usually not nickel), which in turn may 
perplex the interpretation of the obtained results.
