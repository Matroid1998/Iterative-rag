Description:
A one-atom-thick layer of carbon packed in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with impressive mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.

Text:
Graphene is a oneatomthick layer of carbon packed in a twodimensional honeycomb lattice, serving as the basis
for arguably one of the most radical materials of the last decade thanks to its extremely impressive mechanical,
electrical, and thermal properties. 28 Graphene was referred to as the wonder material and commanded an
unusual amount of interest since its first isolation in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, using
mechanical exfoliationmore popularly, the Scotch tape method. Very soon, in 2010, both scientists earned
the Nobel Prize in Physics. This discovery singled out intensive research into numerous promising directions
relating to graphene electronics, energy storage, and materials science. 12.

Description:
Exhibits high electron mobility, exceptional tensile strength, and excellent thermal conductivity.

Text:
Unlike its parent material, graphite, which consists of stacked layers of graphene, monolayer graphene
exhibits superior properties such as high electron mobility, exceptional tensile strength, and excellent thermal
conductivity. These characteristics make graphene a promising candidate for various advanced technologies. However, challenges remain regarding the scalable and costeffective production of highquality graphene, leading
to the development of several synthesis methods such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and electrochemical
exfoliation 38. 2
