Description:
A material used in membranes that selectively adsorbs gases, requiring regeneration or replacement when saturated.

Approaches to overcome the crosssensitivity of a sensor include (1, materials engineering) tune
the chemistry of its recognition element to enhance its selectivity for the analyte; (2, sensor
array) include additional sensors harboring dierent recognition elements, to construct a sensor
array 22 whose response pattern provides more information about the gas; (3, preltering)
lter the gas before it is exposed to the sensor, to prevent the interferent from reaching and
interacting with its recognition element. Approach (1) is most fundamentally dicult. Approach
(2) necessitates machine learning algorithms to interpret the response pattern 23. In approach
(3), a lter that selectively (physi or chemi)adsorbs the interferent 2429such as a zeolite
membrane 27will eventually saturate with gas and thus require regeneration or replacement
20.
