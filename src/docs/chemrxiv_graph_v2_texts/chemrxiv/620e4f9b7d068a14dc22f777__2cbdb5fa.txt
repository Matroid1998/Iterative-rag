Description:
Acts as a ligand in hydroxylases, replaced by a nonpolar residue in halogenases.

Text:
Hydroxylases bind iron via a 2 His1 Carboxyl (AspGlu) 
facial triad analogous to halogenases except that in halogenases the carboxyl ligand is replaced 
by a nonpolar Ala or Gly residue.1,4 This amino acid substitution in halogenases enables the 
steric and electrostatic accommodation of an iron coordinated halide anion that is essential for 
halogenation reactivity.5 Both hydroxylases and halogenases have been suggested to operate via 
a similar catalytic mechanism (Fig S1).6,7 Once 2OG, iron, and substrate are bound to the 
enzyme, a conformational change is triggered that facilitates molecular oxygen binding to the 
iron center. Next, oxidative decarboxylation of the 2OG cosubstrate results in the cleavage of 
oxygens OO bond and the formation of a highvalent ferryl intermediate (FeIVO).
