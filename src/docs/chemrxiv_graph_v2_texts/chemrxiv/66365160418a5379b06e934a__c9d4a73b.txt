Description:
A lipophilic cAMP derivative that penetrates the cell membrane and mimics cAMP.

Text:
One commonly used and commercially available13 cAMP 
derivative is 8(4chlorophenylthio)cAMP (8CPTcAMP), which 
is lipophilic enough to penetrate the cell membrane.14 Inside the 
cell, it mimics cAMP, triggers the PKA, and activates the cAMP
related signaling pathway.14 Adding this cAMP derivative to the 
culture medium is typically sufficient to induce the signaling 
cascade, but this method has significant drawbacks. Firstly, 
adding the 8CPTcAMP to the bulk prevents precise spatial 
targeting of individual cells or cell clusters in a tissuelike cell 
culture model. Secondly, activation of the signaling cascade is 
permanent unless the substance is hydrolyzed or manually 
washed out from the cells under study.
