Description:
Stored in MoS2 through electrochemical intercalation and conversion reactions.

Text:
In the field of electrochemical energy storage, MoS2 has been employed as an anode material 
suitable for lithium and sodium ion storage, with the possibility to store charge via 
electrochemical intercalation andor conversion reactions, depending on the utilized voltage 
window912. When used as an intercalation host, it was found that kinetically favorable 
intercalation properties are obtained when MoS2 crystallite size is reduced13. For such 
nanosized MoS2, Cook et al. report the emergence of solidsolution intercalation with 
pseudocapacitive properties, that is, Faradaic charge storage with a capacitorlike signature 
over a wide voltage range in absence of kinetic diffusion limitations13, 14. It was also found 
that the introduction of crystal defects, as well as the increase of the MoS2 dspacing via 
hexanediamine pillars amplifies the pseudocapacitive electrochemical lithiation response15, 
16.
