Description:
Used in models to predict the evolution of aggregate populations in polymerization studies.

1,3,5benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs)25 or phenylenevinylenes.26 Such models can predict
31
the evolution of the aggregate population, resulting in polymerisation curves that are validated by tting the signals detected in
32
experiments based on hypotetical polymerization schemes.2729 At atomistic resolution, rstprinciples molecular dynamics
33
(MD) simulations were recently demonstrated useful for the study of supramolecular polymers.16,3034 Coarsegrained
34
MD (CGMD) simulations have been also employed to study complex supramolecular polymer systems, reaching relevant
35
space and timescales for the study of their dynamics.3543 In particular, combined with enhanced sampling methods, such
36
models allow to study the molecular exchange between the supramolecular structures and their surroundings,21,31,4447 the

exchange pathways,48 and the response of these materials to external stimuli.49,50 Such advanced computational approaches
