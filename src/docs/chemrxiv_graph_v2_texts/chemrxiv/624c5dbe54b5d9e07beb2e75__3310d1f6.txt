Description:
A boron-based catalyst that releases more than 2 equivalents of H2 per equivalent of AB at 60Â°C.

Text:
reported that a metal 
free boron based 9,10dichlorodiboraanthracene (bisborane) (1ClCl) 
catalyst releases more than 2 equivalents of H2 per equivalent of AB 
at 60 0C in the presence of 14 mixture of THFdiglyme (Dg) solvent 
(Scheme 1).16 The high efficiency involved in the catalytic AB 
dehydrogenation process may be attributed to the high Lewis acidity 
of the two boron centres attached with electronegative Cl atoms which 
promotes BH activation of the AB system. Incidentally, the presence 
of two Lewis acidic sites and a definite geometry of bidentate boron 
based Lewis acid catalyst make it distinct from the other monoboron 
based Lewis acids in terms of high catalytic activity.
