Description:
A magnetic Weyl semimetal.

The d orbitals of transition
metals may break these limitations just as transition metal
dimers have a higher maximum bond multiplicity than main
group dimers. A balance of electronic effects control the
properties of transition metal compounds  covalent, ionic,
relativistic  which make them exciting but underexplored
candidates for topological materials. 9,15,16 Examples exist
from various classes of topological materials, such as the
magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2
17 and the topological
insulator Na2IrO3, 18,19 so there is a pressing need to study
the ways in which d orbital interactions can create topolog
ical states. In this study we will examine features of transition metal
bonds that lead to topological bands in the Zintl phase
SrAg4Sb2, shown in Figure 1.
