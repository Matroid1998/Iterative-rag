Description:
The only material that can uniquely convert CO2 into valuable multi-carbon products (C2) in appreciable quantities.

Text:
Among the different catalysts 
studied, copper (Cu) is known as the only material that can uniquely convert CO2 into valuable multi
carbon products (C2) in appreciable quantities.46 Unfortunately, despite much progress in recent years, 
the poor conversion efficiency, limited control of product distribution, and low stability of Cubased 
electrocatalysts limit largescale application of CO2R.78
