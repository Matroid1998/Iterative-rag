Description:
Possesses excellent electrochemical stability and resistance towards dendrite formation, suitable for small scale devices or as a protective layer in lithium battery cells.

LiPON,
for example, possesses excellent electrochemical stabil
ity and resistance towards dendrite formation23, yet
poormediocre conductivities of the order of 106S cm1
are typically observed21), making it suitable for small
scale devices or as a protective layer in conventional
lithium battery cells.24 Whilst a lower conductivity
would intuitively be expected in the solid state com
pared to the liquid state, competitively high conductiv
ities ( 103 S cm3) are observed for some solid state
materials.25 However, some expected issues do arise with
respect to stability and synthesis of these materials.8
Within the past decade, Lirich antiperovskites, such as
Li3OCl have gained a lot of interest due to their ini
tial high reported ionic conductivities at ambient condi
tions (103 S cm1) as reported by Zhao and Daemen26.
