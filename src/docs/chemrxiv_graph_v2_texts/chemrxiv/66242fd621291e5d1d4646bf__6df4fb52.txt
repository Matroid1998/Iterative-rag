Description:
A moiety present in natural products, pharmaceuticals, organic materials, and catalysts.

Text:
The omnipresence of the pyridine moiety in natural products, phar
maceuticals, organic materials, and catalysts accentuates its privi
leged character; examples relevant to this work are shown in Figure 
1A.1,2,3,4,5,6 Given this importance, many metalcatalyzed pathways,7 
such as CH activation,8 rearrangement,9 ringexpansion,10 multi
component reactions,11 and molecular editing approaches12 have 
been developed for its synthesis.

Description:
Synthesized through intermolecular transition metal-catalyzed cycloadditions of nitriles and alkynes.

Text:
Intermolecular transition metalcatalyzed cycloadditions between ni
triles and alkynes also represent a straightforward but less explored 
atomeconomical approach for synthesizing multisubstituted pyri
dines (Figure 1B).23 However, following this strategy, only the cou
pling of two identical alkynes is possible. To the best of our 
knowledge, the intermolecular coupling between two different al
kynes and a nitrile was only accomplished in a stepwise fashion using 
stoichiometric amounts of Cp2ZrEt2 and NiCl2(PPh3)2 by Takahasi 
and coworkers24a or using titanium alkoxide by Sato and cowork
ers.24b 
Thus, a catalytic strategy to realize a threecomponent crossannula
tion of two different alkynes with nitriles would consist of a valuable 
expansion of the current state of the art, allowing the synthesis of di
verse pyridine scaffolds.

Description:
A compound that can be synthesized through photocatalytic cyclization of aromatic alkynes with nitriles.

Text:
Recent discoveries and upsurge of research in the photo and elec
trochemistry domain offer an alternative to classical metalmediated 
reaction conditions to construct pyridine rings. Wang, Meng, and 
coworkers reported a photocatalytic 222 cyclization of 
aromatic alkynes with nitriles for the synthesis of 2,3,6
trisubstituted pyridines using a pyrylium salt as the photoredox 
catalyst (Figure 1C)25 that was able to overcome the high oxidation 
potentials of alkynes being the major challenge in this type of 
transformation. Electrochemistry has the advantage of employing 
electrons as traceless redox reagents for activating common and inert 
organic molecules, particularly alkynes,26 for generating highly reac
tive intermediates.
