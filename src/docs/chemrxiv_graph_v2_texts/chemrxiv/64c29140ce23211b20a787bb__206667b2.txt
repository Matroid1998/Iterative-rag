Description:
An n-type post-transition metal oxide, often doped with fluorine, used as a transparent conducting material with high electron conductivity and optical transmission.

Materials that display the dual properties of optical transparency and
metalliclike conductivity are sparse, but they are almost universally required in modern
technologies13 as transparent contacts in solar cells;4 thin film transistors in display and
touchscreen technology;5,6 coatings in smart and lowemission windows.7 The transparent
conducting materials (TCMs) used in the above applications are invariably ntype post
transition metal oxides (such as Sndoped In2O3, Fdoped SnO2 and Aldoped ZnO), which
routinely display electron conductivity on the order of 1000 S cm1 to 10 000 S cm1 and op
tical transmission above 90.5 Meanwhile, the development of ptype TCMs has been less
successful  hole conductivity is often 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower, optical transparency
is much harder to achieve, and the chemical and thermal stability of ptype TCMs is often
poorer than the ntype metal oxides.2,3 This disparity between p and ntype TCM tech
nology is a major bottleneck in the development of the next generation of optoelectronic
devices, which will have at their heart fully transparent pn junctions.
