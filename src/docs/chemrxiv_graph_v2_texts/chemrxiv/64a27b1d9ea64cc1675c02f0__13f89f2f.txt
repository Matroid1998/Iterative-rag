Description:
A crosslinker used in the fabrication of PEDOTPSS films.

Text:
Various types of 
crosslinkers have been proposed for PEDOTPSS, such as (3
glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS),20,21 divinyl sulfone (DVS),22,23 and 
polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDE).2426 To simplify the fabrication process, 
these crosslinkers are often added to the filmforming inks before processing. We previously
