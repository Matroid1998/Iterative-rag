Description:
Reacts readily with oxidation-induced reactive species, leading to aroma loss.

reported that red wines enriched with oxygen from air (5.56.5 
31 
mgL dissolved O2) exhibited fast initial consumption rate of O2 (averaged as 3.82 mgL in the first day of 
32 
oxidation).7 A high initial consumption rate of O2 was similarly observed by the same group in white and rose 
33 
wines, with copper, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamic acids shown to be the determining factors of the O2 
34 
consumption rate.8 Such findings were corroborated more recently by Kontoudakis and Clark, in that copper can 
35 
drastically increase the rate of oxygen uptake in aerated wine within a short time frame.9 
36 
Additionally from the aroma perspective, Nikolantonaki and Waterhouse have reported that the firstorder 
37 
reaction constant  between 4methyl1,2benzoquinone (a model quinone) and an important varietal thiol, 3
38 
mercaptohexanol (3MH), is 0.0578 s1, corresponding to the halflife of 3MH in this reaction as 12.0 s (calculated 
39 
as 
ln 2
).10 Although in reality the rate of quinonethiol reactions would be governed by other external factors such 
40 
as the presence of antioxidants, varietal thiols react readily with oxidationinduced reactive species, which 
41 
subsequently leads to aroma loss.
