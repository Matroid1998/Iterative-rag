Description:
A target for reduction by ReI and MnI-based catalysts.

Text:
Due to their electrondeficiency perylene monoimide (PMI) and perylene diimides (PDI) often 
serve as sensitizers in oxidative catalysis.810 However, a few reports exist focussing on the use of rylene 
chromophores in intramolecular dyads for lightdriven reduction reactions. For instance, Wasielewski 
et al.11,12 studied the impact of PMI and PDI as well as naphthaleneimide chromophores coupled to 
ReI and MnIbased carbon dioxide reduction catalysts.
