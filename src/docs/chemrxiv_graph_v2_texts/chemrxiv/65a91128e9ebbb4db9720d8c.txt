Description:
Microporous crystalline materials synthesized with organic additives that act as structure directing agents.

Text:
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that are frequently synthesized with the aid of organic
additives that act as organic structure directing agents, OSDAs, and are finally retained in the as
synthesized materials, rendering them nonporous unless these organics are removed. The removal
of those organic molecules to open the micropores is generally attained by calcination in air at
relatively high temperatures, typically above 400 or 500 C. This is obviously energetically costly
and economically expensive and may cause structural damage and the extraction of certain
heteroatoms (atoms other than Si) from the framework.

Description:
Materials from which organics can be removed through milder treatments, depending on their pore system.

Text:
In the case of zeolite membranes,
calcination may introduce cracks that compromise their separation performance and mechanical
properties.1 Thus, there is a significant interest in developing routes for the removal of organics
from zeolites through milder treatments.2 The effectiveness of such methods depends on the pore
system and on the nature of the OSDA.
