Description:
Has a high threshold energy of sputtering, around 150-200 eV, which helps minimize wall erosion in fusion reactors.

Tungsten is a prime candidate for plasmafacing components (PFCs) in fusion reactors. Being a 
refractory metal, W exhibits exceptional hightemperature properties, making it an attractive 
material for components exposed to the extreme conditions of fusion plasma 13. Of all metallic 
elements, W has the highest melting point (3422 ), and at elevated temperatures, it exhibits the 
highest tensile strength among metals 45. Additionally, W shows exceptional corrosion 
resistance and is highly resistant to attacks by mineral acids. An important advantage of W is its 
high threshold energy of sputtering, around 150200 eV for Deuterium (D) 67, which helps 
minimize wall erosion. However, erosion could also occur due to unavoidable impurities, which 
reduce the threshold value of the D sputtering energy 8.
