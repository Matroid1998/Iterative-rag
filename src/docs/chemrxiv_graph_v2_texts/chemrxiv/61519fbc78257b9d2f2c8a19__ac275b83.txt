Description:
Used in metal cation metathesis with linkers having carboxylic acid coordination sites.

Text:
Their porous nature favors processes of inclusion 
and exchange of guests (e.g., solvent, molecular guest, and 
metal ions) in the inner cavities by physical trapping, coor
dinative interactions with the metal nodes, or pending 
moieties.1723 Moreover, dynamic variations of MOF struc
tures were demonstrated upon exposure to external stim
uli2426 and by replacing the constitutive building blocks.27
31 The latter process involves a fine balance between flexi
bility and stability of the overall framework. Metal cation 
metathesis has been mainly demonstrated using a combi
nation of transition metals and linkers having carboxylic 
acid coordination sites.28,3235 Such linkers are classified as 
hard ligands;36 they often exhibit planar structures and two 
or three carboxylic acid groups. For example, Dinc et al.
