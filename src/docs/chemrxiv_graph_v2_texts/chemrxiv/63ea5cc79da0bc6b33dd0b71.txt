Description:
An element used as a cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries, participating in redox reactions.

Text:
Lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries are among the most promising nextgeneration energy storage
systems that have the potential to surpass traditional lithiumion batteries in terms of both
energy density and cost.13 These batteries are composed of a lithium anode and a sulfur
cathode and operate through a redox reaction in which lithium ions are transferred between
the two electrodes.

Description:
An element with insulating nature that poses challenges in lithium-sulfur battery performance.

Text:
This reaction allows lithiumsulfur batteries to store more energy per
unit weight than lithiumion batteries, making them an attractive option for a wide range of
applications.4,5 However, despite their potential advantages, LiS batteries have faced several
challenges in terms of their performance and stability, such as the insulating nature of the
elemental sulfur6 and the shuttle effect of dissolvable lithium polysulfides.7
Conjugated polymers is a class of polymeric materials that exhibits alternating single and
double bonds in their main chain, which gives them unique electrical, optical, and mechanical
properties.811 In the context of LiS batteries, conjugated polymers can be used as cathode
material to improve the electrical conductivity of the sulfur cathode and to prevent the dis
solution of the active materials by forming strong chemical bonds with sulfur.1218 Among
these, thiolcontaining polymers are one example where the SH groups can be crosslinked
with sulfur via covalent bonding.1921
In a recent study, we presented a new fabrication strategy to construct a binder and carbon
additivefree organosulfur cathode based on a thiolcontaining conducting polymer poly(4
(thiophene3yl)benzenethiol) (PTBT).21 The PTBT features the polythiophene main chain
as a highly conducting framework and the benzenethiol side chain to copolymerize22,23 with
sulfur and form a crosslinked organosulfur polymer.

Species that have a significant fixing effect in operando X-ray imaging.

Text:
We have been able to show the sig
nificant fixing effect of sulfur species by operando Xray imaging. This synthesis approach
maintains the conductivity and flexibility of the polymer framework and therefore seems
promising to overcome typical drawbacks of LiS batteries. In a further study, we used a
combination of firstprinciples computational methods and statistical mechanics to explore
the structural characteristics of the initial state of a vulcanized PTBT polymer.24 Our calcu
