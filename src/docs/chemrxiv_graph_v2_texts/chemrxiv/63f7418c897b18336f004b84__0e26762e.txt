Description:
A hybrid ferroelectric material that crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric monoclinic space group Cc at low temperature.

In this article, we focus on the hybrid ferroelectric material,
TMCMCdCl3 (TMCM  trimethylchloromethyl ammonium,
Me3NCH2Cl) with piezoelectric performance comparable to
BaTiO3 in its pure form,9 and to PZT for its solidsolution
with the fluorine analogue of the molecular cation (TMFM
 trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium).11 TMCMCdCl3 crys
tallises in the noncentrosymmetric monoclinic space group
Cc at low temperature with ordered molecular cations, and
transitions to a disordered paraelectric phase in the centrosym
metric hexagonal space group P63mmc above 400 K (Fig. 1).9,11
