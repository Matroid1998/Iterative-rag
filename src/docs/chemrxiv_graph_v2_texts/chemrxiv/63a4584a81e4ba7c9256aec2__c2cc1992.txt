Description:
Compounds produced industrially as liquid fuels and lubricants through processes like the FT process.

Text:
Under certain geopolitical 
conditions, the cost of fuel production through the FT process is economically competitive with 
the crude oil fossilfuel source.3 Examples include Qatar and South Africa, where Pearl GTL 
and SASOL factories produce liquid hydrocarbons and lubricants industrially. CO  H2O  H2  CO2
