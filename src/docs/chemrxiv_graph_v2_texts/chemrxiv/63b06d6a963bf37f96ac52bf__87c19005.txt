Description:
A surfactant used to occupy the SWCNT surface and remove noncovalently bound DNA.

Text:
Surface adsorbed DNA was removed from the SWCNTs in a second 
step by washing with the surfactant sodium cholate (SC), which occupies the SWCNT surface and 
removes noncovalently bound DNA43,44. For PBS washing steps, the amount of removable DNA 
decreased with increasing defect density. For washing with SC no significant difference was 
visible for different defect densities (Figure S1). Therefore, for GdSWCNTs more DNA
molecules are strongly bound than for pristine SWCNTs. To test the influence of the covalent 
character of surface functionalization on analyte recognition, 100 M dopamine (DA) or riboflavin 
were added to GdSWCNTs of different defect densities (Figure 1 c, d, S2). To compare defect 
densities between sensors, the position of the E11 peak was compared.
