Description:
A promising energy carrier that yields only water as a chemical byproduct when used in fuel cells or combustion.

In todays world, where environmental concerns are growing and human impact on climate change is 
undeniable, shifting from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has become not just a 
preference but an essential need.1,2 Exploring efficient and sustainable approaches to store and transport 
environmentally benign fuel sources is becoming crucial. We now face the reality that our historical 
reliance on hydrocarbons extracted from below the ground is unsustainable and ecologically harmful. In 
turn, hydrogen, with its energy stored in HH bonds, is a promising energy carrier since its use in either 
fuel cells or even combustion is itself harmless to the environment, yielding only water as a chemical 
byproduct.

Requires extremely high pressures or very low cryogenic temperatures for liquefaction and storage.

As a specific example involving an economically vital application, adapting heavyduty 
transport to run on hydrogen fuel is an attractive, ecofriendly solution.3,4 
However, moving towards a hydrogenbased economy brings several challenges. Physicalbased 
storage of hydrogen typically requires either extremely high pressures (350700 bar) or very low, cryogenic 
temperatures for hydrogen liquefaction (252.8 C at 1 atm).58 These processes consume a lot of energy, 
both for compressing the hydrogen and maintaining low temperatures.9a Additionally, storing highly 
flammable gas under more than 350 bar pressure raises risk concerns, especially in the context of daily 
transportation, while boil off from liquid hydrogen can lead to significant losses for longer periods of 
storage.9b,9c 
A promising approach for hydrogen storage at moderate pressures is through the use of adsorbents.

Description:
A gas whose gravimetric uptake increases with greater surface area but volumetric uptake decreases, important for hydrogen-fueled transportation.

Furthermore, 
theory could offer insights into the electronic structure of the material, providing further pathways for 
subsequent optimizations.14 
Although MOFs are wellknown for their porosity, the strategy for optimizing a MOF for hydrogen 
storage must go beyond merely increasing its surface area.13 While it is true that the gravimetric uptake 
of hydrogen increases with greater surface area, the volumetric uptake, crucially important for hydrogen
fueled transportation, decreases.15,16 In addition, relying solely on weak physisorption, characterized by 
binding enthalpies around 5 kJmol, is inadequate for attaining substantial usable capacities at room 
temperature and results in unsatisfactorily low hydrogen densities.
