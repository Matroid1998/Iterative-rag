Description:
Favors presence at higher temperatures during phosphorolysis reactions.

Text:
Consequently, the 
formation of the borate ester 1a should be expected to 
dominate in direct competition during a phosphorolysis 
reaction, which we could confirm by subjecting phosphorolysis 
reaction mixtures with increasing borate concentrations to 
NMR analysis (Fig. S13). Further thermodynamic experiments 
indicated that this biased esterification is primarily driven by 
entropic effects. Arrhenius plots of the 1a1a equilibrium 
obtained by 
1H NMR revealed a drastic temperature
dependence, favoring the presence of the free nucleoside at 
higher temperatures (Fig. S11). In support of these 
observations, Arrhenius plots for the borate esterification 
derived from equilibrium shifts in the phosphorolysis reaction 
indicated an approach to an energetic balance between 1a 
and Rib1P at higher temperatures (Fig. S5).

Description:
Depleted by the dominant borate ester in dilute aqueous solution at room temperature.

Text:
Collectively, 
these results describe 1a as the dominant borate ester in this 
reaction system, responsible for depleting the pool of free 
nucleoside in dilute aqueous solution at room temperature. Consistent with this conclusion, the 2deoxy nucleoside 
deoxy1a, incapable of forming 1a or 1a, did not show an 
equilibrium shift during its phosphorolysis in the presence of 
borate or any reaction with borate discernible by NMR (Fig. S15). Next, we sought to identify the cause of the apparently 
reduced reaction rates in the presence of borate by enlisting 
kinetic studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This 
effect was especially prominent with borate concentrations 
greater than 20 mM and led to decreases in the reaction rate 
of GtPyNP by more than a factor of four, as illustrated in Figure 
2D.
