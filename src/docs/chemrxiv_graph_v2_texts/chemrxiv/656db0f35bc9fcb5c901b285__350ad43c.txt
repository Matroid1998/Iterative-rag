Synthetic approaches to enantiopure P(V) compounds can be subdivided into five categories (Scheme 1B).1116 The first 
approach is classical resolution andor separation of diastereomers or enantiomers by chromatography (Scheme 1B, i).1723 A 
second approach revolves around the use of labile chiral auxiliaries which can be displaced by sequential diastereoselective 
nucleophilic additions to afford enantioenriched P(V) species (Scheme 1B, ii).2454 Thirdly, chiral, yet racemic at P(V) 
electrophiles bearing a single leaving group (and often possessing a chiral sidechain) can be coupled diastereoselectively to 
enantiopure nucleophiles employing chiral catalysts (Scheme 1B, iii).5564 A subsequent approach involves the direct 
functionalization of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) by means of a metal catalyst bearing chiral ligands to obtain tertiary 
phosphine oxides.6592 To date, however, this approach has been limited to the synthesis of all carbon substituted phosphine 
oxides (Scheme 1B, iv).
