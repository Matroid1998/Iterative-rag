Description:
A residue that can be targeted by covalent fragments in protein interactions.

Text:
The use of electrophilic fragment libraries has emerged 
within chemical biology as a powerful approach for the identi
fication of fragmentprotein interactions.2830 Electrophilic 
fragments covalently modify the protein, facilitating the use of 
intact protein liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC
MS) for rapid and robust screening of libraries (103 com
pounds) to identify binders.28 Covalent fragments that target 
cysteine residues have been identified and successfully opti
mised to cellactive tool compounds for proteins including e.g. HOIP and KRas.3132 A limitation of these libraries is that a cys
teine residue must be present in the vicinity of the binding site, 
and therefore, only a subset of proteins can be targeted.3334
