The previous predicted cyclo18carbon, an sphybridized molecular carbon allotrope,15 was firstly synthesis and 
32 
observed using atom manipulation technique on Cu(111) surface covered by bilayer NaCl at 5.0 K by K. Kaiser 
33 
and coworkers in Aug. 2019.6 Their work raised immense attention from both experimental and theoretical 
34 
scientists once published.
