Description:
Prevents capping failure sequences during solid phase synthesis.

Text:
The use of an unprotected 
phosphoramidite also prevents capping failure sequences during solid phase synthesis, which could put a 
limit on the length of ORN that can be synthesized, and may require the ORN product to be purified with 
gel electrophoresis instead of the more scalable HPLC. In addition, the deprotection needs to use DBU, 
which prevents the method for the synthesis of ORN containing some sensitive nucleosides such as 
mchm5U. Therefore, developing new methods for sensitive ON synthesis remains a significant and 
challenging task. In 2016, we published our first paper on sensitive ODN synthesis.1516 We used the Dmoc group for 
amino protection and a Dmoc linker to anchor ODN to solid support. ODNs synthesized can be represented 
by 1a (Scheme 1).
