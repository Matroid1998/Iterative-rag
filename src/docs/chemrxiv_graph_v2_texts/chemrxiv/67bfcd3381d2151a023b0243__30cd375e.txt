Description:
Contributes to increased carbon footprints in industrial processes.

Text:
Current industrial scale methane valorization predominantly relies on indirect, syngas
mediated routes, such as steam methane reforming followed by FischerTropsch synthesis.9 
Although these processes are wellestablished, this twostep route is energyintensive,10 
thermodynamically inefficient,11 and suffers from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking,4,12 
which collectively drives up operational costs and carbon footprints.
