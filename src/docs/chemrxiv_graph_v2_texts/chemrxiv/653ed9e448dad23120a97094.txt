Description:
Cations that permeate through the TRPV1 ion channel, leading to desensitization of TRPV1 receptors.

Resiniferatoxin was recently granted 
Breakthrough Therapy by the FDA for pain caused by osteoarthritis in the knee, increasing 
mobility. As a TRPV1 agonist, it provides prolonged pain relief by allowing calcium cations to 
permeate through the TRPV1 ion channel, and this large influx of cations desensitizes the 
TRPV1 receptors. Besides pain, studies have shown the potential for resiniferatoxin and other TRPV1 
agonists to treat inflammation, a major cause of further cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis.
