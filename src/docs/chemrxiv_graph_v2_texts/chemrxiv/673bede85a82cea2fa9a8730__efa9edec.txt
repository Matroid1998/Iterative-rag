Description:
Finely dispersed carbides in the FCC austenite matrix of FeMnAlC steels.

Text:
Until 2015, lightweight FeMnAlC steels (also known as TRIPLEX steels) with high specific 
strength (density 18 lower than that of conventional steels and strength 1 GPa) were the 
main centres of attraction in the community of automotivegrade lowdensity steels (Park 2013; 
Raabe et al. 2014b; Kim et al. 2015; Yao et al. 2016a; Park et al. 2019a). Their microstructures 
comprised of Fe(Al, Mn) based BCC phase and finely dispersed L12carbides 
((Fe,Mn)3AlCx (x  1) carbides) in FCCaustenite matrix (Yao et al. 2016b; Wang et al. 2020; 
GutierrezUrrutia 2021). However, the primary limitation of these steels was the low strain 
hardening owing to the precipitation of shearable carbides. Besides, as reported in Ref. (Kim
