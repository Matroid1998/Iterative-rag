Description:
A cluster used by enzymes to reductively cleave Sadenosylmethionine.

Text:
For example, radical Sadenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzymes make use of 
a 4Fe4S cluster to reductively cleave Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) into methionine and 5
deoxyadenosyl radical, the latter of which is used to initiate a variety of radical reactions that have 
been reviewed previously.10,11,12,13 In some cases, electron transfer may be an intermediate step rather 
than the complete function of an enzyme, such as the case of the biotin synthase rSAM mechanism 
where the FeS clusters mediate the donation of a sulfur atom.14 
Redox activity is an important property in enzymes.
