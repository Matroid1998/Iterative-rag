Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction, requiring the transfer of four electrons per molecule.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, Eq. 1) is one of the most studied electrochemical processes, both experimentally and

theoretically. 6

During the ORR, four electrons per oxygen molecule must be transferred. At the same time, several chemical bonds rearrange, 
9 
making it comparatively slow even on the most catalytically active surfaces, such as platinum and its alloys. Thus, understanding 
0 
the mechanism of the ORR to improve and develop catalysts has been the focus of many studies for many decades.

Description:
A molecule that can be activated by electron transfer or split chemically in different reaction pathways.

During this

time, the scientific community has converged towards two mechanisms that differ in the initial activation of the oxygen molecule

In the associative path, the oxygen molecule is activated by the transfer of an electron, followed by cleaving the OO bond during 
3 
second electron transfer (Eq. 2a, b). 4

In contrast, the molecular oxygen bond is chemically split in the dissociative path without an electron transfer (Eq. 3). 7
