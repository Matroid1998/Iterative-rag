Description:
The fraction of sp2 carbon is 25 to 30% in the system below 20 nitrogen.

Text:
However, for more than 20 nitrogen, no further clustering takes place and the system attains 
saturation. Below 20 nitrogen, the fraction of sp2 carbon is 25 to 30 similar as N free taC H 1. 2. Raman Spectroscopy 
The Raman spectra (Almega, USA using HeNe laser) of the films consisted of mainly three features, a G 
(graphite) peak at around 1580 cm1 due to optical zone center vibrations (E2g mode) of pairs of sp2C 
atoms in aromatic rings or olefinic chains; a D (disordered) peak around 1360 cm1, which arises from the 
limitations in the graphite domain size induced by grain boundaries or imperfections i.e. substitutional N
