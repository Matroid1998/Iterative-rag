Description:
A biochemical feature of tumors exploited by activatable agents to release photosensitizers in cancerous tissues.

Text:
Activatable agents exploit some of the biochemical features of tumors (e.g., low 
pH, glutathione, proteases) to release photosensitizers in cancerous tissues, showing promise in 
reducing bystander toxicity.1620 Alternatively, photosensitizers can be conjugated to antibodies, which 
favor accumulation in tissues that express specific cellsurface markers.21,22 Whereas these approaches 
can be effective in the presence of abundant biomarkers, they show limitations at early stages of disease 
when the biochemical and proteomic signatures of target cells are not dissimilar to those of surrounding 
healthy tissues (e.g., microtumors). New chemical designs to directly deliver photosensitizers to 
individual pathogenic and malignant cells under in vivo physiological conditions would significantly 
extend the clinical applications of PDT.
