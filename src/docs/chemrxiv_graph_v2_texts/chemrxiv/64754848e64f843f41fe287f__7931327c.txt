Implicit solvation approaches, which replace explicit
solvent configurations with polarizable continua or liq
uid density distributions, are more computationally ex
pedient and widely applied in conjunction with DFT
in firstprinciples electrochemistry. These models by
pass the phasespace sampling issue and capture the im
pact of the liquid in a single electronic structure cal
culation, which is particularly attractive for combining
with highfidelity electronic structure methods such as
GW. Some of the ingredients for solvated GW emerged
in explorations of electrochemical systems with GW using
