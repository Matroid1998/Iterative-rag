Description:
Used in catalytic amounts for multicomponent reactions involving dicarbofunctionalisation.

Text:
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs), wherein three compounds 
intermolecularly combine in a sequential manner, are revealed 
as ideal strategies in diversityoriented synthesis. The formation 
of two new vicinal carboncarbon bonds by addition of two 
different reagents across terminal and internal olefins is one of 
the most challenging multicomponent reactions. This type of 
dicarbofunctionalisation sequence provides 1,2substituted 
alkanes, principally with the aid of catalytic amounts of Pd, Cu 
or Ni complexes.1 The intrinsic sequences along the catalytic 
cycles, with the mentioned transition metal complexes, involves 
the formation of undesired byproducts, due to the cross 
coupling between both reagents or Hecktype products 
formation, as a consequence of inherent Helimination 
pathways. These drawbacks limit the application of this method 
to essentially C(sp2) or C(sp) hybridised reagents, R1X and R2Y, 
(Scheme 1A).

Description:
A catalyst used in metal-catalyzed assembly of components involving alkenes.

Text:
Current efforts are focused to permit the efficient 
metal catalysed assembly of the three components, alkene  R1
X  R2Y, with particular emphasis to the formation of two 
C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds across the alkene. However, this ambitious 
goal has scarcely succeed and the most remarkable examples 
are based on the use of Ni,24 Ti,5,6 Fe7 or Co8 catalysts. Since the intermolecular addition of two different C(sp3) alkyl 
groups across an alkene remains one of the most challenging 
1,2dicarbofunctionalization reactions, the use of accessible 
alkenylboronic esters as substrates represents a synthetic 
opportunity. Four strategic platforms were launched to allow 
the formation of two C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds on vinylboronic acid 
pinacol ester 1 (Scheme 1BE).
