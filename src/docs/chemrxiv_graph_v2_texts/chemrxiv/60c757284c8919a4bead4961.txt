Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries due to its high energy density and power density.

Modern portable devices and electric vehicles are increasingly demanding highperformance, highenergy density
storage materials with fast rechargeable capabilities. So far, lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have been the fundamental
energy source of those devices due to the high energydensity and powerdensity. However, the lack of Li sources, high
production cost, and safety issues are signicant drawbacks of LIBs. To address these issues, a vast amount of research
has been carried out to nd alternative energy carriers for rechargeable batteries 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Among various types
of ions, Mg ions attracted enormous attention due to their bivalency which offers high energydensity. The cost of
production of energy storage can also be reduced by utilizing Mg because of its high abundance 1, 2.
