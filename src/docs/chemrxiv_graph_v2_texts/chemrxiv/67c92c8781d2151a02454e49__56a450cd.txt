Description:
An element used in alloying to improve wear resistance but poses environmental and regulatory challenges due to its toxicity.

Text:
. Wearresistant bronze alloys are critical materials in industries requiring 
durable components under high mechanical stress, such as in heavy machinery, automotive 
parts, and gearboxes. Traditionally, the wear resistance of bronze has been improved by 
alloying with elements such as lead, nickel, and aluminum.1 While effective to an extent, 
these alloying solutions require high material concentrations (e.g., 115 wt) to achieve 
moderate improvements in performance.2 Moreover, the use of toxic elements like lead poses 
environmental and regulatory challenges, emphasizing the need for sustainable alternatives.34 
Despite advances in nanotechnology, graphene derivatives have yet to find industrial 
application in metallic systems due to limitations in thermal stability, dispersion, and 
compatibility with hightemperature manufacturing processes. Graphenebased materials
