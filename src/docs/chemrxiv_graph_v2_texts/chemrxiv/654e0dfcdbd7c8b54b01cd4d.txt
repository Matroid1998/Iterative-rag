Description:
An n-type semiconductor used in nDSCs.

Moreover, the theoretical photovoltage (cumulative in a series design) of 
the liquid pn tandem DSC is also limited by the energy difference between the conduction 
band (CB) of ntype semiconductor, such as TiO2, used in nDSCs and the valence band (VB) 
of ptype semiconductor, such as NiO, used in pDSCs, typically ca. 1 V (Figure 1A).9,10 To 
overcome these hurdles, we previously proposed the concept and design principle of pn tandem 
solidstate dyesensitized solar cells (tssDSCs)17 in which a hole transport material (HTM) and 
electron transport material (ETM) are used to replace the liquid electrolyte to extract holes and 
electrons from dyesensitized photoanode and dyesensitized photocathode, respectively.
