Description:
Garners aldehyde is used in strategies to enantioselectively construct 2substituted aminoethanols.

As 
building blocks for organic synthesis, 2substituted aminoethanols are a versatile input for chiral 
auxiliaries and catalysts.1 In medicinal chemistry they also serve as vital precursors for 
constructing chiral morpholines and piperazines.2,3 Numerous strategies to enantioselectively 
construct this unit have been reported over the years such as addition of nucleophilic carbon 
fragments into Garners aldehyde, reduction of amino acids, asymmetric reductive amination and 
Sharpless asymmetric aminohydroxylation, all of which are accessed by polar bond analysis (2e 
disconnections, Figure 1B).4,5 Although these approaches are valuable, a heavy reliance on harsh 
reactants such as organolithiummagnesium and LiAlH4 or toxic metals (Os) limits their 
widespread use. By far, the most widely adopted approach employs nucleophilic addition of 
organometallic reagents to chiral imines (Davis, Ellman, etc.

Description:
A starting material in the enantiocontrolled synthesis of the natural product DAHD.

Text:
Emblematic of this 
predicament is the reported enantiocontrolled synthesis of the natural product DAHD (3) through 
an 8step route commencing from Garners aldehyde wherein only 3 steps forge a CC bond or 
install a key stereocenter.9 Attempts to add radicals to such imines have been met with limited 
success and require an additional electron withdrawing group or extended conjugation to enhance 
reactivity.1015 Application of radical retrosynthetic logic to this problem could dramatically 
simplify access to such structures as has been demonstrated in a variety of different contexts.1623 
As transformations that proceed by way of radical intermediates are often compatible with 
common functional groups such as carbonyls and unprotected acidicbasic functionalities, the 
chemoselectivity issues present in polar bond disconnections might therefore disappear.
