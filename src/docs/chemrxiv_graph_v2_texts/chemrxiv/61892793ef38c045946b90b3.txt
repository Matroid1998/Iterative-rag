Description:
A nonpolar solvent used as a stand-in for gas-phase measurements in electronic absorption spectra studies.

Text:
The quality of the excitation energy calculation is usually evaluated by
comparing emb to the maxima of measured electronic absorption spectra, whereas the shift
is compared to the shift in the chromophores absorption maximum between the solvent of
interest and the maximum in a nonpolar solvent such as nhexane, where the nonpolar
solvent measurement acts as a standin for the more demanding gasphase measurements. Singlereference quantum chemical methods, such as timedependent Density Functional
