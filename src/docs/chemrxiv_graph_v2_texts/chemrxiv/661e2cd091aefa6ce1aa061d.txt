Description:
A conserved binding site component in carbohydrate recognition domains of C-type lectin receptors.

Text:
To detect pathogens and thus potential danger, antigen presenting cells of our immune system 
possess a battery of receptors, called pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), that are dedicated to their 
surveillance and identification1. Among PRRs, Ctype lectin receptors (CLRs) are dedicated to the 
recognition of carbohydrate molecular patterns associated to pathogens, and can then contribute to shape 
an immune response. This family of receptors shares a common domain, known as the Carbohydrate 
Recognition Domain (CRD), containing a conserved calcium binding site used for the recognition of 
carbohydrates. The diverse CLRs differ in size, oligomerization state and signaling pathways, and will 
therefore have a different impact on the immune system depending on the panels of glycans they 
recognize2,3.
