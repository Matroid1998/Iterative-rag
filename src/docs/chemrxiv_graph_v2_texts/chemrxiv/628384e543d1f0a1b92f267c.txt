Description:
A layered MOF studied for its capacitive performance in supercapacitors.

Text:
Many MOFs can be synthesised with a range of different particle morphologies and threedimensional 
pore networks, as well as different degrees of particle agglomeration.17,18 While significant work has 
examined the impact of pore structure on the capacitive performances of porous carbon materials and 
other families of electrically conductive MOFs, little work has been performed to understand how 
morphology impact the performances of layered MOFs in supercapacitors.1922 This has hindered the 
development of layered MOF for energy storage applications, with potential performance gains to be 
had from optimising the microstructure. One notable exception is the work of Dinc et al., which studied 
the influence of microstructure on the capacitive performance of Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP  2,3,6,7,10,11
