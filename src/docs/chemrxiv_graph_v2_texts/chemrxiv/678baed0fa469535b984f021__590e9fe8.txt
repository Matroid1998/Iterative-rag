Description:
Chemical intermediates whose conversion methods remain unexplored.

Text:
Moreover, methods for converting 
these intermediates into monofluoromethyl ketones or methyl 
ketones remain unexplored. In this study, we sought to develop a new difluoroenolate sur
rogate, difluoroenol phosphinate from trifluorometylketones, as 
a versatile intermediate (Figure 1C). Phosphine oxides or phos
phites are known to react with electrondeficient ketones via nu
cleophilic attack, followed by a phosphaBrook rearrangement 
to generate stabilized anions.12,13 We hypothesized that apply
ing this chemistry to trifluoromethyl ketones would form such 
anions, which could undergo fluoride elimination prior to pro
tonation, producing difluoroenol phosphinates. These interme
diates are structurally analogous to difluoroenol silyl ethers and 
are anticipated to participate in functionalization reactions.

Products obtained from the defluorination of phosphinates.

Additionally, we envisaged that iterative defluorination of these 
phosphinates could provide monofluoromethyl ketones and me
thyl ketones, enabling stepwise access to less fluorinated deriv
atives. A distinctive advantage of difluoroenol phosphinates is
