Description:
Increase peptide solubility, sol-gel transition ability, and storage modulus through proline-proline-type self-assembly.

Text:
For example, for alphapeptides, it has been shown 
that tuning hydrophobic and  interactions through the amino acid sequence was critical to determining whether a 
percolating gel phase could form 10. Changing the amino acid sequence has also been found to change the secondary 
structures formed as the peptides selfassemble in the case of a short 8residue peptide  GV8, causing transitions 
between helical and different sheet structures 11, and resulting in differences in the rheological properties. For the 
RADA family of peptides that selfassemble due to alternating hydrophobic and negatively charged peptides, the effect 
of adding proline amino acids at both the C and N terminals was shown to increase the peptide solubility, solgel 
transition ability and increase the storage modulus through the effect of prolineprolinetype selfassembly.
