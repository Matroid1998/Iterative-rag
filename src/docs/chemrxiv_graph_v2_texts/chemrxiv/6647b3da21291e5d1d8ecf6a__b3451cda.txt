Description:
A metallic reductant used in crosselectrophile reductive couplings.

Text:
Metalcatalyzed crosscouplings of arylmetal reagents are 
among the most broadly utilized methods in the discovery and 
manufacture of smallmolecule drugs.1,2 As conventional 
crosscouplings require premetalated reagents, which most 
often derive from halides, efforts to develop direct reductive 
crosscouplings of halide partners have been put forth.3,4 The 
majority of such crosselectrophile reductive couplings exploit 
metallic reductants (Zn, Mn).
