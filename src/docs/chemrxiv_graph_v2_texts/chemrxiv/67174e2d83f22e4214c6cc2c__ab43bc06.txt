Description:
An intermediate in glycosylation reactions, proceeding through an SN1-like mechanism.

Carbohydrates are an important class of natural com
pounds, which are involved in immunology, gene expres
sion, as a fuel source for metabolism, etc.13 It is therefore
of interest to be able to control the outcome of chemi
cal glycosylations, with regards to stereoselectivity and
high yield. Different procedures for doing so have been
established relying on either a catalyst or a promoter.4,5
However, the procedures often involve temperatures below
0C andor harsh reagents, making them inconvenient for
nonspecialists. It is intrinsically challenging to control
the stereoselectivity at the anomeric position, due to the
complicated nature of carbohydrates and glycosylation re
actions. Glycosylations are often assumed to proceed through
an oxocarbenium ion intermediate, in an SN1like mech
anism.
