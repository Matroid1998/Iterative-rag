Description:
Detected by imidazo and pyridineferrocenes as a heavy metal ion.

Text:
One specific application of ferroceneazaheterocycles is 
in organic chemosensors for detecting heavy metals, which are significant environmental 
pollutants 13. Recently developed imidazo and pyridineferrocenes 710 act as a highly 
selective chromogenic, fluorescent or redox chemosensors for the detection of Pb2, Hg2 
and Zn2 ions 14, 15. On the other hand, we have recently developed an interest in tetrahydropyridazines 
and discovered that this relatively rare class of sixmembered, nitrogencontaining 
heterocycles is widely distributed in numerous significant natural products and 
pharmaceuticals. A peptide antibiotic antrimycin 11 displayed strong antibacterial activity 
against Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 607 16. Versatile tetrahydropyridazines
