Description:
A divalent cation used in the formation of isomorphous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).

We have recently introduced a series of MOFs based on 
tetrahedral pyridyl ligands with divalent cations, including 
copper and nickel.4548 These MOFs have an isomorphous 
crystallographic packing as well as a high level of uni
formity (dimensions and morphology). Their fascinating 
morphologies can be widely varied by using different ex
perimental parameters (e.g., metaltoligand ratios, cati
ons, and anions). No additives have been used to direct 
their morphology and dimensions. To control and predict 
the packingmorphology relationship, we investigated cat
ion metathesis using a new, manganesebased MOF having 
the same rare P622 spacegroup as our other reported crys
tals (Scheme 1).4548 The crystal structure is porous and ex
hibits two geometrically and compositionally different 
channels. Cation metathesis was used here to control and
