Description:
Involved in Pd-catalyzed carbon-halogen insertion reactions.

This 
32 
fundamental importance has led to the use of BDE (and its free energy counterpart) values across 
33 
multiple domains in chemistry, ranging from the determination of possible reaction mechanisms 
34 
to computational mass spectroscopy.1 For example, BDE values have been used to assess the 
35 
difference in bond strengths of primary, secondary, and tertiary CH bonds,2 to quantify the 
36 
geometric deformation necessary to reach the transition structures for Pdcatalyzed carbon
37 
halogen insertion,3 for the prediction of likely molecular fragments observed in the mass spectra 
38 
of short peptides4, breakdown of large biomass such as lignin5, comparing the stability of organic 
39 
radicals6 and design of de novo radicals for organic redox flow batteries.7 Due to the broad utility 
40 
and applicability of BDE values, significant effort has been invested in obtaining quantitative 
41 
measurements.
