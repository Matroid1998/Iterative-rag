Description:
Multiple bonds notable for their rich electronic structure and unique spectroscopic properties.

Text:
The concept of multiple bonding between metals dates back to the late 1920s with the rst struc
tural conrmation in 1964.1 Over the last 60 years, multiple bonds between a wide variety of
transition metals have been assigned bond orders ranging from single to sextuple.24 Nowadays,
synthetic chemists seek out new metalmetal bonds for as catalysts, building blocks in metal
organic frameworks, photosensitizers, and molecular conductors.3,58 Group 6 metalmetal bonds
have been broadly studied for their interesting bonding and unique photophysical properties.9,10
Of these, CrCr multiple bonds are notable because of their rich electronic structure and unique
spectroscopic properties.

Description:
The bond is composed of multiple partial bonds and its bond order often does not correlate with bond distance.

The concept of an eective bond order (EBO), that accounts
for partial occupation of lowlying antibonding orbitals, has been used to quantify the nature of
the overall CrCr bond that is composed of multiple partial bonds.19,20 Furthermore, these com
putations highlight that the multicongurational electronic structure of Cr2 bonds is more nuanced
compared to Mo2 and W2 analogues.20 As a result, the CrCr bond order often does not correlate
with bond distance.1922 Note that for some particularly short CrCr distances, density functional
theory (DFT) has been used successfully since the electronic structure can be represented by fully
occupied bonding orbitals.23
The lack of correlation between bond distance and bond order motivated a number of vibra
tional studies of these compounds; diraction studies alone cannot be used to predict bonding or,
in turn, vibrational force constants.
