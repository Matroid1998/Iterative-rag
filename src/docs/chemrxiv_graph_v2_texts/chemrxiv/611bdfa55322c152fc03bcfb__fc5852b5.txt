Description:
Reagents that are stable under air and moisture and easily accessible for use in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Transition metal catalyzed crosscoupling reactions such as SuzukiMiyaura1, Heck210, 
Stille11, Hiyama,12 Negishi13, and Sonogashira reactions are likely to be the most power tool 
for the formation of CC bonds for the past four decades. All these reactions have shown their 
widespread applicability ranging from academic area to research. Some of the reactions have 
also been applied in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and fine material industries. The 
SuzukiMiayura cross coupling was remained the most attractive alternative for CC bonds 
formation since its discovery in 1979. The wide range of applicability of this reaction is 
largely attributed to mild reaction conditions, broad range of functional group tolerance, easy 
access to organoboron reagents, and their stability under air and moisture.
