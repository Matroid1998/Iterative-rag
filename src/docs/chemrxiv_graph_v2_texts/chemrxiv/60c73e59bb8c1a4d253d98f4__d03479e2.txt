Description:
Strongly hydrated salts that decrease the cloud point temperature.

Text:
(I) Linear and rather steep de
crease of the cloud point temperature (an approximate but di
rectmeasure of the LCST)with salt concentration was observed
for most strongly hydrated salts, such as sulfates, acetates, flu
orides, and chlorides. (II) Initial weak increase of the cloud
point temperature at low salt concentrations, typically below
1 m, with subsequent decrease at higher concentrations. Only
recently a third regime, which was predicted by computer sim
ulations26 and is characterized by strongly attractive bridging
