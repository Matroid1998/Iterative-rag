Description:
In an ionic state in ternary Ru complex hydride catalysts.

Text:
The ternary ruthenium hydrides 
ability to efficiently synthesize NH3 at 10 bar and  573 K conditions 
lies in the unique chemistry of the coordination complex and the 
alkali (alkaline earth) metal framework, facilitating a catalytic 
mechanism bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous concepts, 
which are clearly distinct from the Ru metal catalyst. For ternary Ru 
complex hydride catalysts, Ru is in an ionic state, and N2 undergoes 
nondissociative hydrogenolysis over the hydride(H)rich and 
electronrich RuH64 complex with the aid of the surrounding Li or 
Ba cations. The dynamic and synergistic engagement of all the 
components of the ternary hydrides creates a reaction path with a 
narrow energy span and leads to ammonia production with superior 
activities.
