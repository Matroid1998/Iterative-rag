Description:
A purine nucleobase detected in meteorites.

Text:
Why had nature selected the molecules with the simple
combination of ring and fusedring structures as the genetic code? They would have been
dominant in a certain period in the Earth through the chemical evolution starting from
prebiotic conditions. The other source of pyrimidine basis would be extraterrestrial, and
several nucleobases were detected from meteorites as well as amino acids. The chemi
cal evolution of the prebiotic molecules outside the Earth would be an essential topic to
disentangle the mystery of the origin of life. Uracil is the rst pyrimidine nucleobase found in carbonaceous meteorites1, behind
the detection of purine nucleobases, adenine, and guanine2. The tendency of nucleobases
in meteorites and possible reactions have been discussed3.
