Besides the 
two examples mentioned above, the group of Zaccheria reported 
the use of various simple copper (I) and (II) salts in combination 
with amine ligands to catalytically dehydrogenate FA (Figure 1).12 
These reactions take place with high selectivity, but a high 
temperature (95 C) is required, and the conversion is low (0.9 
mol Cu, TON 72 in 22 h for CuI with triethylamine). In a 
mechanistic study, it was found that the ratedetermining step 
(RDS) is the dissociation of an amine ligand from the mononuclear 
copper complexes, which opens up a free coordination site for 
hydride elimination.13 In this case, the high barrier for ligand 
dissociation necessitates the harsh reaction conditions.
