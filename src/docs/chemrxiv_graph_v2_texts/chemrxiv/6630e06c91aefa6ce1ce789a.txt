Description:
A type of mycolic acid with immunostimulatory properties.

Text:
The natural MMG lipids
contain either an  or a ketomycolic acid, and both types of mycolic acids have comparable
immunostimulatory properties.2
Synthetic MMG analogs can be used for potentiating the immune response induced
by subunit vaccines.1 Their lipid acid moiety is simplified and shorter in comparison to
their natural counterparts, yet they possess a comparable activity.
