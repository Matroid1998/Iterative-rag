Description:
In typeI QDs, the band gap of the core is smaller than that of the shell, localizing charge carriers in the core.

According to this alignment in the coreshell QDs, the 
coreshell structures of interest in this study are classified into four main types typeI (Figure 1B), 
inverted typeI (Figure 1, C), typeII (Figure 1D) and quasi typeII (Figure 1E).22,23 In typeI QDs, such as 
InPZnS, the band gap of the core is smaller than that of the shell, and the position of the energy bands 
of the band gap of the core falls within that of the shell (Figure 1B). This makes the generated charge 
carriers localized in the core of the typeI QDs and consequently can induce difficult accessibility during 
the charge transfer process.
