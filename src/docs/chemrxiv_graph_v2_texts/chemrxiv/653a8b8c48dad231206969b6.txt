Description:
A drug whose properties can be affected by polymorphism, impacting pharmaceutical materials.

Text:
Molecular crystals are prevalent across a diverse range of materials applications, including optoelectronics, pharma
ceuticals, and energetic materials.13 The desirable properties of these materials are often strongly tied to the crystal
structurethe arrangement of the molecules in the crystal latticeand changes solely in the crystal structure can
greatly affect a wide range of the physiochemical properties of the crystals. This is seen clearly in polymorphs, which
are crystals of the same compound but with different crystal structures.4 The properties of polymorphs often differ
substantially, such that the unexpected appearance of a polymorph can result in loss of control over material properties;
the example of polymorphism in the drug Ritonavir illustrates the impact that this can have in pharmaceutical materi
