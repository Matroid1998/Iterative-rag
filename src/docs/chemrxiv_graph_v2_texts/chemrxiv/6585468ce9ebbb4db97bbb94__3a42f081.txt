Description:
A polymer with properties similar to high-density polyethylene (HDPE).

Text:
Important milestones have been the introduction of covalent adaptive networks (CANs) and socalled vitrimers, which 
rely on a catalytic transesterification reaction at elevated temperature,28,29 as well as the discovery that aliphatic long
chain polyester, which can be produced from renewable feedstocks and recycled by transesterification, exhibit properties 
similar to highdensity polyethylene (HDPE).30,31 In this context, the modification of polymers exhibits a great potential
