Description:
Used to synthesize polycarbonate urethanes with good blood compatibility.

Text:
Recently, Zue et 
28 
al.35 have used poly (1,6hexanediol)carbonate diols (PCDL), 4,4methylenebis (cyclohexyl isocyanate) 
29 
(H12MDI), 1,6hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and 1,4butanediol (BDO) to synthesize polycarbonate urethanes 
30 
and studied their biocompatibility using hemolytic and platelet adhesion tests, and they have shown that these materials 
31 
have a great ability to be used as biomaterials due to their good blood compatibility. In another study, Khan et al.36 
32 
have shown that good mechanical and chemical properties of polycarbonate urethanes make them suitable to use in 
33 
biomedical applications.
