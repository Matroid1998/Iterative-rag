Long chain molecules used as a model for negatively charged surfaces.

The binding of transition metal ions to charged surfaces is vital in many processes, such as 
protein folding,1 atmospheric chemical reactions,2 and geochemical sequestration and 
transport of contaminants already from submicromolar concentrations.3 A multitude of 
studies have demonstrated the ion specific nature of surface binding phenomena, in which ions 
with the same charge can interact and subsequently alter monolayer properties in different 
manners.411 Long chain fatty acids have been used as a model for negatively charged 
surfaces to investigate the cation binding due to the prevalence of carboxylic acid groups in 
biological and atmospheric chemistry systems.1214 
Grazing incidence Xray diffraction (GIXD) measurements and spectroscopic studies of 
metallic soaps have been combined in an attempt to correlate the coordination structures of the 
carboxylate moiety with its vibrational signatures and the ionspecific nature of the metallic 
cations.1517 Similar investigations have been carried out for hydrated carboxylate anions in 
aqueous solution.18 However, less is known about coordination structures of metallic cations 
to carboxylates constrained at interfaces, especially for polyvalent ions.
