Description:
A compound used in the construction of silicon-oxygen containing optoelectronic materials.

of the 
SiO unit in such molecules might alter the photophysical properties. SCBs attached with pyrene (4p) or 
the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) (4q) reacted with water efficiently, providing a new approach for the 
construction of siliconoxygen containing optoelectronic materials. Table 3. Scope of SCBs.a,b 

a Reaction conditions 4 (0.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv), water (0.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv), Pd(OAc)2 (2.2 mg, 5.0 mol), DavePhos (7.9 mg, 
10 mol), Toluene (1.0 mL), 60 C, 6 h. b Isolated yield. c 100 C, 12 h. d The reaction was conducted on 10 mmol scale. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023z5bsp ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000264423008 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
