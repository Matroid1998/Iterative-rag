Description:
An oxidation reagent used for the reoxidation of deuterated alcohols.

Text:
. Recently, several reports have documented the oxidation of monodeuterated alcohols to deuteratedenriched 
aldehydes at synthetically useful levels (8598 atom D) by exploitation of a kinetic isotope effect (KIE).1,2,3,4 
These methods provide a convenient alternative to preexisting syntheses of C1deuterated alcohols5,6 since they 
allow the use of the relatively inexpensive NaBD4 to install one deuterium atom by reaction with an aldehyde, 
followed by reoxidation using standard oxidation reagents. The oxidation reagents reported to be successful so 
far for this latter process are pyridinium chlorochromatesilica,1 manganese dioxide2 and pyridinium 
chlorochromate.3,4The Swern oxidation78 has also been examined by Giagou and Meyer in 2010 in comprehensive 
experimental and computational analysis of this aspect,9 finding a relatively low KIE of 3 which would limit the 
level of deuterium enrichment.
