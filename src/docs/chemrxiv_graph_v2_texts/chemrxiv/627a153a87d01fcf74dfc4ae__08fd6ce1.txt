Description:
Phosgene and isocyanate-free polyurethanes obtained through the polyaddition reaction of diamines onto bis(5membered cyclic carbonate)s.

Text:
Polyhydroxyurethanes (PHUs) are phosgene and isocyanatefree polyurethanes (PUs) that are 
foreseen as a promising alternative to conventional polyurethanes (PUs), when European and 
North American directives will restrict the use of allergenic and carcinogenic isocyanates. 1,2 
They are usually obtained through the polyaddition reaction of diamines onto bis(5membered 
cyclic carbonate)s (bis5CC), resulting in the formation of urethane linkages and hydroxyl 
groups (OH) (scheme 1).
