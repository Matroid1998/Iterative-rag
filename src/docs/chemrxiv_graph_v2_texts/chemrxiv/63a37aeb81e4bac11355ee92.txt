Description:
A solvent used in chemical reactions, added slowly to avoid sparking.

Although the IC50 values are lower compared to other active 
255 
antineoplastic compounds on the market the treatment of Pancreatic cancer is still evolving and 
256 
the need to produce antineoplastics is pertinent. Continued SAR and analogs studies are currently 
257 
being conducted to increase bioavailability and increase IC50 values from micromolar to 
258 
nanomolar concentrations. 259

Experimental Section 
261 
General Hydrogenation Conditions A 20L flask equipped with a reflux condenser and an 
262 
addition funnel was purged with argon for 10 minutes at 1 bar. PdC (0.1 molar ) was added to 
263 
the reaction slowly using a powder funnel under argon. The flask was then purged with argon for 
264 
10 minutes at 1 bar. Ethanol (1L) was added slowly to avoid sparking the solvent.
