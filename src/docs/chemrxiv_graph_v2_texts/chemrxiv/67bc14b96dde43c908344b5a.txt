. Carbazole, a tricyclic heterocycle, is a privileged scaffold in medicinal chemistry and natural 
products (Fig. 1A).13 Moving away from the flatness of its structure, tetrahydrocarbazolea 
threedimensional (hetero)aromatic compoundhas also found broad applications in drug 
discovery (Fig. 1A).46 Compared to their fully aromatic counterparts, semisaturated ring systems 
often exhibit higher solubility, improved targeting affinity, and specificity, alongside reduced 
toxicity.5, 710 This aligns with the wellrecognized escape from flatland concept.1113 Increasing 
saturation (Fsp3) in a molecule has proven to be a valuable strategy for enhancing clinical success. Consequently, the construction of semisaturated polycyclic scaffolds has become a hot and 
challenging topic.
