Description:
An element involved in an autocatalytic and heterogeneous photochemical reaction mechanism known as the bromine explosion, which generates bromine radicals.

As volcanoes can be significant emitters of halogens11,12, it has been hypothesized that bromine chemistry, more 
specifically the socalled bromine explosion, could cause GEM oxidation in volcanic plumes1315. The bromine 
explosion, regularly observed at polar sunrise16,17, is an autocatalytic and heterogeneous photochemical reaction 
80 
mechanism that causes the rapid generation of bromine radicals1315, one of the most important GEM oxidants in 
the atmosphere5,6,18. Von Glasow (2010)13 suggested that such inplume GEM oxidation could significantly reduce 
the net contribution of volcanism to the atmospheric Hg burden by shortening the atmospheric lifetime of volcanic 
Hg as well as background Hg entrained during plume dilution.
