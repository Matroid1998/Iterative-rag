Description:
A hyperpolarized compound used in MRI to detect early stages of prostate and breast cancer.

Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)6,7 is the most elaborate 
HP method with applications from proteomics8 to realtime in 
vivo metabolomics.9,10 The rapid development of dissolution 
DNP (dDNP) was triggered by the discovery of fast in vivo 
conversion of hyperpolarized 113Cpyruvate (113CPyr) to 1
13Clactate (113CLac) in some malignant tumors and 
inflammations, known as the Warburg effect.11 Administration 
of hyperpolarized 113CPyr and monitoring metabolic 
conversion by MRI in vivo is considered to be a promising 
modality to detect early stages of prostate and breast cancer.12 
However, the main drawback of dDNP (disregard the high price) 
is its relatively low hyperpolarization throughput, which for 
commercial systems is 1 hour per sample while the lifetime of 
HP 113Cpyruvate is only 1 minute.
