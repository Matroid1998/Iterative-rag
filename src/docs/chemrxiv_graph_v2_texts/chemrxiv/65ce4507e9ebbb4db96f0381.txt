An illicit drug that threatens health and social stability.

Text:
In forensic toxicology the identification and quantification of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in 
biological samples, is crucial to confirm drug intake. Drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, tramadol, 
cannabinoids, morphine, amphetamines) are illicit drugs that threaten health and social stability. The 
global number of drug users is expected to grow 25  by 2050, directly impacting road safety and 
public health 1 with a concomitant increase in the requirement for testing. Many analytical procedures 
have been described to quantified commonly encountered drugs of abuse and their metabolites, in 
biological matrices including saliva 2, sweat 3, hair 4, urine 5 and blood by liquid chromatography and 
gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS, GCMS) 1, 6, 7.
