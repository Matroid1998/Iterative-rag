Description:
A potentially tridentate scaffold used for the synthesis of Ru(III) 2alkyne complexes.

Along these lines, it is of fundamental interest to 
also expand our knowledge on Ru(I) and Ru(III) 
2alkyne com
plexes and thus lay a foundation to either truly excluded or actually 
identify these species in catalysis.5 In this context, Bennett and co
workers set out to prepare the first Ru(III) 
2alkyne complex (B) 
via 1e oxidation of the corresponding Ru(II) derivative (A, see Fig
ure 1).6 Interestingly, an inspection of the RuC distances in 
A and 
B suggested that the alkyne in B is more strongly bound than the al
kyne in A,6 while an opposite trend has been uncovered for closely 
related Ru  2olefine complexes.7 
Considering that no other pair of Ru(II)Ru(III) 
2alkyne com
plexes has been characterized crystallographically in both relevant 
oxidation states, we became interested in corroborating Bennetts 
results by using our (potentially tridentate) 2,2
diphosphinotolane 
scaffold (1P, see Figure 1)8 for the synthesis of Ru(III) 
2alkyne 
complexes.
