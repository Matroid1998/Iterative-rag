Description:
Compounds bearing substitution at the oxygen-bearing carbon.

Text:
However, 
the realization of this plan was elusive due to the lack of a suitable radical acceptor and reliable 
stereocontrol. Recently, we disclosed a Nielectrocatlaytic decarboxylative coupling to access 1,2
amino alcohols bearing substitution at the oxygenbearing carbon leading to unbranched primary 
amino alcohols.24 Applying the same strategy using Seebachtype chiral redox active ester (RAE)
