Description:
A solid matrix used to dilute europium(III) for red emission.

the red emission 
of europium(III) diluted in solid matrix (Eu.Y2O3) by George 
Urbain in the early 1900s, the luminescence of the felements 
has always held a real fascination for the scientific community.1 
This onecentury old enthusiasm is still justified by the very 
particular photophysical properties of these elements which 
show very narrow emission lines originated by the forbidden 
intraatomic ff transitions spread from the visible to the near 
infrared with long excited state lifetimes in the stoms 
range.12 These characteristics have been widely investigated in 
many application areas ranging from material sciences for 
lightning,3 multicolor barcoding4 or displays, to biology for 
imaging58 or immunoassay.911 From a more fundamental point 
of view, the high resolution luminescence, characteristic of the 
symmetry of the coordination sphere (crystalfield splitting), 
can be correlated with other related properties like magnetism 
for instance.1214 However, due to the forbidden character of ff 
transitions, the extinction coefficients are generally very low (1
10 L.mol1.cm1) precluding direct excitation in these 
transitions, in particular for molecular compounds diluted in 
solution.
