Description:
Releases significantly more greenhouse gases than glass bottles and is difficult to reuse.

It is known that plastics as a whole, especially plastic bottles, have a terrible effect on the planet. Unfortunately, many beverages including soda, juice, and milk still come in plastic bottles that
often go to landfills and require a significant amount of energy and processing to be recycled. Aluminum cans also release significantly more greenhouse gases than glass bottles and both
aluminum cans and plastic bottles are difficult to reuse. The efficiency of glass bottles is
exemplified by their high recycling rates, lessintensive manufacturing processes, and minimal
effect on the environment. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of glass
bottles on popular beverages and figure out whether or not they are safe to use.
