To effectively address the adverse effects of NOx pollution, it is crucial
to develop comprehensive monitoring strategies that provide accurate
and realtime data for assessing air quality and guiding targeted miti
gation efforts 15. Therefore, there is a pressing need to invest in the
development of efficient and reliable monitoring techniques to combat
this persistent challenge. In a pursuit to enhance the detection efficiency of NOx, consid
erable efforts have been devoted to exploring novel sensing materi
als, with transitionmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs) emerging as promis
ing candidates. TMDs exhibit unique physicochemical properties 16
20, coupled with an excellent surfacetovolume ratio, rendering them
highly sensitive to molecule adsorption. This sensitivity results in mea
surable changes in their electronic and optical signals.
