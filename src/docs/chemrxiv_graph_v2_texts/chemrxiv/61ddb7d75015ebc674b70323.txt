Description:
Catalyst systems excellent for cross-coupling reactions.

Designing of robust sustainable homogenous catalyst systems rely on several driving 
forces such as high activity at low catalyst loading, broad functional group tolerance and low 
moisture and oxygen sensitivity. Palladiumcarbene catalyst systems are excellent tools for crosscoupling reactions. A wide 
range of catalysts including in situ generated species (e.g. Pd(II)salt and phosphine ligand), 
palladacycles and biscarbene (mostly Nheterocyclic carbene, NHC) structures are recently 
reviewed.13 A special type of Pd(II) halogenidebased, one pyridine and one carbene
containing (socalled PEPPSItype) complexes were reported first by Organ et al. in 2006.4 The 
PEPPSI is originating from the abbreviation of the pyridine enhanced precatalyst preparation 
stabilization and initiation concept. In PEPPSI complexes, the pyridine acts as a throwaway 
ligand meaning that the active palladium species forms upon dissociation of the pyridine.
