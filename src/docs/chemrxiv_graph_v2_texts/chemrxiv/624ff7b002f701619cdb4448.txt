Description:
Used for radiolytic shielding via graphene membranes in liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy.

Liquidphase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) emerged as a cuttingedge in situ 
technique for investigation of processes at the nanoscale.1,2 Particularly in the fields of 
catalysis,3,4 energy materials and storage,57 softmatter studies,8,9 or virology,10,11 LPTEM 
has been enabling unprecedented insights into fundamental processes, such as nonclassical 
crystallization pathways1214 and nanostructure selfassembly.15 
However, inherent inelastic electronmatter interactions influence the Gibbs free energy 
landscape.16,17 To enable LPTEM becoming a standard characterization method this needs to 
be accounted for appropriately. Besides electron beaminduced heating,18,19 radiolysis is a 
crucial factor during LPTEM,2023 even when radical scavengers are utilized24,25 or radiolytic 
shielding via graphene membranes is harnessed.26,27 Moreover, radiochemistry has been 
identified as a prime driving force to study both reductive formation,2830 and oxidative 
etching3135 of metallic nanostructures.
