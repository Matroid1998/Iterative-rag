Description:
Nanoparticles initially oxygen saturated, affecting etching and passivation behavior.

We 
previously reported a study of sublimation and O2 etching of individual Si and SiC nanoparticles 
(NPs), and interestingly, it was found that under etching conditions, the NPs eventually passivated, 
even though the temperature (TNP) and PO2 conditions examined were in the range where bulk Si 
passivation is not observed. This difference in passivation was attributed to the limited volume of 
the NPs, affecting surfacetosubsurface oxygen diffusion. Silica NPs, where the NP volume is 
initially oxygen saturated, provide a different perspective on the etching and passivation behavior 
for Sirich materials, and particularly on the role of subsurface oxygen, and that is the focus of this 
work. There is considerable interest in ultrahigh temperature ceramics (e.g.
