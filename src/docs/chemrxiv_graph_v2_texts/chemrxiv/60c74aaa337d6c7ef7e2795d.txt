Description:
Mediates CH functionalisation reactions for selective transformation of CH bonds on sp3-rich scaffolds.

Text:
Palladiummediated CH functionalisation reactions provide a powerful approach for selective 
transformation of individual CH bonds on sp3rich scaffolds.1 Given the increasing importance of 
these compounds in medicinal chemistry,2 the ability to selectively introduce novel functionality at 
particular locations in the molecular framework could provide a highly useful tool in drug 
development. Building upon pioneering work on the use of stoichiometric quantities of palladium(II) 
salts to mediate selective reactions of CH bonds in sp3rich scaffolds,3 catalytic reactions employing 
a directing group to coordinate to the palladium(II) catalyst to control the site of reaction have proved 
to be especially effective.45 In most cases, the directing group incorporates one or more heteroatoms 
which can act as ligands for the palladium and deliver it to an adjacent CH bond.

Description:
A catalyst delivered to a nearby CH bond via the formation of a palladacycle.

Nitrogenrich 
scaffolds are of particular importance in a wide range of chemistryrelated fields, so nitrogenlinked 
directing groups have been the focus of considerable attention.5 In 2005 Daugulis introduced the 8
aminoquinoline and picolinamide directing groups,5a and since then a number of nitrogenlinked 
directing groups for CH activation have been reported (Figure 1).5 Typically, these directing groups 
deliver the palladium catalyst to a nearby CH bond via the formation of a 5 or 6membered 
palladacycle, though transannular functionalisation reactions have been observed in some cases.5e
