Description:
A heterocyclic terpenoid alkaloid produced by Colobognatha millipedes.

Text:
Millipedes (class Diplopoda) produce a myriad of defensive chemicals, including hydrogen cyanide, oxidized 
aromatics, and alkaloids (Shear 2015). These compounds are stored in high concentrations in ozadenes (or rapidly 
generated from biological inert precursors) and the millipedes discharge the defensive agents upon disturbance. The 
alkaloids are the most structurally intriguing and least studied of all of the millipede defensive secretions, and found 
in one millipede subterclass, the Colobognatha (fungusfeeding millipedes). This subterclass is composed of four 
orders (Platydesmida, Polyzoniida, Siphonocryptida and Siphonophorida) and they are known to produce simple 
monoterpenes (pinenes and limonene), along with various heterocyclic terpenoid alkaloids e.g. deoxybuzonamine 
(1), polyzonimines (2), and gosodesmine (3) (Smolanoff et al. 1975; Shear 2015; Hassler et al. 2020; Jones et al. 2022).
