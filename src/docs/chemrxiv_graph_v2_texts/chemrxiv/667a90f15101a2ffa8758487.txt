Terpenoids are the most widespread and largest class of natural products and have diverse 
biological application ranging from being useful in agriculture, perfume and cosmetic industries 
to pharma industries.16 In nature, terpenoids are produced from common isoprenyl diphosphate 
precursors which are biosynthesized via either the mevalonate (MEV) or the 1deoxyxylulose5
phosphate (DXP) pathway typically in minute quantities in their host systems.710 Sesquiterpene 
hydrocarbons are biosynthesized through conversion of (2E,6E)farnesyl diphosphate (1, FDP) in 
reactions catalyzed by class 1 sesquiterpene synthases.1,11,12 Sesquiterpene synthases catalyze 
some of the most challenging chemical reactions in nature, starting with Mg2dependent 
dephosphorylation of (2E,6E)FDP to give rise to a highly reactive carbocation.1214 This reactive 
carbocation can undergo a cascade of various intramolecular rearrangements that can involve 
several carbocationic andor neutral intermediates and ultimate products are formed by 
deprotonation or H2O attack.1,1518 The main challenge in engineering terpene biosynthesis is 
controlling the intramolecular arrangements of highly reactive carbocations and the final product 
distribution.1921 The final carbocation quench most frequently takes place by proton loss to give 
hydrocarbon terpenes.
