Description:
Improve the proteolytic stability of enkephalin peptide hormones by increasing rigidity.

Text:
In seminal work conducted 3540 years ago, Stammer and coworkers established that ,
dehydroamino acids (AAs) such as Ala, ZPhe, and ZLeu could improve the proteolytic stability 
of the enkephalin peptide hormones.15 This phenomenon can be attributed to the A1,3 strain caused by the 
alkene, which limits the conformational freedom of AAs and increases the rigidity of peptides that 
contain them. This rigidity favors folded states instead of random coil conformations and leads to greater 
stability since folded peptides undergo proteolysis more slowly than unfolded peptides.16 Subsequent to 
Stammers pioneering investigations, Chauhan17,18 and others19 studied the impact of AAs containing 
trisubstituted alkenes (e.g., Phe, Leu) on peptide structure. In general, these residues promote the
