Description:
The longest helicene reported by Fujita et al.

Text:
So far, the longest helicene is a 
16helicene reported by Fujita et al.2 Alternatively, multiply fused helicenes have been 
reported and many of them show improved chiroptical properties as compared to their 
single helicene counterparts.3 Another way is to increase the size of a helicene by 
alternation of the linear and angular ring fusion, the socalled expanded helicenes 
approach (Figure 1a).4 Such expansion could enhance the chiroptical properties due to 
more extended conjugation and modulation of the frontier molecular orbital symmetry 
and transition moments.5 Synthesis of expanded helicenes is also challenging and several 
expanded helicenes have been reported in recent years by different synthetic methods 
(Figure 1b).
