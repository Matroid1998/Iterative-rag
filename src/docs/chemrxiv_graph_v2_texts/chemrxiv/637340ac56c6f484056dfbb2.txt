Description:
Species that can be transformed into an array of functional groups and serve as a robust handle for subsequent CC bond couplings.

LSF methods in medicinal chemistry include
fluorination, amination, arylation, methylation, trifluo
romethylation, borylation, acylation, and oxidation. 7
Among these methods, CH borylation is considered
the most versatile for rapid compound diversification. Organoboron species can be transformed into an array
of functional groups and serve as a robust handle for
subsequent CC bond couplings (Figure 1), which en
ables broad SAR studies. 810
Figure 1
Latestage borylation of a drug molecule. The example illustrates monoborylated Loratadine
(1a), which can be accessed through borylation of the
drug Loratadine (1). Borylation provides the oppor
tunity for rapid and broad diversification, aiming to
study structureactivity relationships (SAR) and im
prove pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties. Note
The eight potential postfunctionalization modifications
shown in this Figure serve for demonstration purposes
only.
