Description:
Has significant emission intensities with bands at 750 nm and 825 nm.

Text:
The lanthanide(III) ions are characterized by narrow bands in the optical spectra, and by emission ranging from the 
ultraviolet to the nearinfrared (NIR). While the visible region is characterized by high emission intensities and good 
instrumentation, spectra including the bands in the NIR suffer from poor data quality.1, 2 A typical example is the two 
last bands in the Eu(III) spectrum at 750 nm and 825 nm. These are rarely reported, despite having significant 
intensities.38 Investigating lanthanide(III) ions that only have emission bands in the NIR are further complicated as 
their bands are weak in regions where only insensitive instrumention with high noise levels are available. Weak 
emission in the NIR is due to efficient quenching, a fact with a generalised explanation given by the energy gab law.
