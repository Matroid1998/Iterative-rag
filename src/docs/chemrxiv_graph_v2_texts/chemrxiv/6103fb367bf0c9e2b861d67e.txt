Description:
Used as the photoanode material in n-type dye-sensitized solar cells.

The eective and ecient conversion of solar energy into electrical energy is challenging but
might enable a signicant reduction of the carbon emission in the world which will even have
a benecial economic impact.1 The market of solar cells is still dominated by siliconbased
photovoltaic devices.24 However, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC)5 have the potential to
become an alternative to siliconbased solar cells, as they are associated with a very low
weight, low costs, ease of production, and can be used in a more exible manner than the
conventional siliconbased technology.610
In general, there are two kinds of DSSCs, i.e. ntype and ptype. In ntype DSSCs,
the electrons are injected from the dye to the photoanode (mainly TiO2).
