Description:
Used as a renewable feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction or further electrochemically converted to multicarbon products.

through CO2RR is still challenging in terms of selectivity and efficiency,13 such products can be obtained 
through a tandem system where CO2 is reduced to CO, and CO subsequently employed as a renewable feedstock 
for the FischerTropsch reaction or further electrochemically converted to multicarbon products.4,5 CO2 
reduction to CO involves only two electrons and two proton transfers; the state of the art catalysts for the reaction 
are based on Au and Ag.6,7, first reported by Hori and coworkers.8
