Description:
A mineral constituent of oil sand tailings.

Text:
Silica and kaolinite minerals are both highly abundant in various geochemical systems. Hence, understanding their interactions is often key to improving the efficiency of mineral 
processing including the treatment of mining waste materials such as oil sand tailings that are 
mixtures of mineral oxides, clays, ions and residual organics that retain substantial amounts of 
water even after initial settling.1 For example, the mineral constituents of tailings from the 
Athabascan oil sands in northern Alberta consist primarily of silica and kaolinite,12 so studying 
their interactions in the presence of other tailings components can aid in tailings treatment.

Description:
One of the most abundant mineral oxides in the Earth's crust that develops a negative surface charge when immersed in aqueous electrolytes above pH.

Silica, 
one of the most abundant mineral oxides in the Earths crust, develops a negative surface charge 
when immersed in aqueous electrolytes above pH 23.3 Kaolinite, a ubiquitous clay mineral in 
both natural and engineered materials such as soils, cement, and pharmaceuticals,47 consists of 
alternating gibbsite (alumina) and silica layers.8 The surface charge and particleparticle 
interactions of both silica and kaolinite minerals are dependent on the bulk solution conditions 
such as pH, ionic strength, and ion identity.

Description:
Influences chemical reactivity, adsorption behavior, dissolution, and settling and flocculation.

Text:
Hence, tuning the chemistry of silica and kaolinite
containing systems can significantly alter the surface chemistry, influencing chemical reactivity, 
adsorption behavior, dissolution, and settling and flocculation.913 
Typical methods to understand interactions between different minerals and clays involve 
monitoring heterocoagulation using methods that evaluate particle size or charge as well as 
methods based on microscopy to image coagulation.1418 Regarding silica and kaolinite 
specifically, Li et al. used focused beam reflectance measurements sensitive to particle size 
distribution and observed that silica and kaolinite flocculated at pH 7 but formed stable dispersions
