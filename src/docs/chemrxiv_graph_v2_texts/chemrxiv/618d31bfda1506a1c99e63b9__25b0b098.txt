Description:
Functionally diverse nonracemic compounds important for chemical synthesis.

Furthermore, the welldefined exit 
vectors of these rigid cycloalkanes make them ideal as scaffold can
didates through which to probe distinct spatial environments, par
ticularly through their deployment as single enantiomers.2 As a result 
of these properties, the preparation of functionally diverse nonrace
mic aminomethylcyclopropanes (AMCPs) and aminomethylcy
clobutanes (AMCBs) represents an important challenge for chemi
cal synthesis.
