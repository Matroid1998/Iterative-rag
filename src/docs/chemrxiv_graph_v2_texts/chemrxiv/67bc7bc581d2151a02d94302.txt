Description:
Present in small amounts as a current collector in black mass from end-of-life LIBs.

Another valuable component of endoflife LIBs is 
graphite (anode) which has been classified as a critical raw 
material.4 It accounts for 40  of LIBs by weight and recycling 
graphite has also gained traction recently.5 Recycling endoflife 
LIBs usually begins with the preparation of black mass, which is 
produced by safely discharging, shredding, grinding, and then 
milling the endoflife LIBs.6 Black mass (BM), a fine powder, 
contains valuables such as Li, Ni, Mn, Co, graphite, and small 
amounts of Al and Cu current collectors. Material characterization 
techniques are significant 
in 
developing sustainable and efficient pretreatment and 
recycling processes for endoflife LIBs.
