Description:
An RNA nucleobase analog used as an antiviral drug.

The development of therapeutic medicines against the newly pathogenic severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) is desired considering the current COVID19 
pandemic.1 However, developing a highly efficient antiviral drug against a new virus in which 
virustype mutations occur frequently or whose characteristics are unknown properties is 
difficult. Therefore, using existing antiviral drugs with a broad spectrum and certain 
effectiveness for various viruses is currently the first choice for effective drug therapy. To 
identify a promising candidate drug to treat viral infection, especially for influenza, hepatitis C, 
and now COVID19, several RNA nucleobase analogs such as remdesivir,2,3 ribavirin,4 
brincidofovir,5 and favipiravir 6fluoro3hydroxypyrazine2carboxamide (favipiravir, T705), 
sold under the brand name avigan,6 have been developed.
