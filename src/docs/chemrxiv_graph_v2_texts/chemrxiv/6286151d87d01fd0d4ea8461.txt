Description:
A gas eliminated during the photochemical irradiation of diazirines.

Text:
and Aim. Aliphatic diazirines (type A, Figure 1) 
were discovered first in the 1960s by Abendroth with Henrich;1 
Paulsen;2 and Schmitz with Ohme.3 Their thermal decomposition 
was originally studied as an approach to carbenes.4 Photochemical 
irradiation of diazirines also leads to the elimination of nitrogen 
and the formation of carbenes.5 The latter can insert at the CH 
and NH, CH, SH bonds to crosslink with proximal species.
