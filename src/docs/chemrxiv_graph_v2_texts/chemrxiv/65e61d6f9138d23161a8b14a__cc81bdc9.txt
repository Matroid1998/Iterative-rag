Description:
Its hydrogen bonding with water affects vibrational frequencies and band intensities.

Text:
The formation of hydrogen bonds (H
bonds) between chromophore and solvent can blueshift
or redshift peaks in the optical spectrum.31,32 Re
cent studies have examined how Hbonding of water
to flavin affects the vibrational frequencies33 and band
intensities.34 One advantage of a trajectorybased ap
proach is that changes in excitation energy and energy
fluctuations can be connected to specific chromophore
solvent interactions and even solvent dynamics.
