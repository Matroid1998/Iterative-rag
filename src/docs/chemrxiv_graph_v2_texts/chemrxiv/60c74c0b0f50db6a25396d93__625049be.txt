Reagents used for the removal of dithianes.

The 
use 
of 
hypervalentiodine reagents for the removal of 
dithianes has been also reported as an efficient 
process using periodic acid,10 diacetoxyiodobenzene, 
11 bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene (BTI),12 Dess
Martin periodinane13 and Nhalosuccinimides.14 
However, a large variety of the aforementioned 
methods require the use of toxic metals, the need of 
oxidizing species in large amounts sometimes 
accompanied with cooxidants mainly in harsh 
reaction conditions. In this context, we believe that an 
alternative milder process is still needed using for 
example inexpensive and soft reagents to achieve this 
transformation at room temperature in the presence of 
various functional groups. Recently, we reported the interesting reducing 
properties of the TMSClNaI association in CH2Cl2 
towards various functional groups as unsymmetrical 
diketones,15 ketoesters,16 and hydrazonesError! Bookmark not defined. derivatives.
