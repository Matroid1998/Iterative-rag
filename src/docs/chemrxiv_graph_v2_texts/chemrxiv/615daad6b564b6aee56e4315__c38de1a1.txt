Description:
Has an absorption spectrum in the UV region with an onset at 267 nm.

One of the most promising MOST systems is the norbornadienequadricyclane (NBDQC)
couple (Figure 1), which was introduced as a potential MOST system in 1961 by Dauben
and Cargill,14 although the isomerization reaction of a NBDQC dicarboxylic acid system
was already observed in 1954 by Cristol and Snell.15,16 Since then, the system has been ex
tensively studied due to its high energy density of almost 1 MJkg, which is estimated to be
the fundamental upper limit of MOST systems and comparable to Liion batteries.7
However, the absorption spectrum of NBD lies in the UV region with absorption onset at
267 nm, and has therefore no overlap with the spectrum of solar radiation.12 Several studies
have shown that it is possible to obtain a large redshift in the absorption spectrum and bet
ter quantum yield, but at the expense of a decrease in the energy density due to the added
weight of the chromophore.1724 For example, in a recent perspective OrregoHernndez et
al.24 highlight seven examples of NBD systems with absorption onsets of 362466 nm, but
energy densities of 0.100.56 MJkg  compared to 0.97 MJkg for unsubstituted NBD.
