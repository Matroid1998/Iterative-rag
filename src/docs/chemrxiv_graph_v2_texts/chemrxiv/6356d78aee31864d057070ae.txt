Description:
Precursors for depositing thiolate SAMs on metallic surfaces.

Text:
Metallic substrates modified by thiolatebased selfassembled monolayers 
(SAMs) have been used in diverse technological applications including molecular 
electronics, biotechnology, and for modification of various surface properties.1,2 
They have also been used to modify reactivity and selectivity toward thermo and 
electrochemical catalyzed surface reactions.39 Thiolate SAMs can be deposited 
on different metallic surfaces by gasphase or liquidphase adsorption of 
precursors such as thiols, disulfides, or thioalkoxide salt solutions. It has been 
shown that the final (equilibrium) saturation coverage and corresponding SAM 
structure do not depend on the preparation method.10 Thus, on a perfectly flat 
and defectfree surface, the configuration of a SAM tends toward a dense, 
organized upright arrangement as the thiol concentrationdose or adsorption time 
increases.
