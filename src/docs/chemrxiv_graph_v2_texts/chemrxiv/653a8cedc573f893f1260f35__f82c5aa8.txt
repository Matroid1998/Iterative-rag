Description:
Highly active nucleophiles used in nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Nickelcatalyzed CC crosscoupling reactions have expanded the field of synthetic 
chemistry and enabled new methods for constructing molecular skeletons.14 In recent years, a 
variety of Nicatalyzed CC crosscoupling reactions, such as KumadaCorriu, SuzukiMiyaura, 
Negishi, MizorokiHeck, and reductive crosselectrophile coupling reactions, have been 
developed and applied in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and natural products.58 Despite the 
significant success of Nicatalyzed CC crosscoupling reactions, these methodologies still suffer 
from several wellknown limitations, including the use of highly active nucleophiles (such as 
Grignard reagents and organozinc reagents), sacrificial reductants, sensitive precatalysts (such as 
bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)), and sometimes elevated reaction temperatures.1,2,6,9 There remains 
significant interest in developing Nicatalyzed CC crosscoupling reactions with mild conditions, 
using readily available and affordable substrates, and benchstable reagents and catalysts.
