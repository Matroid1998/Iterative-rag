Description:
Frequently cation-mixed and poorly diffracting, requiring alternative metrologies to study their atomic environments.

Bismuthate glasses are
nontoxic candidates to replace lead oxide in zerostress optic materials.26,27 The
stereochemically active lone pair in Bi3 can lead to noncentrosymmetric structures with
useful optoelectronic and ferroic properties.2832
Given the range of technological applications and frequently cationmixed andor
poorly diffracting nature of bismuth and indium oxides, it is desirable to develop alternative
metrologies to study their atomic environments. 115In and 209Bi solidstate nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could, in principle, offer additional insights into the local
coordination, symmetry, and ionicpolyhedral dynamics.
