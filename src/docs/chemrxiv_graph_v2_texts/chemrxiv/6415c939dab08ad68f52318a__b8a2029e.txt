Description:
A ternary phase structurally characterized to adopt the TiAl3Ge structure type.

Text:
One interesting example 
is Gd3CoNi (C2m, mS20, 12), where the site preference between the neighbouring Ni and Co is 
intriguing; Co selectively occupies one of the two independent Nisites of binary Gd3Ni2, and at the 
limiting ternary composition, ordering between Co and Ni is observed, which significantly modifies 
the magnetic properties 4. On the other hand, Cd2Cu3In is an ordered substituent variant space 
group P4132 (213) of the cubic MgCu2type Laves phase, where ordering between the proximate 
Cd and In is noteworthy 5. While investigating the ternary CuZnSb system, a ternary phase Cu6Zn2Sb2 was first identified by 
D. Mini et al. 6, later it was structurally characterized by Misra et. al. According to their reports, 
it adopts the TiAl3Ge structure type P4nmm, tP10, 129 7.

Description:
Has a homogeneity range that was investigated.

Text:
The 10 atoms in the unit cell are 
distributed among four independent crystallographic sites, with the neighbouring Cu and Zn being 
perfectly ordered in nature. While investigating the homogeneity range of Cu6Zn2Sb2, two different 
compositions were further explored, i.e. Cu5.5 Zn2.5Sb2 and Cu5Zn3Sb2, where Zn selectively chooses
