Description:
A subgroup involved in unconventional luminophores with intrinsic photoluminescence.

Text:
In recent decades, intrinsic photoluminescence (PL) from unconventional 
luminophores in absence of any traditional conjugated luminophores nor aromatic 
motifs has been demonstrated.1, 2 In general, these unconventional luminophors involve 
certain subgroups, such as alkene (CC), cyano (CN), carbonyl (CO), hydroxyl (
OH), acylamino (NHCO).1, 35 Although the corresponding emission mechanism 
remains an open question, it is generally accepted that the emission of these 
unconventional luminophores is attributed to the aggregation of nonconjugated 
chromophores (clusteringtriggered emission, CTE).2, 619 In particular, among the 
emerging luminescent materials, nonconjugated luminescent polymers (NCLPs) 
synthesized from nonluminescent monomers have aroused increasing interest because 
of their significant fundamental importance and promising technical applications.20, 21 
Taking advantage of nonconjugated polymeric materials, such as ease of synthesis, 
high processability, good biocompatibility, and environmental degradation, NCLPs 
have great potential for applications in bioimaging, anticounterfeiting, and biosensors, 
etc.1, 7, 18, 19, 2226 
Based on the CTE mechanism, to achieve NCLPs from nonluminescent 
monomers, several factors need to be fulfilled.
