Polysiloxanes, a class of polymers with the general formula R2SiOn, where R can be a vari
ety of organic groups, are renowned for their unique properties of thermal stability, low glass
transition temperatures, and biocompatibility. These properties render them indispensable
in a wide range of industrial and medical applications, including sealants, adhesives, and
medical implants.16 To enhance the performance of polysiloxanebased materials and to
tailor their properties for specific applications, a detailed understanding of their physical
properties is essential. Traditionally, these properties are determined experimentally, which
can be timeconsuming and costly. Computational methods, particularly molecular simula
tions, offer an attractive alternative, providing a means of predicting properties under a wide
