Description:
A residue that is specific for bioconjugation reactions in peptides and proteins.

Residuespecific reactions that enable the siteselective incorporation of artificial units into 
peptidesproteins have advanced research relevant to a variety of biological and biomedical disciplines 
that involve peptideprotein molecules.1 Such reactions include bioconjugations specific to cysteine 
(Cys) and tryptophan (Trp), which are both low in relative abundance in proteins.
