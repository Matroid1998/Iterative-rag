Description:
Has a centrosymmetric planar hexagonal crystal structure and is nonferroelectric and nonpiezoelectric.

However, a degra
dation in the ferroelectric response has been reported
for B concentrations above 15. Unlike AlN, BN has a
centrosymmetric planar hexagonal crystal structure, and
therefore hBN is nonFE and nonpiezoelectric. In this
mda.alamtyndall.ie; michael.nolantyndall.ie
paper we pose the research question can substitution of
boron by another trivalent element be used to engineer
ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in hBN by breaking
its centrosymmetry? hBN is a layered material with high thermal and
chemical stability, widely used as dielectric substrate
and protective coating layers in 2D materials based
devices3, 10 e.g. graphenehBN FET11. Due to
its van der Waals layered structure, hBN can be syn
thesized as fewlayer or even singlelayer sheets.
