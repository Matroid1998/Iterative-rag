Description:
A chemically diverse set of compounds that play a role in cell membrane composition and function.

Text:
Cell membranes comprise a chemically diverse set of phos
pholipids.1 In bacteria and eukaryotes, cell membranes are 
made predominantly of complex phospholipids bearing 2
amino alcohol motifs (e.g. choline, ethanolamine, and serine), 
the compositional and functional diversity of which influence 
their properties, including protein binding, substrate transport, 
and cell signalling.2 Due to their ubiquitous role in compart
mentalization, phospholipids are thought to have appeared on 
Earth before the advent of cells capable of Darwinian evolu
tion.3,4 Still, prebiotic synthetic pathways that could have led to 
the diverse array of phospholipids present in modern mem
branes remain largely unexplored.

Description:
Enhance the stability of fatty acid-based membranes to pH and divalent cations.

Text:
Mixtures of singlechain amphiphiles (e.g., fatty acids, alco
hols, and aldehydes) form membranebound compartments un
der prebiotically plausible conditions.57 However, their sensi
tivity to metal ions8 restricts their ability to host Mg2driven 
RNA polymerisation9 and Fedriven protometabolic pro
cesses,10,11 and suggests that complex phospholipids were likely 
needed for the emergence of robust primitive cells.3,4 Notably, 
phospholipids enhance the stability of fatty acidbased mem
branes to pH and divalent cations,1214 but such blended mem
branes do not host the compositional diversity of phospholipids 
nor mirror the functional capabilities exhibited by modern 
membranes.

Description:
Compounds that can be synthesized prebiotically and include self-assembling (lyso)phosphatidic acids.

Text:
Only a few routes have been described for the prebiotic syn
thesis of phospholipids.15 For instance, activation of mixtures of 
fatty acids and glycerol phosphates gives rise to selfassembling 
(lyso)phosphatidic acids, the simplest of phospholipids.3,6,1618 
However, pathways leading to more complex phospholipids 
(e.g., phosphatidylcholines) remain scarce.
