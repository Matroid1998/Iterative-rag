Description:
A model coreshell system with anatase and rutile used in photoelectrochemical splitting of water and photocatalysis.

Text:
The extensive exploitation of Degussa P25 (TiO2) for studies in photoelectrochemical splitting of water and photocatalysis has to be 
rationalized even though, the objective of its use in reported studies is mainly for comparison purpose. Its remarkable reproducibility has 
to be recognized. It is presumed that P25 is a model coreshell system with anatase and rutile (41 weight ratio) and possibly the relative 
thickness of the core and shell of this system is most appropriate for its behaviour as a photocatalyst. It is necessary that one recognizes 
15 
the relative values of surface energy of the polymorphs of TiO2in order to recognize the type of core shell configuration this system can 
adopt.

Description:
A compound that can be doped with hetero atoms like C, N, and S to shift photon absorption to the visible region.

Text:
Another aspect of the studies on TiO2 deals with doping with hetero atoms like C, N, S and others, in these studies it has been reported 
that the reason for doping with these elements is to shift the photon absorption to visible region. This aspect has been examined recently 
30 
in a review8. These studies must be considered in the light of the observations recorded that the coexistence of Rutile and Anatase 
phases and the depth of Rutile core and Anatase shell can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of TiOxCy (x  y) and TiOxCy (x  y) in 
the precursor composite by a change of the calcinations temperature1.
