Description:
Has a high mass-based energy density and produces only water as a combustion byproduct in a fuel cell engine.

Hydrogen (H2) has a high massbased energy density1 and 
produces only water (H2O) as a combustion byproduct in a fuel 
cell engine. On this basis, H2 is considered one of the most im
portant fuels in any future net zero carbon society. At present, 
natural gas reforminggasification is widely used to produce H2 
because it is the most efficient and least expensive approach. However, this process is neither cost effective nor environmen
tally friendly.2,3 As an alternative, pure H2 (also referred to as 
green H2) can be obtained from H2O via electrocatalytic tech
niques.
