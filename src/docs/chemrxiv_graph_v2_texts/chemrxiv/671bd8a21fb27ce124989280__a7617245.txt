Description:
A chemical compound that can store free energy and release it through exothermic reactions without emitting greenhouse gases.

Text:
Increasing energy demand due to population and industrial growth is rapidly depleting the 
limited resources available worldwide. Most of the global energy demand is met by using fossil 
fuels due to their high energy density. However, the excessive use of these fuels leads to climate 
change, as they release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Using 
renewable sources like solar energy can mitigate the dependence on fossil fuels and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. However, solar energy is an intermittent energy resource, and thus 
cannot provide a consistent supply, matching with our current energy consumption practices. However, free energy can be stored within the chemical bonds of chemical compounds such as 
hydrogen, and controllably released through exothermic reactions without emitting greenhouse 
gases 1.

Description:
Produced in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during PEC water splitting.

Text:
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology to generate and store 
green energy as it directly converts solar energy into chemical energy by splitting water into 
hydrogen and oxygen. The PEC water splitting process consists of two halfreactions the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER), occurring through a fourelectron process in the photoanode, and the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), occurring through a twoelectron process in the photocathode 
2. The OER is the key limiting step in the PEC water splitting since it is mechanistically more 
complex and associated with higher overpotentials than the HER. Therefore, a lot of scientific 
effort has been devoted to developing more efficient photoanode materials 35. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a widely used photoanode material in PEC water splitting, 
recognized for its exceptional properties.
