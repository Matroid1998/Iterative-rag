Description:
Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that cisCH3ONO is energetically stabilized relative to transCH3ONO.

Text:
We propose that the surface formation 
dynamics of N2 change with the angle of deposition, affecting the conformer abundance. Quantum 
chemistry calculations of N2CH3ONO also indicate that cisCH3ONO is energetically stabilized 
relative to transCH3ONO. Quantum chemistry calculations of XCH3ONO (X  Ar, Xe) do not
