Description:
Rigid physisorbents that tend to suffer from inappropriate sorption isotherms, resulting in lower working capacity than saturation uptake.

New approaches to gas storagedelivery are needed in the age 
of gas to address the large energy footprint associated with 
existing technologies such as compressed or liquefied gas 
storage.1 Whereas physisorption holds promise for greatly 
improving the energy efficiency of industrial gas storage, it does 
not yet meet the prerequisites for practical deployment such as 
adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage.2 This is at least partly 
because rigid physisorbents such as zeolites tend to suffer from 
inappropriate sorption isotherms (Langmuir or type I3), 
resulting in lower working capacity than the saturation uptake 
(Scheme 1a).4 
Metalorganic materials (MOMs),5,6 such as metalorganic 
frameworks 
(MOFs)7,8, 
or 
porous 
coordination 
polymersnetworks (PCPsPCNs),912 have attracted attention 
from academic and industrial researchers thanks to their 
potential utility in the areas as broad as storage, separation and 
catalysis.13,14 A prominent feature of MOMs is their inherent 
modularity which enables fine tuning of structures through 
crystal engineering or reticular chemistry.15,16 However, 
although ca.
