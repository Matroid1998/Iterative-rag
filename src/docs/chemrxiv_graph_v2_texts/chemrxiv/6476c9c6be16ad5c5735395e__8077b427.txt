Description:
Prepared from compound 2a.

Text:
As a representative procedure, the synthetic route for 3a is illustrated in Scheme 2. In accordance 
with our previous report, 1hydroxy9methoxydibenzoj,lfluoranthene (2b) was synthesised from the 
corresponding biaryl ketone 1b. After triflation of 2b, Pdcatalysed reduction of the resulted 5 in the 
presence of Et3SiH, followed by demethylation using BBr3, afforded 9hydroxyfluoranthene 3a. Compounds 2c and 3b,c were also synthesised from the common substrate 2b. Methyl ether 4 was 
also prepared from 2a. The chromic properties of hydroxyfluoranthenes 2a and 3a were analysed by UVvis and 
fluorescence spectroscopy under neutral, basic, and acidic conditions in CH2Cl2 solution (Figure 2). The absorption spectrum of 1hydroxy 2a exhibited two major bands at 400 nm (moderate) and 420
500 nm (broad, weak) under neutral conditions (Figure 2a).

Description:
Exhibits almost the same absorption spectra both in the absence or presence of DBU or TFA.

Text:
It was clearly proved that almost 
the same absorption spectra was observed for methyl ether 4 both in the absence or presence of DBU 
or TFA (Figure 2c). Interestingly, the chromic properties of 9hydroxy derivative 3a were different 
from those of 1hydroxy derivative 2a. Although 3a exhibits major bands at 400 nm (moderate) and 
410530 nm (broad, weak) under neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, the absorption at longer 
wavelengths is redshifted to 420630 nm upon titration with DBU. The bathochromic shift was 
saturated with the addition of 30 equivalents of DBU (Figure 2d). The colour of the solution turned
