Description:
A moiety unexpectedly produced during fermentation.

Text:
However, 
during the second round of fermentation, compound 1 was 
unexpectedly produced, featuring a pyroglutamic acid moiety instead 
of the glutamic acid moiety observed in 2, despite the absence of 2 
under the same conditions. Although we screened various fermentation 
parameters including pH levels and growth medium composition, 1 was 
not produced repeatedly in our experimental system.
