Description:
Used as C-source precursors in SiC CVD processes.

Text:
The addition of Cl to the SiC CVD processes has been reported to not only increase 
the growth rate but also prevent the formation of Si droplets in the gas phase. The stronger 
SiCl bonds (400 kJmol)3 can suppress the formation of weaker SiSi bonds (226 kJmol)3,4. In 
terms of the Csource precursor, branched and small hydrocarbons such as ethylene or 
propane are often used since they can produce highquality SiC coatings and are available at 
high purities. As in many polycrystalline materials, the physical and chemical properties of 3CSiC 
coatings are dependent on the crystalline orientation. It has been shown that the Vickers 
microhardness of 111oriented 3CSiC films, i.e. films in which the (111) planes were 
aligned parallel to the surface, was higher than those 110oriented5.

Description:
Compounds used in CVD processes affecting the growth orientation of 3CSiC coatings.

Text:
The (110) and (111) 
planes are the two planes in 3CSiC with the lowest surface energy; 3.4 Jm2 and 4.2 Jm2, 
respectively 6. In the SiCl4based 3CSiC CVD processes, the preferred growth orientation of 
resultant coatings varies with the selection of hydrocarbons as well as the deposition 
conditions. It was reported that using CH4 as carbon source, highly 111oriented 3CSiC can 
be produced either at T  1200 , ptot  4 kPa7 or at 1200  T  1500 , ptot  40 kPa8. On the 
other hand, at T 1450 , ptot  1 kPa or at T  1450 , ptot  10 kPa, highly 110oriented 
3CSiC was obtained8.
