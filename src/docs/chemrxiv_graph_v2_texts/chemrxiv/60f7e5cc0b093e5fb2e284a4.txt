Description:
Functional groups that can be attached to cyclopentene in quinonelike molecules.

Text:
This is typically performed by decorating ring 
positions on quinonelike backbone structures with various functional groups2124 andor by 
substituting the carbon atoms in the rings with heterocyclic atoms,25 with an aim to tune the relevant 
properties of the core molecule. These efforts have not only led to the discovery of new molecules that 
can potentially perform better than the best experimentally validated quinones,21,23 but they also have 
elucidated molecular design principles that are crucial for the further optimizations of the desired 
properties of the electroactive molecules.23 It must be noted that reversible electrochemical behavior 
can also be found in quinonelike molecules in which the carbonyl pairs are attached on cyclopentene
