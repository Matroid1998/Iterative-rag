Description:
Polymers with SiOSi bound backbones that are thermally stable, chemically inert, and highly flexible.

Text:
Silicone polymers are widely used in applications ranging 
from lubricants, construction  automotive materials, 
electronics, medical formulations  engineered materials.1,2 In 
2020, the worlds production of silicones was over 8 million 
tons, representing a market value at 15.1 billion USD.3 Silicone 
polymers consist of SiOSi bound highly resistant backbones. SiO bonds are longer than CO bonds and the bond angle for Si
OSi is wider than that in carbon analogues. These materials are 
thus thermally stable, mostly chemically inert (except to strong 
acids and bases) and highly flexible.3 Recycling of these high
value inorganic polymers has become strategic for both 
environmental and economic reasons. Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) is one of the most important 
silicone products.

Description:
Materials that are recycled through mechanical processing or limited chemical recycling.

Text:
The recycling of silicone polymers and materials remains 
limited 
and 
principally 
involves 
downcycling 
through 
mechanical processing (powdered waste elastomers for 
instance) or limited chemical recycling.10,11 Most of the chemical 
recycling methods and associated industrial processes rely on a 
rather high catalytic amount (thus questioning the efficient 
catalysis) of alkaline hydroxides,11 or strong organic and 
inorganic acids12,13 and the reaction conditions as well as 
separation steps of the processes mandate high temperatures 
and low pressures, to recover valuable cyclic monomers.11 
There is thus a dire need of catalysis upgrading to allow for a 
wider implementation of silicone chemical recycling.

Description:
Used in the industry for PDMS-based cyclics recycling.

Text:
Recycling to 
recover PDMSbased cyclics, the shortest cycle within the 
silicone industry, remains highly desirable, and lacks very 
competitive catalyts to become viable on very large scales. In 1997, Allandrieu and Cardinaud have found that strong 
alkaline hydroxides or quaternary ammoniumbased hydroxide 
could be used as an efficient catalyst for the depolymerisation
