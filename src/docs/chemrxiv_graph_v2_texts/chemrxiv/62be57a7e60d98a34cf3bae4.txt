Description:
Provides analgesic and euphoric effects in fermented beverages.

Text:
Fermented beverages have been consumed since the emergence of civilisation. The earliest evidence of 
purposeful production and consumption of fermented beverages dates back as early as 7000 BC in 
China 1 and 60005800 BC in Georgia 2. Although fermentation has used diverse microorganisms 
throughout history, yeasts have been and still are by far the most widely used microorganism in the 
production of fermented beverages 3,4. It is likely that the first fermented beverages were made fortuitously due to spontaneous fermentation 
by microbial contaminants during storage of surplus goods. The benefits of fermentation, including new 
sensory properties, tastes, aromas, mouthfeel, the analgesic and euphoric effects of ethanol, and 
protection from further contamination by pathogenic microbes may have triggered systematic efforts to 
replicate and optimise fermentation 5,6.
