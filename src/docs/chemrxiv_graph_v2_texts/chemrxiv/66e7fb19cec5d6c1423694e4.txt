Description:
Anions that coordinate with cations in the perovskite structure to form octahedra.

Text:
Perovskites1 are a promising materials class2 for energyrelated 
applications and key to future catalysis technologies.2b 
Applications 
of 
perovskite 
oxides 
include 
environmental 
catalysis3 and electrocatalysis.2b Due to the high flexibility of the 
perovskite structure in terms of composition, an immense number 
of compounds can be obtained by combining different elements 
in ABO3 materials and by varying the stoichiometry, e.g., in AB(1
x)BxO3 or A(1x)AxBO3 systems. In the perovskite structure, 
relatively large A cations (e.g., lanthanides) occupy sites that are 
coordinated with 12 oxygen anions (O2) and smaller B cations 
(e.g., transition metals) are coordinated with 6 oxygen anions to 
form BO6 cornersharing octahedra.

Description:
Acts as an oxidizing agent in the oxidation of CO to CO2.

Text:
This prevents the explicit, atomistic modelling 
of the full catalytic progression.5 Indeed, the surface motifs that 
are present under reaction conditions and the reaction 
mechanisms that operate on those surfaces are typically 
unknown and continuously adapt to the progress of the reaction 
and the associated changes in chemical potential. The CO oxidation to CO2 by molecular oxygen is an example of 
an important reaction for environmental catalysis and for the 
purification of hydrogen for energy generation.6 This reaction can 
be catalyzed by perovskite oxides.3, 
67 However, the 
mechanisms operating on perovskites are not well understood.

Description:
Involved in the transfer to reacting species and redox processes on B sites.

Text:
The performance has been related to different underlying 
processes, such as the transfer of lattice oxygen to reacting 
species and the redox processes occurring on B sites.8 
Accordingly, the activity was correlated to the perovskite capacity 
to provide lattice oxygen and to the abundance and redox 
potential of surface B species. Additionally, the choice of the A 
element can result in crystallographic strain9 and thus in 
deviations from the ideal cubic perovskite structure, which can in 
turn affect the surface properties and catalytic performance.10 In
