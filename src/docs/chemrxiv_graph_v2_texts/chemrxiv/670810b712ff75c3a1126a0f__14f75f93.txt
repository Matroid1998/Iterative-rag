The structure of its assemblies has been debated.

that
the
interaction
parameters
between
the
tail,
headgroup,
and solvent are rather large,
the micellar
structure is wellsegregated into distinct core and shell
regions. 8 For more weakly interacting systems 13,14 or
micelles in mixed solvents 15, however, significant solvent
penetration into the core is found, a feature which can be
utilised for micellar catalysis. 16

Figure 1. Molecular structure of a) C12EO10 and b) TX100. The
micelles formed by C12EO10 are known to be quite regular and
have defined core and shell regions, while the structure of TX100
assemblies has been debated.
