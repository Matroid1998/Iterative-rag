More recently, AC electrolysis, where the flow of charge 
periodically changes direction, started to gain interest in the 
organic synthesis community.1321 One of the experimen
tally observed properties of AC electrolysis is its ability to 
reduce overoxidationreduction products without using 
any mediators relative to its direct current (DC) counter
part.18 For example, Sattler et al.15 demonstrated that AC 
electrolysis solved the problem of the overoxidation of di
sulfides to oxo species and overreduction of disulfides to 
unidentified black precipitate in synthesizing unsymmet
rical disulfides by an electrochemical sulfursulfur bond 
metathesis reaction. More recently, Kawamata et al.22 pre
sented a unique chemoselective reduction of phthalimides 
to partially reduced hemiaminal or fully reduced lactam by 
applying different AC waveforms, which cannot be achieved 
by DC electrolysis, either.
