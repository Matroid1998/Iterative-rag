Play a vital role in photosynthesis due to strong absorption in the visible region and adjustable chemical structures.

High 
electronic excitation energy of porphyrinoid systems 
(2.0 eV) influences a strong exergonic electron 
transfer that successively mediates the conversion 
between light and electrical chemical energy 10. Porphyrins play a vital role in photosynthesis due to 
their strong absorption in the visible region, and the 
ease of adjusting their chemical structures. Porphyrins 
are wide class of materials, which are extensively 
studied for their role in electron transfer phenomenon 
in photosynthesis, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), 
etc. In order to develop organic photovoltaic cells and 
artificial photosynthetic systems, photoinduced energy 
transfer and electron transfer processes have been 
widely studied in porphyrin based donoracceptor (D
A) molecular systems 1116. In our present study, we 
have selected octaethylporphyrin (OEP) as donor and 
2nitrofluorene (2NF) as an acceptor in acetonitrile 
polar solvent.
