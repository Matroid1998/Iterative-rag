Description:
Demonstrates a strong preference for cofacial stacking.

Text:
The benzene dimer has long been studied by quantum
chemists as an example of a  stacking interaction,111
although its archetypal status in that regard has been
questioned,10 because complexes of larger polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, starting already with naphtha
lene dimer, demonstrate a much stronger preference for
cofacial stacking as compared to the Tshaped or
CH    geometry that is similar in energy in the case of
(benzene)2 but much less stable for larger acene dimers.10
All of the acene dimers exhibit oset stacking, in which
the centertocenter coordinate of the aromatic rings is
paralleldisplaced, e.g., by 1.8 A in the case of benzene
dimer.
