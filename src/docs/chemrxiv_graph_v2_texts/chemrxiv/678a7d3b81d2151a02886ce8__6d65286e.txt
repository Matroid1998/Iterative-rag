Description:
A polymeric sensor that exhibits turn-on fluorescence in the presence of Au.

Text:
In 2020, Gates and co
workers reported a polymeric phosphine sensor which 
also exhibited turnon fluorescence in the presence 
of Au or Au3.11 This effect was also attributed to 
coordination of the P(III) centre to the metal ions, in 
conjunction with a fluorenebased backbone. Other
