Description:
Has a theoretical capacity of 3579 mA h g-1 or 8340 mA h cm3.

Text:
However, while lithiumgraphite 
intercalates are safer and more stable they have only a tenth of 
the energy density of metallic lithium.2 Silicon is a good active 
material for Liion anodes because it has a superior theoretical 
capacity of 3579 mA h g1 (or 8340 mA h cm3) for Li15Si4, and  
unlike some transition metals  it is not toxic and abundant.
