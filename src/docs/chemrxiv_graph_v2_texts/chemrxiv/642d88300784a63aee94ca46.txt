Description:
A component required in the preparation of magnetic biochar to impart magnetic properties.

Text:
Magnetic biochar (MBC) is a material possessing magnetic separation capabilities, that can be obtained from 
the same raw materials used to have biochar. Several techniques exist to produce it. As explained by Xiao et 
al., 2023, the preparation of MBC requires the inclusion of iron in the raw material or the addition of magnetic 
precursors (Niu et al., 2020). Two types of feedstocks are involved in the preparation the ironcontaining 
waste biomass and the nonironcontaining biomass. In the second case, the raw material requires a magnetic 
precursor for creating magnetic features. The preparation methods in both cases have been clearly illustrated 
by Xiao et al., 2023. Of MBC, we discussed (Sparavigna, 2023) about its use in composites for shielding 
electromagnetic interferences and absorption of microwaves.
