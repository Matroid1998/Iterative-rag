On the other hand, the ammonia oxidation reaction
(AOR) allows us to electrochemically convert captured
ammonia into NH4NO3 salts, providing the opportunity to
increase gross profits and sustainability of the process.5
Since some AOR catalysts materials, including Ptbased cat
alysts and nickel oxides and hydroxides, have demonstrated
selectivity toward N2 formation through reaction 1,6,7 it
becomes critical to understand how the nature of the catalyst
surface controls selectivity in order to design an AOR
catalyst to convert ammonia into fertilizer.
