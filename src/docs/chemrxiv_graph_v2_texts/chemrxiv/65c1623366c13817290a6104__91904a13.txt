Forms highly crosslinked lightweight networks crucial in industrial applications like transportation.

Text:
Polymer networks can be crosslinked via permanent
covalent bonds. Polymer networks can include supersoft
hydrogels that mimic human tissue1, protective ultrahard
coatings2,
and
highly
bonded
adhesives3. Highly
crosslinked lightweight networks, such as those formed
with epoxide, are crucial in industrial applications like
transportation, where reducing vehicle weight improves
passenger safety and reduces harmful greenhouse gas
emissions. The
process
of
crosslinking
or

polymers is typically accomplished via a) mixing, b) heat,
or c) high energy light. Heat and light are popular routes,

always feasible, as light cannot pass through opaque
materials, and heat can damage delicate or ammable
substrates. Alternatively,

Description:
Reactive groups used in graft polymers for crosslinking.

Text:
To
accomplish this, graft polymers bearing reactive epoxide
15groups
are
mixed
with
small
molecule
aminethiol
crosslinkers. Ultrasonic irradiation is used to apply high
strain rates to the shielded polymers. Straining of the graft
polymers overcomes their steric barrier to interaction with
the small molecule crosslinkers, facilitating a reaction,
that
rapidly
strengthens
the
material. The
resultant
materials achieve elastic modulus values comparable to
ultra hard commercial epoxy coatings. We anticipate that
these shielded polymers will be useful as extremely hard
and solventresistant coatings and as adhesives that can
be cured by focusing ultrasound through the surfaces the
adhesive is bound to. Materials and Methods
