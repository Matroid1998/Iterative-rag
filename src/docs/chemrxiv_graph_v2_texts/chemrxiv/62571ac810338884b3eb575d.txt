An energy carrier proposed for use in hydrogen fuel cells to convert energy into electricity.

Green hydrogen economy 
Despite decades of research towards alternatives, fossil fuels account for more than 80 of global energy 
consumption today.1 Facing dwindling natural resources and burgeoning ecological consequences, we are 
challenged with charting a sustainable course for modern life using renewable energy sources. This will 
require safe and reliable methods of converting, storing, and using energy that can compete with 
hydrocarbon fuels extracted from the Earth. While the optimal solutions may vary depending on 
geographical location and availability of alternative energyenabling materials, one major proposed 
avenue is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier and hydrogen fuel cells as a primary method of 
converting energy into electricity.

Description:
Has approximately twice the gravimetric energy density compared to fossil fuels.

Text:
The integrated system of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization 
on a societal scale is aspirationally referred to as the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen has the potential to act as a superior energy carrier when compared to fossil fuels, as it has 
approximately twice the gravimetric energy density and could have none of the carbon emissions.2 
However, the primary mode of producing hydrogen today is from reforming of fossil fuels (natural gas, 
oil, and coal), which together account for 96 of production.3 This is hardly a solution for enabling 
sustainable energy.

Description:
Produced for chemical purposes such as ammonia production and oil refinement.

Text:
Additionally, as of 2020 most (98) hydrogen is produced for chemical, non
energetic purposes such as ammonia production and oil refinement.4 It is well known that industrial 
ammonia production is central to sustaining the Earths human carrying capacity; this underscores the 
importance of developing renewable hydrogen production avenues. In this paper, we refer to the 
integration of renewable hydrogen into the global energy system as the green hydrogen economy (GHE) 
and explore research trends in each of the three facets of the green hydrogen economy green hydrogen 
production, hydrogen storage, and hydrogenbased fuel cells.
