Not detected towards Sgr B2(N).

and could detect neither propionamide nor the unsaturated prop2enamide or acrylamide,
H2CCHCONH2, towards Sgr B2(N).8 Since nitriles are abundant in the ISM, Alonso et
al. have speculated, that the hydrolysis of cyanoacetylene HCCCN, would lead to the
formation of 2propynamide, HCCCONH2; however, the search was unsuccesful.9
Apart from Nmethyl formamide10 no other species with molecular formula C2H5NO has
been found and it is therefore of interest to document those isomers and provide some key
background detail of these neutral species which contain in C, H, N and O  the four basic
exobiological elements.
