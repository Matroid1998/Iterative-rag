Description:
Porous materials with an internal pore structure that allows interaction with adsorptives and reactants throughout the bulk.

The discovery and industrial application of zeolites in the 1950s has set the ball rolling for the 
33 
evolution of porous materials and initiated a fruitful frontier in modern chemistry.1 Owing to their 
34 
internal pore structure, porous frameworks possess the ability to interact with adsorptives and 
35 
reactants not only at their surface, but throughout the bulk.2 Hence, the development of new porous 
36 
materials is closely linked to their application in adsorption processes and catalysis.
