Description:
Forms radicals that act as electrophilic open-shell species with a high propensity for hydrogen atom abstraction.

The selective functionalisation of short 
alkanes such as methane, available in natural gases, is a 
topic of current interest.14 Processes have been developed 
to convert gaseous hydrocarbons into highly valuable 
chemicals that serve as platform substrates for further ap
plications.2 However, due to their nonpolar and volatile 
nature, the specific activation of CH bonds remains a chal
lenging task. To address this challenge, hydrogen atom 
transfer (HAT) processes have emerged as a powerful 
tool.35 Small molecules such as chlorine radicals or oxy
gencentred alcoholate radicals act as electrophilic open
shell species with a high propensity for abstraction of hy
drogen atoms from electronrich CH bonds within the 
range of their bonddissociation energy.610 The resulting 
carboncentred radicals undergo subsequent transfor
mations and functionalisation reactions.

Description:
Produced as radicals upon excitation of Ce4 ligand complexes by visible or near UV light.

Re
cently, the groups of Schelter and Zuo have developed ce
riumbased photosensitizers13, 14 and impressive method
ologies involving the formation of coloured Ce4ligand 
complexes through the reaction of CeCl3 and chloride salts 
or alcoholate ligands, respectively.9, 1518 Upon excitation by 
visible or near UVlight, these complexes undergo oxidative 
accumulation, yielding chlorine or alkoxy radicals.19, 20 
These electrophilic species selectively abstract hydrogen at
oms from complex molecules, and the resulting nucleophilic 
carboncentred radicals are successfully trapped by deriva
tives of ditertbutyl (azodicarboxylate), hypothesized to 
close the catalytic cycle of Ce3Ce4.21 However, in some 
conditions where both CeCl3 and short alcohols were used 
as the catalytic system, the nature of the eventual active hy
drogen atom transfer (HAT) species remains unresolved 
and is still under discussion despite numerous mechanistic 
investigations conducted by both groups (Scheme 1).10, 17,
