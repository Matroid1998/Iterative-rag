Description:
Exhibits intrinsically poor ionic and electronic conductivities.

Despite the massive advantages LSBs offer, significant challenges must be still overcome to ensure 
their seamless industrial integration. Both S8 and Li2S exhibit intrinsically poor ionic and electronic 
conductivities, which lead to poor dischargecharge performances.
