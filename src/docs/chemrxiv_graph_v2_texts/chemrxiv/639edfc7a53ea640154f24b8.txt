Description:
A critical element with limited availability, used in lithium-ion batteries.

The growing reliance on renewable energy and the increasing demands of grid storage, electric 
vehicles, and portable electronics necessitates the development of battery technologies 
beyond lithiumion batteries (LIBs). Although LIBs offer excellent performance, the limited 
availability of certain critical elements, such as Co and Li 1, has led to an increased focus on 
alternative types of batteries, which could offer longerlasting and more sustainable supply 
chains. One possible alternative is the fluorideion battery (FIB) 2, which uses fluoride ions (F) 
as the ionic charge carrier instead of Li. Although investigations of fluorideion conductors have been performed for many years 3, 
serious consideration of FIB technology only began to emerge after the recent proofofconcept 
demonstration by Reddy and Fichtner 2a.
