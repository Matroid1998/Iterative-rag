Description:
Compounds investigated for their exciton coupling mode in chiral systems.

Text:
Here 44,11, 33 linkages are
involved in the connection, and their ECD spectra have been ex
tensively investigated by the many experimental works.31,3335
Because of the relatively small molecular size and the reduced
flexibility, bisphenanthrenes have been the subject of many theo
retical works aimed at reproducing and interpreting experimental
ECD spectra.3337 In the previous calculations, single molecules
or the exciton coupling mode have been adopted. For example,
Harada et.al. have investigated biphenanthryl compounds and
suggested that the exciton model may yield ambiguous conclu
sions in certain chiral biphenanthryl systems, and simple qualita
tive predictions based on the exciton method may not be suitable
for 1,1biphenanthryl compounds.34 Jurinovich et.al.

Description:
Studied for its exciton circular dichroism (CD) spectra and the impact of coupling between electric and magnetic transition moments.

Text:
conducted
simulations of exciton CD spectra for biphenanthryl derivatives,
using a gaugeindependent formulation to explore the impact of
the coupling between combined electric and magnetic transition
moments (m terms) and electricelectric coupling ( terms) on
the spectra.31 Although the m  terms were included in the
exciton model, their results significantly deviated from those ob
tained by the timedependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
calculation, potentially due to an oversight regarding the consid
eration of CTE states. Here we perform theoretical investigation on biphenanthryl
