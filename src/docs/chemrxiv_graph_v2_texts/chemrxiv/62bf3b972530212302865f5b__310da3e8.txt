Description:
Frequently used as a window layer in solar cells due to its chemical stability, wide bandgap, and high-quality heteroepitaxial interfaces.

Text:
IIIV compound semiconductors are important for
various electronic and optoelectronic applications, e.g.,
highelectronmobility transistors, lightemitting diodes,
photodetectors, electrooptic modulators, and frequency
mixing components. Solar cells made of IIIV semicon
ductors reach the highest efficiencies of any photovoltaic
technology so far 1. The AlxIn1xP (AlInP) material
system is frequently used as window layer in solar cells,
due to its favorable combination of chemical stability, suf
ficiently wide bandgap, and high quality heteroepitaxial
interfaces with many absorbers 2. In this context, the
Fermi level pinning due to AlInP surface states is highly
relevant for the device performance 3. This holds also
for the usage of AlInP as intermediate layer to form low
resistance ohmic contacts 4.
