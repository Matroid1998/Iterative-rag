Description:
Used in hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking for CC bond cleavage on supported metal catalysts.

Text:
Two of the most promising routes for catalytic polyolefin upcycling are hydrogenolysis 
and hydrocracking. They require no additional feedstocks as metathesis or alkylation,8, 9 and are 
less susceptible to deactivation than pyrolysis or HaagDessau cracking on monofunctional acidic 
catalysts.6, 10, 11 Besides, these two reactions have been crucial parts of the oil refining industry and 
thus extensively studied with small alkane substrates, with established operation infrastructure and 
fundamental understanding partially applicable to polyolefin substrates. Both hydrogenolysis and 
hydrocracking refer to CC bond cleavage under H2 on supported metal catalysts, but the former 
cleaves CC bonds on the metal, while the latter cleaves CC bonds (and isomerizes substrates) 
on Brnsted acid sites after dehydrogenation on the metal, thus requiring metalacid bifunctional 
catalysts.
