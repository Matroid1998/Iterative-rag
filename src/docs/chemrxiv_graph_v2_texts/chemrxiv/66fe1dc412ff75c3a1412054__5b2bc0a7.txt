Description:
Involved in intramolecular oxidation-acetoxyl rearrangement through a concerted process.

Text:
Using 2H and 18O labelling and density functional
theory calculations, a possible reaction mechanism was pro
posed involving intramolecular oxidationacetoxyl rearrangement
through a concerted process published in 1. As one of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents
against a range of malignant tumours, the increasing de
mand for paclitaxel has led to the development of multiple
strategies to address supply issues instead of extracting
this compound from the bark of slowgrowing yews due
to its low content in Taxus plants. Li, C., et al. 2024 1. Escrich, A., et al. in August 2024 combined in silico meth
ods and functional gene analysis to help characterize the taxane
hydroxylase, which is needed to oxygenate paclitaxel interme
diates.
