Description:
Anions prepared using alkali fluoride salts as a fluorine source.

Such an approach would not only comply with the proposed 
EU law but also minimize or eliminate the need for perfluorinated materials in synthesizing 
most of the currently used fluoroalkylating reagents. To tackle these synthetic, legislative and environmental challenges, our strategy centered 
around the development of a versatile protocol capable of generating N, S and OCF3 anions 
on demand, and facilitate their immediate use as nucleophiles (Figure 1C, reaction design). This strategy entails the preparation of trifluoromethylheteroatom anions using alkali fluoride 
salts, as a fluorine source, in conjunction with appropriate precursors for each motif. In devising 
this reaction blueprint, certain criteria must be met the precursors should be (i) benchstable, 
(ii) commercially available or easily prepared, and (iii) operating in high atom economy.
