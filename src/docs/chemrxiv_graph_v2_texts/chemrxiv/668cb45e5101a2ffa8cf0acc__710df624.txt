Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), serving as a fundamental step in 
water splitting and a model reaction for exploring proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) 
processes, offers a sustainable approach to store intermittent renewable energy sources in the form 
of chemical fuels.13 The key to realizing this vision is the development of costeffective and 
efficient catalyst capable of minimizing energy loss in HER, thereby replacing the noble Pt 
catalyst.4 Among a wide variety of nonprecious catalysts explored, such as transition metal 
phosphides,5, 6 MoS2,7, 8 and gC3N4,9 twodimensional (2D) MXene, including transition metal 
carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have emerged as a particularly promising class of HER 
catalysts due to their good metallic conductivity, hydrophilic nature, and tunable surface 
reactivity.1015 Recently, several experiments have reported the excellent HER activity of these 2D 
layered materials, such as Mo2C and Ti2C.1618 
Experimentally, 2D MXenes are usually prepared by selective etching of the A group 
element atoms from their parent MAX phases, using strong etching solutions such as HF or 
NH4HF2.19 Here, M, A, and X represent the early transition metal, the main group IIIA or IVA 
element, and the carbon andor nitrogen atom, respectively.20 These preparation methods typically 
lead to the basal plane of assynthesized 2D MXenes being terminated by F, OH, and O 
species.21 However, as HER takes place in a reducing environment, these adsorbed species might 
undergo reduction to form HF or H2O through coupling with protons and electrons.22, 23 This 
suggests that the surface structures of 2D MXenes could become rather complicated under HER 
turnover conditions.
