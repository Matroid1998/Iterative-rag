Description:
Exhibits antiviral activity against SARSCoV2.

They demonstrated that the use of masks can prevent the 
transmission of SARSCoV2, leading to a virus absorption reduction by 70 when two 
mannequins used cloth and surgical masks and by almost 100 with N95 masks 9. Studies 
targeting the SARSCoV2 regarding the efficiency and reusability of masks as well as the 
development of masks intelligently designed with graphene were published last year by Liao et 
al. and Zhong et al. 10,11. The study by Hamdi et al. published this year suggests an antiviral 
activity of ZnO against the SARSCoV2 12. Extensive studies have been carried out to contain the advance of COVID19, leading 
to the development of vaccines in record time. However, despite these advances, the 
contamination rate remains high in several countries 1315.
