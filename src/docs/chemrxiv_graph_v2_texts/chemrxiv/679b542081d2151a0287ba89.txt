Description:
Highly fluorescent Al-based compounds with tunable photophysical properties.

Text:
Particular attention has been paid to the use of (O,N) 
and (N,N)bifunctional ligands due to the ease with which their 
photophysical properties can be tuned (Figure 1).1015 Over the last 
few decades, numerous examples of highly fluorescent Albased 
compounds have been reported,16 e.g. salen derivatives,17,18 
BODIPY 
frameworkbased 
complexes19, 
asymmetric 
acetylacetonates20,21 
and 
dinuclear 
triplestranded 
helicates 
(ALPHY),2224 
including 
recently 
reported 
dinuclear 
dimethylaluminium diketiminate, (Me2Al)2BODDI, which exhibited 
high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the condensed 
phase and solution (Figure 1).25 
Photoluminescence behaviour is often highly dependent on 
the aggregate state of the investigated molecular entities.
