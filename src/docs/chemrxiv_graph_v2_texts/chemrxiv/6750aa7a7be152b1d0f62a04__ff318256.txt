Description:
Can be identified in a static location using neutron diffraction.

This matters because the movement of 
electrons in all heme enzymes is invariably linked to the move
ment of protons, and controlling both is key to the design of 
bespoke heme catalysts for specific applications in the future.2 
The availability of neutron structures for some peroxidase en
zymes3 has meant that the protonation states of active site resi
dues can now be directly visualized. These neutron structures 
reveal individual hydrogen bonds, including to active site water 
molecules. But while neutron diffraction can identify single hy
drogen atoms (or, more specifically, deuterium atoms) in a 
static location, it cannot identify their origin, nor can it identify 
dynamic movements of protons during catalysis.
