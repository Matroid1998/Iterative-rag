Description:
A vinyl-based polymer synthesized through free-radical polymerization.

Text:
To date, most of the NCLPs are vinylbased polymers, such as poly(N
vinylpyrrolidone) (PNVP)3, poly(maleic anhydride) (PMAh)4, 
5, poly(itaconic 
anhydride) (PITA)6, 7, poly(Nvinylcaprolactam) (PNVC)16, and polyacrylonitrile 
(PAN)8, 9. One of the most common and useful reactions for synthesizing vinyl 
polymers is freeradical polymerization (FRP), in which an initiator is employed to start 
the reaction. Besides, to achieve polymers with wellcontrolled features, controlled 
radical polymerization (CRP) techniques are developed, such as atom transfer radical 
polymerization (ATRP) and reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) 
polymerization.1723 With the utilization of CRP, not only the molecular weight and 
dispersity of polymers can be wellcontrolled, but also their architectures can be 
designed and constructed.
