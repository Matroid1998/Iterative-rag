Description:
Fixed by microalgae during photosynthesis.

Text:
Microalgae are photosynthec unicellular microscopic organisms with extraordinary biodiversity. Under culture condions, these microorganisms can be grown at dierent scales in fresh, salt, brackish 
and even wastewater without the need for arable land.1,2,3 Microalgae x atmospheric CO2 while 
simultaneously producing biomass and O2 during photosynthesis. Therefore, microalgae can be seen 
as ecient microscopic biofactories that are capable of producing a broad variety of interesng 
metabolites in a sustainable way.4 Among these metabolites, lipids are of parcular interest since they 
can be used as feedstock for new highvalue materials.
