A strong acid used in polymerization processes.

plays important role in optimized 
polymerization condition. They got 1K ohm

polyaniline at 1 M hydrochloric acid aqueous 
solution with 14 ratio of monomer to initiator 
(Ammonium per sulphate) resulted in fabrics 
with much higher conductivity than comparable
works like bowman et al. where they got 72 
Scm from high molecular weight polyaniline
