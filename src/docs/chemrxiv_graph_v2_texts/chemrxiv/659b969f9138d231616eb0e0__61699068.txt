Description:
A nucleophilic group that can undergo alkylation or coupling with aryl halides.

Text:
Typically, general 
bioconjugation reactions on Cys utilize alkylation of the nucleophilic thiol2 or metalcatalyzed 
coupling of the thiol with aryl halides.3 Umpolung strategies of the nucleophilic thiol have also become 
an alternative coupling format.4 In terms of Trpmodification, a variety of indoleselective reactions 
have been utilized that include transition metal,5 metal carbenoid,6 or radicalmediated reaction.7,8 
The CH sulfenylation of indole with electrophilic sulfenyl chlorides,9 such as Schlorocysteine or its 
congener, represents an interresidue selective conjugation between Trp and Cys residues, that requires 
the oxidative umpolung to the Schlorocysteine using harmful chlorination agents such as sulfuryl 
chloride (SO2Cl2).10 Accordingly, these reactions are not compatible with the presence of Trp. Recently, 
we have developed interresidue selective reactions between Cys and Trp residues.
