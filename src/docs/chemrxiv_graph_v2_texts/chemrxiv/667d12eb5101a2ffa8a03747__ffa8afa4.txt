Description:
Large cations that favor high coordination numbers due to predominantly ionic bonding.

Given the 
difficulty of isolating linear Ln(III) complexes, we considered that a Dy(III) complex with only a 
single anionic ligand may show purer mJ states than a bent bisanionic complex and hence show 
relatively high TH. Indeed, the theoretical DyO cation has been predicted to have Ueff  2084 
cm1,6 but the isolation of such a coordinatively unsaturated complex is inherently challenging due 
to a combination of large Ln cations and predominantly ionic bonding regimes favouring high 
coordination numbers.8 The closest molecular analogues of DyO are endohedral fullerenes 
containing Dy2O fragments,912 and these compounds show favourable SMM properties, but 
magnetic relaxation is promoted by interactions of Dy(III) ions with the anionic cages.
