Incorporated in drug development to modify absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties.

13 In the area of pharmaceuticals, the substitution of CH 
with CD bonds in drug molecules presents a simple way 
of modifying a drugs absorption, distribution, metabo
lism, and excretion (ADME) properties, while maintain
ing the interaction with target and selectivity.34 There
fore, deuterium incorporation in drug development has 
gained significant attention, leading to the FDA approval 
of the first deuterated drug, deutetrabenazine, in 2017, 
and the first de novo deuterated drug, deucravacitinib, in 
2022 (Figure 1A).57 Moreover, more than 15 candidate 
drugs with deuterium are currently undergoing evalua
tion in clinical trials.8 In addition, they also play an im
portant role in mechanistic investigation via kinetic iso
tope effect (KIE) studies, as standards for mass spectros
copy, and in developing materials with improved prop
erties.13 
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) permits the most 
ideal, sustainable, and facile access to latestage isotopic 
labelling and avoids cumbersome multistep de novo syn
thesis or functional group interconversion.919 Directed 
HIE catalyzed by transitionmetal complexes, especially 
Irbased catalysts like Crabtrees catalyst, Kerrs catalyst, 
and Tamms catalyst, has been well established for tar
geting specifically ortho CH bonds adjacent to directing 
groups (Figure 1B).2025 However, alternative ap
proaches which do not require the presence of directing 
groups are in high demand.
