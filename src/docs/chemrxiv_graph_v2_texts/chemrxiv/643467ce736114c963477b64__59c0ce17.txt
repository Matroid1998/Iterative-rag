spherical, consisting of small graphene platelets bound 
together with amorphoushydrocarbon material, tending 
to become pure carbon in prolonged high temperature 
heating. Diamond NPs (Fig. 1c), have cores with 
diamond structure, but may have graphitic surface 
layers. Carbon nanoonions are synthesized by 
annealing
