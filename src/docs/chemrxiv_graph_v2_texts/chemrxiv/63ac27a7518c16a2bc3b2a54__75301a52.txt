Description:
A metal whose rising prices and supply issues have led to the search for alternatives in cathode materials.

Text:
The earliest studied oxide cathode is the layered LiCoO2.3 With the rising prices for cobalt and the 
geopolitical issues with its supply, nickel became a popular ingredient for cathodes since it is 
cheaper and more abundant.3,5 This led to the discoveries of ternary LiNiO compounds such as 
LiNiO2 and Li2NiO3 which eliminate the use of Co (see Figure 1).58 The composition and structure 
of several LiNiO phases have very specific growth conditions. A subtle change in the LiNi ratio 
and oxygen partial pressure can lead to different structures.9 This is because (1) many of those 
structures are related as they are based on the same oxygen cubic closepacked (ccp) sublattice;9 
(2) Ni3 and Ni4 are difficult to stabilize and can be easily converted to Ni2 (e.g.
