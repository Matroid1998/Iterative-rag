Description:
Interacts with catalytic transition metal surfaces and is used as a probe molecule to obtain atomistic information upon adsorption.

Text:
Transition Metals (TMs) are ubiquitous materials employed in a myriad of industrially and 
technologically relevant fields. These range from energy storage devices 1, through drug 
release nanotechnologies 2, and to heterogeneous catalysis 3, to name a few. The 
interaction of carbon monoxide (CO) with catalytic TM surfaces has been extensively studied 
in the past due to its importance to chemical industries 46. The CO properties paved the 
way to its use as a probe molecule to obtain atomistic information on the studied surfaces 
upon CO adsorption 79.
