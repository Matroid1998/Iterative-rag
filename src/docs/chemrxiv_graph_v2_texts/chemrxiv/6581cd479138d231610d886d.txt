Description:
An element that is a key building block in natural products, agrochemicals, and bioactive molecules.

Text:
Nitrogenated heterocycles are important motifs that occur in many FDAapproved drugs and 
they also serve as key building blocks for the construction of natural products, agrochemicals and 
other bioactive molecules.14 In the pharmaceutical sector alone, over 84 of approved and 
structurally unique drugs contain at least one nitrogen atom, with 59 of these displaying at least 
one nitrogen heterocycle.1 Among this latter group of compounds, piperidines appear in 55 of 
all FDAapproved drugs, making versatile and stereocontrolled methods for their synthesis 
attractive.
