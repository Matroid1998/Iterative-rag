Description:
A polar solvent of high boiling point used in IONF synthesis.

Text:
successfully used 2pyrrolidone as other polar solvent of high boiling point 
for IONF synthesis,26 whereas Zhang et al. used a polymer melt of 1000 gmol1 PEG as reaction medium, mixed 
with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) or poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)18 as iron chelating polymers27. Nikitin et al. studied 
the thermal decomposition of Fe(acac)3 complex in benzyl ether in presence of stoichiometric amount of 1,2
