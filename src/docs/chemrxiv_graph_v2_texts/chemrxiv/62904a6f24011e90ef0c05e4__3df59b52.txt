Indoor air quality is closely related to human health.1 As one of the main pollutants in
the indoor environment, formaldehyde, is a colorless and irritating gas, which is easy
to volatilize at room temperature.2,3 Exposure to formaldehyde even as low as 0.30.5
ppm over shortterm periods of time can cause eyes and nasal passages to be irritated
due to formaldehyde.4 Exposure to formaldehyde at larger than 1 ppm concentration
for extended time causes serious health issues, such as lung function decline, liver
injury, and other pathologies.5 Removing formaldehyde from indoor air is particularly
vital to maintain human health since more than 80 time of peoples life are spent in
indoors.6
Catalytic oxidation is a promising technology to remove formaldehyde in indoor
environments.7,8 Formaldehyde can be converted into carbon dioxide and water with
the assistance of catalyst.
