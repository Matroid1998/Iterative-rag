Description:
Exhibits exceptionally high mobility of lattice oxygen.

Text:
Indeed, the excep
tionally high mobility of CeO2 lattice oxygen allows Pt adatoms to adopt a wide range of
adsorption geometries, which exhibit distinct catalytic properties depending on the PtO
coordination sphere.5,26 It was recently shown that the local coordination of Pt adatoms on
CeO2 surfaces depends on the temperature at which the catalyst is prepared, resulting in
