Description:
A feedstock for carbon nanoparticles studied for O2 oxidative etching kinetics.

Text:
For example, in experiments using single NP 
mass spectrometry to study kinetics for individual carbon NPs in the 1200 to 2100 K range, we 
found that both sublimation1 and O2 oxidative etching23 kinetics varied substantially for NPs from 
different feedstocks (graphitic, graphene oxide, carbon black, diamond, nanoonion), but that even 
for NPs from the same feedstock, the initial rates varied by up to an order of magnitude. More 
surprisingly, the etching rates varied over time, with rates oscillating by orders of magnitude. All 
types of carbon NPs were found to evolve to become essentially inert to O2 etching, but the time 
required for this evolution varied strongly for different carbon materials and for different NPs.
