Description:
Supramolecular compounds synthesized using cucurbitnurils as molecular beads.

Text:
Due to their remarkable binding affinities and selectivity towards various organic, inorganic or 
biological guests, cucurbitnurils (CBn, n  58, 10, 1315) with a hydrophobic nonpolarizable 
cavity and two oxygencrowned portals have become molecular beads for the synthesis of 
supramolecular compounds such as rotaxanes, polyrotaxanes, dendrimers and rotaxanebased 
molecular switches 611. CBn usually form hostguest complexes with a cationic guest inside 
their hydrophobic cavities with high binding constants in aqueous solution. Starting with the selective complexation of CB6 with alkyl and arylsubstituted ammonium ions 
in solution forming hostguest complexes through hydrophobic and iondipole interactions, first 
studied by Mock 12, the design and construction of highly ordered advanced supramolecular 
architectures on the basis of CB6 has rapidly evolved 8, 13.
