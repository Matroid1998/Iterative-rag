Description:
Very small molecules used as models and precursors for finite armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons.

. Nanographenes or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with open shell 
electronic states (and unpaired electrons) are relatively rare, but highly important for novel 
applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and spintronics.1 One of the best and safest 
ways to design andor synthesize openshell PAHs and GNRs is to break the alternant (bipartite) 
topology.28 This has been recently accomplished by introducing StoneWales (ST) defects9 
(including pairs of pentagonalheptagonal together with hexagonal rings) for very small 
molecules (periacenes) such as bisanthene and peritetracene.24 These molecules (periacenes) 
can be used as models (and precursors) for the 3x2 and 4x2 finite (short) armchair graphene 
nanoribbons (AGNRs) with Z3 and 4 zigzag rings respectively, and 2 armchair rings. Obviously, the same molecules can be used as models for the corresponding finite (thin) zigzag 
nanoribbons (ZGNRs).
