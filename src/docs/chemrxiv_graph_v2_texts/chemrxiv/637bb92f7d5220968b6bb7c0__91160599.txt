Elemental sulfur and polysulfides play a major role in organic synthesis, 1, 2 biochemistry, 3, 4 materials science5 and 
other fields of chemistry. Due to its rather unique catenation behavior, elemental sulfur has multiple allotropes with 
the most stable being cyclooctasulfur (S8). 6 Sulfur is mostly known for its reactivity as an electrophile, but the 
types of products obtained vary based on the nature of the nucleophile. Strong nucleophiles like phosphines, 79 
sulfite, 10, 11 or cyanide12, 13 provide monosulfide products exclusively.

Exhibit seemingly unpredictable reactivity under various conditions.

3133 As such, computational investigations seem uniquelypositioned to provide key mechanistic 
information to understand the seemingly unpredictable reactivity of sulfur and polysulfides under various 
conditions. The precise determination of the mechanism of these reactions would allow for greater predictability in 
the design of reactions involving sulfur and polysulfides and facilitate the study of biochemical polysulfides. 3436 
To tackle this problem, we decided to focus on the simple but representative reactions of sulfur with cyanide 
and phosphines, which generate the monosulfide products R3PS (phosphine sulfides) or SCN (thiocyanate) 
quantitatively. The reaction of sulfur with phosphines was first reported in 18377 and the formation of the phosphine 
sulfide was shown to be almost instantaneous.

Description:
Compounds with chains of sulfur atoms that can decompose via resonance between sulfur atoms.

Text:
Another proposal for the decomposition of 
the polysulfides came from Schmidt who argued, based on claims of resonance between sulfur atoms in polysulfide 
chains, that the negativelycharged terminal sulfur was in fact the most electrophilic position and could be 
abstracted by the nucleophile (Scheme 1 path B). 37 Due to limited experimental support for either mechanism, 
over the following decades both the FossBartlett3841 and Schmidt42 mechanisms were presented as correct in books 
and reviews of the topic. Since these reactions have fast rates and clean product profiles, they have found 
applications for the titration 12 or detection of elemental sulfur43, 44 in complex biochemical settings.

Description:
Compounds that react with cyanide or phosphines.

Text:
We now report 
a comprehensive computational study of these reaction pathways, which provides the first evidence that the Foss
Bartlett mechanism, albeit plausible, is an incomplete picture of the reactivity of polysulfides with cyanide or 
phosphines.
