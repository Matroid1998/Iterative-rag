Description:
A photocatalyst used in combination with an iron group transfer catalyst for aryl chlorination.

Text:
For example, we found 
that two copperbased catalysts were optimal for azidoarylation13, 
but a ruthenium photocatalyst in combination with an iron group 
transfer catalyst were preferable for the aryl chlorination of vinyl bo
ronic esters14. We questioned whether our dual catalysis strategy could be engi
neered to accommodate a range of electronically diverse alkenes to
wards a broadly applicable arylchlorination reaction, during which 
the formation of the carbonchlorine bond proceeds exclusively 
through a catalyzed group transfer pathway rather than radical cou
pling or carbocation pathways, which define other processes9, 15.
