Description:
A soluble and highly bioavailable form of iron.

Notably, a few wellplaced mutations can provoke dra
matic changes in both enzyme substrate specificity 
and the reaction catalyzed (e.g., hydroxylation vs. 
dealkylation). Thus, significant precedent exists for 
engineering enzymes toward novel biocatalyzed reac
tions. There are nevertheless many un and under ex
plored biocatalyzed reactions. One relatively unexplored area is in enzymes 
that synthesize inorganic nanomaterials. Naturally oc
curring examples of such enzymes are common. For 
example, multimeric ironstoring ferritin and ferritin
like proteins oxidize soluble and highly bioavailable 
Fe2 into uniform ferric nanoparticles as a means of 
promoting cellular Fe2 homeomostasis2022. Multi
copper oxidases such as manganese oxidase are 
thought to play primary roles in the bacterial for
mation of geological manganese oxide materials2325.
