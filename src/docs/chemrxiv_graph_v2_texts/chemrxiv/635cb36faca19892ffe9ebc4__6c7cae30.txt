Description:
Used in brass clamps for wire joints.

Text:
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) contain atomizing units that are comprised of 
elementsmetals. Some atomizing unit components are preserved in all generations of ECs 1
4, while only fourth generation podstyle ECs contain connector platespins and magnets 5. Atomizer components usually include wires (copper, silver), a filament (nickel, chromium), wick 
(silicon), wire joints, which can be brass clamps (copper, zinc), solder (tin, lead), or braised 
wires 12, 4, 6. Some atomizer elements, such as chromium, lead, and nickel, are carcinogens 
and respiratory toxicants 710. While other atomizer elements, such as calcium, potassium, and 
magnesium, are less likely to cause harm 2, 4, 11.

Description:
Concentrations are higher in e-liquids after use, presumably released from atomizing units during heating.

Refill fluids also contain elementsmetals 1114, some of which (selenium, aluminum, 
tin, arsenic, chromium, lead, nickel, zinc, copper, manganese) are present before use and are 
known to be harmful 1117. Selenium, which is an impurity of propylene glycol and glycerin, 
can cause cytotoxicity to bronchial epithelial cells 11 and is on the Federal Drug 
Administrations (FDA) Harmful and Potentially Harmful list and the Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Research (ATSDR) Priority List of Hazardous Substances list 7, 15. Concentrations of some elements (copper, manganese, zinc, nickel) are higher in eliquids after 
use, presumably because they are released from the atomizing units during heating 1112, 18
20. In addition to elementsmetals, the fluid also contains nicotine and numerous flavor 
chemicals 2126.
