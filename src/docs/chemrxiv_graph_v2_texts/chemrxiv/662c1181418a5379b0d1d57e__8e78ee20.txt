Description:
Targets calcium channels and increases intracellular concentration of GABA.

For example, Valproate targets Sodium channels for modulating the
membrane potential and Ttype Calcium channels for modulating neurotransmitter release
(Johannessen and Johannessen, 2003). And Gabapentine targets Calcium channels and increases
intracellular concentration of GABA (Czuczwar and Patsalos, 2001). Vigabatrin is the only
approved drug that targets GABA transaminase. However, Vigabatrin is associated with serious
adverse effects (Hawker and Silverman, 2012a). Therefore, GABAT, the validated molecular
target of Vigabatrin, was chosen as the target for the design of novel antiepileptic drugs in this
work. GABAT is also known as GABAamino transferase (GABAAT). Computer aided drug design can facilitate the rapid development of new drugs (Salman et al.,
2021), (Azad et al., 2023).
