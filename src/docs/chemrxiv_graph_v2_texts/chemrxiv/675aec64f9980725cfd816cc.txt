Description:
Can be stabilized by solvent coordination.

Text:
Universal synthesisers also require a 
significant investment of time, funds and training to setup 
which may hinder the exploitation the advantages of lab 
digitalisation some parts of the research community. Figure 1 A summary of the known firstrow transition metal 
silylamide complexes and the relative reduction potentials of 
their respective M(II) ions. Notably nickel analogues can be sta
bilized by solvent coordination. N  N(SiMe3)2
