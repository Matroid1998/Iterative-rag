Description:
An alloy formed by fully lithiated silicon, with a high theoretical specific capacity of 3579 mAhg.

Text:
Nevertheless, the maximum specific capacity 
that can be theoretically reached with graphite is 372 mAhg, which limits the range of use cases 
for LIBs. In these regards, alloy negative electrodes, and in particular silicon (Si) 7, stands out 
as a promising candidate for next generation LIB anodes. When fully lithiated, Si forms the Li15Si4 
alloy, showing a high theoretical specific capacity of 3579 mAhg, ten times larger than graphite. It also shows an appropriate voltage (0.4 V) for being adopted as an anode. However, Si 
undergoes a 300 volume expansion upon charging, which induces Si particle pulverization, 
unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and contact loss between Si and conductive 
additives because of internal stresses 8,9.
