Description:
A nanocrystalline and disordered material with varying CaSi ratio and water content.

Cement paste is a multiphase material containing an extensive network of pores of different sizes. 53 
Water, either in bulk form or adsorbed at the surfaces of the different cement phases, is 
54 
omnipresent 1. The most important phase in cement is calciumsilicatehydrate (CSH) and its 
55 
Albearing analog, present in lowCO2 cement calciumaluminumsilicatehydrate (CASH). The 
56 
C(A)SH phase itself is a nanocrystalline and disordered material with varying CaSi ratio and 
57 
water content and distribution. Not surprisingly, water plays a crucial role as it directly influences 
58 
the mechanical properties of cement, such as shrinkage, creep, and strength of concrete 
59 
structures 2, and fluid and solute transport processes that control cement geochemical 
60 
alteration and durability 3.
