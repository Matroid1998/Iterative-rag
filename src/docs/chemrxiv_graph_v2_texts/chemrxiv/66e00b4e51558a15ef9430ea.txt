Description:
A metal complex used in the preparation of dendriplexes for siRNA transfection.

Text:
A solution could be a labile metal 
34 
complex with a neutral dendrimer, that could release the metal ions after release of the 
35 
polynucleotide. 36

The 
preparation 
of 
the 
metal 
complexes 
(CuSO4)18DABdendr(Pyrr)64 
and 
39 
(ZnCl2)22DABdendr(Pyrr)64, cell culture, MTT assay, Zeta potential measurements, 
40 
preparation of dendriplexes for siRNA transfection, flow cytometry and RTPCR are 
41 
described in the Supplementary material. 42 

43 
Result and Discussion 
44 
Our previous studies showed that 5methoxycarbonyl2pyrrolidone (pyrrolidone) modified 
45 
PAMAM G4 dendrimer at the highest concentration of 200 M was practically nontoxic to
