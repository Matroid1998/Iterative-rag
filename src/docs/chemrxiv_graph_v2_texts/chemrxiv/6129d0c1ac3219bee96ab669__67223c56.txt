The main constituent of many small molecule-based drugs, important in the pharmaceutical industry.

Text:
As the scaffold of 1,4dihydropyridine is the main 
constituent of many small moleculebased drugs, it emerged as one of the very important 
molecules in the pharmaceutical industry.8 Several substituted 1, 4DHP derivatives containing 
drugs are clinically accepted as cardiovascular agents and they have been using for the 
treatment of hypertension such as nicardipine, amlodipine, nifedipine etc.9 Some of the drugs 
containing DHP derivatives are shown in Figure 1. In addition, 1,4DHP derivatives have also 
been used as antioxidant,10 antimalarial,11 antibacterial,12 antifungal,13 antiplasmodial,14 anti

inflammatory,15 and antidiabetic agents.16 Besides, they have also shown promising potential 
as HIV protease inhibitor,17 antiischemic agents for treating Alzheimers disease18 chemo 
sensitizers in tumour therapy,19 platelet antiaggregatory agents,20 bronchodilators for treating 
tuberculosis,21 cystic fibrosis,22 asthma23 and neuroprotective agents in neuronal diseases.24
