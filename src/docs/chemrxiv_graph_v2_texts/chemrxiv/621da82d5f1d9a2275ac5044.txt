The global COVID19 pandemic continues to wreak economic and social havoc globally, with at least 330 
million infections and 5.6 million deaths globally (January 2022). Effective vaccines and drug therapies are 
essential to bringing the pandemic to an end. This global challenge has seen an unprecedented and intense 
focus on coronavirus research, resulting in the development of vaccines in impressively short times. Similarly, empirical and limited rational selection of drugs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone provided 
early drug treatments that limited morbidity and mortality. However, more effective drugs are still required 
to treat COVID19 and other coronavirus diseases, such as SARS and MERS, as well as new viruses that may 
emerge in the future.
