Description:
A reactant used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

These energy savings 
through process intensification (up to 35) could be achieved by production at reduced 
temperatures via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with additional process energy reduction if air 
separation units for the oxygen reactant are eliminated4. Solidstate electrogenerative reactors are 
a viable technology for process intensification, with chemicals (olefins) as the main product and 
electricity as a potential byproduct5. These electrogenerative reactors provide an added modular 
advantage for use at the wellhead and can thus separate NGLs from shale gas further improving 
energy savings. 26 24  2

However, the introduction of oxygen into the reaction also generates carbon oxides, which 
have a much lower thermodynamic potential for formation and will decrease process efficiency 
and cost performance.
