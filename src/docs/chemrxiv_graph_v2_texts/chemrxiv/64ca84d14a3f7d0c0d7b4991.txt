Description:
A Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor used for its capacity to suppress inflammation via modulation of JAK-STAT signalling pathways.

Text:
Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors were recently identified as promising drug candidates for 
repurposing in Alzheimers disease (AD) due to their capacity to suppress inflammation via modulation 
of JAKSTAT signalling pathways. Besides interaction with primary therapeutic targets, JAK inhibitor 
drugs frequently interact with unintended, often unknown, biological offtargets, leading to 
associated effects. Nevertheless, the relevance of JAK inhibitors offtarget interactions in the context 
of AD remains unclear. Methods Putative offtargets of baricitinib and tofacitinib were predicted using a machine learning 
(ML) approach. After screening scientific literature, offtargets were filtered based on their relevance 
to AD. Targets that had not been previously identified as offtargets of baricitinib or tofacitinib were 
subsequently tested using biochemical or cellbased assays.

Description:
Inhibits casein kinase 2 subunit alpha 2 (CK2a2) and dual leucine zipper kinase (MAP3K12) with Kd values of 5.8 M.

From those, active concentrations were 
compared to bioavailable concentrations in the brain predicted by physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling. Results With the aid of ML and in vitro activity assays, we identified two enzymes previously unknown 
to be inhibited by baricitinib, namely casein kinase 2 subunit alpha 2 (CK2a2) and dual leucine zipper 
kinase (MAP3K12), both with Kd values of 5.8 M. Predicted maximum concentrations of baricitinib in 
brain tissue using PBPK modelling range from 1.3 to 23 nM, which is two to three orders of magnitude 
below the corresponding binding constant. Conclusion In this study, we extended the list of baricitinib offtargets that are potentially relevant 
for AD progression and predicted drug distribution in the brain.
