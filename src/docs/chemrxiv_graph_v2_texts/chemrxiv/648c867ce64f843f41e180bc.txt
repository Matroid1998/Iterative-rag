Description:
Produced under significantly lower temperature and pressure conditions through mechanochemistry.

Shockwave induced reactions are a prime example of the latter,19,25,27 where the shock
heats the material hundreds to thousands of kelvin and can induce large intramolecular
strains.23,28,29
Mechanochemistry is becoming widely relevant in engineering and industrial applica
tions30 such as force responsive materials31 and mechanochemical green engineering.32 In fun
damental chemistry, mechanochemistry is utilized for a wide variety of purposes such as for
driving exotic andor forbidden reactions,12,33,34 for developing new synthesis routes,20,3539
and for minimizing the amount of energy andor eliminating solvent needs to incur reac
tions.8,32,40,41 A striking example of this is mechanochemistry allowing for ammonia produc
tion under significantly lower temperature and pressure conditions.36,42,43 Significant theoret
ical work has explained experimental trends,12,44,45 yet there is still a significant knowledge
gap in the fundamentals of strain influenced reactions, especially in batch processes and
condensed matter.46,47
In condensed matter cases, manybody mechanochemistry comes into play, where the
strains are nonlinear, characterized by bending and twisting of functional groups.23,48 It is
critical to understand how these deformations map their strain energy back onto the reaction
coordinate, as the amount in which the strain drives the system towards the transition state
can well determine the effective activation energy of the deformed system.11,48 A simplified
formulation for how mechanical strain can lower the activation barrier considered the force

, in this work we seek to formalize this
equation to generally apply to a wide range of complex molecular strains.
