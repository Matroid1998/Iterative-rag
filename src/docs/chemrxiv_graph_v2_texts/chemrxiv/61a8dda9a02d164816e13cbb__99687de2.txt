Description:
A toxic impurity in styrene raw materials that affects polymerization catalysts.

Text:
Styrene is an important monomer of synthetic resin, ion exchange resin, and 
synthetic rubber in the polymerization industry. However, a small amount of benzene 
acetylene is often present in styrene raw materials. Benzene acetylene is toxic to the 
polymerization catalyst, and the maximum acceptable limit is not more than 10ppm 19. Therefore, the removal of benzene acetylene in styrene raw materials is very important. At present, benzene acetylene impurities are mainly removed by selective 
hydrogenation to styrene in industry, but it is necessary to prevent the over
hydrogenation of benzene acetylene to ethylbenzene at the same time. Therefore, the 
selective hydrogenation of benzene acetylene to olefin has very important practical 
significance 10, 11.
