Description:
Experiences a strong ligand field introduced by cyanide and bipyridyl ligands, destabilizing metal-centered states in favor of metal-to-ligand charge transfer ones.

Transition metal complexes can
be particularly amenable to changes in reactivity through solvent
interactions.23,24 One example is Fe(CN)4(bipy)2, which expe
riences a particularly strong ligand field introduced by the cyanide
and bipyridyl ligands,2527 which, combined with its high charge
and polarity, destabilizes the metalcentered (MC) states in favor
of the metaltoligand charge transfer (MLCT) ones.28 Compared
to 4d5d metals analogues, Earthabundant transition metal com
plexes based on 3d metals like Fe tend to have short MLCT life
times, limiting their use as photocatalysts.29,30 Interestingly, the
solvent has a considerable effect on the excited state dynamics of
