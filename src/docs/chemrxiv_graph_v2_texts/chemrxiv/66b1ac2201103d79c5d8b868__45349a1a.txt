Description:
A fourth-generation antibiotic drug effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

Text:
Moxifloxacin is a fourthgeneration antibiotic drug that belongs to the fluoroquinolone 
family.1 The fluoroquinolones are quinolones with fluorine at position six of the naphthyridine 
ring.2 Previous studies indicate that the presence of fluorine atom in the moxifloxacin (Moxi) 
structure makes its antibacterial activity effective against both types of grampositive and gram
negative pathogens.3,4,5 Its clinical studies confirmed that it is a welltolerated drug and has high 
efficacy against pneumonia, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and chronic bronchitis.6 Previous study 
was conducted for the estimation of moxifloxacin in bulk and pharmaceutical formulations by 
spectrophotometer.7 Analysis of the Moxifloxacin in human plasmas was also conducted by liquid 
chromatographyelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.8 Here, in this study we 
developed and validated a new, simple, precise, accurate, cost effective and reproducible method 
for the determination of moxifloxacin in bulk and pharmaceutical formulations by reverse phase
high pressure liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) as shown in figure 1.
