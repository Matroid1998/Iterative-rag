Description:
A potential energy carrier in a hydrogen economy with fuel cell electric vehicles.

Text:
A significant con
tributor is the transport of people and goods, which in a hydrogen 
economy with fuel cell electric vehicles would be shifted from fossil 
resources to green energy.1 While today, platinum group metal 
catalysts are used in fuel cell chemistry, metal and nitrogen doped 
carbon (MNC) catalysts play an increasingly important role as 
cheap and earth abundant substitutes in different types of fuel cell,2
5 and other energy conversion reactions such as water splitting and 
carbon dioxide reduction or in metal air batteries.612 For the oxy
gen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange fuel cells 
(PEFC), FeNC catalysts reach activities comparable to low
platinum content PtC catalysts.2, 45 
FeNC catalysts are typically prepared by pyrolysis, e.g.
