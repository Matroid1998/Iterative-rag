Description:
Demonstrated efficient arsenic removal from water sources with enhanced adsorption performance depending on the oxidation degree.

Text:
Graphene oxide composites (with chitosan 
and metal oxides)913 demonstrated efficient arsenic removal from different water sources, 
where adsorption performance enhances depending on the oxidation degree14. The arsenic 
adsorption capacity of graphene oxide also increases by innersphere complexation, 
especially using hydroxyl and carboxyl groups as oxidizing groups15. Phosphorene is a layered and puckered hexagonal nanostructure of phosphorous 
atoms linked by covalent bonds and weak interlayer dispersive interactions1618, which 
shows a lamellar structure, high carrier mobility, high chemical stability, and tunable 
bandgap (0.32.0 eV)1921. Phosphorenebased nanoadsorbents have been proposed to 
uptake pollutants such as formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides, and carbon oxides22,23. Phosphorene has also been applied for simultaneous As(III)As(V) removal from water at 
neutral conditions, showing higher adsorption efficiency than graphene (4.820.0 mgg v. 
1.33 mgg)24,25.
