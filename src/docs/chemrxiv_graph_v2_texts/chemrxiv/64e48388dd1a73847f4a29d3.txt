Description:
Incorporated abnormally into DNA due to TS inhibition.

Text:
The component of cell death produced by TS inhibition is abnormal uracil incorporation into DNA 
resulting from buildup of the cytotoxic nucleotide intermediate dUTP and the dUTP pools 
accumulate. DNA polymerases use dUTP in place of TTP during DNA synthesis and activating 
repeated rounds of uracil repair due to continue dTTP depletion, resulting in extensive DNA damage 
and cell death. The enzyme deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), encoded by 
the DUT gene, which hydrolysing dUTP to dUMP, thereby eliminating dUTP from the DNA 
biosynthetic pathway. Even though the depletion of dTMP and the accumulation of dUMP is 
common in cancer cell lines undergoing TS inhibition(Wilson et al., 2012),the ability to accumulate 
dUTP varies definitely.
