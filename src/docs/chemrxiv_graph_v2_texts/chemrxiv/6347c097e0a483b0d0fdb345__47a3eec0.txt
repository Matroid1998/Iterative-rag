Description:
Materials whose atomic structure can influence macroscopic mechanical behavior.

Key to sensibly explore this huge
design space, and to find promising materials for specific applications, is therefore to estab
lish causal relationships between the atomic structure of a material on the one hand and
the resulting impact thereof on its macroscopic behavior on the other. This immediately
highlights a first crucial requirement when developing a materialtranscending design tool
it should be able to accurately isolate and quantify the impact of atomiclevel structural
changes on a materials macroscopic behavior. In this work, we will demonstrate that strain
engineering fulfills this requirement by drawing relationships between the atomic structure
and the macroscopic mechanical behavior of any building block material, including MOFs,
COFs, and perovskites, among others.
