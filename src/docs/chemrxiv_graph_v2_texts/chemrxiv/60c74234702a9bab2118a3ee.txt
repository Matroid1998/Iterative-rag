Description:
A reactive group likely involved in toxicological effects.

Text:
Only a few LCMS 
68 
based methods allow to determine and accurately quantify this potent toxin, after having isolated the 
69 
compound from fungal cultures (Liu and Rychlik, 2015; Puntscher et al., 2019a; Puntscher et al., 2018; 
70 
Zwickel et al., 2016). While genotoxic and mutagenic effects of AOH described in vitro (Brugger et al., 
71 
2006) were linked to topoisomerase I and II poisoning (Fehr et al., 2009), the mechanism of action 
72 
related to ATXII has not been elucidated so far. The reactive epoxide of ATXII is likely to be involved 
73 
in toxicological effects. However, even altertoxin I (ATXI, Fig. 1), structurally the same scaffold but 
74 
lacking the epoxide, was reported to be mutagenic to a certain extent in vitro (Schrader et al., 2006).

Description:
Reduced to an alcohol in several cell lines.

While ATXII did not show estrogenic effects in Ishikawa cells (Dellafiora et al., 2018), chemical 
76 
degradation of the compound was suggested in the presence of the anthocyanin delphinidin 
77 
(Aichinger et al., 2018). In several cell lines (Caco2, HCT 116, HepG2 and V79), it has been reported 
78 
that the epoxide of ATXII was reduced to an alcohol resulting in ATXI, which seemed not to be further 
79 
metabolized in Caco2 cells (Fleck et al., 2014a; Fleck et al., 2014b). 80 
In this study, we investigated the fate of ATXII in intact and homogenized tomato fruits during food 
81 
processing steps at a laboratory scale.
