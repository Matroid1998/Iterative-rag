Description:
Synthesized as Gpr120 receptor agonists.

Text:
2Fluoro3methoxy ringsubstituted 1ethenylbenzene is reported in preparation of 
tetrahydropyrrole compounds as D2 receptors and DAT receptors inhibitors 1, as well as 
in synthesis of benzofuranyl substituted phenylalkylcarboxylic acids as Gpr120 receptor 
agonists 2. 3Fluoro5methoxy benzaldehyde was used in sequential IrCumediated 
method for the metaselective CH radiofluorination of heteroarenes 3; in synthesis and 
styrene copolymerization of ringdisubstituted isopropyl 4 and butyl 5 
phenylcyanoacrylates.
