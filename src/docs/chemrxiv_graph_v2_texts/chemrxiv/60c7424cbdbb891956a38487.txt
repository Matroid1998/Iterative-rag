Description:
Transported through cell membranes via ion channels.

Ion channels are an extremely important class of proteins; channels of various types are present in all 
32 
cells, allowing the transport of Na, K, and Ca2 through the cell membrane(1); other channels are 
33 
responsible for transport of other substances, in particular protons(2, 3). Channels have even been 
34 
found in viruses(4, 5). Voltage gated ion channels (VGIC) are a particular class of channels, and certain 
35 
types of these are responsible for the nerve impulse, as well as the properties of other excitable tissue(6
36 
8). VGIC, both for Na and K, have four voltage sensing domains (VSD); for the K channels, these 
37 
are identical, while for Na they are similar (one having a different function).

Description:
A channel with four transmembrane helical segments involved in voltage sensing.

Here we will be 
38 
concerned with the way a K channel senses voltage. Each VSD of a Na or K channel has four 
39 
transmembrane (TM) helical segments, linked by extra or intracellular loops that extend beyond the 
40 
membrane. The fourth TM helix (labeled S4) is connected via a linker of several amino acids to a 
41 
domain with 8 TM helices, 2 extending from each VSD, that together form the pore through which the 
42 
ion passes. Channels of the type we are discussing are closed when there is a voltage of approximately 
43 
70 mV, (minus meaning intracellular side negative with respect to the extracellular side), that holds 
44 
the channel closed; with 0 mV across the channel, it is open. Fig.
