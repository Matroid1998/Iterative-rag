Description:
Promotes the oxidation of Zn(0) to Zn(II) in a gas mixture.

of CO2. However, the change observed is periodic, and 
is directly correlated with contact between the catalyst and the different gas compositions. Con
sidering the differences between components 1  2 (Figure 4, left), the relative sign of the 
change between the pure spectra  that is, the decreased intensity of the shoulder feature in the 
rising edge and the white line intensity (illustrated by the difference spectrum), suggests that 
some Zn(0) is oxidized to Zn(II) upon exposure to CO2 (Figure 4). Notably, this change is 
shown to be reversible over a series of switches, illustrating that the oxidation (dealloying) 
process is promoted by CO2 in the gas mixture (i.e. gas phase composition alters the distribution 
of Zn within the catalyst).
