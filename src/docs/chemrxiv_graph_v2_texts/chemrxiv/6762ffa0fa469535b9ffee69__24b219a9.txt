Description:
A cathode material with a capacity of 200 mAh g1.

On the cathode side in particular, the industry has moved from Lithium Cobalt 
Oxide (LCO, 140 mAh g1) to LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC111, 160 mAh g1) to 
LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811, 200 mAh g1).2 Olivine phosphate materials (such as 
LiFePO4, LFP with 170 mAh g1) have also been widely studied academically and adopted 
commercially, particularly for applications which value lowcost, high safety and long lifetime. They had historically, however, been unable to compete with NMC layered oxides in terms of 
energy density, and thus their impact within the rapidly growing EV sector was secondary.3 
This paradigm has been broken in recent years due to impressive developments in cell and 
system design, whereby cellautomotive manufacturers (such as BYD) have taken
