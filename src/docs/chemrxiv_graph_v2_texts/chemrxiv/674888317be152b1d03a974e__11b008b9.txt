Description:
A type of heterohelicene synthesized by the Wynberg group.

Text:
A common feature in many helicenes mentioned above is 
the inclusion of a heteroatom into the helical backbone.30 This 
is often highlighted by studies as crucial in influencing the 
physical and optoelectronic properties of a helicene.13,3133 
However, there are relatively few studies dedicated solely 
towards investigating synthetic strategies for making a wider 
range of heterohelicenes based on N, O, and Sheterocycles. Existing examples include photochemical methodologies as 
applied to the synthesis of azahelicenes by the Carrona 
group34,35 and a variety of thiahelicenes synthesised by the 
Wynberg group.3638 Mallory photocyclisations39 are one of the 
most common strategies to access heterohelicenes but non
photochemical methodologies such as the Scholl reaction,4042 
oxidative couplings,43 and 222 cycloisomerisations4446 have 
also been reported.
