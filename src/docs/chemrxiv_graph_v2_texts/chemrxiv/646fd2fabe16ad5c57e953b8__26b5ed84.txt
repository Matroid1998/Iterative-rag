Numerous U.S. domestic and international initiatives 1,2 have increased focus on GHG emis
32
sions reductions. In the U.S., the National Climate Task Force has set groundbreaking
33
goals to reduce domestic GHG emissions 5052 below 2005 levels by 2030. 3 These eorts
34
have focused attention on reducing methane emissions; methane is the second most common
35
greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2), and has a global warming potential (GWP) 86 4
36
times that of CO2 on a 20 year basis. 37
The oil and gas (OG) supply chain represents a substantial source of methane emis
38
sions, notably from the production, transport, and use of natural gas.

Description:
A significant greenhouse gas emitted from midstream facilities, particularly from compressors and compressor drivers.

In many cases, the largest methane emitters at midstream facilities are from compressors
48
and compressor drivers.5,9,10 Gas processing plants and some gathering compressor stations
49
include additional processing equipment to upgrade gas to pipeline quality, such as dehydra
50
tors, acid gas removal units, and associated ares and tanks. Most midstream facilities also
51
include miscellaneous equipment to support pipelines, fuel systems, and similar functions. 11
52
Finally, storage facilities also include wells and wellhead equipment to store gas in under
53
ground reservoirs. This study includes eight transmission compressor stations, ve gathering
54
compressor stations, one gas processing plant, and one underground storage facility. 55
Multiple recent studies have characterized methane emissions from the OG sector, pri
56
marily focusing on emissions in production basins.
