Description:
Can occupy crystallographic sites within cubic symmetry unit cells in LNMO spinel structure.

Text:
In LNMO spinel structure, Ni and Mn can occupy either a single 
crystallographic site or two different ones within cubic symmetry 
unit cells. The first unit cell is described in the Fd3m space group 
and associated with a disordered (statistical) distribution of transi
tion metal ions, whereas the second one is described in the P4332 
space group and associated with a 13 ordering between the two 
transition metal ions. The disordered LNMO is generally obtained 
via hightemperature solidstate syntheses ( 900C), inevitably 
next to a rocksalttype impurity such as NiO and LixNi1xO.4 The 
formation of this mixture of phases is driven by the oxygen loss 
from the stoichiometric phase LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 at such elevated tem
peratures.
