Description:
Alkenes are substrates for terminal hydroxylation or epoxidation by alkane monooxygenase.

Text:
Alkane monooxygenase (AlkB) is an integral membrane metalloenzyme thought to be responsible for 
catalyzing the oxidation of medium chain length linear alkanes in the environment.114 First identified and 
partially purified in the late 1960s15, it was gradually recognized as a member of the classIII diiron proteins, 
along with membrane spanning fatty acid desaturases, fatty acid hydroxylases, xylene monooxygenase, UndB, 
C4 methyl sterol oxidase, and bcarotene ketolase.1623 Key studies over the ensuing decades mapped the 
substrate scope of the enzyme, which favors terminal hydroxylation or epoxidation of straight chain alkanes or 
alkenes with limited tolerance for cyclic alkanes.2430 
For more than 50 years, the tertiary structure of AlkB was not known.
