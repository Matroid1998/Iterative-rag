Description:
A reactive element involved in oxidation processes and forming stable phases upon decomposition.

Text:
Most materials inevitably oxidize in terrestrial environments.1 However, oxidation into a 
selfpassivating phase can protect the bulk from further decomposition. To be effective, the self
passivating phase must be thermodynamically stable with respect to further oxidation and 
mechanically matched to the parent material to form a continuous layer that blocks further 
oxygen. The former can be estimated by determining the most stable phases upon decomposition 
in oxygen, and the latter by empirical rules such as the PillingBedworth ratio (PBR) (i.e., that 
the ratio in the molar volume of the two materials is between 1 and 2).2 Online databases, such as
