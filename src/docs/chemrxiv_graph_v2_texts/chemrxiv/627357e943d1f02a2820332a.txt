Global climate changes represent a serious threat to humans. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) report expected that the mean global temperature will rise by 1.9 C in 
2100 (httpswww.ipcc.ch). It is estimated that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will 
be increased to 950 ppm by 2100 (the present value of 400 ppm; httpswww.ipcc.ch). The 
changes in the climate temperature are irreversible, causing a real threat to the environment and 
humankind. The emission of gases is one of the most causes of global climate change111. Gases 
can be classified as incondensable inorganic gases (i.e., hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), 
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and noble gases such as HeKr) and 
condensable organic gases (i.e., methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), ethene (C2H4)).
