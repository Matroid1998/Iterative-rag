Description:
An important organic acid involved in the metabolic cycle of animals and used in various industries.

Text:
Glyoxylic acid (GA) is an important organic acid in the chemical, cosmetic, 
pharmaceutical, and food industries. It is found in plants and involved in the 
metabolic cycle of animals. Glyoxylic acid is produced in several ways; by nitric 
acid oxidation of glyoxal, by catalytic oxidation of ethylene or acetaldehyde, and by 
electrochemical reduction of oxalic acid 1. The determination of glyoxylic acid in its electrochemical synthesis reaction mixture 
is a difficult process because this mixture contains carboxylic acids with convergent 
acidic dissociation constants and other compounds carrying organic groups that can 
undergo oxidation or reduction such as ethylene glycol, glyoxal and glycolic acid.

Description:
Reacts with tryptophan to form a crimson-violet color that absorbs at 540-545 nm.

Thus, it is expected that glyoxylic acid will be very difficult to determine 
quantitatively using traditional analytical methods such as acidbase or redox 
titrations, separation, or precipitation 2, 3. This paper provides a simple, reliable, and inexpensive spectrophotometric method 
for determination of glyoxylic acid in such reaction mixtures directly without the 
need of separation. The method depends on a colored chromogen product formation 

between glyoxylic acid and tryptophan when they react according to a reaction 
discovered in 1901 by Hopkins and Cole 4, see eq. (1). They suggested that one 
molecule of glyoxylic acid can react with two molecules of tryptophan to give a 
crimsonviolet color that absorbs at 540545 nm. This reaction ideally occurs in an 
anhydrous medium pledged by concentrated sulphuric acid 58.
