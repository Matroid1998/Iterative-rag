Description:
A ligand with relatively weak binding strength and stability gain.

However, the binding strengths of typical 
ligands, such as oleic acid or oleylamine, as well as their stability gain are relatively weak8 , which 
has motivated the search for other methods of stabilization, such as encapsulation9,10, doping11 or 
the use of ligands with a higher binding strength.12,13 Krieg et al.14 have demonstrated the 
advantages of using zwitterionic ligands, which bind strongly to LHP NCs and provide a 
significantly higher stabilization. However, these ligands contain long alkylchains which  just 
like the aforementioned encapsulation strategies  lead to electrically mostly insulating LHP NCs, 
severely hindering their application in LEDs. We hypothesize that this issue may be resolved by replacing the long alkylchains with 
conjugated systems, which should increase the electrical conductivity of the NCs. To this end, a
