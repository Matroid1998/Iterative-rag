Description:
Forms part of the H2 molecule, where 1s-type functions on two hydrogen atoms exhibit constructive and destructive interference.

Text:
Localized virtuals, such as the
redundant nonorthogonal basis of atomic orbitals projected into the virtual space,8,9 permit
development of ecient local correlation methods, because the amplitude tensors describing
correlation become sparse.10 Other prescriptions for localized orthogonal virtuals exist,1113
as well as proposals to form sets of virtuals that are specically optimized for correlations
that involve a given occupied level, as will be discussed below. The virtual orbitals span the entire unoccupied space, which can be contrasted with
the intuitive notion of antibonding orbitals that exist in 11 correspondence with bonding
orbitals. The 11 correspondence is evident from constructive and destructive interference of
a pair of 1stype functions on two hydrogen atoms in H2
