Text:
The Piperazines or cyclizines is a cyclicorganic compound that consists of a six membered ring 
containing two opposing nitrogen atoms. Piperazine exists as small alkaline deliquescent crystals 
and was introduced as a solvent for uric acid. Inside the body the drug is partly oxidized and 
partly eliminated unchanged. Outside the body, piperazine has an ability to dissolve uric acid and 
producing a soluble urate 1,2. Piperazine derivatives used as nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors for the treatment of HIV Virus 3. Aryl piperazine derivatives exhibit a wide class of 
biological activities such as antiarrhythmic 4,5, anticancer 6,7, antiviral 8,9, antioxidative 
10, and antibacterial 11. Compounds of this type show high affinity for dopaminergic 12, 
1adrenergic 13, and serotoninergic receptors 14,15.
