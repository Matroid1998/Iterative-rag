Description:
A versatile platform for the synthesis of furan-based chemicals from hexoses.

Text:
With the increasing demand for fossil resourcederived chemicals and fuels, the viewpoint of developing those 
alternatives from the catalytic transformation of renewable biomass has received global concern.2025 Among the 
alternatives from biomass valorization, the production of 5hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from hexoses is a 
versatile platform for the synthesis of furanbased chemicals such as furyl diamide, diamidine, diimidate, and 
diformylfuran.2627 Therefore, oxidative depolymerization of lignin and lignin model compounds can obtain
