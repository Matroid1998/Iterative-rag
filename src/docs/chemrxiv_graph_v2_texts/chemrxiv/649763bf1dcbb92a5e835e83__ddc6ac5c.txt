Description:
An anode material where oxygen vacancies on surfaces correlate with Li-ion mobility.

These techniques can also be adopted for battery materi
als. For Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) anode material, a correlation was proposed between oxygen
vacancies on electrolyte accessible surfaces and Liion mobility in the bulk of the mate
rial, induced purely by contact of LTO with Liion containing electrolytes. Thereby,
intercalative pseudocapacitance and fastcharging capability may be facilitated.9
Such a relationship was inferred from the T1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relax
ation behavior of 7Li in the anode material when placed in contact with an electrolyte. Lithium ions entered the defectcontaining surface of the material, leading to the
unpinning of paramagnetic polarons associated with these defects. As a consequence,
a T1 change was observed not only on the directly affected surface, but also in the
bulk of the ceramic material.
