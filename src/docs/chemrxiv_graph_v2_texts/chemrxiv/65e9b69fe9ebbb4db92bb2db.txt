Perylene dyes documented applications cover most if not all technologies requiring conju
gated molecular and polymeric materials. Over the last few decades, leading research groups
developed functionalized perylene derivatives with stateoftheart applications in research
fields as diverse as organic transistors, theranostic platforms,1 imaging and bioimaging2 and
photovoltaic technologies.3 Of all perylene dyes related structures, perylenediimides (PDIs)
get the lions share.4 This is without doubt because of their performances, but also due to
wide availability of their common precursor perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA),
a chemical commodity. PDIs are planar, rigid, and symmetric structures featuring char
acteristic spectral signatures efficient and vibronically resolved absorption and emission
profiles, very limited Stokes shift and no net dipole moment. Such features make them ideal
for most but not all applications.
