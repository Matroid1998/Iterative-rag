Description:
A gas whose emissions are measured using aerial survey-based technologies to estimate emission rates.

Text:
There has been a recent push towards the use of measurementinformed inventories for report
ing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, as traditional activitybased, bottomup
inventories have been shown to underestimate emissions.14 This move towards direct mea
surements has been reinforced by regulations in the United States,5,6 the European Union,7
and by global voluntary initiatives.8
Aerial surveybased measurement technologies (sometimes referred to as snapshot mea
surement technologies) are a common method for measuring methane concentrations and
estimating emission rates. These technologies have been evaluated by many controlled re
