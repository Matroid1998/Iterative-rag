Description:
A framework material that can experience temperature transients due to vibrational relaxation.

Text:
The use of CW lasers to simply heat zeolites has been 
explored, 2022 but the ability to synchronously collect time
resolved spectra on the evolution of the sample was not 
implemented.2022 
Similarly, 
picosecond 
pulsedIR 
investigations of zeolites have demonstrated how the 
relaxation of excited OH and OD vibrations induces heating of 
the 
zeolite 
framework, 
and 
quantified 
the 
resulting 
temperature transients, but only considered the heating as an 
unwanted background to the relaxation behaviour on 
picosecond timeframes.23,24 The ability to heat solid materials 
and monitor their evolution from nanoseconds to seconds with 
timeresolved IR remains unexplored. In this paper we describe 
experiments to do exactly this with an approach of pulsedlaser 
Tjumping and timeresolved IR probing for investigating laser 
a.
