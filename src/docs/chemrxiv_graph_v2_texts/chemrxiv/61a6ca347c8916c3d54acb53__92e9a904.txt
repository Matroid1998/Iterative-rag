Description:
Important coproducts produced in biorefinery platforms to offset oil production costs.

There has been growing interest in microalgal cultivation to produce high value compounds with 
potential applications in human health, livestock, aquaculture and biofuels.1 Compounds derived from 
triglycerides and lipids in microalgae are of particular interest as these substances can comprise 20
70 of the dry mass of the organism.1 However, due to high costs involved in lipid downstream 
processing, biorefinery platforms typically produce other important coproducts such as 
polysaccharides, proteins, terpenes, phenolics and alkaloids to offset the oil production costs.1 For 
lipidintensive production, single cell oils from cultured microalgae are of particular interest as they 
offer an alternative to plantbased lipids that require land use.1 In this context, heterotrophic 
thraustochytrids could be a potential source of useful tryglycerides and due to their amenability to the 
tuning of the oil profile through various fermentation and metabolic influences.
