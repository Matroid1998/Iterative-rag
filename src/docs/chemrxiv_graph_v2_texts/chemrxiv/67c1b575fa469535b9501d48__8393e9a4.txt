Description:
Used as an oxide surface in model electrodes.

To lower these discrepancies, we had started a series of combined experimental and 
theoretical model studies. Aiming at a molecularatomiclevel understanding of the 
processes at the electrodeelectrolyte interface of Liion batteries, we had explored the

1butyl1
methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMPTFSI) as solvent, Li as charge 
carrying shuttle ion and structurally well defined, singlecrystalline model electrodes of 
varying chemical activity such as Ag(111) or Au(111),2730, Cu(111),3032 graphite (0001) 30;33

involved a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging and photoelectron 
spectroscopy (PES) measurements of the different adsorbate covered surfaces resulting after
