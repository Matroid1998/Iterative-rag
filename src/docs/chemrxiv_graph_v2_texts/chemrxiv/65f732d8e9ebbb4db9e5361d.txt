Description:
Investigated for its relaxation dynamics in aqueous form using XUVTRPES.

Text:
how the excess energy is efficiently dissipated in a nondestructive manner before inducing 
bond cleavage that can lead to biological damage.611 A better understanding of the processes 
at the molecular level is crucial not only for a bottomup understanding biological effects of 
the UV light, but for elucidating the reasons for the selection of nucleobases as the elements of 
building blocks that define the genetic code.12, 13 To this end, we have applied extreme 
ultraviolet timeresolved photoelectron spectroscopy (XUVTRPES) to investigate the 
relaxation dynamics of aqueous adenine (Ade), its nucleoside adenosine (Ado), and nucleotide 
adenosine5monophosphate (AMP), the structures of which, including two tautomeric forms 
of Ade, are shown in Scheme 1. Scheme 1. Molecular structures of (a) 9HAde, (b) 7HAde, (c) Ado, and (d) AMP.
