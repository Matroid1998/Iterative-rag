Important catalysts in various industrial applications, including fuel cells, catalytic converters, and chemical synthesis.

Text:
Platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) have emerged as important catalysts in various industrial
applications, including fuel cells, catalytic converters, and chemical synthesis. However, the
longterm performance of Pt NPs can be compromised when exposed to reactive conditions
such as the acidic environment in protonexchange membrane hydrogen fuel cells, potentially
