Description:
A class of dyes where a charge is delocalized over a conjugated skeleton of an odd number of Csp2 atoms.

Polymethines are a fascinating class of dyes in which a positive 
(or negative) charge is delocalized over the conjugated skeleton 
comprised of an odd number of Csp2 atoms between two electron 
donating (andor withdrawing) moieties. In the most interested 
cyanine state (form I, Figure 1), sometimes also called ideal 
polymethine state, the charge is delocalized over the entire 
conjugated backbone with vanished bondlength alternation 
(BLA, i.e. the difference between two adjoining Csp2Csp2 bonds) 
and results in the distinctive absorption spectrum that has been 
extensively studied over the last decades. As shown in Figure 1, 
the absorption spectrum features a sharp, intense absorption 
band with a characteristic highenergy shoulder.
