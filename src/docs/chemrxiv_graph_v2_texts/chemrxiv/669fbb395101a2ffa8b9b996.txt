Description:
A dopant used in nanocrystals to study electronic properties and bandgap widening.

Text:
Thus, dopant effects on the electronic properties of the host 
NC cannot be disentangled from quantum confinement effects. Here, we describe such a method, resulting in sizetuneable NCs doped with highly controlled dopant 
concentrations of various metals tested (Mn2, Ni2, or Zn2), working under ambient conditions at room 
temperature. We validate and quantity lattice doping using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), the 
dopantinduced bandgap widening, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Using 
timeresolved optical spectroscopy, we study the now accessible series of NCs with systematically varied 
size and doping concentration and find surprisingly that the dopinginduced carrier dynamics modulation 
persists independent of the level of quantum confinement. Further, the developed method is simple, 
scalable, and can be performed at room temperature, paving the way for future technological relevance.
