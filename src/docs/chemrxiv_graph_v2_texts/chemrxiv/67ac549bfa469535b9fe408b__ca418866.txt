Description:
Used in solar cells, which experience a degradation in efficiency after a few tens of hours of operation.

Text:
For instance, AgBiS2 solar cells undergo an approximately 20 
degradation in their initial efficiency after only a few tens of hours of operation.3 In contrast, 
the unprecedented efforts on LHPs over the last decade have led to their device operational 
stabilities now reaching a few thousand hours.4 Importantly, such an impressive result has been 
achieved not only through careful engineering at the absorber composition level but also
