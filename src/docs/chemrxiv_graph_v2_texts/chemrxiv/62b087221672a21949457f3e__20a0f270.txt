Description:
Used as a precatalyst for the hydrogenation of imines.

Text:
For example, Beller and coworkers reported the use of zinc triflate, Zn(OTf)2, 
as a precatalyst for the hydrogenation of imines.11 Stephan and coworkers also used a zincbased 
catalyst for the hydrogenation of imines and ketones.12,13 Milstein and coworkers provided an example 
of zinc catalyzed hydrogenation of imines and ketones, using a PNP pincer ligand to facilitate dihydrogen 
activation through metalligand cooperation.14 Despite these reports, the application of zinc to 
hydrogenation catalysis remains understudied, with substrates limited to highly polarized species. Furthermore, the issue of selective hydrogenation with these types of catalysts is yet to be addressed.
