b) Preparation of degradable 
polymers via rROP 
The main family of cyclic monomers used in rROP is cyclic 
ketene acetal (CKA).10, 11 These cyclic monomers have been ex
tensively studied during the last few years, and are very effi
cient for the copolymerization with vinyl monomers such as 
vinyl ether derivatives and vinyl acetate. In the case of the co
polymerization with (meth)acrylate and (meth)acrylamide 
derivatives, the difference in reactivity between the comono
mers led to a lower insertion of the CKA compared to the ini
tial feed ratio and a compositional drift at high conversion.12 
For styrene and dienes, the high difference in reactivity
