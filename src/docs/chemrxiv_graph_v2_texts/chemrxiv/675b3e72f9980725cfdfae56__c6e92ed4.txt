Description:
A family of two-dimensional materials with outstanding electronic, optical, and mechanical properties.

Text:
As a new family of twodimensional (2D) materials discovered in 2011 (1), MXenes have at
tracted great interest for various electronic and optoelectronic applications (24), as they pos
sess outstanding electronic, optical, and mechanical properties (2,5,6). MXenes have the gen
eral chemical formula of Mn1XnTx (n  1 4), where M represents a transition metal, X
carbon andor nitrogen, and Tx surface terminations (F, Cl,
O, OH) (2). Their diversity in
surface termination, ease of functionalization, and stoichiometric composition results in various
tunable properties, broadening the range of their potential applications (711). MXenes have been demonstrated to have high freecarrier density (12) as well as tunable
optical properties (3, 13), making them excellent candidates for optoelectronic devices (2, 14).
