Conversion of solar energy into hydrogenbased fuels is considered to be one of the most 
promising alternatives to fossil fuels.1 Water is an inexpensive and readily available natural 
source of hydrogen, which has made electrochemical water splitting an intensively pursued 
research field in the recent decades.2 However, the anodic reaction that leads to the oxidation 
of water to molecular oxygen is plagued by a high activation barrier, which has steered 
research towards the development of active and durable water oxidation catalysts (WOCs).3 
So far, the most intensively studied type of catalysts are the molecular ones, which have the 
advantage of straightforward structural modification and electronic control.4,5 However, 
molecular catalysts generally suffer from limited stability, which in many cases can be 
improved through attachment of the catalysts onto conductive surfaces, where bimolecular 
decomposition pathways are impeded by restricted translational mobility.6 
Catalysts based on 1st row transition metals are considered to be more attractive for large 
scale industrial applications compared to their 2nd and 3rd row counterparts due to their low 
cost and environmentally benign character.79 However, in practice, higher stability and 
catalytic efficiency have been observed for ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir)based catalysts, 
which have made them the most widely studied.1014 Recently, we reported a highly active Ru
based water oxidation catalyst, Ru(mcbp)(py)2 (mcbp2  2,6bis(1methyl4(carboxylate)
benzimidazol2yl)pyridine, 1 in Figure 1).15 This catalyst shows an impressive maximum 
turnover frequency (TOFmax) of approximately 40 000 s1 (calculated from the footofthe
wave analysis) at pH 9.0,16 which shares the world record in efficiency with a related catalyst 
developed by Llobet and coworkers.17 Given the remarkable performance of this catalyst, we 
became interested in immobilizing it on an electrode for application in electrocatalytic water 
oxidation.
