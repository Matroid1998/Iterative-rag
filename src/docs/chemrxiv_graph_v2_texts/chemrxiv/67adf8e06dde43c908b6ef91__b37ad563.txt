Description:
High viscosity substances used in nanoparticle synthesis.

Text:
The high viscosity of polyols prevent a simple and direct use 
of the Au NPs.30,31 Ethylene glycol is a suitable alternative to glycerol,32 but is still a 
viscous solvent.30 Ethanol presents the main benefit to have a very low viscosity A 
desirable feature to more easily process the NPs, e.g. to deposit the NPs on various 
surfaces to develop heterogeneous catalysts without the need for intensive and waste
generating steps typically requiring strong acids when polyols are used.30 Ethanol
mediated syntheses still lead to rather small ca. 10 nm Au NPs stable for years.16,23 
Nevertheless, the overall kinetics of NP formation are slower and the experimental 
window where the synthesis can be considered successful is narrower than in the case 
of polyolsmediated syntheses.29
