1. Introduction 
Luminescent materials that can be made and processed in the solution phase are in demand for a range of 
present and nextgeneration optoelectronic technologies because of their scalability and ease of integration 
into devices with diverse form factors. Among these, colloidal semiconductors  i.e., dispersions made in 
solution of nanocrystals of the same inorganic materials that are semiconductors in the bulk  stand out as
