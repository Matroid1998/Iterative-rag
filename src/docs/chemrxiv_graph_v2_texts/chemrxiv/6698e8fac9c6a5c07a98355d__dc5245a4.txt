Description:
The first organic semiconductor for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, but displayed low activity.

Solar energy is the most 
favorable alternative to minimize the overexploitation of fossil energy sources.13 The conversion of solar energy 
into hydrogen via artificial photosynthesis using a photocatalyst is a promising and sustainable technology to 
mitigate the global environmental and energy issues.4 
 In 1972, titanium dioxide (TiO2) was first explored in electrochemical photolysis for water splitting by Honda and 
Fujishima and in the following years many other inorganic semiconductors were reported for this purpose.5 The 
first organic semiconductor for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water was presented in 1985 with poly(p
phenylene) but displayed low activity.6 Later, other metalfree systems like polymeric carbon nitrides,7 conjugated 
microporous polymers,8 and covalent triazinebased frameworks9 were developed as photocatalysts for HER from 
water.
