Description:
Reduced to CO with high selectivity and low overpotential by Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters.

Text:
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs), renowned for their unique structures and 
moleculelike properties, have shown exceptional catalytic capabilities due to their 
quantum confinement effects and high density of active sites.4 Among these, 
Au25(SR)18 NCs have been particularly recognized for their significant 
electrocatalytic activities in both CO2 reduction4c, 5 and hydrogen evolution6. The 
pioneering work by Kauffman et al.7 first highlighted Au25(SR)18s ability to 
efficiently reduce CO2 to CO with high selectivity and low overpotential at 
commercially viable current densities, establishing the potential of these nanoclusters 
in electrocatalysis. The bimetallic PtAu24(SR)18 NCs, explored by Kwak et al.,8 
demonstrated the remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen production in HER, 
surpassing previously reported molecular catalysts and even outperforming traditional 
platinum catalysts, setting a new benchmark in the field.
