Description:
Reacts with peroxidase and cytochrome P450 enzymes to form the critical Compound I intermediate.

Text:
Whilst there 
have been computational studies on the reactivity of peroxidase 
and cytochrome P450 enzymes with H2O2, the focus has mainly 
been on formation of the critical Compound I intermediate and 
effects of water molecules.4, 5 From this perspective, one could 
argue that the understanding of the dynamics involved in 
substratemediated proton delivery in peroxidases has barely 
moved on since early ideas were presented 30 or so years ago.6 
The challenge of identifying proton channels is compounded by 
the fact that all peroxidases are capable of binding and oxidising 
several types of substrate, that the substrate binding locations in 
many peroxidases are not known, and that most peroxidases 
probably have more than one binding location for the same sub
strate.7 
Here, we apply several computational molecular modelling and 
simulation approaches to gain mechanistic insights into the pro
ton delivery mechanisms of peroxidases.
