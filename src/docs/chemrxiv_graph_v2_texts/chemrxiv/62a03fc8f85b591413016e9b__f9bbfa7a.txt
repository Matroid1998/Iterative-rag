Through the direct assessment of protein re
actions in a LCMSbased platform, we herein report on 
transstyryl sulfonyl fluoride (SSF) as a near perfect MA for 
Cysspecific protein conjugation. SSF derived functionalities 
were used to generate serum stable protein conjugates effi
ciently, and shows better reactivity than current platforms 
for stable ADC construction in clinical stage. Moreover, SSF 
modified functionalities, e.g., SSF singlestranded DNA 
(ssDNA), are quite stable in aqueous buffer, which provides 
a novel readily reactive reagent for the construction of DNA
protein conjugates (Fig. 1). Further performance character
ization shows the promising translational value of this 
chemistry in preparing protein conjugates for applications 
of singlecell omics and novel ADC therapies.
