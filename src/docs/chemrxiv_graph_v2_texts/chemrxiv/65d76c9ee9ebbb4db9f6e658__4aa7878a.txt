Description:
Used in CH alumination and involves fluoride abstraction.

Text:
The difference in CH alumination using B(ArCF3)4 and 
B(C6F5)4, is consistent with the considerable fluorophilicity of aluminum cations that presumably leads to AlF bond 
formation by fluoride abstraction from the sp3CF3containing anion (note, this is not observed with the zinc congeners 
at 80 C, consistent with the lower fluorophilicity of Zn relative to Al). Table 3. CH alumination of 2methylthiophene.a
