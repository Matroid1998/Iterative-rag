Description:
A valuable class of compounds important in natural products and pharmaceuticals.

Text:
Among diverse Nheterocycles, phthalazines represent a valua
ble class of compounds and are important subunits of a broad 
variety of natural products with remarkable biological activi
ties13 and are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals.46An impressive 
number of known drugs contain a phthalazine core, e.g., hydral
azine (used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure),7 car
bazeran (potent cardiac stimulant)8 and vatalanib (anticancer 
drug)9, 10 and recently reported drug candidate A196 (potent 
and selective inhibitor of protein lysine methyltransferases 
(PKMTs) (Figure 1a).11 
Besides, phthalazinebased compounds are widely employed as 
catalysts12 or ligands in a variety of transition metal com
plexes.1316 Apart from that, they act as key intermediates in or
ganic synthesis.

Description:
Synthesis requires toxic reagents and harsh reaction conditions.

Text:
For instance, they can undergo a thermal rear
rangement reaction towards corresponding quinazolines in high 
yield.17 
Commonly, phthalazine derivatives can be obtained by ring
closing reactions of either odicarbonyl compounds with hydra
zine reagents,18, 19 aromatic aldazines,20 or arylhydrazines21 
maintained in liquid aluminum chloride or by refluxing in pres
ence of zinc chloride. However, these and related methods22, 23 
require mostly toxic reagents and harsh reaction conditions. Therefore, development of new environmentally friendly and 
efficient methodologies for synthesis of substituted phthala
zines is highly desirable. Recently, domino and onepot processes have attracted much 
attention, since they avoid a lengthy separation and purification 
process of intermediate products and, therefore, minimize 
chemical waste and save resources.2428
