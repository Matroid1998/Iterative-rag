Description:
Products of CO2RR catalyzed by copper nanoclusters.

Text:
This realization has paved the way for the 
utilization of transition metalbased nanoclusters (NCs) with precisely defined structural features and 
optimized surface properties for this purpose.6 
 Initially, noble metalbased NCs and their alloys were widely used for this application.7 However, 
despite their welldefined architectures and notable surface properties, these NCs predominantly 
produce CO as the main CORR product, limiting their versatility.7c, 8 In contrast, copper (Cu) NCs 
stand out due to their unique ability to catalyze CO2RR into a wide array of products, including 
hydrocarbons and oxygenates due to their ability to stabilize the intermediates.9 This distinctive 
behavior makes Cu NCs a key focus in the field. Despite their promise, studies on Cu NCs for CORR remain limited.
