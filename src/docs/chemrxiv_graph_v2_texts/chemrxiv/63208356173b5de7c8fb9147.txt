Metal anodes with high volumetric capacity, low cost, and safe operation.

The search for new energy storage technologies to promote electromobility and reduce global
warming is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Magnesiumion batteries (MIB) are
attracting increasing attention as an alternative to conventional lithiumion batteries (LIB)
due to the unique properties of magnesium (Mg) metal anodes, such as high volumetric
capacity, low cost, and safe operation.15 However, mass market adoption of MIBs is cur
rently hindered by significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the formation of
a passivating interface on the Mg surface which is impermeable to Mg cations and leads to
battery failure.68 Sun et al.
