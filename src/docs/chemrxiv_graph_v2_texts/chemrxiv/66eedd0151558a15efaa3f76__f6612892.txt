Description:
A compound where methyl substituents are attached at the four meso positions.

Text:
Based on these results, NiPs and other openshell MPs are now placed on the
roadmap that charts the development of lowZ sensitizers as a templating platform of hot CT
chromophores optimized for boosting endergonic photoconversion schemes. 2. Results
Figure 1a shows the chemical structure of Ni(II) tetrakis(2,4,6trimethylphenyl)porphyrin
(NiTMP), where the methyl substituents are attached at the four meso position (S.I.1). 2
