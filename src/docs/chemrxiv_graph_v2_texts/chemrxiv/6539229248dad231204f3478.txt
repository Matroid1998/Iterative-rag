Description:
Inorganic compounds used as positive electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries, obtained from nonrenewable and limited resources.

Text:
Lithiumion batteries have been widely used in electronic devices because of their high energy 
density.1,2 However, commercial Liion batteries contain inorganic transition metal oxides as positive 
electrode materials, which are obtained from nonrenewable and limited resources from the Earths 
crust.3,4 Compared to transition metal oxides, organic electrode materials (OEMS) have many 
advantages, such as low cost, environmental friendliness, resource sustainability and the structural 
tunability, which makes them potential candidates for next generation green batteries.511 In 
particular allorganic batteries, operating metalfree, would be attractive for more sustainable energy 
storage solutions.12,13 
Based on the charge storage mechanism, OEMs can be classified into three types.14 (i) ntype 
(redox reaction occurs between the neutral and negatively charged state with cation uptake from the 
electrolyte), (ii) ptype (redox reaction occurs between the neutral and positively charged state with 
anion uptake from the electrolyte),15 (iii) bipolar.
