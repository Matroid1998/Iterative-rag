Description:
Considered as an option for energy storage to deliver energy in peak demand periods.

Text:
One challenge inherent to an increased 
share of renewable energy generation is their intermittent 
availability. Whilst interconnectors between countries have 
partially addressed the mismatch in renewable energy 
generation and demand, there is an associated risk with relying 
on other countries to supply energy, as exposed during the 
recent crisis in global supply chains of natural gas5. Therefore, 
the most viable solution to address the mismatch between peak 
demand and peak supply of electricity is to consider energy 
storage during periods when supply exceeds demand. Whilst 
energy storage solutions including batteries and pumped 
storage are currently being deployed, options including 
hydrogen will be needed to achieve the goal of energy security 
and to deliver energy in peak demand periods 68.
