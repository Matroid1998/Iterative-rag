Description:
Compounds that condense with halophosphine derivatives to form seven-membered PN rings.

Text:
The most 
common approach for preparing sevenmembered 
PN rings relies on the condensation of amines with 
halophosphine derivatives, with concomitant release 
of HCl, which necessarily affords products with direct 
PN bonds.911 There are fewer examples of PN 
heterocycles that contain solely PC bonds, but 
heteroocycles fo this type recently have been applied 
as ligands for Ni in electrocatalysts or as chelating 
ligands for lanthanide ions,1214 and in medicinal 
applications (Figure 1A).15 Azaphosphepines are 
unsaturated sevenmembered PN heterocycles, and 
convenient and highyielding synthetic routes to such 
heterocycles remain limited in scope. The most 
pertinent examples of azaphosphepine synthesis for 
this current study are ringexpansions via PN 
cleavage of an appropriate fivemembered ring 
precursor. In 1990, Ried et al.
