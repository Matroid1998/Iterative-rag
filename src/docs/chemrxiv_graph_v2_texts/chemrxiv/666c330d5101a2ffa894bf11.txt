A diverse class of crystalline microporous silicates with superior adsorption, ion exchange, and catalysis properties.

Text:
Zeolites are a diverse class of crystalline microporous silicates,
with a wide range of pore shapes, connectivities and framework
topologies. These materials are of enormous industrial impor
tance for their superior adsorption, ion exchange, and catalysis
properties, and the benefits of tuning these properties to particu
lar applications provide a strong incentive to tailor their synthe
