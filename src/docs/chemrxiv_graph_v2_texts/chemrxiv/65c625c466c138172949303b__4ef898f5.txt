Description:
Produced through the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction during water splitting.

Text:
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a fundamental process of water 
splitting to produce hydrogen, is an efficient and sustainable way to convert electrical energy 
into chemical energy.1 Naturally occurring enzymes such as hydrogenase, can effectively 
facilitate reversible interconversion of protons and H2.

Description:
Generated with 92 faradaic efficiency mediated by hydrogen bonding.

Text:
These complexes were observed to catalyse the generation of H2 with 92 faradaic 
efficiency mediated by hydrogen bonding facilitated by protoncoupled electron transfer 
process.15 Recently, Cao and coworkers explored different mechanistic aspects of HER using 
a Ni(II)containing porphyrin bearing four pentafluorophenyl groups.16 They proposed that Ni
H species formed by oxidative protonation of the one electron reduced species followed by a 
rapid bimetallic homolysis as a plausible mechanistic pathway for the electrogeneration of H2.
