Description:
A catalyst used in alkane dehydrogenation that can suffer from coke formation due to lack of selectivity.

Text:
The formation of coke, or carbonaceous deposits, is a persistent problem for dehydrogena
tion catalysts, as it results in their rapid deactivation. Deactivation is typically attributed
to physical blocking of active sites on the catalyst. Coke formation on Ptbased alkane de
hydrogenation catalysts originates from the lack of selectivity of the catalyst; side reactions
for deeper dehydrogenation past alkenes and CC cracking contribute to coke formation. Approaches to preventing coke formation include cofeeding H2,1 changing Pt nanoparticle
size,2 and dopants or promoters such as Sn,35 Ge,6,7 Si,8 Ga,911 Zn,12 and B.1315 These
approaches all favor desorption of the desired alkenes over deeper dehydrogenation (or crack
ing) reactions.
