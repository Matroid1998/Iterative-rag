Description:
An activated form that covalently binds with the HK ATPase enzyme, causing irreversible inhibition of acid excretion.

Text:
This is shown by the following formula 

Acidic environment is required for PPI to undergo rearrangement for the active form. The PPIs 
become protonated in the acidic environment, that give rise to activated sulphonamide form which 
ties covalently with the HK ATPase enzyme. This causes irreversible inhibition of acid excretion 
by the pump5. Therefore these drugs are really helpful for the remedy of acid caused inflammation 
condition as well as abscesses of the stomach and duodenum, gastroesophageal reflux illness, all 
produced by stomach acid6. Omeprazole is one of the wellknown proton pump7,8 inhibitor (PPIs) 
with molecular formula C17H19N3O3S. The IUPAC name of omeprazole is (6methoxy2(4

3 

methoxy3,5dimethylpyridin2yl) methane sulfinyl1H1,3benzodiazole). Omeprazole is 
slightly basic.
