Description:
A polyester polymer that can be fully degraded by engineered hydrolases for recycling and bioremediation purposes.

Moreover, 
enzymes can display different hydrolytic kinetics for different 
monomers depending on the neighboring monomer within the 
polymer sequence. Therefore, available and novel hydrolases 
could be applied to characterize the microstructure of synthetic 
polymers similarly to what is done for the characterization of 
proteins (i.e., chemoselective digestion). The capability of some hydrolases to degrade synthetic 
polyesters has been investigated over the past two decades, 
leading to the discovery and engineering of variants that can fully 
degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polyester polymer and, 
therefore, potentially be used for recycling and bioremediation 
purposes. The enzymes used for this purposes were cutinases 
isolated from microbial strains (e.g.
