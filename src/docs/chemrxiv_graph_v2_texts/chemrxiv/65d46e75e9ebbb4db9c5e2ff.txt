In this configuration, the semiconductors key role involves absorbing incident
photons, creating electronhole pairs, and easing their separation and transportation.5 De
pending on the application, the semiconductor can be employed as particles ranging from
micrometer to nanometer dimensions in a solution or as a photoelectrode.6 The latter setup
typically involves a transparent and conducting oxide material with the semiconductor de
posited as a thin film.6,7 To accomplish practicalscale photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactions,
the photoelectrode should comprise of lowcost as well as abundant and nontoxic materi
als.2 Semiconducting transition metal oxides provide a wide array of electronic properties,
enabling the possibility of customizing each electrodes band gap and absolute energy level
alignment according to the specific electrochemical requirements.
