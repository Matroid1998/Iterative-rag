Description:
Material with nanopores used in iodine-based electrochemical energy storage devices.

Text:
The 
16 
rather slow selfdischarge of iodinebased electrochemical energy storage devices is currently attributed to 
17 
immobile I3 and I5 confined in the narrow carbon pores of below 1 nm diameter7,8,18. However, based on the 
18 
known reaction mechanism on planar platinum electrodes16,17 and the use of battery electrodes with physically 
19 
impregnated I26,7, alternative electrodeposition of solid I2 in carbon nanopores ought to be considered. 20 
Resolving the mechanism requires in situ techniques with chemical and structural sensitivity for all involved 
21 
species in the nanoporous carbon. In situ Raman spectroscopy probes species in electrochemical cells2123 and 
22 
is sensitive to polyiodides (I3, I5)2427.

Description:
Nanopores that confine iodine species during polarization.

Text:
In situ Raman and ex situ ultravioletvisible (UVvis) spectroscopy 
30 
confirm I2, I3 and I5 during positive polarization and their reduction into I during negative polarization. In 
31 
situ SAXSWAXS data show that a majority of these species is confined to the carbon nanopores. Combined 
32 
with stochastic modeling, in situ SAXS quantifies the amount of solid iodine deposit and visualizes its 
33 
structural evolution in the pores. Based on the derived reaction mechanism, we show that high capacity with 
34 
low selfdischarge requires a small concentration of mobile polyiodides and a large fraction of immobile iodine 
35 
deposits. 36
