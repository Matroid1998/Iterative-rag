transferring cells out of growth medium and into specic aqueous
solutions, which either contain calcium ions or are of particularly
low conductivity. In the case of a chemical transformation, pores
in the cells membrane are formed through the interplay of chem
icals and a heat shock,1 whereas during electroporation pores
form in the cell membrane during an electric shock.2 Once the
pores have formed, the genetic material can enter the cell, where
it can either propagate independently from the chromosome in
the form of a plasmid or is introduced into the chromosome and
in the process causes specic mutations (e.g.
