Description:
An electrolyte for which the Pitzer and Bromley approaches fail to describe activity coefficients.

man, Pitzer and coworkers extended the description to more complex electrolyte
mixtures such as seawater.14 A special issue of the Journal of Fluid Phase
Equilibria15 celebrates the 100th anniversary of the findings by Debye and Huckel
and provides a summary of recent developments on the topic. In that issue Simonin
and Bernard16 compare several simple activity models including DebyeHuckel,
the mean spherical approximation and the Pitzer approach. Earlier, Khan et al.17
compared four physical descriptions of ln . While the Pitzer and Bromley ap
proaches describe the activity coefficients of the 11 electrolytes well, the methods
fail for several important 12 electrolytes such as CaCl2 and MgCl2.
