Description:
Isostructural with antimony, alloys with alkali metals, and is more ductile than antimony.

Antimony and its alloys have been intensively studied in recent years as highcapacity anode 
materials in alkali metalion based rechargeable batteries.110 It has a theoretical storage capacity 
of 660 mAhg, which is almost twice as high as graphite (372 mAhg) that is currently used in 
commercial lithiumion batteries (LIB), and double that of hard carbon in emerging sodiumion 
batteries.1113 Recently, antimonybased anodes have been extended to include potassiumion 
batteries.14,15 The range of antimonyalkali compounds that has been characterized is, however, 
considerably broader than just these two elements, and can include up to three alkali metal ions 
from group I, from lithium to cesium, with the number of intermediate compounds increasing as 
one moves down the group of the periodic table.16,17 In contrast to the more widely studied tin 
anodes, antimony shows good performance in conventional commercial carbonatebased 
electrolytes, making it a more suitable candidate to replace graphite in LIBs.1820 
Bismuth is isostructural with antimony and the elements have full mutual solid 
solubility above 200 C.17 However, thermodynamic calculations suggest there is a miscibility 
gap below 140 C.21 Like antimony, bismuth also alloys with up to three molar equivalents of 
alkali metals from lithium to cesium.16,17 Since bismuth is much more ductile than antimony, it 
makes the material less susceptible to fracture during electrochemical cycling with lithium, and 
there are several examples of bismuth addition to antimony improving the cycling stability 
relative to either element by itself.2,8 Although insitu diffraction data of the individual elements 
during lithiation are available and show that A3Bi and A3Sb (A  Li, Na, K) are isostructural,15,22
25 no such data exist on binary SbBi solid solutions.

Description:
Has a lithiation potential less positive than that of antimony, indicating lower thermodynamic stability.

In addition, no ternary phase diagrams 
obtained via metallurgical routes have been reported.17 
Solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a highly sensitive 
method to interrogate local atomic chemical environments and is therefore suitable to study subtle 
compositional variations on short length scales ( 10 ) in a multicomponent alloy. Such so

positive than that of bismuth,8 indicating higher thermodynamic stability, which could result in 
the formation of Sbrich clusters.
