Also,
many forms of designed catalysts have been considered for catalytic conversion of harmless (CO2) and harmful
(CO) to highvalueadded chemicals and fuels in order to decrease the use of fossil fuels and as well as limit the
impact of toxic gases in our environment 9,10. Moreover, the electrochemical conversion of alcohol fuels such
as methanol (C1), ethanolethylene glycol (C2), glycerolpropanol (C3), and other fuels, have been extensively
studied for fuel cell applications, utilizing unlisted materials which include supported , coreshell, unsupported
metallic nanoparticles, metal oxides, and as well as metal oxyhydroxides as described in these research papers
11,16.
