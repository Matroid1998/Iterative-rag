Bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs), recognized as the smallest bicyclic structures, have considerable 
synthetic value due to their high strain energy (64 kcalmol).1420 In recent years, they have found 
extensive use in cycloaddition reactions, leading to a diverse array of novel bridged bicyclic2134 or 
polycyclic 3D scaffolds.3547 These scaffolds serve as bioisosteric replacements for flat aromatic 
rings. The rigidity of these frameworks allows for precise orientation of their peripheral 
substituents, enabling the imitation of disubstitution or polysubstitution patterns found in 
monocyclic aromatic structures such as benzene or pyridine derivatives. However, innovation in 
new scaffolds to mimic other polycyclic aromatics using BCB chemistry has received far less 
attention. Bicyclo3.1.1heptane (BCHep), in particular, has recently gained significant interest for its
