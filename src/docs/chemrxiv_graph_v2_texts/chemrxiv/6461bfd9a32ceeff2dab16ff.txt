Ionic Liquids (ILs) are mixtures of cations and anions forming salts that are liquid at room
temperature, remaining in that phase even at high temperatures.1,2 The first ionic liquid
was reported in 1914 by Paul Walden, synthesized by neutralization of ethylamine with
concentrated nitric acid, resulting in ethylamonium nitrate salt,3 EtNH3NO3.
