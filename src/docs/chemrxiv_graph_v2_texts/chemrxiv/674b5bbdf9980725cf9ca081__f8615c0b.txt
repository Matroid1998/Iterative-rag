Description:
A high-energy product generated during photosynthesis.

Text:
The most relevant process of lightenergy conversion in nature is photosynthesis, which takes place 
within the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane is a 
lipid bilayer that assembles multiple protein supercomplexes in a transmembrane fashion to absorb 
light and transfer electrons across the membrane to generate highenergy products such as NADPH 
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen) and carbohydrates as well as oxygen as a 
side product.1 The benefit of transmembrane electron transfer is that the oxidation site is physically 
separated from the reduction site and that such compartmentalization can finetune local reaction 
conditions to prevent detrimental recombination.2,3 Additionally, the transmembrane charge 
transfer generates a proton gradient which fuels the ATP synthase (ATP  adenosine triphosphate, 
see Figure 1a).4,5
