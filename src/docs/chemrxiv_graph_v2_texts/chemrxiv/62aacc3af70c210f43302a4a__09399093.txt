Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic chemicals with hundreds 
48 
of applications in industry and consumer products 1, 2. PFAS have been extensively used 
49 
because of the special properties, like high chemical and thermal stability, surfactant and water 
50 
and oil repelling properties 3. Due to their widespread use and stability, PFAS are ubiquitous 
51 
in the environment. Humans are easily exposed to these substances through food and drinking 
52 
water consumption, dust ingestion, air inhalation and dermal contact 4. Exposure to PFAS 
53 
can result in adverse health effects, that have been observed both in toxicological 510 and 
54 
epidemiological studies 1117.
