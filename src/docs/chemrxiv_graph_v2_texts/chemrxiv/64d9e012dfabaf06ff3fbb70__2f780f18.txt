Description:
Exhibits improved class I HDAC selectivity and lower toxicity compared to hydroxamate-based HDACi.

In addition, they are associated with cellular mutagenicity and genotoxicity 17. Compared with hydroxamatebased HDACi, the 2aminobenzamide HDACi exhibit improved 
class I HDAC selectivity and lower toxicity (Fig. 1) 18, 19. Several clinical studies revealed 
that hematological toxicities associated with HDACi may limit their therapeutic window, and 
this is a main reason to exclude several potent candidates from further drug development 20
22. Therefore, cellspecific inhibition of such epigenetic targets could be a promising 
strategy to overcome offtarget side effects. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023hrxsl ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000259859261 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
