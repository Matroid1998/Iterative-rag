Description:
A component of ordinary Portland cement that reacts with water to influence early viscoelastic properties.

The reactivity of the cementitious binder in the first minutes of hydration is crucially important for the
20
fresh properties of concrete. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the initial reactions of
21
the main ordinary Portland cement (OPC) components is relevant for precisely controlling the hydration
22
kinetics and the rheological parameters of (blended) cements. 23
The early viscoelastic properties of OPCbased materials, such as concrete, are significantly influenced
24
by the reactions involving tricalcium aluminate (C3A) 13. In the first minutes of hydration, the reaction
25
of C3A, which typically constitutes up to 10 wt. of OPC 4, 5, with water leads to the precipitation of
26
calciumaluminatehydrates (CAH, AFm phases). If not adequately controlled, this process results in a
27
swift decline in workability.
