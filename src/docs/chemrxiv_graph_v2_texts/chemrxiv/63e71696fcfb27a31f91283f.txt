Description:
Forms dots that exhibit hypsochromic shift under hydrostatic pressure.

Although 
some mechanisms have been proposed, the relationship between fluorescent properties and various stimuli still 
remains ambiguous. Thus, making a clear picture for the underlying mechanism will be of significance for 
rational molecular design in the solid state. From previous works, it is found that most of the reported MC materials present a bathochromicshifted 
and reduced photoluminescence (PL) intensity with increasing pressure 1821, which is mainly due to generate 
a lowenergy emission species with a narrow bandgap. To date, only scattered cases on hypsochromicshifted 
emission have been reported upon mechanical stimuli 2227. For example, Zou and coworkers prepared 
several carbon dots showing obvious hypsochromicshift under hydrostatic pressure 2224. However, due to 
no clear structural information, their structureproperty relationship is quite difficult to investigate at molecular
