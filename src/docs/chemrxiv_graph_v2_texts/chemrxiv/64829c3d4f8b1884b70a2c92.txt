Description:
Used in fiber form to reinforce polymer matrices in composites, providing high tensile strength and low weight for structural applications.

Text:
Carbon ber reinforced composites (CFRCs) can replace traditional engineering metals in
weightcritical applications due to their relatively low weights and high tensile strengths. More
recently, CFRCs have been used in structural applications as a strategy for reducing global
emissions in the transport and aerospace sectors 13. The mechanical performance of CFRC
materials is due to the impressive mechanical properties of the carbon ber (CF) itself, which
is used to reinforce a polymer matrix to produce composite material for suitable for structural
applications. The juncture between the CF and the polymer matrix has been long recognized
as a key factor in the ultimate mechanical performance of the composite 47.
