Hence, the aforementioned 
preparation method becomes quite appealing for preparing suitable Nibearing 
electrodes directly on nickel substrates, owing to its simplicity and effectiveness. In this work, we have investigated the OER performance of selected Fecoated 
Ni meshes (NM) prepared by directly immersing the respective Ni mesh in Fe
bearing solutions. Indeed, we were able to detect an enhancement of the OER 
performance for all of our samples. Our insitu Raman spectroscopic studies have 
captured the potentialinduced oxidation of Ni preceding the OER process. Careful 
analysis of the obtained Raman data has uncovered a direct link between the activity 
of the NM electrode and the Raman response of the active phase.
