Description:
Contain Si-O-Si bond angles similar to those in imidazolates.

The imidazolates structuredirecting effect arises from 
the close resemblance of the metalimidazolatemetal bond angle (around 145) to 
the SiOSi bond angle observed in silicates and zeolites.3 ZIFs are often subject to 
studies focusing on gas physisorption and separation applications due to their porous 
nature combined with a rather high chemical and thermal stability inherent to some 
members of this class of materials.4,5 In the last decade many ZIF structures have been 
reported including mixed linker and mixed metal ZIFs68 that feature different metal 
ions, such as Fe2,9 Cd2,10,11 Mn2,12 and Mg2.13 By formal substitution of half of the 
divalent metal ions by trivalent B3 and the other half by monovalent metal ions, such 
as Cu or Li, a related class of materials denoted as boron imidazolate frameworks 
(BIFs) can be obtained.14,15 While some BIFs exhibit zeolitic topologies, others such 
as BIF40 (chemical composition CuBH(bim)3, bim  benzimidazolate) feature 
coordination units with trigonal connectivity and exhibit reductive properties originating 
from the hydridic hydrogen atom of BH(bim)3.15,16 
In addition to the highly porous crystalline structures of ZIFs, their thermal properties 
have recently attracted significant interest.17 Studies have shown that certain ZIFs, 
specifically those based on Zn2, Co2, and Fe2, can melt when heated to 
temperatures between around 400 C to 600 C under an inert atmosphere.1821 Upon 
cooling, these melts form amorphous glasses that retain some of their 
microporosity,22,23 making them valuable for applications such as gas separation 
membranes24,25 and (quasi)solid electrolytes.26,27 This melting and glassforming 
ability is particularly noteworthy as it allows the materials to be shaped and molded in 
their liquid state, a capability not available in conventional nonmeltable MOFs or 
coordination networks.28,29 This unique property expands the practical applications and 
processing possibilities of ZIFbased materials, offering new opportunities for 
innovation in various fields.
