Description:
Organic bases that offer solubility advantages and improved functional group tolerance.

However, these bases 
present several challenges, such as insolubility in organic solvents, dependence on particle size and stirring speed on reaction 
efficiency, the need for elevated temperatures, and clogging during continuous flow upscaling.32,33 Strong anionic bases suffer 
from moisture sensitivity and limited compatibility with electrophilic functional groups.34 In response to these challenges, 
there has been increasing interest in utilizing organic bases,35 such as guanidines,3639 amidines,36,38,40,41 and phosphazenes.37
39,42,43 Although these bases are more expensive, they offer solubility advantages and, in some cases, improved functional 
group tolerance. Nonetheless, the field remains dependent on the development of specific ligands and the optimization of 
conditions for each reaction.
