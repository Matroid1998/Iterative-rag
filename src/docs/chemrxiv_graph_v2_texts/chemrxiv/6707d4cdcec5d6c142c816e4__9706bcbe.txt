Nanotechnology is an emerging field of research. The distinct physical and chemical
characteristics of nanoparticles, such as their higher aspect ratio and increased surface area
in comparison to bigger particles, have attracted a lot of interest (1). An exciting area of
nanotechnology with positive economic and environmental effects is the emergence of
green chemistry for the efficient synthesis of metalbased nanoparticles using extracts of
various plants (2), as opposed to chemical and physical methods used for nanoparticle
synthesis. Potential options among these metalbased nanoparticles, such zinc oxide (ZnO),
have drawn a lot of attention. The synthesis of ZnO produces a wide range of
nanostructured morphologies, including nanoparticles and nanosheets, as well as more
complicated structures such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanoarrays, nanorings, nanodisks,
nanobelts, and nanorods (3).

Nanoparticles with unique physical and chemical properties, including high aspect ratio, large surface area, and excellent optical and electrical behaviors.

Nanoparticles, such as ZnO NPs, specifically stand out due to
their twostep synthesis process involving nucleation and particle growth (5). Nonetheless,
the specific morphology of ZnO nanostructures is highly dependent on the synthesis
method and reaction conditions, such as temperature, pH, and precursor concentration,
allowing for tailored properties and applications in fields ranging from optoelectronics to
biomedicine. Scientific research has shown great interest in zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO
NPs) due to their unique physical and chemical properties. These include a high aspect
ratio, large surface area, and excellent optical and electrical behaviors (6). One of the most intriguing aspects of ZnO nanostructures is their ability to form a variety of
dimensional configurations, each exhibiting distinct properties and functionalities.
