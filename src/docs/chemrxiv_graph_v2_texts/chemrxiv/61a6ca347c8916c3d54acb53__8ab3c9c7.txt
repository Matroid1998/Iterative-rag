Description:
High value nutritional components found in thraustochytrid oil.

In this way, these 
organisms can be engineered to produce the fatty oil profile of plant oils. Furthermore, 
thraustochytrids can produce high value nutritional oil containing omega3 fatty acids, such as 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) mainly in the form of triglycerides.2 Remarkably, triglycerides 
accumulated in thraustochytrids constitute more than 90 of the lipids,3 which can be used as high 
value nutritional supplements for humans. In addition, low cholesterol content makes thraustochytrid 
oil desirable for supplementing food products.4 Thraustochytrid derivedoil has been designated 
generally recognized as safe status for its use in food products.5 In other applications, 
thraustochytrid oil containing triglycerides has been produced as a precursor for biodiesel production.
