Description:
Forms micelles with better loading efficiency and smaller particle size for nocathiacin I.

Text:
investigated micelles based on methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)bpoly(Llactide) 
micelles (mPEGbPLLA, Lmicelles) and mPEGbpoly(Dlactide) micelles (mPEGbPDLA, Dmicelles) to 
solubilize the glycosylated antibiotic nocathiacin I (containing multiple chiral centres) and other chiral 
compounds (containing D or Lsugars).7 They observed that the nocathiacin I loaded Dmicelles exhibited 
better loading efficiency and smaller particle size than that of Lmicelles. Also, for micelles loaded with 
other chiral compounds, D and Lmicelles showed a marked difference in particle size, even though the 
loading efficiency between D and Lmicelles were not significantly different. Hu et al. loaded insulin in 
stereo multiblock copoly(lactide)s (smbPLAs) with different stereoregularity.8 They found that smbPLAs
