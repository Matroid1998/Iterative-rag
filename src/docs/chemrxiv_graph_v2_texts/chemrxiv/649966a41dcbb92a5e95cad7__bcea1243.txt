Several other oxides have been considered as ptype transparent conductors with varying de
grees of success Lidoped NiO can reach hole concentrations on the order of 1  1021 cm3 and
conductivity up to 11 S cm1, but mobility is less than 0.05 cm2 V1 s1 and transmission drops to
50 upon doping; 14 SnO is a reasonably good ptype TCM, with mobility around 7 cm2 V1 s1 at
11017 cm3 carriers, and can also be doped ntype, but incurs stability issues due to the presence of
Sn(II) (a problem which pervades ternary Sn(II) materials also); 15,16 quasiclosed shell 3 and 6 ma
terials such as Srdoped LaCrO3 and the ZnM2O4 spinels (M  Co, Rh, Ir); 17,18 and Ba2BiTaO6, which
shows excellent mobility (up to 30 cm2 V1 s1) due to strong Bi 62  O 2interaction at the valence
band, but the carrier density is limited to 1  1014 cm3.
