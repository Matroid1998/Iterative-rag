Description:
A functional group that can participate in hydrogen bonding.

Text:
of an NMe group on the second amide 
adjacent to a basic amine to prevent hydrogen bonding increases conformational heterogeneity and results in the appearance 
of novel conformations. The decreased rigidity of the backbone allows sidechainbackbone interactions to influence 
conformation and produces conformations distinct from those previously reported for this class of macrocycles. This offers 
further support for the strong influence backbone Brnsted base can have on overall macrocycle conformation when they can 
interact with other functionality, along with acting as a structural pin on the macrocycle that is predictably conformationally 
sensitive to modification. This is unlike the relatively insignificant effects of Nmethylation of backbone amides in a homodetic 
peptide.
