A clean and renewable source of power with potential for use in energy storage and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Hydrogen energy holds immense potential as a clean and renewable source of power, offering a 
promising solution to the growing global energy demands and environmental concerns.1 However, 
current storage and operation technologies such as high pressure hydrogen tanks for use in 
hydrogenpowered vehicles and stationary backup power applications are economically too 
expensive to replace existing technologies.2 To overcome these limitations and ensure the 
widespread adoption of hydrogen as a clean energy source, the development of lowcost and high
performance storage systems is crucial. Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), composed of metal ions and organic linkers, represent 
a promising class of materials for hydrogen storage due to their tunable properties, such as high 
surface area, relevant pore size and geometry, and chemical functionalities.
