Description:
A small molecule involved in reactions where kinetics cannot always be represented by simple rate determining steps.

Third, the high 
computational cost of building datasets involving such larger reaction intermediates 
like cyclic hydrocarbons precludes the use of dataheavy approaches like deep 
learning20. Fourth, the reaction kinetics cannot always be represented by one or two 
rate determining steps as is done for reactions involving small molecules like N2 and 
O2. Instead, reaction kinetics can only be calculated after knowing the energetics of all 
reaction intermediates. To overcome these four challenges, a new machine learning 
paradigm is required that employs minimalistic training datasets, is transferable across 
different active site motifs in structurally and chemically complex systems and is 
efficient to deploy across large cyclic hydrocarbons.
