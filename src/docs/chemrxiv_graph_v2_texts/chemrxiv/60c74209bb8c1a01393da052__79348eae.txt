Caesium 
phosphomolybdate (Cs3PMo12O40, CsMP, x  3) can be prepared 
synthetically and has been studied,32 although in ion exchange 
environments, only about two thirds of the NH4 ions in AMP (x  2) 
are typically replaced with Cs,17,33 though the theoretical capacity of 
AMP is 220 mgg Cs (x  3). (NH4)3PMo12O40(s)  xCs(aq)  (NH4)3xCsxPMo12O40(s)  xNH4(aq) (1)
