Description:
A compound being substituted by 2,5furandicarboxylic acid due to similar chemical structures.

Nowadays, cumulative environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change are 
leading to the development of new ideas and solutions which need to be implemented to reduce the 
undesirable effects caused by the processing of fossil resources.1,2 Therefore, the use of biomass as a 
raw material for the production of chemicals has been a focus for many years as concerns over the 
sustainability of chemical manufacturing have become increasingly important.31213,14 One particular 
area of research focus involves the substitution of terephthalic acid (TPA) with 2,5furandicarboxylic 
acid (FDCA) due to their similar chemical structures. FDCA presents a compelling alternative as it 
can be obtained entirely from renewable resources through the oxidative conversion of 5
hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is derived from the acidic dehydrogenation of hexoses (Fig. 1).
