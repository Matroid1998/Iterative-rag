Description:
Used in carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics for lightweight aircraft structures.

In order to reduce the carbon footprint for the benefit of the global economy, environment and social wellbeing, 
utilization of more sustainable materials and enhancing materials manufacturing efficiency become ever 
important for the modern aerospace industry 1,2. In recent years, carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics 
(CFRTPs), particularly carbon fibre reinforced polyetherketoneketone (CFPEKK), have been increasingly used 
in new generation lightweight aircraft structures 24. Compared to conventional thermoset carbon fibre 
reinforced plastics (e.g. CFepoxy) 5, CFPEKK offers excellent mechanical performance and better 
interlaminar  intralaminar fracture toughness 6,7 and the thermoplastic nature of the PEKK matrix also opens 
a new avenue towards aircraft selfrepair 8 and recycling 9, making it a promising candidate for more 
sustainable aircraft structures.
