In recent time, these twodimensional (2D) materials have fascinated noteworthy attention
because of their distinctive properties and potential functionalities in various fields, including
electronics, photonics, and energy storage 14. Among these 2D materials, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have appeared as favorable candidates due to their tunable bandgaps,
excellent mechanical properties, and high carrier mobility. TMDs consist of a layered structure
where transition metal atoms are sandwiched between chalcogen atoms. This layered
arrangement gives rise to weak van der Waals (vdW) forces between adjacent layers, making
vdW interactions crucial for accurately describing their structural, electronic, and optical
properties 510. In case of simulation, density functional theory (DFT) has become the method of choice for
investigating the properties of TMDs due to its computational efficiency and reasonable
accuracy.
