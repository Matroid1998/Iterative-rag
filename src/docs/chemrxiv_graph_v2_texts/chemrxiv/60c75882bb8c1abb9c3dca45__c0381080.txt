Description:
A lead compound with nanomolar activities used as a pharmacological tool.

Text:
Based on the identified caffeine (8, 
Figure 1) as a lead compound, our structureactivity relationship study succeeded in tuning the 
potency of this chemotype to nanomolar activities sufficient for the use as a pharmacological tool. Additionally, the structurally related and recently approved antiParkinson drug istradefylline 
emerged as a potent TLX modulator with low nanomolar potency. Mutagenesis studies defined a 
molecular epitope of TLX modulation by this class of TLX ligands to a region inside the ligand 
binding domain (LBD) involving interaction with helix 5. We observed also heterodimerization of 
TLX with retinoid X receptor (RXR) as well as recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor 2 
(SMRT). We demonstrated that istradefylline robustly displaced this repressor from TLX and 
modulated dimerization aligning with its effects on cellular TLX activity.
