Description:
A nucleophilic compound that reacts with electrophiles and undergoes oxidation.

Text:
18 Herein, the nucleophilic 1,4dihydropyridine (1,4
DHP) formed reacts with electrophiles (imines, enol esters, SCF3, 
SCF2H, CN reagents) and undergoes subsequent oxidation to 
afford C3functionalized pyridines.19,20,21,22,23 In 2022, Studer and 
coworkers developed an efficient C3 functionalizations of 
pyridines involving a benchstable electronrich oxazinopyridine 
generated from dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, methyl pyruvate 
and a pyridine.24,25 This intermediate, as dienamine, reacts with 
electrophilic reagents or radials leading to, after rearomatization, 
C3 functionalized pyridines.
