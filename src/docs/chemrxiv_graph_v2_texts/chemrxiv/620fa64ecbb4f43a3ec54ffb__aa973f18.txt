Description:
The most widely used photoswitch from materials sciences to chemical biology.

Text:
Photoswitchable small molecules are powerful tools for highprecision manipulations of a range of biological 
processes in live animals (in vivo) or in live cells.1,2 They may even be irreplaceable as tools to properly 
address systems in which spatiotemporal patterning of biological activity on the subcellularcellular or tissue 
level is crucial e.g. microtubule and actin dynamics in cytoskeletonsupported motion (subcellularcellular 
level)3,4, or firing of retinal neurons for vision restoration (tissue level)5,6. Hartley first characterised azobenzene as an EZ photoswitch in 19377. After Erlangers pioneering 
applications in protein and neuron control,8,9 azobenzenes became the most widelyused photoswitch from 
materials sciences10 to chemical biology.2,11 Recently though, a range of other photoswitches with distinct 
features are emerging, for better photocontrol of specific biological systems12,13.

Description:
Photoswitches that do not provide efficient 405 nm excitation, no photoresponse to imaging lines, self-reporting fluorescence, good solubility, and relaxation on biologically relevant timescales.

Text:
Often, these are 
differentiated in their kinetics of relaxation to the thermodynamically more stable isomer,14 and on shifting 
their photoisomerisation action spectra either to the nearUV, to avoid photoresponse during imaging while 
permitting photoactivation with the common 405 nm laser;15 to the midvisible, for efficient patterning with 
imaging laser lines;16 or towards the red, for photoresponse to light that penetrates more deeply through 
complex environments such as tissues.17 
Here, we desired to explore scaffolds that are asyet untested for cellular photopharmacology, but which offer 
a desirable balance of properties that neither azobenzenes nor other photoswitches such as heterostilbenes 
provide chiefly, efficient 405 nm excitation, no photoresponse to imaging lines, selfreporting fluorescence, 
good solubility, and relaxation on biologically relevant timescales.
