to Carbon Dioxide Capture 
The climate change crisis requires largescale human behaviour changes and the rapid deployment of 
a range of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation technologies. Among these, carbon dioxide capture 
and storage is an important technology that can reduce emissions from point sources.1 In this approach, 
CO2 is captured from gas emissions at industrial sources that may include power stations, hydrogen 
production plants, cement factories and steel factories. This is achieved using a capture material that 
selectively absorbs CO2 from the mixture of emitted gases (Figure 1). The CO2 is then collected from 
the capture material via the application of heat (andor a vacuum) and is subsequently stored in the 
ground where it can be permanently sequestered.
