Description:
A neutral hydrophilic polymer known for its protein-resistant layers and ability to enable end-functional groups for tethering receptors to surfaces.

Neutral 
hydrophilic polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been widely investigated in 
literature and they show particularly interesting properties in terms of proteinresistant 
layers,14,15 while also enabling endfunctional groups that can be used to tether receptors to 
the sensor surface.16 Studies have also shown that the antifouling capabilities are strongly 
dependent upon polymer conformation17,18 and chain length.19 Unlike in case of rigid 
molecules, the PEG monolayers have shown to result in different conformations, mushroom or 
brush owing to the flexibility that can be attributed to the polymeric backbone. In particular, 
mushroomlike conformation was attributed to low polymer chain density with limited 
possibilities of lateral interaction.
