Description:
An industrial byproduct that is cheap and abundant, used in inverse vulcanization to create sulfur-containing polymers.

Text:
Inverse vulcanization, coined by Jeffery Pyun et al.,1 is a 
method of combining inorganic sulfur and organic 
monomers into a new type of sulfurcontaining polymer.2, 3 
Sulfur, as an industrial byproduct, is cheap and abundant.4, 
5 Inverse vulcanization makes it possible to transform this 
waste raw material into useful polymeric materials. The 
material obtained through this method is a kind of polymer 
network, based on sulfur chains crosslinked through 
organic comonomers, which shows unique and interesting 
properties which most traditional polymers lack such as 
high refractive index6 and intrinsic dynamic function7.
