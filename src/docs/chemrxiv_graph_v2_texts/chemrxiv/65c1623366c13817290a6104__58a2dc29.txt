Description:
Preformed crosslinks used in synthetic polymer networks.

peptides,

can
form
networks
in
response to temperature, light, and solvents by partially
unfolding, thus exposing previously buried, or cryptic,
binding sites. Of particular interest to us, these cryptic
binding sites can also be revealed in response to a
mechanical
stimulus4,5. For
example,
bronectin
will
dynamically unfold and polymerize into brils in response
to cellgenerated forces68. In contrast, synthetic polymers
commonly weaken or even rupture under force9. Inspired by the unfolding triggered crosslinking of proteins
like bronectin, we sought to develop a new method of
installing
mechanosensitivity
within
synthetic
polymer
networks. Recently,
we
developed
organogels10
and
hydrogels11 with mechanoresponsive properties, both
based on preformed diacrylate crosslinks with reactive
pendent thiols for postpolymerization crosslinking.
