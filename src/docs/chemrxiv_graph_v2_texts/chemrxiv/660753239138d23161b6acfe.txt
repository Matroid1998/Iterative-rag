Description:
A candidate for potential applications in hydrogen production.

Text:
The advent of highperformance computing, robotics, and artificial 
intelligence (AI) has heralded digitalization as pivotal accelerators in the development of clean 
energy technologies, aligning with the Industry 4.0 paradigm of integrating data science tools 
across research, development (RD) and manufacturing.3 Over the past few years, datadriven 
approaches have emerged as a powerful tool to reduce the labtomarket time for new materials, 
as demonstrated from virtual molecular screening to autonomous synthesis of inorganic 
materials.46 These advances in accelerated materials discovery have led to a substantial 
increase in candidates poised for potential applications in batteries, hydrogen production, and 
solar cells. Consequently, theres a need to speed up the development and testing of new devices 
for both providing timely feedback to materials RD and for pushing new technologies to 
deployment.
