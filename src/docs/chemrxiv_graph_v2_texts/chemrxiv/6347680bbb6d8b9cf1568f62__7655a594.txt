Description:
A compound synthesized through multicomponent assembly approaches.

Text:
Contemporary advances in catalysis have unlocked new approaches for multicomponent 
arylethylamine assembly.813 Despite sustained efforts in developing arylethylamine syntheses from 
alkenes, most methods require either conjugated activating groups,1417 directing groups,1820 
intramolecular substrate designs,2126 or introduction of the nitrogen atom in a higher oxidation state.27 
Therefore, a general alkene aminoarylation strategy remains an unmet need.
