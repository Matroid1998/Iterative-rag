Description:
In a low-coordinate environment, it is more similar to carbon than to nitrogen due to its isolobal nature and similar electronegativity.

The study of phosphoruscontaining 
analogues of nitrogencontaining moieties has grown 
in recent years, with examples including phosphorus 
analogues of pyridine and urea (Figure 1), as well as 
imines, nitriles, and the cyanate and cyanide 
anions.1 When phosphorus is in a lowcoordinate 
environment, it has been shown that it is more 
similar to carbon than to nitrogen, principally due to 
the isolobal nature of P and C and their similar 
electronegativities, resulting in phosphorus being 
dubbed the carbon copy.2 For tricoordinate 
phosphorus, the presence of the lone pair means 
that there are obvious parallels with analogous 
nitrogen compounds, although there is a significantly 
reduced propensity for delocalisation of this lone pair 
in 
the 
former.
