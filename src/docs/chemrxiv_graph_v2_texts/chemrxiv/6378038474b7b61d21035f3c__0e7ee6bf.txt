Description:
Has the highest degenerate orbitals that split into (6b2) and (2a2) orbitals.

In particular, the Br atom increases the transition 
energy of the carbon atom bonded to the bromine atom, here 
labeled as C. The two highest occupied molecular orbitals, (6b2) 
and (2a2), result from a splitting of the highest degenerate  
orbitals of Bz. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) 
(6b2), with the lowest binding energy of 8.992 eV,11 shows partial 
bromine character.12,13,14 The major electron density of the (6b2) 
orbital is distributed among several atoms, the C atom (0.46), the 
C atom that is in the para position to C (0.5), the Br atom (0.47) 
and among the other C atoms (0.56).12 The next lower (2a2), 
orbital of BrBz is noticeably shifted to lower energy (i.e., to higher 
binding energy, 9.663 eV) compared to the parent  orbital of Bz.
