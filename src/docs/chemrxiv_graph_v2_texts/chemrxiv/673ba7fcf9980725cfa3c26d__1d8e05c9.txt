Description:
A type of fullerene with solubilities in different solvents used to estimate partitioning between solvents.

Text:
In the case of C60 fullerene, solubilities in different solvents are 
available, and these can be used to estimate the partitioning between solvents and 
therefore to develop a coarsegrained model compatible with the Martini framework. However, in version 2 of the force field, no available particle type could reproduce 
fullerene partitioning in a satisfactory way, and we resorted to the use of an optimized
