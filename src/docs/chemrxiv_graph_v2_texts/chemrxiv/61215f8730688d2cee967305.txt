Description:
Forms vacancies in ZnO that can have neutral or +2 charge states depending on the electron reservoir.

A
famous example of this is the oxygen vacancy (VO) in ZnO, where
computational studies310 and EPR experiments11 have asserted
that the charge state is neutral (i.e., V0
O) when EF is near the
conduction band minimum, and the charge state is 2 (i.e. V2
O )
when EF is near the valence band maximum. The charge state(s) of a point defect can be understood from
the exchanging of electrons between the defective region and an
electron reservoir.2,12 For a hypothetical IIVI compound AB as
illustrated in Figure 1, the creation of a B vacancy (VB) for exam
ple leaves 2 electrons remaining, since B has 6 valence electrons.
