It is well known, that sulfur ylides14 react with carbonyl groups or with electron deficient 
carboncarbon double bond in a twostep reaction to afford epoxide or cyclopropanes, 
respectively.15 Sulfur ylide in situ generated by treatment of ethyl dimethyl sulfonium 
acetate bromide with DBU, were reacted with ab cyclic enones,16,17 chiral enones18 and 
with Nenoyl oxazolidinones in presence of Lewis acids19 are reported in the literature. However, the use of chiral auxiliary unsaturated ester or amide with stabilised sulfur 
ylide is limited. So far few methods has been reported, such as using pyroglutamic acid 
(O,Nacetal and NBocpyrrolinone) as a chiral auxiliary  unsaturated amide with 
stabilized sulfur ylide.12,20 However the Diastereoselectivity is very poor. Still there are 
demands for better Diastereoselectivity methods.
