Description:
Used in alternating ring opening copolymerisation to produce polycarbonates.

Controlled ways to make degradable and 
chemically complex materials from mixtures of 
building blocks are increasingly required in order 
to tailor their properties to ever more demanding 
technological 
requirements.18 
One 
popular 
methodology to achieve this is the alternating ring
opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of a strained 
heterocycle with a heteroallene (yielding e.g. polycarbonates from CO2 and epoxides) or a 
second heterocycle (yielding e.g. polyesters from 
cyclic anhydrides and epoxides).916 Sustainable 
catalysts featuring maingroup metals are enjoying 
increasing popularity, but the associated reaction 
pathways are only partially understood and it is 
often unclear which mono or multimetallic, 
cooperative or uncooperative and neutral or 
zwitterionic routes occur. 1725 Polymerising more 
complex ROCOP monomer mixtures with such 
catalysts can achieve the selective onepot 
construction of higher order polymer architectures.
