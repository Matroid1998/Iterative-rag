Description:
A well-known heterocycle with synthesis methods that include photochemical events using visible light.

Text:
Since the first groundbreaking work in 
2009 14, we found only 56 papers where benzothiazole motif was directly formed through 
photochemical event using visible light and in most cases at room temperature (Fig. 1). Thus, we 
believe this narrow area deserves separate consideration as a presented comprehensive review. Since benzothiazoles are one of the bestknown heterocycles, there are dozens of reviews 
devoted to their synthesis, including the most recent 1526. Despite this, photochemical methods 
for their synthesis are relatively rare and are not systematically presented in these and similar 
reviews. Thus, this comprehensive review highlights the 15years progress in the synthesis of 
benzothiazoles mediated by visible light providing overview of their synthetic scope. This work is
