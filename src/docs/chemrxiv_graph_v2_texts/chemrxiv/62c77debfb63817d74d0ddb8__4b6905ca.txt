Abstract 
H2 is a widely used reductive reagent in organic synthesis. The direct reactions between dihydrogen and 
other organic compounds are very difficult, due to the high stability of H2 molecules. To solve this 
problem, some strategies for dihydrogen activation have been developed. In this review, we are going 
to introduce the dihydrogen activation using metals and alloys, metal complexes, divalent main group 
compounds and frustrated Lewis pairs by introducing the mechanisms, advantages and limitations.
