Description:
A fuel-related product that can be derived from carbon dioxide.

The environmental consequences are basis for 
political initiatives on a global scale, which are driven by the aim of reducing the emission of greenhouse 
gases, most notably carbon dioxide.1 Technologies exist that are able to trap the CO2 from the flue gas 
of major emitters, however, the price of carbon dioxide is too low to be a motivation for industrials to 
increase their efforts in recovering the greenhouse gas.2 The utilization of CO2 as a C1 feedstock for the 
generation of industrially relevant chemicals is certainly an interesting different approach.3 CO2 is an 
attractive renewable C1 source, which can lead to fuelrelated products such as methane, methanol, and 
formic acid.4 Those approaches would not only reduce the carbon dioxide emission through carbon 
capture, the costs of the sequestration could also be compensated by the production of chemicals which 
are in global demand.5 Most of the liquid fuels used are based on fossil fuels, which again generate new 
CO2 in the atmosphere.

Description:
Produced from a precursor under ambient conditions.

Text:
The first report on 
transition metalfree CO2 capture from air, including the consecutive reduction of the CO2 to produce a 
methanol precursor, which can be easily converted into methanol under ambient conditions, was made 
by the group of Mandal in 2019.20 They reported an imidazolebased mesoionic carbene (Figure 1) 
supported 9BBN adduct, which is able to perform the described conversion, including a thorough 
investigation of the mechanistic pathway.
