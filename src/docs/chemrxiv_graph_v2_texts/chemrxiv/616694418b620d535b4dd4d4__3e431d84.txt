Description:
Used in the field of semi(transfer)hydrogenation of alkynes with high selectivity towards E-alkenes.

Text:
As manganese is concerned, the use of pincertype ligands and bifunctional catalysis21 is crucial in the field of semi
(transfer)hydrogenation of alkynes (Scheme 1, MnI  MnV). However, high selectivity towards Ealkenes and the 
conversion of alkylalkyl substituted alkynes or terminal alkynes with high functional group tolerance remains
