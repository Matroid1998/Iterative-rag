Description:
Possesses a unique version of an ironsulfur cluster featuring a diiron centre and a bridging dithiolate.

Their possible role in enabling the emergence 
of early life1 and capacity to perform many different roles within enzymatic pathways2,3 has led to 
them being characterised as one of the most ubiquitous and functionally versatile prosthetic groups 
in nature.4 The discovery and purification of ferredoxins in 1962 was an early indication that iron 
could play roles in enzymes in addition to its wellknown presence in hemoproteins.5 Both iron and 
ironsulfur clusters act primarily as mediators for electron transfer with the ability to be either the 
source or sink for electrons in redox reactions, and ironsulfur clusters are extremely useful for 
electron transport due to the delocalisation of electron density across the cluster.6,7 The mediator role 
is one of the most common functions of ironsulfur clusters, found in a variety of enzymes including 
those that couple proton transfer to electron transport, such as FeFe hydrogenases, which possess a 
unique version of an ironsulfur cluster featuring a diiron centre and a bridging dithiolate.8,9 Many 
enzymes containing ironsulfur clusters use 2Fe2S, 4Fe4S and 3Fe4S structures in both redox 
and nonredox functions.
