This feature of these molecules not only regulates their biological activi
ties,21,22 but also provides them with potential for applications in spinbased technologies.310
Over the years, a large amount of effort has been dedicated to understand the spinstate en
ergetics of metalloporphyrins with nearly degenerate spin multiplets.2354 These molecules have
been investigated in several works, applying different genres of theoretical methodologies such
as HartreeFock (HF),3133 numerous density functional theory based methods,4659 and multi
reference based methods accounting for static and dynamical correlations, etc.3446 Each of the
studies has unveiled a difficulty level of the addressed questions and paved the way for their
