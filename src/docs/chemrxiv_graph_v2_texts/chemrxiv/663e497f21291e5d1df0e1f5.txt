Description:
Used as a molecular tag in various messenger-tagging methods.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the important physicochemical methods in the chemists arsenal.1 This spec
troscopic technique observes intra and intermolecular vibrational motions, as their resonant excitation energies lie
in the IR region, i.e., approximately from 100 to 104 cm1 (wavelengths from 0.1 mm to 780 nm).1, 2 In addition
to simple absorptionemission IR spectroscopy,3 there are other techniques, such as vibrational circular dichroism
(VCD), which is sensitive to molecular chirality,4, 5 vibrational Raman spectroscopy,6 inelastic neutron scatter
ing (INS),68 infraredultraviolet (IRUV) ion dip spectroscopy,9 infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD)
spectroscopy,1014 various messengertagging methods (such as helium, nitrogen, or hydrogen molecular tag),1520
that allow measuring spectra of ions, and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, that allows
to probe molecular motions at the phase interfaces.21, 22 All these vibrational spectroscopy methods allow us to
inspect the properties of molecules, ions, and molecular aggregates in the gas, liquid, and solid phases and at the
interfaces between phases.
