Description:
An open octahedron structure expected from the assembly of certain ligands.

Text:
The question is whether the assembled 
structures can be controlled by other changes in multitopic ligands 
while retaining the original coordination directions. Let us consider the 
selfassembly of Pd2 and tritopic ligand 2 (Figure 1b), whose structure 
is basically the same as 1 except for the dihedral angle () between 
the 4pyridyl rings and the central ring ( for 1 is 0, while  for 2 is 
larger than 0). Because the coordination directions in 2 are the same 
as those in 1, the assembly of the M6L4 open octahedron was 
expected from 2. Herein, we report that the dihedral angle change in tritopic ligands 
with three 4pyridyl rings attached to a central aromatic ring afforded 
different selfassemblies of M3nL2n (n  3 and 4).
