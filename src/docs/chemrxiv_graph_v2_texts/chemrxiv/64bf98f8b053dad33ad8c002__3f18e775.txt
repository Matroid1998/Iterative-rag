Description:
Elements used in phototriggered complexes to activate carbon-hydrogen bonds.

Text:
Carbonhydrogen (CH) bonds are among the strongest chemical linkages in nature and thus inherently 
unreactive. Still, manipulating carbonhydrogen bonds holds the key to numerous molecular 
transformations that are essential in organic and metalorganic synthesis within the context of green 
chemistry, the design of new pharmaceuticals or the transformation of low molecular weight 
hydrocarbons to high energy density liquid fuels (1). However, since CH bonds lack considerable 
polarity, their manipulation via activation and functionalization is challenging due to significant energy 
barriers needed to be overcome under ambient conditions. One way of activating CH bonds is using 
phototriggered transition metal complexes (2, 3).

Description:
Involved in photochemical CH activation by forming a low-valent reactive metal center.

Text:
Photochemical CH activation with transition metal 
complexes, involves the dissociation of one or several ligands from the photoexcited transition metal 
complex in a roomtemperature solution to generate a lowvalent reactive metal center that then 
facilitates CH bond cleavage in alkanes from solution. The most common metal complexes effectuating 
photoinitiated CH activation are second or third row transition metal carbonyls and dihydrides, where 
the loss of a carbonyl or dihydride ligand creates a reactive metal center. The open coordination site at 
the metal then enables the binding of an alkane to form a socalled alkane complex followed by 
subsequent CH bond cleavage in an oxidative addition step by insertion of the metal into the CH bond.
