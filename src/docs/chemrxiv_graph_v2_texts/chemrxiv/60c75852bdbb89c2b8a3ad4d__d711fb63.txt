The equilibrium shifts towards NO with increasing
temperature, a fact exploited in the BirkelandEyde (BE) process for thermally xing N2
at high temperatures achieved within a thermal plasma.6 At these high temperatures, N2
and O2 are partially atomized, and NO is produced by O and N radical reactions with N2
and O2, respectively, in the socalled Zeldovich mechanism.7 Similar processes are at play
in conventional combustion of fuel in air, motivating interest in NO decomposition catalysts
for environmental protection.8 However, catalytic N2 oxidation under thermal conditions is
unknown. Nonthermal N2O2 plasmas are known and have been observed to generate NO at bulk
temperatures much below those necessary for thermal N2 oxidation. NO yields can even
exceed those expected based on the bulk thermodynamic equilibrium.9 These NTPs contain
