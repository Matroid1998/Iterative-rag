Description:
At ambient conditions, ZnO has a hexagonal wurtzite structure and transforms into a cubic rocksalt structure at pressures above 6 GPa.

At ambient conditions ZnO has hexagonal wurtzite (w) structure (space group P63mc) which 
transforms into cubic rocksalt (rs) structure (space group Fm3m) at pressures above 6 GPa 1. 
rsZnO and ZnObased cubic solid solutions with different ions seem to be promising for 
optoelectronic and spintronics applications due to ability to incorporate much higher dopants 
concentrations as compared with the wurtzite phase. The octahedral oxygen environment in rock
salt ZnO removes the crystallochemical limitations for the introduction of a variety of cations. Hence, the properties of the solid solution can be tuned over a wide range of dopant concentrations 
while remaining within the field of its phase stability.

Description:
A material with semiconducting properties that undergoes a high-pressure phase transition from wurtzite to cubic form.

Text:
Examples of materials interesting from the 
point of view of their semiconducting properties are ZnO solid solutions with magnesium oxide 
2,3 and nickel oxide 4,5. The research is developing in two directions epitaxial stabilization of 
rsZnO in thin films on oriented substrates 25 and highpressure phase transition of wurtzite ZnO 
into cubic one 616. At ambient pressure the solubility of Ni2 in wZnO is extremely low, being 0.9 mol at 1100 K. 
The solubility of Zn2 in rsNiO is much higher, namely, 29 mol at 1100 K 17 or 35 mol at 
1500 K 18. At 1100 K, the solubility of Co2 in wZnO is 6.5 mol while Zn2 solubility in 
rsCoO is three times higher, reaching 22 mol 17.
