Text:
7,7Diazaisoindigo is a conjugated compound with a distinctive molecular structure 
and intriguing chemical properties. The two azaisoindigo subunits are linked through a 
C7C7 bond whose dihedral angle has a great impact on the electronic and optical 
characteristics of the molecule. The semiconducting applications of 7,7diazaisoindigo 
and their derivatives have been thoroughly studied 13. This molecule has also been 
used as building block for the synthesis of polymers with semiconductor properties 4
7. These polymers have been incorporated to diverse electronic devices as fieldeffect 
transistors 4,7. In contrast, the photophysical properties of 7,7diazaisoindigos have 
been scarcely investigated probably due to its weak fluorescence emission. The weak 
fluorescence observed in 7,7diazaisoindigos has been attributed to the rotation around 
the C7C7 bond upon excitation 810.
