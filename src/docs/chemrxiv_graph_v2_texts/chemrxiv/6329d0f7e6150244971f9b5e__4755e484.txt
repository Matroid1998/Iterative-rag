Description:
Identified as the active sites for the NO3R reaction.

Text:
Remarkably, Cu3Al2OF10 is highly active for the 8electron NO3R, attaining upwards of 57 Faradaic 
Efficiency (FE) and 1220 A.g1 mass activity. As such, this is the first oxyfluoride material applied towards 
NO3R. A complementary set of electroanalytical and operando spectroscopic investigations were carried 
out to elucidate that the Cu sites are indeed the active sites for the reaction and that the rate limiting step is
