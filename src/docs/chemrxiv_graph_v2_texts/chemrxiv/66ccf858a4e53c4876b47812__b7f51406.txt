Description:
A metal with high conductivity, used in direct printing onto various substrates.

Text:
Processes like direct ink writing (DIW) 8, 
electrohydrodynamic printing (EHD) and inkjet printing 9, liquid metal printing 10, 11 , laser
induced forward transfer (LIFT) and electrochemical printing 12, 13 offer a degree of flexibility 
and costeffectiveness that is not readily achievable through conventional means. Among these methods, confined electrodeposition (CED) has demonstrated exceptional 
control over the microstructure of printed metal 1417, facilitating the direct printing of high
conductivity ( 2times of the bulk conductivity) metals such as copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) onto 
various substrates 1823. It is also possible to print alloys using this technique by co
electrodeposition from a single electrolyte 24. Electroless plating can be combined with 
electroplating or direct ink writing for development of hybrid printing technologies 25, 26.
