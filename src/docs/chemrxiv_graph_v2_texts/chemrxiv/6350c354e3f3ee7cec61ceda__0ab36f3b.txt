Description:
Involved in oxidative etching of carbon nanoparticles.

Text:
For example, in experiments using single NP 
mass spectrometry to study kinetics for individual carbon NPs in the 1200 to 2100 K range, we 
found that both sublimation1 and O2 oxidative etching23 kinetics varied substantially for NPs from 
different feedstocks (graphitic, graphene oxide, carbon black, diamond, nanoonion), but that even 
for NPs from the same feedstock, the initial rates varied by up to an order of magnitude. More 
surprisingly, the etching rates varied over time, with rates oscillating by orders of magnitude. All 
types of carbon NPs were found to evolve to become essentially inert to O2 etching, but the time 
required for this evolution varied strongly for different carbon materials and for different NPs.

Description:
Catalyzes isomerization to form fully-coordinated, fullerene-like surface layers.

Text:
The initial NPtoNP variations were attributed to variations in the number of undercoordinated 
reactive sites present on each NP surface, and the evolution over time to evolution of the NP 
surface under reaction conditions. The eventual transition to nearcomplete O2 inertness implies 
that the NPs evolved to have almost no undercoordinated surface sites, which was attributed to 
O2catalyzed isomerization to form fullycoordinated, fullerenelike surface layers. The ability to 
monitor structural evolution for individual NPs over time under reaction conditions is one of the 
strengths of the single NP mass spectrometry method. Here we apply this approach to Si NP 
oxidative etching.
