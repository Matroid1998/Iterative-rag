Description:
Used in alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production under alkaline conditions.

Text:
Green hydrogen will be essential as a fuel of a defossilized energy economy 1. Compared with conventional fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil, hydrogen
has the highest specic energy 2, and if used in fuel cells it constitutes a clean,
ecient and sustainable technology 3. 5
An already welldeveloped and costeective green technology for hydrogen pro
duction is alkaline water electrolysis, in which hydrogen gas is produced from
the water splitting reaction under alkaline conditions 4. In alkaline electrolyz
ers the anode and the cathode are immersed in highly concentrated alkaline
solutions (e.g., NaOH or KOH).
