Description:
A multi-walled porous material used in flexible resistive pressure sensors.

Text:
Highly sensitive flexible pressure sensors can be 
obtained by constructing flexible porous materials that are sensitive to pressure changes, 
and their pressure detection range can be enhanced by adjusting their porous 
structures.2e The resistive pressure sensor based on a flexible graphenepolyurethane 
(PU) porous sponge with a fracture microstructure was capable of detecting pressures 
from 9 Pa to 10 kPa.8 The reported flexible resistive pressure sensor based on a multi
walled carbon nanotubepolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) porous material was capable of
