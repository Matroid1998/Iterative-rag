Description:
A 0D compound with debated photoluminescent emission properties.

Text:
For instance, the band gap value of the 3D CsPbBr3 
is about 2.35 eV, and that of 0D C4PbBr6 is 3.90 eV.5 Also, while the 3D CsPbBr3 possesses a 
bright green photoluminescent (PL) emission ( 527 nm), the PL emission from the 0D Cs4PbBr6 
is debatable. Some studies state that the green emission from the 0D C4PbBr6 is an inherent 
property of the materials, whereas others attribute this emission to the contamination by the 3D 
CsPbBr3 phase and structural defects.58 Since the halide perovskitenanocrystals (HPNCs) 
have highly active sites, it is favorable for carrying out photocatalytic reactions.
