Description:
A compound whose derivatives undergo rate-determining steps due to loss of aromaticity.

Text:
For benzene derivatives, this step is generally ratedetermining due 
to the loss of aromaticity, which is restored upon subsequent extrusion of the leaving group.1,9 
Although the addition of nucleophiles is kinetically more facile in positions occupied by 
hydrogen to give a Hadduct (Fig. 1b), the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of hydrogen 
(SNArH) is prohibited by unfavorable elimination of a hydride anion.1,2 Nevertheless, formal 
SNArH reactions have been realized in a twostep procedure involving a separate oxidation of
