Description:
A compound used in gram-scale reactions with high yield and enantiomeric ratio.

To further demonstrate the synthetic potential of our protocol, a 
gramscale reaction of 2chloronaphthalene (1a) and benzylic zinc 
reagent (2a) was conducted, and the desired product was obtained 
in 88 isolated yield and 95.54.5 e.r. with only 0.5 catalyst load
ing (Figure 2A), highlighting the scalability and practicality of this 
protocol. Subsequently, the benzylic zinc reagent (2a) was de
creased to 1.2 equiv, and the coupled product 3a was still obtained 
in nearly quantitative yield with 955 e.r. (Figure 2B), which pro
vides strong evidence that the reaction takes place through a dy
namic kinetic process, rather than a simple kinetic resolution.
