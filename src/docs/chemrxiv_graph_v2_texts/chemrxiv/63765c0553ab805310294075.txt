Description:
The configuration of the central carbon affects geminal J-couplings in NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
Experimental spinspin coupling constants (Jcouplings) measured by NMR spectroscopy 
are widely used to determine the structural properties of saccharides in solution.13 JCouplings 
are sensitive to valence bond angles, bond torsion angles, and bond lengths within and adjacent 
to the coupling pathway. Vicinal (threebond) Jcouplings (3Jab) depend strongly on the torsion 
angle between the two coupled nuclei, and experimental values can be interpreted quantitatively 
via Karplus or Karpluslike relationships, revealing conformational preferences in solution.410 
Geminal Jcouplings (2Jab) are used in structure determinations less frequently, and are affected 
by the configurations of the terminal coupled carbons and by the configuration of the central 
carbon.

Description:
Central to the rotameric properties of the CO bond.

Text:
In the latter regard, 2JCCC values depend strongly on the rotameric properties of the C
O bond involving the central carbon, and less so on the rotameric properties of the CO bonds 
involving the coupled carbons.1113 Direct (onebond) Jcouplings (1Jab) have a strong 
dependence on bond length, with larger values corresponding to shorter bond lengths (greater s
character).1,1416 Despite suggestions that 1J values could serve as valuable structural 
constraints in saccharides,1718 detailed conformational interpretations of them have proven 
challenging.1924 
Experimental determinations of saccharide conformation often rely on computational 
methods such as density functional theory (DFT) or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.2529 
Current approaches combine experimental parameters with appropriately restrained calculations 
to derive a model that best matches the experimental data.2934 While this approach has proven 
valuable, it is not without limitations stemming from limited experimental validations of the 
computational methods.
