Description:
The most common nitrogen precursor in chemical vapor deposition.

The growth of InN is problematic due to its low thermal stability; InN decomposes to In 
metal and nitrogen gas at about 550 C.8 This has also been manifested by its high equilibrium 
pressure with nitrogen, which has led to attempts at depositing InN at very high nitrogen 
pressures.9,10,11 Due to slow decomposition kinetics of ammonia (NH3),12 the most common 
nitrogen precursor in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), NIn ratios in the order of 104 has 
often been used in CVD of InN.13 Alternative N precursors, such as dimethylhydrazine and 
tertiarybuthylhydrazine, has been shown ineffective for the growth of InN.14 To allow more 
reactive N species, plasmaassisted approach has been adapted in various growth techniques, 
such as molecule beam epitaxy,15,16,17 sputtering18 and metalorganic CVD19 for the growth of 
InN.
