Description:
Sold as the sodium salt form of naproxen to increase absorption rate.

Text:
Naproxen is a propionic acid derivative that is commonly used overthecounter (OTC) to treat inflammation and pain. NSAIDs such as naproxen are nonselective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase1 (COX1) and cyclooxygenase2 (COX2)
enzymes. These enzymes produce the prostaglandins responsible for pain, inflammation, and fever5. Naproxen is
characterized by its poor water solubility, and is sold commercially as the sodium salt form in order to increase the
absorption rate. In recent times, polymeric conjugated drugs have emerged to improve the bioavailability of drugs while
reducing adverse effects. Standard polymeric prodrugs are created using a polymer carrier to which a drug is covalently
bound to. Such conjugated drugs exist as a method for modifying pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of
compounds6.
