Description:
Important molecular switches that can be photochemically switched between the thermodynamically more stable E isomer and the metastable Z isomer.

Text:
Azobenzenes are important molecular switches that can be 
photochemically switched between the thermodynamically 
more stable Eisomer and the metastable Zisomer.1 Exceptions 
exist, in which the stabilities are reversed.2 They show a high 
thermal3 and photochemical stability,4 and the switching 
mechanisms are well understood.5 Using targeted syntheses, it 
is often possible to obtain certain properties.

Description:
Compounds that can reach thermally stable Z-isomers and absorb visible light.

Text:
Current research focuses on orthosubstituted azobenzenes 
to reach thermally stable Zisomers or an absorption in the 
visible range of light.12, 1415 Switching occurs with wavelengths 
as long as 720 nm,16 and the PSS can be very selective (PSSZ 91 
and PSSE 86 for tetraorthofluorinated azobenzene).14 In 
addition, they show some of the highest thermal stabilities in 
the Zform (a halflife of 92 h at 60 C in acetonitrile has been 
reported for the tetraorthofluorinated azobenzene).15a 
Despite the utility of orthosubstituted azobenzenes, there 
are few synthetic methods available for their synthesis (Scheme 
1a).3, 17 They can be prepared from appropriately substituted 
anilines15a, 15c, 18 and further functionalized via nucleophilic 
substitution,19 or through transition metalcatalyzed CH 
activation.15e, 20 In this fashion, azobenzenes decorated with 
carbon,21 oxygen,21a, 22 nitrogen19b, 23 and halide19b, 20 
substituents in the orthoposition have been synthesized.
