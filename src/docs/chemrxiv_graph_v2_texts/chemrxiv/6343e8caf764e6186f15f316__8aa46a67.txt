The discovery of graphene has triggered an explosive development of twodimensional (2D) 
materials with fascinating properties and exceptional application potential,1 including transition 
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),2 hexagonal boron nitride (hBN),3 black phosphorous (BP).4 
Recent years have witnessed the rise of their amorphous counterparts, namely amorphous 2D (a
2D) materials.5 The combination of atomic thinness and lack of longrange order has endowed a
2D materials with unique characteristics, such as ultrahigh uniformity, excellent mechanical and 
chemical stability, and abundance in catalyticactive sites, promoting their applications in 
flexible electronics, electrocatalysis, and energy storage.5 Consequently, substantial efforts have 
been devoted to the bottomup synthesis of a2D materials.
