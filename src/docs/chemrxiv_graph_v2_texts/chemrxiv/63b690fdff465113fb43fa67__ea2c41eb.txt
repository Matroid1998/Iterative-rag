Description:
Atoms that form part of the inorganic layers in metal halide perovskites.

Text:
In the last few years there has been a growing interest around layered or socalled two
dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites (MHPs) for their superior moisture and air stability, 
thanks to which they found application in photovoltaics to design 2D3D solar cells 
architectures.1 The most investigated families of 2D perovskites are the RuddlesdenPopper 
(RP) and DionJacobson (DJ) phases of general formula A2An1MnX3n1 and AAn1MnX3n1, 
respectively, where A and A are organic cations, and n represents the number of staggered 
inorganic layers made of metal M and halide X atoms.2 Leadbased members with n1 of the 
RP family, i.e.
