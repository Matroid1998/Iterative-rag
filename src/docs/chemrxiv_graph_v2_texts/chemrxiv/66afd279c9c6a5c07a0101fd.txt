Description:
A homopolymeric, polydisperse RNA used as a polyanion in active complex coacervate droplets.

Text:
In this con
text, active droplets do not exist in equilibrium but require a chemi
cal reaction to sustain themselves.36,37 Theory on such droplets has 
predicted that active coacervate droplets can undergo division due 
to shape deformation despite the surface tension.38 However, the 
number of examples of selfdivision in active coacervates is limited. We recently found an example of active coacervatebased droplets 
that can selfdivide.39 These active complex coacervate droplets 
comprise the homopolymeric, polydisperse RNA (polyuridylic 
acid, polyU) as a polyanion and a peptide as a polycation.
