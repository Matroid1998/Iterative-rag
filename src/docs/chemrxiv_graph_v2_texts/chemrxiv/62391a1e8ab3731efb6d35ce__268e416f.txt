Description:
A repurposed drug used in the treatment of COVID-19 with modest effect on disease outcome.

Text:
Currently approved therapies for infection by SARSCoV2, the etiological agent of the COVID19 pandemic, 
 include monoclonal antibodies and certain repurposed drugs such as dexamethasone. Monoclonal antibody 
 therapy suffers from difficult logistics to administer, and the approved repurposed drugs have only modest 
 effect on disease outcome. Some novel therapeutics developed for coronaviruses 1,2 as well as further 
 repurposed drugs 3 are under regulatory review as antivirals for SARSCoV2. Each has its own strengths but 
 also drawbacks such as perceived concerns about mutagenicity, time to production rampup, or sideeffect 
 profile.
