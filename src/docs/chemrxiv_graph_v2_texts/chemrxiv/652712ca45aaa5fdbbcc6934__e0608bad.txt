The global initiative to reduce methane emissions from the energy sector has gained substan
35
tial momentum because of its pivotal role in combating global warming. 2 Methane emissions
36
are the second most prevalent greenhouse gas (GHG) after CO2, with a global warming po
37
tential (GWP) that is 863 times higher than CO2, over a 20year time frame. Accurately
38
quantifying these emissions stands as a fundamental prerequisite in the pursuit of eective
39
methane emission reduction policies. 40
The natural gas system is the second largest anthropogenic source of methane in the
41
U.S., spanning from production and processing to transmission and distribution.

Description:
A gas with emissions primarily from compressors and compressor drivers in midstream facilities.

4 This study
42
focuses on the midstream sector which includes gathering and processing (GP) as well
43
as transmission and storage (TS) segments. Midstream facilities are complex in nature
44
and typically include gas treating and compression equipment, with the largest source of
45
methane emissions being from compressors and compressor drivers, particularly reciprocating
46
engines.5,6 This study enrolled ve GP and nine TS facilities operated by six dierent
47
midstream companies. 48
Methane emissions on midstream facilities are typically divided into three categories. 68
49
Fugitive emissions, at times called leaks are unintended, unknown releases of unburned gas,
50
venting is the release of unburned gas for known and planned reasons, such as maintenance
51
activities or to drive valve controllers or pumps.
