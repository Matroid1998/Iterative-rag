Description:
A compound used in enzymatic assembly with serine.

Text:
Amino acids 3 and 4 were obtained by enzymatically assembling 4
cyanoindole (1) or azulene (2) with serine using a tryptophan synthase 
subunit (TrpB) variant (Tm9D8) developed by Arnold and co
workers.14 Treatment of 3 and 4 with N(chloroacetoxy)succinimide 
gave intermediates 5 and 6 in moderate yields. Finally, esterification 
of the carboxylic acids with chloroacetonitrile installed the CME 
functionality of 7 and 8 (Scheme 1).
