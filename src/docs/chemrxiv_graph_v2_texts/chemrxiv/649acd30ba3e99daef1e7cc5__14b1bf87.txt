Description:
Amino acids with nucleophilic sidechains that react with electrophilic acrylamides.

Text:
This can be achieved
through developing targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) with high selectivity.1113 The bind
ing of a covalent drug usually consists in the reaction of an electrophilic warhead of the ligand
with a nucleophilic sidechain in the protein, such as acrylamides reacting with cysteines.14
By choosing specific chemical functions (warheads)15 and optimizing the combination of re
