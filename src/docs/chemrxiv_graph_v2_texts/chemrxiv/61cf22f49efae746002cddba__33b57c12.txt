Description:
Synthesized using 4cyano ECPP and applied in Aldol-Ullmann reaction.

Text:
3Cyano ECPP 
was involved in AgNO3catalysed intramolecular cyclization leading to functionalized 
cyclopentanones and spirocyclopentanones 7. It also was reported in studies of 
adeninebased coordination polymers 8. 4Cyano ECPP is reported in synthesis of 1,7
bis (Nsubstitutedaminomethyl)2,8dihydroxytrogers bases and their application in 
AldolUllmann reaction 9 and also in studies on synthesis, antitumor activity and 
molecular docking of seven novel thiazacridine derivatives 10. 4Dimethylamino ECPP
