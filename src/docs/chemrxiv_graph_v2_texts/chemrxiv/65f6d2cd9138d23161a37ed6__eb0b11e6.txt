Description:
Leads to ligand addition of an available solvent molecule in many solvents.

Text:
The production of 1Fe(CO)4 leads to ligand ad
dition of an available solvent molecule in many solvents, namely alkane,4,5 alcohol6,7 and
alkylsilanes.8 Pumpprobe IR studies of Fe(CO)5 in methanol, 1butanol, 1hexanol, and
tertbutyl alcohol indicate that dynamics in the singlet manifold is rapidly involving coordi
