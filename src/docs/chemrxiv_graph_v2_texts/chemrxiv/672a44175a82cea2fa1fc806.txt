Description:
A key component in Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) known for high energy density and extended lifespan.

Text:
Electrochemical energy cells (EECs) are devices that work through a redox (reductionoxidation) 
reaction. Between them we have energy storage devices, like LithiumIon Batteries (LIBs) cells, and energy 
conversion devices, like Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). Both applications play a 
crucial role towards the green transition needed to mitigate climate change. Given the intermittent 
production of renewable energy sources and an ondemand consumption requirement, EECs can help to 
better integrate these energy sources into the energy matrix. On one side, LIBs present a high energy 
density, extended lifespan, and low selfdischarge that has significantly impacted various industries, 
including electronics and telecommunications, and served as key components in portable devices.1 2 LIBs 
are also contributing to the electrification of the transportation industry by being used in electric vehicles 
(EVs).
