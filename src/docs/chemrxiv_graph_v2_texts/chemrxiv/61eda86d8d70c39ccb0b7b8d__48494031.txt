Important materials in the semiconductor industry with applications in optoelectronics.

The group 13 nitrides (13Ns), aluminum (AlN), gallium (GaN) and indium nitride (InN) are 
important materials in the semiconductor industry 1. They range in bandgap from the wide 
gap of 6.0 eV for AlN 2, to the narrow 0.7 eV for InN 3 with GaN at an intermediate gap of 
3.4 eV 4. This bandgap range covers ultraviolet to infrared and thus contains the full visible 
spectrum making the 13Ns well suited for optoelectronics such as LEDs 5,6. InN has also a 
very high electron mobility and electron saturation velocity making it suited for high frequency 
transistors 7,8. To use the 13Ns in these applications they need to form thin films with high crystalline quality, 
conformity, and low impurity levels.
