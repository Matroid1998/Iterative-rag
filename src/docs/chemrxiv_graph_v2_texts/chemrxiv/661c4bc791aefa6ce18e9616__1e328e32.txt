Description:
A highly functionalized aminoglycoside used as an antibiotic, commercially available as a mixture of components differing in methylation and stereochemistry.

Text:
Aminoglycosides are an important class of antibiotics used in the treatment of several bacterial 
infections, particularly those caused by gramnegative strains1,2,3. These antibiotics are highly 
functionalized molecules derived from the glycolytic pathway and usually contain an 
aminocyclitol, including 2deoxystreptamine (2DOS), as aglycone4,5. These molecules inhibit 
protein synthesis by binding to the Asite in the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and interfering 
with the molecular basis of translation fidelity6. Gentamicin is one of the most functionalized 
aminoglycosides. The commercial form is a mixture containing 5 components, which have 
differences in the methylation level and stereochemistry of a methyl group at position C6 of their 
unusual sugar rings2.

Description:
An antibiotic used in lung infections and urinary infections, with restricted use due to nephrotoxic and ototoxic effects.

Text:
These components are denominated as gentamicin complex C (C1, C1a, C2, 
C2a and C2b) (Figure 1)7 and due to their minor differences, the separation of each component is 
challenging8. The individual components differ in their nephrotoxic and ototoxic effects9, so the 
individual properties of each compound are a strategy to be explored for safer use or in the 
development of new gentamicin derivatives7. Gentamicin is largely used in lung infections, 
particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis and in urinary infections which are difficult to treat10,11, 
but its use is restricted due to its toxic effects12,13. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202418hp0 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000253120191 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
