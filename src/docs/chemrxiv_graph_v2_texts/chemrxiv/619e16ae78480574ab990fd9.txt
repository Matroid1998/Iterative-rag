Description:
A fundamental element in organic molecules, often forming the backbone of molecular structures.

A reliable MLbased prediction of  could ll exactly
this gap  providing signicant speedups for the assess
ment of thousands of molecules while potentially allowing
for the extraction of robust chemical rules by explainable
AI.32 MLbased approaches were indeed recently success
ful for the prediction of  for rigid molecules,33 while ex
ible molecules still pose a signicant challenge,34 likely
because  simultaneously depends on two potential en
ergy surfaces (see Fig. 1). In this contribution we therefore critically study the
ML prediction of  (specically for hole conduction) as
a challenging problem for chemical machine learning. To this end, we present a new dataset of hybrid DFT
level reorganization energies for 10.900 carbon and hy
drogen containing molecules consisting of up to sixty
atoms and ve rotatable bonds.
