Description:
Reviewed for their protolytic equilibriums, focusing on 1H and 2H tautomeric equilibriums.

Text:
Much effort has been made by Wentrup et. al. 1 in the study of tautomeric 
equilibrium of 5X1,2,3,4Tetrazoles both by theory and experiments specially on 1H and 
2H tautomeric equilibrium of both in gas phase and solution phase. There was an excellent 
review on tetrazoles published by Trifonov and Ostrovskii 2 emphasizing the protolytic 
equilibriums. In both these studies importance is given mainly on the study of 1H  2H 
tautomeric equilibriums. It is to be noted that UVVis, dipole moments and NMR techniques 
were employed in the entire study of 1H and 2H tautomeric equilibriums 1,2.
