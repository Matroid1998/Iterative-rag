Description:
An anisotropic layered compound forming in space group R3m with a different structure from EuIn2P2.

Text:
Compounds containing lanthanides (R), heavy met
als (M), and pnictides (X), especially those with Eu,
may combine magnetic ordering, spinorbitcoupling
induced anisotropy, and topologically nontrivial trans
port properties. For example, the EuInP ternary sys
tem contains the highly anisotropic 2D layered com
pound EuIn2P2 (space group P63mmc) with large
magnetoresistance,1 and a pair of orthorhombic com
pounds with narrow band gaps and tunable magnetism
in Eu3InP3 (Pnma)2 and Eu3In2P4 (Pnnm).3 The Eu
SnP ternary system adds one electron but still con
tains a similar set of phases, including the anisotropic
layered compound EuSn2P2 (R3m),4 which forms in
a different space group from EuIn2P2 because the lat
ter has an InIn bond to satisfy the Zintl concept of
valenceprecise bonding after donation of the Eu2
electrons.
