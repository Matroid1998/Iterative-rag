Description:
A compound involved in sequestration through precipitation and mineral carbonation.

Text:
Alkaline and alkalineearth metal carbonates serve in several important applications in 
geophysical1, biological2 and industrial3 domain. Due to their high melting temperatures, they 
possess properties like high thermal and ionic properties making them suitable for fuel cells.4 Metal 
carbonates precipitation and mineral carbonation is currently one of the viable routes for carbon 
dioxide sequestration5. Solvation is an efficient way to precipitate metal carbonates and in 
determining the longterm stability of carbonates. Aqueous environments act as catalysts for metal 
ions to bind with carbonate anions leading to nucleation and precipitation in solution6. Thermodynamics play an important role in nucleation and crystal growth in solution and therefore 
understanding the solvationreaction dynamics at ambient and high temperatures is crucial.
