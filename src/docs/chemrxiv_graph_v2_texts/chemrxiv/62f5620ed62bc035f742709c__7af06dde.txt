Description:
Highly electron-deficient and unstable intermediates.

Text:
The possibility to exploit photonic energy in organic syn
thetic endeavors has dramatically impacted the way chem
ists assemble molecules. In particular, photocatalysis has 
enabled a convenient entry to openshell intermediates,1 
spurring the development of efficient manifolds for the gen
eration of C,2 N3 and O4 centered radicals, as well as halo
gen radicals,5 which can be subsequently used to forge new 
chemical bonds.6 In contrast, boronbased congeners have 
long remained in obscurity,7 mainly due to the intrinsic dif
ficulties associated with the handling of these highly elec
trondeficient and unstable intermediates. However, ligated 
boryl radicals (LBRs),8 i.e.
