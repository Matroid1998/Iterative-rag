Description:
A neurotransmitter whose receptors, especially D2, are inhibited by phenothiazine.

Text:
Phenothiazine (PTZ) is a heterocyclic pharmaceutical lead structure in medicinal 
chemistry,1 representing a major class of antipsychotic drugs that have an inhibitory effect 
against dopaminergic receptors, especially D2 receptor.2 Derivatives of PTZ have been 
extensively used to treat psychosis, including schizophrenia, violent, agitated, disturbed 
behaviour and bipolar disorder.3 While these medications are effective, side effects of PTZs 
include 1) the autonomic and cardiovascular systems, endocrinologic, metabolic, hematologic, 
hepatic, allergicdermatologic, ophthalmologic, and anticholinergic effects; 2) the central 
nervous system, including extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome, seizure, and sedation; 3) the sexual and reproductive side effects, 
including sexual dysfunction, and teratogenicity.4 These side effects are primarily caused by 
the PTZs nonselective blocking of receptors in the central nervous system, including 
dopamine (D1 and D2), muscarinic, histamine H1, and serotonergic 5hydroxytryptamine (HT) 
2 receptors.5 Clinical studies have shown that these side effects occur due to bioactive 
metabolites, which may significantly contribute to the toxicity in humans.6 Sulfoxide 
metabolites has been annotated to be responsible for cardiotoxic activity,7 and 7
hydroxylated metabolite of the PTZs, form an electrophilic quinone imine intermediate, which 
is responsible for mechanisms of druginduced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity.8 PTZ analogues 
are classified into three groups, as shown in Table 1.19
