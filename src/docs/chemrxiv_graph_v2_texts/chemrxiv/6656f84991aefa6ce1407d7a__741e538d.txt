Description:
Functionalised silica nanoparticles are used in various applications.

Text:
Examples from the field 
of inorganic (nano)materials include functionalised silica nanoparticles,9,10 layered 
hydroxyapatite,11 as well as purified natural clay minerals (e.g., montmorillonite12) and clays 
modified with organic surfactants13 or other agents.14 
Zeolites are crystalline inorganic materials whose structures are built up by a framework of 
cornersharing TO4 tetrahedra.15 Most natural zeolites and the majority of synthetic zeolites 
have an aluminosilicate composition (T  Si, Al), resulting in a negative framework charge that 
is balanced by extraframework cations or framework protons.
