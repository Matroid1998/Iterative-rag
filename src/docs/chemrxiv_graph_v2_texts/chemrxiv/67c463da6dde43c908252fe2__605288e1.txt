of MPI into clinical settings. As MPI is a tracer
based imaging method, the design and development of responsive tracers for functional imaging are 
particularly appealing. Here, we report on Mnferrite (MnxFe3xO4) nanoparticles with finely tuned 
magnetic properties and enzymelike capabilities as potential multifunctional theranostic agents. By 
adjusting the Mn content in the iron oxide matrix, we can tweak the magnetic particle imaging signal of 
different tracers, allowing for the simultaneous quantitative detection of two different tracers in a multi
color approach. The Mn2FeO4 tracers exhibit potent enzymelike catalytic properties, enabling the 
degradation of reactive oxygen species, including H2O2 and OH.
