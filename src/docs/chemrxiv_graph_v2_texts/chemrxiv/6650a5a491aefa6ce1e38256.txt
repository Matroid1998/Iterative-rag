Description:
A volatile transient signaling molecule.

Text:
Human blood products (plasma and serum) provide a gateway to the study of endogenous and 
exogenous substrate metabolism, including microbial cometabolism, as influenced through the 
expression of human and microbial genetics, changes in nutrition, exposure to environmental factors, 
infection and disease, and other stimuli1. Both plasma and serum are commonly studied2 for the 
discovery of diagnostic and prognostic metabolic biomarkers which can be translated into clinical 
practice or used in the development of therapeutics. The chemical compositions of plasma and serum 
are complex, ranging from volatile transient signaling molecules (e.g. nitric oxide), small polar 
metabolites (e.g. organic acids), larger and more hydrophobic molecules (e.g. sterols, steroids, bile 
acids, drug metabolites), complex and neutral lipids, peptides and larger macromolecules (e.g. protein 
and lipoprotein species).
