at ambient temperatures.1720 Recent studies have shown small
scale localized in situ CO2 gas adsorption followed by photocatalytic conversion in homogeneous 
and colloidal solutions.2123 Nevertheless, sunlightdriven direct capture and utilization processes 
with industrially relevant aminehydroxide capturing agents is lacking, presumably due to the 
overwhelming energy barrier to activate the trapped CO2adducts (Figure S1).24 
Here we report an integrated CO2 capture and solardriven photoelectrochemical (PEC) 
utilization process to produce syngas (mixture of CO and H2), a precursor for industrial liquid 
fuels and chemicals syntheses,25 from concentrated CO2 stream, simulated postcombustion flue 
gas, and atmospheric air. The process operates by combining CO2tofuel reduction with 
selective oxidation of waste plasticderived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA), which 
has applications in pharmaceutical, food and textile industries (Figure 1b).
