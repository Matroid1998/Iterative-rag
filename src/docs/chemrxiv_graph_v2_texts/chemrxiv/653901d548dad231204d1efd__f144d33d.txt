Description:
A Cl-bearing molecule detected in and around the interstellar medium.

However, prior to the launch of Herschel, H35Cl and H37Cl were the only Clbearing molecules
detected in and around the ISM 4, 5, 6, 7. This can be explained by the fact that the H2Cl ion transforms
into hydrogen chloride, HCl by dissociative recombination or by proton transfer to carbon monoxide CO. In
addition to the detection by Herschel, another study reported by Neufeld et al 8, also detected absorption and
emission of H2Cl from two interstellar cloud sources. The chemical reactions that give rise to the deuterated
forms HDCl and D2Cl are similar to those giving the chloronium ion, H2Cl, with the same orders of
magnitude of the reaction rate coefficient. It follows that, like the chloronium ion, its deuterated isotopologues
should be abundant in the ISM.
