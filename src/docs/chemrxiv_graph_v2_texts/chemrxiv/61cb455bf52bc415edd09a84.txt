Description:
A chiral compound used in the design of polymers with chirality transcription.

Text:
To achieve the goal of an easy setup for 
structuring chiral polymers, in this work, we have envisioned the molecular design and development 
of novel polymers with a chirality transcription by incorporating chiral 2.2paracyclophane derivatives 
into the polymer by employing anionic and radical polymerization with the possibility of post
polymerization modification.
