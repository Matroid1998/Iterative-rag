Description:
A greenhouse gas targeted for reduction to 350 ppm by 2100 through various methods including direct air capture.

Text:
In the pursuit of achieving the ambitious target of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to 
350 ppm by 2100,1 even after comprehensive decarbonization efforts across various sectors, managing 
residual CO2 from industrial activities will remain a challenge. Various approaches will need to be adopted, 
ranging from reforestation efforts to direct air capture (DAC) technologies. While DAC is still an emerging 
field, there are pilot and commercial plants actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere, such as 
Climeworks (Iceland), Global Thermostat (USA), Holocene (USA), Mission Zero (United Kingdom), 
Avnos (USA), Verdox (USA), Heirloom (USA), and Carbon Engineering (Canada).
