Description:
Formed as a solid via the Boudouard reaction.

Besides these benefits for Fe based catalysts, additional watergasshift 
24 
(WGS, (3)) activity has to be considered as a competing reaction in CO2 hydrogenation 23, 
25 
while solid carbon formation via Boudouard reaction (4) and the formation of ethylene (5) as 
26 
major byproduct plays a potential role for CO hydrogenation under low temperature and
