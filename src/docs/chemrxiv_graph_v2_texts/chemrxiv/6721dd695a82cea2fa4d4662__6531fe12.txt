An element used for doping graphene to control its electronic properties.

have demonstrated the tunability of the
edge states of the bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with the twist angle and
stacking offset.13
There are a lot of studies on the effect of molecule adsorption on the electronic structure
of pristine and doped graphene, armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons.14,15 Hou et
al. reported that the edge functionalization of ZGNRs with a radical can result in gapped
ferromagnetic (FM) ZGNRs which can be further controlled by the doping of B or N atoms in
the coupling pathway.1618 The electronic structure of molecules adsorbed systems provides a
good estimate of the induced spin polarization.
