Description:
A biodegradable substrate with high water solubility and ease of production.

The 
commonly 
available 
degradable 
substrates 
includes 
polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), 
poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA), and potentially derived from 
renewable resources like corn starch, cellulose, or polylactic 
acid (PLA).2 These substrates can break down naturally into 
harmless byproducts thereby reducing environmental impact. Among these, we choose PVA as a substrate in our study 
owing to their biodegradability, high watersolubility and the 
ease of production.3 By using these biodegradable polymer 
substrates, we can mitigate the adverse effects of traditional 
plastics on ecosystems, marine life, and human health. Additionally, they offer versatility in applications while 
maintaining functionality and durability. A biodegradable temperature sensor represents a 
significant advancement in the field of sustainable 
technology. These sensors are typically made from 
biocompatible and biodegradable materials.
