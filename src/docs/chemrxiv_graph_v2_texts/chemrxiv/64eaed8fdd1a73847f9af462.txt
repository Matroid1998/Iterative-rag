Apart from ubiquitous biomass sources, the greenhouse gas CO2 can be used as an abundant 
carbon source to produce energyrich chemicals such as CO, formate, hydrocarbons or 
alcohols.12 However, photo and electroreduction of CO2 are predominantly performed in the 
presence of pure CO2, where concentrated CO2 streams have to be generated involving 
additional energy input.1315 To alleviate the energy demand of the process, it is desirable to 
perform catalytic reactions at lower CO2 concentrations (e.g.,  20 CO2).1620 The challenge 
of using low concentration CO2 streams lies in maintaining high product selectivity and 
catalytic activity compared to reactions employing pure CO2 streams.17 Molecular CO2 
reduction catalysts display an increased product selectivity compared to most heterogenous 
electro or photocatalysts.16, 21, 22 
An attractive approach to utilise biomass and CO2 together is their simultaneous conversion 
in photo or electrocatalytic processes.2325 This strategy opens the possibility to couple 
biomass oxidation with CO2 reduction in a single process driven by sunlight or renewable 
electricity.
