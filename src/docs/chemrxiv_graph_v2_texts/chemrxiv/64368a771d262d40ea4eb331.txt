Description:
Forms different oxides depending on crystallographic orientation.

Text:
studied the influence of differ
ent Cu lowindexed crystallographic orienta
tions regarding the Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxide for
mation.37 Scholten et al. were able to show
that O2 plasma pretreatment leads to the for
mation of CuO on the Cu(111) surface, while
on Cu(100) primarily Cu2O is formed after the
same experimental procedure. Also, the sur
face morphology in both cases differed signifi
cantly.38 The different structures obtained on
the different facets during the pretreatment
can have a significant impact on the catalytic
activity.39 A caveat of using such oriented sin
gle crystals is that several differently oriented
single crystals are required, to study the facet
dependent properties, which is a rather time
consuming task.
