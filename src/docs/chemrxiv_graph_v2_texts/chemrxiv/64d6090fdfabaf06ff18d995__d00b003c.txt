Description:
A heteroaromatic substituent that can be tolerated in transformations without greatly compromising yield.

Text:
In contrast, a substrate bearing a nitrile group at the amide acarbon led to the formation of a complex reaction 
120 
mixture, and we were unable to isolate or identify the spirocyclic product 2j in the crude reaction mixture. This result 
121 
prompted us to suspect that electronic changes at the amide acarbon may have a profound influence on overall 
122 
reactivity. To further test this hypothesis, we investigated a series of aryl substrates bearing electronically distinct 
123 
substituents. The transformation was able to tolerate the presence of heteroaromatic 3pyridyl (2k, 63, 201 d.r. 124 
141 r.r.) and 3fluoroaryl (2l, 64, 201 d.r., 201 r.r.) substituents without compromising yield too greatly.
