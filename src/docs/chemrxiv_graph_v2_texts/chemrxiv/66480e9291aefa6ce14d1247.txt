Description:
Emission reduction goals have been set by IATA and ATAG to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% for 2050 relative to 2005 levels.

The global aviation industry accounts for approximately 12 of emissions from all transportation 
sources 1. Airbus A320 can burn 2,430 Lh of fuel, meaning that a twohour domestic flight 
requires over 5,000 liters of jet fuel. Meanwhile, a Boeing 747400 consumes 10,230 Lh of fuel, 
and flying from London to New York can burn up to 82,000 liters of fuel 2. The need for sus
tainable alternatives to fossil fuels has been well acknowledged. The International Air Transport 
Association (IATA) and Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) set CO2 emission reduction goals 
of 50 for 2050 (relative to 2005 levels) 3.
