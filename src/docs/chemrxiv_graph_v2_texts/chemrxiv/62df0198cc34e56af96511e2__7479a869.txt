Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) exhibit exceptional mechanical properties at higher 
temperatures, electrical insulation, and radiation shielding 16. BNNTs have recently been 
shown to be an excellent reinforcement in nanocomposite materials 1, 7, 8. However, to 
efficiently and effectively fabricate highperformance BNNTreinforced polymer matrix 
composites (PMCs), a thorough understanding of the BNNTpolymer interfacial interaction is 
needed. Resinreinforcement wettability is a key design parameter in the manufacturing of highquality 
PMCs. Wettability is often quantified by determining the contact angle of resin liquid droplets on 
reinforcement surfaces. Experimental measurement of contact angle is an expensive and a 
complex procedure. Fortunately, molecular dynamics (MD) can be used to simulate the

interaction at composite interfaces, predict resinreinforcement contact angle, and provide 
physical insight into observed interfacial behavior 916.
