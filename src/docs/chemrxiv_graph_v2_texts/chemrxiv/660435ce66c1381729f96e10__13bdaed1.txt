Text:
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an attractive C1 building block for the construction of more complex organic 
molecules. In the past few years there has been increased interest in reactions that combine two (or 
more) molecules of CO to construct carbon chains.15 Controlling selectivity in these reactions is 
important; both the chain length and the ratio of CHO are key factors.
