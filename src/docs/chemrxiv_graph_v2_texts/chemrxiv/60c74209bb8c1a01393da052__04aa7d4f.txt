Description:
A Keggin anion present in a cubic crystalline unit cell.

The later works of Rao et al28 and 
later Narasimharao et al29 in particular explored the effect of up to 
200 MGy  irradiation on AMP, with no negative effects on ion 
exchange performance observed at 2 MGy exposure, though at 100 
MGy and above, the effect of radiation severely diminishes the 
desired action of AMP.29 The physiochemical properties of AMP were 
explored in some detail in the latter of these works.29 
AMP consists of a cubic crystalline unit cell containing the Keggin 
phosphomolybdate (PMo12O403, Figure 1) anion, surrounded by 
ammonium counter ions and water molecules.31 Cs is absorbed from 
aqueous solution by exchange with ammonium ions in the crystal 
lattice, as per Equation 1, where 0  x  3.
