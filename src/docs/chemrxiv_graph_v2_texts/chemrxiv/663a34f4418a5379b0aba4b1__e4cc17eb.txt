Description:
Groups generated on silica surface by TMA.

Text:
Additionally, 
upon reacting with silica, TMA generated SiCH3 groups on the surface, and the subsequent 
interaction with NH3, particularly at higher temperatures, led to the removal of over 90  of the 
initial CH3 groups, which aligned with the proposed reaction pathway for this process. A recent modelling study of the surface reconstruction after the NH3 pulse in ALD of AlN, GaN 
and InN,11 suggests that, at typical ALD temperatures and pressures, the AlN surface is 
predominantly covered by NH2 species at thermal equilibrium. The surface chemistry of TMA
