Used as an antimicrobial coating in ceramic water filters.

A yearlong study in 
Cameroon highlighted that SODIS provided up to a 42.5 reduction in the risk for diarrheal 
diseases in households that properly treated their water, but only 45.8 of all households 
effectively adhered to the recommended practices of SODIS.9 Ceramic water filters are 
another POU technology that can be produced with local materials and provide dual 
mechanisms to remove bacteria, i.e., the porous physical ceramic matrix filtration and silver 
nanoparticle antimicrobial coating.10,11 A randomized controlled field trial in Bolivia 
demonstrated the effectiveness of ceramic filters in meeting World Health Organization (WHO) 
drinkingwater standards. While results obtained proved valuable in achieving compliance 
when faced with turbid challenge waters, additional research is needed.
