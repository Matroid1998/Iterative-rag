Description:
A pseudocapacitive material with high theoretical capacity and stable cycling performance in aqueous electrolyte.

Pseudocapacitive materials operating in aqueous electrolytes offer the advantages of fast 
charging and high safety during their charge and discharge cycles, which are two crucial 
characteristics desired for electrochemical energy storage devices.1,2 Among the most 
promising pseudocapacitive materials, the birnessite MnO2 stands out due to its abundance, 
low cost, high theoretical capacity and stable cycling performance in aqueous electrolyte.310 
Moreover, its reaction mechanisms upon cycling in aqueous electrolytes (1M K2SO4), subject 
of debate, was recently elucidated by Augustyn et al.11 They demonstrated that birnessite 2D 
structure, with a large interlayer spacing resulting from the presence of nanoconfined structural 
water molecules, enables extremely fast and efficient intercalation of partially hydrated alkaline 
ions, leading to capacitive like electrochemical signature.
