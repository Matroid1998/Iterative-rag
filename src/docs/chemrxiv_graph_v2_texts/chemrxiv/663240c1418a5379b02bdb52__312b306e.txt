Description:
A class of compounds to which mangiferin belongs, characterized by a xanthone ring structure.

Text:
Mangiferin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic heterocyclic organic compound, 
also known as quinomine or alpizarin, that is generally found in plants such as 
Mangifera indica, which belongs to the class of Xanthones13. 1,3,6,7
tetrahydroxy2((2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)3,4,5trihydroxy6(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro
2Hpyran2yl)9Hxanthen9one, or mangiferin, has two of the important 
functionalized rings, xanthone and pyranose4. Broad research discovers its 
chemical and pharmaceutical properties, basically introducing structural 
modifications to its effectiveness with respect to various biological activities like 
antiinflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, immunosuppressive antitumour, 
antidiabetic, laxative, antiviral, cardiotonic, hemoptysis, analgesic, cytoprotective 
effect, antimalarial, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antipsychotic, antihypertensive 
activities etc556. Mangiferin has also exhibited good inhibitory activities on kinase 
family enzymes2127, 50, 5761. Mangiferin has gained great importance owing to its 
anticancer activity in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer6272.

Description:
A pharmacophoric moiety found in various drug candidates.

Text:
Various drug candidates are available pharmaceutically; containing xanthone and 
the pyranose ring as a pharmacophoric moiety, and are also available in clinical 
development to reveal the utility of mangiferin as a pharmacophoric molecule73. This review provides a comprehensive, detailed, and updated overview of 
mangiferin about chemistry and their diverse biological activities, covering 
patented and nonpatented literature. 2. General Synthetic Strategies of Mangiferin and its derivatives 
The significant research work of researchers has developed of various synthetic 
methodologies to synthesize numerous potential derivatives of mangiferin to 
manage and treat various diseases46, 74, 75. Some of which are defined in the 
schemes below
