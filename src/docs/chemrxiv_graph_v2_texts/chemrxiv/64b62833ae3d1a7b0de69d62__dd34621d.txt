Description:
Porous materials consisting of silicon and oxygen atoms.

Text:
In this work, for the first time, porous materials were successfully generated using a diffusion 
model. Specifically, pure silica zeolites that consist of silicon and oxygen atoms were targeted for 
the generation. Among the previous attempts made with regard to the design of zeolites and other
