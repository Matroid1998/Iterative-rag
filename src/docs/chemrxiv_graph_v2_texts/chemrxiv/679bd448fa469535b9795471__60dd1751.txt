Description:
Forms at the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction during electrolysis in aqueous electrolytes.

The interest in CGDE increased over the past
decades, where the technique has been dis
cussed for possible applications such as syn
thetic chemistry,5,6 wastewater treatment,710
surface modification,1113 or nanoparticle for
mation.1416 The processes during CGDE de
pend on the polarity of the driving electrode. Generally, during normal electrolysis (lower
voltages) in aqueous electrolytes, O2 forms at
the anode via the oxygen evolution reaction and
H2 at the cathode via the hydrogen evolution
reaction. During anodic CGDE, in addition to
O2, the formation of H2, H2O2, and other re
action intermediates (including radicals, ions,
etc.)
