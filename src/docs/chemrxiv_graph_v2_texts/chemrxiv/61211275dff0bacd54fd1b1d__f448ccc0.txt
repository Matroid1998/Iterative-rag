Description:
Has an essentially infinitely large exciton Bohr radius in its bulk form.

Text:
Nanographenes, such as graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and nanoribbons (GNRs), are light
harvesting chromophores that exhibit desirable excitonic properties for application in 
photocatalysis. The relative size of GQDs and GNRs constrain their excitons to a size that is 
smaller than the essentially infinitely large exciton Bohr radius of bulk graphene. Consequentially, excitons in these systems are quantumconfined, enabling size tunable energy 
gaps.1 Sizedependent tunability of the energy gap has been shown both theoretically2 and 
experimentally,3 demonstrating the versatility of lightharvesting in nanographenes.

Description:
Used in 0D2D van der Waals heterojunctions for photocatalytic reactions.

Text:
Zigzag derivatives contain more nodes and less sextets than 
their armchair analogs, which results in the destabilization of their HOMO levels and a 
narrowing of their energy gaps.5 Chemical functionalization with electrondonating groups have 
also been used to systematically engineer the energy gap of GQDs for application in 
photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction.6 These photocatalytic reactions have also been 
demonstrated for GQDs used in 0D2D van der Waals heterojunctions with graphene.7 GQDs 
can also selfassemble into stacked structures that efficiently harvest light along the stack810.
