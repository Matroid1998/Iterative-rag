Description:
Accounts for 79% of human-caused greenhouse gases.

Anthropogenic emissions are the leading cause of increased atmospheric greenhouse gas
27
(GHG) concentrations in the last 150 years. 1 Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts
28
for 79 of human caused GHGs, but methane (CH4) has a global warming potential that is
29
roughly 86 times higher than CO2 over a 20year period.2 The short atmospheric lifetime of
30
CH4 (12 years) and high warming potential means that a reduction in CH4 emissions would
31
have a nearterm eect on the radiative balance of the atmosphere and eorts to mitigate
32
climate change.1,3,4 The 2022 In ation Reduction Act (IRA) 5 included the Methane Emis
33
sions Reduction Program, notably a waste emissions charge for sites emitting over 25,000
34
metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).
