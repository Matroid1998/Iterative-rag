Compounds created through catalytic hydrosilylation of unsaturated bonds for multitudinous uses.

Catalytic hydrosilylation of unsaturated bonds has evolved into 
one powerful tool in creating organosilicon compounds for 
multitudinous uses.1 A substantial proportion of this rapidly 
developing field is the hydrosilylation of 1substituted alkenes, 
which has been well developed and widely used in building 
macromolecular organosilicon compounds of great industrial 
importance.2 For instance, various novel polycarbosilanes have 
been accessed through diverse hydrosilylation polymerization 
strategies (a, Scheme 1).3 Besides the numerous alterations in 
polymer backbones, the introduction of different side chains is 
expected to have potential beneficial impact on the properties 
of these intriguing materials.4 Polymerization based on 
hydrosilylation of 1,1,disubsituted alkenes would be one 
convenient and direct method to achieve this, through which 
functional substitutions could be anchored next to the silicon 
center (b, Scheme 1).
