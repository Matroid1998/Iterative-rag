Description:
Base unit used with annotated carbon positions.

Text:
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of (1,4)linked Dglucopyranose
units (Figure 1A).1,2 They are found naturally as macrocycles consisting of six (CD),
seven (CD) or eight (CD) glycopyranose units. The native CDs form hollow conelike

parameter tting to ensure overall charge neutrality when attached to 1,4D glucopyranose.
