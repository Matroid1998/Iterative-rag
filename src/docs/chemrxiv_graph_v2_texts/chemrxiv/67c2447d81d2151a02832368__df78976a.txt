Description:
Complexes that require a balance between strong binding and efficient nucleic acid release.

Text:
Strong binding and efficient nucleic acid release must be
carefully balanced because overly stable polyplexes can hin
der intracellular release, while weak complexes fail to pro
tect and transport cargo effectively into cells1214. Previ
ous studies have predominantly focused on optimizing trans
fection efficiency only by adjusting molecular weight15,16,
nitrogentophosphate (NP) ratios17, or complex formation
conditions1820. Other investigations have examined PEIDNA complex
ation mechanisms by examining factors such as binding
strength, stability, and structure. For example, Ketola et
al.2123 used fluorescence spectroscopy to reveal distinct dif
ferences in DNA cargo binding for linear and branched PEI
(LPEI and BPEI, respectively). Other studies suggest that
BPEI offers better DNA protection than LPEI, but lower de
livery efficiency24.
