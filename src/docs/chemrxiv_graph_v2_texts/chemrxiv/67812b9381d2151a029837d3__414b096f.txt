Description:
Involved in macrocyclic conjugation.

Text:
Except for a few examples 
involving the porphyrinoids 1 and 2,2,3,5 macrocyclic 
conjugation is impossible due to structural andor conformational 
features.6 On the other hand, metallocenes that are 1,2 and 1,3
disubstituted and incorporated into a cyclic framework (Figure 2) 
are exceedingly uncommon.7
