Description:
A product of CO2 reduction that can be influenced by the availability of local proton sources.

Text:
As a consequence, their reduction mechanisms were 
extensively explored. By finetuning electronic properties and 
steric hindrance around the metal centre, the selectivity and the 
activity of the electrocatalyst can be controlled.2830 The 
availability of local proton sources is known to greatly impact 
these two parameters, potentially enabling to shift the CO2 
reduction process from the production of CO to formate.29, 31 In 
particular, polypyridyl Mn(I) catalysts (e.g. Mn(pdbpy)(CO)3Br
