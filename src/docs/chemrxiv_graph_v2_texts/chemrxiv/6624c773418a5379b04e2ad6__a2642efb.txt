Description:
Part of the Pd(I) dimer (PtBu3)PdBr2, used as precatalysts for cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Pd(I) is the least understood oxidationstate for palla
dium species.18 However, in recent years, Pd(I) species have 
received increasing attention for their roles in Pdcatalyzed 
organic transformations.9,10 A number of dimeric Pd(I) com
pounds have proved effective catalysts for crosscoupling 
reactions.8,1115 As a notable example, the Pd(I) dimer 
(PtBu3)PdBr2 can function as the reservoir of the highly re
active 12electron Pd(0) species and has been applied as 
precatalysts for an array of CC and CN bond crosscoupling 
reactions.8,16 Mononuclear Pd(I) species are invoked as pu
tative intermediates in Pdcatalyzed halogenatomtransfer 
reactions,1720 
carbonylation 
reactions,21,22 
crosscou
plings,2328 as well as lightdriven Pdcatalyzed reactions.29
31 In these catalytic reactions, singleelectron redox reac
tions between Pd(0) species and organic halides and light
driven decomposition of Pd(II) species are proposed to 
yield Pd(I) intermediates.
