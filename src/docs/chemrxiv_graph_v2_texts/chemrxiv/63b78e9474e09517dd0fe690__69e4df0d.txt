Description:
A zirconium complex that can polymerize cyclic esters in its reduced form and epoxides in its oxidized form.

Of these 
compounds, a zirconium complex, (salfen)Zr(OiPr)2 (salfen  
N,Nbis(2,4ditertbutylphenoxy)1,1ferrocenediimine),54 
was investigated, and it was found that, in its reduced form, it 
can polymerize cyclic esters, such as llactide (LA), 
caprolactone, and valerolactone, while in its oxidized form, it 
can polymerize epoxides such as cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and 
propylene oxide.55 As a consequence, it proved to be a 
successful redox switchable copolymerization system, where 
diblock and triblock copolymers of LA and CHO were prepared.
