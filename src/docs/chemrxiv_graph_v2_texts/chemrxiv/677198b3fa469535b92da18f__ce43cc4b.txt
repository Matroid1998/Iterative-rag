Description:
Involved in lone pair donation from the imine group to a metal ion.

Text:
The capacity to 
promptly establish coordination with transition metals is paramount for the effective facilitation 
of proton reduction, a process that culminates in the generation of hydrogen gas 3. The formation of Schiff bases metal complexes occurs through a process of lone pair donation 
from the nitrogen atom (from the imine group, CN) to a metal ion 4. This process essentially 
functions as a ligand, thereby coordinating with the metal center through the electronrich site. The 
structural characteristics of Schiff bases permit the existence of multiple coordination sites 5, 
thus facilitating the formation of stable complexes with various metal ions, contingent upon the 
specific design of the ligand.
