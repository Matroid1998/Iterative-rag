Description:
A resource that can be transformed into liquid fuels and basic chemicals.

Text:
Syngas (COH2) serves as a crucial platform for transforming the nonpetroleum carbon 
resources, such as coal, natural gas, shale gas and biomass, into liquid fuels and basic chemicals. 13 In that context, major efforts have focused on the direct conversion of syngas into ethanol, 
an ideal fuel additive, promising hydrogen carrier, and versatile buildingblock in chemical 
synthesis.48 Among potential candidates, Rhbased catalysts show promising ethanol 
selectivity in syngas conversion in the presence of specific additives, socalled promoters.912 
Among them, Fe has been shown to be particularly efficient to trigger ethanol production of 
Rhbased catalysts.9, 1317 However, the promotional effect of Fe under syngas conversion 
conditions remains poorly understood, partly because of the illdefined catalyst structures 
resulting from conventional synthetic approaches.
