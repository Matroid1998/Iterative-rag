Lipidomics is a growing field that aims to characterize the complete set of all lipids 
in a biological matrix1. Lipids are a diverse group of biomolecules and serve a wide variety 
of functions in living organisms. The LIPID MAPS Structure Database2,3 represents the 
largest repository of lipid structures, housing 48,205 structures as of 2023, both from 
curated and computationally generated sources. Glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids 
are commonly associated with membrane structure, lipidprotein interactions and cell 
signaling events4. Neutral lipid classes, such as triacylglycerols (TG), diacylglycerols (DG) 
and cholesterol esters (CE) have critical roles in energy metabolism, membrane fluidity 
regulation and signaling pathways5. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) 
platforms are the primary tool for lipidomics applications, due to their sensitivity, qualitative 
and quantitative data insights and highthroughput capabilities6.
