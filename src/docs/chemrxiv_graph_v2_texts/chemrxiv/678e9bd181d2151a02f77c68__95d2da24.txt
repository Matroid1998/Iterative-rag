Description:
Can be generated insitu as a radical anion and functions as a single electron transfer reductant or nucleophile.

Insitu generation of the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO2) using mild reaction 
conditions is a general goal for the activation of organic molecules.16 CO2 can be accessed 
photochemically via hydrogenatom abstraction from formate (HCO2) or electrochemically by 
CO2 reduction.16 Once generated, CO2 enables a variety of followup organic reactions, including 
hydrodehalogenation,1719 carboarylation,2022 oxyarylation,23 radical deamination,17, 18 aldehyde 
reduction,17 Birch reduction,24 sulfonamide cleavage,17, 
19 and the carboxylation (or 
decarboxylation) of a wide variety of unsaturated CC bonds.17, 2531 In each of the aforementioned 
examples, CO2 functions either as a single electron transfer (SET) reductant or as a nucleophile, 
depending on the formal reduction potential (E0) and the electrophilicity of the organic substrate.
