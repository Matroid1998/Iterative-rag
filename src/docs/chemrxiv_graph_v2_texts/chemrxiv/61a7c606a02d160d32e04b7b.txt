Description:
Acts as a precursor reduced by BSA in the formation of gold nanoclusters.

The very broad field of potential 
applications of these systems has been covered in several excellent reviews.915 Surprisingly, 
while the perspective of reallife applications of albuminconjugated AuNCs is becoming 
increasingly clear, the underlying mechanisms through which the complexes are formed and 
luminescence intensity is affected by changing environmental factors are not understood in 
sufficient detail.1619 In the case of the Xies protocol involving alkaline pH, BSA acts as both 
a reducing agent for chloroauric(III) acid and a macromolecular ligand subsequently 
enveloping formed AuNCs. The latter function is essential, as bare AuNCs are unstable and 
prone to selfassembly into larger metallic and therefore nonluminescent nanoparticles 
(AuNPs).
