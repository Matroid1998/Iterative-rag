Description:
A precursor used in the enzymatic synthesis of terpene esters.

Text:
Research on enzymatic synthesis routes for these terpene esters from geraniol and citronellol 
has gained popularity over the last decade owing to the increasing demand for environmentally 
greener processes. They offer several benefits such as milder reaction conditions, reusability, 
and less byproducts owing to the regio and stereoselectivity of enzymes. 4. Lipases from 
Pseudomonas Fluorescens and Candida Antarctica have been effectively employed in various 
reactions such as esterification 5 and transesterification 6. The kinetics and mechanisms of 
these enzymatic processes have also been well reported in literature 712. The utilisation of 
microwave irradiation combined with enzymes has shown an enhancement of the 
biotransformation process and reduction of energy consumption 13. Adarme et al.

demonstrated an integrated system for the continuous synthesis and purification of terpene 
esters, which led to the intensification of terpene ester biosynthesis. Flower biomass is an attractive alternative feedstock as they are rich in terpenebased materials 
and easy to process due to low lignin content compared to other agricultural biomass. South 
Asian countries such as India produce 3.5 tonnes of flower waste daily, which can serve as a 
carbonneutral and scalable alternative feedstock 15. Therefore, valorising flower biomass 
will align with the sustainable development goals of the United Nation (UN) and will aid in 
achieving the UKs NetZero target by 2050. Geraniol and citronellol are the major constituents 
of many flower essential oils, making enzymatic transesterification an effective method.
