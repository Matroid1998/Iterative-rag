Description:
A metal oxide etched using thermal ALE.

Text:
Thermal 
ALE relies on temperature and thermochemically favourable reactions to remove surface 
species4 and etches at the same rate in all directions.5 Many technologically important 
metal oxides have been etched using thermal ALE including HfO2,69 ZrO2,6,9 SiO2,10 
Al2O3,9,1117 TiO2,18 VO2,19 WO3,20 ZnO,21 Ga2O3,22 as well as metal nitrides such as

Si3N4,23 AlN,24 TiN,25,26 and GaN.27,28 Thermal ALE of amorphous Al2O3 has also been 
reported using NbF5 to replace HF as the fluorination agent and CCl4 for the halide
exchange reaction.29 As well as fluorination and ligandexchange, thermal ALE can also 
be performed by other processes such as conversion,21 oxidation25 oxidationchlorination30 
and chlorinefluorine ligand exchange.31 Advantages of ALE include high uniformity, the 
ability to etch highaspectratio features, selectivity, and smoothing.32
