Description:
Analogous sources of ArSF4 radicals with applications in C(sp3)SF4Ar synthesis.

This contrasts 
with the relative accessibility of its ArSF4Cl congeners,5 which are analogous sources of ArSF4 radicals with applications in 
C(sp3)SF4Ar synthesis.6 
However, as part of a larger effort to make polyfluorinated groups more accessible in 2019,7 one of us disclosed the first 
userfriendly, gasreagent free synthesis of SF5Cl in the patent literature through oxidative fluorination of S8 using inexpensive 
trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA) and potassium fluoride.8 In 2021, Qing and coworkers reported an optimized workup 
protocol for this TCICAKF approach whereby SF5Cl can be extracted directly into hexanes to produce a storable stock 
solution, thus obviating the need to handle SF5Cl as a gas.9 Together, these recent advancements not only enable the broader 
chemical community to synthesize their own SF5Cl solution more safely, but facilitates the invention of pentafluorosulfanylation 
reactions and the study of heretofore unknown SF5containing motifs.10
