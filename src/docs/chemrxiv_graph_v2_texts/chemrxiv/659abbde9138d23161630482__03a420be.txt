Description:
Composite anodes that enhance cyclic stability, capacity retention, and rate performance.

The high electrical conductivity and mechanical stability 
exhibited by various carbon polymorphs has prompted extensive exploration of siliconcarbon 
composite anodes as a strategy for addressing the challenges associated with elemental silicon 
anodes, demonstrating notable enhancements in cyclic stability, capacity retention, and rate 
performance 10 11. Unfortunately, these composites frequently require costly and impractical 
syntheses, expensive binder materials, conductive additives and unsustainable carbon 
precursors 12. Additional, low overall silicon contents and not yet industriallevel stability in 
such anodes are notable issues. Due to these shortcomings, siliconcarbon composite anodes 
have yet to be widely implemented in commercial battery production. This being the case, this work proposes the first use of raw jellyfish biomass as a lowcost, 
sustainable, and ecofriendly carbon precursor for siliconcarbon composite anodes.
