Description:
Materials with surface terminations such as O, OH, F, and S.

Text:
The most
common surface terminations reported for MXenes are O, OH, F, and S. It is found that O and S terminated MXenes
have better electrochemical properties for battery applications relative to the OH and F functionalized MXenes. The
main advantage of Mn1XnSx MXenes over Mn1XnOx monolayers is that the former has lower diffusion barriers
than the latter 10, 11. It is reported that Ti2CS2 monolayers exhibit signicantly higher gravimetric capacity for Mg
compared to that of Ti2CO2 nanosheets 3.
