Description:
Compounds containing a nitrogen-carbon double bond with nitrogen attached to an aryl or alkyl group.

Examples include amides, ureas, thioureas, 
azomethines, and ethylene terephthalates.36 MLD is still in its infancy as compared to ALD, and 
therefore, relatively few elements other than C, N, O, and S have been incorporated in these thin 
films, leaving many paths open for investigation.1 

Emerging technologies such as highcapacity batteries and flexible microelectronic devices 
can leverage MLD films to solve problems that are preventing their widespread use and 
commercialization. Through formation of ultrathin, resilient, and flexible polymer networks, MLD 
will be a primary driver going forward.
