Description:
Undergoes photoisomerization governed by the microenvironment of opsin proteins in the first step of vision.

Text:
The environment around a molecule can have a pronounced effect on its excited state and is 
frequently used in nature to control and manipulate photophysical outcomes. One example is the 
first step of vision, where the photoisomerization of retinal is governed by the microenvironment of 
opsin proteins.1,2 Another example is the fluorophore of green fluorescent protein that is only 
emissive when packaged inside of the folded protein.3,4 Because photochemistry is a zerosum 
competition of the rates of different excited state processes, the manipulation of those rates by the 
environment can select which pathway is dominant.
