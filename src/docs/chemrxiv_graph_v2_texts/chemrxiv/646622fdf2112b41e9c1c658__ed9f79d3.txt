Description:
Exhibits a 2 oxidation state due to the stability of Ba(II) cations with a reduction potential of 2.91 V.

The chemistry of the alkaline earth (AE  MgBa) elements is classically dominated by the 2 
oxidation state, due to the stability of AE(II) cations. This arises from their closedshell 
configuration, and is further demonstrated by their large reduction potentials (AE20 Mg  
2.37 V; Ca  2.87 V; Sr  2.90 V; Ba  2.91 V).1 Consequently, classical AE(II) cations 
are considered redoxinert, thus posing a significant obstacle for catalytic applications where 
reversible oxidative and reductive steps are required. Molecular subvalent AE compounds 
were first reported by Jones and coworkers in 2007 with the landmark isolation of Mg(I) 
dimers (e.g.
