Description:
Offer much higher reactivity than nucleotide triphosphates and enable primer extension reactions.

Text:
One of the first successful examples of nonenzymatic RNA
selfreplication was demonstrated by Lohrmann and Orgel in
1980 16, in which they used guanosine5phosphoroimidazo
lides to synthesize oligoguanylic acids on the poly(C) tem
plate. Unlike nucleotide triphosphates, phosphoroimida
zolides proved to offer much higher reactivity and enabled the
socalled primer extension reaction with the catalytic support
of Pb2 and Zn2 cations 16. This process was improved
a year later by applying a more reactive 2methylimidazole
activating group instead of imidazole 17,18. However, this
improvement did not resolve the original challenge of copy
ing adenosine and uridine, which almost completely blocked
further RNA strand synthesis. Enzymefree replication of nu
cleic acids has been extensively studied by numerous groups
since then.

Description:
Used in nonenzymatic primer extension of nucleic acids on heterogeneous templates.

Text:
These efforts included further developments of
nonenzymatic primer extension of canonical and alternative
nucleic acids with phosphoroimidazolides on different hetero
geneous templates 1922 or immobilization of RNA 23 and
other or other forms of activation, like adenine derivatives 24. It included also various approaches to templated ligation
of RNA oligonucleotides, involving condensing agents and
organocatalysis 2528. The computational work presented
here focused on several variants of nonenzymatic template
copying involving phosphoroimidazolides, hence, we offer
more background on the associated scenarios below. The rate and fidelity of RNA selfreplication based on
nucleotide phosphoroimidazolides was further improved by
the consideration of short helper oligonucleotides, which
could bind downstream of the activated nucleotide monomers
which take part in the primer extension reaction 21,29.
