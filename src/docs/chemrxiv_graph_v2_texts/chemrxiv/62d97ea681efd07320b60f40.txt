Description:
A mechanophore that can undergo reversible ring opening.

Text:
Nearly all performance polymers experience mechanical stresses within their lifetime. Decades 
of research in polymer mechanochemistry1 have been targeted at studying manifestations of 
mechanical stress at the molecular level and revealed a plethora of stress induced molecular 
phenomena. A large fraction of this progress can be attributed to the use of mechanophores  
small forcesensitive molecules that are some of the most common molecular probes used for 
the investigation of stressinduced polymer transformations. A staple example of a 
mechanophore is the spiropyran (SP) probe that can undergo reversible ring opening, producing 
an intensely coloured luminescent merocyanine (MC) isomer (Figure 1).

Undergoes photoinduced, reversible ring opening to a colored luminescent merocyanine isomer.

Text:
Mechanically induced 
ring opening of SPs have been previously applied to study the deformation of various polymers, 
including PDMS,2 PMA3 and glassy PMMA4, and polycarbonates5, among other 
examples.6 Almost universally, SPMC isomerization allow for tracking the extent of bond 
scission upon application of external force or identical phenomena induced by physical 
swelling7 of polymer networks in the absence of external stresses. While the latter two are 
common types of extrinsic stresses known to bias mechanophore behaviour,8 this work aims 
at investigating the stresses that are intrinsic and common for the majority of polymers in their 
solid state  internal or residual stresses. Figure 1. Photoinduced and thermal isomerization of spiropyran. (A) Photoinduced, reversible 
ring opening of spiropyran (SP) to a colored luminescent merocyanine (MC) isomer.
