Synthetic chemicals known for their significant toxicity and persistence in the environment.

Per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used since the 1940s.1 Their 
31 
ubiquitous presence in the environment, significant toxicity, and persistence have raised growing 
32 
public concerns.2 Aqueous filmfoaming foam (AFFF) was identified as the major culprit 
33 
responsible for the elevated PFAS concentration in the receiving water and soil of manufacturing 
34 
sites, airports, and military fire training areas.35 
35 
The most urgently needed proactive solution to curb new PFAS contamination from using 
36 
AFFF is the disposal of the existing chemical stockpile.

Chemicals that are targeted for removal due to their structurally dependent reactivity.

The past investigations of PFAS defluorination were heavily invested in the treatment of model 
47 
PFAS, with only a few studies that used electrochemical oxidation, plasma, advanced oxidation, 
48 
and UVsulfite photoreduction to treat diluted AFFF with total fluorine (TF) ranging between 0.1
49 
27 mg FL.1317 All these technologies demonstrated structurally dependent reactivity in removing 
50 
target PFAS, and none achieved nearcomplete defluorination. To date, only hydrothermal alkaline 
51 
treatment realized 100 defluorination of AFFF but demands high temperature (170350C), 
52 
pressurized reactors (222 MPa), and alkaline addition (5 M of NaOH).18 
53 
Ball milling (BM) is an emerging technology for destroying PFAS chemicals at ambient 
54 
conditions.
