Description:
A unique family of nitrogen-rich aromatic fused tricyclic aza arenes with remarkable photocatalytic properties and efficient emitters for OLEDs.

Text:
Heptazines (see Scheme 1) are a unique family of nitrogenrich aromatic fused tricyclic aza
arenes. They are of interest because of their remarkable photocatalytic properties,17 but also 
because they have been shown to be efficient emitters for organic light emitting diodes 
(OLEDs).810 Their high electron deficiency situates them between triazines11 and tetrazines,12
14 the two most investigated classes of nitrogenrich heterocycles.

Description:
Polymeric materials consisting of heptazine monomers have been extensively studied as photocatalytically active materials.

Text:
Compared with these 
families, heptazines (Hz) received less attention in organic synthesis so far, despite a recent 
regain of interest in molecular Hz.1, 10, 1518 Various types of polymeric materials consisting of 
Hz momomers also have been extensively studied as photocatalytically active materials.5, 1921 

Scheme 1 Generic structure of trisubstituted heptazines (R, are substituents of various kinds) 

For many years, the search for efficient emitters for OLEDs was focussed on chromophores 
exhibiting the socalled reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the lowest triplet state to the 
lowest singlet state.2223 This kinetic process is possible if the energy gap EST  ES  ET is in the 
range of the thermal energy kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
