The spiroindimicins (SPMs) are a small family of dimeric tryptophan alkaloids isolated from 
various marine Streptomyces species (18, Figure 1).

Description:
Bear a central spirocyclic core constructed through Pd-catalyzed spirocyclization.

Text:
Their structures are characterized, as their name might 
suggest, by a spirocyclic indoline or indolenine motif, around which additional pyrrole and indole rings are 
structured, with at least one chlorine atom present in the naturally occurring members.1 Aside from 
representing rather unique topologies within the dimeric tryptophan alkaloids,2 these natural products were 
found to display moderate cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines.1 
Our group has recently developed an 
approach to the spiroindimicins bearing a 
central 56spirocyclic core, completing the 
first syntheses of spiroindimicin A (1) and its 
congener 
spiroindimicin 
H 
(5).3 
These 
syntheses relied on a key Pdcatalyzed 
spirocyclization 
to 
construct 
their 
core 
skeletons and small suite of analogues, 
screening of which revealed promising 
antiparasitic activity.

Description:
Spirocyclic compounds synthesized via early-stage construction of the spiroindoline.

Text:
In continuation of our 
interest in this family, we aimed to develop a 
concise route to the more prevalent 55
spirocyclic 
members 
(i.e., 
24, 
68), 
representing the remainder of the class. To date, two total syntheses of the 55spirocyclic spiroindimicins have been reported (Scheme 
1A).4 The first, by Sperry and Blair in 2015, provides access to racemic spiroindimicins B (2) and C (3) in 
1516 steps from commercial materials via earlystage construction of the spiroindoline via a Heck 
reaction, followed by installation of the remaining indole and pyrrole rings via Fisher indolization and 
SchllkopfMagnusBartonZard (SMBZ) reaction, respectively.5a Very recently, Xu et al.
