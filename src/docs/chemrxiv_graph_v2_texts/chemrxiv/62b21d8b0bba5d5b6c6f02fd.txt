Description:
A densely charged polyelectrolyte brush that promotes strong interactions with low isoelectric point proteins at neutral pH.

In 
many cases, the ability of brushes to modulate proteinsurface interactions and adsorption is 
associated with neutral brushes that do not promote strong interactions with other macromolecules. In 
contrast, 
densely 
charged 
polyelectrolyte 
brushes, 
such 
as 
those 
based 
on 
poly(dimethylaminoethyl 
methacrylate) 
(PDMAEMA) 
and 
poly(2
methacrylolyloxyethyltrimethylammonium iodide) (PMETAI), are expected to promote strong 
interactions, in particular with low isoelectric point proteins, at neutral pH1215, a useful property 
to maximise loading of surfaces with enzymes, for example. In addition, polycationic brushes have 
found application for gene delivery, owing to their ability to capture negatively charged DNA and 
RNA macromolecules 1618. Nanoparticles can be decorated with polycationic brushes that can capture genetic materials to be 
delivered upon internalisation, presenting different core chemistries for imaging or to control 
degradation 19, 20.
