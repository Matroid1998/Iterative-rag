Description:
Captured by selectively permeating membranes in membranebased DAC systems.

Text:
A variety of 
chemisorptionbased solid sorbents exist, such as amines grafted onto porous solids like silica, 
cellulose, or metalorganic frameworks (MOFs).2,3,6 Membranebased DAC (mDAC) captures 
CO2 by selectively allowing CO2 to permeate membranes while excluding other gases like nitrogen 
(N2).7 Torrefaction is another technique currently under development. It heats biomass to a 
temperature at which it chars, and the produced charred is subsequently buried.8 Bioenergy with 
integrated carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) also uses biomass, which is burnt to produce 
energy, and the produced CO2 is subsequently sequestered.9 Moisture swing adsorption uses 
anion exchange resins that captures CO2 while drying, and releases CO2 when remoistened.10 
Electrochemical CO2 capture is an emerging alternative to traditional DAC systems, bypassing 
temperature swings using electrical potentials.

Description:
A gas that can be adsorbed and desorbed through changes in oxidation state or pH.

Text:
Some of these approaches switch the oxidation state 
of redoxactive molecules for direct CO2 adsorption and desorption, while others are based on pH 
changes induced by redox reactions. The latter includes Direct Ocean Capture, which is an indirect 
form of carbon capture.11 It removes dissolved CO2 from seawater, which is then reabsorbed to 
the seawater from the air. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024xb82b ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000161704704 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
