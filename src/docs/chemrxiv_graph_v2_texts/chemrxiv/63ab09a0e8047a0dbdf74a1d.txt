Description:
Stronger adsorption occurs on terminal vanadyl groups acting as Lewis acid sites.

proposed that the increased concentration of Brnsted acid sites (VOH) on catalyst layer
by tungsten doping facilitates NH3 adsorption.4 On the other hand, more recent infrared
spectroscopic studies5,6 suggested that the terminal vanadyl groups, which act as Lewis acid
sites, are crucial for stronger ammonia adsorption. Indeed, in a previous theoretical study,7
we have shown that the addition of tungsten can lead to nonstoichiometric surfaces and the
occurrence of unsaturated terminal vanadyl groups.
