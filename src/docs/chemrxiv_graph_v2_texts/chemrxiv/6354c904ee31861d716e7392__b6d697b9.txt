Description:
A valuable hydrogenation product of vanillin.

Text:
The hydrogenation 
of vanillin as a lignin model has been a hot topic of research in the catalysis 
community.6 Vanillin has the potential to be upgraded to valueadded compounds by 
catalytic hydrogenation and its valuable hydrogenation products are typically vanillyl 
alcohol (VA) and 4methyl guaiacol (MMP). During the subsequent processing of bio
oils, thermally unstable compounds such as aldehydes, acids and sugars tend to cause 
catalyst coking and need to be converted to stable compounds (e.g.
