Description:
An amorphous polymer.

In addition, when atactic poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc) was 
complexed with U, it acted as a plasticizer and lowered the Tg of PVAc 10. Since PMMA, 
PVAc, and PVC are all amorphous polymers, we decided to conduct experiments to investigate 
whether U or any of its derivatives and related compounds could complex with PVC and lower 
its Tg. Urea (U) is used as a fertilizer for enhancing the yields of rice and other crops 12. Since 
it is absorbed by vegetation, and vegetables are consumed by humans, it seems safe to assume 
that U is an environmentally friendly substance. Also, U is used widely in coatings for pools, 
water parks, and cables.
