Description:
Used in protein engineering to increase the apparent melting temperature and activity of HheG variants.

Thus, crystal structures for 
members of almost all currently known HHDH subtypes AG have been reported by now.13,40
44 One of them is HheG from Ilumatobacter coccineus.42 This enzyme was the first reported 
HHDH displaying unexpectedly high activity on cyclic as well as other sterically demanding 
internal epoxide substrates, owing to its much broader and more solventexposed active site 
compared to other HHDHs.42,4547 Since its discovery in 2017, a few more Gtype HHDHs have 
been characterized, all displaying similar substrate scopes as HheG.13,47,48 Despite this 
appealing activity towards bulky epoxides, HheG as well as other Gtype members also come 
with some limitations including their insufficient stability for industrial application as well as 
an only moderate enantioselectivity.37,42,47 The first challenge, the poor (thermal) stability of 
HheG, was already addressed by us through protein engineering as well as 
immobilization.37,49,50 Thus, we could demonstrate that the exchange of residue T123 in HheG 
by aromatic amino acids or glycine resulted in variants with up to 14 K higher apparent melting 
temperature as well as increased activity, most likely through regulating the dynamics of an N
terminal loop spanning residues 3947 (Figure 1B).37 Interestingly, a slight increase in the 
enantioselectivity of those HheG variants was observed as well.
