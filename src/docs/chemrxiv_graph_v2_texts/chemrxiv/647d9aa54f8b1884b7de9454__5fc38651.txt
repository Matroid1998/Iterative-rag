Participates in peptide bond formation with an amino acid.

peptide bond formation between an 
amino acid ester and an amino acid.2022 This was exploited to 
drive vesicle growth via SerHis localising inside the membrane 
of vesicles and catalysing the formation of a hydrophobic di
peptide.23 SerHis can catalyse the formation of oligonucleo
tides starting from imidazoleactivated nucleotides.24 Histidyl 
containing cyclic peptides catalyse also the hydrolysis of pyro
phosphate.25 Histidine may also ligate metals e.g. Zn2 to form 
complexes that catalyse depsipeptide oligomerisation.26 In our 
aforementioned physicochemical orthophosphate cycle, we hy
pothesized that a histidyl peptide could serve as a catalyst for
