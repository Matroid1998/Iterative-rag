The driving key factor in engineering and thus in chemical engineering lies in the adaption of 
2 
conventional knowledge to unconventional environments. Ideas can cook and ripe in this melting pot of 
3 
ideas. A great unconventional area is applications beyond earth where technical ideas can emerge. We 
4 
would be delighted if you could look at the article from this perspective and then confirm that polymer 
5 
reactors are an answer that has so far gone unnoticed to the question What construction material can be 
6 
used in catalysis when metals are not suitable? 7 
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and related compounds are thermoplastics and therefore in general 
8 
suitable for processing via additive manufacturing for applications in space 1.
