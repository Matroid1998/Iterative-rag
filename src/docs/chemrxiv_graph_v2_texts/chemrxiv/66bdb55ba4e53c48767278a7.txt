Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have rapidly attracted significant scientific attention due to their photo
physical and optoelectronic properties.13 They have high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), a 
narrow emission width, a widely tunable bandgap and emission wavelength in the visible range, high 
chargecarrier mobility, and a long diffusion length.48 MHPs also have the advantage of being simple to 
manufacture, which has led to their use in numerous fields, including photovoltaics9,10, 
photodetectors11,12, lightemitting diodes13,14, lasers15,16, solartofuel energy conversion systems17 and 
ionizing radiation detectors.18 
Among the family of MHP NCs, CsPbBr3 NCs are wellknown for their distinctive features. These include 
lowtemperature processability, relative stability at room temperature in air, and a highly emissive 
crystalline phase.
