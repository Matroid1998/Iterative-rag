Description:
Toxic acids that are of environmental concern.

1 
Carboxylic acids play an essential role in petroleum chemistry.14 Due to their amphiphilic nature, 
2 
carboxylic acids in are surface active and contribute to the interfacial behavior and stability of wateroil 
3 
emulsion systems, which is critical in production systems.5, 6 The acidic fractions are associated with 
4 
catalyst poisoning and corrosion of equipment and pipelines, leading to problems in production and 
5 
refining.7, 8 However, carboxylic molecules are also valuable markers providing important information 
6 
about the migration, maturation, and degradation of petroleum. Furthermore, due to their toxicity, 
7 
aromatic and naphthenic acids are of environmental concern.911 
8 
A detailed characterization of carboxylic acids in crude oil is therefore desirable but remains a significant 
9 
challenge.
