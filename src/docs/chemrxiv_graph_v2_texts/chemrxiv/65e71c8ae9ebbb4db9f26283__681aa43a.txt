Description:
Porous materials used as adsorbents for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2.

Text:
Solid adsorbents, in contrast to liquid absorbents, offer 
advantages such as lower energy requirements for 
regeneration, modularity, and mitigation of corrosion and 
evaporation challenges.3, 4 Many promising adsorbents 
have been proposed for DAC to date, including metal
organic frameworks,57 zeolites,8, 9 and supported amine 
materials.3, 4, 10, 11 
The 
primary 
challenge 
for 
widescale 
DAC 
implementation is not whether sorbents can effectively 
remove CO2 from the air, as operational DAC plants 
currently exist.12, 13 Instead, the most significant hurdle is 
the economic viability of DAC. In contrast to post
combustion CO2 capture processes, in which revenue for 
the CO2 emitter is still possible, DAC lacks an intrinsic 
revenue source.
