Description:
A carbon-based nanomaterial known for its extraordinary physical and chemical properties.

Text:
The field of nanoscience and nanotechnology has drawn extensive attention in the last decades 
due to the extraordinary physical and chemical properties of different materials in the nanoscale. The synthesis and development of nanomaterials and heterostructures of them is on high demand 
due their practical application at the academic and industrial level.1,2 There are several types of 
nanomaterials, classified according to their dimensionality (from 0 to 2D) and their components 
(metalbased, semiconductors, nanocomposites, etc). One of the most common families of 
nanomaterials are the carbonbased nanomaterials,3 with graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNT) or 
fullerenes as relevant examples.
