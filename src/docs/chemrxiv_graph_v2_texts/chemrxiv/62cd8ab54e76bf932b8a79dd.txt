Description:
Increased dissolution at the liquid Cu surface is a possible aspect affecting synthesis quality.

Text:
The recent discovery of rapid and highquality synthesis of Gr at liquid Cu catalysts was an 
important finding towards largescale commercialization. 1, 2 At present though, there is little

mechanistic understanding of what precisely leads to the improved Gr quality as compared to the 
more traditional synthesis on solid Cu catalysts, which typically employs highly comparable 
growth conditions just at 100 K lower temperature. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The absence of extended 
defects, generally higher mobility of atoms, clusters, and flakes, or an increased carbon 
dissolution at the liquid Cu surface are but a few possible aspects that immediately come to mind.
