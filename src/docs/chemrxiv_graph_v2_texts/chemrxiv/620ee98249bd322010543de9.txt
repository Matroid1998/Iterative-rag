Description:
A photoswitching tool for manipulating physical and optical properties of materials and controlling protein functions.

Text:
Reversible EZ and ZE isomerisations of azobenzenes can be ef
fected with UVvisible light1, as well as with redox reactions follow
ing photocatalysis2, electrocatalysis3, or Xray illumination4. The 
high spatiotemporal precision, noninvasiveness, and rapidity with 
which bulk populations of azobenzenes can be photoisomerised in 
both EZ and ZE directions has made azobenzene photoswitching 
a powerful tool for manipulating the physical and optical properties 
of solid materials5, the electronic and dynamic properties of soft mat
ter6, and for controlling protein functions and downstream cascades 
in biochemistry, cell biology, and in adult animals.712 
Azobenzene photoresponse and isomerisation completeness are 
critical for all these applications. Alkylazobenzenes respond effi
ciently to light only up to ca. 500 nm.

Several azobenzene substitution patterns have been developed to 
tune the isomers spectra, and thus the photoresponsiveness and 
completion of photoisomerisations.15 Tetraorthosubstitutions par
ticularly improve photoswitch performance, without necessarily 
compromising function (as most azobenzene photopharmaceuticals 
are azoextension or azolinker designs16 where only the 4,4 po
sitions determine bioactivity).1720 Hechts tetraorthofluoro pattern 
gives excellent EZ isomerisation at 500 nm and ZE at 400 nm.21 
Woolleys sterically congested tetraorthomethoxy,22 thioalkyl23, 
and chloro24 azobenzenes improved on older tetraorthoalkyl azo
benzenes,25,26 with still better EZ isomerisation at 550 nm (for good 
biocompatibility and depth penetration) making them alluring for 
photopharmacology in vivo;12 ZE isomerisation is most complete at 
400 nm (see Supporting Note 1).21,22 However, most tetraortho 
syntheses are inflexible, needing orthosubstituents to be introduced 
early and carried through synthesis;24,27 the only exhaustive latestage 
orthoderivatisation reported is tetraorthochlorination (Fig 1a).20
