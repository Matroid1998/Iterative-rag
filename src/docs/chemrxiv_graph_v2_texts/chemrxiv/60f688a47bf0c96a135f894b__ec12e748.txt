Description:
Serves as a solvent in basic solutions for solvothermal reactions.

Text:
The result is often the synthesis of metastable kinetic products of high symmetry, 
with slow cooling enabling pristine crystal growth directly from the reaction mixture.10 
Results and Discussion The solvothermal reaction of FeCl3, Fe(ClO4)36H2O and teaH3 
(triethanolamine) in a basic MeOH solution results in the formation of redbrown crystals upon cooling 
(see the experimental section in the SI for full details). Crystals of FeIII15O6(tea)8Cl6(ClO4)3 (1, Fig. 1, 
S1; Table S1) were found to be in a trigonal crystal system, and structure solution was performed in 
the R3 space group (see the crystallographic section in the SI for full details). The metallic skeleton of 
1 describes a centred tetrakis hexahedron (Fig. 2), a Catalan solid which is the dual of the truncated 
octahedron, an Archimedean solid.
