Description:
Used in plasma activation to remove surface contaminants and enhance zincophilicity on carbon fiber.

Text:
In Figure 2a, 
without plasma activation, the Zn(NO3)2 and 2MeIm fails to 
fully infiltrate the carbon fiber, resulting in incomplete cover
age and agglomeration of ZIF8 particles (Figure 2b). However, 
upon activation by oxygen plasma, surface contaminants are re
moved, and oxygen functional groups are uniformly distributed 
on the carbon fiber surface, enhancing zincophilicity.28 As a re
sult, Zn(NO3)2 and 2MeIm can fully infiltrate the carbon fiber 
(Figure 2c), enabling tight and homogeneous growth of ZIF8 
particles on the carbon fiber surface (Figure 2d). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024t0h0z ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000268855246 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
