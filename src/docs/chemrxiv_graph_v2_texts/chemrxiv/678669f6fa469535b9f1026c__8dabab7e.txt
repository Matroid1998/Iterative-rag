Description:
An intermetallic phase reported in Li-containing Mg alloys of the AZ series.

Despite numerous advantages, the high reactivity and low corrosion resistance of 
72 
magnesium alloys limit their practical applications 15,16. The main factors affecting the 
73 
corrosion susceptibility of Mg alloys are local galvanic corrosion due to galvanic coupling between 
74 
the alloys matrix and IMPs and the low protective ability of a surface oxide film (the Pilling
75 
Bedworth ratio is 0.81) formed of the surface 4,17. 76 
For Licontaining Mg alloys of the AZseries, several types of IMPs were reported in the 
77 
literature Mg17Al12, MgxMey, and AlzMew ( are Li, Mn, Zn) 18.
