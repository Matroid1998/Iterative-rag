Description:
A quantum functional group suitable for laser cooling.

Text:
The CaO group can function as an OCC because it supplies the molecule with an access to
an electronically excited state that spontaneously decays almost exclusively to the molecular
(electronic and vibrational) ground state5057. Other quantum functional groups suitable for
laser cooling, such as SrO and YbO, have also been identified5787. FIG. 1
Molecules studied in this work. Counterclockwise from the left top CaOH, azobenzene
(AB), paraCaOazobenzene (pAB), and bis(paraCaO)azobenzene (bpAB). Onethusfar only hypothesized but excitingpossibility is to use quantum functional
groups, such as CaO OCCs, for precise optical sensing of chemical events.
