Description:
A component with high electron affinity used in the active layer of organic solar cells to surpass exciton binding energy and establish bulk heterojunctions.

As a result, the photogenerated 
charge carriers sustain a strong Columbic interaction, which leads to significant geminate 
recombination losses in organic solar cells (OSCs).1,2 In OSCs, a second component with high 
electron affinity such as fullerene is incorporated into the active layer to surpass the exciton 
binding energy and establish bulk heterojunction (BHJ) between donor and acceptor.3,4 
Although, the concept of BHJ has been continuously evolved and witnessed a record power 
conversion efficiency (PCE) of  18 for single junction solar cells, the main disadvantage of 
BHJ is the morphology domains of donor and acceptor dictates the PCE of device.5,6 The 
morphology of donoracceptor blend is very sensitive to the numerous parameters such as 
molecular structure of donor and acceptor, processing solvent, annealing temperature of thin 
film, spincoating conditions and solvent additives.7,8 To explore the full potential of any 
newly synthesized polymer donor materials or small molecule acceptor, this ponderous 
process needs to be optimized.9,10 Despite these tedious efforts, phase separation of donor 
and acceptor domains is not limited to exciton diffusion length due to inherent 
thermodynamic instability of the blend.11,12 The difference in tendency of crystallization of 
donor and acceptor drive them to form microscopic domains larger than exciton diffusion 
length.1315 These microscopic domains evolve further with the time and leads to spinodal 
decomposition of blend, resulting in shorter lifetime of OSCs.8,12,15 
Furthermore, the stringent energy criteria to accomplish efficient exciton dissociation 
through electronhole transfer at the donoracceptor interface leads to loss in energy.
