However, a recently developed 
method for the synthesis of Pt NCs under atmospheric conditions 
using CO and phosphines (PR3) or thiolates (SR) as ligands 
(Ptn(CO)m(PR3)l or Ptn(CO)m(SR)o NCs, respectively) has emerged as a 
simple and convenient way to generate such NCs in large quantities.7

In particular, Pt17(CO)12(PPh3)8z (z  1 or 2; PPh3  
triphenylphosphine; Fig. 1a) represents a unique form of Pt NCs 
that can be synthesized under atmospheric conditions and 
exhibit remarkable stability. These NCs not only are structurally 
distinct but also serve as highly effective precursors of catalysts 
for reactions, including CO oxidation, propylene oxidation, and 
oxygen reduction.8,11,13 Their robust catalytic activity highlights 
their potential, making them invaluable in the development of 
highperformance catalysts for various fields. However, the
