Description:
Amphiphilic groups that attach to surfaces.

Text:
The initial layer, formed directly adjacent to the surface, attaches 
57 
primarily through hydrophilic (e.g., carboxylates) or amphiphilic (e.g., amines and amides) 
58 
groups. Once this foundational layer is established, it serves as a platform for more hydrophobic, 
59 
less polar organic molecules to adsorb, building up additional layers of organic matter.40, 41 
60 
Additionally, DOM attachment to mineral surfaces may occur in a nonuniform manner due to 
61 
changes in interfacial energies and surface topology. This process often mirrors characteristics of 
62 
partial wetting phenomena.31 In both sorption scenarios, the interfacial interactions are governed 
63 
by the hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic nature of the organic molecules, leading to 
64 
complex sorption behavior and multilayer formation under varying environmental conditions.
