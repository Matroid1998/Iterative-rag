Description:
A metastable ternary material where the cubic rock salt structure of TiN is preserved while varying Al content.

Text:
AlN is one example of such a material 
used in microelectronic and optoelectronic applications because of its wide bandgap (6.2 eV)5, 
high dielectric constant (9)6, high electrical resistivity (10111013 cm)7, a good thermal 
conductivity (2.85 WKcm)8 and piezoelectric properties9. AlN also has good miscibility with other nitrides, making it interesting to many ternary 
materials with e.g., Ga10, In11, Ti12 or Hf13, thereby increasing the range of its possible 
applications. One such ternary material is metastable AlxTi1xN where the cubic rock salt 
structure of TiN is preserved while varying Al content. AlxTi1xN primarily finds use as a hard 
material in protective coatings, often on cemented carbide tool inserts due to its excellent 
resistance against corrosion and oxidation, and high hardness.1416 These properties can be 
tuned with the chemical composition.
