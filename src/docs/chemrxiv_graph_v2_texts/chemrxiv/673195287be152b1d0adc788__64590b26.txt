Description:
Obtained from methanol.

The examples of products synthesized via this approach are 
represented by chemical commodities, such as acetaldehyde4,5,6,7,8 or 2,3butandiol9,10,11,6 that are 
obtained upon dehydrogenation of ethanol, ethylene glycol  from methanol,12,13,14,15 and other 
organic compounds.16,17,18 It is worth to mention that the demand for such fine organic compounds is 
significantly lower compared to the above mentioned industrial commodities. Given that H2 and 
organic compounds are generated in stoichiometric, 11, ratio, various oxidantfree cross
dehydrogenative coupling19 and crosscoupling hydrogen evolution reactions20 cannot, in principle, 
fulfil all the demand in H2.
