Description:
Emissions from gold mining that contribute to environmental damage.

. Gold has been a part of human culture for millennia where it 
has served as currency and a medium for art and jewelry (1, 2). In modern times, gold has 
found widespread technological use in electronics (3), aerospace applications (4), material 
science (5), biomedical science (6) and chemical synthesis (7). Unfortunately, gold mining 
comes with an environmental cost, with deforestation, CO2 emissions, and heavy metal 
pollution damaging sensitive ecosystems (Fig. 1A) (8, 9). Furthermore, acutely toxic 
substances such as cyanide lixiviants are used to produce more than 80 of gold (10, 11). While regulated and widely used in largescale mining, the risk of hazardous exposure and 
breach of cyanidecontaining tailings dams remains a risk (11).
