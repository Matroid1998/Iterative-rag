Description:
Involved in carbon capture processes using temperature swing adsorption.

Text:
For many applications, the thermal properties of the materials also play a role in their
performance.811 For example, the energy penalty of a carbon capture process using a tem
perature swing adsorption process (TSA), where the adsorbent material is regenerated by
heating the adsorption bed, is directly inuenced by the heat capacity of the adsorbent ma
terial.12 Often, it is assumed that the heat capacity is a constant for all materials in these
energy penalty calculations.1315 However, there is little foundation for this assumption, and
