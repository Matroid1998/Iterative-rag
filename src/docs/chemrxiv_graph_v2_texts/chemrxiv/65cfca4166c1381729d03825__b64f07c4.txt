Description:
Isotopes such as HT and D2 have molecular masses close to 4.0239 and 4.0282, respectively.

Text:
The individual detection of the isotopes of hydrogen
and helium requires a mass resolution of over 1000 because
the molecular masses of HT, D2, and 4He are quite close with
each other (mz  4.0239, 4.0282, and 4.0026, respectively).4
One such instrument, an omegatron ICR mass spectrometer,
has been in use at the Alcator CMod tokamak magnetic fu
sion device for sampling the plasma.7,8 An ultrahigh resolu
tion quadrapole mass spectrometer, the Hiden DLS20 (Hiden
Analytical Ltd., Warrington, Cheshire, UK) has been specif
ically designed for the analysis of lowmass isotopes during
the deuteriumtritium campaign at the Joint European Torus
(JET).9 A similar quadrapole mass spectrometry method has
been used at the DIIID26, EAST and the HT7 tokamaks.10,11
Especially in the field of Low Energy Nuclear Reactions
(LENR), helium detection is used as a diagnostic method to
determine if a result can be attributed to known nuclear pro
cesses.
