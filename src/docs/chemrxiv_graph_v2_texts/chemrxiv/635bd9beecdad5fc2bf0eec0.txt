Description:
A major cause of global warming and pollution released by burning hydrocarbons.

Energy consumption has always been ever increasing in the world due to rising energy 
demands. The world currently uses carbonemitting fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) to power 
approximately 90 of transportation, 65 of electricity generation and 75 of industrial 
energy consumption. Burning hydrocarbon releases carbon dioxide, a major cause of global 
warming and pollution. Pollution control and environmental protection have become a 
worldwide issue of concern. Although these hydrocarbons are a predominant combustible fuel 
source, they are persistent pollutants for the ecosystem. These components threaten all life 
forms ranging from microorganism to humans when they are released in the environment via 
human activities. Thus, theres a dire urgency to set up an energy equation without hydrocarbon 
fuels. The world is looking for sustainable solutions to its energy needs.
