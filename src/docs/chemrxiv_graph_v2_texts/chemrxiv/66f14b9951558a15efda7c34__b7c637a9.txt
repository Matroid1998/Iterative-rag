Description:
A bidentate ligand used in coordination chemistry.

of a bidentate ligand into PNCcH2OCovTPP. This was readily achieved by adding 
4,4bipyridyl into the methanol solvent in contact with the crystals with 100 incorporation of the 
walltie ligands into the cavity to give PNCvTPPCocbipyCovTPP as confirmed by scXRD. Removal of included solvent from these crystals to give did not result in loss of order and only a slight 
reduction in unit cell volume (0.4). Nitrogen adsorption analysis at 77K of PUNCvTPPCocbipy
CovTPP showed significant uptake at low relative pressure to give a typical Type 1 isotherm shape 
consistent with a microporous material (Fig. 5a). This data was used to calculate a BrunauerEmmett
Teller surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g1.
