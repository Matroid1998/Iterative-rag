Description:
A molecule used in linear vibronic coupling models.

Text:
Specically, we perform simulations using the
coupledtrajectory mixed quantumclassical (CTMQC)
algorithm3638, which can be viewed as the coupled
trajectory version of the traditional multitrajectory
Ehrenfest (MTE) approach21,
and using the (com
bined)39 coupledtrajectory Tully surface hopping40,41
((C)CTTSH), which can be viewed as the coupled
trajectory version of the traditional Tully surface hop
ping (TSH)20. We employ as case studies the full
dimensional linear vibronic coupling (LVC) models4244
recently developed by Worth and coworkers for the
molecules 4(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) and
fulvene, which have been proposed by Ibele and Curchod
as molecular Tully models in Ref. 45. The use of analytical LVC models allows us to fo
