Description:
A 0D analog that is a good electron acceptor and can be used as a building block to develop 3D analogs.

A class of 1Dgraphene, carbon nano
tubes49,50 and cylindrical analogs,51 has also been investigated for 
electrochemical and catalysis applications owing to their high 
electrical conductivity.52 
A challenging aspect is the synthesis of the corresponding 3D 
graphene materials5355 from a 2D scaffold.13 Reducing the di
mension of 2D graphene can be used to develop 3D graphene; 
the 0D analog of the fullerene family,56 a good electron accep
tor,57 can be used as a building block to develop 3Danalogs.58 
Catalytic carbonization has also been successfully applied to pre
pare 3D graphene architecture.23,29,59 However, the precise syn
thesis of 3Dordered graphene materials with welldefined neg
ativelycurved 3D networks60,61 remains an emerging topic since 
British scientists predicted imaginary carbon frameworks with 8
membered rings in hexagons to achieve a 3D structure with low 
strain.53 These materials are highly symmetric and possess 
highly ordered nanostructures that provide various fascinating 
functions (vide infra).
