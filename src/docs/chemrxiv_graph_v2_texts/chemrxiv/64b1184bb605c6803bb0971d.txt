A gas that is partially removed from flue gas in post-combustion capture plants.

combustion capture plants will remove only 8595 of CO2 from the flue gas, with the 
higher end of that range considered the bestavailable technology 6 and 90 adopted 
as standard regardless of the technology type 7. Notably, an increase in the design CO2 
capture rate for the solventbased chemical scrubbing technology from 90 to 95 
would increase the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 3. A further increase to 99 
was shown to increase the LCOE by up to 7.4. Consequently, most process designs 
will consider 90 as the target CO2 capture level; thus, the entire process will remain a 
net carbon emitter.
