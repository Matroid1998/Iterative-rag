Description:
Can plate on graphite anodes, contributing to degradation and battery failure.

Text:
One of the identified XFC failure pathways is graphite anode degradation, which includes Li 
plating, loss of interparticle connectivity, and delamination of anode from the current collector.4
8 Investigating the origins and characteristics of anode degradation spatially in three dimensions 
(3D) is imperative to understand its role in capacity fade and battery failure. Numerous methods 
have studied graphite anode degradation in LIBs.9 These include electrochemical methods,1011 
spectroscopic methods,12 optical imagingmicroscopy,13 scanning electron microscopy,1415 focused 
ion beamscanning electron microscopy,16 transmission electron microscopy,1718 scanning probe
