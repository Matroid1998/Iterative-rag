Description:
Used as an additive in electrodes to influence energy density, power density, durability, and safety.

Text:
Such 
microstructure, characterized by the spatial location of the active material (AM) particles, the 
carbon additives, the binder and the pore network, determine the practical properties of the 
electrode and the cell, such as their energy density, power density, durability and safety.15 In 
turn, the electrode microstructure is determined by its manufacturing process.
