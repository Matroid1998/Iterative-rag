Description:
A structural unit found in natural and synthetic organic molecules with applications in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and polymers.

The amide or thioamide bond is undoubtedly amongst the 
most widespread1 structural units found in natural and synthet
ic organic molecules with various applications in the pharma
ceutical, agrochemical, and polymer industrial sectors.2 The 
advancement of more valuable methods for creating amides3 
has been considered one of the top targets for synthetic organ
ic chemists. Traditional methods for amide (via CN) bond 
formation 4 use acid derivatives and nucleophilic amines. The 
recent trend of making amides is the metalcatalyzed ami
dation via CC bond formation.5 The reduction of het
eroallenes such as carbodiimide (CDI)s, isocyanates, and 
isothiocyanates into formamidines,6 formamides,3a, 7 and thi
oformamide3a, 8 using stoichiometric metal reagents, has been 
established in the literature (Figure 1, A).
