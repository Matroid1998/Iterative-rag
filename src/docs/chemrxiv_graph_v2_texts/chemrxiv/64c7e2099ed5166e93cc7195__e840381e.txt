Description:
A greenhouse gas produced during the reduction of iron oxide ores in blast furnaces.

Ironmaking processes that do not generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are needed 
for netzeroemissions energy systems (1). Most emissions associated with iron and steel production result 
from stochiometric quantities of CO2 (1.5 kg CO2 per kg Fe) produced during reduction of iron oxide 
ores in blast furnaces (2, 3). Demand for steel is unlikely to decrease during decarbonization (4); immense 
quantities of iron and steel are needed for manufacturing electric vehicles, buildings with electrified 
heatingcooling systems (5), racking for solar panels, supports for wind turbines, and devices for grid scale 
energy storage (6). Today, steelmaking is responsible for 8 of global GHG emissions, comparable to all 
passenger vehicles combined (7).
