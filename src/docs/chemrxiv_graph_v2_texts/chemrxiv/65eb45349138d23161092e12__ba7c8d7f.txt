Description:
A weak base with good activating properties.

Text:
This material is already regularly used to partially replace 
37 
clinker in cements4 and is consequently interesting in itself but it also represents a good model 
38 
for all alkaliactivated cements formulations based on Capoor glasses of low hydraulicity. 39 
Regarding the activators, the most promising ones appear to be sodium hydroxide  a strong 
40 
base, sodium carbonate  a weak base, and sodium silicate, as they can be easily supplied and 
41 
have good activating properties4. 42 
During the hydration reaction of alkaliactivated slag cements, hydrates, different from 
43 
those found in more traditional cements and following a different sequence, are formed. This 
44 
has been reviewed in numerous textbooks4,5 and articles,6,7 and is still the subject of active 
45 
research.

Description:
An activator that results in more crosslinked gels compared to NaOH.

As for OPC, the primary hydration product which is formed is an Aluminuminserted
47 
CalciumSilicateHydrate, CASH, phase gel811. The structure of the CASH formed 
48 
depends on the slag composition but mostly on the activator used. For example, the NaOH
49 
activation usually leads to a more crystalline gel with a higher Al incorporation than with 
50 
sodium silicates1215. Furthermore, more crosslinked gels are observed when sodium 
51 
silicates or sodium carbonate are used as activators than when NaOH is used15. Fernndez
52 
Jimnez et al.15 also found longer linear chains in the CASH precipitated in presence of 
53 
NaOH. Moreover, in the case of low Caenvironments, another type of aluminosilicate gel can 
54 
form, the NASH gel6.
