Description:
Forms liposomes that are more tolerant of pH changes and metal ions.

In work on the emergence of amino 
alcohol bearing phospholipids, our group13 described a general 
prebiotic synthesis and hydrolysis scheme that selects for natu
ral phospholipid headgroups comprising G1P over those com
prising G2P. Then, in work advancing the prebiotic chemistry 
of cyclophospholipids, Krishnamurthy and coworkers14 
showed that liposomes formed of glycerol monodecanoate and 
phospholipid comprising G1P are more tolerant of pH changes 
and metal ions, such as those required for prebiotic RNA 
chemistry,15 than those made with phospholipid comprising 
G2P. These studies raise further questions, particularly in light of 
the systems chemistry approach in which mixtures of reactants 
or products must be considered and their properties compared.
