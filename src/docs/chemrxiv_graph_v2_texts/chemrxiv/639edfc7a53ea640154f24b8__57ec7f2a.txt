Description:
Subject to electrochemical topochemical reduction within a solid-state FIB.

Text:
Although carbon is typically considered an inert 
additive, recent work uncovered the unexpected oxidation of carbon, as identified via XPS 
measurements that showed the shift in carbon to higher binding energies.5f Unwanted side 
reactions can also be observed under reducing conditions. Wissel et al.6 studied the 
electrochemical topochemical reduction of La2NiO3F2 7 within a solidstate FIB, attempting to 
form partially defluorinated La2NiO3F1.93 and La2NiO3F, both of which require reduction of Ni2 
to Ni. Remarkably, they observed only the formation of La2NiO3F1.93, even though the charging 
plateau exceeded the theoretical capacity for forming La2NiO3F by a factor of four. XPS
