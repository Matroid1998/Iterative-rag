Description:
Structure type formed at relatively low temperature with shorter reaction time.

Kohlmann and Ritter had performed systematic experimental 
investigations using neutron powder diffraction and confirmed the atomic distributions 
of In and Pd (belonging to close Xray scattering factors) in the three different structure 
types of InPd3 13. According to their report, the reaction conditions play an important 
role in determining the structure type. Long annealing time at high temperature (T  800 
K) leads to the ZrAl3 structure type (I4mmm (no. 139); a  406.196(5) pm, c  
1520.31(2) pm, Z 4). Shorter reaction time at relatively low temperature (T  750 K) 
leads to the TiAl3 structure type (I4mmm (no. 139), a  409.96(2) pm, c  747.59(5)
