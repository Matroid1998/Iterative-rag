Description:
A key element involved in global emissions and climate change.

Text:
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology that captures CO2 
from point sources, such as power plants and industrial facilities, followed by sequestration 7. Although CCS has the potential for globalscale deployment, its actual implementation has been 
slower than expected 7,8. However, it continues to be a crucial part of the plan to reduce the 
impact of climate change and meet emission reduction goals 5. This highlights the significance 
of ongoing research, development, and implementation of CCS to tackle global carbon emissions. Various technologies have been developed for a wide range of CCS applications. Among these, 
the sorptionbased method, often utilizing an amine absorbent, has received the most attention 
911. This twostep process involves an amine scrubbing tower followed by a thermally driven 
amine regeneration step.

Description:
An electrophilic site in CO2 that can be selectively captured.

Text:
For 
instance, EGNs rely on the generation of nucleophilic sites on a redoxactive molecule (e.g., 
quinone, Q) via reduction to initiate the selective capture of CO2 from its electrophilic carbon site. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024c25fk ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000344436239 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
