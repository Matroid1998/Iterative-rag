Description:
A nucleus targeting ligand used in fluorescent probes for visualizing subcellular organelles.

Text:
The prodigious development in the field of fluorescent probes and imaging techniques has 
enabled researchers to visualize specific subcellular organelles and characteristic cellular 
processes in living cells.1 Among the various organelles, the nucleus stocks all the genetic 
material and controls most of the cellular events comprising DNA replication, mRNA synthesis 
and processing. 2 Most nucleus targeting sensors have been designed by incorporating nucleus
targeting ligands, like Hoechst or peptides,3 but even slight structural modifications lower their 
targeting ability drastically and thus require longer incubation times for localizing. Existing 
methods for monitoring mitotic division often involve cell fixation or genetic engineering of 
fluorescent cellcycle reporters,4 which is a tedious process, requires skilled professionals and 
thus limits their applicability for realtime studies of live cells.
