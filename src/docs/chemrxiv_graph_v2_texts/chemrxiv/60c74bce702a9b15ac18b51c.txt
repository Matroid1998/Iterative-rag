Description:
A commonly found perfluorinated compound in surface waters.

Text:
The most commonly found PFCs in surface waters 
are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS).2 Surprisingly, thus far, 
there is no mutually agreed international drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS, but the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency have recommended a strict combined 
concentration limit of 70 ngL.3 Recent analysis of global water samples even revealed 
concentrations exceeding the provisional threshold.49 

Although most fluorochemical manufacturers have ceased their production of PFOA and PFOS 
in the early 2000s, this measure does not address the legacy pollution caused by these compounds.
