Description:
Exhibits low-temperature phosphorescence with multistate emission.

Text:
An early comparison of 
C70 and corannulene lowtemperature phosphorescence (LTP) suggested multistate emission,32 an 
uncommon violation of Kashas rule. Previous reports demonstrate that mono through pentakis
acetylenebridged derivatives revealed the high photoluminescence quantum yields, FPL, and various 
colors of corannulene fluorescence were possible.17, 1922 These ethynyl and arylsubstituted 
corannulene derivatives are all fluorescent, thus are not adept at harvesting triplet excitons and so less 
relevant materials for electroluminescent devices. In 2018, Hatakeyama et al. reported a extended 
B2N2embedded corannulene derivative (PL424 nm; PL69 in CH2Cl2) and the first reported 
example of a corannulenebased organic lightemitting diode (OLED), which showed a maximum 
external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.61.25, 33 A growing database of crystal structures of 
corannulene derivatives showed that quasicolumnar packings, also in polar space groups, were 
possible.
