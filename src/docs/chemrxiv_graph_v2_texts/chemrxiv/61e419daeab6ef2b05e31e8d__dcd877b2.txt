Description:
Used as a monomer to build PPIs.

Text:
The PPIs were synthesized via acetic acid catalyzed Schiff base reaction in the mixed 
solvents (see Supporting Information). pmphenylenediamine (PDAMDA) and pm
phthalaldehyde (PAHMAH) were selected as the monomers to build the PPIs, and three 
copolymers were referred to as PDAPAH, PDAMAH, and MDAMAH, respectively (Figure 
S1). As shown in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure S2), the identical 
bands of the three PPIs samples at 1640 cm1 clearly demonstrated that the imine (CN) 
bonds had formed by the Schiffbase condensation. The formation of CN bonds was 
further confirmed by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as N1s peaked at around 
398.8 eV in all the spectra (Figure S3 and S4).
