Description:
Highly substituted compounds often synthesized using transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling.

More recently, there have been numerous methodolog
ical advancements in the synthesis of highly substituted pyri
dines, many of which utilize transitionmetal catalyzed cross
coupling.7 However, these methodologies have rarely been 
tested in the realm of complex molecule synthesis. These li
monoid alkaloid natural products inspired a compelling ques
tion what are the most effective ways to use ring synthesis as 
a tool for convergence in the context of such highly substituted 
pyridines? Biosynthetically, it has been suggested that the tetrasubsti
tuted pyridine lodged in the limonoid alkaloids arises from a 
mexicanolidetype limonoid containing a C9hydroxyl group 
such as 21 (Scheme 2),4b or a limonoid at a different oxidation 
state.
