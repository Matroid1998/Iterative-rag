Description:
Corrodes in seawater contributing to electricity generation.

Text:
Currently, the electricity generation of WIEGs based on solidwater interactions is thought to 
be related to the streaming potential,43 dragging potential, and waving potential etc.44 Recently, Dao 
showed that the corrosion of zinc in seawater also contributes the electricity generation.41 
Nevertheless, the physical and electrochemical interactions between water and active 
materialscurrent collectors are not fully investigated due to the complexity at the liquidsolid 
interfaces. Little attention has been paid to possible electrochemical reactions between the active 
materials and current collectors, which may generate much higher voltage than the abovementioned 
potentials. In addition, there is no rational explanation of the contribution of electrochemical activity 
of current collectors, functional groups on active materials, and electrolyte ions to the electricity 
generation of WIEGs.
