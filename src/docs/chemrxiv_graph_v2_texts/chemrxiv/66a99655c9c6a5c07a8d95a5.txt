Description:
A promising alternative energy source due to its high energy density and water as its only byproduct.

Text:
As the global community faces mounting challenges related to finite fossil fuel supply and 
climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions, the transition toward sustainable energy 
sources has become imperative. Hydrogen is a promising alternative due to its high energy density, 
scalability and water as its only byproduct. It supports diverse energy needs, including hydrogen
powered fuel cells for reliable backup power in remote, gridunstable area, and can replace natural 
gas for heating or participate in industrial reactions, simplifying the transition to cleaner industrial 
energy systems1,2. Reports suggest that a fivefold increase in hydrogen production and utilization 
by 2050 could reduce U.S greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 10 from 2005 levels and 
potentially create 100,000 new jobs3.

Description:
Has low volumetric energy density necessitating high pressures for effective storage.

Text:
Despite these promising prospects, the widespread 
deployment of hydrogen technology faces a critical challenge effective and economical hydrogen 
storage solutions. Traditional storage methods such as highpressure compression or cryogenic 
liquefaction cannot scale on a physical or cost basis to meet emerging uses of hydrogen including 
long duration energy storage and industry scale decarbonization. Hydrogens low volumetric 
energy density necessitates extremely high pressures (typically 350 to 700 bar) for effective storage, 
requiring expansive compression and storage tank materials, and posing safety concerns4. Liquid 
hydrogen storage involves cooling hydrogen gas to a cryogenic temperature of 253 C, demands 
significant energy and infrastructure costs and has high boiloff rates5. Physisorption or 
chemisorption of hydrogen within solid state materials provides an alternative to traditional 
physically based hydrogen storage methods611.

Description:
A gas that can be released from liquid organic hydrogen carriers and metal hydrides through chemisorption methods requiring heat.

Text:
Liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) and 
metal hydrides (MHs) based chemisorption methods typically require a large amount of heat to 
release the hydrogen and can suffer from slow discharging kinetics1,12. In contrast, physisorption 
methods offer fast kinetics during discharge at moderate temperatures and pressures. Among various physisorption materials, metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are of great 
interest due to their porous structure, fast kinetics, and good cyclability13,14. They have high 
porosity and enormous internal surface areas, which, together with their extraordinary degree of 
tunability and variability for both the organic and inorganic components of their structures15,16, 
make them of great interest for gas storage.
