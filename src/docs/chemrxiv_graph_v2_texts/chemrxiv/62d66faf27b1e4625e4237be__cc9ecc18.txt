Description:
Extremely strong, uncharged Br√∏nsted bases containing a phosphorous atom bonded to four nitrogen atoms.

carbon or sulphur 
based Michael donors.6 However, within the last decades more and more oxaMichael reactions were 
reported6 and oxaMichael polymerisations, also named hydrogentransfer polymerisations,7 were 
conducted. Typically, oxaMichael reactions are Brnsted base catalysed8,9 and the most potent catalysts 
for 
oxaMichael 
polymerisations 
are 
phosphazene bases.10 Phosphazene bases are 
extremely strong, uncharged Brnsted bases 
that contain a phosphorous atom bonded to 
four nitrogen atoms and were disclosed by 
Schwesinger.11 Some of them, like 1tert
butyl2,2,4,4,4pentakis(dimethylamino)
25,45catenadi(phosphazen) (P2tBu, Fig. 1), 
are stable at ambient atmosphere making 
their use particularly attractive. The toxicity 
and the relatively high prices of phosphazene 
bases can be regarded as their downsides. Furthermore, their high basicity might be 
problematic when base labile substrates need 
to be used.
