Description:
A class of neurotransmitters that includes dopamine, involved in various brain functions.

The CB1 receptors are located in different parts of
the CNS such as the cerebral cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. THC is known to affect dopamine, a
neurotransmitter needed for motor control, arousal and more. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter, which is known to play a role in executive function, motor control,
motivation, arousal, reinforcement, and reward. Dopamine release can be stimulated by conducting pleasurable
behaviors. This causes the adrenal gland, which is located above the kidneys, to release dopamine. There are four
major dopaminergic pathways, the mesocortical pathway, the nigrostriatal pathway, the tuberoinfundibular pathway
and the mesolimbic pathway3. Dopamine has a number of essential functions in the brain. In particular, dopamine
released from the midbrain plays a crucial role in the mammalian central nervous system.
