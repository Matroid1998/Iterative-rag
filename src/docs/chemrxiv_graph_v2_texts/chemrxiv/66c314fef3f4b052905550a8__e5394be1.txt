Graphene heterostructures and 3D architectures, intricately patterned and combined with various 
functional materials, exhibit diverse properties and hold significant potential for advancing opto 
and bioelectronics, sensors, and energy conversion and storage technologies.1 Current 
patterning techniques mainly employ wet chemistry, focus on 2D functionalities, and do not 
allow vertical stacking in desired places.2 Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer 
deposition (MLD) are useful tools to control thin film growth on different surfaces.3 Both 
methods provide uniform layerbylayer growth over large areas, while MLD uses organic 
precursors instead of inorganic or metalbased reactants.4 The modularity of these techniques 
enables their combination into a process known as atomicmolecular layer deposition 
(ALDMLD).

Description:
Chemically inert but can be activated for ZnO deposition using femtosecond laser two-photon oxidation.

Selectivity can be enhanced using 
surface functionalization by selfassembled monolayers,17 electron beam irradiation,18 UV 
exposure,19 oxygen plasma treatment,20 or by growing lateral superlattices.21 
Recently, we proposed a way to overcome the chemical inertness of graphene to ALD precursors 
by locally activating the surface using direct femtosecond laser (fslaser) twophoton oxidation 
(TPO) for areaselective ZnO deposition.22 This method photochemically attaches oxygen
containing groups to graphene by exposing it to ultrafast laser pulses under an ambient 
atmosphere.23 As a result, hydroxyl and epoxy groups form on the graphene surface with 
moderate laser exposure, while carbonyl and carboxyl groups appear at higher irradiation doses, 
closer to the ablation threshold.24 TPO provides precise control over the oxidation level of 
graphene and enables the patterning of complex structures with high spatial resolution (300 
nm), with the potential to achieve 20 nm resolution using tipenhanced techniques.25 
Additionally, this is a simple, resistfree ultrafast direct laser writing (UDLW) method,26 and 
the oxidized graphene surface can be restored to its initial state through thermal annealing in an 
inert atmosphere.22
