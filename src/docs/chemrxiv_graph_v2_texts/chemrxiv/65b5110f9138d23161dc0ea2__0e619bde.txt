Regioselective hydration of 3methyl2heptene at either region 
Stereoselective reactions are those in which one enantiomerdiastereomerepimer of possibly 
two or more is produced predominantly.3 Stereoselective reactions are enantioselective, 
diastereoselective, or both.46 When a single chiral center is produced due to a reaction, the 
reaction is said to be enantioselective or asymmetric if one of the two enantiomers predominates. Asymmetry may occur under any of the following conditions 

the reagent is chiral 

the reactant has an existing chiral center that can interact with the reaction center
