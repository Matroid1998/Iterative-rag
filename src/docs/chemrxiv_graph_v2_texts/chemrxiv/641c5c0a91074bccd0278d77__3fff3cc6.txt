Description:
Molecules where helical frontier molecular orbitals appear, showing a correlation between chiroptical response and the splitting of near-degenerate helical MO pairs.

only the HOMOs are helical while the nondegenerate LUMO
and LUMO1 are delocalized due to spiroconjugation (Figure
1 right).2024 These helical frontier MOs are present in several
types of linear carbynelike and spiroconjugated molecules due to
the Mbius topology of the system.7,19,2530
We recently demonstrated a correlation exists between the chi
roptical response and the splitting of the neardegenerate heli
cal MO pairs in substituted allenes and longer oddcarbon cu
mulenes.6 In this article, we examine the underlying connection
between electrohelicity and optical activity in molecules where
helical frontier MOs appear. We treat four types of molecules that
