Description:
Involves charge transfer between surface oxygen and adjacent rare earth orbitals driving redox activity.

The ability to manipulate electronic structures in functional materials has dramatically advanced 
their use in energy conversion, catalysis, and environmental applications1,2. Among these, 
reducible rare earth oxides (REO2x, where RE  Ce, Pr, Tb) exhibit unique surface redox 
properties, which play a crucial role in heterogeneous catalysis3, solid oxide fuel cells4, and solar
driven fuel generation5. Central to these redox properties is the formation and annihilation of 
oxygen vacancies, which serve as reactive sites for adsorption, charge transfer, and mass transport. These processes are intricately linked to the electronic structure of 4f bands in rare earth oxides, 
where charge transfer between surface oxygen (O 2p) and the adjacent rare earth (RE 4f) orbitals 
drives redox activity10.
