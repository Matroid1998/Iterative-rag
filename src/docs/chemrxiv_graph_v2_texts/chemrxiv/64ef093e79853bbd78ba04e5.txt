Description:
Produced via enzymatic synthesis routes.

Biocatalytic transformations are becoming increasingly impor
tant, attractive, and accessible for the synthesis of pharmaceu
ticals or fine chemicals.111 Recently, enzymatic synthesis routes
to chemicals such as 1,4butanediol,12 branched chain higher al
cohols13 or complex natural products such as the investigational
HIV treatment islatravir,14 or the investigational antiviral agent
molnupravir15 were developed. This interest is largely owed to
the high chemo, stereo and regioselectivity of enzymes,25,1618
their applicability in mild reaction conditions and aqueous media,
as well as their compatibility making the combination of several
reaction steps in a single reaction vessel possible.3,17,19
Since enzymes can exhibit both substrate and reaction promis
cuity,20 i.e. can act on nonnative substrates or catalyze new re
actions, the toolbox of possible biocatalytic transformations ex
tends well beyond reactions seen in nature.
