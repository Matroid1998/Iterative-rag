Description:
Used as an antidust coating affecting the behavior of underlying materials.

Text:
The addition 
of a silicone antidust coating creates yet another variable that must be considered. Thus, we have 
conducted a study of siliconecoated and uncoated carbon fiber preform and PICA in order to gain 
a better understanding of how this coating affects the behavior of the underlying material. Knowing 
how to predict the material response of these heat shields is essential for reducing uncertainty and 
designing highperformance, lightweight heat shields for future missions. A number of previous studies have looked at the material response for different types of 
model systems. These have primarily involved massloss measurements of different types of 
composites, including matrixinhibited carboncarbon composites1113, chars14, 15, and 
CSiC composites1621. Our group has conducted molecular beamsurface scattering studies to
