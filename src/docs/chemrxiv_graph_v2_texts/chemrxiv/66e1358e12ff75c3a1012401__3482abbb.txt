Description:
A precursor used for ALD of titanium nitride.

Text:
The 
homoleptic 
amide 
precursor 
tris(dimethylamido)aluminum(III) (Al(NMe2)3, TDMAA), is therefore an interesting alternative, 
but it is less explored for ALD.7 TDMAA has been used for AlN in thermal8 and in plasma ALD9 
with NH3 as a coreactant but neither theoretical nor experimental surface reaction studies for ALD 
of AlN from TDMAA have been reported to date. The dimethylamido ligand has been extensively used for ALD of titanium nitride (TiN) in the 
tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium(IV) (Ti(NMe2)4, TDMAT) precursor.
