Therefore, in order to understand the various properties at molecular level such as microsolvation process, it is 
of utmost importance to study the structure, stability and HB strength in (H2S)n and mixed (H2O)m(H2S)n clusters. For this purpose, there are several experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out which utilizes small 
model molecular aggregatesclusters to represent the bulk system. Saykally and coworkers1316 carried out many spectral studies to investigate the structure and dynamics of 
various water (H2O)n (n26) clusters. These studies revealed that cyclic trimer, tetramer and pentamer clusters 
of water have minimum energies structures. Water hexamer having cagelike structure with eight HB is the most 
stable one. Kulcke et al.17 studied the absorption behaviour of small water clusters (H2O)n, (n  25).
