Description:
Used in nanocatalysts that maintain activity at higher voltages in PEMFCs.

Text:
In addition, it is worth noting that the mixedpotential 
can be as high as 1.5 V during the startstop process andor transient condition of the PEMFC,2 
which can aggravate the oxidation of the catalysts. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop 
Ptbased nanocatalysts that can maintain activity at higher voltage. The wellknown strain or ligand effect, i.e. alloying Pt with elements that have smaller atomic 
radii is an effective strategy to improve its activity and stability. To date, progresses have been 
made in improving the activity as well as the oxidation resistance of Ptbased catalysts by 
surface modification (e.g. introducing antidissolution element), and thereby enhancing the 
catalytic activity and durability.
