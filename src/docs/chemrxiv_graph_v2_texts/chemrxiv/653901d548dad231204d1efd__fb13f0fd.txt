Description:
Observed in gas phase with determined equilibrium structure.

Text:
These latter authors have observed the gas phase of the 1 and 2 fundamental bands of
H2Cl and determined its equilibrium structure. The rotational spectra of H2Cl and HDCl were measured
by Araki et al 12 using a submillimeterwave spectrometer. Furthermore, theoretically, Botschwina 13
computed a potential energy surface (PES) at coupled electronpair approximation (CEPA) level and the
vibrational frequencies for H2Cl and its isotopologues HDCl and D2Cl. More recently, after the detection
of the chloronium ion, Majumdar et al 14 explored the possibility of finding the isotopologues of H2Cl in
and around the ISM. These authors used MollerPlesset perturbation theory (MP2) along with a quadruplezeta
