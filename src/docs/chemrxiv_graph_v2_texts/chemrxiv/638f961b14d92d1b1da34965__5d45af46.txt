Description:
A polymer used in pioneering studies on polymer electrolytes when complexed with alkali metal salts.

Text:
For example, most of the pioneering studies on polymer electrolytes are based on polyethy
lene oxide (PEO) complexed with alkali metal salts.6,7 Ionic liquids have been either mixed
into neutral polymer bases or polymerized into poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) for engineering
various electrochemical devices.8,9 Ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC) consisting of a
polyelectrolyte membrane placed in between two noble metal electrodes have been studied
to enable large actuation under an applied electric field.10 Continued effort has been made
to both develop novel ionically conductive polymers and understand fundamental ion con
ducting mechanisms to enable rational design based on application functional requirements.
