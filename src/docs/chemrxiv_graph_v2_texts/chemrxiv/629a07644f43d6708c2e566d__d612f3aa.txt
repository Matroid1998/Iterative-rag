Description:
A ligand incorporated into coreshell materials.

Text:
In a second step, instead of isolating 
the crystals, the supernatant was exchanged for a solution of the other ligand. The solvothermal 
synthesis was then continued (see ESI for details). The resulting crystalline materials were 
characterized by powder Xray diffraction (pXRD) and optical microscopy. The ratio between H2TCPP 
and Pt(II)TCPP incorporated into the coreshell materials was determined by digestion and
