Description:
Nanoporous materials where nonwetting liquids penetrate under high pressure, converting mechanical energy into fluid-solid interface energy.

Text:
In the past years, a new field of application in energy storage was discovered for hydrophobic
nanoporous materials,18 where the nonwetting liquid penetrates the pores under high pres
sure, resulting in conversion of mechanical energy into fluidsolid interface energy. When the
pressure is released, the mechanical energy can be restored upon release of the fluid. Histor
ically, intrusion of water in puresilica zeolites (also called zeosils) has been first reported
in 20019 and represents the starting point of subsequent intrusion and extrusion experiments
performed on various zeosils.1019 Later, Tzanis and coworkers20 discovered that replacing
pure water by electrolyte solutions is an effective way to increase the mechanical energy
stored in zeosils, due to a shift of intrusion pressure towards higher values.

Description:
Puresilica zeolites consistently display a strong hydrophobic character.

Text:
Moreovre, we showed that the shift of intrusion pressure is more complex than a
simple osmotic effect, because electrolytes are nonideal solutions. Taking into account the
water activity, which we calculated by the Pitzer model39,40 for each electrolyte over a wide
range of concentration, can explain the experimental data available. Puresilica zeolites consistently display a strong hydrophobic character, but its exact ex
tent can depend on the synthesis conditions of the material. Zeosils are typically obtained
through hydrothermal synthesis41 using fluoride (F) or hydroxide (HO) anions. Patarin
and coworkers9 highlighted that the intrusion pressure of water was higher for silicalite1
