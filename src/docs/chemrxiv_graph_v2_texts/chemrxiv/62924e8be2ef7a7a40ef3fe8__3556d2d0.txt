They studied about 79 antiMXene
materials and found that around 24 antiMXene materials are stable. Moreover, they found two
of these materials, CoB and FeB, suitable for LIB applications with high specific charge
capacities (1099.44 and 1135.77 mAhg1, respectively). Inspired by these findings, in this work,
we have explored six cobalt (Co) containing antiMXene materials, namely, CoAs, CoB, CoP,
CoS, CoSe, and CoSi, and inspected their ability to serve as anode materials in sodiumion
batteries (NIBs). Using density functional theory calculations, we computed various physical and
electrochemical properties such as specific charge capacity, opencircuit voltage, Naatom
binding energy, Naion diffusion barrier, etc. Our calculations suggested that sodium has greater
binding energy (0.55 to 1.16 eV) and reasonably low diffusion energy barriers (0.32 to 0.59 eV)
on CoantiMXenes.
