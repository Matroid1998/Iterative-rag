Description:
Incorporation into cyclic compounds enhances therapeutic efficacy in medicinal chemistry.

Text:
Incorporation of fluorine atoms into cyclic compounds has 
recently emerged as a cornerstone strategy in medicinal 
chemistry for enhancing therapeutic efficacy.13,14 Fluorination 
offers unique opportunities to modulate the physicochemical 
characteristics of (hetero)cyclic structures, thereby influencing 
their interactions with biological targets and pharmacokinetic 
behavior.15 Along with notable influence on the aciditybasicity 
of ionizable groups1618 and lipophilicity of the whole 
molecule,19 fluorinationbased strategy could offer the possibility 
of radiolabelling active therapeutics for in vivo probing 
purposes20 or eliminate the instable functionalities via the 
bioisosteric replacement approach.14,2123 
Despite the growing number of examples of latestage 
fluorination of the complex organic structures,24,25 fluorinated 
building blocks15,26,27 are still keeping their dominating role as a 
source of Fluorine in complex fluorinated compounds.2830 
Extensive application of the fluorinated fragments raised a 
question of their rational exploitation, thus encouraging a series 
of systematic studies in this area.
