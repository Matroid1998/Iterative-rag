Description:
A binary compound with complex defect chemistry and deep defect states detrimental to PVPEC performance.

Text:
Originally it was thought that Sb2Se3 would exhibit low defect concentration as 
it is a binary compound (better stoichiometric control) with benign grain boundaries.3 However, 
recent computational studies have shown the complex defect chemistry of Sb2Se3 and the formation 
of deep defect states that are detrimental to PVPEC performance.4 Cationanion antisite defects 
have been shown to have a low formation energy and are energetically positioned close to the mid 
gap, serving as deep recombination centers. Therefore, the understanding and the 
suppressionpassivation of such deep defects is crucial for the further development of Sb2Se3 as a 
PVPEC material.
