Description:
Induces actin bundle formation due to crowding and depletion interactions with filamentous actin.

Shear forces can induce nematic patterns56,57 and introduce hysteresis58,59. Van der Waals attraction between
filaments promotes adhesive interfilament interactions that lead to gradual relaxation of prestress60,61. Polyethylene glycol
(PEG) is known to induce actin bundle formation owing to crowding and depletion interactions between filamentous actin and
the polymer62. Morphological changes in the Factin depend on the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer in
the solution63,64. For instance, 0.1 wv (or 1 mgmL) PEG with a molecular weight of 20 kDa can result in strong bundling,
whereas PEG with 6 kDa at the same concentration produces weakly bundled networks65. Although the bundling degree of
actin filaments under morphology control has been established and studied65, the effects of bundling degree on actin molecular
