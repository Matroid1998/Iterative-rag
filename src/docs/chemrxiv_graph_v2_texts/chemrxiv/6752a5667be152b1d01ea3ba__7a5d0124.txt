The cyclopropane ring is a key motif in organic chemistry, often employed as an isostere for alkyl, 
arene, and alkene groups.1 This strained threemembered carbocycle is a structural feature in 
numerous drugs and fragrances, and serves as a versatile building block for complex molecule 
synthesis.2 Consequently, the seamless integration of cyclopropanes into complex molecular 
frameworks is a significant goal within the synthetic organic chemistry community.
