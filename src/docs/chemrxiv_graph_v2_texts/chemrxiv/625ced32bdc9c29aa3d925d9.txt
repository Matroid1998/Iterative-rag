Description:
Used in spin-column kits for nucleic acid extraction.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as qPCR have remained the primary 
intervention for the detection and containment of a pathogenmediated disease outbreak and also for 
screening genetic diseases, food soiling, and biowarfare prevention. The utility of NAATs is, however, 
dependent on the quality of nucleic acid templates being used, where the presence of DNA polymerase 
inhibitors may affect its efficacy as well as accuracy1. Silicabased spincolumn kits, magnetic particles, 
or automated extractionamplification systems could be utilized to extract nucleic acid from the sample 
of interest. Despite established sensitivity, automated extraction systems remain expensive with high 
per sample cost2, while silicabased spincolumn kits require centralized highspeed centrifuges. Commercial magnetic particles, either silica or carboxyl coated, or pHmodulated chargeswitching 
chitosanbased, are costly.

Displays a negative surface charge over a large pH range.

This includes the use 
of filter paper that enable nucleic acid extraction from various matrices as well as a filter paper fitted 
device for the same5, inhouse preparable spincolumn using filter papers6, and pipetteactuated 
magnetic beads among others7. While these platforms have greatly advanced the innovations necessary 
for a limitedresource NAATs detection, neither uses readily available materials or equipment for 
preparing a nucleic acid extraction system. This would especially be of significant importance in a 
developing country where items such as filter paper for fabricating a spin column are relatively 
unavailable. Like silica, cellulose displays a negative surface charge over a large pH range8. Similarly, 
cellulosebased Whatman filter paper discs have been deployed in the extraction of genomic DNA from 
plant extracts and complex biofluid5.
