Description:
Formed as an intermediate in Pd(0) oxidative addition reactions.

Text:
In addition, selective Pd(0) 
OA in the presence of two or more organic halides will usually determine the chemo
selectivity in many Pd catalyzed dominoonepot reactions1724 resulting into complex 
functional molecules in an efficient manner. Scheme 1. Pd(0) Oxidative addition to organic halides. Pd(0)
