Description:
An autoinducer of the Rhl system.

Text:
N3oxododecanoyl 
homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) is the autoinducer of the Las system, while butyryl homoserine lactone 
(C4HSL) is an autoinducer of the Rhl system 4, 10 (Figure 1). 2heptyl3hydroxy4quinolone (PQS) is the associated autoinducer to PQS system. PQS is recognized by 
PqsR and synthesized by multiple proteins, as PqsB, PqsC, PqsD, and others 12, 13. 2(2
hydroxyphenyl)thiazole4carbaldehyde (IQS) is an autoinducer for IQS system. Previous studies 
established the activation of QS by IQS in deficiency of Las system, generating interest for its study 7, 14. LasR, RhlR, and PqsR AIs are shown in Figure 1.
