Description:
Used in supercapacitive techniques as inexpensive, nontoxic activated carbon materials.

Text:
Supercapacitive techniques are attractive alternatives to redoxbased techniques, and can be divided 
into membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI), and supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA).14,15 In 
contrast to redoxbased techniques, the potential window is continuously variable, and the methods 
are based on inexpensive, nontoxic activated carbon materials and aqueous solutions. Moreover,
