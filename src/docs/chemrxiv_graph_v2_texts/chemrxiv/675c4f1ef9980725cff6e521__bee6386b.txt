Description:
A group V-VII transition metal used in catalysts for its oxygen affinity and ability to introduce Br√∏nsted or Lewis acidity.

The synthesis of renewable fuels and platform chemicals from 
oxygenrich biomass, such as lignin, requires the selective re
moval of oxygencontaining functional groups with green hy
drogen.14 This pivotal process, referred to as hydrodeoxygena
tion (HDO) and used in the petrochemical industry, has been 
the subject of intensive research in the past decades.57 Effi
ciently achieving this transformation would facilitate the large
scale production of biobased fuels and chemicals, reducing the 
dependency on fossil resources and contributing to a sustainable 
circular economy and a closed carbon cycle.811 
Breaking CO bonds is associated with a significant energy bar
rier due to their high kinetic and thermodynamic stability, re
quiring the use of catalysts.12, 13 Heterogeneous catalysts for 
HDO often comprise late transition metals  to activate dihy
drogen  combined with a group VVII transition metal, in par
ticular Mo, that are thought to facilitate the activation of the C
O bond because of their oxygen affinity and their ability to in
troduce Brnsted andor Lewis acidity.1420 These bifunctional
bimetallic catalysts can lead to enhanced activity compared to 
the corresponding monometallic materials, suggesting a syn
ergy that is crucial for the desired reactivity.2124 However, the 
exact role and interplay of the components in these catalysts are 
still poorly understood and often remain speculative, mainly 
due to the complexity of these materials.13, 25 
In classical synthetic approaches, metallic nanoparticles of late 
transition metals (M) are commonly prepared via impregnation 
techniques, often relying on metal chloride (or nitrate) precur
sors, possibly leading to contamination or uneven particle for
mation.26, 27 While cost and time efficient, these approaches 
generally afford rather illdefined materials, with nonuniform 
distribution of surface sites and particle sizes.
