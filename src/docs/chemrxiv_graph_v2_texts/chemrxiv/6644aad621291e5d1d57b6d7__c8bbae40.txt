Description:
An ultrawide bandgap semiconductor with outstanding hardness, high carrier mobility, high breakdown field, and record thermal conductivity.

Diamond is recognized as an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor 1 of outstanding hard
ness, 2 high carrier mobility, high breakdown field, 3 and record thermal conductivity, 4
which lead to a broad range of applications, notably in highfrequency and highpower
electronics. 5 Recent theories and experiments demonstrate even that diamond can be ob
tained in twodimensional forms. 6, 7 To take advantage of it in electronics, efficient doping
is needed, akin to other semiconductors. However, the small lattice constant and strong CC
bonds make the lattice too tight for most elements to be effectively inserted.

Description:
Doping is suppressed by low dopant concentrations, limited by thermodynamic solubility, and large activation energies from the deep ingap dopant levels.

8 Even when
achieved, either ptype (boron B) 9 or ntype (nitrogen N or phosphorus P), 10 doping of
diamond is suppressed by low dopant concentrations, limited by thermodynamic solubility,
and large activation energies from the deep ingap dopant levels. 11, 12 Moreover, the prac
tice of heavy doping undesirably decreases the carrier mobility. 13 Among the efforts to
overcome these obstacles and realize diamondbased semiconductor devices, a welldeserved
attention is captured by the transfer doping, which is achieved by integrating a thin layer
of acceptor on the hydrogenated diamond (Hdiamond) surface. 1419 The acceptor layer
candidates range from gas adsorbates, 14, 20 metal oxides, 18, 21, 22 to van der Waals
twodimensional (2D) materials.
