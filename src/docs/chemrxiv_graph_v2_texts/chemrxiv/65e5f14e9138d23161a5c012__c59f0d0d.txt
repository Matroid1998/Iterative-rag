Description:
Acts as a linker in Zrnaphtalenedicarboxylate MOFs where holes localize.

The main bottleneck is the collection the light 
on large area around the catalytic centre followed by an ultrafast and efficient energy transfer to 
achieve multiple electron injections on a short period of time. Ultrafast timeresolved spectroscopy has been applied to resolve the formation of separated 
electronhole pairs (eh) between linkers and metal centres in metalorganicframeworks (MOFs). Douhal and coworker14,15 have shown that in Zrnaphtalenedicarboxylate (ZrNDC) MOFs the charge 
separation takes place within less than 200 fs, leading to the formation of electrons and holes localized 
on the Zr clusters and on the naphtalene linkers, respectively. The (e h) pairs can be engaged in one
electrons redox reactions.
