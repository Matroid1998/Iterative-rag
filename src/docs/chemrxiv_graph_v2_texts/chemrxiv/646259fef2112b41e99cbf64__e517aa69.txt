Description:
A common anion used in battery electrolytes.

Text:
The previously reported decoupled SPEs tend to use anionic groups (e.g., carboxylates and sulfonates) 
that are more Lewis basic, i.e., less dissociative, than common anions used in battery electrolytes such as 
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI, 7).21 Even when softer, more dissociative anions such as 
sulfonimides are employed for polyanion designs, the linkers required to conjugate these anions to
