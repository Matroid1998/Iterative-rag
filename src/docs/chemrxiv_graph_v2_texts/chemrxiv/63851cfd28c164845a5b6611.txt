Description:
A product whose loss from the reaction mixture prevents the cleavage reaction from reversing at an appreciable rate.

Text:
This is necessary and 
correct because all reactions are technically reversible with the 
forward and reverse rate constants related by the corresponding 
equilibrium constant. Thus, it is never accurate to set a reverse 
rate constant arbitrarily to 0  this would correspond to the re
action free energy being infinite and negative. However, it is 
true that many reactions are practically irreversible if one of the 
products is lost from the system. For example, in the case of 
catenane 6, the loss of CO2 from the reaction mixture during the 
operation prevents the cleavage reaction from reversing at an 
appreciable rate.
