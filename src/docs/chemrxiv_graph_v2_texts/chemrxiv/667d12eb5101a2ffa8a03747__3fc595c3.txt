Description:
A single-molecule magnet with Ueff 1223(15) cm-1 and TH 60 K due to axial ligand field and rigid aromatic rings.

Text:
The first Dy(III) complex containing no equatoriallybound ligands, Dy(Cpttt)2B(C6F5)4 
(Cpttt  C5H2tBu31,2,4), was reported in 2017; this SMM showed Ueff  1223(15) cm1 and TH  
60 K due to a combination of the axial ligand field and rigid aromatic CpR (substituted 
cyclopentadienyl) rings hindering both Orbach and Raman relaxation.13 Related Ln SMMs with 
higher Ueff and TH values have since been achieved by decreasing LnL (L  ligand) distances and
