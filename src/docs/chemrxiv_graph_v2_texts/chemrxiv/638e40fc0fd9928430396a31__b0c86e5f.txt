Description:
Grown using thermal NH3 and trimethyl aluminum.

Text:
Plasma ALD has successfully been used to deposit InN with both N2 57 and NH3 8 
plasma together with TMI at temperatures below the thermal decomposition of InN. Precursors with chelating ligands forming NIn bonds have also been used successfully to 
deposit InN with NH3 plasma.9,10 However, a thermal ALD process has not been shown 
experimentally. This is in contrast to the other group 13N semiconductors AlN and GaN 
which both has been grown using thermal NH3 and trimethyl aluminum (TMA, Al(CH3)3) 
11,12 and trimethyl gallium (TMG, Ga(CH3) 3) 13,14 respectively.
