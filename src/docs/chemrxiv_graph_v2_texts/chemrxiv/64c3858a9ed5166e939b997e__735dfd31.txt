Description:
A phase of MnO2 with unchanged intrinsic electronic conductivity that can be modified by incorporating heteroatoms to alter its electronic structure.

Text:
One of the most common 
approaches involves synthetizing hybrid compounds by combining MnO2 with electronically 
conductive carbon material such as carbon nanotube,16,17 carbon fiber,18,19 graphene20,21 or 
conductive polymer.22,23 Another interesting approach to boost the electronic conductivity is 
the elaboration of compositesnanocomposites MnO2conductive metal24 or MnO2transition 
metal oxides.25,26 Although these approaches improve overall conductivity, the intrinsic 
electronic conductivity of the birnessite phase remains unchanged and the performance of 
composite electrode materials heavily relies on achieving a homogeneous distribution between 
the electronic conductive phase and MnO2.26 To overcome this issue, it is possible to 
incorporate heteroatom into birnessite to change its electronic structure and reduce its electronic 
band gap.2730 For instance, Liu et al.

Description:
A phase resulting from low temperature synthesis with poor crystallinity.

Text:
have demonstrated through first principle calculations that 
a partial substitution of Mn34 by Fe3 in the metal oxide layer reduces the electronic band gap 
from 1.03 eV to 0.62 eV (for 33 mol of substitution) and enhances the specific capacity when 
compared to MnO2 at equivalent chargingdischarging rates.31 However, some aspects related 
to Fe incorporation into MnO2 (FeMnO2) still require clarification. The commonly used low
temperature synthesis, aiming at achieving nanostructuration, results in birnessite phases with 
poor crystallinity, limiting detailed structural investigations of the localization of Fe and its 
impact on the interlayer site (prismatic or octahedral). Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms 
in FeMnO2 during cycling remain unknown due to the potential redox activity of both Fe and 
Mn elements 31,32.
