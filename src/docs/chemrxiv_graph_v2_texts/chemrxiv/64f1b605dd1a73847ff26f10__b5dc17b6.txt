Description:
Used as an active electrode material in commercial batteries.

In addition, 
some organic electrodes can be obtained from biomass and 
recycled.12 However, one of the main limitations of organic 
electrode materials (especially small organic molecules) is their 
high solubility in the electrolyte, resulting in rapid capacity 
fading.9 An efficient strategy to overcome such solubility issues 
is to covalently bind electroactive monomers to form organic 
polymers, which are normally insoluble in aqueous and organic 
electrolytes.13,14 
After their discovery in the late 1970s,15 many conductive 
polymers were explored as electrodes in lithium metalorganic 
batteries, and even some companies (BridgestoneSeiko and 
VartaBASF) developed commercial batteries based on 
poly(pyrrole) and poly(aniline) as active electrode materials.14 
Nevertheless, such polymerbased batteries were quickly 
discontinued due to selfdischarge issues and poor performance 
compared to lithiumion batteries, which were commercialised 
by Sony in 1991.16 After a period where organic electrodes 
received less attention, the discovery of organic radical 
batteries17,18 and the bright future for organic batteries 
vaticinated by Armand and Tarascon in 20083 revived the field 
with a remarkable progress in the last 15 years.
