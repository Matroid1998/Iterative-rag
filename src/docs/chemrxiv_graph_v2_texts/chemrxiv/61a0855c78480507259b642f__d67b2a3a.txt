Used in photoelectrocatalytic systems for visible light-driven water oxidation to dioxygen.

In terms of sustainability, low cost and nontoxicity, one of the most 
attractive materials for photo(electro)catalytic applications are polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx).6,7 
Carbon nitrides are readily available, tunable and chemically robust polymers,8 that have been widely 
utilized in a variety of lightdriven chemical processes such as hydrogen evolution,912 CO2 
reduction,13,14 selective chemical syntheses,1518 or organic pollutants degradation.19,20 However, 
the studies demonstrating visible lightdriven water oxidation to dioxygen using CNxbased 
photoelectrocatalytic systems are still rather rare.21,22 This is, on the one hand, due to the notoriously 
slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),23 which typically results in accumulation of 
oxidizing equivalents that translates in enhanced photocorrosion of CNx.24 On the other hand, the 
very fabrication of mechanically robust CNxbased photoelectrodes is challenging,25,26 in particular 
due to the poor adhesion of CNx to conductive substrates,2730 and the very low conductivity of CNx 
films, hindering efficient charge transport to the external circuit.31 
In our own work, we have been developing a distinct type of hybrid CNxbased photoanodes in which 
a thin layer of CNx is deposited onto a porous TiO2 layer that acts as an electroncollecting scaffold, 
overcoming thus at the same time both the problems of low adhesion and low electronic conductivity 
of CNx.
