Description:
Serves as a medium for the synthesis of ultrathin nanocoils from indium acetate and sulfur.

As far as 2D
nanomaterials are concerned, Park et al. have rst reported
the colloidal synthesis of In2S3 hexagonal nanoplates (8)
while the Pradhan group obtained large (1 m) indium
sulde nanosheets through the thermal decomposition of
indium trisdiethyldithiocarbamate in hexadecylamine (16). Similar wrinkled nanosheets have been observed as transient
intermediates towards smaller (60 nm) hexagonal In2S3
nanoplates when InCl3 and thiourea are used as precursors
in oleylamine (17). Shape control can also be achieved
using other strategies without varying the precursor sources
Ni et al. obtained nanotubes from the selfassembly of
ultrathin nanocoils synthesized from indium acetate and
sulfur in octylamine (18, 19), whereas Tian et al.
