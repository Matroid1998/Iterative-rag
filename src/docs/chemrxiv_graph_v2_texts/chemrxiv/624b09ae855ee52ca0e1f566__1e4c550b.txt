Description:
Involves vibrational states responsible for internal conversion between different excited states.

Text:
Rutheniumbased transition metal complexes, particularly Ru(II) polypyridyl motifs, exhibit 
attractive photophysical and photochemical properties due to the presence of many excitedstate 
electronic configurations which are governed by ligand coordination.13 In general, three types of 
lowlying excited states are present in these complexes, namely metaltoligandcharge transfer 
(MLCT), metalcentered (MC) and ligandcentered (LC) states. Recent twodimensional 
spectroscopic studies have pinpointed RuN and other vibrational states responsible for internal 
conversion between different excited states in a Rupolypyridine complex.4 The relative energy 
order of the excited states depends on the ligand field strength and its standard reduction potential.
