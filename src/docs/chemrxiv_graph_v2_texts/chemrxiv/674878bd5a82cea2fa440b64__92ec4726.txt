Description:
An oxidation state of nickel reached upon further charging of NiOOH.

Text:
The NiOOH phase is 
unstable at open circuit potential, but is created when polarizing 
the Ni(OH)2 phase, of which two polymorphs exist, where 
Ni(OH)2 is a hydrated, disordered form of Ni(OH)2.17,18 
Charging of Ni(OH)2 first leads to an oxidation of Ni2 to Ni3 and 
a phase change to NiOOH. Upon further charging, the oxidation 
state of Ni increases up to Ni3.66 and a NiOOH phase is formed. When starting with Ni(OH)2, immediately NiOOH crystallizes 
upon polarization.
