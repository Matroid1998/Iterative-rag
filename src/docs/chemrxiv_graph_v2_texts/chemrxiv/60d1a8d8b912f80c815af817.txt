Description:
The most used anode material in lithium ion batteries due to its low price and good cycling stability.

Text:
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are already an important part of our everyday life that have enabled 
the rise of portable electronics. Looking in the short, middleterm, LIBs also hold tremendous 
potential to substitute the use of fossil fuels in transportation, with the still incipient Electric 
Vehicle (EV) market expansion 13. They have also found applications in decentralizing energy 
storage in residential areas, and they are being adopted for partially solving gridunbalance issues 
caused by fluctuations in energy generation of renewable power sources 4,5. However, 
increasing the energy density of LIBs remains a primary challenge for enabling some of the 
aforementioned applications. Focusing on the anode side, graphite is the most used material, 
thanks to its low price and good cycling stability 6.

Description:
Has a maximum theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAhg.

Text:
Nevertheless, the maximum specific capacity 
that can be theoretically reached with graphite is 372 mAhg, which limits the range of use cases 
for LIBs. In these regards, alloy negative electrodes, and in particular silicon (Si) 7, stands out 
as a promising candidate for next generation LIB anodes. When fully lithiated, Si forms the Li15Si4 
alloy, showing a high theoretical specific capacity of 3579 mAhg, ten times larger than graphite. It also shows an appropriate voltage (0.4 V) for being adopted as an anode. However, Si 
undergoes a 300 volume expansion upon charging, which induces Si particle pulverization, 
unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and contact loss between Si and conductive 
additives because of internal stresses 8,9.
