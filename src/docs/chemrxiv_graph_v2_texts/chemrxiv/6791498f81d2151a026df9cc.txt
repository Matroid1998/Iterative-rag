Description:
Poisons platinum-based catalysts at ppm concentrations.

Text:
In our previous work, Rosenberg et al. used the stabilization from high mixing entropy to force 
platinum to alloy into the high entropy boride (HEB) Al0.2Nb0.2Pt0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2B2. This was the highest 
coordinated platinumboride species reported thus far, a remarkable 12coordinated platinum 
boride phase.1 Platinum borides prior to the discovery of this HEB, were only boron poor phases 
with low platinum coordination Pt3B2 (platinum coordinated by 6 borons), PtB (platinum 
coordinated by 6 borons), and Pt2B (platinum coordinated by 3 borons).24 The fascination with 
forming a platinum high entropy diboride, comes from its unique crystal structure of alternating 
borophene sheets and metal (Figure 1). Platinum based catalysts are poisoned by ppm 
concentrations of sulfur.
