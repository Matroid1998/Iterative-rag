Description:
Used in complexes for studying electron transfer and molecular assemblies.

Text:
Photo physical properties of ruthenium complexes are much attention in 
recent years for its wide application is the study of electron transfer1,2, molecular 
assemblies3,4 and amide bridges containing peptides and proteins. groups5,6. A key feature of 
these applications is the electron distribution of ruthenium complexes measured by its acid 
dissociation constants of the ground and excited states.

Involved in excited-state charge distribution and electron transfer in complexes.

Text:
Several research group7,8,9,10 
explored excitedstate charge distribution and electron transfer (ET) in ruthenium complexes 
especially in combination with proteins and polypeptides 
Present work In continuing our work on photoredox, we succeeded in synthesizing the 
Fluorescence Probe11 to investigate cytochrome c folding kinetics and Synthesizing the 
photoredox ruthenium bipyridyl were linked with biomolecules having oxidative quencher,

viologen12, herein we disclosed design of RutheniumDipeptide molecule 1 (figure1) which 
allows for many variations of the ruthenium Phenanthroline5Amine 3 and dipeptide 
structures 2, The synthetic routes are straightforward and very manageable, it is possible to 
use commercially available Lamino acids as enantiomerically enriched starting materials.
