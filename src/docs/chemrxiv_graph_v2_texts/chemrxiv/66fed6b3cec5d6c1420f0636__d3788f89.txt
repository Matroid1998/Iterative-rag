Description:
A transparent conductive oxide used in transparent PZT-based piezoelectrics.

Text:
In addition to being electrically conductive, some oxides are also 
transparent, and so they are called Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCOs).11 This 
makes them particularly useful in optical applications.12 Some TCOs such as AlZnO, 
FSnO2 (FTO) and SnIn2O3 (ITO) have been recently used as conductive oxides in 
transparent PZTbased piezoelectrics.1316 High transmittance values can been 
achieved but, depending on thickness and orientation, the formation of large 
ferroelectric domains might lead to optical dispersion. One successful way to 
improve the transparency is by AC cyclical poling.17 Another way is to reduce the 
size of the crystallites, which makes them invisible to visible wavelengths. Unfortunately, the last option might cause a decrease in the remnant Pr of 
conventional ferroelectrics.
