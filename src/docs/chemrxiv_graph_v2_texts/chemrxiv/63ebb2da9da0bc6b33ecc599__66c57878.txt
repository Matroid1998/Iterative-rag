Description:
Used in direct borohydride fuel cells as a solution on the anode.

Text:
The electrochemical catalysts have attracted enormous attention with the increasing demand for 
renewable energy storage and conversion.1,2 The hydrogen produced by water splitting from a 
renewable energy source is regarded as one of the clean energy technologies without CO2 emission. The green hydrogen from the renewable electrolysis of water could be utilized in the fuel cell for 
supplying electricity and heat. Liquid fuelbased fuel cells have been looked into for use in portable 
devices due to the simple recharging of fuel.3 The direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs) are 
operated by sodium borohydride solution and hydrogen peroxide solution on the anode and cathode, 
respectively.
