Description:
A compound that can produce racemic aryl ketones via radical 1,2-aryl migration.

Text:
It has been shown that the addition 
of various radicals to the olefin of an allylic alcohol can produce 
racemic aryl ketones via a radical 1,2aryl migration 
mechanism.911 In a few cases, it has been shown that a single 
electron transfer (SET) event can occur to generate a carbocation 
before aryl migration ensues.12,13
