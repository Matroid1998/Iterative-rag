Important structural units in natural products and biologically significant molecules.

Text:
Cyclobutanes represent important structural units in natural 
product and other biologically significant molecules.1 Moreover, 
the cyclobutane scaffold, especially 1,3difunctionalized 
cyclobutane skeleton, is often incorporated in drug design, such 
as PF03654746,2 linsitinib,3 and TAK828F4 (Scheme 1A).

Description:
Compounds that can undergo ring-opening reactions with radical or polar nucleophiles.

In 
this direction, there are six general strategies for intermolecular 
ringopening reactions of BCBs (Scheme 1B) (1) Radical strain
release reactions with radical nucleophiles. This strategy 
provides powerful methods for making mostly 1,3disubstituted 
alkylated 
cyclobutanes, 
albeit 
mainly 
with 
poor 
diastereoselectivity (not shown).7d,14 (2) Polar strainrelease 
reactions with 2electronbased nucleophiles. The nucleophilic 
ring opening reactions of BCBs concerned mainly the addition 
of various heteroatom (O, N, P)centred nucleophiles,15 such as 
Hozs 
Ocyclobutylation,15a 
Aggarwals 
selective 
ring
openings,15b Gaonis azidation,15c Barans amination,15d Wipfs 
hydrophosphination15e and others.15f By contrast, the successful 
use of carbon nucleophilic reagents in addition reactions to 
BCBs still lags behind and had been limited to the strong 
nucleophiles like organocuprates.7ac Once again, poor 
diastereoselectivity was detected in these examples (not 
shown).
