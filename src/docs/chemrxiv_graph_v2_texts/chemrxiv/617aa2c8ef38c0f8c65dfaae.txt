Description:
An ICT molecule built up of numerous weakly coupled chromophores, conjugated through twisted bonds and/or cross conjugation.

Text:
To obtain efficient rISC, a narrow EST is required.3 A large spinorbit coupling is also 
essential, and is achieved through introducing a manifold of partially delocalised triplet states 
of both locallyexcited (LE) and chargetransfer (CT) character.3,6,9,10 Structurally, this has 
translated to ICT molecules built up of numerous weakly coupled chromophores, conjugated 
through twisted bonds andor cross conjugation. Prominent examples are 5CzTRZ and TAT
3DBTO2 reported by Cui, Chen, Adachi and Friend et al.6 and by Bryce, Monkman and co
workers,5 respectively (Figure 1a).
