Description:
A versatile bilayered phase capable of hosting various cations like lithium, sodium, manganese, and zinc.

Text:
The 
bilayered V2O5 phase (V2O5) is particularly versatile due to its ability to host a variety of 
cations, such as lithium, sodium, manganese, or zinc.5,6 It can further be synthesized by several 
wetchemical and hydrothermal methods, yielding a wide variety of attainable morphologies.7 
Thus, the material is suitable as a model system to explore electrochemical intercalation 
properties as a function of the host material structure and particularly its interlayer spacing. An emerging concept to reduce kinetic limitations in host materials is the direct tuning of 
lattice parameters, such as the interlayer spacing of layered and twodimensional materials, 
thereby modifying the nanoconfinement geometry within the host.

Description:
A material where interlayer expansion can be explored via ionic or molecular pillaring approaches.

Text:
Such tuning can be 
achieved via different functionalization approaches, including the insertion of pillarsspacer 
molecules into the host material structure.8,9 It has been hypothesized that the resulting 
increased interlayer spacing in a layered intercalation host electrode can increase the ionic 
diffusion due to a reduced activation energy barrier for ion hopping between interstitial 
vacancy sites,10 thereby allowing increased intercalation rates. In the case of V2O5, interlayer expansion was explored via ionic andor molecular pillaring 
approaches. Clites et al.
