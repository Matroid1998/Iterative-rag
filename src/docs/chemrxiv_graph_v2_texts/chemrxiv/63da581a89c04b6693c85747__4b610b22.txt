1).4 In that work, 
we reported a family of dicationic Pcontaining Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as A (Fig. 1) which displays 
three stable redox states including a radical cation. In contrast to MV, which are poorly luminescent, their intense 
luminescence was used in electrofluorochromic devices emitting in both the visible and near infrared domains.5 This 
illustrated that the Weitzstrategy adapted to Pderivatives is an original way to obtain intrinsically switchable electroactive 
fluorophores6 and overcome some limitations of widely used compounds such as MV. In order to prepare similar fluorophores 
which properties could be addressed upon oxidation (rather than reduction, as for A), a stable bisylide linked by an even 
number of sp2 C has to be prepared according to general formula displayed in Fig. 1.
