Description:
Zirconocene and hafnocene complexes synthesized with observed ZrHfHB interactions.

Their activation has 
established new grounds for producing valueadded molecules that reduce energy consumption 
and undesirable wastes.26 Among them, BH bond activation through agostic interaction has 
attracted immense attention. The hydridic nature of the H atom of BH bond discriminates it 
from the protic H of NH and covalent CH bonds. Forster et al.27 identified MHB activation 
as agostic interaction during the experimental characterization of zirconocene amidoborane 
complexes. A year later, Wolstenholme et al.28 reported the structure and bonding analysis of 
titanocene amidoborane complexes through AIM analysis to characterize the observed TiHB 
interactions. In 2012, Jacobs et al.29 synthesized several amido and imidoborane zirconocene and 
hafnocene complexes, where they observed ZrHfHB interactions.
