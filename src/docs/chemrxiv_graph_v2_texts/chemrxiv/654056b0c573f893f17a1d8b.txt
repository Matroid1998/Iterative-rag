Description:
Adsorption capacity for Cu2 ions from seawater is enhanced after MPs are weathered by UV irradiation.

Text:
Besides, biofilms formed on 
MPs can promote their uptake of heavy meals due to the much 
greater abundance of functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, amino, and 
phenylOH) within the biofilms, which often show higher affinity 
for heavy metals 18, 24. It was also reported that the adsorption 
capacity of four aged MPs for copper (Cu2) and Cd2 ions from 
seawater was remarkedly enhanced after being weathered by Ul
traviolet (UV) irradiation for 3 months 25. However, most of the 
above studies focused on marine environments or sewage treat
ment scenarios 26.
