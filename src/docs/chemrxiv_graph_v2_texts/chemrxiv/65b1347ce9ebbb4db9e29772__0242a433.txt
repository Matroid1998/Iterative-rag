Description:
Ligands commonly found in coordination compounds.

Text:
Since the formulation of the structures of coordination compounds containing metal complex 
ions by Alfred Werner around 1893, they have attracted much interest for researchers. These 
complexes are made up of metal captions surrounded by several anionic or neutral ligands. These 
ligands are most Schiff bases. Among the Schiff base compounds, the hydrazones. Hydrazones with the general formula R1R2CNNCR3 (1), come from the condensation 
between hydrazine and carbonyl compounds (ketones or aldehydes) (2), (3). Furthermore, ferrocene belonging to the family of metallocenes with general formula (5C5H5)2 
Fe, between two parallel cyclopentadienyl ligands (4) is nowadays added to hydrazone 
complexes (FcCHNNHR1) being the subject of much study by researchers. This is due to 
their applications in several fields. Among these compounds are those with electrochemical 
properties (5).
