Description:
Exhibits high rate behavior for electrochemical lithiation when preintercalated with Mg2.

Text:
studied the chemical preintercalation of different sized alkali and 
alkalineearth ions as simple ionic pillars, resulting in a variation of the interlayer spacing 
between 0.96  1.34 nm.11 The material with the largest initial interlayer spacing (V2O5 pre
intercalated with Mg2) was found to exhibit the highest rate behavior for the electrochemical 
lithiation reaction.11 Wei et al. preintercalated V2O5 with Fe3ions, which in turn improved 
the kinetics and stability of the electrochemical sodium intercalation reaction compared to 
pristine V2O5. The authors attribute the effect to a large reduction in electrochemo
