Description:
Involved in sensing processes that rely on accessible triplet excited states.

Text:
Phosphorescent complexes have also been explored as sensors in oxygen 
sensing,15 metal ion detection,16 biomolecule detection,17 and temperature sensing.18 Indeed, 
both oxygen and temperature sensing rely in particular on accessible triplet excited states of the 
sensor.

Description:
Acts as a target for ratiometric sensing in TADF emitters and polymers.

Text:
subsequently reported a series of carbazole
substituted dicyanobenzene and diphenylaminesubstituted anthraquinone donoracceptor (DA) 
TADF emitters, such as compound a3 (Figure 1a), for use as oxygen and temperature sensors.29 
In doped films, these dyes exhibit a temperature sensitivity in the investigated temperature range 
(278323 K), showing a 1.4 to 3.7 K1 change of the delayed lifetime, compared to that at 298 
K.29 Tonge et al. disclosed a TADF polymer, PTZODA (Figure 1a), which acts as a single
component ratiometric oxygen sensor.30 In addition to oxygen and temperature sensors, Li et al. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20234tdtfv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000171836022 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
