Description:
A compound synthesized on a kg-scale starting from a chiral epoxide.

For example, compound 1 is used in the synthesis of the C20C26 fragment of 
the anticancer drug  Halaven.10,11 A kgscale synthesis of the bicyclic ketone, (1R,5S)
bicyclo3.1.0hexan2one (3), has been reported and this synthetic method begins with the chiral 
epoxide 1 (Scheme 1).12 In this transformation, the chiral epoxide is reacted with catalytic lithium 
2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidide (TMP) which allows insertion into the olefin group to provide the

bicyclic alcohol (2). Oxidation of the alcohol gives compound 3 as the single enantiomer.
