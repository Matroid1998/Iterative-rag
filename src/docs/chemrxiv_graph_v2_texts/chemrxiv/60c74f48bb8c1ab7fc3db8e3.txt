Description:
A bond that is hydrolyzed by protease to generate a carboxylic acid and amine.

Text:
Once the polypeptide is bound within the active site of the protease, the scissile amide 
bond is hydrolyzed to generate a carboxylic acid and amine (Figure 1A). The binding pockets of a 
protease are referred to as subsites, denoted by S. Typically, each subsite interacts with a specific side 
chain of the polypeptide substrate, denoted by P. The position at which the polypeptide substrate is 
cleaved determines the assignment of prime or noprime notation. Prime notation refers to the Cterminal 
side and noprime notation refers to the Nterminal side of the polypeptide and corresponding pockets 
(Figure 1B). 3
