Description:
Produces characteristic spectral fingerprints due to long-range crystalline and short-range molecular vibrations.

Text:
For the carbonbased materials, the Raman spectroscopy is a particularly wellsuited technique (Zhang et al., 
2022), due to the longrange crystalline vibrations and shortrange molecular vibrations of carbon species, which 
are producing, for the different materials, their characteristic spectral fingerprints. According to Zhang and 
coworkers, these fingerprints allow identifying the specific carbon materials including graphite, diamond, graphene, 
carbon nanotubes, fullerene, and amorphous carbon. To these materials, we must also add the recent studies on 
graphene, bilayer graphene, and twodimensional graphene heterostructures (Zhang et al., 2022, Mu and Sun, 
2020, Cui and Sun, 2021). We have already discussed diamond and graphite Raman spectra in the framework of their decomposition in q
Gaussian Tsallis functions.
