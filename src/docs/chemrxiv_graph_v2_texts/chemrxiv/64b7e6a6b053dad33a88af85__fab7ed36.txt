Description:
A component of ternary C2H2C2H6C2H4 mixtures that is challenging to trap selectively.

Text:
Because of the difficulty in designing and 
synthesizing materials that preferentially trap C2H2 and C2H6, 
simultaneous removal of both C2H2 and C2H6 from ternary 
C2H2C2H6C2H4 mixtures in a onestep process is still under
explored. Besides, the reported MOF and HOF adsorbents 
generally suffer from poor chemical stability, high cost and 
unscalable products, which hamper their practical applications. Thus, 
developing 
inexpensive 
and 
chemically 
robust 
adsorbents with excellent C2gases mixture separation 
properties is urgently needed for the industrial purification of 
C2H4.
