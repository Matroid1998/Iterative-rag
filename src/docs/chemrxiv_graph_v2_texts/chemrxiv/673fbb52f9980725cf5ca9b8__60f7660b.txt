Description:
A dynamic RNA modification required for RNAs to adopt their 3D structures and perform normal biological functions.

Text:
As a result, standard RNA synthesis methods cannot be used to 
synthesize RNAs containing sensitive epitranscriptomic modifications as well as artificially designed 
sensitive functional groups.911 An example of sensitive RNA modifications is N4acetylcytidine (ac4C).12
13 It was first discovered in tRNAs14 and later rRNAs,15 where it is typically static under normal biological 
conditions, and is required for the RNAs to adopt their 3D structures for normal function. More recently, it 
was also discovered in mRNAs16 and even regulatory RNAs such as lncRNA,17 where it is typically 
dynamic, and being dynamic is needed for its intended biological functions. Errors related to ac4C are
