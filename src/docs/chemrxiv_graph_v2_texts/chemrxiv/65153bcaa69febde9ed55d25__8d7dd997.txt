Description:
The hardest known material with a Vickers hardness of 100 GPa and density of 3.635 g/cmÂ³, formed by sp3-hybridized carbon atoms.

Diamond is the hardest known material with a Vickers hardness (HV) at the level of 100 GPa and 
density   3.635 gcm3 1. Its structure (space group Fm3m) is formed by cornersharing tetrahedra 
of sp3hybridized carbon atoms with CCC  109.47 and is characterized by the highest atomic 
density (i.e., the number of atoms per unit cell volume) and the highest density per valence electron 
2. A rare hexagonal form of diamond (lonsdaleite) (space group P63mmc) with virtually the same 
density has been claimed to be stronger and stiffer than diamond 3. The network topologies of diamond and lonsdaleite are dia and lon, respectively, and many 
theoretically predicted carbon allotropes have been identified with these topologies (see 4 and 
references therein).

Description:
Has superior atomic density, elastic moduli, and hardness.

The topology determination for the new phases is now made easy with the 
TopCryst program 5. Information on all carbon allotropes extracted from the literature is indexed in 
the SACADA database 6, which currently contains 703 allotropes. Diamond (both cubic and hexagonal) is still considered to have superior atomic density, elastic moduli 
and hardness 1. Recently, however, several superdense (  3.635 gcm3) carbon allotropes have 
been predicted from the firstprinciples studies 7,8, and hexagonal (space group P6222) C3 with 
assigned quartz topology (SACADA qtz 11) has even been claimed to have a hardness of 113 GPa 
8, i.e., 15 harder than diamond. Also, very recently superdense (  3.666 gcm3) ultrahard (HV  
102 GPa) hexagonal C6 (space group P6522) allotrope with qtz topology was proposed by us 9.
