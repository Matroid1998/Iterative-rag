Description:
A gas that can be adsorbed by cellulose-MOF functional materials.

Text:
Porous materials 1,2 such as Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) 320 and zeolitic imidazolate 
frameworks (ZIFs) are hybrid porous materials consisting of metal ions connected with organic 
linkers 2138. Processing MOFs using template materials gives rise to a new class of mixed 
materials that combines the advantages of both components 2126. In recent years, hybridizing 
biopolymers such as cellulose with MOFs has resulted in the development of celluloseMOF 
functional materials, which opens up vast new advantages in terms of high performance, good 
processability, and good sustainability 26. CelluloseMOFs have thereby several advanced 
applications, for instance, drug delivery 40,41, carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption 42, water 
remediation 4345, thermal insulation, and fire retardancy 46.
