Description:
Salts recognized for their role in cross-coupling reactions.

Text:
Drawbacks with these methods include the need for transition 
metal catalysts and long reaction times at elevated 
temperatures. Surprisingly, the literature is void of cross
coupling methods in the orthoposition, irrespective of whether 
the azobenzene moiety serves as organometallic nucleophilic 
component or as electrophilic halogenated crosscoupling 
partner,17 despite access to orthometalated azobenzenes.24 
Hypervalent iodine(III) compounds are efficient reagents for 
a wide range of transformations under mild reaction 
conditions.25 Diaryliodonium salts have been recognized as 
Scheme 1 Orthosubstituted azobenzenes. a. Department of Organic Chemistry, Arrhenius Laboratory
