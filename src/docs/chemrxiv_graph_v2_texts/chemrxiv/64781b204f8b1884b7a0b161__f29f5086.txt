Description:
A photocatalyst used for light-driven aerobic oxidative degradation of organic pollutants.

In general, the complexity of various factors influencing the performance of photocatalysts 
modified with cocatalyst can be well exemplified on TiO2based photocatalysts for lightdriven 
aerobic oxidative degradation of organic pollutants. It has been suggested by Gerischer and 
Heller already more than thirty years ago3b, 16 and later confirmed by detailed mechanistic 
studies17 that the kinetics of photocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules at TiO2 particles is 
typically limited by the rate of oxygen reduction by photogenerated electrons which is 
significantly slower (by several orders of magnitude) than the oxidation of organic molecules 
by photogenerated holes. A faster consumption of photogenerated electrons by catalytically 
enhancing the rate of their reaction with dioxygen reduction is therefore expected to lead to
