Description:
Used to modify CuTDPAT in the presence of Pd nanoparticles.

Text:
Due to the hingelike 
connectivity between the metal and ligand, the material normally transitions from a large pore 
to a narrow pore structure upon solvent removal; however, the added polymer induced reticular 
stiffness, thereby inhibiting the narrow pore transition.11 In other studies, it was demonstrated 
that the introduction of oligomers, which have a high density of Lewis base functionality on 
their backbone, can help stabilize metal nanoparticles (NPs) grown inside MOF pores;1415 this 
can extend the catalyst lifetime when compared to MOFNP composite excluding the polymer. These reports show that the eventual degradation of the composite catalyst is correlated with 
the decomposition of the MOF structure itself, which, in turn, allows the release and
