Description:
A calcium-containing salt used in titration to form homogenous solutions.

Text:
The principle
34
of this setup is based on titrating an aqueous solution of a salt containing one ion (e.g., carbonate,
35
Na2CO3), with a solution containing the second ion (e.g., calcium, CaCl2) to create a supersaturated,
36
homogenous solution of the phase of interest (CaCO3 in this example). Based on this titrimetric method,
37
several crystallization studies of a range of minerals, including Ca(OH)2 and CSH, were designed to
38
improve the understanding of the crystallization mechanism and enlighten the influence of additives in
39
this process 26, 27, 28, 29. These studies revealed that a nonclassical crystallization pathway (i.e.,

the formation of amorphous prenucleation clusters that condense to crystal nuclei instead of classical
