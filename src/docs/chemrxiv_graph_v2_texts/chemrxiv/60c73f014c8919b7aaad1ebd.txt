Description:
Used in antimicrobial polymer foil with silver-doped tricalcium phosphate nanoparticles.

Text:
Due to their potential to increase the material 
surface area, e.g. in highly catalytic gold nanoparticles, enhance antibacterial material 
properties, e.g. in antimicrobial polymer foil with silverdoped tricalcium phosphate 
nanoparticles, improve the hardness of a material, e.g., in nanocomposites, affect the electron 
band gap of materials, e.g., in solar cells, augment electric properties, e.g., in nanofilled 
coatings, alter magnetic properties, e.g., magnetic separation, enable drug delivery, e.g., in 
drug nanocarriers, these materials allow for a wide range of applications.6,7 The possibilities 
to design different nanomaterials are vast, and consequently, computational methods are now 
routinely being employed in order to predict and design novel nanoparticles before they are 
tested experimentally.
