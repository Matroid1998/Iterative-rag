Aziridines, recognized as the smallest nitrogencontaining 
heterocyclic compounds, are a privileged scaffold 
extensively found in natural products and pharmaceuticals, 
such as Mitomycin A (antitumor agents), Azicemicin A 
(antimicrobial antibiotic) and FR66979 (antitumor 
antibiotic) (Scheme 1a).16 Notably, as a crucial building 
block, various methods for synthesizing aziridines have 
emerged.510 These primarily include 1) intramolecular 
cyclization of amino or azido alcohols. 2) addition of 
carbene equivalent to imine.8 3) addition of nitrene 
equivalent to olefin.9 Transforming simple olefins into high
valueadded aziridines, given that the significance of olefins 
as a chemical feedstock, represents a challenging and 
significant task.

Produced from alkenes through transient oxaziridines.

Conversely, the synthesis of free NH 
aziridines has garnered relatively less attention, probably 
due to the scarcity of suitable nitrene precursors and 
approaches.1116 In a seminal study in 2014, the Krti, Falck, 
and Ess group reported a rhodiumcatalyzed NH 
aziridination 
of 
alkenes 
utilizing 
O(2,4
dinitrophenyl)hydroxylamines (DPHs) as the aminating 
reagent (Scheme 1c, left).13 They later extended this 
approach to include both NH and Nalkyl aziridination of 
olefins, using hydroxylamineOsulfonic acids (HOSA) as 
nitrene precursors alongside Rhodium(II) dimer catalyst 
and pyridine as base.14a Subsequently, Krtis group has 
advanced the field by demonstrating enantioselective 
aziridination 
using 
commercially 
available 
()3
(trifluoroacetyl)camphor as a chiral catalyst, producing 
aziridines 
from 
simple 
alkenes 
through 
transient 
oxaziridines formed in situ from HOSA and electron
deficient ketones aziridination of alkenes, (Scheme 1c, 
middle).15 Most recently, the Jat and Tiwari groups also 
reported a metalfree intermolecular NH using
