Description:
A clean, energy-dense fuel that does not produce greenhouse gases when produced or burned.

Text:
Green hydrogen offers a promising alternative to fossil fuels, since it is clean, energydense,
and does not produce any greenhouse gases when produced or when burned.1 However,
green hydrogens economic viability depends on the discovery of cheaper and more efficient
catalysts.2 A large challenge in discovering these novel catalysts lies in the enormous chemical
space of potential candidates.3 Conventional experimental methods require the synthesis,
characterization, and assessment of new structures, which is a very timeintensive process
that is neither able to completely cover the vast chemical space nor do so in a reasonable
amount of time.4 To overcome this challenge, computational approaches have been employed
since certain material properties, like electronic energy, can be correlated with catalytic
activity.
