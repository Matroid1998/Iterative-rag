Description:
A precatalyst used in Ni-catalyzed electrochemical aryl amination reactions.

Text:
Aryl amination C(sp2)N crosscoupling reactions are highly valuable and widely used in 
organic synthesis as anilinetype functional groups are ubiquitously present in drugs and natural 
products.14 In 2017, Baran and coworkers reported Nicatalyzed electrochemical aryl amination 
reactions (eamination) between (hetero)aromatic halidetriflate electrophiles and aliphatic amine 
nucleophiles in the presence of a NiBr2.DME precatalyst and 4,4ditertbutyl2,2dipyridyl 
(dtbbpy) ligand (Scheme 1).5 Later, Baran advanced this aryl eamination to amino acid, 
oligopeptides, and nucleoside nucleophiles by using benchstable Ni(bpy)3Br2 catalyst and DBU 
base.6 More recently, Ruepings group further extended the substrate scope of this aryl eamination 
to electronrich aryl halidetriflate electrophiles and weak Nnucleophiles such as aniline, 
sulfonamide, sulfoximine, carbamate, and imine through adjusting the strength of the base.7 
Mechanistic studies by Baran and coworkers using UVVis spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, 
and DFT calculations suggested a NiIIII catalytic pathway outlined in Scheme 1.6 In this proposed 
catalytic cycle, a cathodic reduction generated a LNiIBr species that directly undergoes oxidative 
addition with the aryl halide to form a NiIII aryl intermediate, LNiIII(Ar)Br2, which is rapidly 
transformed into a stable LNiII(Ar)Br intermediate via facile comproportionation with NiI 
species or through cathodic reduction.
