Introduction
This research papers hypothesis is that the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) will
increase with the use of the catalysts of MnO2, PbO2, and Fe2O3, with MnO2 having the highest
catalytic activity and inhibiting the fastest rate of decomposition of Hydrogen peroxide, measured with
the fastest rate of oxygen production.

Description:
A chemical compound commonly used as a disinfectant and bleaching agent.

Text:
The increase of temperature from 0C to 90C will enhance the rate
of decomposition for each catalyst, with the most significant increase observed at 60C and 90C,
observed in each catalyst. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a chemical compound commonly used as a disinfectant and bleaching
agent. It decomposes naturally into water (H2O) and oxygen gas (O2), as shown in the reaction
2H2O2(aq)2H2O(l)O2(g)
This decomposition reaction is generally slow at room temperature over an extended period1, but can be
significantly accelerated by the presence of catalysts and increased temperatures. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the
process. Catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, thus
increasing the reaction rate.

Description:
Undergoes decomposition that can be accelerated by catalysts.

Text:
In the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, several catalysts can be used to
accelerate the reaction

Manganese dioxide (MnO2) A wellknown and highly effective catalyst2 for the decomposition
of HO. It is often used in practical demonstrations to display catalytic activity due to its strong
catalytic effect.3
