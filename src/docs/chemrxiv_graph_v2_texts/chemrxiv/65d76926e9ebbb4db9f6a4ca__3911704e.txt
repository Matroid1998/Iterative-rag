dimethylformamide (DMF), the nitrogen is planar and 
the methyl groups are inequivalent due to significant 
CN double bond character, whereas in the heavier 
P,Pdimethylformylphosphine the phosphorus moiety 
is pyramidal and there is minimal donation of the 
lone pair into the CO  orbital (Figure 1C).3

functional group in organic chemistry, and can be 
found in dyes and pharmaceuticals, such as the anti
