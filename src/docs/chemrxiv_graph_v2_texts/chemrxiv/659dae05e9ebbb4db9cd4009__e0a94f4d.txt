Description:
Used in successful addition chemistry developed by the laboratory.

However, in our experiments we 
did not observe reactivity of butadiene or equivalents (e.g. sul
folene) in 42 cycloaddition with 9 under a variety of condi
tions.9 With these observations in hand, together with the suc
cessful silyloxy benzopyrylium addition chemistry developed 
by our laboratory,10 we changed our approach to evaluate an in
direct pathway to construct the twokey CC bonds (Scheme 
1A). We envisioned altering our previously employed si
loxybenzopyrylium generation protocol to prepare an activated 
allyloxybenzopyrylium reagent. To implement this approach, 
we evaluated use of in situprepared allyl triflate11 to replace 
trialkylsilyl triflates for activation of chromone ester 9. We rea
soned that if allyl triflate can activate the protected chromone 
ester, then allyloxy chromenone 12 could be generated directly 
without intermediacy of siloxy chromenone 14.
