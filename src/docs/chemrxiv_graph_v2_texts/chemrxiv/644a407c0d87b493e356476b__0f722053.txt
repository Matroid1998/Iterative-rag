Description:
A nitrogen-based fertilizer produced through the Haber-Bosch process from atmospheric nitrogen.

Text:
Ammonia (NH3) is a nitrogenbased fertilizer produced through the 
58 
HaberBosch process from atmospheric N. Meanwhile, P is produced from phosphate rock, 
59 
which is a nonrenewable and limited resource. Moreover, the increasing demand for fertilizer 
60 
might lead to exhaustion of the global P resources in the upcoming years. Thus, treatment and 
61 
nutrient recovery from WW not only aids in preventing the contamination of freshwater 
62 
resources but also abets recovering P thereby achieving sustainable development goal (SDG) 6
