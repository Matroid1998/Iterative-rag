Description:
A substrate in the TIM-catalyzed isomerization to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

Text:
10 of all enzymes.19 These observations have placed TIM at the forefront of 
enzymes targeted for mechanistic studies, because of the strong possibility that the results of 
studies on TIM will lead to conclusions that are broadly generalizable to other protein catalysts.20 

Scheme 1. The mechanism of TIMcatalyzed isomerization of Dglyceraldehyde 3phosphate 
(GAP) to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). Computational studies on TIM have been pursued vigorously,36, 810, 13, 2137 because of their 
potential to provide a description of the events at the enzyme active site not accessible to 
examination by experimental studies.
