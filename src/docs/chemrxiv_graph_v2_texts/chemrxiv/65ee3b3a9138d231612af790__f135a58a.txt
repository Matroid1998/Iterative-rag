Description:
Produced through rhodium-catalyzed NH aziridination of alkenes.

Conversely, the synthesis of free NH 
aziridines has garnered relatively less attention, probably 
due to the scarcity of suitable nitrene precursors and 
approaches.1116 In a seminal study in 2014, the Krti, Falck, 
and Ess group reported a rhodiumcatalyzed NH 
aziridination 
of 
alkenes 
utilizing 
O(2,4
dinitrophenyl)hydroxylamines (DPHs) as the aminating 
reagent (Scheme 1c, left).13 They later extended this 
approach to include both NH and Nalkyl aziridination of 
olefins, using hydroxylamineOsulfonic acids (HOSA) as 
nitrene precursors alongside Rhodium(II) dimer catalyst 
and pyridine as base.14a Subsequently, Krtis group has 
advanced the field by demonstrating enantioselective 
aziridination 
using 
commercially 
available 
()3
(trifluoroacetyl)camphor as a chiral catalyst, producing 
aziridines 
from 
simple 
alkenes 
through 
transient 
oxaziridines formed in situ from HOSA and electron
deficient ketones aziridination of alkenes, (Scheme 1c, 
middle).15 Most recently, the Jat and Tiwari groups also 
reported a metalfree intermolecular NH using
