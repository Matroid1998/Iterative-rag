Description:
Undergoes depolymerisation to C2F4 and related low molecular weight fluorocarbons by vacuum pyrolysis.

Text:
Depolymerisation of PTFE to C2F4 (and related low molecular weight fluorocarbons) by vacuum 
pyrolysis is an energy intensive process; at 510 C the halflife of conversion of PTFE to monomers has 
been estimated as  30 min.2 Although this provides a viable route for reprocessing of PTFE, it is not 
an effective approach to recycle this material in any other way. In this regard, defluorination holds
