Description:
A fluorophore commonly used in guided surgery.

In clinical settings, fluorophores like indocyanine green (ICG) and 
methylene blue (MB) are commonly used in guided surgery.9,10 Once again, the advantages of the NIR region are 
evident, as low scattering and absorption are accompanied by weak autofluorescence from proteins, amino acids, 
vitamins, and other biomolecules present in different tissue compartments.1 For instance, the autofluorescence of 
blood can serve as a biomarker for various diseases.11 However, in the context of fluorescence sensing with 
exogenous fluorophores, it produces an interfering background, lowering the SNR and impairing the limit of 
detection. Therefore, its of great interest to design fluorophores with emission wavelengths in the NIR range.2 Quantum 
dots12,13, upconversion nanoparticles14 or singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)15 can serve this purpose. SWCNTs can be conceptualized as a rolledup single layer of graphene.
