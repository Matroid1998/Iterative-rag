Isoelectronic with two carbon atoms and exists in four polymorphic modifications: two graphitelike (hexagonal and rhombohedral) and two dense (cubic and wurtzite).

An enormous number of polytype crystal structures are known for silicon carbide, SiC, with the 
most well known being cfc 6H (P63mc) moissanite. The cfc topology is also adopted by 
hexagonal carbon allotrope C8, called 4C carbon 4, which is used here to create new BN and 
BC2N structures. BN is isoelectronic with two carbon atoms BN(8e)  2C(8e) (e  electron) and is known to exist in 
four polymorphic modifications two graphitelike, hexagonal (P63mm) (hBN) and rhombohedral 
(R3m) (rBN), and two dense, cubic (F43m) (cBN) and wurtzite (P63mc) (wBN), which are close 
analogs of the main carbon allotropes (hexagonal and rhombohedral graphite, diamond and 
lonsdaleite). BN it is also isoelectronic with SiC BN(8e)  SiC(8e). The eight electrons belong to 
the outer shells, i.e.

2s2, 2pn for the second period elements B, C, N (n  1, 2 and 3, respectively) 
and 3s2, 3p2 for the third period element Si. It should be noted that for boron nitride mainly sp2bonded polytypes are known, which are 
characterized by different layer stacking sequences (e.g. AAAA for hexagonal BN, ABCABC for 
rhombohedral BN, etc.) 5. In our work results on new hexagonal sp3bonded BN polytypes and 
BC2N with cfc topology are presented. The studies of the structures of the new phases based on 
crystallochemical engineering are supported by data on their stability, mechanical and dynamic 
properties, and structure of electronic bands, all calculated in the quantum mechanics framework of 
the Density Functional Theory (DFT) 6,7.
