Description:
A unit involved in the formation of lignin through radical coupling reactions.

The excessive use of fossil resources contributes to environmental pollution that is 
suspected to be the main reason of global warming.1 It is highly relevant to find 

alternative renewable energy sources to mitigate global warming, which can commit 
over onethird of the Earths animal and plant species into extinction within 25 years.2 
Lignocellulosic biomass has received significant interest in recent years due to its 
potential application as second generation biofuels and CO2neutral renewable 
feedstock for platform chemicals and materials.36 Lignin, being one of the three main 
constituents of the plant cell walls is the largest available biomass of aromatic 
compounds.7 However, it is a great challenge to produce monomers from natural or 
technical lignins due to their extremely complex, threedimensional and crosslinked 
structure formed mainly by the radical coupling reactions of monolignols which are p
hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units (Scheme 1).811 In fact, there 
are hundreds of research articles dedicated to the structural characterization of 
different lignin compounds using various chromatographic or spectroscopic 
techniques.1214
