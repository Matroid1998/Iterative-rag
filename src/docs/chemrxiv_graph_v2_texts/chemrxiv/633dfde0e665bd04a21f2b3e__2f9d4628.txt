Description:
Plays an important role in stabilizing early stage NPF clusters against evaporation.

Text:
New particle formation (NPF) is responsible for the birth of approximately 50 of aerosol
particles formed in the atmosphere,1 and results from the clustering of low volatility gaseous
vapors.2 Acidbase chemistry and salt bridge formation play an important role in stabi
lizing early stage NPF clusters against evaporation, allowing these clusters to grow into
atmospherically relevant sizes.39 Sulfuric acid  ammonia ( water) clusters have previously
been studied in depth1015 as these particles make up a majority of postindustrial revolu
tion NPF contributors.16 However, in midlatitude coastal and polar regional NPF events,
H2SO4  NH3( H2O) cluster formation rates alone could not account for observed NPF
rates.17,18 Further investigation into these regional events led to the discovery that the pres
ence of iodine in these regions helps fuel these NPF events.1922 Coastal algae and other
biota release I2,2326 HOI,27,28 and various organoiodide species, such as CH2I2,20,21,2931
at low tide, which can form various iodine oxoacids23,3236 and iodine oxides19,22,31,32,3742
through photolysis and photooxidation.
