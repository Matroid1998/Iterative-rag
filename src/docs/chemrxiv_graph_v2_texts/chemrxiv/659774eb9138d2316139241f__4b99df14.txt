Description:
A metal oxide material used as a particulate heterogeneous catalyst to improve conversion rates and efficiency.

Text:
Particulate heterogeneous catalysts composed of metal oxide materials such as ZnO, 
Al2O3, or multimetal oxides are often packed inside the discharge region of the reactor to 
improve both conversion rates and efficiency.9,17,18 The catalyst structure is commonly a 
distribution of chemicallysynthesized catalyst particles either packed into the plasma volume or 
deposited onto an inert foam, wool, or bead support material.
