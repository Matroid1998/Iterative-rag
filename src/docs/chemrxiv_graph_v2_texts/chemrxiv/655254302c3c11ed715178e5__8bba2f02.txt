Description:
Halogen bond donors, like polarized iodine atoms, are used in anion receptors.

Text:
Anions, due to their ubiquity and technological and biological relevance, constitute important targets for the construction of molecular 
receptors capable of their capture, sensing, and transport.1 To ensure efficient binding, anion receptors are typically equipped with strong 
hydrogen bond donors (NH, OH),2 halogen bond donors (e.g. polarized I atoms),3,4 or positively charged groups,5,6 which are known to 
strongly interact with anions. CHbased anion receptors are inherently weaker, but offer unique selectivity, high stability, and 
lipophilicity, which make them appealing for certain applications. 7 , 8 In particular, their lipophilic nature and high resistance to 
deprotonation make them promising candidates for transmembrane anion carriers.9,10,11

interactions are marked with green).
