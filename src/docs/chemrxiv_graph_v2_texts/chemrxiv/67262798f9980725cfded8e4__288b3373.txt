Description:
Referenced as a reversible electrode potential in electrochemical evaluations.

Further 
TEM images confirm the discrete nature of the Cu23 NCs and 
its consistent size even after loading on the CB surface 
(Figures 
4bc). This 
consistent 
structural 
feature 
underscores the preservation of the Cu23 NCs structural 
integrity during the electrode fabrication process, crucial 
for its performance as a CO2RR catalyst. The electrochemical performance of Cu23 NC was 
thoroughly evaluated across a range of constant voltages, 
specifically from 0.6 to 1.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen 
electrode (RHE). This evaluation was conducted using CO2
saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution as the electrolyte 
within a gasflow Htype cell setup. Following the 
electrochemical 
testing, 
an 
indepth 
analysis 
was 
performed utilizing gas chromatography (GC) and 1H NMR 
to characterize the gas and liquid products, respectively.

Description:
A product generated during CO2RR.

Text:
Our results indicated that hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and formic acid (HCOOH) were the products 
generated during the CO2RR (Figure 4d and Figure S11). To 
verify that these products originated from the flowing CO2, 
a control experiment was carried out using constant
potential electrolysis in an argon (Ar) atmosphere instead 
of CO2. The absence of CO2RR products at all tested 
potentials in the Ar atmosphere confirmed that the detected 
products were indeed derived from CO2 and not from any 
other source (Figure S12). The Faradaic efficiency (FE) data 
demonstrated a significant increase in total efficiency with 
increasing potential, rising from 8 at 0.6 V to 74 at 1.4 
V (Figure 4d). Initially, at 0.6 V, no CO2RR products were 
obtained.

Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction, remaining nearly constant at 1.2 V.

Text:
The formation of HCOOH and a small amount of 
CO was first observed at 0.8 V. As the potential became 
more negative (from 1.0 V to 1.4 V), the selectivity for 
HCOOH 
increased 
significantly, 
reaching 
saturation 
(FEHCOOH 26) at 1.2 V, where hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER) was nearly at constant. Beyond 1.2 V, the 
formation of CO is increasing with the increasing potential 
where the HER and FEHCOOH are almost constant. To evaluate 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
material 
under 
the 
applied 
electrochemical conditions, we identified the constant 
current densities at each voltage for one hour duration 
(Figure 4e). Chronoamperometric measurements were 
then conducted at 1.0 V for a period of 6 hours to determine 
the materials practical applicability (Figure S13).
