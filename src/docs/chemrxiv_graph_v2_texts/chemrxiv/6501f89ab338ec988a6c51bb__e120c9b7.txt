Description:
A carbon signaling molecule detected using activity-based sensing methods.

Text:
We envisioned that 
activitybased sensing (ABS), which leverages the intrinsic 
chemical reactivity of an analyte for its selective and sensitive 
detection,13,14 could present a complementary strategy for for
mate analysis that is compatible with live cells and can provide 
spatiotemporal information regarding onecarbon metabolic 
flux.13,14,15,16 As part of a growing field to discover and decipher 
the chemical roles that dynamic onecarbon metabolites play at 
a cellular level, our laboratory and others have developed ABS 
methods 
for 
carbon 
monoxide,17,18,19 
formalde
hyde,16,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 and carbon dioxide,14,23,28 as well as re
lated carbon signaling molecules such as ethylene.29,30,31,32,33,34 
Here, we report an organometallic ABS method for detection of 
biological formate using a twocomponent system, where for
matemediated iridium transfer hydrogenation (TH) catalysis 
enables aldehydetoalcohol reduction on fluorophore scaffolds 
accompanied by a fluorescence response (Figure 1).
