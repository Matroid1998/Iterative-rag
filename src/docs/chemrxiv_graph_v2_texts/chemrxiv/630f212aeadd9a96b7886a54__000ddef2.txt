Description:
A panNOS inhibitor proposed as a therapeutic against TNBC.

Moreover, NO was found to promote the progression of cancer via the 
activation of certain oncogenic signalling pathways. This is responsible for the enhancement of cancer 
cell proliferation and migration alongside their resistance to various chemotherapeutics as summarized 
by Switzer et al., 2011. Hence, iNOS inhibitors have been proposed as effective therapeutics against 
TNBC (GranadosPrincipal et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016), with some recent clinical trials employing the 
panNOS inhibitor NGmonomethyllarginine (LNMMA) (Chung et al., 2021). However, the applications 
of these inhibitors still need further investigation.
