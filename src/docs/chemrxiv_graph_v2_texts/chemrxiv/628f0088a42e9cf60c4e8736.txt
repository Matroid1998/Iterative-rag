Description:
Represent an attractive choice for cross coupling due to their widespread commercial availability.

Such approaches have 
been highly impactful in the context of medicinal chemistry 
efforts, where expedient and modular access to a broad 
range of analogues is critical for exploring key biological 
hypotheses.17 For instance, the construction of potential 
drug candidates is often guided by the presence of C(sp2)
C(sp3) linkages, which are an essential motif in countless 
active pharmaceutical ingredients and are often a vector 
where SAR studies are performed with great diligence.18 
Therefore, the development of synthetic methods that give 
access to a vast swath of chemical space by merging two 
accessible and benchtopstable partners have attracted 
great attention. To this end, cross coupling partners such as 
carboxylic acids and aryl halides represent an attractive 
choice owing to their widespread commercial availability.
