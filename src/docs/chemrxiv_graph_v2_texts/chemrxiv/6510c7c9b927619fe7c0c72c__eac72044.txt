Description:
Used in the nucleophilic ring opening of aziridines for diversification.

Aziridines 
are 
valuable 
strained 
threemembered 
nitrogen containing heterocycles known for their utility as 
nitrogen building blocks.1 Chiral aziridines command an 
elevated level of interest as they serve as excellent chiral 
building blocks and intermediates for the stereoselective 
incorporation of nitrogen while allowing for downstream 
diversification through regio and stereoselective opening 
of the strained ring.24 Nucleophilic ring opening with or 
without Lewis acid activation is the most frequently 
employed method for aziridine diversification and can 
afford access to chiral amines, amino alcohols, amino acids, 
and other chiral nitrogen motifs.56 The ease with which 
chiral aziridines can be diversified has made them 
desirable targets and has driven the development of 
synthetic methods to access them in an expedient fashion.7

Stereoselective synthesis of aziridines can be achieved 
through three distinct synthetic disconnections 1) 
intramolecular condensation of chiral haloamines or 
amino alcohols, 2) stereoselective addition of carbon 
sources to imines, or 3) stereoselective addition of nitrene 
equivalents to alkenes.
