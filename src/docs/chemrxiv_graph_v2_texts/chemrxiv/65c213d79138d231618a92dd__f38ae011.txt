Description:
Polycrystalline ruthenium involved in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR).

Text:
In particular, for these
metals, it must be considered that the inter
action with the electrolyte and anions in the
electrolyte also plays a significant role, which
in turn can affect the potential dependent reac
tion characteristics. One metal that exhibits a
strong interaction with electrolytes is Ru. Numerous previous studies reported on the
ORR on polycrystalline Ru (Ru(pc)) elec
