Description:
Undergoes reduction to form H2O in the oxygen reduction reaction.

Text:
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) taking
place at the cathode of a fuel cell is consid
ered to play a major role in the energy loss
in such systems.1 Desirably, the reduction of
O2 proceeds to form H2O.24 However, an in
direct path that involves the formation of hy
drogen peroxide (H2O2), which can further re
act to H2O, is equally possible. Pt is the most
active pure elementary metal catalyst for the
ORR,4 and, therefore, also the most intensively
studied one for this reaction, including a vast
number of studies on welldefined singlecrystal
model electrodes and Ptbased materials.1,58
Much less is known about the reaction path
ways on metals that bind reaction intermedi
ates stronger than Pt.
