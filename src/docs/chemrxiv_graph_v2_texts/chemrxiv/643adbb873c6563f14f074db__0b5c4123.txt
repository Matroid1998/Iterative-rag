Description:
Used in the conversion of CO2 to methanol as part of a circular economy based on carbon recycling.

Text:
Transforming CO2 into valueadded products such as methanol, hydrocarbon fuels, and other
platform chemicals has gained attention as an attractive approach to reduce the negative im
pact carbon dioxide has on the climate.14 Using renewable energy and sustainable hydrogen
would allow us to establish a circular economy based on carbon recycling.1,2,58 However,
due to the stable nature of CO2, highly active, selective, and deactivationresistant cata
lysts are required to make largescale adaptation feasible.5 Various catalytic systems with
dierent combinations of active metal and supporting metal oxide have been prepared and
characterised to maximise catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 conversion to methanol

Oxidesupported Cu nanoparticles have been extensively studied for catalysing CTM
due to their promising methanol selectivity, which can be upwards of 60 .3,15 Several ex
perimental2,3,1620 and computational2,3,17,1922 studies have associated the catalytic activity
with active sites at the metaloxide interface.
