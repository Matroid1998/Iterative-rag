Description:
Compounds with inherent ring strain used in cycloaddition reactions.

Text:
Alternatively, an intermolecular cy
cloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs) and alkenes is 
highly desirable since it allows the efficient construction of 
bicyclic ring through the fusion of two readily available 
starting materials. Pioneering studies were disclosed by 
Blanchard5a in 1966 and De Meijere5b in 1986. Subsequently, 
Wipf group5c reported an intramolecular variant of this cy
cloaddition under thermal condition in 2006. More recently, by taking advantage of the ready availabil
ity and inherent ring strain of BCBs,6b,9 the exploration of 
new strategies to the cycloaddition between BCBs and al
kenes in the generation of various BCHs has attracted inten
sive attentions.68 According to the reported reaction pro
cesses, most methods could be categorized into two modes 
1) radical pathway; and 2) twoelectron pathway (Scheme 
1b).

Description:
A compound that can be activated as an enolate nucleophile upon central bond cleavage mediated by Lewis acid.

Meanwhile, Procter group applied SmI2 as a sin
gle electron reductant to achieve the insertion of electron
deficient alkene into BCB (Scheme 1b1).7b Very recently, 
Zheng group described a Ticatalyzed formal cycloaddition 
of BCB and 2azadienes to synthesize aminobicy
clo2.1.1hexanes.7e Lately, Glorius accomplished the cou
pling of phenol and BCB by leveraging a photoredox pro
cess.7d All the reactions above entailed the generation of 
radical species, which to some extent limited the substrate 
scope. Bicyclo1.1.0butanes could be activated as an enolate 
nucleophile upon central bond cleavage mediated by 
Lewis acid to attack electrophilic reagents such as aryl al
dimine by Leitch group,8a aldehyde by Glorius group,8c or 
ketene by Studer group,8b followed by the intramolecular 
cyclization to complete the formal cycloadditions.
