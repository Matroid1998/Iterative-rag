Description:
Foams that can be produced from polyol architectures derived from microalgae-based oil.

Text:
Microalgae are signicantly more producve 
than convenonal oil crops due to their considerable rapid growth rates and crop yields.1,5 Thus, in 
the last decades, microalgae have already raised high interest in industry as a renewable source for so
called thirdgeneraon biofuels that do not compete with human food producon.2,6 Microalgae have 
further been studied as microscopic bioreneries for olens of dierent chain length7 as well as for 
other highaddedvalue metabolites.8 For example, microalgaebased oil has also been employed for 
the preparaon of polyol architectures that can be converted into polyurethane foams.9,10 However, 
microalgae remain unexplored in other elds such as addive manufacturing.
