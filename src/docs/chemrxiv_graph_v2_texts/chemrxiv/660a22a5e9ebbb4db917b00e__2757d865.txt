Description:
0D allotropes of carbon.

Text:
SWCNTs are typically 0.42 nm in diameter, while MWCNTs can be much larger, with 
diameters of tens of nanometers, having both ends generally capped by fullerenelike domes.1 
Similar to fullerenes and graphene, which are the analogous 0 and 2D allotropes of carbon, the 
graphitelike arrangement of carbon atoms in CNTs and their shape give them remarkable and 
unique properties, which has resulted in the widespread use of CNTs in several fields of science 
and technology, including energy storage, electronics, structural composites, biomaterials, and 
others.
