Description:
An electropositive element from the IIIA group used in IIIV compound semiconductors.

Text:
IIIV compound semiconductors composed of IIIAgroup electropositive elements (B, Al, Ga, In) 
combined with VAgroup electronegative elements (N, P, As, Sb) have long been considered a 
promising material basis for a number of wellestablished commercial technologies, as well as for 
new advanced classes of electronic and optoelectronic devices 14. Examples include 
heterostructure and highelectronmobility bipolar transistors, lightemitting diodes, diode lasers, 
photodetectors, and electrooptic modulators. The physical properties of the constituent materials 
are critical to the operating characteristics of these devices. Under normal conditions, the majority of IIIV semiconductor compounds crystallize in the cubic 
zincblende (zb) structure (space group F43m, No.
