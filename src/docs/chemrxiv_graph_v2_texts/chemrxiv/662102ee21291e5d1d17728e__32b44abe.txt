Description:
A two-dimensional transition metal carbide, nitride, or carbonitride with high specific surface area, hydrophilicity, conductivity, and mechanical strength.

Text:
MXene, a twodimensional transition metal carbide, nitride, or carbonitride, has received a tremendous 
amount of research attention since its discovery in 2011.1 The high specific surface area, hydrophilicity, 
conductivity and mechanical strength of MXenes make them promising for applications including energy 
storage,27 electromagnetic interference shielding,810 and catalysis11. MXenes can be described as a hexagonal 
closed packed structure comprising of Mn1XnTx (n1 to 4; where M is early d block transition metal; X is 
carbon or nitrogen; T is surface terminated groups such as O, OH, Cl, and F, depending on the chemical 
etchant).12 Terminal group free MXenes (Mn1XnT0) are determined to have D3d symmetry.13 However, the 
presence of the terminal groups distorts the symmetry of the unit cell.

Description:
A structure that can incorporate two transition metals, either randomly or in ordered layers.

Text:
To date, more than 
50 MXenes have been reported to be successfully synthesised.12 The family of MXenes is further expanded 
when two transition metals are mixed in a MXene structure, in which the transition metal may either be 
arranged randomly across all the M layers, or they may form ordered structures.1921 Given that the ratio of M 
and X in these double transition metal MAX precursors can be controlled as needed, the number of possible 
MXenes can be limitless.
