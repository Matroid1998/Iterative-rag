Description:
Ions with ladderlike energy levels used in upconversion luminescence.

Text:
Lanthanidedoped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are nanoscale colloidal light 
emitters that absorb multiple lowenergy photons and emit a higherenergy photon. This optical 
property, known as upconversion luminescence (UCL), is enabled by the ladderlike energy levels 
of lanthanide ions doped within an inorganic host matrix.
