Description:
Requires specialized processing and safe vehicles for solubilisation due to its hydrophobic nature.

Text:
The technological innovations in drug discovery have led to the development of larger, more 
complex and more hydrophobic compounds as lead candidates and active pharmaceutical 
ingredients. According to an estimate, 40 of the drugs in market and 90 of the new 
chemical entities are considered hydrophobic 1. These molecules require specialized 
processing and safe vehicles for solubilisation, including problems at various levels from 
discovery to processing and formulations development 2. However, many vehicles available 
do either not have an ideal safety profile, e.g. Cremophor EL (CrEL) for paclitaxel (PTX) 
administration 3 or are not as good solubilizers as would be desired.
