Description:
An energy vector essential for decarbonization and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

Text:
The use of hydrogen as an energy vector has been declared an essential strategy for the European Union
(EU) for decarbonization of its energy generation and to reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels. However, in 2022, only 2 of Europes energy was provided by H2, and of that, 96 was produced from
natural gas 1. Currently, there are four major electrolyzer technologies Proton exchange membrane
electrolysis (PEMEL), alkaline electrolysis (AEL), anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMEL),
and solid oxide electrolysis (SOEL). Amongst them, AEL and PEMEL are the most mature and commer
cially available 2. PEMEL relies heavily on platinum group metals (PGMs) as catalysts, which hinders its
largescale deployment 3, 4.

Description:
Involved in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyzers.

Text:
AEL, on the other hand, uses nonnoblemetal catalysts, making it cheaper,
but typically results in lower efficiency. Therefore, significant improvements in efficiency while maintaining
stable operation are necessary for AEL 5, 6, 7, 8. Alkaline electrolyzers comprise two halfcell reactions, the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and the
Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), with the cell efficiency being drastically undermined by the slug
gish kinetics of the OER. Therefore, research focuses on exploring more active catalyst materials for the
OER. Despite the importance of high catalytic activity to minimize overpotential losses, the catalysts
durability should not be forgotten. Catalysts are seldom tested under industrial electrolyzer conditions,
creating a discrepancy between laboratory test conditions and industrial electrolyzer conditions displayed
in Figure 1.
