Description:
A metabolite formed from the C8 oxidation of caffeine.

Text:
Secondary metabolic pathways proceed via C8oxidation of caffeine to afford 1,3,7
trimethyluric acids (15 of metabolites).8 Tertiary metabolic pathways are via demethylation 
at the N1position of caffeine to theobromine and N7position to theophylline (both account for 
78 of metabolites).8. Furthermore, minor metabolites of caffeine include 1methylxanthine 
(1X), 1methyluric acid (1U), 5acetylamino6formylamino3methyluracil (AFMU), and 1,7
