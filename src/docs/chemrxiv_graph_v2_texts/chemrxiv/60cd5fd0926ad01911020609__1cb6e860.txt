Description:
A compound whose derivatives block the replication of many RNA viruses by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Text:
Pyrazine derivatives such as T705,79 3hydroxypyrazine2carboxamide (T1105),10,11 and 
3,4dihydro3oxo4dribofuranosyl2pyrazinecarboxamide (T1106),12 blocks the replication 
of many RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo, and Pichinde), and are expected 
to be an effective antiviral drug for COVID19. The selective inhibition of viral RNAdependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRp) is assumed to be the mechanism of action for their antiSARSCoV

2.13,14 Their antiviral effects are based on the fact that the viral RNA polymerase mistakenly 
recognizes 
3hydroxypyrazine2carboxamideribofuranosyl5triphosphate 
(pyrazineRTP) 
structure as a purine nucleotide (adenosine and guanosine). Thus, they prevent virus 
multiplication with purine analog effects as RdRp inhibitors. Since RdRp domains are not 
present in human cells and are conserved among RNA viruses, this distinct specific mechanism 
targeting RNA viral polymerases makes pyrazine derivatives an attractive drug candidate. Chart 1.
