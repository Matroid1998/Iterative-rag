Description:
Compounds with a CHg bond that is a highly unusual organometallic linkage with essentially covalent character.

Furthermore, organomercurial 
compounds are known valuable synthons (Scheme 2).17, 18 The 
CHg bond is a highly unusual organometallic linkage with 
essentially covalent character.19 CHg bonds are known 
precursors for carboncentered radicals and can be facilely 
transformed into CC, CO, and CI bonds.20, 21 We wondered if 
we could build on our previous work to furnish technology for a 
rearrangementremercuration of primary allylic silanols into 
organomercurial synthons. Here, we are pleased to report that, 
though careful control of reaction conditions, allylic silanols can 
be rearranged into 5membered silanediol organomercurial 
heterocycles or into linear organomercurial ketones (Scheme 
1). To our knowledge, no analogous transformation exists in the 
literature. a. Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas,
