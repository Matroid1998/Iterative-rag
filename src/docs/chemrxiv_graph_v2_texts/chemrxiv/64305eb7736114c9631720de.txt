also been discussed in the context of a proposed universal in
tegrated rate equation; however, in our hands that method ap
pears to give unphysical results when applied to this class of
problem (see Supporting Information).3 Herein, we present
the derivation of integrated rate equations that are applica
ble to either comproportionation or disproportionation reac
tions with any initial concentrations of reactants. The utility
of these rate equations is most obvious in fitting timecourse
data to extract values for kf and kb. This data analysis process is demonstrated for the dispro
portionation of TEMPO (2,2,6,6tetramethyl1piperidinyl
Noxyl) under buffered mildly acidic aqueous conditions
(Fig. 1).
