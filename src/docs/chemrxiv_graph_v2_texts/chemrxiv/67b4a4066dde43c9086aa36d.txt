Description:
Macromolecules and polymers separated by gel permeation chromatography based on molecular weight.

Text:
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), a form of size exclusion chromatography (SEC), is a 
technique that separates analytes based on their molecular weight 1. First explored by 
by J. C. Moore in 1964 and subsequently commercialized by Waters Corporation in the same 
year, GPC has become the predominant chromatographic technique for the separation of 
macromolecules and polymers, including polyethylene glycols (PEGs) 2. This technique 
provides valuable information regarding the molecular weight distribution of polymers 
composition, which is a fundamental property in polymer characterization, following the 
polymer type itself 3. Any sample molecules that are smaller than the pore size can diffuse
