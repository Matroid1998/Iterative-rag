Description:
Each center in dicopper carbene complexes is supported by a diketiminate ligand.

Text:
For example, the group of Warren 
reported two dicopper carbene complexes in which each copper 
center is supported by a diketiminate ligand (Figure 1).13,14 They 
show that these complexes can transfer their carbene ligand to 
alkenes, phosphines and dioxygen. However, these complexes exist 
in equilibrium with their mononuclear carbene counterparts in 
solution, and it is proposed that the mononuclear carbene 
complexes are responsible for the observed carbene transfer 
reactivity. Similarly, the group of Hoffman reported a dicopper 
carbene complex supported by two iminophosphanamide ligands 
(Figure 1).15 This complex was found to react with alkenes to form 
the corresponding mononuclear carbene and alkene complexes, 
but no carbene transfer reactivity was reported.

Description:
Omnipresent in carbene transfer literature.

Text:
Since copper is omnipresent in carbene transfer literature, we were 
interested to see if it was possible to use our PNNP expanded pincer 
system to support a welldefined dicopper carbene motif using 
similar carbenes as used by Warren and Hoffman. This can provide 
insights into the reactivity and stability of the dicopper carbene 
motif itself, and help deconvolute the reactivity that has thus far 
been observed for dicopper carbene complexes.
