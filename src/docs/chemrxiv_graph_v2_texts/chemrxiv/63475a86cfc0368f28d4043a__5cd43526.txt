Description:
Can block the most reactive and least selective sites, affecting catalyst selectivity.

Text:
Coke formation typically occurs in two stages; an initial fast coking regime, and a later
regime where the buildup of further coke is much slower,16,17 which indicates that early
coking stages change catalysts selectivity to limit further coking. This change in selectivity
has been attributed to carbon blocking the most reactive and least selective sites, which
can catalyze sidereactions leading to coke formation.1823 An additional explanation is that
the presence of carbon can modify olefin adsorption strength on a surface, and increase the
energy barrier for CH activation.17 Coke may therefore deactivate Pt catalysts via an elec
tronic interaction, in addition to steric blocking.
