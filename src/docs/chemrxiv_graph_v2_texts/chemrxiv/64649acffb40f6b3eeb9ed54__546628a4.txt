Description:
An element whose ions can be readily accommodated by the open structure of Prussian blue for reversible intercalation processes.

Text:
Prussian blue (PB) is an important porous metalcyanide framework structure (AxFe3FeII(CN)6y.nH2O) with exchangeable A cations. Along 
with its analogs, it shows promise for a range of important applications13 including as cathodes in secondary ion batteries.410 Indeed, PB 
cathodes have potential in widespread, lowcost energy storage applications, using abundant and affordable Na or K based aqueous 
electrolytes.1012 In particular, K ions can be readily accommodated by the open structure of PB, which allows for reversable intercalation 
processes that are challenging in layered transition metal oxide cathodes. Despite the identified potential, unexpected complexities within the PB structure have made fundamental understanding of intercalation 
processes difficult.

Description:
Involved in intercalation processes and studied using X-ray absorption techniques.

Text:
Highly crystalline materials, 
considered to have a limited number of defects, are reported to favor superior cyclelife and rate capability. The importance of Fe(CN)64 
defects in contributing to structural collapse is stated to be due to their inhibition of ion insertion and decrease in electronic conductivity.25
28 However, understanding the loss of capacity is again complicated by the differing process mechanisms that are suggested for charge 
balancing and K intercalation. Importantly, current understanding of the location of K in PB is deduced from general long range structural information such as diffraction 
data, or via theoretical simulation. Herein, we show that operando potassium Kedge Xray absorption near edge structure (XANES) can
