Description:
A compound whose mobility shifts decrease with increasing molecular weight.

Text:
of SR depend, not only on the ion masses, but on the interaction energies of the 
ionSR adducts. In this study, we introduced five different SRs using ESIIMSMS to study the effect of the 
interaction energy and size on mobility shifts. The mobility shifts showed a decreasing trend as the molecular 
weight increased for the series of compounds ethanolamine, valinol, serine, threonine, phenylalanine, 
tyrosine, tributylamine, tryptophan, desipramine, and tribenzylamine. It was proved that the decreasing trend 
was partially due to the inverse relation between the mobility and drift time and hence, the shift in drift time 
better reflects the pure effect of SR on the mobility of analytes. Yet the drift time shift exhibited a mild 
decrease with the mass of ions.

Description:
Has a low binding energy interaction with shift reagents, leading to short-lived clusters.

Text:
Valinol pulled out from this trend because it had a low binding energy 
interaction with all the SR and, consequently, its clusters were shortlived. This short lifetime produced fewer 
collisions against the buffer gas and a drift time shorter compared to those of ions of similar molecular weight. Analyte ionSR interactions were calculated using Gaussian. IMS with the introduction of SR could be the 
choice for the freeinterferents detection of illegal drugs, explosives, and biological and warfare agents. The 
suppression of false positives could facilitate the transit of passengers and cargos, rise the confiscation of 
illicit substances, and save money and distresses due to needless delays. Keywords Adduction, ion mobility spectrometry, mass spectrometry, shift reagent, valinol, buffer gas
