Description:
Can form oxo centers that are active species for the activation of methane.

Text:
Two 
important design goals for a MOF catalyst for the selective conversion of methane to methanol 
are suggested by economics and prior work 1) the catalyst should be active under mild 
conditions16 and 2) the obtained methanol should be protected to prevent overoxidation.6 Metal
oxo centers are active species for the activation of the CH bond of methane and other alkanes10,17
22 and can be designed into a variety of MOF structures.
