Description:
A commonly used catalyst for the synthesis of polyurethanes.

Text:
Photocurable polyurethanes are gaining great interest for use in medical applications, particularly for 
minimally invasive surgical procedures. For example, these types of novel biomaterials can be in the 
form of injectable (macro)monomers that can be transformed by UV light into elastomeric patches 1. As a result, there is a research focus into new formulations and materials with improved properties, new 
synthesis routes, and new catalytic systems. The most commonly used catalysts for the synthesis of 
polyurethanes include antimony trioxide 2, antimony acetate 3, ethylene glycol aluminum 4. However, these homometallic catalysts are toxic and thus require difficult and costly postprocessing to 
remove residual catalyst, particularly when product is intended for medical applications 5,6.
