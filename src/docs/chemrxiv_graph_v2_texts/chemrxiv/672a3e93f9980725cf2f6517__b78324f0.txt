Description:
Retards the hydration of CA2 and affects C3S and C6AF in synthetic mixes.

Text:
32 and Huller et al. 20 demonstrated that
45
the hydration of CA2 begins once the hydration rate of CA has reached its maximum. Even very low
46
CAcontents (5 wt.) were sufficient to retard the hydration of CA2. This retarding effect of CA was
47
also reported for C3S 5 and C6AF2 11 in synthetic mixes of the pure phases. The authors attributed
48
this retarding effect to high calcium and aluminum concentrations in the pore solution resulting from
49
initial CA dissolution without precipitation of hydrate phases. 50
When additives are present during CAC hydration, the reaction kinetics can be strongly influenced.
