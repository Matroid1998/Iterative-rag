Description:
A substrate converted into cyclic selina4(15),7(11)diene by selina4(15),7(11)diene synthase.

Text:
Selina4(15),7(11)diene synthase (SdS) from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis ATCC 
25486 catalyzes a multistep reaction that converts (2E,6E)FDP (1) into cyclic selina
4(15),7(11)diene (2) as a major product along with small percentage of germacrene B (3).23,34 
Our recent work avoiding water capture in hydroxylating sesquiterpene synthases has generated 
understanding of how these enzymes employ water molecules to produce hydroxylated
