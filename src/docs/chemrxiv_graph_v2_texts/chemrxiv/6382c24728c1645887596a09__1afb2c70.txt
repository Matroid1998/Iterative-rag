Description:
Undergoes cyclisation with cyclohexane-1,3-dione for the synthesis of multiply substituted quinolines.

Text:
Quinoline is an important natural heterocycle with a structural framework which is common to various bioactive molecules1, 2. As shown in 
Fig. 1, multiply substituted quinolines serve as privileged scaffolds in many synthetic therapeutics with a wide array of physiological attributes 
as potential anticancer37, antiviral8, 9, antifibrotic10, antimalarial1114, and antiinflammatory drugs1518. Moreover, polysubstituted quinolines 
have unique applications as agrochemicals (pyrroloquinoline quinone)19, electroluminescent materials (8hydroxyquinoline)2022, and 
dyestuffs (quinoline yellow)23. To date, the methods proposed for the synthesis of multiply substituted quinolines include the 42 
cycloaddition of aromatic imines and methyl propiolate, cyclisation of 2aminobenzaldehyde and cyclohexane1,3dione, etc., or substitution 
reactions on existing quinoline scaffolds (Scheme 1). However, these methods have disadvantages, such as expensive and dangerous 
materials, nongreen solvents, multistep process, and high temperature.
