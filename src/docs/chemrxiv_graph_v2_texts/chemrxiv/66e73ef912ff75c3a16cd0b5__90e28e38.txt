Description:
A solvent used for comparison in photoluminescence studies of TADF emitters.

2) Selfassembled 
nanoparticles.6 Selfassembled waterdispersible nanostructures (NPs) based on three known TADF 
emitters (2CzPN, 4CzIPN, and 4CzIPNPh, Figure S1b) were reported by Lee et al. that relied on the 
limited water solubility of these compounds to form the NPs with sizes ranging from 80 to 200 nm.6a 
All three NPs showed a slight redshift in their PL compared to those in toluene, coupled with a slight 
decrease of their respective photoluminescence quantum yield (PL) (19.4 for 2CzPN NPs, PL  
503 nm; 11.9 for 4CzIPN NPs, PL  518 nm; and 3.6 for 4CzTPNPh NPs, PL  588 nm). One 
and twophoton fluorescence images using these NPs in an A549 cell were obtained using fluorescence 
microscopy and laser scanning confocal fluorescence, respectively.
