Description:
A noble metal used in phosphorescent emitters for OLEDs to achieve 100% utilization of electrogenerated singlet and triplet excitons to produce light.

Since 1987, when the first viable electroluminescent device was reported by Tang and Van 
Slyke,1 significant progress has been made in terms of materials development such that organic 
lightemitting diodes (OLEDs) have now been commercialized in both the solidstate lighting 
and display markets. The current mature OLED products heavily rely on the phosphorescent 

2 

emitters that contain noble metals such as iridium because these materials permit 100 
utilization of the electrogenerated singlet and triplet excitons to produce light. The breakthrough 
of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials in 2012 by Adachi and co
workers2 provides an alternative route to reach equally efficient OLEDs, and without the use 
of these scarce metals.
