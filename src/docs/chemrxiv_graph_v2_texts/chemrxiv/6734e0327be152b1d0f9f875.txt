Description:
A product of the full mineralization of CF bonds during thermal destruction of PFAS.

Text:
The thermal destruction of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has garnered much attention
recently due to concerns of adverse health effects, environmental bioaccumulation, and long
halflives.15 Full mineralization of all CF bonds into HF and CO2 is necessary for effective
removal of PFAS from contaminated matrices, but the combustion is often incomplete.
