Description:
A toxic metal that is strictly regulated in water sources.

Text:
Drinking water is a major source of environmental exposure. In the developed 
world, most people in urban and suburban regions receive a managed and treated 
water supply, with those in rural areas often relying on wells to access groundwater. Contamination of water sources by heavy metals presents a threat to health, and hence 
metal concentrations in groundwater and treated water sources are assessed for their 
compliance with existing regulations. While some metals such as arsenic, cadmium, 
and lead are widely understood to be toxic and hence are strictly regulated, other 
metals are considered to be safe even when concentrations exceed the ppb range. Manganese (Mn) is a dietary element, incorporated into important metalloenzymes such 
as MnSOD.
