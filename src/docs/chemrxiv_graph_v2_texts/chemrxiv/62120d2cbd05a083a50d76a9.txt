Critical structural motifs in numerous pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.

Organosulfur compounds are widely used in medicinal and biochemistry, 
organic synthesis and material science.1 Thus, the development of efficient 
method for the construction of CS bond and the installation of sulfur
containing functional groups into organic molecules are topics of 
continuous interest. Among different sulfurcontaining compounds, vinyl 
sulfones often serve as the critical structural motifs in numerous 
pharmaceuticals and biologically active compounds.2 Given the great 
significance, considerable efforts have been exerted to develop efficient 
methods for the synthesis of these important frameworks.3 Except for the
