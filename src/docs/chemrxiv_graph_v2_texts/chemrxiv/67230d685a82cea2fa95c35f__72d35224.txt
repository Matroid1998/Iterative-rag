Description:
A physical solvent that dissolves CO2 through nonbonded electrostatic and van der Waals interactions.

Furthermore, the required scale for deploying these solutions 
(7.6 Gtyr) is 190x times larger than the current global 
capacity for CCS (0.04 Gtyr).16 This significant gap leaves a 
narrow window for both technological development and the 
implementation of such a substantial increase in capacity.17 
The 
most 
scalable 
capture 
technology 
employed 
commercially today are liquid solvents. Physical solvents like 
Selexol (a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol) 
work by dissolving CO2 through nonbonded electrostatic and 
van der Waals interactions. Selexol is primarily effective in 
precombustion highpressure environments, limiting its 
application to specific industries like hydrogen production.18 
In contrast, chemical solvents, primarily amines, have a 
broader scope due to their reversible reaction with CO2.
