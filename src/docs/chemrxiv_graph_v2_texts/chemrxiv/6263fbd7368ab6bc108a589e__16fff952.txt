Description:
A compound whose ring can be activated by Lewis acid catalysts for isomerization reactions.

Text:
Over time, however, we 
realized that many oxetanecarboxylic acids were intrinsically 
unstable  they easily isomerized into lactones under storage at 
room temperature or under slight heating. Here, we want to 
disclose this unknown in the literature phenomenon, as 
chemists keep on using these molecules (Scheme 1), without 
realizing that many of them are unstable, as that could 
dramatically affect reaction yields and lead to negative results 
(especially in those reactions that require heating). Intended intramolecular isomerizations of oxetanes by 
nucleophiles were reported in the literature (Scheme 1).7,8 In 
most cases these reactions required additional activation of the 
oxetane ring by Lewisacid catalysts (In, Sc, Fe, BF3, Co, Pd, 
phosphoric acids, etc).
