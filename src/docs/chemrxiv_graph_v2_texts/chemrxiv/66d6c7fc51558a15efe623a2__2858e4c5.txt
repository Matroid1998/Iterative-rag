Description:
Part of a compound pair used in photochemical and thermal isomerization studies.

However, identifying compounds for MOST application is 
challenging due to the intricate interplay between the photochemical and thermal isomerization 
processes.58 In this context, a number of privileged compound pairs have been proposed, which 
include norbornadiene  quadricyclane,9 Eazobenzene  Zazobenzene,10 and dihydro
azulen  vinylheptafulven11 (Figure 1B). Current research concentrates on improving the 
photophysical properties of the established systems1215 as well as on identifying new isomer 
couples.1620 Important metrics for MOST optimization are high isomerization yields (95), 
significant backisomerization energies (Hiso  300 Jg), and a good overlap with the solar 
spectrum (  300800 nm). A major challenge remains the improvement of the thermal stability 
of the photoisomer, which is a crucial factor for safe and longterm energy storage.
