Description:
An essential chemical for human society as a raw material for artificial fertilizers.

Text:
Ammonia is an essential chemical for human society as a raw material for artificial fertilizers. Its production 
is mainly synthesized in largescale plants at a rate of 150 to 180 million tons per year, increasing by 2.3 per 
year 1. Ammonia is also attracting attention as a renewable energy carrier since it can be synthesized from 
hydrogen obtained by water electrolysis using surplus electricity from solar and wind power generation 1,2. While hydrogen needs to be lowered to about 240C to liquefy at 1 MPa, ammonia easily liquefies at room 
temperature at 1 MPa, thus liquefied ammonia has a higher energy density and is a superior energy carrier3. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by industrial ammonia synthesis is equivalent to 1.4  of total human 
emissions4.

Description:
Synthesized industrially using Fe-based catalysts at 400-600Â°C and 100-300 atm.

Text:
In the HaberBosch process, a typical method for industrial ammonia synthesis, Febased catalysts 
have been used for more than 100 years, and the addition of alkali metals enhances their activity 5. In industrial 
processes, Febased catalysts synthesize ammonia at 400600C and 100300 atm 2,5. These severe conditions 
are due to the very high binding energy of the N2 molecule (945 kJ mol1). Synthesis plants become massive and 
centralized to produce ammonia more cheaply and in larger quantities for benefits of scale 6,7. Rubased catalysts, the next generation of ammonia synthesis catalysts, are less susceptible to ammonia 
poisoning and more active than Febased catalysts 5,8. Ru is one of the best metals for ammonia synthesis 
based on a volcano plot 9.
