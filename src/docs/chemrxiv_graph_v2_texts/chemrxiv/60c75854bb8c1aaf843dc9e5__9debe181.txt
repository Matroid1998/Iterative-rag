Description:
Graphitelike carbon nitride used as a substrate for depositing fullerene to create hybrid nanostructures.

Text:
Likewise, small fullerenes have been synthesized and 
39 
characterized (e.g., from highresolution transmission electron microscopy), which have 
40 
associated an increased reactivity with attaching to substrates because of containing paired or 
41 
adjacent pentagons23, and their electronic properties are significantly influenced by the shape and 
42 
size 4. The unique properties of fullerenes turn into useful building blocks for constructing 
43 
supramolecular assemblies and micronanofunctional materials1. Consequently, noncovalent and 
44 
covalent nanostructures have been fulfilled by depositing fullerene onto emerging low dimensional 
45 
substrates such as graphene, perovskites, graphitelike carbon nitride, transitionmetal disulfides, 
46 
and hexagonal boron nitride1, 5. These hybrid nanostructures show potential applications in 
47 
different technologies such as catalysis, nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, storage, batteries, solar 
48 
cells, and spintronics, among others1, 5. 49
