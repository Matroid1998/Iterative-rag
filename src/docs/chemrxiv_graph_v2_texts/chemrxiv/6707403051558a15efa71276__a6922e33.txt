A sugar derivative used as an organogelator, capable of forming two stereoisomers at the anomeric position.

Organogelators include low molecularweight organogelators (LMG) and polymeric organogelators. 29 
LMGs express their functions by creating threedimensional supramolecular structures, such as self
30 
assembled fibrous structures, through noncovalent bonds, such as van der Waals interactions,  
31 
interactions, solvophobic effects, and hydrogen bonding. Various sugar derivatives have been 
32 
developed as LMGs.1 Dglucose has been the most well studied among the sugars, and various 
33 
derivatives have been developed as organogelators.26 However, synthesizing various organogelators 
34 
derived from Dglucose inevitably requires multiple steps. This is because the anomeric position of 
35 
Dglucose can form two stereoisomers,  and forms, and methyl glycosylation is often performed 
36 
first to fix either one of them.

Description:
The anomeric position of D-glucose is deoxygenated in 1,5anhydroDglucitol.

These compounds with such a restrained threedimensional molecular mobility improve the 
45 
intermolecular packing ability and facilitate the formation of threedimensional supramolecular 
46 
structures, i.e., selfassembled fibrous structures. 47 
Previously, we have developed LMGs in which linear saturated fatty acids are introduced into the 
48 
hydroxy groups of a sixmembered ring cyclic polyol. We have found that 1,5anhydroDglucitol 
49 
(1,5AG), one of the sixmembered ring cyclic polyols and a compound in which the anomeric 
50 
position of Dglucose is deoxygenated, is a good organogelator when linear saturated fatty acids are
