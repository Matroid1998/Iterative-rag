Description:
Functional derivatives used as polymer precursors for novel polymers.

Text:
The development of innovative, highperformance polymer materials requires monomers with unique 
functional groups that can promote their facile and effective polymerization. The use of functional 
phenolic styrene derivatives as polymer precursors has gained considerable attention because they can 
provide access to novel polymers with varied properties based on their functional groups.15 In addition, 
they derive from naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acids 1 and are thus potentially renewable building 
blocks for polymers and materials.6 These acids are natural phenolic compounds that can be found in 
almost every plant. High concentrations of pcoumaric (1a), caffeic (1b), ferulic (1c) and sinapic acid 
(1d) can be found in berries,7 coffee,8 rice bran,9 and oilseed crops,10 respectively.

Description:
Derivatives formed from the decarboxylation of hydroxycinnamic acids, capable of polymerization due to the electron-rich nature of their double bond.

However, the steric 
hindrance around the substituted vinyl group is an obstacle to homopolymerization.6 Even though they 
can be copolymerized with less bulky monomers, their content in the produced copolymers is still very 
low due to the same reason.13,14 Condensation polymerization is an alternative but leads to the loss of 
hydroxy groups.1517 While the direct polymerization of the biobased hydroxycinnamic acids is of limited 
efficiency, their decarboxylation gives rise to phenolic styrene derivatives 2.1820 Due to the electron
rich nature of their double bond, they can undergo polymerization via various mechanisms based on the 
functionality of the phenolic styrene derivative.2125 The diversity of the different biobased phenolic 
acids allows achieving different properties of the final product in order to meet specific demands.
