Description:
Requires exclusion in triplet systems to prevent the production of reactive species that photobleach catalysts and are toxic.

Text:
Hecht showed excellent 
azobenzene ZE isomerisation using triplet photoredox catalysts, 
via transient photooxidation to the radical cation11 (electronrich 
azobenzenes; e.g. AOMB, Fig 1ab) or photoreduction to the 
radical anion12,13 (if electronpoor). This arises as the radicals 
isomerise to their thermodynamically preferred E isomer ca. 1013 
times faster than do the neutral forms, so a 100E population 
accumulates after backelectron transfer. However, these systems 
are not applicable to biology. Among the many challenges, (i) with 
one exception,13 they are intermolecular concepts, so are unlikely to 
work at M levels needed for biocompatible reagents; (ii) as triplet 
systems, they require O2 exclusion to work efficiently, and with O2 
they also produce reactive species that photobleach the catalyst and 
are too toxic for use in biology (discussed in Supporting Note 1).
