Description:
A scarce and expensive noble metal used in electrocatalysts with zero HER overpotential.

Electrochemical energy technologies will significantly contribute to the transition to a 
sustainable and carbonneutral economy in order to decarbonize the energy sector.1 One of 
the most critical scientific and technological problems is the development of a sustainable and 
costeffective water splitting processes for industrialscale production of green H2 to facilitate 
the energy transition.2 Heterogeneous catalysis is a key element of the solution.3 Benchmark 
electrocatalysts with a zero HER overpotential used in low temperature water electrolysis 
systems are, however, based on scarce, expensive noble metals (specifically platinum group 
metal (PGM) catalysts).4 This makes them economically less attractive and does not meet the 
requirements for the global demand of green H2. Consequently, the development of lowcost, 
stable, and highly efficient hydrogenevolving materials is of key importance to meet this 
demand.
