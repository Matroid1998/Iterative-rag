Description:
Subject to selective reduction in lithium-mediated processes.

5 In conjunction 
with lithium metal, a solid electrolyte interphase forms which moderates the access of 
reagents to enable selective N2 reduction.6,7 
Vast improvements in the Faradaic efficiencies of lithium mediated N2 reduction have 
resulted primarily from research focused on optimising the electrolyte813 or employing 
more industrially relevant cells such as a flow cell with gas diffusion electrodes.12,14,15 
There have been a limited number of studies focused on the cathode material, most 
employ metal electrodes such as molybdenum9,10 or stainless steel.12,14 These electrodes 
exhibit low current density and electrochemical performance in terms of yield rate (nmol 
s1 cm2geo) towards ammonia due to their low surface area. In the stateoftheart flow cell,
