Description:
Exhibits three reversible oxidations and one reversible reduction in cyclic voltammetry.

Metalmetal
bonded dimeric porphyrin complexes in various accessible oxidation states were studied utilizing 
resonance Raman scattering, infrared absorption, and absorption spectroscopy.Error! Bookmark not defined.d,e For 
instance, Kadish and coworkers5 characterized the oneelectronoxidized forms of rutheniumruthenium
bonded dimeric corrole complexes using combination of UVVis spectrophotometry and EPR 
Spectroelectrochemistry. Collman 
and 
Arnold 
conducted 
experimental 
(UVVisNIREPR 
spectroelectrochemical) and theoretical (DFT) approaches to establish the electronic nature of the electro
generated species.4 
Interestingly, transition metal corrole dimer MTpXPC2 (M  Re or Os and TpXPC refers to a meso
tris(paraXphenyl) corrole and X CF3, H, Me, and OMe) have been synthesized recently by Ghosh and co
workers.6 The cyclic voltammetry measurements of the ReTpMePC2 and the OsTpMePC2 exhibit 
three reversible oxidations and one reversible reduction.
