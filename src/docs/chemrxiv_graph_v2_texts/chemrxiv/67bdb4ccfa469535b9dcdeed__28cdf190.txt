For many decades, Fe(III) porphyrin systems have been extensively studied in literature on account of their 
remarkable physical properties and interesting applications13 as well as their crucial role in biological 
systems.48 Porphyrins being large macrocycles, have plenty of electrons forming extended conjugation 
system due to which they exhibit characteristic electronic913 and electrochemical properties1416 both in 
solid state as well as in solution. Fe(III)X tetraphenylporphyrins (XBr, Cl, I, NCS) usually forms highspin complexes with S  52 spin 
ground state.17, 18 Nevertheless, a spinstate switching phenomenon has been observed by Korszun and 
Mofat19 between the fivecoordinate highspin isothiocyanato methaemoglobin and the sixcoordinate low
spin histidine ligated isothiocyanato methaemoglobin.
