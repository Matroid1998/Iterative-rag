Description:
Organic compounds containing a carboxyl group, often reduced using hydride-containing agents.

Text:
Virtually every textbook on introductory organic chemistry discusses reductions of carboxylic acids and their 
derivatives, such as esters, acid halides, and (mixed) anhydrides, focuses on hydridecontaining reducing agents, 
most notably LAH and DIBAL.1 The former was introduced to organic synthesis back in 1947, while the latter was 
initially used for olefin polymerization starting in 1960. And while their extensive service to organic synthesis over 
decades is secure, their intolerance to air and moisture along with reactivityselectivity issues are also wellknown 
limitations. Moreover, as seen today through green glasses, there is considerable room for approaches that, while 
equally effective, are not only more functional group tolerant but also in line with the times where the overall 
impact on the environment is also kept in mind.

Description:
Compounds that can be selectively reduced to aldehydes via a thioester intermediate.

Text:
The most relevant prior art to this study involves the timehonored 
Fukuyama reduction, commonly viewed as a robust method for reducing carboxylic acids selectively to aldehydes 
that proceeds via a thioester intermediate employing a Pd catalyst and Et3SiH as a mild reductant.10 Advances of 
late using Earthabundant nickel have emerged as alternative catalytic approaches.1113 For example, Iosub, 
Bergman, and coworkers have recently developed a Ni (10 mol )catalyzed process using a mixed anhydride as 
an intermediate and Ph2SiH2 as reductant14 in dilute EtOAc at 40 C, over 24 hours, for converting (mainly) aliphatic 
carboxylic acids to aldehydes.
