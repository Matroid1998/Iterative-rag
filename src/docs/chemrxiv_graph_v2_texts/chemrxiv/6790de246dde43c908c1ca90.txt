Porous carbon materials have achieved extraordinary success in a variety of environment and 
energyrelated applications.1 The quest for efficient energy storage solutions has particularly 
fueled a significant interest in these materials, renowned for their customizable pore structures, 
high surface areas, and exceptional electrochemical properties.27 Among various possible 
synthetic strategies aimed at the preparation of porous carbon materials, the hightemperature 
carbonization method appears as a promising solution due to its low cost and simplicity 
accompanied by the ability to produce materials with tailorable and welldefined pore structures, 
superior thermal stability as well as excellent scalability and reproducibility. The range of
