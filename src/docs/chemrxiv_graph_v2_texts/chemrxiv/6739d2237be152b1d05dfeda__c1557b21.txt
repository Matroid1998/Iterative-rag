Description:
A novel tetrapeptide isolated from the culture broth of Lecanicillium aphanocladii FKI9593.

The 
potential for secondary metabolite production has attracted 
significant interest. In a previous study, we isolated the Lecanicillium 
aphanocladii FKI9593 strain from this specimen. 9 Interestingly, no 
additional microorganisms, including bacteria, were isolated from the 
specimen under the experimental conditions. Herein, we report the 
fermentation, isolation, structural determination, and biological 
evaluation of the novel natural products 1 and 2 from the culture broth of 
the Lecanicillium aphanocladii FKI9593 strain. Results and Discussion 
Fermentation, isolation, and structural determination of 1 and 2. Novel tetrapeptides, tengupeptins A (1) and B (2), together with the 
known compound, oosporein (Figures S22 and S23),10,11 were isolated 
from the culture broth of the Lecanicillium aphanocladii FKI9593 strain. Compound 2 was obtained during the initial fermentation.
