Description:
An aromatic molecule that undergoes protonation and deprotonation processes.

Text:
The antioxidant activity of 
phenols against free radicals comes from their elimination role, which is related to their 
ability to react with radicals much more quickly than other organic substrates. For 
example, tocopherol (vitamin E) is mentioned as an efficient capture agent that can 
eliminate harmful peroxide radicals in the blood plasma 5,6. Protonation and deprotonation processes in aromatic molecules such as phenols 
are important in organic chemistry and biochemistry 7. Through the deprotonation of 
phenol, the phenoxide or phenolate ion is formed, stabilized by resonance. In comparison 
with phenol, the phenoxide ion is more stable because of the high displacement of the
