Description:
Exemplified by the antidiabetic agent with a nitrogen atom in the bridgehead position.

Text:
chiral 
auxiliary sultams with scaffolds other than camphor,33 
benzothiazines,34 or bridging sultams featuring a nitrogen 
atom in the bridgehead position.35 Additionally, Nsubstitu
ted isothiazolidine1,1dioxide (sultam) is exemplified by 
the antidiabetic agent 12 (Figure 3). Meanwhile, numerous examples of lowmolecular
weight compounds employed as active drugs possess a rigid, 
conformationally restricted structure.26,36 Conformationally 
rigid systems, e.g. fused, bridged, and spirocyclic fragments 
containing small andor medium cycles, are highlighted for 
their 
unique 
attributes,3741 
including 
bioresistance, 
metabolic resistance at physiological pH values, etc. Over the past 20 years, leading pharmaceutical 
companies (BMS, Takeda, Merck  Dohme, etc) have 
shown increasing interest in saturated conformationally rigid 
bicyclic fused sultams, which exhibit remarkable anticancer 
activity and have been studied as potential antischizophrenic 
and antithrombotic agents (Figure 3).
