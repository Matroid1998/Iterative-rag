Neutral framework materials with accessible cavities or channels.

However, neutralframework all
silica zeolites and zeolitelike materials having other elements on the T sites have also been 
reported.16,17 The presence of accessible cavities or channels is a key feature of zeolite crystal 
structures, and the arising intrinsic porosity is pivotal for their largescale use in catalysis, ion 
exchange, and separation processes.16 Besides these established applications, zeolites have 
also received considerable interest as potential drug delivery materials, along with other
