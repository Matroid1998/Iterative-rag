Description:
A drug used to target the protein kinase BRAF.

Additionally, if one
is only interested in the relative order of binding afnities, the rank
ing of compounds with similar structures and binding modes, the
entropy contribution to the binding free energy can be omitted,
which is often recommended as it reduces the computational cost
and avoids adding an additional nonnegligible error margin. It has
been found that MMPBGBSA performances generally vary with
the tested system and also depend on the used force eldand the
solute dielectric constant 12, 15, 8. Here, we wanted to reassess the use of MMPBSA for ne rank
ing of a drug, dabrafenib, and its known metabolites in aim at
predicting a potential impact of its pharmacokinetics, its metab
olization on its efcacy on its primary target the proteinkinase
BRAF.

Description:
A BRAF kinase inhibitor used to treat BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancers, including unresectable or metastatic melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

Text:
Dabrafenib 16 is a BRAF kinase inhibitor, which inhibits
BRAF V600 mutationpositive cancer cell growth. It is an FDA
approved drug indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 muta
tion 17, 18 and as combination therapy since recently also for
metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer harboring BRAF V600E mu
tations 19. Despite improved response rates and overall survival of
BRAFV600 mutant cancer patients, resistance is rapidly acquired,
resulting in a relapse of most patients within a year 20. This ef
fect may be partially due to the fast metabolism of dabrafenib (with
a halflife of 5 hours 21).
