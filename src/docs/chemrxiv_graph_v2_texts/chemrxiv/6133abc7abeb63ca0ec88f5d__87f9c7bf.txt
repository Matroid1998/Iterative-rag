Functional polymers find broad application in the biomedical field. Inter alia, research and 
application in drug, protein and gene delivery systems 118 selfassembled polymers 1923, 
nanoreactors 24, 25, bioimaging contrast agent carriers 26, antibiofouling coatings 13, 27
29, sensors 30, 31, tissue engineering 3234 requires specifically designed polymers with 
suitable functionalities for appropriate bioconjugation and further biomedical application 35
37. Among the plethora of synthetic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) remains the 
commercially available gold standard for biomedical application due to its high hydrophilicity 
combined with good solubility in organic solvents 38, low toxicity 39, and stealth behavior 
40. In addition, structural varieties such as starPEG and a considerable diversity of end
group functionalization 38, 4143 are commercially available.
