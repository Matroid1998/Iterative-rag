Description:
A material predicted to feature oxocarbon radical anions and extreme metallicity.

Text:
In this computational study, we address materials composed 
formally of K and CO, and focus especially on K3C6O6, a material 
we predict to feature oxocarbon radical anions, extreme metal
licity and the potential for rare band superconductivity. Our 
study is in part motivated by the possibility of producing me
tallic organic salts, i.e., compounds where ionic and covalent 
bonding situations are mixed in a metallic solidstate struc
ture.1 Such compounds can exhibit a range of properties 
needed in, for example, spintronics, superconductors, optoe
lectronic devices, and electrochemical sensors.24 
CO is a common ligand useful for probing electronic structure 
in part due to its ability to engage in backdonation. However, 
CO can also react with itself. The thermodynamic ground state 
of CO in the condensed phase is experimentally uncertain.

Description:
Predicted to be highly ionic and metallic in its P6mmm ground state.

Text:
In what follows, we outline predictions of the solidstate phase 
diagram of Kn(CO)m at ambient conditions of pressure. We then 
focus on explaining the unusual P6mmm ground state of 
K3C6O6, which we predict to be both highly ionic, metallic, and
