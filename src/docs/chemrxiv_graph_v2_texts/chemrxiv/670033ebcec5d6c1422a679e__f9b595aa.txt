Description:
A sacrificial Li agent added to the cathode to mediate irreversible Li loss from SEI formation.

decomposition into solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) entails irreversible Liloss  particularly an 
34 
issue for industrially attractive zeroLiexcess battery cells.9 Irreversible Li loss from SEI formation 
35 
may be mediated in three ways (i) by limiting the contact area between the solidelectrolyte and 
36 
anode10,11, (ii) by adding sacrificial Li agents such as for instance Li3N to the cathode 12,13 or (iii) 
37 
by designing solid electrolytes which are thermodynamically stable at the operating potentials of 
38 
lowpotential anodes. 39 
Irreducible or fully reduced phases are thermodynamically stable against Li metal and are thus 
40 
inherently irreducible against lowpotential anodes. Irreducible refers to all elements (except for 
41 
Li) in the material being in their lowest possible formal oxidation state (i.e.
