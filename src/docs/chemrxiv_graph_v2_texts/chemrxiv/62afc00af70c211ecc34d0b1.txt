Description:
A cost-effective thermoplastic polymer used in microfluidic fabrications, providing biocompatibility, gas permeability, and good optical properties.

Furthermore, leaching of 
uncrosslinked oligomers of PDMS could be problematic for cell culture applications 10. On a more 
macroscale, these devices often malfunction under highpressure conditions, making many post
fabrication processing strategies unfeasible. Recent research efforts have thus been directed 
towards the material optimization of microfluidic devices. To this end, thermoplastic microfluidic 
platforms have garnered significant interest, given their excellent material properties and low 
device cost, relative to their glass and PDMS device counterparts. Materials such as poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (PMMA), cyclic Olefin polymer (COP), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), 
polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyester terephthalate 
(PETE) are considered costeffective thermoplastic polymers for microfluidic fabrications, 
providing biocompatibility, gas permeability and good optical properties 1114. 3
