Description:
An element important in organic synthesis, life science, and materials science.

Text:
Alkenes are among the most prevalent and valuable feedstocks in organic synthesis. Direct and selective 
difunctionalization of alkenes, which simultaneously adds two synthetically valuable functionalities across a 
double bond, is a straightforward and economical approach to construct functionalized targets with high 

2 
molecular complexities.13 Specifically, the direct incorporation of sulfur4,5 and fluorine6 into alkenes has 
attracted intensive research interest of synthetic chemists due to the important roles of both elements in organic 
synthesis, life science, and materials science. For instance, organic molecules containing both sulfur and 
fluorine are present in many wellreceived pharmaceuticals, such as Flovent, Faslodex, and Glecaprevir 
(Scheme 1A).
