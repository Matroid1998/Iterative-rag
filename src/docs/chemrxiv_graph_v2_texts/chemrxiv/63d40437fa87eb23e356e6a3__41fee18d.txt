Description:
Used in the synthesis of Cvinyl glycosides, often in combination with Grignard reagents.

Text:
To achieve high yields, a dual 
catalytic system with ligands and external oxidants is generally 
required.6a, 6d, 6e, 7 
The synthesis of Cvinyl glycosides has also been performed 
photocatalytically, but generally relies on a significant number of 
protection and deprotection steps, dual catalytic systems, 
elevated temperature, Grignard or dialkylzinc reagents and often 
employ ligands (Scheme 1b).8 
In recent years, vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) have received 
significant attention as potent vinylating reagents.9 VBX reagents 
are easily synthesized in onepot from 2iodobenzoic acid,9b and
