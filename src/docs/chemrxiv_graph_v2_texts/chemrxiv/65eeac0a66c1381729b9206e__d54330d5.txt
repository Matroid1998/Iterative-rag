Description:
An inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K transporters.

Text:
For example, 
renal clearance of metformin, which is a substrate for OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K, was 
decreased in the coadministration of cimetidine and pyrimethamine, which are inhibitors of those 
transporters3,4. Regarding the mechanism of the clinical DDI between cimetidine and metformin, 
it has been hypothesized mechanistically that MATE1 and MATE2K play major roles for DDIs 
in the kidney because of the lower Ki values for MATE1 and MATE2K than OCT25. This was 
also supported by PBPK modeling6. MATE1 that is significantly more highly expressed than 
MATE2K, is considered to have the similar potency of transportability with MATE2K, and we 
have limited information of specific substrates in MATE2K, suggesting that MATE1 plays a 
major role in the renal DDI of drugs7,8,9.
