Description:
Used in a high purity hydrogen containing argon atmosphere to mitigate oxidation.

Text:
Radiative rates are extracted from 
photoluminescence (PL) transients recorded using timecorre
lated singlephoton counting, and single dot PL linewidths are 
measured by singledot spectroscopy. Finally, powerdepend
ent charge carrier recombination is investigated using transient 
absorption spectroscopy which allows to extract biexciton life
times and Auger constants. Results and discussion. A size series of InP CQDs is prepared 
following reported procedures but conducting the syntheses un
der a hydrogen containing argon atmosphere of high purity in 
order to mitigate oxidation.6 While bulk InP has a band gap of 
ca. 1.33 eV, the InP CQDs studied in this work exhibit first
absorptionpeakenergies (E1s) in the range of 2.0 to 2.7 eV (620 
to 460 nm), and thus cover a considerable portion of the visible 
spectrum.
