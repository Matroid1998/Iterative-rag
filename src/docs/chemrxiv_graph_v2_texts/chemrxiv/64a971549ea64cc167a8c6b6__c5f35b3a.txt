Description:
Used as attachment sites for COVID with lower selectivity than antibody-based systems.

Text:
the human bronchial and alveolar epithelia interact with and are colonised by different influenza viruses.7 
Biosensing or diagnostics using glycan sequences as targets is limited by glycan crossreactivities, for 
example using sialic acids or heparan sulfates as attachment sites for COVID, which have lower selectivity 
than antibodybased systems.8, 9 This raises the challenge as to how one can develop small molecule probes 
for diagnostics or therapeutics that can distinguish between the interactions of different proteins with the 
same glycan. The contributions of individual noncovalent interactions of proteins are routinely studied using site
directed mutagenesis.
