Description:
The most active catalyst for CO2 conversion to methane at mild process conditions.

Text:
Thus, the implementation of polymeric reactors for applications 
32 
beyond earth comes with the challenge of suitable and robust catalysts. 33 
We have recently demonstrated the viability of a polymeric reactor 9 for use in the lowtemperature 
34 
conversion of CO2 to Methane, as well as identified RuTiO2 as the most active catalyst at mild process 
35 
conditions 10. In this study, we expand our previous work by using a RuTiO2 catalyst in both a PTFE 
36 
and PFA based reactor and measure the activity and temperature throughout a wide range of process
