Description:
Stable as a diatomic molecule at ambient conditions.

Text:
While at 1 atm sodium possesses a 3s1 valence configuration, under highpressure
the energies associated with its s, p and d electronic states are reorganized
(Figure 1),
so that projecting sodiums valence bands onto atomic orbitals reveals a high degree of p
and d mixing with the broad sbased bands. It is this energetic reordering of the orbitals
that changes the chemical bonding, crystalline structure, and properties of this prototypical
1 atm nearlyfreeelectron metal.6,7
Sodiums behavior is not unique; all elements undergo some modification of their elec
tronic structure under pressure.8,9 Hydrogen, stable as a diatomic molecule at ambient condi
