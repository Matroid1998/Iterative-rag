Description:
A material that could be recovered through lithium-ion cell recycling.

The frequent 
instability of the geopolitical events, in fact, is impacting the supply of critical raw materials used in the 
LIBs manufacturing (above all Li, Co Ni, graphite, but also rare earths) favouring the soaring of the 
commodities prices. According to the market analyst, a combined total of over 180k tons of Li, Co, Ni 
and Mn could be in principle recovered by 2030 through Liion cells recycling, a value which is forecast 
to grow by approximately 10x by 2042 2. Despite such huge potential of EoL batteries as materialsenergy 
resource, the LIBs recycling is still limited to a capacity that is by far lower than half of the available 
spent devices.
