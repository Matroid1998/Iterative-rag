Description:
The simplest of the unsaturated acids.

The poor management of this WAP stream may lead to unfavorable 
environmental outcomes such as uncontrolled GHG emissions from the disposal of pomace in landfills, 
unwanted acidification of agricultural soils via leachate formation and also the pollution of under
ground waters 6. The utilization of WAP as a biomass resource therefore presents an opportunity for 
value extraction while also circumventing waste management concerns7. The current study therefore 
seeks to investigate the production of AA from WAP. Acrylic acid (AA; CHCHCOOH) is the simplest 
of the unsaturated acids 810. AA is an important product that is characterized by several significant 
end uses such as supper absorbent polymers, artificial leather and textiles (Figure 1).

Description:
Used in the manufacturing of dispersions such as detergents and in the production of acrylic-based polymers for applications like corneal prosthesis, contact lenses, and tissue engineering.

Text:
Figure 1 also 
shows that 42  of acrylic acid generated is employed in the manufacturing of dispersions i.e. deter
gents. In addition, AA may have other applications others including in the production of acrylicbased 
polymers for fabricating corneal prosthesis, contact lenses, and in tissue engineering (these appli
cations are shown as Other in Figure 1) 11,12.
