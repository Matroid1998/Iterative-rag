Description:
Used to afford intermediates that accommodate curved structures prior to aromatization.

Text:
The first CPPs (9CPP, 12CPP, and 18CPP) were synthesized using a strategy where cyclohexadienes 
were employed to afford intermediates that could more easily accommodate the curved structure prior to 
aromatization in the final step.7 A complementary strategy involves the formation of platinum complexes 
as precursors that then can be demetalated to form the CPP by reductive elimination. Seminal contributions 
from Bertozzi et al.,8 Jasti et al., Itami et al.,8 and Yamago et al.,9 amongst others, have demonstrated how 
the synthesis of CPPs can be scaled and how these structures can be elaborated further to generate 
compounds with desirable optoelectronic properties.1016
