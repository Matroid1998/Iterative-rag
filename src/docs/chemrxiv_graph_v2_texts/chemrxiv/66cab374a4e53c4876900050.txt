Description:
A toxic gas formed during the incomplete conversion of biochar in gasification.

Text:
Moreover, incomplete conversion of biochar during 
48 
gasification reduces hydrogen yield and concomitantly increases the formation of toxic 
49 
gas CO, which poses another problem of this type of hydrogen production technology 
50 
(Yokoyama et al., 1983; Wang et al., 2008). To sustainably obtain hydrogen energy from 
51 
agricultural feedstocks, this study investigated the generation pattern of hydrogen and 
52 
other byproduct gases from biomass material (with or without pyrolysis pretreatment) 
53 
during gasification and subsequently found out the optimum conditions for hydrogen 
54 
production. 55 
Zea mays stalk (ZMS) is a widely distributed biomass in the rural areas of North 
56 
China, which has high biochar productivity during pyrolysis.
