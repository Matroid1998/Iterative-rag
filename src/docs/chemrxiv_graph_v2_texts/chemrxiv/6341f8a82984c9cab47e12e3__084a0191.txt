Description:
A hydride-containing reducing agent introduced to organic synthesis in 1947.

Text:
Virtually every textbook on introductory organic chemistry discusses reductions of carboxylic acids and their 
derivatives, such as esters, acid halides, and (mixed) anhydrides, focuses on hydridecontaining reducing agents, 
most notably LAH and DIBAL.1 The former was introduced to organic synthesis back in 1947, while the latter was 
initially used for olefin polymerization starting in 1960. And while their extensive service to organic synthesis over 
decades is secure, their intolerance to air and moisture along with reactivityselectivity issues are also wellknown 
limitations. Moreover, as seen today through green glasses, there is considerable room for approaches that, while 
equally effective, are not only more functional group tolerant but also in line with the times where the overall 
impact on the environment is also kept in mind.
