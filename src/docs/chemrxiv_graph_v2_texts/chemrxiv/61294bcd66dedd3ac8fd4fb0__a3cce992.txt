Description:
Compounds with rich photochemical properties that enable photoassisted catalysis.

Text:
Transition metal hydrides (TMH) have rich photochemical 
properties.1 In some cases, these enable photoassisted cataly
sis. Examples of these key properties include lightinduced M
H homolysis,2 reductive elimination of H2 from cisdihydrides,3 
altered chemical properties (e.g., pKa, hydricity, etc. ),4 and pho
toisomerization (e.g., photoswitch).5 When these processes are 
chemically reversible, it benefits the system in several ways, 
one of which is preventing the formation of offpath photogen
erated thermodynamic sinks. However, designing reversibility 
into a TMH photocatalyst is not always predictable or straight
forward. Phenomenologically, the cisdihydride motif is best 
suited to this end because they tend to exhibit said properties.1 
During the course of our studies,6 we discovered a Ru al
cohol dehydrogenation precatalyst (1) with a nominally onpath 
cisdihydride complex (3) exhibiting reversible photochemical 
reactivity.
