PolyLLactic Acid (PLLA) has attracted significant 
attention in the field of biomaterials due to its 
biodegradability 
and 
notable 
piezoelectric 
properties, 
positioning it as a promising candidate for diverse 
biomedical applications, including the development of 
biodegradable piezoelectric sensors. Notable studies within 
this domain have highlighted PLLAs potential in sensor 
fabrication. Here, Yousry, Y.M. et al. Developed a Shear 
Mode Ultrasonic Transducers derived from Flexible 
Piezoelectric PLLA Fibers for Structural Health Monitoring 
1. This research exemplifies PLLAs capacity for creating 
flexible and biocompatible sensors tailored for structural 
integrity assessment. Additionally, Curry, E.J., et al. contributed to this field by developing a Biodegradable 
Piezoelectric Force Sensor based on PLLA 2. Their study 
further underscores PLLAs versatility in the fabrication of 
biocompatible sensors capable of measuring mechanical 
forces in biomedical contexts.

Previous studies have investigated 
various methods to enhance PLLAs piezoelectric response, 
contributing valuable insights into the materials behavior 
under mechanical stimuli 2, 6. However, while these 
studies have provided significant advancements, further 
exploration is warranted to fully elucidate the complex 
relationship between mechanical treatments, such as 
controlled uniaxial drawing, and PLLAs crystalline 
structure. This ongoing research endeavor aims to deepen our 
understanding of PLLAs piezoelectric properties and their 
modulation for biomedical applications 1, 2. This study seeks to address the following questions How 
do different mechanical treatments, particularly controlled 
uniaxial drawing, affect the crystalline structure and 
piezoelectric properties of PLLA films? What insights can be 
gained from Terahertz TimeDomain Spectroscopy (THz
TDS) regarding the molecular dynamics and structural 
alterations induced by mechanical stretching?
