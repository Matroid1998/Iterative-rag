Description:
Characterized by the quantum transfer of H ions and the reorientation of water molecules, known as the Grotthuss mechanism.

The charge transport in electrochemical energy conversion systems involves the diffusion 
and migration of hydrated ions in aqueous electrolyte solutions. The behavior of ion 
transport is influenced by the hydration properties of the ion species.15 Generally, ion 
conduction phenomena in aqueous electrolyte solutions can be classified as following. One if the proton (H) conductivity This mechanism is characterized by the quantum 
transfer of H ions and the reorientation of water molecules.611 It is commonly known as 
the Grotthuss mechanism.12, 13 The other one is the classical ion transfer In this 
mechanism, ion migration is governed by the competition between migration effects and 
friction, known as the vehicle mechanism.14 Friction arises from the viscosity and 
dielectric environment of the electrolyte solution.
