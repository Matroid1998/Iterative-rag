Description:
Doped in Pt nanotubes to reduce poisoning during the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol.

Text:
In a study on the electrochemical oxidation of ethylene
glycol, Chauhan and coworkers4 utilized a platinum
catalyst in a channel flow reactor and observed selective
oxidation with high yield of glycolic acid, compared to
other products. They furthermore noticed low quantities
of single carbon (C1) compounds such as formic acid
and carbon dioxide, and suggested that the pathway to

carbon dioxide production is still unclear and requires
a high oxidative potential to achieve C C bond
cleavage. To enhance the catalytic activity of Pt, Kim
and coworkers5 performed experimental work on Pt
nanotubes doped with silver. They observed that these
materials reduce the poisoning of Pt nanotubes during
the electrooxidation of ethylene glycol and glycerol.

Description:
Acts as a cluster catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene glycol.

Text:
Several computational studies have been published. Salaev and coworkers8 studied the oxidation of ethy
lene glycol on silver cluster catalysts. Their findings
suggested that ethylene glycol undergoes oxidation to
glyoxal when oxygen species are adsorbed on bridge sites
of the Ag cluster. Partial oxidation to ethylenedioxy
