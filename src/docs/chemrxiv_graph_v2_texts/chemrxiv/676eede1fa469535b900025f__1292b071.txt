Involved in dissolution and shuttle effects contributing to chemomechanical degradation.

This promise was bolstered by the low 
melting points of Na and S and the discovery of rapid Naion transport in alumina, which 
catalyzed interest in liquidelectrode systems.2 However, recent advances in room
temperaturecompatible aprotic electrolytes have revived the interest in NaS batteries that 
function at ambient temperatures.3 
Recent NaS systems with heavily cocktailoptimized liquid electrolytes have exhibited 
impressive performance, showing an initial capacity of 1635 mAhg (sulfur weight basis) at 
0.1C, with 56.7 capacity retention over 200 cycles and high coulombic efficiency.4 However, 
even these advancements fall short of the highperformance criteria required for largescale 
energy storage and mobility applications, particularly given the 10 year lifespans now 
standard for conventional Liion batteries.5 This raises the question of whether electrolyte 
engineering alone can overcome the fundamental challenges inherent in sulfurcathode cells, 
such as (i) polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and (ii) significant volume changes during 
redox cycling, both of which contribute to chemomechanical degradation at the cathode
electrolyte interface.

Description:
Involved in sodiation reversibility in battery systems.

Text:
The analogous LiS battery system has faced similarly challenges, 
prompting growing research efforts to optimize the cathode structure and interface for 
enhanced compatibility with liquid electrolytes.68 
An alternative approach involves integrating inorganic solid electrolytes, which could 
intrinsically address polysulfide sodiation reversibility.9 The particulate morphology of solid
state materials, combined with carbonblack mixing, constrains sulfur hosts within a stable 
position, removing some of the risks associated with dissolution. This stability contrasts with 
liquid systems, where electrolyte fluid mechanics makes dissolution catastrophic.
