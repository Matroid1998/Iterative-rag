Description:
Compounds recognized as persistent environmental pollutants with chemical and thermal stability.

Text:
Perfluoroalkyl compounds that contain at least one CF3 or difluoromethylene group 
are recognized as persistent environmental pollutants. Many organofluorine compounds 
have been produced in the chemical industry, as their unique chemical, physical, and 
physiological properties have found various applications in pharmaceuticals, 
agrochemicals, surfactants, refrigerants, and polymers.1,2 One of the most remarkable 
properties of perfluoroalkyl substances is their chemical and thermal stability, which is 
derived from the strong C(sp3)F bonds. However, the inertness of these materials 
hampers their destruction.

Description:
Substances that are persistent pollutants found in air, water, and soil.

Text:
The continuous environmental release of perfluoroalkyl 
substances has resulted in their ubiquity as persistent pollutants in air, water, and soil.3 
Some perfluoroalkyl gases show high global warming potentials,4 while others have been 
reported to accumulate in living organisms, including human beings.5 Therefore, the 
development of efficient decomposition methods is in urgent demand. The incineration 
of perfluoroalkyl substances requires very high temperatures and has the potential to 
produce volatile organofluorine waste.6 Other disposal methods are currently under 
intense investigation.7 For instance, recently, a mild homogeneous mineralization of 

Nickelcatalyzed exhaustive hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl arenes
