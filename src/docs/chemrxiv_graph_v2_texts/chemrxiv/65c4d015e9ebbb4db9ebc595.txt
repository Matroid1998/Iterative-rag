Description:
Constitute decisive intermediates in CH bond activation reactions with transition metals.

Text:
Alkane complexes play a critical role in CH bond activation 
reactions with transition metal complexes. They constitute the 
decisive intermediates in which an alkane CH bond directly 
coordinates and interacts with the transition metal13. Due to 
their low polarizability, however, alkanes are generally poor 
electron donors and acceptors. The bond strength between the 
metal and the alkane CH bond in complexes is therefore typ
ically very weak. Still, the subtle degree of polarization induced 
in the CH bond through binding to the metal site in complex 
intermediates critically determines the reactivity towards bond 
cleavage in CH activation reactions4.

Description:
Can act as ligands in a metal complex and play a mechanistic role in CH activation reactions.

This type of photochemical prepa
ration has been the basis for a wide range of spectroscopic in
vestigations of alkane complexes. Early flash photolysis ex
periments in lowtemperature matrices as well as solution un
ambiguously established that alkanes can indeed act as ligands 
in a metal complex1114. Later, nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) and timeresolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy, in partic
ular, were instrumental in characterizing the structure of alkane 
complexes as well as their mechanistic role in CH activation 
reactions1522.
