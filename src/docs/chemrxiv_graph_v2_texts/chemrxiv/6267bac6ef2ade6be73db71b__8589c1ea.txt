Description:
A chalcogen element that can be part of the E group in NCs.

Text:
One example is the field of colloidal semiconductors, where leadbased NCs are among the 
most explored compounds due to the appealing optoelectronic properties demonstrated by lead halide 
perovskites in the UVVIS and by lead chalcogenides in the IR spectral ranges.6,7,12,13,19 There, the com
bination of as little as four elements (Cs, Pb, X and E, where X  F, Cl, Br or I and E  S, Se or Te) can 
yield NCs of a variety of phases the binaries CsX, PbX2 and PbE,6,7,2022 the wellknown cesium lead 
halides (Cs4PbX6, CsPbX3, and CsPb2X5),12,19,23,24 and the still little explored lead chalcohalides (Pb4S3Br2 
and Pb4S3I2).25,26 All these compounds are often obtained under similar reaction conditions, and can there
fore compete during the synthesis, requiring a careful tuning of the synthetic protocols to achieve the 
impurityfree synthesis of the desired product.
