Description:
A prevalent nutrient for fertilizers.

The global human population reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022. According to the World Population 
Prospects 2022, it will grow to 8.5 billion in 2030, reaching 9.7 billion in 2050.1 This requires a sustainable 
agriculture system with efficient use of water, energy and nutrient resources, a reduction of 
environmental impacts, maintaining economic strength and minimizing dependence on finite depleting 
resources.2 

Fertilizers are necessary to replace nutrients that are depleted from the soil when plants are grown. The 
most prevalent nutrients for fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with calcium, 
magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc added less often or in lower 
amounts as micronutrients.36 Nitrogen is supplied in many forms  it can be supplied alone (e.g as 
anhydrous ammonia, urea, ureaammonium nitrate, etc.

), or in combination with phosphorus (e.g 
monoammonium phosphate or in struvite). Phosphorus is commonly supplied as phosphates, including 
more complex phosphates such as struvite or the calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5(OH)(PO4)3. Potassium, when needed alone, is used as potassium sulfate or potassium chloride. The forms in which 
the nutrients are supplied and when they are provided to crops are important in determining how 
effectively the nutrients are used by the plants. A variety of different sources of plant nutrients are available for use in the form of organic fertilizers 
(manure, alfalfa meal, blood meal, fish meal, wood ashes and waste from water or sewage treatment)7 or 
synthetic fertilizers.
