produced from datadependent acquisition methods on highresolution LCMS platforms may then 
be searched in a highthroughput and automated data analysis pipeline that is independent of the 
vendor platforms used to acquire the data. For the construction of these libraries, commercial 
standards were purchased and subjected to repeated analysis using various LCMS platforms to 
establish classbased fragmentation patterns. Thus, a significant investment in commercial 
standards is required for such projects. 13CTrimethylation enhancement using diazomethane (13CTrEnDi) is a derivatization 
technique created and shown to enhance the sensitivity of lipid analytes by the creation of a 
permanent positive charge7,8. The primary lipid classes that benefit from 13CTrEnDi are those in 
the phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid classes.
