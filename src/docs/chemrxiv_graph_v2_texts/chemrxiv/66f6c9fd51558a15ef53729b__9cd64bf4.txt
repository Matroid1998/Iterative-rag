Description:
Partially substituted with ring-opening monomers to reduce shrinkage stress and improve mechanical performance.

The mechanical properties of printed parts are 
currently not only limited by the material properties but also by the layerbylayer printing technique, which 
typically causes earlier material failure compared to bulkcured parts without this layering effect. In a first step towards better material properties for vat photopolymerized objects, epoxides or oxetanes 
were copolymerized with (meth)acrylates.69 While the reactivity of pure epoxide resins was originally too 
low to be printed, partial substitution of (meth)acrylates with ringopening monomers was already a first 
step towards less shrinkage stress and concurring better mechanical performance.10, 11 With the advent of 
Hot Lithography, a stereolithographic printing method, which utilizes a precisely heated vat and building 
platform of up to 140 C, the possibility arose to broaden the material chemistry horizon.
