Cations that participate in superexchange interactions when bridged by O anions.

disproportionations);913 (3) cation mixing becomes more favorable due to the similar ionic radii 
of Ni2 (0.69 ) and Li (0.76 ) and the magnetic frustrationinteractions.5,14,15 The superexchange 
interaction between neighboring Ni cations that are bridged by O anions is stronger in a (linear) 
interplane fashion between the antisite Ni2 (upon Ni2Li exchange) and Ni cations in the TM 
layer, compared to the 90 intraplane superexchange between Ni in the TM layer. The interplane 
superexchange also relieves the magnetic frustration that arises from the intraplane interaction 
within the TM layer by providing different exchange paths.16 Many more (meta)stable structures
