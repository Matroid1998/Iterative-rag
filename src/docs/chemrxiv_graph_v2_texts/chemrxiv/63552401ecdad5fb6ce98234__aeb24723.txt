Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries and poses interfacial stability challenges in solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.

Text:
Conventional lithiumion batteries are reaching their theoretical limits in term of energy density and rely 
on flammable liquid electrolytes.1 2 A promising alternative for the next generation of energy storage 
device are allsolidstate batteries (ASSBs), which may enable the next stepup in terms of energy density 
and safety required for the ongoing energy transition and the electrification of transport.2 3 
Numerous solid electrolytes (SEs) have been developed, reaching Liion conductivities of up to 102 S cm
1, are comparable with liquid electrolytes. 4 5 However, the interfacial stability of SEs with both lithium 
metal (LM) and common highvoltage cathodes remains a tremendous challenge and hampers their 
application in ASSBs.

Description:
Can form dendrites during plating, leading to cell short-circuiting.

Text:
(ii) If the SE is thermodynamically 
instable against LM, chemical stability can be achieved if it decomposes into an electronically insulating 
and ion conducting interphase, selflimiting further decomposition and thus effectively serving as a 
passivation layer 4 8 Such interphases, however, may lead to inhomogeneous Li plating which favors the 
growth of lithium dendrites and cell shortcircuiting. Additionally, volume changes during decomposition 
may incite contact losses.6 It was previously believed that SEs could inhibit the growth of Li dendrites due 
to their high stiffness (large elastic moduli) compared to LM.9 This assumption has now been refuted 
theoretically10 and experimentally.
