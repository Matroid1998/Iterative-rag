Description:
An oxidant used in epoxidation reactions.

Text:
of the 
enolic unit on the cyclopentenone part of the molecule, we first 
tried an epoxidationopening reaction. Despite the different 
oxidants screened (H2O2, tBuO2H, DMDO) and in the presence of 
different base (NaOH, Triton B, K2CO3) at different temperatures, 
the desired product 7 was not obtained. We then decided to 
promote the epoxydation step by reducing the carbonyl function 
of 4f to the corresponding allylic alcohol 5 (Scheme 3). It is 
noteworthy that this alcohol is not stable on silica gel and it is 
directly transformed into the corresponding diene. Consequently, 
the crude allylic alcohol 5 was directly treated with mCPBA, 
resulting in a 41 ratio of overoxidized ,dihydroxy ketone 6 
and the epoxide ring opening hydroxy ketone 6.
