Description:
A material with remarkable CO2 sorption capacity, environmental stability, and electrical conductivity.

Text:
Such NCs, 
27 
obtained from pyrolysis, are a class of materials, which has been proposed for selective CO2 
28 
capture or conversion as they intrinsically provide selective binding sites for CO2.1115 In 
29 
particular, polypyrrole or imidazolebased NCs demonstrate a remarkable CO2 sorption capacity 
30 
as well as excellent environmental stability and electrical conductivity.1618 Like CNMs, those 
31 
particulate NCs require additional processing steps to generate complex sensor architectures. 32
