Description:
Used as a doping medium to improve RTP in deuterated TPD.

Text:
developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that showed efficient RTP by 
copolymerization of halogenated and unsubstituted phenyldiboronic acids.49 By controlling the 
halogen doping concentration in this rigid twodimensional material, a Ph  29  was obtained for 
BrCOF7. Intermolecular subunit interlocking mediated by the sodium cations in poly(styrene 
sulfonic acid) sodium (PSSNa) polymers was reported by Cai et al. to reduce nonradiative decay, 
turning on RTP having a FPh of 5.3.50 Hirata et al. demonstrated that deuteration is a tool to decrease 
both radiative and nonradiative rates by reducing the FrankCondon factor, exemplified in deuterated 
N,NdiphenylN,N(3methyl phenyl)1,1biphenyl4,4diamine (TPD), which showed an 
improved Ph of 6.2 doped in estradiol compared with that of 3.0 for the original TPD.42 Ren
