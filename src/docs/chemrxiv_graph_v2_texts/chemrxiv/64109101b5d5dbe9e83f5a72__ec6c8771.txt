Description:
An oxide evaluated as a candidate for low thermal conductivity materials.

Text:
A recent report used machine
learning models to identify a new aperiodic structure transition
metal oxide, Ba10Y6Ti4O27, with thermal conductivity among
the lowest ever measured for an oxide 13. In this paper, we
evaluate two new oxides, TaVO5 and GdTaO4, as candidates
for low thermal conductivity materials and measure their
thermoelectric properties, relating the observed transport to
their structures. II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Machine Learning Algorithm
The machine learning model used to make materials recom
mendations was described previously 12. Briefly, a random
forest algorithm was trained on a combined dataset created
using experimental data taken from literature values, the NIMS
database, and the Materials Project.
