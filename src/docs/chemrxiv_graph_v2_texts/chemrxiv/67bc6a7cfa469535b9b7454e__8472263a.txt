. The azetidine ring has gained significant 
popularity in drug discovery campaigns over the past decade. Today, at least seven approved drugs contain the residue of 
azetidine (Figure 1), and dozens of other azetidinecontaining 
bioactive molecules are now at different stages of clinical trials.1 
Continued adoption of this motif requires new synthetic 
methodologies enabling access to building blocks with more 
diverse functionalities. Figure 1. Small molecule azetidinecontaining drugs. It is thus not surprising that significant efforts have been put 
toward the preparation of substituted azetidines.2 Most of these 
approaches, however, focus on the preparation of 3substituted 
azetidines,2,3 whereas 2substituted isomers are rare.4
