Description:
Have large dipole moments and can efficiently dissociate the salt.

Text:
Here we
show that a good fit on the total loss function results
in good intra, but poor inter relative accuracies. In
practice, this makes it difficult to fit the inter contri
bution which underlies the thermodynamic properties
of the liquid state. Specifically, this paper develops an ML force field
for the binary solvent ECEMC (37 M) of the stan
dard LP57 electrolyte1. This formulation comprises
a mixture of cyclic and linear carbonates because
of their complementary properties cyclic carbonates
have large dipole moments and can efficiently dissoci
ate the salt, while linear carbonates have higher mobil
