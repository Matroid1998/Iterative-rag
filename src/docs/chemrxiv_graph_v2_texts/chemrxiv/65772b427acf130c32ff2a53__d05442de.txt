Description:
Efforts are being made to reduce its footprint by producing and using low-carbon energy.

Natural gas is mostly composed of methane and accounts for 25  of the primary energy 
consumed in the world, totaling 4,038 billion m3 in 2021.1 The current extraction of natural gas 
is primarily sourced from fossil fuels. However, efforts to transition towards more sustainable 
productions have led to the development of alternative methods. Some companies aim to 
reduce their carbon footprint by producing and using local, lowcarbon energy. Biogas facilities 
employ anaerobic digestion to produce methane,2 and methane can also be produced by the 
chemical hydrogenation of CO2 to methane (the Sabatier reaction).3 The former method relies 
on methanogens, capable of digesting organic wastes in anaerobic conditions.4 This process 
produces methane in a mixture with CO2, which requires further purification.
