Description:
Bulky substrates used in DAAA reactions with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.

Text:
In 2016 Guiry and coworkers expanded the scope 
of DAAA reactions to include bulky aryl cyclopentanones (Scheme 1B) with high yields and 
excellent enantioselectivities (99 ee).6 These studies could be generalized to other aryl 
containing related substrates (Scheme 1C). 710
