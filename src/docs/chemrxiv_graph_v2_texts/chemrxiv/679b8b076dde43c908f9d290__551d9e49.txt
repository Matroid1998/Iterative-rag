1) stands out for its antinausea, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, as well 
as anticancer activities 1214. This study investigates the activity of 6gingerol against key Candida albicans fungal proteins involved in 
specific biological functions, including Sterol 14alpha demethylase, which is responsible for sterol 
biosynthesis 15; Nmyristoyltransferase, essential for protein biosynthesis 16; Aspartic protease, a 
virulence factor 17; Geranylgeranyltransferase type1 subunit alpha, critical for metabolite synthesis 
18; and Dihydrofolate reductase, also involved in metabolite synthesis 19. By interfering with
