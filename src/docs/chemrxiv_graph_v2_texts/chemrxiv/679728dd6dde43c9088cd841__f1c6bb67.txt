Description:
A geometric isomer of fumaric acid, primarily used in its isomerization to produce fumaric acid.

Text:
Fumaric acid is used extensively in the food, pharmaceutical, and 
polymer industries1,2 because of its reductive ability and non
toxic nature. It is primarily produced through the isomerization 
of its geometric isomer, maleic acid, with an annual global pro
duction of 300,000 metric tons.35 Industrial methods employ 
catalysts such as aqueous hydrochloric acid57 and thiourea8 for 
their isomerization reaction, but these processes require exten
sive heating to achieve satisfactory reaction rates.9 For chemical 
conversion under milder reaction conditions, natural production 
of fumaric acid is achieved via fermentation with maleate iso
merase (EC 5.2.1.1), also known as maleate cistrans isomer
ase.10,11 This enzyme, part of the AspGlu racemase superfamily 
discovered in bacteria,12 catalyzes the industrially useful isomer
ization reaction under ambient conditions.
