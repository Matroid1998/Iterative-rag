Description:
Can be part of a closed loop through the biomass cycle.

Text:
The concept of a circular chemical industry is a key aspect of future sustainable societies. Within this context, utilising biowaste as a feedstock is particularly promising as (i) the carbon 
loop can be closed through the biomass cycle,3 (ii) biowaste is often composed of complex 
molecules containing oxygen and nitrogenbased functional groups,4,5 and (iii) a reduction of 
the 1.3 billion tons of biowaste per year, which are globally estimated at present, is urgently 
needed.6,7 
The utilisation of biowaste for chemical production takes place either in the single stream 
specialised facilities, or in biorefineries.811 Biorefineries can potentially handle crude 
biowaste streams ranging from food waste to lignocellulosic waste that come from a variety 
of sectors, such as agricultural, industrial, forestry, and municipal.
