Description:
Highly reactive coupling agents used in electrografting.

Text:
Because of these and other limitations, other surface 
functionalization techniques have been developed. Among 
these, the runnerup to SAM formation may very well be 
electrografting using aryl diazonium salts4,5. These highly 
reactive coupling agents are easily prepared from anilines and 
can be reduced at an electrode, giving a thin, durable polyarene 
layer which is attached to the electrode surface by some 
combination of covalent bonds and sheer insolubility in 
common solvents. Diazonium electrografting, therefore, clearly 
does not produce chemically welldefined layers as does self
assembly, but for most applied purposes the polymeric nature 
of the film is not a major drawback.
