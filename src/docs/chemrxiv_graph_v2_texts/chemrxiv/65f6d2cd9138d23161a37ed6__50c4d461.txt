Description:
A ligand that dissociates following excitation to a metal-to-ligand charge transfer state.

In this light, ironpentacarbonyl (1Fe(CO)5) has
served as a basis for many studies as a benchmark metal carbonyl exhibiting the aforemen
tioned reactivity and dynamics. In the gas and liquid phase, the excitation of 1Fe(CO)5 to a bright metaltoligand charge
transfer (MLCT) state gives prompt dissociation of a carbonyl ligand following ultrafast in
ternal conversion to a dissociative metalcentered (MC) state. With an electronic structure
obeying the 18electron rule,3 the 1Fe(CO)5 complex is stable, while the undercoordinated
16electron 1Fe(CO)4 complex is unstable.
