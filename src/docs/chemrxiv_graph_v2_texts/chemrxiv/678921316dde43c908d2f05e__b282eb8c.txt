Description:
Detectors have a sensitivity range ending at 1100 nm.

Text:
The (6,5)SWCNTs are characterized by an emission 
peak at 1000 nm with a fullwidth half maximum (FWHM) of around 30 nm. This emission lies precisely at the 
spectral boundary where the sensitivity of the silicon (Si) detectors ends (300 nm  1100 nm) and the sensitivity 
of InGaAs detectors (900 nm  1700 nm) begins. In most studies utilizing the fluorescence of (6,5)SWCNT for 
biosensing, singlepixel InGaAs photodiodes2431 or InGaAs cameras17,32,33,23 are used for detection. However, 
silicon offers intrinsic advantages compared to InGaAs as a detector material. Due to the lower bandgap of InGaAs, 
thermal noise is more prevalent in InGaAs detectors.34,35 Additionally, blackbody radiation becomes a non
neglectable factor at higher wavelengths.

Description:
Used in cameras and photodiodes, with low quantum efficiency at 880 nm but increased sensitivity for NIR wavelengths due to a thicker absorption area.

Text:
(6,4)SWCNTs, which emit closer to the Vis at 880 nm, are detected 
more effectively by Si than InGaAscameras despite the low quantum efficiency of standard Sicameras at this 
wavelength.16 In comparison, (6,5)SWCNTs are better detected by an InGaAscamera.16 However, at present, the 
broader adoption of (6,4)SWCNTs is hindered by the necessity for isolation from the chiral mixture.16,36 Si PIN 
photodiodes, on the other hand, are based on a pn diode with an additional intrinsic layer. The thicker absorption 
area increases the sensitivity for wavelengths in the NIR range,37 which makes them interesting candidates for the 
detection of NIR fluorophores in the 1000 nm range, such as (6,5)SWCNTs.
