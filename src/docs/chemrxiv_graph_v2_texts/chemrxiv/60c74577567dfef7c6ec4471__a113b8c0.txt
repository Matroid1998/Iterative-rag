Description:
A material with high hardness, wear and corrosion resistance, and high thermal stability, used in protective and decorative coatings.

Text:
Titanium nitride (TiN) is currently used as a structural and functional material in a variety of
applications because of its unique properties.1,2 First of all, TiN has high hardness, wear and
corrosion resistance as well as high thermal stability, which are of crucial importance for protective
and decorative coatings.3,4 In addition, it is characterized by good diffusion barrier properties,
low electrical resistivity, increased optical reectance5,6 and compatibility with complementary
metaloxidesemiconductor (CMOS) processes, that makes it promising for diffusion barrier and
gate applications,7 solar cell8 and infrared reector9,10 applications as well as a coating for electrode
materials in lithiumion batteries.1113 Recently, TiN thin lms were also suggested as alternative
plasmonic material,1418 exhibiting less loss and providing other practical advantages compared
to noble metals.
