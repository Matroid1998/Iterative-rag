Description:
Semiconductor nanocrystals with a large surface-to-volume ratio and rich ligand chemistry that mediate electronic properties and control exciton behaviors.

Text:
For conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, such as metal chalcogenides, their large surface
tovolume ratio and rich ligand chemistry offer opportunities to mediate the electronic properties 
and control the exciton behaviors via tailoring the ligand layer.1622 It had been demonstrated that 
the compact ligand layer could play roles beyond a passive protective shell and act as an active 
handle to control the accessibility of the semiconductor core to molecules in the environment.23
26 Conjugating the nanoparticle and substrates through a designed ligand linker can selectively 
promote carrier migration.27 By introducing proper physical and chemical interactions, it is 
possible to fabricate hybrid superstructures with nanoparticles and molecules that direct the flow 
of excitonic energy.2833 Through functionalizing the particle surface, researchers have developed 
various biosensors based on colloidal quantum dots.3436
