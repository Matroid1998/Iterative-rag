Description:
A highly stable ion ubiquitous in uranium chemistry, characterized by a linear transoxo unit.

The uranyl ion, UO2
2, on account of its high chemical stability, is ubiquitous in uranium
chemistry. Up to a few years ago, the uranyl subunit had been characterized essentially as a
linear transoxo unit, with very few structures exhibiting Oyl UOyl bond angles deviating
(by few degrees) from linearity.1,2 The underlying cause for the predominance of linear
Oyl UOyl bonds in UO2
2 is the notable participation of the U 5f and 6p orbitals to the
UOyl bond, while in the isoelectronic ThO2 molecule 6d and 5f orbitals hybridize and
favor a bent geometry.3,4 Hratchian et al. 5 and Schreckenbach et al.

11 have also shown that applying physical pressure on the uranylsulfate
system can result in a uranyl oxosalt phase holding a considerably bent uranyl. In 2018,
Hayton has catalogued the uranyl complexes that feature a Oyl UOyl angle smaller than
172,2 to which we must add the works by Car 12 and Carter et al. 13. In this work, the focus is on the impact of bending on the uranyl electronic structure. Indeed the ligand induced weakening of uranyl internal bond is expected to impact in the
