Description:
An antibiotic used as a first-line agent in the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.

Text:
The general cause of TB mostly stems from the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
causing an infection mainly to the respiratory tract, with some cases affecting the 
gastrointestinal tract 1. Before the discovery of antibiotics, TB treatment was mostly to 
rest the body and let the immune system fight the infection. However, some prescribe 
cod liver oil, vinegar massages, and turpentine as possible cures 2. However, TB 
infection is usually treated with a regiment of drugs, with the first iteration in the 1950s 
being a combination of streptomycin, paraaminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid 3. Following the discovery of antibiotics, mainly Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and 
Rifampicin, the survival rate of TB patients increased as a more effective method became 
widely available. Ethambutol inhibits cell wall synthesis, targeting arabinosyl 
transferase.

Description:
Inhibits mycolic acid synthesis by targeting InhA.

Text:
Pyrazinamide disrupts the metabolism of energy and creates an acidic 
environment. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis by targeting InhA. Rifampicin 
binds to the RNA polymerase, inhibiting transcription 4. Treatment plans for TB infection using isoniazid were usually given with other drugs, 
such as rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol or streptomycin, ranging from 4 to 9 
months 5. Isoniazid is classified as an antibiotic given as one of the multipledrug 
regimens or as a monotherapy used when treating latent and active TB. However, latent 
TB is now commonly given Rifampinbased treatment 6. Although less used in treating 
latent TB, the use of isoniazid in active TB is still relevant and widely spread, with it 
being the most recommended treatment to counteract TB infection.
