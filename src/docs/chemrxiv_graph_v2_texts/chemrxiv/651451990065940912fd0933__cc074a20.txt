Description:
A semiconductor that can be directly integrated with wurtzite-type ferroelectrics.

Text:
in 2019,4 wurtzitetype ferro
electrics have drawn rapid interest from academia
and industry due to their high spontaneous polar
ization (e.g., 100 Ccm2 for nitrides5) and the
potential for direct integration with existing semi
conductors such as Si, GaN, SiC, etc.3, 6 One
major challenge for all currently known wurtzite
type
ferroelectrics
(Al1xScxN,4
Ga1xScxN,7
Al1xBxN,8 Al1xYxN,9 and Zn1xMgxO10 al
loys) is that the coercive field, Ec, required to switch
the polarization is several MVcm, which is dan
gerously close to the maximum breakdown fields of
these same materials and is roughly one to two orders
of magnitude larger than more common perovskite
ferroelectrics.4, 11
To address this challenge and reduce Ec, there are
generally two approaches.
