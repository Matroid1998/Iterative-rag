Mercury is a toxic heavy metal encountered in a variety of industrial sectors such as coal 
46 
combustion, oil and gas refining, and artisanal and smallscale gold mining.1, 2 Mercury 
47 
pollution in aquatic systems is especially problematic, as it can contaminate the food supply 
48 
through bioaccumulation in seafood, or lead to contaminated drinking water.3, 4 Mercury 
49 
remediation technologies for purifying water are therefore important, but this is challenging 
50 
because of the high rate of mercury uptake required for filtration applications. High throughput 
51 
is also important where large volumes of water need to be treated.

Description:
Has a strong affinity for sulfur, making sulfur-functionalized sorbents effective for its remediation.

Text:
To meet this need, a number 
52 
of sorbent technologies have been evaluated including activated carbon, biochar, zeolites, 
53 
polymers, metal covalent frameworks, and many other nanostructured or functionalised 
54 
materials.5 Among the many classes of mercury sorbents, those functionalised with sulfur are 
55 
of particular interest due to the strong affinity of sulfur for mercury.6 It is perhaps not surprising 
56 
that there have been many studies on sulfurfunctionalised sorbents for mercury remediation.7, 
57 
8 Among these materials, those sorbents made directly from sulfur are of particular interest, 
58 
due to the low cost and industrial surplus of elemental sulfur.7, 9 Additionally, there has been a 
59 
resurgence in methods to make polymers from sulfur,1014 which has created many opportunities 
60 
for using these lowcost and scalable polymers in mercury and heavy metal remediation.7, 1526 
61 
In this study, we investigated one of these sulfur polymers made by direct 
62 
copolymerisation of elemental sulfur with the renewable terpene limonene.

Description:
Used in remediation processes.

Text:
Our lab first 
63 
reported the synthesis and use of this material in mercury remediation in 2015,27, 28 describing 
64 
its advantageous features. For instance, both sulfur and limonene are lowcost, highly abundant 
65 
feedstocks produced by the petroleum and citrus industries, respectively.

Description:
An element that can cause poly(srlimonene) to change colour from red to yellow, useful for sensing or filtration applications.

Text:
The copolymer made 
66 
from these building blocksreferred to here as poly(Srlimonene)is a low molecular weight 
67 
oligomer that is fully soluble in organic solvents.28 This solubility is useful, for instance, in using 
68 
the polymer to coat surfaces.28, 29 Additionally, at high concentrations of inorganic mercury, the 
69 
polymer changes colour from red to yellowa chromogenic response with potential use in 
70 
mercury sensing or for filtration media that changes colour when it needs to be replaced.28 
71 
Building upon these foundational studies, the Hasell lab expanded access to this polymer and 
72 
its utility in mercury remediation.

Description:
A target for removal from water using poly(Srlimonene) coated on silica gel.

Text:
For instance, the addition of an accelerator or catalyst in the 
73 
synthesis allowed the material to be made at a lower temperature, which reduced byproduct 
74 
formation and increased the safety profile of the synthesis.29 Furthermore, Hasell also 
75 
demonstrated that poly(Srlimonene), when coated on a silica gel support, is effective at 
76 
removing mercury from water.29 However, these studies were focused more on the poly(Sr
77 
limonene) synthesis rather than mercury sorption, so there is a need to understand the detailed 
78 
kinetics of mercury sorption and the scope of conditions under which it is effective. Herein, we 
79 
report our findings on the first detailed kinetic analysis and modelling of this sorbent in both 
80 
Hg2 uptake and desorption.

Description:
A target for sorption in remediation processes.

Text:
We also studied the influence of pH and sodium chloride 
81 
concentrations on mercury sorption, which provided an increased understanding of the scope 
82 
and limitations of this sorbent. These findings helped establish important guidelines for 
83 
deploying this unique mercury sorbent in remediation. 84
