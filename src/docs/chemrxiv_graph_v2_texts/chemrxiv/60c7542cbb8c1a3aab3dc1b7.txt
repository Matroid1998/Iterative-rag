Introduction 
Supramolecular gels are fascinating soft materials formed by 
hierarchical selfassembly of low molecular weight gelators 
(LMWGs).1 Utilizing noncovalent interaction such as hydrogen 
bonding, metalligand coordination, hydrophobic or electrostatic 
interactions, well designed LMWGs selfassemble to form 
supramolecular networks, which show unique properties for 
applications in separation, drugdelivery, tissue engineering, 
sensing and optoelectronic devices.2 Among the efforts to tune 
the gel structures and properties, endowing supramolecular gels 
with predefined cavities is expected to imbue these soft materials 
with additional functionalities based on their potential hostguest 
chemistry.3 In particular, hydrogels formed from the cavity
containing LMWGs are of special interest because they offer great 
promise in biological and environmental applications such as drug 
delivery and pollutants removal, which can make full use of the 
cavitybased hostguest chemistry.4 Most examples of cavity
containing LMWGs reported so far are limited to traditional 
organic macrocycles, such as cucurbitnurils,5 cyclodextrins6, 
calixnarenes7 and pillarnarenes.8 Even though these 
macrocycles provide a welldefined host environment for guest 
molecules inside hydrogels, chemical synthesis of watersoluble 
macrocycles with tunable cavity sizes, shapes and surface 
functionality are still challenging.9 
Coordinationdriven selfassembly can be used to prepare 
cavitycontaining 
molecules 
with 
welldefined 
sizes 
and 
shapes.10 Among them, metalorganic cages (MOCs) or metal
organic polyhedra (MOPs), a class of coordination cages with 
welldefined internal cavities, are potential precursors to 
incorporate cavities into hydrogels.11 By designing reactive 
binding sites on the periphery of cages, MOPs have been 
employed as building blocks to assemble or crosslink with other 
molecular units into 2D or 3D extended frameworks.12 
Specifically, by reacting with polymer linkers, MOPs have been 
integrated into supramolecular gels with diverse properties, 
including 
guest 
encapsulation, 
selfhealing 
and 
stimuli 
sensitivity.13
