Description:
Part of the rocksalt-like orthorhombic crystal structure in Y2Te3.

Text:
Inspired by this chemical space of materials, the
valencebalanced Sc2Te3 was synthesized and found to have   2
WmK.25 Due to the prevalence of rareearth chalcogenide TE
materials, it is, therefore, natural to ask if there are other poten
tially highperforming TE materials within this chemical space. Zhu et al. identified Y2Te3 as a lowL material with promis
ing TE performance in their preliminary investigations.10 The or
