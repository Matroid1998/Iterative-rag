Description:
Used in 3D printed patterns generated by electroplating.

Text:
Both 
electroplating and electroless plating are lowcost and scalable techniques for such applications 
and hence are appealing from engineering point of view 2, 2630. In this work, we analyze the quality of multilayer metal traces fabricated by combined 
CED and electroless plating, in which electroless Cu layer was deposited on 3D printed Ni patterns 
generated by electroplating. Our microscopy results revealed nonuniform regions in the fabricated
