Description:
Produced from ferulic acid.

While their 
concentrations in plants typically range from a few grams per kilogram of source material, they can also 
derive from highly abundant natural resources such as lignin, which is the second most abundant natural 
resource after cellulose.11 A prominent example of the current utilization of phenolic acid is the 
production of vanillin from ferulic acid.12 In the last years, biobased hydroxycinnamic acids have been 
receiving increasing interest as monomers for the manufacture of polymers.
