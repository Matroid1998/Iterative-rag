Description:
Emissions arise primarily from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, deforestation, vehicle emissions, and the burning of solid waste.

With growing energy and environmental challenges, a significant
focus has shifted toward waste gas treatment and the recycling
of industrial byproducts. Converting gases like CO2, NO2, NO,
CO and H2O into valuable raw materials using catalysts is an
ecofriendly approach, widely reported in recent studies14. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions arise primarily from fossil fuel
combustion, industrial processes, deforestation, vehicle emis
sions, and the burning of solid waste. These emissions contribute
significantly to the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere,
exacerbating the greenhouse effect and accelerating climate
change5. A broad spectrum of materials has been investigated
for CO2 capture, including zeolites, metalorganic frameworks
(MOFs), mesoporous silica, magnesium oxide nanoparticles,
hybrid membranes composed of ionic liquids and copolymers,
microporous polymers, and carbonbased materials6,7.
