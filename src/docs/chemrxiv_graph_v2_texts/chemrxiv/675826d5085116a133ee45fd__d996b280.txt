Description:
A redox-active metal used in photoredox catalysis.

Text:
Photoredox catalysis requires a catalyst that is both 
photochemically and redox activetypically a 
compound derived from an organic dye or a complex 
of a redoxactive metal, such as ruthenium or iridium 
(see 
Fig. 1a).710 
Conversely, 
redox
inactiveinnocent metals, such as scandium, which 
have a predominantly trivalent redoxstable state, are 
not directly involved in photoredox reactions.1113 
Nevertheless, 
these 
metals, 
and 
particularly 
Sc(OTf)3, can serve as Lewis acids (LA) that activate 
substratesorganophotocatalysts by altering their 
redox characteristics, thereby facilitating their 
participation in photoredox and photosensitisation 
reactions (Figs. 1b and 1c).1215 For instance, the 
redox properties of a flavin derivative (Fl) were 
significantly enhanced via their coordination to 
Sc(OTf)3.
