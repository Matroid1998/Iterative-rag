Description:
Naturally occurring compounds in biological media that NHCAuNPs are stable against.

Text:
Topdown approaches typically comprise of 
procedures either utilizing strong bases to generate NHCs, the deposition of NHCAu complexes or through the use of NHC
silvercopper complexes as NHC transfer agents.8 Of note is the use of masked NHCs including the NHCCO2 adduct (NHCCO2) and 
IMZ hydrogen carbonates (IMZHCO3), which marks a mild topdown approach to generate reactive NHC species facilitating the ligand 
exchange with metallic surfaces.9 
NHCAuNPs exhibit remarkable stability in challenging biological media bearing high concentrations of naturally occurring thiols, a 
broad pH range as well as oxidative environments, making them suitable for use in various applications.10 They can also be 
functionalized with amphiphilic, biocompatible polymers to endow further stability and processability in both aqueous media and 
organic solvents.10b, 10c, 10f, 10g, 11 Furthermore, distinct conjugation groups can be implemented in the NHC design, facilitating post
synthetic modification of NHCAuNPs towards their final application.12 Given the limited reports of biomedical applications utilizing 
the advantage of the strong NHCAuNP bond,7b, 9b, 13 the development of a versatile NHCAuNP platform with a straightforward 
fabrication protocol for biomedical applications would be of huge value in expanding this promising area.
