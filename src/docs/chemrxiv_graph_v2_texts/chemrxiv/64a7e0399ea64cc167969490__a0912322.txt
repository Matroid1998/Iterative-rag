Description:
A mineral micronutrient with low solubility that limits its availability for plants.

Essential micronutrients are extremely important for the survival of all living beings, and 
encompass substances like vitamins, amino acids or minerals. In humans, micronutrient 
malnutrition causes impaired growth and cognitive development as well as low disease 
resistance.1 The development of micronutrient rich plant crops is considered the most cost
effective and sustainable approach to battle this hidden hunger. 2 Thus, understanding the 
mechanisms involved in plant micronutrient acquisition is a prerequisite for successful plant 
breeding programs. Even though mineral micronutrients, like Fe, Cu or Zn are abundant in the earths crust, low 
solubility limits the availability for plants due to differences in soil mineral composition and pH. Thus, plants have established different strategies to increase their uptake of these ions.
