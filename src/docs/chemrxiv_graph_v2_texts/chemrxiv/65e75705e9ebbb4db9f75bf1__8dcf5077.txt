Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical reduction processes.

Text:
The development of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) has enabled electrochemical carbon dioxide 
reduction to achieve industriallyrelevant current densities while avoiding both parasitic hydrogen 
evolution, which is often observed when using protonconducting polymer electrolytes, and parasitic 
sorption of the carbon dioxide, which is often observed when using hydroxideconducting polymer 
electrolytes.1 A GDE mimics the triple phase boundary of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) used 
for electrochemical hydrogen technologies,2 with the polymer electrolyte replaced by a liquid, often 
aqueous, electrolyte.
