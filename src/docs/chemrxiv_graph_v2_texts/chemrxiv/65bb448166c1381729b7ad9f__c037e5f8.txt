Description:
A high sulfur-weight base chemical sourced from S8.

Text:
Sulfurcontaining polymers have shown promise as 
redox and light responsive, sensorics as well as 
chemically recyclable materials with improved 
thermal and optical properties as compared to their 
nonsulfurated counterparts.111 In the societal 
context, it is beneficial to access these directly from 
S8, which is a megaton scale waste product of the 
petrochemical industry from oil refining (Figure 1 
(a)), or from high sulfurwt base chemicals sourced 
from S8 such as carbon disulfide CS2.12,13 
Consequently, a great deal of effort is currently 
concerned with the synthesis of useful polymeric 
materials from S8 itself or chemicals directly sourced 
from S8.1417 For example, many crosslinked 
polymers have been synthesized in recent years 
through inverse vulcanization which have found 
numerous 
applications 
as 
lenses, 
electrodes, 
elastomers, 
heavy 
metal 
scavengers 
and 
reprocessable thermosets.
