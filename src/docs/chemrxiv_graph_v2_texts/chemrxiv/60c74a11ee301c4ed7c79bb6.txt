Description:
Metals with 38 isotopes, commonly used as labeling metals in mass cytometry.

Text:
While a vast range of antibodies or specific biological markers can 
be easily provided to target a large number of proteins of interest in 
various cellular cultures, limitations in both multiplicity and 
sensitivity still exist because of the lack of available metal isotopes. Consequently, investigations are now focused on finding new stable 
isotopes applicable for mass cytometry to increase the number of 
channels, and thus, the number of analysable biomarkers. To be 
viable for mass cytometry, i.e. within the detection range of the 
instrument, metals should preferably belong to exogenous post
transition elements or to the rareearth family. Lanthanides, with 
their 38 isotopes, are currently the most used labelling metals.

Description:
Elements that form oxides which can interfere with heavier lanthanides by generating contamination.

Text:
They 
possess similar chemical properties enabling conjugation to 
antibodies through a unique protocol.4 However, they have the 
disadvantage to form oxides that interfere with the heavier 
lanthanides by generating a contamination in the 16 channel.4
