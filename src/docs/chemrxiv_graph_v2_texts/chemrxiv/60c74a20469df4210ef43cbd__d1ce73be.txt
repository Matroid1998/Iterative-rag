Description:
Forms complexes with pyrocathecol violet in buffered conditions.

Text:
6 Here, we show that nickel
complexes, bearing pyrocathecol violet (PCV) as a ligand, can be easily formed in buered conditions. 7
These blue nickel complexes can be scrutinized using a socalled Indicator Displacement Assay (IDA) 8
to recognize phosphate or thiols containing molecules such as pyrophosphate (PP) or GSHCys. The PCV
ligand forming the Nicomplex is also a 1,4michael acceptor, therefore a competition with an indicator
displacement assay and a 1,4  michael addition (1,4MA) for recognition may take place. We show that, for
both cysteine and Lreduced GSH, the 1,4MA is surprisingly preferred to the IDA, suggesting that thiol
containing molecules are more likely to engage a 1,4MA than a ligand exchange, even in presence of a
metal.
