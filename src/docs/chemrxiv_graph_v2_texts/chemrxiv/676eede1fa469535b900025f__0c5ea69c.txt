In liquid 
cells, a complex solidliquidsolid transformation occurs during cycling, involving long
chain (soluble) and shortchain (nonsoluble) polysulfides with characteristic discharge 
plateaus.10 In solidstate NaS cells, however, the physical stability and variable stack pressure 
of solid components provide a different, albeit challenging, chemomechanical environment, 
which is similar to the LiS cells.11, 12 Mechanisms for transforming S to Na2S in solid systems 
are anticipated to resemble those in liquid and molten NaS cells but with unique kinetic
