Description:
Exists predominantly in the 5 oxidation state as phosphate.

Text:
In the natural world, phosphorus exists predominantly in the 5 
oxidation state as phosphate.1 Despite this, the element exhibits 
a rich variety of oxidation states and corresponding reactivity, 
making it a critical component to a plethora of chemical rea
gents, materials and intermediates. Both lowervalent phospho
rus fine chemicals and pentavalent phosphorus commodity 
chemicals  from the ubiquitous herbicide glyphosate to the 
foodgrade phosphoric acid in a can of soda  are produced via 
the intermediacy of P(0) in elemental white phosphorus, P4.2,3 
This roundabout reductionreoxidation sequence is employed in 
part to overcome the incredible stability of the phosphate PO 
bond (595 kJmol),4 which resists facile substitution or elimina
tion chemistries that would enable the direct conversion of raw 
phosphate to valuable phosphites or phosphonates.

Description:
A chemical element involved in the reduction of phosphate to P4.

Despite 
emerging alternative processes,5,6 the phosphorus chemical 
value chain relies upon the thermal process (Figure 1 top; 
Equation 1), which employs extremely forcing conditions to 
drive the reduction of phosphate to P4 by carbon coke. 2 Ca3(PO4)2  6 SiO2  10 C  6 CaSiO3  10 CO  P4

 The anatomy of this reaction reflects the strength of the PO 
bond.
