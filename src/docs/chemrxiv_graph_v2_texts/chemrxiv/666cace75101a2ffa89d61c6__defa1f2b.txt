Description:
A refractory metal with the highest melting point and tensile strength among metals, used in plasma-facing components for fusion reactors.

Text:
Tungsten is a prime candidate for plasmafacing components (PFCs) in fusion reactors. Being a 
refractory metal, W exhibits exceptional hightemperature properties, making it an attractive 
material for components exposed to the extreme conditions of fusion plasma 13. Of all metallic 
elements, W has the highest melting point (3422 ), and at elevated temperatures, it exhibits the 
highest tensile strength among metals 45. Additionally, W shows exceptional corrosion 
resistance and is highly resistant to attacks by mineral acids. An important advantage of W is its 
high threshold energy of sputtering, around 150200 eV for Deuterium (D) 67, which helps 
minimize wall erosion. However, erosion could also occur due to unavoidable impurities, which 
reduce the threshold value of the D sputtering energy 8.

Description:
Erosion poses a significant challenge for fusion reactors, impacting the lifespan of plasma-facing materials and overall reactor performance.

Text:
For example, the threshold energy for 
the sputtering of Woxide by D is as low as 65 eV 9 due to the low binding energy of the WO 
molecules. Tungsten erosion poses a significant challenge for fusion reactors, as it can impact the 
lifespan of plasmafacing materials and the overall performance of the reactor. Additionally, the
