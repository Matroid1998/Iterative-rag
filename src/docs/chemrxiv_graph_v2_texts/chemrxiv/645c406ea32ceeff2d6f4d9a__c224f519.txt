Description:
A nucleophile that is tolerated in the reaction platform.

With this in mind, we questioned whether recent work in our 
lab,24 reported concurrently with the Musacchio lab,25 combin
ing HAT with photocatalytic oxidative radicalpolar crossover 
(HATORPC) might be suited to the development of a general 
and mild C(sp3)H amination. Our prior reaction platform in
cluded Ir(pFppy)3 as a photocatalyst and Nacyloxy
phthalimide as the HAT precursor and we demonstrated that 
this platform enabled fluorination of secondary and tertiary ben
zylic and allylic C(sp3)H bonds (Figure 1C). Whereas other 
nucleophiles such as chloride, alcohols, thiols, and water were 
also tolerated, nitrogenbased nucleophiles were unreactive 
aside from a single report of C(sp3)H azidation.
