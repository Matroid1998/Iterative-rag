. Modern organic synthesis methodologies aim to efficiently construct important molecular frameworks 
with the fewest possible steps, optimal convergence, minimal functional group transformations, and 
importantly reliance on simple, divergent, commercially available or readily accessible starting 
materials, while often favoring transition metalfree approaches and using friendly reagents. With 
these ambitious goals in mind, our program aims to focus on the synthesis of important arylated 
molecules, specifically (unsymmetrical) diarylmethanes and diarylketones. 1, 2 
Diarylmethanes and diarylketones have attracted considerable interest due to their unique structural, 
chemical, and physical properties. They are essential in the synthesis of natural products, bioactive 
compounds, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and modern synthetic materials. An important focus in 
organic synthesis is the modular and efficient construction of these scaffolds, particularly their 
unsymmetrical variants containing two distinct aryl groups.
