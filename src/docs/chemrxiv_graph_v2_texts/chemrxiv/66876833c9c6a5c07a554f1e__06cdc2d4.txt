Ptbased electrodes have been experimentally demonstrated
to be among the most active catalysts for AOR due to their
adherence to the Sabatier Principle. 1 Rh, Ru, and Pd ad
sorb nitrogen species much more strongly than Pt, result
ing in faster deactivation due to the rapid deprotonation
to N and the resulting thermodynamically uphill coupling
of N to NN. 20,21 Coinage metals are on the other ex
treme of this spectrum, with low affinity for N, making
them inactive for N2 production. 20,21 AOR is surface sen
sitive, highlighted by NovellLeruth et al., showing Pt(100)
stabilizing NH2 0.7 eV more strongly than Pt(111). 22
Recent studies on mixedmetal AOR electrodes show PtM
