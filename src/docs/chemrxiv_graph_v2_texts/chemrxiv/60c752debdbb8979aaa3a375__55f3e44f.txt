Description:
The narrowest possible zigzag-edge graphene nanoribbons are a limiting case of acene synthesis.

Onsurface synthesis is becoming an increasingly popular approach for the synthesis of novel organic 
materials.13 Performed on welldefined surfaces and under ultrahighvacuum conditions, it has been 
shown to allow for the synthesis of materials unachievable by conventional solution chemistry alone.4
6 One such example are higher acenes, whose openshell character increases as the number of fused 
benzene rings grows.7,8 This compromises their stability and makes their synthesis challenging.9 One way 
to overcome this stability limitation is an inert environment such as an ultrahighvacuum,10,11 which has 
indeed allowed the synthesis of the longest acenes to date.12 However, the synthesis of even longer 
acenes still remains an open challenge in spite of its notable interest from both fundamental and appli
cation oriented viewpoints, the limiting case being the narrowest possible zigzagedge graphene nano
ribbons.13,14 
In addition to the infinite polyacene, other linear acenebased polymers display similarly interesting 
properties, which can range e.g.
