Description:
1,4-disubstituted analogues used to construct N6 coordination environments with different ligand fields.

Text:
Modulating the magnetic behaviour of SCOactive com
plexes by slight changes to the composition of chelate rings 
and pendant units, thereby changing the associated ligand 
field has been frequently shown for many imidazolylimine 
and thiazolylimine coordination environments.2430 A con
sequence associated with the advent of click chemistry is 
the efficient accessibility of various 1,4disubtituted1,2,3
triazole analogues available to construct a range of N6co
ordination environments often providing a significantly 
different ligand field to the imidazolylimine or thiazol
ylimine counterparts.9,1721,3135 Based upon the results of 
these prior studies9,1721,2435, the potential to strategically al
ter the ligand field by incorporation of triazolylimine envi
ronments to achieve SCO under ambient or higher temper
ature was investigated in this study, with the aim of in
creasing the potential for practical application of the prod
uct complex.
