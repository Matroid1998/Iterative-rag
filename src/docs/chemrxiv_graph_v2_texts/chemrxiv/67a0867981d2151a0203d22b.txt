Description:
Used for quickly cooling solutions for storage at low temperatures.

of the desired volume of a concentrated 
staple mix without thermal pretreatment. After briefly vortexing the solution, a desired volume of 
concentrated scaffold solution was added and gently mixed by pipetting and tapping. The solution was 
shortly centrifuged, and kept at 37C to start the incubation. Incubation time for DNA selfassembly 
was stopped when the sample was fixed on a surface for imaging (AFM and TEM) or quickly cooled by 
introducing the solution into ice and liquid nitrogen for storage at 20C until use. For all experiments 
in DMEM (except Fig. 1B), DMEM 5 was used as a concentrated medium and its final concentration 
was 1.
