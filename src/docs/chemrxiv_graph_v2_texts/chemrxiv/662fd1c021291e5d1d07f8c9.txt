Description:
Involved in altering the hydrogen bond network at interfaces.

38
In aqueous systems, Fh typically bears a nonzero surface charge originating from the
39
ionization of the surface hydroxyl (OH) groups and the adsorption of dissolved ions7,8. 40
Oxyanions adsorption strongly inuences physical, chemical, and structural properties of the
41
Fh surface9,10, primarily due to the induced reorganizing of water molecules altering phase
42
stability and its transformation pathways11. Furthermore, Fh surface charge modication
43
through adsorption not only leads to a reorientation of interfacial species, aecting both
44
their adsorption kinetics and diusion across the interface but also alters the hydrogen bond
45
(HB) network at the interface. This alteration in the HB network additionally inuences
