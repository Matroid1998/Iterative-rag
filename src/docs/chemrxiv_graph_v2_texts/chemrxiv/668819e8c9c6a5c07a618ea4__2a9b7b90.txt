Description:
Acts as an electrophilic donor in the synthesis of deoxyglycosides.

3, 8, 9, 10 The direct synthesis of deoxyglycosides, 
which involves the reaction of an activated electrophilic deoxy
sugar donor with a nucleophile (or acceptor), is the most 
straightforward strategy and a number of elegant approaches in 
recent years have been developed,10 including examples of 
dehydrative hemiacetal activation.9, 11 We recently reported a 
catalytic 
AuCl3catalysed 
dehydrative 
glycosylation 
using 
hemiacetal glycosyl donors and acceptors to access 1,1,
linked 2deoxy trehalose analogues with high stereoselectivity 
(Scheme 
1).12 
Although 
glycosylation 
with 
primary 
OH 
nucleophiles was also possible, lower yields (1020) of the 
desired 2deoxy glycoside products were observed with less 
reactive secondary alcohols due to competitive dimerization of the 
donor, even when an excess of the alcohol was used.
