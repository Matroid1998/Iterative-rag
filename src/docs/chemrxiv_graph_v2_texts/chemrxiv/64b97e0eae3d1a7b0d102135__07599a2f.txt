Description:
A reagent used for chemical exfoliation to change the phase of MoS2.

Text:
reported functionalization of MoS2 for 
applications in HER by firstly changing the phase of MoS2 from 2H to 1T through chemical 
exfoliation using nbutyllithium, followed by a functionalisation with aryl diazonium salts
