Description:
A mixture important for environmental conservation in post combustion processes.

Text:
Polymer membranes are a flexible, processable, and inexpensive platform to provide a myriad 
of separations that fill critical roles in climate change mitigation (carbon capture) and resiliency 
(water treatment). For gas separations, polymer membranes have been widely used in the 
separation of mixtures in many industrial processes, including oxygen enrichment1, biogas 
purification2, and postcombustion carbon capture3. In particular, carbon capture processes are 
garnering increased attention to reduce emissions to the environment, and membrane technologies 
offer known advantages such as high energy efficiency and operational simplicity due to flexibility 
and scalability46. In post combustion, precombustion, and oxycombustion, CO2N2, CO2H2, and 
O2N2 separations are respectively important for environmental conservation.

Description:
A gas mixture relevant for separations in polymer gas-separation membranes.

Increasing gas permeability and selectivity in these membranes would allow for 
more efficient industrial processes by increasing the process throughput, reducing energy costs, 
and achieving a purer product810. However, there is a wellknown permeabilityselectivity trade
off for polymer gasseparation membranes7, which is defined by the Robeson upper bound11. Over 
time, advancements in polymer designs have pushed the Robeson upper bound from 1991 values 
to updated 2008 values (and most recently 2015 values for O2N2 separations and 2019 values for 
CO2CH4 and CO2N2 separations12,13) that reflect improved membrane performance. Identifying 
new materials that break this upper bound has driven and continues to drive materials discovery 
efforts for membranes1417.
