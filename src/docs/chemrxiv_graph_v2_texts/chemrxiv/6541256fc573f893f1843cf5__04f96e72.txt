Description:
A vivid blue compound with perfect ordering between SrBa on the A1A2 sites.

Text:
The results show a unique member of the solid solution series, 
Ba6Sr4(MnO4)(PO4)5Cl2, which has a vivid blue colour attributed to this composition having 
perfect ordering between the SrBa on the A1A2 sites, and similar results are also shown for 
the Br analogue, Ba6Sr4(MnO4)(PO4)5Br2.
