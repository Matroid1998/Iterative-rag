Description:
A complex organic molecule observed in molecular clouds.

Text:
The variety of molecules observed
includes complex organic molecules such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, methanol,
vinyl alcohol, ethylene oxide, ethenone 914 and many more1521. Molecular clouds
are characterized by low temperatures and contain icy grain mantles. They also have
relatively high densities in comparison to the general conditions in the diffuse inter
stellar medium (ISM)8, 22. Despite the rich chemistry occurring in molecular clouds,
the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for molecular formation in such cold
dilute areas are still not understood. In the cold cloud cores, icy grains are the major reservoir of molecules as a result of
the short freezeout time scale.

Description:
Present in smaller amounts as an organic molecule in observed ices.

Text:
Among the observed ices, water ice is the most abun
dant followed by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as smaller
amounts of organic molecules such as methane (CH4) and methanol (CH3OH)23. Gasphase chemistry (including barrierless ionmolecule24 and radicalmolecule reac
tions) and gasgrain chemistry are possible pathways for the production of many
of the observed species8, 2528. The formation of different organic molecules in
environments where temperatures are greater than 30 K can be explained via radi
cal recombination mechanisms; the formation of radicals is followed by diffusion and
recombination into larger molecular species5, 29, 30. At very low temperatures ( 20 K), diffusion of some of the radical species may
be limited and different lowtemperature channels for organicmolecule formation are
expected.
