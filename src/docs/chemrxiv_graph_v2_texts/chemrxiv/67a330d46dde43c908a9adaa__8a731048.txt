Description:
Biodegradable materials used in packaging, regenerative implants, and sustained drug delivery systems.

Text:
There is an increased interest in characterizing the microstructure of biodegradable polyesters used 
in various applications, such as packaging, regenerative implants, and sustained drug delivery 
systems.18 In sustained drug delivery formulations, it is particularly important to control the speed of 
the polymerdegradation process because this relates to the rate of drug release. An important 
example of biodegradable biobased polymers is poly(lactidecoglycolide, PLGA), which can be 
broken down into smaller oligomers and monomers that can be easily excreted.
