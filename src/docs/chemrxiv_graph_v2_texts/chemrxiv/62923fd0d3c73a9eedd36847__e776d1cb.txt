Description:
Confirmed by peaks at 932.5 and 952.5 eV in the Cu 2p scan.

of the Ptmodification and polymer inhibitor. (52, 54) The composition 
of the deposited metal film was characterized by Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Xray 
diffraction (XRD). In Figure 2b, the peaks at 932.5 and 952.5 eV in the Cu 2p scan confirm the existence 
of the metallic Cu(0). The shifted Cu 2p32 peak at 934.5 eV and the satellite around 944 eV correspond 
to the small amount of CuO. (60) The composition analysis of Cu shows that there is 25.11 CuO. After 
electrodeposition, XRD analyses reveal peaks at 43.4 and 50.5 appearing on the ultrawideband 
transparent electrode can be assigned to the Cu (111) and Cu (200),(61, 62) as shown in Figure 2c. There 
is no signal for the crystallized CuO in the XRD data.
