Description:
A product formed from the dehalogenation of vicinal haloalcohols by halohydrin dehalogenases.

Text:
Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) (E.C. 4.5.1.) are bacterial lyases belonging to the superfamily of 
shortchain dehydrogenasesreductases. While their natural function is the dehalogenation of vicinal 
haloalcohols with concomittant epoxide formation,1 they are also able to catalyze the reverse 
reaction, i.e. epoxidering opening, with a range of different nucleophiles enabling formation of CC, 
CN, CO and CS bonds.2 This has made HHDHs attractive for application in biocatalysis and various 
examples, e.g.
