A competitive guest molecule that triggers the removal of the supramolecular CB capping group.

of a competitive guest 
molecule 1adamantylamine triggers the removal of the supramolecular CB capping group from the CBSIE2 complex, revealing the 
nascent selfimmolative structure. This decomplexation initiates a rapid cyclizationelimination cascade that releases the loaded cargo 
molecules from SIE2. As a proofofconcept, we capped a selfimmolative methylene blue prodrug SIE5 with CB. The subsequent 
addition of 1adamantylamine reactivated the selfimmolation, initiating the controlled release of the therapeutic photosensitizer and 
ondemand activating photodynamic therapy for cell killing.
