Carbon monoxide (CO) serves as a crucial indicator of the intricate interplay between global 
warming, carbon emissions, and environmental pollution. Its significance lies in its dual role as both a 
contributor to climate change and a potent air pollutant. Firstly, CO is a byproduct of incomplete combustion processes, primarily stemming from the 
burning of fossil fuels in vehicles and industrial activities. These emissions contribute to the overall 
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which is a primary greenhouse gas 
responsible for trapping heat in the Earths atmosphere (Yue et al., 2015).
