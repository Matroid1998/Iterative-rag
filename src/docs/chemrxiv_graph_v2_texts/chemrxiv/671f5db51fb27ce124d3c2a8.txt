Description:
Oxidizing electron-rich sulfur atoms to electron-deficient sulfones.

Text:
In 
this case, three GNRs (AR11, AR17, and AR23) with 
multiple edge structures were achieved (the numbering 
indicates the number of longitudinally fused rings along 
their backbone) (Figure 1a). Oxidizing electronrich sulfur 
atoms to electrondeficient sulfones yielded ARO11 and 
ARO17 with high efficiency, respectively. Detailed 
theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that 
length and oxidation state greatly affects not only molecular 
conformations 
but 
also 
electronic 
structures 
and 
photophysical properties.
