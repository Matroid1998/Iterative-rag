Description:
Used in nitroxide-mediated polymerization, a type of controlled free radical polymerization.

Text:
Highly ordered material can be obtained by better control over the polymer 
backbone. To achieve this, a variety of synthetic approaches were explored, controlled free 
radical polymerization is most important in polymer chemistry, living polymerization techniques 
afford control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, architecture, and 
functionalities of the resulting polymer. Three commonly used controlled free radical 
polymerizations 1. Nitroxidemediated polymerization1 (NMP), 2. Atom transfer radical 
polymerization2 (ATRP), and 3. Reversible addition fragmentation techniques37 (RAFT). RAFT 
polymerization has received increasing attention in recent years, because it works with the 
greatest range of vinyl monomers and under a wide variety of experimental conditions. Little

work has been done for the synthesis of novel trithiocarbonate and dithioester for RAFT 
polymerization.
