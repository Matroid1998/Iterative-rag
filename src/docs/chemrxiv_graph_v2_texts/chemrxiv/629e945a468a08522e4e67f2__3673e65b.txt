Description:
Used as a cathode material in lithium-ion batteries.

Thus, the EV recharge times are not 
comparable to refueling times of gasolinepowered internal combustion engine vehicles. Consequently, there is a global push to enable extreme fast charging (XFC)3 that would reduce 
LIB charging times to 1015 minutes for 80 of the pack capacity, increase the charging power 
to 400 kW, and enable 20 miles min1 charging or faster. Current LIB technology containing graphite anodes, transition metal oxide cathodes, and liquid 
electrolytes cannot achieve these XFC goals without significant capacity loss over battery cycling.
