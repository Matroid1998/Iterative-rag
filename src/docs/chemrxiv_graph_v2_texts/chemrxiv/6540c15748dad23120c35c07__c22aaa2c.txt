Description:
Substoichiometric whiskers formed from the oxidation of tungsten filament.

Text:
A similar study33 has been done based on the oxidation 
of tungsten filament to substoichiometric tungsten oxide whiskers with characterization and 
material properties testing performed entirely insitu in the electron microscope chamber. Electrospinning3436 is a versatile and accessible method for the production of submicron 
and nanoscopic fibers from organic polymers and inorganic compounds with a valuable 
extension to the industrial production of many highend materials and products. There are
