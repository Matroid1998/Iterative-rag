Description:
A metal-organic polyhedron that can be deprotonated and exhibits permanent porosity, useful in gas sorption and catalysis.

Text:
When heating the deprotonated MOP, 
NaxRh24(Obdc)x(OHbdc)24x, to induce gelation, the MOP was found 
to partially decompose, affecting the mechanical property of the 
resulting gels. By applying a postsynthetic deprotonation strategy, we 
show that the deprotonation degree of the MOP can be altered after 
the gel formation without serious decomposition of the MOPs. Gas 
sorption measurements confirmed the permanent porosity of the 
corresponding aerogels obtained from these MOPbased hydrogels, 
showing potentials for applications in gas sorption and catalysis.
