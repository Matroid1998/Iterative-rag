21
used in diabetic patients, and gold benefited by reducing inflammation 1. For example, it was

discovered that cisdiamminedichloridoplatinum(II) (cisplatin) treatment for cancer and its cyto
23
toxic effect in the late 1960s 2. After FDA approval in 1978, it has been utilised to treat several
24
cancers, especially bladder, testicles and ovaries. The rate of accomplished treatment with cis
25
platin is over 90 for patients having testicular cancer 3, 4. However, cisplatin has been suffering
26
from limitations, such as neurotoxicity, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which results in painful
27
treatment and restricts the usage of cisplatin 5.
