Description:
A class of compounds used as sorbents in direct air capture to extract CO2 from ultradilute sources.

The growing anthropogenic CO2 emission to the atmosphere over the past decades has raised
a series of concerns over its environmental impacts,1 such as global warming2 and food
security.3 Among the existing technologies to attack this problem, direct air capture (DAC)
can effectively reduce the current amount of CO2 already present in air and is specially
suitable to remove distributed emission of CO2 (from transportation vehicles, for example).4
DAC employs highly efficient sorbents to extract CO2 from ultradilute sources (such as
ambient air), and the extracted CO2 can be further coupled with geological sequestration5
or conversion into valueadded products.6
An increasingly popular class of DAC sorbents consists of amines supported into solid
matrices.
