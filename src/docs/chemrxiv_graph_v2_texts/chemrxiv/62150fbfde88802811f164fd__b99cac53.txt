Description:
A complex analyzed for metal-metal bonding through high-level computational calculations.

Text:
The Xray data is available just for the neutral 
structure. Thus, there is little information regarding the nature of the metalmetal bonding in the oxidized 
and reduced species from electrochemistry and DFT calculations.6a,b Hight level computational calculations 
offer fundamental insight into the nature of metalmetal bonding in the neutral, oxidized, and reduced 
species of the ReTpMePC2011 and the OsTpMePC2011 complexes. However, rationalizing the 
nature of metalmetal bonding is challengeable from theoretical perspectives.7 
The most popular computational method is DFT. It has been used for dealing with large systems, in 
particular, those that contain transition metals.
