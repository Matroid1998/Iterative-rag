Description:
Pivotal structures within natural products and synthetic building blocks.

Text:
Cyclic amines, particularly pyrrolidines, stand as pivotal struc
tures within both natural products and synthetic building 
blocks, serving as cornerstones in the synthesis of myriad N
containing molecules, profound biological and medicinal rele
vance (Figure 1A).1 Historically, the chemical transformation 
of these motifs has enriched the synthetic toolkit, offering a 
cascade of valuable derivatives ranging for therapeutics to 
biological agents.

Description:
Can be formed from pyrrolidine frameworks through insertion or contraction reactions.

Recently, peripheral functionalization 
through latestage CH functionalization has become a mod
ern and popular method, offering versatile and efficient ways 
to embellish these amines.27 In contrast to such peripheral 
functionalization, skeletal remodeling, which involves de
construction and reediting the core ring structure, has recently 
garnered significant attention as a new approach in organic 
synthesis.813 Skeletal remodeling can be divided into two 
phases the cleavage of inert bonds and further transformations. This allows for the conversion of pyrrolidine frameworks into 
differentsized cyclic amines through insertion or contraction 
reactions, or into carbocycles through replacement reactions.
