Description:
An ionic compound used to speed up mechanochemical synthesis and enhance crystallinity of products.

Text:
In a 
mechanochemical synthesis, chemical reactions are induced by grinding of a metal salt and linker 
in a ball mill. Adding a small amount of solvent and ionic compound such as (NH4)2SO4 have both 
been found to speed up the synthesis, and result in more crystalline products21,23. Accelerated
