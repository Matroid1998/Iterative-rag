Description:
Relies on fine lateral resolution for trapping microparticles in microfluidic devices.

Their detection is essential for human health, for example, detecting parasite eggs of 
Schistosoma haematobium in urine,4,5 or for environmental screening, for example, the 
detection and identification of zooplankton.6 As a result of their low concentration, the 
sample must be preconcentrated using rounds of centrifugation, filters, or decanting the 
liquid for days.7 This is simply timeconsuming and impractical during infield analyses. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices have been used to filter and separate 
particles of different sizes, especially cells, from various mixtures.812 These microfluidic 
devices rely on fine lateral (XY) resolution for trapping microparticles. For example, a set of 
pillars with an inter distance of 25 m will collect particles bigger than 25 m while smaller 
particles will pass through.

Description:
Used to fabricate microfluidic molds through stereolithography or masked stereolithography.

Text:
For achieving such a lateral resolution (XY), soft lithography must 
be used.13 This means spin coating a photopolymer, fabricating a mask with high resolution, 
mask alignment and UV developing, baking, and washing steps to make a PDMS mold. Unfortunately, this fabrication method is too complex and restricted to laboratories with 
specialized knowhow and fabrication capabilities. To overcome this problem, PDMS microfluidic molds can be fabricated by stereolithography 
(SLA) or masked stereolithography ((m)SLA) printers, more colloquially called resin 
printers.14,15 
These 
printers 
use 
the 
same 
concept 
of 
stereolithography 
Photopolymerization of (met)acrylates using either laser (SLA) or UV light and an LCD screen 
that acts as a mask (m(SLA)). The resin printers are commercially available for home use, 
cheap, and easy to operate.
