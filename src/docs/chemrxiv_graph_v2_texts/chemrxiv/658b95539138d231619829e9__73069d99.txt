Description:
A major source of global climate change due to anthropogenic emissions.

Text:
Accumulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic emissions compose the major source of 
global climate change. While progress is being made in switching from fossil fuel combustion to virtually emissions
free electricity sources, hardtoabate sectors such as aviation and shipping will remain large sources of emissions for 
decades even in the most optimistic scenarios.

Description:
A compound targeted for removal from combustion exhaust, air, or ocean to reduce atmospheric concentrations.

Text:
Consequently, CO2 removal  whether by capture from combustion 
exhaust or directly from the air or the ocean  is the subject of greatly increased attention, as it has become urgent to 
develop techniques that can be scaled up in a timely manner and globally deployed in the real world at reasonably low 
material and energetic cost.1 Even after the attainment of a net zero emissions economy, it is likely that CO2 removal 
will be desired in order to cut atmospheric concentrations toward preindustrial levels.
