Description:
A nonmetallic reductant.

Text:
Nonmetallic reductants have 
been explored and include tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene 
(TDAE),5 bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2),6 tertiary amines 
(photochemically promoted),4h,7 and strained diols.8 Electro
chemical4g,h,i methods for reductive crosscoupling also show 
great promise.4f Although reductive crosscoupling mediated 
by low molecular weight feedstock reductants (H2, 2propanol 
or NaO2CH) would be more ideal, their development remains 
an unmet challenge (Figure 1).9,10 
Our laboratory has developed diverse metalcatalyzed CC 
bond formations that occur through the addition or redistribu
tion of hydrogen.11 In connection with this work, rhodium
catalyzed formatemediated aryl iodidealdehyde and vinyl 
halidealdehyde reductive couplings12b,c were recently report
ed, as were palladiumcatalyzed formatemediated deoxygena
tive Hecktype reactions of vinyl triflates.13 The ability to 
promote formatemediated reductive couplings of aryl halides 
impelled efforts to develop formatemediated biaryl cross
couplings;9,10 however, using homogenous rhodium or hetero
genous palladium catalysts, low yields and narrow scope were 
observed.9 Highthroughput experimentation (HTE) in collab
oration with Genentech was applied to the optimization of this 
process, which has culminated in the first efficient conditions
