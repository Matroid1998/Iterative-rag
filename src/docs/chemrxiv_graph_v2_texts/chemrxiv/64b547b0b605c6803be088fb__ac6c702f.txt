Description:
Enables RT-operable ultrasensitive gas sensors with ppb detection limits and high selectivity.

Text:
This has led to particular progress in the detection
of NO2 1623, with the main competing platforms based on Mo
bearing sheets, i.e., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum dise
lenide (MoSe2), and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). All three enable
RToperable ultrasensitive gas sensors with ppb detection limits, high
selectivity, realtime response, and rapid onoff switching, which is due

to them sharing the same type of atomic structure. Mobearing TMDs
favor trigonalparticle geometry with Mo atoms sandwiched between
two layers of chalcogens. It results in electronic states at the valence
band maximum (VMB) capable of acting as electron donors upon ad
sorption of NO2 24.

Description:
Used in sensor applications with gate bias and illumination for gas detection.

Text:
The comparison becomes further complicated by sub
sequent attempts to improve the sensing characteristics. The gate bias
based solution has shown promising results for MoS2 20, MoSe2 21,
and MoTe2 18, but the voltage used varied between reports. Further
more, studies with sensor illumination have considered sheets of MoS2
22, 23 and MoTe2 19. However, they used different light sources
and intensities. Consequently, it is still unclear which layer holds the
greatest potential for detecting NO2. Sensor sensitivity is critically dependent on the charge transfer
(Q) between the analyte and the sensing layer. This process affects
properties that can be easily and precisely monitored, such as conduc
tivity and photoluminescence, enabling gas detection.
