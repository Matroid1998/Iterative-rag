Description:
A product of methanol oxidation at the cathode in DMFCs.

Text:
Methanol crossover can 
poison the cathode catalyst, leading to increased cellheating, lower oxygen activity, reduced 
cell voltage and power density, and loss of DMFC efficiency as a result of parasitic oxidation 
of methanol to CO2 and H2, at the cathode.710 Present DMFC technology thus uses a dilute 
aqueous methanol feed, at 1M to 3M concentration, to limit the extent of methanol crossover.
