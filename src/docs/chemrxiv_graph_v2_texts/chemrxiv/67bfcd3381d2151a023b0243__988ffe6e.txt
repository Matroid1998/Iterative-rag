Description:
A compound that undergoes low-temperature dehydrogenation to form propene.

Direct methane conversion, 
which bypasses the formation of syngas intermediates and directly produces desired products, 
offers a compelling alternative.13,14 Nevertheless, CH bond activation along with efficient CC 
bond coupling toward selective conversion of methane to valuable multicarbon hydrocarbons 
remains a challenge.1519 In addition, catalysts must avoid deactivation due to coke deposition.20,21 
Singleatom alloys (SAAs), atomically dispersing minimum amounts of an active metal 
into a less reactive host metal, are emergent catalysts.2235 Recently, several experimental studies 
have shown the enhanced reactivities of SAAs for alkane dehydrogenation, outperforming their 
corresponding monometallic catalysts with respect to CH activation barrier and avoidance of 
coking.30,31 Marcinkowski and Sykes synthesized PtCu SAA (i.e., single Pt atom dispersed on Cu 
host) for methane activation to form ethane, ethylene, and propene.30 Hannagan and Sykes 
synthesized RhCu SAA for lowtemperature dehydrogenation of propane to propene.31 Cubased
