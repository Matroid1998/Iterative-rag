Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as part of various renewable energy technologies.

Text:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical process in various renewable energy technologies, 
including water splitting, metalair batteries, and fuel cells. It involves a complex fourelectron transfer 
mechanism, which renders it kinetically sluggish and a significant bottleneck in overall system efficiency 
1, 2. The electrochemistry of the OER encompasses several proposed mechanisms, including the adsorbate 
evolution mechanism (AEM), the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), and the oxide path mechanism (OPM) 
3.The AEM is the most widely accepted, involving the formation of various oxygencontaining 
intermediates on the catalyst surface. The LOM suggests the participation of lattice oxygen atoms in the 
reaction, while the OPM proposes the formation of higher oxidation state metaloxo species 3, 2 
Interestingly, recent studies have revealed a correlation between pseudocapacitive behavior and OER 
performance.

Description:
Involved in the final desorption step of the classical OER mechanism, potentially rate-limiting or inhibiting.

Text:
For instance, the final oxygen desorption step has been identified as potentially ratelimiting 
or even inhibiting in the classical OER mechanism, particularly on benchmark catalysts like IrO2 5 leading 
to the proposal of novel reaction mechanisms to circumvent this bottleneck, emphasizing the need for a 
clearer understanding of OER kinetics. Several strategies have been explored to enhance OER rates and overall catalytic performance. These 
include structural regulation of catalysts through size engineering, defect engineering, field manipulation, 
phase engineering, and heterojunction engineering 6. Additionally, doping of singleatom substrates with 
single atom has shown promise in improving OER performance 6.
