Description:
Undergoes trans-cis isomerizations upon illumination with light in ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Text:
A prototypical example of the photochromic system is azobenzene, undergoing trans 
cis isomerizations upon illumination with light in ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions of
the electromagnetic spectrum.9 Arrangement of numerous azobenzene units in proximity
to each other takes place in molecular crystalls,6 liquid crystalls,10 selfassembled monolay
ers (SAMs),11,12 micelles of azobenzenecontaining surfactants,13,14 surfactantpolymer com
plexes,15,16 and other supramolecular systems and architectures.17,18 Distinct spectroscopic
signatures (such as spectral shifts and changes in absorbance) originating from azoben
zene aggregation have been observed experimentally, e.g., for SAMs19 and micellar solu
