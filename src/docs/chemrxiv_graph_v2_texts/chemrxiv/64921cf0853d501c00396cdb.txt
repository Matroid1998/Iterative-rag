Description:
A small molecule probe used in mapping protein surfaces.

There exist various computational methods to enable cryptic site dis
covery,15 One common approach is probe mapping.3,57 Briey, this technique maps small
molecule probes (e.g. benzene, phenol, methane) to the entire surface of a given protein target. Sites with a variety of probes are binding hot spots, or regions of the surface with major con
tributions to the ligand binding free energy.8 While this method enables relatively fast cryptic
site discovery, uncovering smallmolecules that bind to the identied site in a highthroughput
manner remains a problem. Virtual screening aims to speed up the drug discovery process by computationally searching
through a library of potential organic molecules in order to identify a number of hits that can
be tested in the laboratory for their activity against the desired target.
