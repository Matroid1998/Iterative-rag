Description:
Nitrogen analogs of ketenes that participate in nucleophilic, electrophilic, and pericyclic reactions.

Text:
Since their first synthesis by Staudinger over a century 
ago,1 ketenimines, the nitrogen analogs of ketenes 
(CCNR), have transitioned from curiosities to key 
reagents in synthetic chemistry (Figure 1).2,3,4,5 The 
intrinsic polarization of the CCN bond and the ability of 
ketenimines to participate in nucleophilic, electrophilic, and 
pericyclic reactions make them excellent reagents for 
synthesizing complex molecules, particularly through 
cycloadditions that yield diverse heterocyclic frameworks. 3,6 The reactivity of ketenimines can be finetuned by 
modifying the substituents on the alkene or imine moiety, 
offering a high degree of synthetic flexibility.

Description:
Synthesized using the Wittig reaction between phosphorus ylides and isocyanates or between azaWittig reagents and ketenes.

Text:
Ketenimines 
have been synthesized using a variety of different 
methods, with the Wittig reaction between phosphorus 
ylides and isocyanates, or between azaWittig reagents 
and ketenes being among the most commonly employed 
approaches.7,8,9 Further methods involve the coupling of 
stable singlet or Fischer carbenes with isonitriles,10,11,12 or 
the rearrangement of ynamines through a 1,3shift of a 
leaving 
group 
from 
the 
nitrogen 
to 
the 
carbon 
atom.13,14,15,16 
sBlock metal keteniminyl anions represent promising 
reagents to access ketenimines via simple nucleophilic 
substitution reactions. However, these anions have only 
poorly been described in present literature and no isolation 
has been attempted so far.
