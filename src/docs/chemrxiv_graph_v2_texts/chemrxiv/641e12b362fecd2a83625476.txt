Lanthanide (Ln) hybrid materials with tunable optical and magnetic properties have 
been attractive targets in fields such as optoelectronics and molecular magnetism.13 While 
there has been great success with tailoring the optical properties of the lanthanides towards 
specific applications such as metal ion and explosives sensors,4, 5 thermometers,6 information
