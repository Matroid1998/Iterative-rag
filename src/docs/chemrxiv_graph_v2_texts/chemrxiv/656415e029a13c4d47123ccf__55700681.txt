Lightdriven molecular switches are promising candidates for applications such as optical data storage 
and photopharmacology1,2. An archetypical representative of photochromic molecular switches is 
azobenzene (AB) due to its outstanding photophysical properties, enabling an efficient EZ and ZE 
photoisomerization3. Rau and coworkers already demonstrated for sterically hindered ABs in the late 
1980s that the EZ and ZE photoisomerization quantum yields approach each other when the size 
of the substituents is increased4. These early results, albeit not involving timeresolved experiments, 
can be indicative of faster photoisomerization of twisted Eisomers. In 2014 Fuchter and coworkers presented arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) as a new class of photoswitchable 
azocompounds that overcome certain limitations of AB derivatives, particularly limited ZE 
backswitching performance and Zisomer thermal stability57.
