Description:
Lead-based halide materials used in a broad range of optoelectronic applications.

Text:
Ternary copper halide nanocrystals (NC) have been attracting growing attention as an alternative to lead
based halide perovskites for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.1 Their 0D crystal structure and
selftrapped exciton (STE) mediated emission often lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs)
with outstanding stability at elevated temperatures and upon exposure to moisture. (The term 0D crystal
structure refers to the isolated nature on the molecular level of the copper iodide complexes  edge sharing dimers
of tetrahedral and triagonal planar copper iodide complexes.
