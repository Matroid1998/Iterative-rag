Description:
A synthetic biomaterial examined with various cell lines for in vitro and in vivo tests.

Text:
Nowadays, poly(glycerol sebacate)  PGS  is probably one of the most interesting synthetic 
biomaterials. Over thirty works per year were published in the last decade. Moreover, the number of 
publications is still increasing each year (based on Web of Science data from 19.12.2024). This is a direct 
result of many positive in vitro and in vivo tests. PGS was examined with the use of the following cell 
lines 
 fibroblasts 3T3,1,2 L929,37 SNL,810 human dermal,11 
 chondrocytes,6
