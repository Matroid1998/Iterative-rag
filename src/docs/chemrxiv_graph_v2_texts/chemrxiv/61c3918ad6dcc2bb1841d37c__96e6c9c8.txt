Description:
Compounds modified with alkyl or hydride moieties are catalytic centers for olefin oligomerization.

Text:
The molecules are readily available and can be converted to a wide range 
38 
of useful intermediate and final products.13 The production of short linear alpha olefins (LAOs), 
39 
in particular, has been of significant interest in the olefin industry for the past few decades, as they 
40 
form the key ingredients of various plastics, lubricants, fuels, and surfactants.36 Production of 
41 
LAOs, such as 1butene, 1hexene, and 1octene, through selective catalytic olefin oligomerization 
42 
has, in turn, become a core research topic in the olefin community due to the existence of many 
43 
emerging alternative sources of light olefins and the increasing demand for polyethylene.79 
44 
Presently, homogeneous catalysts, using ligandmodified transition metals, are among the most 
45 
active and selective catalysts for olefin oligomerization.10,11 Among the transition metals, nickel 
46 
complexes are commonly used, where the Ni2 compounds modified with alkyl or hydride moieties 
47 
are the catalytic centers responsible for olefin oligomerization.1013 Many efforts have also been 
48 
devoted to developing heterogeneous catalysts for olefin oligomerization, given their greater 
49 
facility for catalyst regeneration and product separation.

Description:
Investigated in the context of ethylene oligomerization on an SSZ24 framework.

Text:
As an example, reactive transition metal 
50 
species, inspired by analogous structures on homogeneous catalysts, can be supported on porous 
51 
structures, such as zeolites and amorphous silica, but these catalysts suffer from poor 
52 
oligomerization activity or low selectivity to LAOs.1419 
53 
Density functional theory (DFT)based studies are becoming increasingly important in 
54 
elucidating the structures and properties of active sites, as well as the reaction mechanisms, of 
55 
heterogeneously catalyzed olefin oligomerization processes.2022 For instance, a recent first
56 
principles study by Brogaard et al. investigated Ni(0), Ni, and Ni2 supported on an SSZ24 
57 
framework in the context of ethylene oligomerization. The work revealed that the most plausible
