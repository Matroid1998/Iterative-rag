Description:
A core structure that, upon oxidation in buffered aqueous solution, generates a dynamic combinatorial library of disulfide macrocycles.

has demonstrated a synthetic self
replicator capable of exhibiting catalytic activity, but the 
solvents required for selfreplication and catalysis were 
mutually incompatible.17 Another approach used RNA 
replicases derived from the naturally occurring Azoarcus 
bacterium to implement a rudimentary catabolism.16,18 More 
recently, we succeeded in integrating selfreplication and proto
metabolic 
activity, 
where 
catalytic 
activity 
emerges 
spontaneously alongside selfreplication.1415 In this system a 
specific pentapeptide (GLKFK) was attached to a benzene1,3
dithiol core, that, upon oxidation in buffered aqueous solution, 
generated a dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) of disulfide 
macrocycles with various sizes (Figure 1a). These macrocycles 
interconvert through disulfide exchange. After an initial lag 
phase, hexamer macrocycles nucleate by forming a small stack.
