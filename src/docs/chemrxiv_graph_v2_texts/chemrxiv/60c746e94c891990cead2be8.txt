Description:
Materials used in heterogeneous organic photocatalysts where insolubility and lack of long-range order make structural characterization difficult.

The de novo design of solidstate energy materials is challenging because function is defined 
by features that span multiple length scales. One example is photocatalytic solar fuels 
production, where the catalytic activity can depend on a range of factors such as optical gap, 
electronic energy levels, surface area, particle size, and hydrophilicity.18 Organic materials 
are promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen production, but predicting the best 
combination of properties is difficult because the underlying structureactivity rules are poorly 
understood. So far, most studies involving heterogeneous organic photocatalysts have been 
conducted on carbon nitride materials or amorphous conjugated polymers,9 where insolubility 
and lack of longrange order make thorough structural characterization difficult. Consequently, 
it is hard to deconvolute the structureactivity relationships in organic photocatalysts where the 
extended packing is poorly defined.
