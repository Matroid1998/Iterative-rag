Description:
A binary bismuthide investigated for its thermoelectric properties.

Text:
Notable examples are IIV and IIIV ternary pnictides Zintl phases with group 12 
and group 13 elements, respectively, that include Yb14MnSb11 (14111 family), 1617 A5Tr2Pn6 
family (Tr  Al, Ga, In) 1820 and 212 family A2CdPn2 (Pn  As, Sb, Bi).2125 Surprisingly, Bi 
representatives of this class of pnictide TE materials are scarce when compared to lighter As 
and Sb phases,15 and only few binary bismuthides like A11Bi10, A16Bi11 and A2ZnBi2 phases 
have been investigated in relation with their thermoelectric properties. 2426 In fact, IIV and III
V ternary bismuthide Zintl phases are particularly warranted, because the substitution of Sb by 
heaviest Bi atoms is expected to result in lower lattice thermal conductivity and therefore, better 
TE efficiency.
