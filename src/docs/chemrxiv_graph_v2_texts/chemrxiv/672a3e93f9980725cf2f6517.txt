Large early compressive strengths, fast hardening, and high resistance to chemicals and heat make
22
calcium aluminate cements (CACs) a valuable component in mortar formulations for rapid repair, self
23
leveling, and refractory concrete. 14. Furthermore, CACs are included in binder systems for 3D
24
printing applications to accelerate the strength development of ternary binders 59. Understanding
25
the basic mechanism of CAC hydration is crucial to controlling the materials setting behavior and
26
final characteristics. Despite significant efforts dedicated to studying the hydration mechanism of
27
CAC, it remains incompletely understood. Recent investigations focused on a combination of Xray
28
diffraction (XRD) and isothermal heat flow calorimetry to attribute the observed hydration kinetics to
29
phase development 1017.
