Description:
A privileged motif within natural products and organic synthesis, electrophilic enabling reaction with a broad range of nucleophiles.

Text:
Aziridines are a privileged motif within natural products and 
organic synthesis. This ring system is electrophilic enabling 
reaction with a broad range of nucleophiles and access to 
functionalized amine products.1 Aziridines have found extensive 
utility in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products, as well as 
their downstream functionalization.2 Moreover, aziridine natural 
product analogues have demonstrated potent antitumor,3 
antimicrobial,4 and antiviral activity.5 Such properties have made 
aziridines highly attractive structures for applications within the 
pharmaceutical industry, for example as covalent inhibitors.6 
Considering their utility in medicinal chemistry,7 it is interesting to 
note a general lack of diversity of aziridine structures within the 
literature (Scheme 1a). Aliphatic and aromatic substituents 
dominate this space; however, few heterocyclic examples have 
been reported, with Nfunctionalized examples particularly scarce.
