Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction during the electrolysis of water.

Text:
For the electrolysis of water, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) 
is the limiting halfreaction, where the overpotential could not yet 
reach lower limits like they were achieved for the hydrogen 
evolution reaction.1,2 To meet the performance demands of 
scalable and economical electrolyser stacks for industry, there 
are many contributions in literature, which aim to improve the 
OER activity. A promising and economic materials class are 
transition metal oxides used in alkaline water electrolysis anodes. These oxides are studied in various morphologies, elemental 
compositions, and electrochemical conditions.35 One parameter 
out of many that can influence the activity of the catalysts is the 
composition of the electrolyte. Ions in the electrolyte have a direct 
impact on the electric double layer (EDL).
