Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have attracted considerable attention 
as emerging environmental contaminants.13 Within this very diverse group of species with 
varying physico and biochemical properties, the chlorinated biphenyl ether triclosan 
(C12H7Cl3O2, 5chloro2(2,4dichlorophenoxy)phenol, abbreviated TCS or, less frequently, 
TCL) is often named as one species of particular concern.47 Due to its antimicrobial and 
antifungal properties, TCS is not only used as a disinfectant in health care settings, but also in 
a large variety of personal care products, such as soaps, deodorants, or toothpastes, and as 
a preservative in household items.79 Since potential risks to human health, including 
reproductive problems and enhanced risk of asthma and allergies, have been identified, the 
use of TCS in consumer products has been restricted in several countries.7,9 Given the 
persistence of TCS, which is stable to hydrolysis at nearneutral pH values.
