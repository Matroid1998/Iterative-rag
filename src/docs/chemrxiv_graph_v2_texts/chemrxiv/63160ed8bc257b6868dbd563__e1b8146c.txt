Description:
An element present in nalkanethiolates, where n represents the number of carbon atoms.

In this paper, we manipulate EGaIn microdroplets using an atomic force microscope
(AFM) to achieve controlled, ondemand, micrometersized contacts on gold surfaces func
tionalized with selfassembled monolayers (SAMs) of dierent nalkanethiolates S(CH2)n1CH3,
where n  4, 6, 8, and 10 is the number of carbon atoms (labelled Cn hereafter). We rst
fabricated microdroplets of EGaIn using ultrasonication, which we then picked up with a
tipless AFM cantilever. The piezomotors of the AFM allowed us to position the attached
microdroplet in 3D space with nanometric resolution and to make and break contacts re
peatedly at dierent locations on the surface at will, i.e., forming ondemand contacts. The
