Text:
Hydrogen is an important clean energy carrier for decarbonization due to the absence of 
carbon dioxide emissions upon combustion or use in a fuel cell. Although the dominant H2 
production technologies use fossil fuels or hydrocarbons, the development of renewableenergy
based technologies using ubiquitous feedstocks, such as water or biomass, would realize 
sustainable, netlow, or even netzeroemission systems.1,2 The H2 generated then needs to be 
transported to and stored at the point of use.

Description:
Exhibits remarkable gravimetric capacities in metalorganic frameworks at cryogenic temperatures.

Text:
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are emergent adsorbents with pore structures and 
functionalities that can be tuned through the deliberate choice of metal and organic linker to 
optimize adsorption properties.8,9 Such synthetic tunability is distinct from classical porous 
adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbons. Indeed, early investigations on MOFs for 
applications in H2 storage demonstrated that frameworks with high surface areas exhibit 
remarkable gravimetric H2 capacities at 80 bar or higher, albeit at cryogenic temperatures.1013 
Unfortunately, the adsorption capacity at ambient temperatures drops to onethird of the capacity 
at cryogenic conditions in most cases. Hydrogen storage at ambient temperatures by porous
