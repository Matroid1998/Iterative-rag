Description:
A promoter known to increase selectivity and stability in catalytic processes.

Text:
All these promoters are known to 
drastically increase the PDH performance compared to monometallic Pt by increasing both selectivity and stability. All of these pro
moters have been heavily investigated and the corresponding materials were analyzed and characterized in great details. While In 
and Zn are not utilized in industries, Sn and more recently Ga promoters are both already applied in industrial processes.17,25 The 
promoters can fulfill several roles i) neutralization of the support acidity that usually leads to cracking side reactions, ii) suppression 
of metal sintering and iii) minimization of cracking by avoiding deep hydrogenolysis and by easing desorption of olefinic product
