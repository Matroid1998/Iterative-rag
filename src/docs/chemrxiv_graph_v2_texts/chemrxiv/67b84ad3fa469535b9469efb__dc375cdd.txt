Description:
Materials that may display different functional properties due to polytypism.

Text:
Secondly, polytypism is a form of polymorphism found in layered structures in which low 
energy alternate stacking configurations can be adopted by the translation of layers with no 
change to the intralayer atomic coordination4,5. In inorganic systems, different polytypes may 
display different functional properties, such as in (bilayer  multilayer) graphene6,7, or 
transition metal dichalcogenides5. Thirdly, planar disorder refers to translational displacements 
between consecutive layers in the crystal which may, in principle, encompass a range of 
displacements, from welldefined to random. As displacements between layers become less 
random (a scenario defined as orderdisorder polytypism by DornbergerSchiff8,9), geometric 
equivalence on a local scale is restored but the crystals longrange symmetry is still disrupted10.
