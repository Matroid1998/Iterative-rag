conductive polymers like polyaniline can 
reversibly store electrons in redox reaction due 
to different oxidation states.2, 6, 911 
In this study, our purpose is to produce highly 
conductive and flexible substrate as a great 
candidate to be used in flexible electronics and 
smart wearables. This inbuilt conductivity can 
be coupled with environmental stimulants 
where the textile substrate here provides high 
surface area.9, 1214
various conductive polymers, like 
polythiophene, polypyrrole and polyaniline and 
their electrochemical properties have been 
studied thoroughly in past decades. polyaniline 
arguably has the most affordable monomer price
and benefits from various facile and scalable 
synthesis methods among the abovementioned 
polymers.1519
oxidation polymerization of aniline has studied 
by stejskalet al. at different acidity and strength 
of oxidant.20, 21. Kaner et al.
