Description:
A unit that forms part of the structure of borazine, replacing the CC unit of benzene.

Text:
B and N are elements in the periodic table adjacent to C. The substitution of each 
two C atoms in benzene by a pair of B and N atoms obtains an isoelectronic analogue 
of benzene. These isoelectronic molecules have the same 6 electrons as benzene, 
suggesting that, according to the Hckels rule, they should all be aromatic. However, 
the fact is not so simple. As early as 1926, Stock et al.4 succeeded in experimentally synthesizing an 
isoelectronic species of benzene, B3N3H6, named borazine and popularly known as 
inorganic benzene, which is formally a product of the complete substitution of the CC 
unit of benzene by BN, as shown in Scheme 1.
