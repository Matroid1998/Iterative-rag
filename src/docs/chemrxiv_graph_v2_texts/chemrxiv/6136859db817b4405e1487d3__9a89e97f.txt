Description:
Has inverted bands and exhibits high valley degeneracy.

Text:
It is curious however that
band inversion leads to high valley degeneracy in some materi
als while it does not in others; for example, Bi2Te3 has inverted
bands and exhibits high valley degeneracy (NV  6),20 whereas
the chemically similar Bi2Se3 also has inverted bands but exhibits
a single carrier pocket at the point (NV  1).18,19 While band in
version is a key characteristic of topological insulators in the con
text of surfaceedge states,2125 comparatively little is discussed
regarding the consequent electronic structure in the bulk. Here, we discuss the roles of band inversion on the valley de
generacy of rocksalt IVVI compounds using a combination of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, k p theory, and the
tight binding method.
