Description:
Undergoes a metathesis reaction with LiI.

Text:
However, 
coordination of (tBu3Si)2N to Cs was achieved through the reaction with Cs0THP electride solution 
(THP  tetrahydropyran) and the resulting (tBu3Si)2NCs complex was shown to undergo a metathesis 
reaction when reacted with LiI.40
