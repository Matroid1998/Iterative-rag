Description:
Products made from two isoprene units (C10) that can replace jet fuels.

Terpenes and their derivatives are a diverse 
family of biological molecules that provide a rich 
chemical space for finding renewable fuels with 
superior properties. Plants and microorganisms 
synthesize terpenes by combining units of isoprene 
(2methyl1,3butadiene). Products made from one 
isoprene (hemiterpenes; C5) are suitable as gasoline 
alternatives, while products from two isoprenes 
(monoterpenes; 
C10) 
and 
three 
isoprenes 
(sesquiterpenes; C15) can replace jet fuels and 
diesel fuels. Proposals for largescale production of 
terpenes include harvesting them from agricultural 
crops or from microorganisms growing in 
bioreactors 13. The compartmentalized nature of 
terpene biosynthesis provides opportunity to 
genetically engineer favored organisms such as 
Eucalyptus or E. coli to make any desired terpene, 
and to metabolically engineer yields that are beyond 
the natural baseline 4, 5.
