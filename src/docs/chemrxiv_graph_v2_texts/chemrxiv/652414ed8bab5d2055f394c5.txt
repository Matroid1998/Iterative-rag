Description:
Can undergo carbonylolefin metathesis, involving the cleavage and reconstruction of CC and CO bonds.

the 2005 Nobel Prize for the development of olefin metathesis, which allows a 
construction of new CC motif by metalcatalyzed cleavage of two starting CC units 
(Fig. 1A).1416 Catalyst tuning allows to control the substitution pattern and the 
stereochemistry of the newly formed CC bond.1726 

A complementary functionalization of olefins is known as carbonylolefin 
metathesis, which involves the cleavage and reconstruction of CC and CO bonds 
to prepare new olefin and carbonyl compound (Fig. 1B). This transformation can be 
achieved either through PaternBchi reaction27 or via Lewis acidcatalyzed 
CCCO 22cycloaddition2830 followed by oxetane fragmentation.
