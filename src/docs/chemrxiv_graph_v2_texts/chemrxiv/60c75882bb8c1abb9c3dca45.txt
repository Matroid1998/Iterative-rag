Description:
Identified as a modulator of TLX receptors.

Therefore, dysregulation of TLX has been 
associated with mental illness including bipolar disorders and schizophrenia9. Beyond these roles 
in neurological homeostasis and brain function, recent reports have suggested a potential 
tumorigenic activity of the orphan NR due to marked overexpression in glioblastoma and 
neuroblastoma cell lines10,11. These lines of evidence suggest TLX as an attractive target for 
neurodegenerative diseases and malignant brain tumors. Endogenous TLX ligands, forming an essential part of the NR function, remain elusive and only 
few synthetic TLX modulators with limited potency have been described to date1214. In light of its 
obvious therapeutic potential, further evaluation of the receptors function and the discovery of 
potent TLX ligands are imperative. Here, we identify xanthine derivatives as TLX modulators.
