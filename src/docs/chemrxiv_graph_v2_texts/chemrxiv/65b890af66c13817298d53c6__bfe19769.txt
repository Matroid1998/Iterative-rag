Description:
A chemical not conclusively proven to be the causative agent of EVALI.

Text:
There is 
general agreement that EVALI is caused by chemical toxicant inhalation.10 However, to date, 
neither ketene, VEA, nor any other specific chemical has been conclusively proven to be the 
causative agent of EVALI. Moreover, although there has been a significant decline since 
2020, cases continue to be observed throughout the US.10 
Regardless of whether VEAderived ketene is a primary cause of EVALI, any source 
of exposure to ketene may put one at risk for significant lung injury.
