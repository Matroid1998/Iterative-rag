Description:
A mineral micronutrient with low solubility that limits its availability for plants.

Text:
Essential micronutrients are extremely important for the survival of all living beings, and 
encompass substances like vitamins, amino acids or minerals. In humans, micronutrient 
malnutrition causes impaired growth and cognitive development as well as low disease 
resistance.1 The development of micronutrient rich plant crops is considered the most cost
effective and sustainable approach to battle this hidden hunger. 2 Thus, understanding the 
mechanisms involved in plant micronutrient acquisition is a prerequisite for successful plant 
breeding programs. Even though mineral micronutrients, like Fe, Cu or Zn are abundant in the earths crust, low 
solubility limits the availability for plants due to differences in soil mineral composition and pH. Thus, plants have established different strategies to increase their uptake of these ions.

Description:
Insoluble in its Fe(III) form and requires complexation for uptake by plants.

Text:
With 
regard to Fe, two acquisition mechanisms have evolved. All nongramineous plants rely on a 
multistep process including acidifying the rhizosphere, reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II) via enzymes 
on the cell wall and complexation of the Fe(II) followed by uptake into the cell (strategy I). 3 
In contrast, all gramineous plants synthesize socalled phytosiderophores (PS) that are 
secreted into the surrounding soil (socalled rhizosphere where complexation of insoluble 
Fe(III) can take place. The metalPS complex is transported back into the cell where the metal 
ion is liberated. 4 The biosynthesis and secretion of PS is upregulated if the plant experiences 
micronutrient deficiency.
