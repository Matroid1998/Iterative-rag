Description:
An intermediate formed via a three-membered ring oxidative addition transition state.

Text:
Starting from int1, the CCl bond cleavage occurs via a 
threemembered ring oxidative addition transition state TS1 with 
an energy barrier of 10.4 kcalmol producing the palladium(II) in
termediate int2. Subsequently, int2 complexes with (S)2a or (R)
2a lead to an endothermic process of 4.9 and 8.8 kcalmol, result
ing in int3a or int3b, respectively. Notably, mechanistic experi
ments (Figure 2B) have demonstrated that there is a rapid intercon
version between zinc reagent (S)2a and (R)2a. From int3a and 
int3b, transmetalation takes place via the fourmembered ring tran
sition state TS2a or TS2b, leading to the benzylpalladium(II) in
termediate int4ab and releasing ZnCl2. Int4a and 4b undergo the 
CC reductive elimination transition state TS3ab to produce the 
productcoordinated intermediate int5ab.
