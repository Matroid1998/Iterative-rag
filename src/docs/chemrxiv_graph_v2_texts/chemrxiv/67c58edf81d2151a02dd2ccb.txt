Functionalized perylene diimides that self-assemble into flexible charged fibers.

Similarly, 
amino acid functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) that selfassemble into flexible charged 
fibers, could produce different H2 amounts depending on the local packing within these 
cylindrical structures.28 Higher H2 evolution was observed in assemblies with strong mixing 
of Frenkel and chargetransfer (CT) excitation, while the localized excitonic state in structures 
without such mixing led to lower H2 production. Much less attention, however, has been placed 
on how different aggregates of the same dye influence the photocatalytic activity towards 
different products. Understanding such structurephotocatalytic relationship would allow to 
design new molecular or supramolecular photocatalysts, or would lead to more efficient 
photochemical transformations.
