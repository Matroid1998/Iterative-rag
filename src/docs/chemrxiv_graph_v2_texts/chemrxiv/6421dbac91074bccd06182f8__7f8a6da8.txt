Description:
Exhibits low selectivity in some systems but can be selectively captured by solidsorbents with grafted amines.

Text:
They tend to have relatively low CO2N2 selectivity, and frequently show high sensitivity to moisture in the gas 
mixture.11,12 Solidsorbents with grafted amines have also been reported. They exhibit high selectivity for CO2, but have high 
thermal energy requirements for regeneration, and limited lifetime due to the oxygensensitivity of amines.13,14 
Electrochemical CO2 capture techniques have gained considerable attention in recent years.5,7,15,16 They avoid the energy 
penalty associated with thermal and pressure cycling.
