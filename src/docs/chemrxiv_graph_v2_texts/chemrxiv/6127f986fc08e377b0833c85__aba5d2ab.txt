Amide bond formation is an essential chemical reaction in all forms of life that is catalyzed by 
30 
highly evolved biomolecular machinery. However, before ribosomes and specialized enzymes 
31 
became capable of protein synthesis,1,2 alternative, simple prebiotic routes to create peptide bonds 
32 
in a spatiotemporally controlled way likely existed. Protocellular compartments provide a 
33 
promising platform to localize chemical reactions relevant to life.35 What the nature of such 
34 
protocellular compartments capable of peptide synthesis could be, remains unknown. As plausible 
35 
precursors to peptides, aminothioacids (AASH)6 and acetylated aminothioacids (AcAASH)7 
36 
have been shown to be formed in aqueous conditions at nearneutral pH.
