Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds that alter the electronic structure of solutes, impacting photochemistry.

Text:
Hydrogen bonds play a significant role in modulating photo
chemistry because they alter the electronic structure of the so
lute, stabilizing or destabilizing particular electronic states.2,1922
This, in turn, can shift absorption spectra, induce specific confor
mational changes, or impact deactivation mechanisms, reaction
rates, and excitedstate lifetimes.
