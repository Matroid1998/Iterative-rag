Highenergy density, portable and safe energy storage remains one of the most prevalent issues in 
modern society. Lithiumion batteries (LIB) are amongst the most promising options but are far from 
achieving their theoretical performance13. Maximal energy density of lithium batteries can only be 
achieved by use of Li metal anodes, which enable the highest theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g1) and 
the lowest electrochemical potential (3.04 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode) of all anode 
materials1, 
2. However, current LIB electrolytes (usually LiPF6 dissolved in a ethylene 
carbonatedimethyl carbonate22) are incompatible with Li metal, present with safety concerns and an 
inability to accommodate high V cathode materials. Hence, electrolyte optimisation, or replacement, 
is paramount1, 2, 48.
