Description:
Used as a catalyst to access protected secondary and tertiary homoallylic amines with chemo and diastereoselectivity.

Phukan 
demonstrated that iodine could act as a powerful catalyst 
for the rapid reaction of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes 
with benzyl carbamate and allyltrimethylsilane to produce 
various protected homoallylic amines.14 Similarly, Ghorai 
and coworker used a rhenium catalyst to access protected 
secondary and tertiary homoallylic amines with chemo and 
diastereoselectivity.15 Gandhi and coworker used a chiral 
disulfonimide catalyst to create an enantioselective version 
of this reaction.16 These approaches are limited by the re
quirement of a terminal carbamate as the nitrogen source, 
and the latter requires long reaction times (4  10 days). A 
reaction that could broaden the scope of this transfor
mation while also improving in the practicality and green
ness of these procedures would enable more ready access 
to important homoallylic amines.
