Description:
A metal that can be alloyed with Zn or Ga to increase methanol selectivity.

Text:
Nevertheless, these systems
favor the reverse watergas shift reaction and produce signif
icant amounts of carbon monoxide.17,18 It has been shown
that the selectivity to the desired methanol product can be in
creased by alloying Pd with a second metal, such as Zn or
Ga.20,23 Therefore, alloy materials offer a promising strategy
for improving the performance of CO2 hydrogenation cata
lysts. Singleatom catalysts are a frontline approach in catalysis
research.24,25 In these materials, isolated atoms of a metal
are dispersed and stabilized on a host material. If the sub
strates are metals, we identify these materials as singleatom
alloys (SAAs).
