Description:
Forms hydrogen bonding, contributing to unique mechanical and functional properties.

These
materials possess immense compositional tunability, low
processing temperatures compared to inorganic materi
als, and compositions with toxic and scarce elements such
as Pb, Ba, and Co 2328 can be avoided. They ex
hibit a broad range of bonding properties  including
van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, chargetransfer,
and intermolecular orbital hybridization 29  which
gives rise to unique mechanical and functional proper
ties. The key example of a unique property is the exis
tence of a plastic hightemperature mesophase, where
molecules retain lattice order but increase their degree of
local orientational disorder, introducing molecular rota
tion into the structure. In the mesophase the material
has weakened intramolecular bonding and ease of dis
location movement, causing it to become malleable and
deformable into desired shapes 30, 31.
