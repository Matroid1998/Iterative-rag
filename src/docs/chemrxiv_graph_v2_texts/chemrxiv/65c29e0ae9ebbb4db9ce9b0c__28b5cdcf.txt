Description:
Induces necessary deformation to molecular nanocarbons, resulting in a chiral, stable nonorientable system.

Text:
Such bistability is unique to ssM and not possible in the 
dsM molecules.31 This dynamic behavior was previously ob
served in complex porphyrinoids, where the differences 
between (anti)aromatic conformations could be deciphered 
using NMR spectroscopy.32,33 However, a similar experi
mental achievement in topological molecular nanocarbons 
is currently missing. Inspired by the work of Durola and Herges on ssM mac
rocycles made of helicenes,3436 we have recently embedded 
a 6helicene into 7CPP (Figure 1) creating the first heli
cene paraphenylene, 6,7HPP.37 The writhe of 6helicene 
induced the necessary deformation to the molecular 
nanocarbon, which resulted in a chiral, configurationally 
persistent ssM structure with a stable nonorientable sys
tem both in the single crystal and in solution.

Description:
Involved in rapid rotation of adjacent phenylenes as observed by NMR spectroscopy.

Text:
Nevertheless, 
we observed a rapid rotation of the phenylenes adjacent to 
the 6helicene by NMR spectroscopy. This conformational 
change proceeds via a conformer with an orientable sys
tem, i.e., a Hckel conformer, which cannot be directly de
tected by NMR due to its high relative energy. The presence 
of the curved paraphenylene segment in 6,7HPP endowed 
this chiral nanocarbon with unique photophysical proper
ties typical for CPPs and allowed for observation of an 
anomalous circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The 
CPL in 6,7HPP displayed a coexistence of a major and a
