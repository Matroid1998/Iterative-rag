Description:
Involved in CO2 adsorption selectivity for separation processes.

Text:
For 
example, CO2  N2 adsorption selectivity has been used as a key performance indicator (KPI) 
to organise MOF databases for CO2 capture applications on several occasions.24 However, 
for complex, dynamic processes such as PSA, this property alone is unlikely to provide 
enough information to determine the separation potential of an adsorbent.5 For that reason, 
processlevel screening workflows must be utilised. This approach relies on atomistic Grand 
Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to obtain microscale properties of the adsorbent 
(in particular, equilibrium adsorption data).
