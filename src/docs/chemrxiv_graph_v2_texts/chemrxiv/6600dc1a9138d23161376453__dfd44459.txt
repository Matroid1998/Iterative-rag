Description:
Used as a nonbiodegradable ink in the fabrication of temperature sensors.

Text:
In this regard, here we show a highly scalable low cost 
inkjet printing technique demonstrating a completely bio
degradable temperature sensor on a PVA substrate. We used 
biodegradable PEDOTPSS and nonbiodegradable silver 
inks to fabricate temperature sensors and simultaneously 
compared their performance. The fullybiodegradable sensor 
based on PEDOTPSS exhibited good linearity in resistance 
measurements between 30110 C, with a temperature 
coefficient of resistance (TCR) value of 13.2104 C1 and a 
sensitivity of 85.85 C. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
A. Preparation of biodegradable PVA substrate 
The PVA film was used as a biodegradable substrate to build 
the sensor on top of it. The as bought PVA powder from 
Sigma Aldrich was used to make the PVA sheets.
