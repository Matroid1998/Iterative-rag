Furfural, a crucial platform chemical made from lignocellulosic biomass, is essential to advancing 
environmentally friendly industrial processes. It is used in various industries, including plastics, 
medicines, and fuel additives, as a precursor to biofuels and fine chemicals. Its derivatives, 
including tetrahydrofuran and furfuryl alcohol, are crucial ingredients in the manufacturing of 
adhesives, polymers, and other valuable products. Because of their abundant availability, 
agricultural leftovers are the feedstock of choice for furfural production. Furfural is synthesized 
only from lignocellulosic biomass through pentose dehydration. The most commonly used raw 
materials for commercial furfural manufacturing enterprises are corncobs and sugarcane 
bagasse.14.Furfural future prospects is shown in Fig1.1. Fig1.1. Furfural Future Prospects
