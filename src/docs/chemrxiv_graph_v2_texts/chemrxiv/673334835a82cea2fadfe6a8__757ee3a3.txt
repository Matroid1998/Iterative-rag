Description:
Hydrocarbon compounds that often suffer from poor stability.

Text:
The advancement of organic optoelectronics relies heavily on polycyclic aromatic compounds
(PACs), which act as fundamental components in these devices.13 Unfortunately, their
hydrocarbon counterparts, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly acenes,
often suffer from poor stability. Major decomposition pathways, such as photooxidation with
1O2 and oligomerization, are closely linked to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of
acenes.4,5 Therefore, finding ideal systems for organic optoelectronic applications with
tunable energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals, alongside maintaining good stability and
solubility is a highly challenging task.

Description:
Compounds whose stability can be enhanced by substituting carbon atoms with heteroatoms.

Text:
One of the most effective strategies for enhancing the stability of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) involves substituting some of their carbon atoms with main group
element heteroatoms, such as sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), boron (B), or phosphorus (P).6,7 Such
heteroatom substitution not only significantly improves their stability but also endows the
resulting polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds with a broad spectrum of properties that are
unattainable by their purely hydrocarbon analogues. Besides finetuning the electronic
structure, heteroatoms can improve molecular packing, and processability, opening new
avenues for material design and application.
