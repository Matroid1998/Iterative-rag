Description:
Forms reactive species in inflammatory processes to destroy microorganisms.

Text:
Cells use biomolecules to transmit information. This communication occurs in waves of 
biomolecules from a transmitter cell through the extracellular space to other (receiver) cells. This type of signal transmission takes place in many biological situations such as the 
communication of neurons1 via the release of neurotransmitters or in cells of the immune 
system2, which form reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in inflammatory processes to 
destroy microorganisms. The concentration of the released substances changes spatially and 
temporally and is a biochemical fingerprint of the biological state.

Description:
Reactive oxygen species are analytes detected using SWCNTs.

Text:
Thus, SWCNTs have already been used for several bioimaging 
studies18,19 and the detection of numerous analytes such as reactive oxygen species20323, small 
molecules like nitroaromatics24,25 or neurotransmitters26,27, proteins28330, sugars31, 
enzymes32 or bacteria33. Due to their fluorescence in the nearinfrared (NIR, 850 3 1700 nm), 
which shows no bleaching or blinking, they represent stable fluorophores, whose emission falls 
within the biological transparency window34. Here, reduced scattering and autofluorescence 
of biological samples allow for increased signaltonoise ratios (SNR) during detection35.
