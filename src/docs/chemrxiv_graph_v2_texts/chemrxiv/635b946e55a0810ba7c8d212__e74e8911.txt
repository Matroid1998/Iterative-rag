With the everincreasing demand for lowcost, highperformance alternative energy sources for 
37 
transportation and largescale energy storage systems, focus has been applied to the 
38 
development of systems with high energy density. Amongst these, lithium sulfur (LiS) batteries 
39 
are one of the most promising candidates due to their high theoretical specific capacities (1675 
40 
mAh g1); however, to date, the commercialisation of the technology has been hindered by a 
41 
number of key factors which reduce the overall energy density, lifetime and rate performance of 
42 
the cells 1.
