Description:
The deprotonated form of a carboxylic acid group in proteins.

Text:
The pHdependent charge distribution of proteins affects interactions that span the entire gamut
of length scales in chemistry, from the hydration state (1) to gelation (2). The isoelectric point
(pI), where the protein has zero net charge, plays important roles in selective extraction (3),
separation and identification (4, 5) of proteins. Estimating protein pI values from amino acid
(AA) sequences can be done by simple optimization schemes that obtain approximate constants
used to calculate the protonation state of the seven basic and acidic AAs, as well as the
carboxylate and ammonium termini (6, 7). Such estimates of only nine dissociation constants
ignore all environmental effects of the primary, secondary and tertiary protein structures on
individual acid dissociation constants.
