Results and discussion 
The reaction between Co(OAc)24H2O and Hsal (salicylaldehyde) in a basic MeCN solution (see SI for 
full details) leads to the formation of pink single crystals after 3 days upon diffusion of Et2O into the 
mother liquor. Crystals of Co16(sal)16(OAc)1616MeCN (116MeCN) were in a tetragonal cell and 
structure solution was performed in the P4n space group. The asymmetric unit (ASU) contains one 
quarter of the formula, and symmetry expansion affords the wheel shown in Fig. 1. The metallic 
skeleton (Fig. 2) describes a singlestranded, sinusoidal CoII16 wheel of approximate diameter, 
Co1Co1  14.5 . The inside of the wheel is stabilised by sixteen 3, syn, syn, antiOAc ligands. Eight lie in the metal plane, with four above and four below the plane.
