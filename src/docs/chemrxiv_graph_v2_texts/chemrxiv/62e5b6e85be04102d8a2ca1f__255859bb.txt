Description:
Involved in synthesis of (arylmethylene)cyanothioacetamides in a Michael reaction.

Text:
4Phenoxyphenyl decyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) and its derivatives are reported as 
antimicrobials which prevent bacterial adhesion to surfaces 1. 2,4Diethoxyphenyl 
ethyl PCA is involved in synthesis of (arylmethylene)cyanothioacetamides in a Michael 
reaction 2. 2,4Dimethoxyphenyl propyl PCA 3, 2,5dimethoxyphenyl isobutyl PCA 
4, 2,4dimethoxyphenyl butyl PCA 5, 2,4dimethoxyphenyl isopropyl PCA 6 were 
synthesized and copolymerized with styrene. (2E)3,4Dimethoxyphenyl tbutyl PCA 
was involved in conjugate addition of perfluoroarenes to ,unsaturated carbonyls 
enabled by an alkoxidehydrosilane system 7 and in preparation of 
acylaminobenzamide derivatives for the treatment of diseases caused by the 
supermultiplication of vascular intimal cells 8. 4Ethoxy3methoxyphenyl butyl 9 
and isopropyl, as well as 4hydroxy3,5dimethylphenyl isopropyl 10, and 4fluoro3
methoxyphenyl isobutyl 11 PCAs were prepared and copolymerized with vinyl 
benzene.
