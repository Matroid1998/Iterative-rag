Description:
Amphiphilic compounds that can assemble into supramolecular structures for photoactivatable drug delivery devices and light-harvesting nanosystems.

Text:
Amphiphilic compounds such as surfactants and phospholipids are molecules that possess 
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks. When dispersed in water at sufficiently high 
concentrations (i.e., higher than their critical micelle concentration), they tend to selfassemble 
into a wide variety of supramolecular structures with a broad range of sizes and shapes such as 
micelles, vesicles, planar bilayers, nanotubes or nanofibers 14. These organized assemblies offer 
several functional properties with respect to their monomeric counterparts. In this context, 
amphiphilic compounds have attracted great attention for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and 
industrial applications. This is particularly true regarding the assembly of amphiphilic porphyrins 
5 or porphyrinoids 67 into supramolecular structures designed for photoactivatable drug delivery 
devices 611 as well as lightharvesting nanosystems 1213.
