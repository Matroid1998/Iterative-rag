Description:
Involved in the desorption process at the air-lung interface.

Text:
Notable examples include the adsorption of O2 and the desorption of CO2 at the airlung 
39 
interface,1,2 controlling airfuel mixing in internal combustion engines3 and the treatment of amine gases,4 
40 
and the formation of acid rain and modulation of atmospheric ozone.59 Extracting information on 
41 
molecularlevel structure, kinetics, and dynamics at the gasliquid interface requires methods specifically 
42 
geared toward surface studies.1012 Novel spectroscopic and kinetics techniques have been developed to 
43 
address this challenge.1315 Deep ultraviolet electronic sum frequency generation spectroscopy has 
44 
revealed chargetransfertosolvent transitions in anions at the airwater interface1619 and vibrational 
45 
spectroscopy has been used to interrogate formic acid orientation with angstromlevel depth resolution.20 
46 
Additionally, thin film and microdroplet studies have uncovered augmented chemical reaction rates 
47 
compared to their bulk counterparts.2124 This paper focuses on molecular beam experiments that probe 
48 
the gasliquid interface.
