Description:
Produced from the reduction of CO2.

The reduction of CO2 to CO occurs at a slower rate than water splitting for hydrogen due to its multielectron 
0 
process and higher dissociation energy barrier.19 In the anode side, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
1 
is hindered by several factors21,22 the strength of CH bonds in propane, the relative instability of propylene 
2 
compared to propane, excess oxidation of propane to CO2, catalyst degradation under oxidative conditions,
