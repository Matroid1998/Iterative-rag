Description:
Reduced to water by laccase in a four-electron reduction process.

Text:
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2, pdiphenol dioxygen oxidoreductase) is an enzyme belonging to 
the group of blue copper oxidases.12 It contains oxidoreductases that couple the reduction 
of oxygen to water by fourelectron reduction with the oxidation of a wide range of 
organic and inorganic substrates including phenols as well as of some organic substances 
considered to be persistent organic pollutants (POPs), anilines and aromatic thiols.35 Due 
to its broad substrate range and multiple roles, laccase has become a prominent research 
target in recent years.
