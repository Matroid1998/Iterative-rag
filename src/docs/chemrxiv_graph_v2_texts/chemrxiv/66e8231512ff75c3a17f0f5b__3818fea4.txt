Description:
Compounds with photoswitchable low spin (LS) and high spin (HS) states, making them promising candidates for molecular data storage devices.

Text:
Such
properties are, e.g., the photoswitchable low
spin (LS) and highspin (HS) states of Fe(II)
polypyridines10,11, making them promising can
didates as molecular data storage devices12,13,
and the longlived metaltoligand charge trans
fer (MLCT) states of FeNheterocyclic car
benes,1418 which could be potentially exploited
in solar cells and photoctalysts. 1
