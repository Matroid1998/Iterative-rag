polymer piezoelectric materials, attractive for flexible de
vices such as energy harvesting cantilevers, are based on
the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The piezo
electric coefficient of PVDFcotrifluoroethylene(TrFE)
is d33  65.3 pCN 17, 18. Although piezoelectrics
like PZT, AlN, and PVDF have important commercial
applications, there remain a large parameter spaces be
tween these known materials where combinations of prop
erties, such as soft or flexible materials with robust or
stable piezoelectric responses, are yet to be found. Plastic ionic molecular crystals, which consist of inor
ganic anions bonded to organic cations, are an emerg
ing class of ferroelectric and piezoelectrics that could fill
many gaps in the material property space 1922.
