Description:
A neurotransmitter predominantly secreted by neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens, integral to the reward system and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors.

Text:
Numerous neuropathologies originate from dysregulation in the excitatory or inhibitory 
activities of specific neuronal populations within the brain, including opioid addiction (1). Opioids 
represent the apex of analgesics currently employed in clinical settings. Their mechanism of 
action involves binding to opioid receptors distributed throughout the Central Nervous System 
(CNS), leading to a diminution in the propagation of nociceptive signals (2). The paramount 
efficacy of opioids as analgesics, however, is attributed not just to their role in pain modulation 
but also to their capacity to induce dopamine release. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter 
predominantly secreted by neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens  a brain region integral to the 
reward system and the reinforcement of rewarding behaviors  elicits sensations of euphoria 
and wellbeing (3).
