Description:
Organic functional groups compatible with hydrophilic surfaces.

The seminal 
works about the selfassembly and development of the mono
layers of Sagiv, Nuzzo, Allara, Whitesides, and many others 
form the basis of many functional interfaces and materials.16 
Increasingly, complex and functional organic molecules have 
been used by many others to introduce surfacebound molecular 
machinery, optical properties, and binding sites for biomole
cules, for example.715 The binding of molecules from the gas 
phase or solution onto solid support is a frequently used ap
proach to form nanostructures and thin films.1621 There is an 
excellent compatibility of many organic functional groups with 
diverse substrate surfaces (e.g., alkyl thiols and silanes with me
tallic and hydrophilic surfaces, respectively).22, 23 Most thin 
films consist of only one molecular component.
