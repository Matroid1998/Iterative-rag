of ingap Se states to the electronic structure. The material CaBi3O4Cl3 is 
also synthesized, revealing the separate effects on the crystal structure of the anion and cation 
composition. This work presents aliovalent anion substitution in multiple anion materials as a 
strategy for tuning between narrow and wide gap materials, with properties showing more 
than one optical transition achievable at intermediate compositions. Introduction 
Multiple anion, or heteroanionic, materials are a class of compounds that have two or more 
anion species. This chemistry allows for complex packings of the anion sublattices as well as 
diversity of the chemical bond types compared to single anion materials, facilitating 
properties such as superconductivity1, superionic transport2, low thermal conductivity35, 
catalysis6 and quantum magnetism7.
