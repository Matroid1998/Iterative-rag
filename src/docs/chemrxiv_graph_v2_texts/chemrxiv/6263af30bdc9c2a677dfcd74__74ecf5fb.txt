Synthesis and Characterization of Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine (PPcy) 
Derivatives and Polymers 
We first synthesized a series of polymers (denoted as PPCx, where x 
represents the numberaverage degree of polymerization of PCL on 
each side) by grafting biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) from a 
hydroxylbearing PPcy initiator (P0) via ringopening polymerization
