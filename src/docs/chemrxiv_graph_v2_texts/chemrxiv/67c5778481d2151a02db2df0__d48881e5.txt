Description:
A promising anode material.

Text:
Interest in such materials have various motivations Materials 
such as oxocarbon squarate, Li2C4O4, are promising anode ma
terials.20 Others, such as M2C6O6 (MLi, Na and K), are ultra
high capacitors21, 22 and cathode materials.23 Pb3C6O6 is a po
tential photovoltaic material, 24, 25 while M(C6O6) (MFe, Co, 
Mn),26 Mn5(C6O6)2,27 and Cu3(C6O6)2 28, 29 are examples of nar
rowbandgap metal organic frameworks.26, 28, 30 Some oxocar
bon anions facilitate the production of hydrocarbons though 
FischerTropschtype processes.1014 
Several studies have focused on the properties of these molec
ular anions, including, for example, how the aromaticity (or 
antiaromaticity) of anions may vary with charge.31, 32 In con
trast, relatively little attention have been paid to the bonding 
situation in the solid state, where ionic, covalent and van der 
Waals interactions can combine to create unique extended 
chemical structures (see e.g., 3335).
