Description:
A building block known as CUBE, used in controlled synthesis of single-site catalysts.

Text:
Highly promising possibilities arise in the controlled synthesis of singlesite 
catalysts 
from 
the 
wellbehaved 
condensation 
chemistry 
of 
the 
octakis(trimethyltin)spherosilicate building block Si8O20(SnMe3)8 (CUBE), first reported 
by Feher and Weller.6,7 The trimethyltin functionalization provides high solubility in non
polar solvents and supports metathesis reactions with covalent d and pblock element 
(M) chlorides and bromides as well as organometallic compounds, forming Me3SnCl, 
Me3SnBr or Me3SnR as byproducts, respectively. Multiple silicate SiOM linkages are 
thus created by nonhydrolytic condensation, leading to the formation of gels. The 
metathesis is analogous to common protonexchange reactions. However, due to the 
relatively low reactivity and weak coordinating nature of the Me3SnOSi moiety, it is 
highly compatible with other functional groups and ligands.
