Description:
A raw mineral used in cement production that releases CO2 during calcination.

Text:
Most of the emissions, up to 60,
26
are intrinsic to the material.2 The raw minerals, mainly clays and limestone, are melted at
27
high temperatures to form the clinker phases calcium silicate and aluminate phases, which
28
mixed with other components such as gypsum and additives, form the cement. During
29
melting, the calcination of limestone (CaCO3) releases a considerable amount of CO2, which
30
is unavoidable.3 Therefore, the strategies for cements environmental impact reduction are
31
based on Carbon Capture and Utilization or a reduction of the clinker in cement through
32
the use of Supplementary Cementitious Materials.

Description:
A raw material used in cement production, its reduced usage in belite cements lowers CO2 emissions.

Text:
But there is a third alternative that
33
researchers have long pursued the socalled belite cements.4
34
Belite cements (BCs) are, as the name indicates, cements in which the main component
35
is dicalcium silicate (also known as belite or C2S in cement chemistry notation), in contrast
36
to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in which tricalcium silicate or alite predominates. Due
37
to its lower Ca content, BCs require less limestone, reducing by up to 13 the OPC CO2
38
emissions upon calcination. Furthermore, the sintering temperature is lower, also reducing
39
fuel consumption.
