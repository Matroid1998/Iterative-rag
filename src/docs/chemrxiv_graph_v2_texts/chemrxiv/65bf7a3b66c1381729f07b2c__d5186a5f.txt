Description:
A stiff and brittle material whose biodegradability can be tailored for specific applications.

While PBS holds 
promise across a spectrum of applications, the study of its biodegradability must be approached with 
precision, given its potential influence on diverse fields of use. Consequently, the assessment of PBS 
degradation should be tailored to align with its specific application domains. Since the neat PBS is stiff and 
brittle material10, 11, it limits its application in certain biomedical contexts. To overcome this limitation, 
PBSbased copolymers are becoming more important since they offer easy modification of thermal and 
mechanical properties, and the rate of biodegradation can be easily altered by the type and amount of co
monomeric unit(s). PBSbased copolymers are usually synthesized by polycondensation reaction by 
introducing different buildingblocks.
