Description:
A class of compounds with an inverted gap between the lowest excited singlet and triplet states.

Text:
The efficiency of organic molecular emitters is limited by inter
system crossing (ISC) into lowlying nonemissive triplet states,
which are favored over the emissive singlet states due to spin
statistics1,2 The triplet states are furthermore favored energeti
cally over singlets with the same electron configuration in accor
dance with Hunds rule, thereby making reverse ISC (RISC) less
efficient (E(S1T1)  0, Figure 1a).3,4 Recently, it was discovered
that the gap between the lowest excited singlet (S1) and triplet
(T1) states of a class of azaphenalenes is inverted (E(S1T1)  0,
Figure 1a).57 RISC is more efficient than ISC in cyclazine and
heptazine because S1 is thermodynamically favored over T1, as
shown in Figure 1b.79 Violations of Hunds rule can occur when
the exchange interaction is minimized by reducing the overlap
between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbitals (HOMO and LUMO).58 As standard density functional
theorybased methods struggle with Hunds rule violations,6,916
azaphenalenes were only recently identified as inverted gap emit
ters using coupled cluster methods.57,1719
