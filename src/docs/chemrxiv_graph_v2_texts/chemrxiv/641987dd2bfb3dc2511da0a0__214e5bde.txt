Description:
Isoelectronic with carbon with respect to the valence shell.

Text:
Diamond, known mainly in the cubic form, has a less common hexagonal form called lonsdaleite. Such structures are also observed in binary SiC, and the different phases are called polytypes, which 
are distinguished by the stacking of layers, usually labeled ABC AB in 2H (2 layers; hexagonal 
system), ABC in 3C (3 layers; cubic system), ABCB in 4H (4 layers; hexagonal system), etc. 1. Silicon and carbon are isoelectronic with respect to the valence shell, and diamond has analogous 
polytypes, with the best known being 3C, which corresponds to cubic diamond, and 2H, which 
corresponds to lonsdaleite. Other diamond polytypes 4H, 8H, 9R to 21R (R for rhombohedral) have 
been identified with calculated Xray diffraction data published by Ownby et al. in 1992 2.
