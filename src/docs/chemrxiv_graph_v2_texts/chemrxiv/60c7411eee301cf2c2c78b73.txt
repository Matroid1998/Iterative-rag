Description:
Units used in the synthesis of macrocycles to reduce strain energy.

Text:
nCPPs can also be viewed as the smallest crosssection of an armchair
singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and have thus a potential use as building
blocks for the bottomup synthesis of well dened SWCNT with specic edges and size. The synthesis of CPPs has been experimentally challenging due to the strain en
ergy needed to close the ring.7 Vogtle et al.8,9 attempted to synthesize CPPs from
macrocycles formed by arene and cyclohexane units to therefore reduce the strain
energy of the system. However, the rst synthesis of CPPs was aorded only by Jasti
et al.10 in 2008, followed by the rst selective synthesis of CPPs by Itami et al.11,12
using a modular approach to build nCPPs with n12.
