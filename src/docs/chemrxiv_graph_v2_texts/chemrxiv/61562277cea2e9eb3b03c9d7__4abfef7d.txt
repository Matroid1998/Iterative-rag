Description:
Forms equatorial positions with donor atoms from organic ligands, leading to clusters, 1D chains, or 2D layers.

Currently, uranium compounds are being studied more closely due to their potentiality in 
benefiting environmental safety in maximizing the utilization of limited sources.24 
Upon studying uranium, the uranium framework contains linear structure ions and donor 
ions, through this characteristic one can confirm the donor atoms from the organic ligands will 
display uranyl equatorial positions which give rise to clusters, 1D chains, or 20 layers.510 The 
challenge with this element stems from the element displaying different physical and chemical 
properties existing in four different oxidation states of 3, 4, 5, 6. The oxidation states of 3 
and 5 are very stable, leading this earth metal to exist in oxidation phase UO2, U3O8, and U3O11.
