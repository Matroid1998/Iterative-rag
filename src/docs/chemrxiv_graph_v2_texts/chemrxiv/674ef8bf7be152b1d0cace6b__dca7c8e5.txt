Description:
Used in existing membranes for helium upgrading.

Text:
MOFbased membranes have been developed and were tested for Heupgrading, but they significantly 
suffer from the large pore sizes, grain boundaries causing insufficient molecular sieving capabilities. Approaches have been made to combine ZIF8 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework 8) and fullerenes, with 
one of the best results for Heupgrading so far, reaching a selectivity (HeCH4)  9.2 with a permeance 
of 210 GPU at only 3.5 wt. loading of C70.15 Thus far, MOF materials could not show to be better 
than existing carbon membranes.16 Using MOFs in polymers for Heupgrading, such as HKUST1 
(Cu3BTC2 with BTC3 1,3,5Benzenetricarboxylate) in Matrimid  (a polyimide), has shown highly 
promising results.17 Loading Matrimide  membranes with 40 wt.
