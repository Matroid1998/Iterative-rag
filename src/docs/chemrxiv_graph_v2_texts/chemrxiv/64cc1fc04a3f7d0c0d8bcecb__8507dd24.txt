Description:
Forms layers in heterostructured quantum dots with band mismatch properties.

Text:
In quantum computing, the band mis
match between the SiGe and Si layers in heterostructured 
SiGeSi quantum dots is exploited to confine an addressable 
electron in a potential well.35 
As strained silicon nanoelectronics become increas
ingly miniaturized, now in the singlenanometer regime,6 an 
atomistic understanding of how Gedoping perturbs silicon 
becomes increasingly relevant. Meanwhile, quantum com
puting applications of SiGe heterostructures rely on the be
havior of single spins that are highly sensitive to local per
turbations in their surrounding structure. There is thus a 
broad yet mounting need to understand how Gedoping im
pacts the physical properties of silicon at an atomistic struc
tural level.
