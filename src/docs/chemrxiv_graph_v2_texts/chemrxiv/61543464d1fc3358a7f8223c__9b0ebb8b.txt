Description:
Used in high concentrations to disassemble polymeric carriers by oxidation.

Text:
in 2004 reported the first oxidationsensitive polymeric 
vesicles for drug delivery purposes, degradable in 10 h in presence of 10 vol H2O2.21 Since 
then, the same group have applied that principle in several organic nanoparticles including micelles 
and vesicles.2224 Their responsiveness is based on the oxidation of hydrophobic thioethers to 
more hydrophilic sulfoxides and sulfones. Oxidation leads to more watersoluble polymeric 
materials, and therefore, less stable micelles, allowing for the release of the incorporated cargo.25 
In most of these examples, exceedingly high concentrations of H2O2 (2.010 vol) are required to 
disassemble the carrier within hours.
