Description:
Extending reactivity to unactivated alkyl boronates in PBM reactions has been a challenge.

Text:
Among these, the threecomponent PBM reaction, first reported 
in 1993 19, has been an attractive method for medicinal chemists due to its ability to use widely 
available building blocks including amines, aldehydes, and aromatic boronic acids to rapidly 
access diverse C(sp2)rich chemical space17. However, PBM reaction remained underutilized 
because the substrate scope has been mainly restricted to activated aldehydes with adjacent 
heteroatoms as directing groups and aryl or alkenyl boronic acids. As most reactions of this class 
are mediated by a 2e mechanism where alkyl migration is unlikely to happen20, extending this 
reactivity to unactivated alkyl boronates, to escaping from the flatland 3, has been a challenge.

Description:
Coupling partners used in PBM reactions through radical addition processes.

Text:
A strategy that combines the diversity of a general PBM reaction with alkyl boronic coupling 
partners exponentially increases the accessibility of C(sp3)rich alkyl amines (Figure 1C, mnp 
hypothetical products in a 3D library). Such a method would enable holistic structural diversity 
coverage for complex aliphatic amines that could facilitate the comprehensive SAR probing and 
the development of drug candidates13. Despite some recent advance of PBM reaction with alkyl 
boronates have been achieved through radical addition process, where stabilized imine 
intermediate is often required11, a more general alkyl Petasis boronMannich (APBM) reaction is 
highly desirable.
