Description:
The precision of a PIPs PES for rMD17 ethanol was shown to be as good as the best performing ML methods and to be substantially faster than all the ML methods considered.

Machinelearned potentials (MLPs) oer the promise of providing rstprinciple approaches
for the fullspan of molecular dynamics simulations.1 Among the panoply of machinelearned
methods,2 permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs)35 have been used for nearly 20
years to develop precise, highdimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules,69
clusters,1012 manybody terms for water potentials,1316 and atomcentered manybody
representations for materials17 and molecular force elds.18 The precision of a PIPs PES
for rMD17 ethanol was shown to be as good as the best performing ML methods and to
be substantially faster (factors of 10 or more)19 than all the ML methods considered, i.e.,
GAPSOAP,20 ANI,21 DPMD,22 sGDML,23,24 PhysNet,25 KREG,26 and pKREG.27 Similar
factors in speed dierences and high precision for PIPs were recently reported for 21atom
