Description:
Present in trace amounts as a byproduct of benzyl alcohol oxidation.

Text:
Conventionally, this oxidation is carried out using stoichiometric oxygen donors like
chromates or permanganates. These oxidizing agents also yield significant amounts of by
products and toxic products.7,8 Numerous experimental studies have been done over the past
two decades focused on developing catalysts to overcome these drawbacks. Aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol produces benzaldehyde in highest yield and tolene as
the major product with traces of benzoic acid, dibenzyl ether and benzyl benzoate.9 Metal
