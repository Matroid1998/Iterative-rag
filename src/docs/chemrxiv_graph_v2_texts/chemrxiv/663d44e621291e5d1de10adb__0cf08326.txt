Description:
Less reactive alternatives to aryl triflates and nonaflates.

Text:
Couplings with aryl 
triflates and nonaflates are especially common, notwith
standing the alternative, albeit less reactive, mesylates and 
tosylates.1115 And while they have some inherent disad
vantages (such as instability, environmental toxicity, cost 
of preparation, and poor atom economy in the making of 
triflates),16 they are taken for granted as the two main op
tions available for use in synthetic organic chemistry.17 
Unfortunately, as both contain C(sp3)F bonds, they are 
technically polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs),18 
reagents that only recently have been flagged for their en
vironmental impact.
