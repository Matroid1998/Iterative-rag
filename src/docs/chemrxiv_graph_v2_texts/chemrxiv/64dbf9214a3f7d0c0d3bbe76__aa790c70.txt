Description:
Constructed via a Heck reaction in the synthesis of spiroindimicins.

In continuation of our 
interest in this family, we aimed to develop a 
concise route to the more prevalent 55
spirocyclic 
members 
(i.e., 
24, 
68), 
representing the remainder of the class. To date, two total syntheses of the 55spirocyclic spiroindimicins have been reported (Scheme 
1A).4 The first, by Sperry and Blair in 2015, provides access to racemic spiroindimicins B (2) and C (3) in 
1516 steps from commercial materials via earlystage construction of the spiroindoline via a Heck 
reaction, followed by installation of the remaining indole and pyrrole rings via Fisher indolization and 
SchllkopfMagnusBartonZard (SMBZ) reaction, respectively.5a Very recently, Xu et al.
