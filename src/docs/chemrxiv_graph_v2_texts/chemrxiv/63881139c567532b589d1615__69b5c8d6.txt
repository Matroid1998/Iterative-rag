Description:
Dimers exhibit offset stacking with parallel-displaced aromatic rings.

Text:
The benzene dimer has long been studied by quantum
chemists as an example of a  stacking interaction,111
although its archetypal status in that regard has been
questioned,10 because complexes of larger polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, starting already with naphtha
lene dimer, demonstrate a much stronger preference for
cofacial stacking as compared to the Tshaped or
CH    geometry that is similar in energy in the case of
(benzene)2 but much less stable for larger acene dimers.10
All of the acene dimers exhibit oset stacking, in which
the centertocenter coordinate of the aromatic rings is
paralleldisplaced, e.g., by 1.8 A in the case of benzene
dimer.

Description:
Larger dimers exhibit slipstacked geometries influenced by dispersion and Pauli repulsion.

Text:
Although long attributed to a competition be
tween dispersion interactions and quadrupolar electro
statics, the origin slipstacked  geometries (in ben
zene dimer, larger acene dimers, and in benzene on the
surface of graphene) has more recently been shown to
arise from a competition between dispersion and Pauli
repulsion, with electrostatics playing a negligible role in
driving oset stacking.912 (In larger acene dimers, elec
trostatics does play an important role in stabilizing cofa
cial geometries relative to Tshaped orientations.10)
The aim of the present work is to examine whether
these same conclusions hold for macrocycles that assem
ble into porous frameworks in the solid state. For ex
ample, the 18annulene molecule (Fig.
