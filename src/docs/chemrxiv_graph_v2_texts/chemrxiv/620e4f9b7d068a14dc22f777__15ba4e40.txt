Description:
A functional group inserted into unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds by hydroxylases.

Text:
2OGdependent nonheme iron enzymes (NHFe) catalyze a diverse range of reactions ranging 
from epoxidation to stereoinversion.1 From natural product biosynthesis to cellular signaling 
and metabolism, the reactions catalyzed by this superfamily of enzymes serve crucial roles 
biologically.2,3 Two subgroups of this superfamily are the hydroxylases and halogenases. Hydroxylases catalyze the insertion of a hydroxyl functional group into unactivated aliphatic C
H bonds while halogenases catalyze the insertion of a chloridebromide functionality into such 
bonds. The difference in reactivity of the two enzymes is enabled by differences in their iron
binding primary coordination sphere.
