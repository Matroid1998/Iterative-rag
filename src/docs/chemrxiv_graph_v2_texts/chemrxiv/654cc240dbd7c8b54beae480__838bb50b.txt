Description:
A common structure type in polyoxometalate chemistry often associated with Anderson or Anderson-Evans wheels.

Amongst these, Ni4 SMMs have proven to be a particularly fruitful source of information on exchange 
bias effects,6 antisymmetric exchange,7 quantum tunnelling,8 transverse anisotropy,9 and Berry Phase 
interference.10 Other common structural motifs demonstrating fascinating magnetic properties include 
wheels11 and discs.12 The latter offer interest from a variety of perspectives, including as molecular 
analogues of 2D lattices,13 model complexes to examine spin frustration14 and as robust platforms to 
quantitatively analyse magnetostructural correlations.15 
Planar heptanuclear discs conforming to centred hexagons are often referred to as Anderson or 
AndersonEvans wheels,16 and are a common structure type in both polyoxometalate chemistry17 and 
clusters of paramagnetic 3d ions.18 A search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) reveals that 
there are twenty nine NiII7 Anderson wheels.1938 Of these, fifteen have had their magnetic behaviour 
reported, but only five have been subject to quantitative analysis.21,26,30,36,37 This is perhaps not 
surprising.
