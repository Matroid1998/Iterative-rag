Description:
A semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide with a direct band gap.

The successful isolation of graphene from graphite along with the
discovery of its distinctive properties has attracted considerable inter
est in 2Dlayered materials 1. In recent years, remarkable progress
has been made in the exploration of these materials, evolving from fun
damental research to advanced materials engineering and the develop
ment of innovative technologies 25. A special place among 2D
layered materials belongs to semiconducting transitionmetal dichalco
genides (TMDs) containing molybdenum (Mo) such as MoS2, MoSe2,
and MoTe2 with the general formula MoX2, where X refers to a chalco
gen element. MoX2 monolayers possess a direct band gap in contrast
to graphene and offer unique physicochemical characteristics, paving
the way for their application in (opto)electronics, spintronics, electro
catalysis, sensing, and energy storage 415.

Description:
Shares structural, bonding, and surface interaction similarities with MoS2 and MoSe2.

These electrocatalytic processes include,
most notably, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), along with re
duction reactions of carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxy
gen (ORR) 3542. In terms of catalyst performance, the sheets of
MoX2 are generally regarded comparable owning apparent structural
and chemical similarities. Consequently, among these, 2D MoS2 has
garnered particular attention as an electrocatalyst, largely due to its
greater availability compared to other TMDs 4244. However, while
this perspective holds to some extent, it is incomplete and reflects a
common misconception about the physicochemical properties of MoX2
sheets. This misconception arises from the many wellknown similarities
shared by MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2. These materials have a common
structure, bonding configuration, and general surface interaction mech
anism 1627.
