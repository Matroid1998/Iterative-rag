Description:
A compound involved in oxidation and successive amination reactions to produce nonnatural aromatic amino acids.

Text:
It has the advantage of concentrating all the reagents 
and catalysts in one and the same reaction medium, which 
limits 
energy 
consumption, 
eliminates 
intermediate 
purification, and therefore the cost in atoms, and makes it 
possible to carry out the synthesis of compounds that were 
previously difficult to access.24,2528 In particular, several 
studies have already demonstrated the interest of coupling gold 
nanoparticles with different families of enzymes for the 
construction of innovative reaction cascades, in particular in 
order to introduce chirality into new building blocks.2933 
We have recently exemplified the capacity of hybrid catalysis 
through the production of a new nonnatural aromatic amino 
acid, resulting from the oxidation and successive amination of 
5hydroxymethylfurfural 
(HMF) 
the 
5aminomethyl2
