Description:
A complex formed by the transfer of a Ph ion from BPh4 to Cu, where the Ph ion bridges two copper centers.

One of the main problems in the mechanistic 
analysis of boroncopper transmetalation lies in the high complexity 
of the obtained reaction mixtures.5 Furthermore, the resulting or
ganocopper species are highly reactive. Hence, only very few rele
vant intermediates have been identified, such as the Cu2(11
Ph)DPFN(BPh4) complex (Scheme 1a) formed by the transfer of 
a Ph ion from BPh4 to Cu.6 Xray analysis showed that in this com
plex, the Ph ion bridges the two copper centers. In contrast, the neu
tral 
innersphere 
ion 
pair 
(2,2bipyridine)Cu(BPh4) 
(Scheme 1b), an active precatalyst in the cyclopropanation of al
kenes,7 does not spontaneously undergo BCu transmetalation. Scheme 1. Structurally Characterized Complexes Relevant in the 
Context of BoronCopper Transmetalation.
