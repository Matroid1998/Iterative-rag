Description:
Reduced by excited uranyl species to form radicalized substrate species and peroxide ions.

Text:
The photoreactivity of uranium, and specifically that of the uranyl unit (UO22), has been a 
fruitful area of study for actinide chemists for decades. From the characteristic luminescent 
emission of the uranyl cation to the chemical reactivity afforded by the excited species, researchers 
have probed ways to harness this unique photoreactivity. Some of our previous work has 
capitalized on the ability of the uranyl cation to prompt in situ peroxide formation in order to make 
novel families of solidstate complexes.1 Indeed this is a wellunderstood phenomenon whereby 
the uranyl cation is excited by incident light to make a strongly oxidizing species that participates 
in hydrogen abstraction (with a suitable substrate) and subsequently reduces ambient oxygen,2 
ultimately resulting in radicalized substrate species and peroxide ions.
