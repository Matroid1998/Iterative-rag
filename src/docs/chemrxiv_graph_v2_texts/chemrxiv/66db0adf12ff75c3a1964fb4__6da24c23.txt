UiO66 possesses a 3D structure. Its synthesis in 2D morphology has not been reported mainly because of the challenges from the 
isotropic robust bonds in its structure. While an emerging class of nonvan der Waals (nonvdW) quasi2D materials has been syn
thesized from nonlayered 3D crystals,3033 they have been predominantly demonstrated for transition metal oxides. Extending this 
concept to MOFs, and in particular UiO66, is highly attractive to prepare 2D morphologies and ultrathin films for advancing thin 
film applications for highly stable MOFs. A potential approach is anisotropic 2D growth of UiO66, however, this has not been 
reported.
