Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases that most contribute to global warming1,2. During the last decades,
20
its concentration in Earths atmosphere has substantially increased, resulting in a temperature rise of approximately 1C3,4. 21
Models presented in the 2021 IPCC report suggest that if the climate policies are kept the same, the average temperature
22
is predicted to increase by 2.5 to 2.9C by 2100, causing deleterious effects on living beings2,5. In 2021, fossil fuels
23
(including oil, natural gas, and coal) accounted for 77 of global energy consumption. Moreover, between 2020 and
24
2021, there was a staggering 17 increase in fossil fuel consumption6.
