Description:
Comprise more than 40% of the earth's crust and serve as primary sources for several industries.

Silicon, found mostly as silica (SiO2) or silicates (e. g. Si2O3
2) 
comprising more than 40 of the earths crust serve as primary 
sources for several multibillion dollar industries including the 
silicone polymers, photovoltaics, and the electronics (semicon
ductors). The use of SiO2 as a chemical raw material has relied, 
to date, exclusively on the equipment, capital and energy
intensive carbothermal reduction of quartz carried out at 1900 
 C in arc furnaces affording metallurgical grade silicon (SiMG, ca. 98  purity) 1. The process requires around 1011 kWh to 
produce one kilogram of SiMG 2, with electricity accounting for 
40 of the total production cost 3.
