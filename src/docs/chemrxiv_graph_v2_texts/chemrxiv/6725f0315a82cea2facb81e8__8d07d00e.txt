Description:
A ligand variant in metallocene complexes.

One of 
these is more prone to form the heterodinuclear, outersphere 
ionpair (OSIP 3), which is the dominant species present at high 
AlZr ratios.5 It is known that OSIP 3 and its polymeric analogues 
are resting states in hexene polymerization using this catalyst.6 
More recently, the activation of metallocene complexes L2ZrX2 
L2  Cp2, nBuCp2, rac(CH2)2Ind2 (racEBI), X  Cl or Me by MAO 
using the technique of ESIMS in fluorobenzene solvent has 
been studied.7 This technique, which selectively detects the 
cations and anions corresponding to OSIP 3, complements 
earlier spectroscopic studies in that activation of ansa
metallocene complexes by MAO is uncomplicated by formation 
of homodinuclear (L2ZrMe)2X (X  Me, Cl) complexes.8 
Unfortunately, ESIMS does not provide information about CIP, 
as the L2ZrMe cation is only indirectly detected through gas 
phase, collision induced dissociation of the L2ZrMe2AlMe2 
cation.9 
However, ESIMS does provide the mz ratio of the counter
anions that are present.
