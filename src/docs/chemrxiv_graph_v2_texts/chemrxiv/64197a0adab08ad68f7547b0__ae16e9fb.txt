Description:
Electron deficient compounds used in allylic substitution reactions.

To realize this, we developed a new molecular approach for signal amplification in 
aqueous buffer by using allylic substitution of electron deficient allyl acetates with trivalent 
phosphines as signal amplifiers. This amplifier contains an inactive phosphorous moiety and 
an electrophilic double bond, which enables nucleophiletriggered substitution, converting the 
amplifier into a neutral phosphine species. This strategy enables (i) control over disulfide 
redox chemistry by using the signal responsive allylic phosphonium ion, capable of direct thiol
analyte recognition and corresponding release of a phosphine species; (ii) coupling of this 
chemistry to a macroscopic response of a crosslinked hydrogel. Upon signal detection, the 
gels undergo physical degradation through chemical cascade reactions within the gel matrix.
