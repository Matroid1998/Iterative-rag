Description:
Serve as bioisosteric replacements in medicinal research to improve physicochemical properties.

Small 
aliphatic 
rings, 
such 
as 
cyclopropanes, 
cyclobutanes, 
azetidine 
and 
bicyclo1.1.0pentanes, serve a pivotal role as bioisosteric replacements in medicinal 
research. 1 Incorporating them into drug candidates often leads to improved 
physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity, solubility, and metabolic stability, offering 
significant advantages in drug design and development (Fig. 1a ). 2 Therefore, developing 
practical methods for synthesizing such rings or incorporating them into complex molecules, 
particularly biologically active natural products or drug candidates, has become a critical 
area of research. The functionalization of strained rings, such as bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs), 
housanes, tricyclo1.1.1.01,3pentanes (TCPs), and azabicyclo1.1.0butanes (ABBs), through 
the cleavage the bridging bond has emerged as a privileged strategy due to their high 
reactivity arising from inherent ring strain and diverse reaction modes.
