Description:
Compounds used in switchable solvents with potential applications in desalination, water softening, antisolvent precipitation, and oil extraction.

Text:
For example, in living 
cells, some organelles do not have membranes and appear to be unbound regions of liquid that sustain 
different composition and properties to their surroundings.1 In the chemical industry, biphasic liquids have 
been used to perform separations for decades.2,3 Recently, switchable biphasic mixtures have come into 
focus as an emerging separation method, where the application and removal of a stimulus (e.g., tempera
ture, pH, pressure, light, or CO2) triggers a drastic change in material properties, such as mutual solubility 
of two liquids.4 For example, aminebased switchable solvents have shown potential for desalination,59

Aminewater systems are notable for their unusual lower critical solution temperature (LCST; also known 
as lower consolute solution temperature) behavior amines are miscible with water at low temperature, 
combining into a single phase, but separate into two phases at high temperature (for example, see in Figure
