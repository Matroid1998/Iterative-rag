Description:
Materials created by carbonisation of polymers using CO2 laser processing.

Text:
CO2 laser processing has also 
been used to directly make electrodes by carbonisation of polymers to create laserinduced graphene (LIG) materials, either freestanding 
or on a backing material, like ITO and this offers a possible advancement towards reducing the high cost of exploiting the laser 
technology for sensing applications26,27.
