Description:
A solvent-exposed amino acid commonly used for site-selective chemical modification.

Siteselective chemical modification remains a crucial 
challenge in the development of proteinbased technol
ogies and tools. Chemoselective approaches to 
achieve singlesite labelling typically rely on the intro
duction of a uniquely reactive amino acid, most com
monly a solventexposed cysteine or an unnatural re
active handle via codon reassignment.1,2 Though these 
methods are powerful, they are limited by the require
ment for prior genetic engineering of the target protein, 
and are therefore poorly suited to proteins isolated 
from natural sources, or of eukaryotic origin where re
combinant expression may be challenging.
