Description:
A compound studied for ultrafast molecular dynamics using UV pump probe and ionization techniques.

Text:
The choice of especially rst row transition metal carbonyls for these studies
30
is motivated by their relative simplicity in terms of electronic structure and chemistry, due to
31
the small number of electrons and limited relativistic eects. Of these systems, ironpentacar
32
bonyl Fe(CO)5 has been one of the most thoroughly investigated systems 7, in particular
33
the processes initiated by photoinduced metaltoligand charge transfer (MLCT). This in
34
cludes attempts to study the ultrafast molecular dynamics (MD) using UV pump probe and
35
ionization techniques 2, 8. Trushin and coworkers established, in their femtosecond dynam
36
ics study, the sequential dissociation of carbonmonoxide (CO) from Fe(CO)5 into Fe(CO)4
37
and subsequently Fe(CO)3, with the rst step happening within 100 fs 8.
