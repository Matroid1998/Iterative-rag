Description:
A motif that has not yet been addressed in synthetic solutions.

Text:
While the Cook group has developed an approach to the less common C19 methylbearing sarpagines,16 
synthetic solutions to the alkyl chloride or cyclopropane motifs have not been reported to date. One preliminary study by 
the Lei group explicitly targets the rauvomine alkaloids.27 While these authors are able to access the core sarpagan scaffold 
using established PictetSpengler (9  10) and Dieckmann (10  11) disconnections popularized by Cook, neither the C
19 stereocenter nor the cyclopropane or chloro motifs have yet been addressed.
