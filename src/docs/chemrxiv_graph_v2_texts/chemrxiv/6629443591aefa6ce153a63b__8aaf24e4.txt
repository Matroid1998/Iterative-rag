Description:
A semiconductor used in dye-sensitized solar cells where charge recombination occurs at the dye-TiO2 interface.

Upon light excita
tion, the surfaceadsorbed dye molecules inject electrons 
into the semiconductor conduction band and the reduced 
form is regenerated by accepting electrons from water ox
idation catalysts via intramolecular hole hopping.6,7 In the 
initial examples of this concept, open circuit voltages close 
to 1.0 V were achieved, but the incident photontocurrent 
efficiency (IPCE) for water splitting was only 13.812 
Mechanistic studies attributed the low efficiency to the slow 
kinetics of water oxidation catalysis relative to charge re
combination at the dyeTiO2 interface.8,1315 Coreshell 
electrode structures,16 TiO2 nanowire architectures,17 fast 
molecular water oxidation catalysts,18 and bilayer sensi
tizercatalyst films19 were subsequently developed, result
ing in visible light IPCEs for water splitting in the range of 
15.
