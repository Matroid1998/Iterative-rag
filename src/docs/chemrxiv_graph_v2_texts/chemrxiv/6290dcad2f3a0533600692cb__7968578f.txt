Description:
Cyclic Ni(O2) was identified in an Ar matrix.

Text:
There are relatively few experimental studies concerning the structure812 and reactivity of 
NiO20.1316 Neutral NiO2 was first studied in ideal gas matrices, where three isomers were 
identified in an Ar matrix9 cyclic Ni(O2), bent NiOO, and linear ONiO (referred to as NiO2 
hereafter). Subsequent work in Ne matrices found preferential formation of NiO2 with trace 
Ni(O2), allowing for the extraction of two and three vibrational frequencies for these species, 
respectively.12 In the gas phase, anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) has been used to probe 
the geometric and electronic structure of these species.

Description:
Has an electron affinity of 0.82(3) eV, which is considerably lower than that of NiO2.

The first PES study of NiO2 was 
performed by Wu and coworkers,10 who observed photodetachment from both the bent Ni(O2) 
and linear NiO2 anions, finding the electron affinity (EA) of Ni(O2) to be 0.82(3) eV, 
considerably lower than that of NiO2 at 3.05(1) eV. The NiO2 band showed partially resolved 
vibrational structure with a frequency of 750 cm1. This work also found transitions to two low
lying electronic states of NiO2 with term energies of 0.40(2) and 0.77(3) eV. Subsequent anion 
PES work performed by Ramond et al.11 reexamined the ground state spectrum of NiO2 with 
improved resolution, yielding a refined EA of 3.043(5) eV as well as the v1 symmetric stretch 
frequency of 745(30) cm1 from a progression in this mode.
