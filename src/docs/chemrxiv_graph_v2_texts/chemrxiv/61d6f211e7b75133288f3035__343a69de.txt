Description:
Coordinates with T3 and T2 copper ions in the TNC.

Text:
The TNC contains a triangle of closely located copper 
ions including a pair of T3 copper ions coordinated by three histidine residues each and one T2 
copper ion coordinated by two histidine residues. Electrons are accepted from substrate at the T1 
copper site. Via an electrontransfer chain the electrons are transferred to the TNC where 
molecular oxygen reduction reaction O2  4e  4H  2H2O occurs (Solomon et al., 1996; 
Jones and Solomon, 2015). The TNC is connected to surrounding solvent via the T3 and T2 
channels clearly observed in structures as chains of water molecules (Fig 1 in Polyakov et al., 
2017). Molecular oxygen gets to the TNC through the T3 channel.
