Description:
Typically used as a noninert support for Pt in catalytic materials, affecting electronic structure and chemical properties.

Text:
Nanostructured materials based on ceria (CeO2) and Pt have a wide range of 
applications in catalysis, such as in the threeway conversion in automobile exhausts,1 in 
anode2 or cathode3 materials of fuel cells, or for mediating the water gas shift reaction,4 
among others.5 CeO2 is typically used in such materials as a noninert support for the 
more active Pt phase, leading to intricate metalsupport interactions that affect the 
electronic structure and chemical properties of both the metal and the oxide.4,68 These 
electronic metalsupport interactions further complicate the already challenging task of 
characterizing the properties of nanostructured catalytic materials, which are typically 
structurally complex.
