There are several types of solid electrolytes (SE) that can work as a medium for ionic (lithium ion) 
diffusion and as separators in SSBs. These types can be categorized into polymers, oxides, sulfides, 
hydrides, halides, borates, and thin films.2 SSBs are not sufficiently mature and still under 
development. Composite electrodes made of blends of active material (AM) and SE particles give the 
promise of SSBs with high energy density. Still, there are many issues to overcome. One issue is the 
limited contact surface area between AM and SE particles, which blocks the lithium ions from reaching 
the AM through SE. Another one is the short ionic and electronic percolation pathways within the
