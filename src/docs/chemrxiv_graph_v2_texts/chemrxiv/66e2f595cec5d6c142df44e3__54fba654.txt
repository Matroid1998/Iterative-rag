Description:
A metal oxide used in heterogeneous catalysis with tunable structural, electronic, magnetic, and redox properties.

Text:
The interest towards the use of metal oxides in
heterogeneous catalysis has substantially increased these
recent years, due to their lower cost compared to metals. Co3O4 particularly has captured interest as it was
found to perform remarkably in many reactions17. To
improve the properties of Co3O4 based catalysts, tune
their activity and therefore rationalize the production
of chemicals, the ability to manipulate the structural,
electronic, magnetic and redox properties has been a
subject of prime importance. Defect engineering has
been widely used to tune the structureativity ratio via
the formation of imperfections such like line and points
defects.

activity of the nanosheets. Similarly, the substitution
of Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu and Ni into octahedral sites and
the impact on the selective oxidation of 2propanol on
mesoporous Co3O4 was investigated by Falk et al.13 The
systematic study revealed the detrimental and beneficial
contributions to the catalytic activities of Cr, Mn, Fe
and Cu, Ni, respectively.
