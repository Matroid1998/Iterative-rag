Description:
Molecules that experience greater IR frequency shifts and larger fields when nitrogen is included.

Text:
By employing vibrational Stark and infra
red (IR) spectroscopies and molecular dynamics (MD) simula
tions, we show that, of all the carbonylcontaining molecules stud
ied, greater IR frequency shifts and larger fields are directed on 
carbonyls when nitrogen is included at one or both positions. The 
fields projected on these amide carbonyls are much larger due to 
the enhanced electron delocalization arising from the p
