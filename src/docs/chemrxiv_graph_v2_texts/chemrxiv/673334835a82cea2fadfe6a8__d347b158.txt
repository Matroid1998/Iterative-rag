Description:
A compound with a notable difference in HOMO-LUMO energy gap due to nitrogen positioning.

Text:
Thiophenes and azaacenes, in particular, have
been the subject of extensive research due to their remarkable potential in organic electronic
devices for their transformative impact on the performance and functionality of these
materials.811 Derivatives of indole and its isomers, isoindole and indolizine are among the
less studied PACs for organic optoelectronics (Figure 1). A recent theoretical investigation by
PinoRios and Sol has cast these molecules in a new light, revealing significant insights into
their relative stability.12 Their research uncovered a pronounced disparity in the distribution of
local aromaticity within these structures, which is influenced by the positioning of the nitrogen
atom. The difference in the HOMOLUMO energy gap between indole and indolizine of 0.88
eV is attributed solely to the variations in nitrogen position within their frameworks.

Description:
A compound that has been the subject of considerable study.

Text:
While expanded derivatives of indole have been the subject of
considerable study,1416 the integration of indolizines into polycyclic aromatic frameworks
remains surprisingly sparse.17,18 In this context, we have embarked on a quest to merge
