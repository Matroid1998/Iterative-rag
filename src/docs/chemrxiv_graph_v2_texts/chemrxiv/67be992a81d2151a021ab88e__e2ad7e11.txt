Description:
A material used in the deposition on Si structure and for creating silicide.

Text:
The usual BC step consists of four parts 1) 
Deposition of polysilicon on Si structure and 2) Deposition 
of Ti on polysilicon 3) Anneal to form silicide (TiSix) at the 
interface 4) Metal deposition, which connects the contact to 
the digit line. Prior technology nodes used a thick 
Polysilicon as the silicon material for creating the silicide 
and forming the contact 1,2. This Polysilicon occupied 
majority of the contact structure and region. In metal bit 
contact (MBC), the majority of the contact structure is made 
of metal (step 4), instead of traditional polysilicon (step 1) 
structure, which helps lower the overall resistance of the 
contact. This change from majoritypoly to majoritymetal 
is highly disruptive but is necessary to enable low resistance 
contacts at very small dimensions.

Description:
Used in thin deposition layers to enable highly doped junctions with silicide.

Text:
Therefore, in MBC, the 
amount of polysilicon deposition is thinner, mostly to 
enable a highly doped junction with silicide. Fig I Metal bit contact (MBC) showing a poly void post 1050C spike anneal
