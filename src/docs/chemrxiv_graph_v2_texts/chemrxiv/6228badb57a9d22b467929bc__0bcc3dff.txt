Description:
Cations formed by the one or two-electron oxidation of amines during AC electrolysis.

Despite these exciting findings, 
the mechanisms behind the controlled oxidation or reduc
tion of substrates during AC electrolysis remain unclear. Due to the lack of mechanistic understanding, one must go 
through a timeconsuming reiterative trialanderror pro
cess to discover the optimal AC electrolysis conditions. Here, we report a mechanism by which AC electrolysis 
controls the one or twoelectron oxidation of amines to 
amino radicals or iminium cations, enabling selective 
amine functionalization by simply adjusting the AC fre
quency. In this mechanism, the degree of amine oxidation is 
controlled by managing the redox environment where the 
amino radical cation III is deprotonated to amino radical IV, 
utilizing the alternating redox environment of AC electroly
sis.
