Description:
A conducting polymer known for its chemical and environmental stability, redox reversibility, and ease of synthesis.

Text:
Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most widely studied conducting polymers due to its 
many interesting properties like chemical and environmental stability, redox reversibility, and 
ease of synthesis 1. The conducting or semiconducting nature of PANI has been used in various 
applications, like biosensors 2,3, supercapacitors 4, metalsemiconductor devices 5, 
actuators 6, secondary batteries 7,8, light emitting diodes 9, photovoltaic devices 10, field 
effect transistors 11, laser printing 12, anticorrosion coating 1315, etc. However, the main 
drawback of PANI is its poor solubility in water 16. Till date, the most common method to 
improve the solubility, and hence processability of PANI in water is sulfonation, in which the 
emeraldine salt form of PANI is treated with chlorosulfonic acid in an inert solvent 1721.
