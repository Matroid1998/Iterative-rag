Description:
Proteiongenic amino acid residues involved in structure-altering oxidative cyclization events.

The modification of bioactive linear 
peptides by cyclization has been shown to be an effective 
strategy for addressing this problem.510 In fact, the bio
activity and pharmacokinetic profiles of constrained cy
clic peptides are often improved relative to their acyclic 
counterparts.11 
 Among Natures wide range of peptide cyclization 
strategies, the oxidative coupling of aromatic amino acid 
sidechains has drawn considerable interest. Proteino
genic tyrosine (Tyr) residues are often involved in struc
turealtering oxidative cyclization events via the genera
tion of tyrosyl radicals and related intermediates.12,13 
Such redox active intermediates are notably involved in 
the formation dityrosine and isodityrosine protein cross
links (Figure 1A).
