Description:
A strong base that increases the pH of solutions to mildly basic levels.

As examples of this challenge, the following wellknown pHinduced phenomena can 
be considered Pressuredriven electroosmosis through hexagonal boron nitride 
nanocapillaries15, carbon nanotubes16, graphene oxide membrane conductance17, and 
streaming currents through MoS2 pores18, all of which have vastly different surface chemistries 
in aqueous solutions. All these diverse experiments display a remarkable increase in current 
(x 23) when the pH of the surrounding bulk solution is increased from neutral to mildly basic 
(1 mM NaOH, pH 11). Hydrophobic nanoparticles, droplets, and gas bubbles of different 
materials all display the same pHdependent change in electrophoretic mobility1925. Increasing 
the pH of the surrounding aqueous bulk phase to the same mildly basic value results also in 
a x 23 increase in droplet mobility under the influence of an external electrostatic field.
