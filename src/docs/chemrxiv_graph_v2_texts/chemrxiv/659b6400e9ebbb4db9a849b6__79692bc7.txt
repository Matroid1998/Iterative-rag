of metal ions could significantly impact the water 
absorption capacity of the hydrogel25, leading to limited Cu2 
loading (9.90 wt) and resulting in defects such as layered cracks 
in the subsequent sintered samples. Herein, we present a facile and robust strategy for the 
creation of complex and dense microarchitected copper with 
elevated conductivity and hardness (Figure 1a). The process 
involves the utilization of a waterbased photoresin containing ion
exchangeable monomers, enabling the sculpting of 3D hydrogel 
scaffolds via DLP. Subsequent immersion of these scaffolds in a 
CuSO4 solution results in a notable high loading of Cu2 ions 
(20.31 wt) achieved through ion exchange.
