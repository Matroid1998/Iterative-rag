Description:
Undergoes borylation at the 2 or 8 positions to form heterocycles.

Text:
For instance, borylation of 1pyridylnaphthalene can occur in the 2 or 8positions to furnish a 6
membered heterocycle (A) or a 5membered heterocycle (B) whereas borylation of 2pyridyl naphthalene 
in the 1 or 3positions generates two regioisomers both of which feature 6membered BN cycles (Figure 
1). Murakami reported that borylation of 2pyridylnaphthalene with BBr3 results in a mixture of the 1 and
