Description:
Can be photocatalytically reduced to form hydrogen peroxide.

The field of photocatalysis currently witnesses an increasing interest in the 
development of various selective chemical conversions beyond hydrogen production 
via water splitting, in particular due to the growing concerns regarding the economical 
viability of photo(electro)catalytic water splitting,1 and especially since the 
photocatalytic production of highvalue compounds from lowcost chemical feedstock 
holds promise for commercially viable applications on a more immediate time scale as 
compared to the photocatalytic production of hydrogen.2, 3 One of the most attractive 
compounds that can be photocatalytically obtained by a simple twoelectron reduction 
of dioxygen is hydrogen peroxide, a highly versatile and environmentally benign 
oxidizing agent used in a number of important industrial processes.
