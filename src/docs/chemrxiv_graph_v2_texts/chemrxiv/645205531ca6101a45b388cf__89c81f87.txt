Description:
A component in MOFs studied theoretically with varying metals and anions.

Many 
other systems incorporating metaloxo centers have since then been investigated for the oxidation 
of methane by computational means.3034 Also, our group recently investigated metaloxo species 
in MOFs for the activation of the CH bond by identifying structureactivity relationships in MOFs 
based on DFT calculations,35,36 screening a MOF database to identify promising MOF systems,37 
and investigating triazolate based MOFs with varying metals and anions theoretically.38,39
