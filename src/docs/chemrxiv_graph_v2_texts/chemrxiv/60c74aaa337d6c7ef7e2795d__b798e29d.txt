Description:
A 5 or 6-membered ring formed during the delivery of a palladium catalyst to a CH bond.

Nitrogenrich 
scaffolds are of particular importance in a wide range of chemistryrelated fields, so nitrogenlinked 
directing groups have been the focus of considerable attention.5 In 2005 Daugulis introduced the 8
aminoquinoline and picolinamide directing groups,5a and since then a number of nitrogenlinked 
directing groups for CH activation have been reported (Figure 1).5 Typically, these directing groups 
deliver the palladium catalyst to a nearby CH bond via the formation of a 5 or 6membered 
palladacycle, though transannular functionalisation reactions have been observed in some cases.5e
