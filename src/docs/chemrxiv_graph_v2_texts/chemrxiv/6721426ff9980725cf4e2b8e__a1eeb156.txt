Description:
An inorganic host matrix with low phonon energies used to reduce phonon-assisted nonradiative relaxation.

Text:
With their tunable optical properties and 
precise nanoscale size control, UCNPs have been used for applications such as biological 
imaging,1 nanothermometry,2 superresolution microscopy,3 lithography,4 optical computing,5 
and photodetection.6 

The most common way to achieve efficient UCL from lanthanide ions is to embed them in 
inorganic host matrices such as NaYF4 and K2Pb2Cl5, whose low phonon energies reduce phonon
assisted nonradiative relaxation.7,8 UCL efficiency can be further enhanced by growing an 
undoped, epitaxial shell made of the same material, allowing the active lanthanide ions to be

Description:
A host material for UCNPs with optimized chemistry for growing high-quality epitaxial shells.

Text:
However, while the chemistry for 
growing highquality epitaxial shells has been optimized for some UCNP host materials (e.g., 
NaYF4),9 the growth of epitaxial shells for other host materials (e.g., K2Pb2Cl5) can be more 
challenging and remains an active area of research. Nonepitaxial oxide shells have been grown 
around UCNPs, leading to increased thermal stability;10 however, their high phonon energies 
typically do not enhance UCL and may even reduce it.
