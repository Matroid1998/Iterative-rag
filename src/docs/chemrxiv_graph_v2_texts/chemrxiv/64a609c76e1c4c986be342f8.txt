Description:
Forms a neutral vacancy known as the F0 center in MgO crystal.

Text:
F centers can trap one or two electrons within the anion vacancy, resulting in
the formation of F and F0 centers respectively. The electrostatic stabilization effectively
retains these electrons within the vacancy due to the large Madelung constant of the ionic
crystal.4
In this study, we focus specifically on the neutral oxygen vacancy, the F0 center in the
bulk of MgO crystal, and aim to understand the optical transitions involved. The F0 center
in MgO has been extensively investigated.
