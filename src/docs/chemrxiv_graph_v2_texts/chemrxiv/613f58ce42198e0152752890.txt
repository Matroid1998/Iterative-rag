Description:
Forms covalent bonds and is less chemically resistant to nucleophilic attack than carbon-carbon bonds.

Text:
These motifs are connected via covalent bonds such as CO,14 
52 
CS15 and CC9 or are directly attached to redox cores.6, 7, 16, 17 It appears that redox cores bonded to water
53 
solubilizing groups via Cheteroatom bonds are susceptible to nucleophilic substitution reactions, resulting 
54 
in the detachment of watersolubilizing groups from redox cores.10, 18, 19 Because carboncarbon bonds are 
55 
more chemically resistant against nucleophilic attack than carbonheteroatom bonds such as CO (S, N), it 
56 
is desirable to incorporate carboncarbon bonds between redox centers and watersolubilizing ending
