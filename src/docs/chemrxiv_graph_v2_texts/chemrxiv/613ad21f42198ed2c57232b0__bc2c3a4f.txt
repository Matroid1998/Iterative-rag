Description:
A three-dimensional material that can be reduced to two-dimensional graphene.

The nding of reducing the dimension from three
dimensional (3D) graphite to twodimensional (2D)1
grap hene suggests the further possibilities of lowdimensional
materials. Since then, several 2D materials like hBN2, 3,
4, SiC5, phosphorene6, transitional metal dichalcogenides7,
8, MXenes9 have been studied theoretically and ex
perimentally. The 2D ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) monolayer is getting great attention due to its
intriguing physical and chemical properties 10, 2, 3. It
has been successfully synthesized by several experimental
techniques such as the ball milling method11, high
energy electron radiation12, chemicalsolutionderived
method13, sonication centrifugation method14, molecu
lar beam epitaxy method15. It is a lowcost, highly active,
and stable catalyst16. It shows excellent biomechanism,
useful in scanning probe microscopes in nanomedical
eld17.
