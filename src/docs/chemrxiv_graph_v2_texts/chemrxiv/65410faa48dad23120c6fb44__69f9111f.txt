Description:
Passivation at zigzag edges can induce halfmetallicity in ZGNRs.

Text:
showed that an external inplane electric field can break the spin degeneracy
of ZGNRs resulting in halfmetallic ZGNRs.31 Jaiswal et al. reported that fluorine passivation at zigzag edges can
induce halfmetallicity in ZGNRs.32
Afterward, various schemes have been proposed in order to modulate ZGNRs magnetic properties for different
device applications, such as chemical functionalizations and substitutions, and exploiting quantum interference (QI)
effects to control spinpolarized electron transmission.3342 SaraivaSouza et al. reported the observation of destructive
quantum interference (DQI) features in the electron transmission spectrum, by adding an imidazole donor group to
the polyacetylene chain connected with the ZGNR electrodes.43 The observed DQI features can be further controlled
by the application of gate voltage. Valli et al.
