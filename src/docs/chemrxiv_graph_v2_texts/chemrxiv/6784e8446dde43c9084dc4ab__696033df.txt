Description:
A light atom detectable in CO3 2- using advanced microscopy techniques.

Text:
Since 2010, theoretical studies using rstprinciples calculations based on density func
tional theory (DFT) and advanced imaging techniques, such as highresolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), have signicantly advanced understanding of vaterite crys
tal structures.7,8 Light atoms such as carbon and oxygen in CO3
2 can be detected using
annular brighteld and atomicresolution highangle annular dark eld (ADF) microscopy,
producing clear diraction images of microscopic regions. 7,9,10 Spectroscopic techniques, in
cluding Raman11 and 43Ca solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 12 have further
rened the understanding of vaterite structures. An excellent review summarized these nd
