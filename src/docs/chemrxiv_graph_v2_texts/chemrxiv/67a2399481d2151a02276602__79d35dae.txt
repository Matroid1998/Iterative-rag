Description:
A potential biosourced intermediate for obtaining succinic anhydride.

Text:
Cyclic anhydrides are useful molecules, used either as intermediates to platform 
chemicals,1 or as monomers for the production of polyesters.24 The current industrial 
production of cyclic anhydrides is based on the oxidation of fossil feedstock, as 
exemplified by succinic anhydride (SA), which is mainly derived from nbutane.5 
Alternatively, cyclic anhydrides can be obtained after the catalytic carbonylation of 
oxygenated substrates epoxides,6,7 lactones,811 and ,,12 ,,13,14 or 
,unsaturated acids.15 In particular, SA can be obtained from propiolactone (PL) or 
acrylic acid (AA), which have the potential to be biosourced through intermediates like 
glycerol, lactic acid, 3hydroxypropanoic acid (3HPA), or ethanol (Scheme 1).16 
Provided this carbonylation takes place with carbon monoxide produced by reduction 
of carbon dioxide or gasification of biomass,17,18 this would mark a step forward 
towards sourcing the carbon skeleton of SA from renewable feedstocks (i.e.
