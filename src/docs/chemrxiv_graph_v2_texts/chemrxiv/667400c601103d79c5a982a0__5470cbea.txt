Description:
Used as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.

The huge variety of possible chemical 
compositions within these materials enables to customize chemical properties for specific 
applications such as oxygen permeable membranes, cathode materials for intermediate 
temperature solid oxide fuel cells (BaxSr1xCo1yFeyO3) 12, solar cells 13, light emitting diodes 
(LED) 14, transistors 15, and as catalyst 16, to name only a few. Due to the high diversity within the perovskite structure type family, numerous different crystal 
structures have been reported, which are wellsummarized in the book from Tilley 17. The most 
wellknown perovskitetype structure ABX3 is cubic and crystalizes in the space group Pm3m 
with a lattice parameter  3.9 (SrTiO3 18)  4.5  19.
