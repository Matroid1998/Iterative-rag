Description:
A BCS Class II drug used in SLNs formulations.

For a given drug, there is a multitude of 
formulation variables to consider, including the types of excipients, drugexcipient ratios, 
surfactant concentrations, and various manufacturing parameters. As a result, predicting the 
formulation outcomes a priori becomes a challenge and numerous rounds of drug formulation 
studies are required before settling on a satisfactory formulation. Thus, a more efficient 
development strategy is needed to expedite formulation design. In the past decade, researchers have begun to address this issue by utilizing datadriven 
methodologies to design SLNNLCs formulations, with the design of experiment (DoE) approach 
being the central focus 1216. For example, Diwan et al. employed the principles of DoE to 
design cilnidipine (CND, a BCS Class II drug) loaded SLNs 12.
