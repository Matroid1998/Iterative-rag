Description:
A reactive species monitored using activity-based sensing probes.

Text:
This property is of particular interest to 
the imaging community because dyes suitable for in vivo ap
plications are often large, hydrophobic, and exhibit poor 
solubility.910 
Our group and others have contributed to the develop
ment of activitybased sensing (ABS) probes designed to 
monitor cancer biomarkers such as hypoxia,1114 reactive 
oxygen and nitrogen species,1521 enzymes,2229 and thiols30
31 via photoacoustic (PA) imaging.3233 This modality is best 
described as a lightin, sound out approach in which ab
sorbed light is converted to ultrasound via the PA effect.34
35 Because sound can readily propagate through tissue, it is 
possible to obtain high resolution images in deep regions of 
the body.
