Widely recognized for its contribution in contemporary drug development and production.

Text:
An outstanding contribution of the fluorine in contemporary drug 
development and production is widely recognized.1 Every year, 
dozens of new fluorinecontaining new chemical entities are 
approved, now representing more than 20 of the marketed 
drugs.27 Fluorine and fluorinecontaining fragments are typically 
incorporated into 
drug substances 
via 
direct 
fluorination 
methodologies810 or by application of the fluorinated building 
blocks (BBs) (Figure 1, A).11 Contrary to the fluorination, the latter 
approach 
benefits 
from 
versatility, 
expedience, 
and 
low 
susceptibility to the substrate variation.1214 
Cyclobutane, the second smallest and one of the most strained 
rings among cycloalkanes, has also received increased attention 
from medicinal chemistry community over the last decade.
