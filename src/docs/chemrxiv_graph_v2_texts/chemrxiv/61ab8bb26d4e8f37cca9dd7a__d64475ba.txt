Carbohydrates are crucial to a broad array of biological processes relevant to human health and 
wellbeing.1 Research in this area is complicated by the broad diversity of possible structures 2 and the 
heterogeneity of carbohydrates in biological systems.3 This understanding of the crucial role of carbohydrate 
building blocks has led to a surge in demand for enabling tools, answered by significant advances in mass 
spectrometry of complex mixtures4 and labeling approaches to image or detect carbohydrates expressed on cell 
surfaces.5 Various perspectives6 and funding agencies7 have recognized that the synthesis of complex 
carbohydrates is a limiting step for advancement in the glycosciences due to difficulties in controlling regio8 and 
diastereoselectivity9 as well as challenges in preparing the appropriately protected building blocks.10 
A recent focus of our lab is the development of efficient catalytic methods for glycosylation, using the 
combination of glycosyl fluorides as the glycosyl donor and silyl ethers as the glycosyl acceptor.11 Glycosyl 
fluorides are an important class of glycosyl donors12 for which a wide variety of acid activators have been
