Description:
Hydrophilic polymers that provide hydrophilicity to hydrogels.

Text:
For example, a high swelling ratio and fast swelling kinetics are 
needed for superabsorbent applications.5 On the other hand, 
biodegradability and biocompatibility are more important for 
drug delivery6 or tissue engineering applications. Hydrophilicity 
is a vital property of all hydrogels, with hydrophilicity generally 
provided by hydrophilic polymers, such PEG or polyacrylamides. Although there are numerous reports on different types of 
hydrogels, novel formulations that can outperform commercial 
products are still needed. New hydrogel formulations with 
superior properties may not be enough for commercialization, 
as the scalability of the hydrogel synthesis, availability and cost 
of the starting materials are also critical factors for industrial 
production. In this paper, we describe a facile method to 
fabricate a novel hydrogesl based on urazole starting from 
cheap and readily available precursors.
