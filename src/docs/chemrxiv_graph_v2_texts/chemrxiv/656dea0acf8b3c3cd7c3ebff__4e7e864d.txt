Description:
The main constituent of bones.

If one has to name the most important element of life as we know it, one would probably
not spontaneously think of phosphorus. Accounting for less than 1 of a human body mass,
i.e., much less than carbon or oxygen for example, the vast majority of it composes the
hydroxyapathite, the main constituent of bones. Each kilogram of tissue actually contains
less than a gram of phosphorus. Yet, it is an essential constituant of nucleic acids and lipids,
and it is involved in crucial regulatory modications of proteins. The equilibrium between
diphosphate and triphosphate is at the very core of the freeenergy storage and release in
most biological processes.
