Description:
Compounds that can be taken up into plant shoots for phytoextraction.

Text:
Plants can be used to degrade, 
64 
stabilize, extract, or volatilize contaminants from soil.13 Here, the goal is phytoextraction, where 
65 
PFAS are taken up into plant shoots that can subsequently be removed from the site. PFAS are 
66 
accumulated by a wide range of plant species, though there is some variability.10,14 Fiber hemp 
67 
was chosen for this study as it is an annual crop that grows quickly, takes up large amounts of 
68 
water, has limiting grazing by animal species, and does not shed substantial leaf matter back into 
69 
the soil.
