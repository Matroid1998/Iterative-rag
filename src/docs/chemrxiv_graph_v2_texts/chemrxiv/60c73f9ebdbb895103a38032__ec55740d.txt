 Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) available Description of force elds
and simulation details, hydration free energies, electrostatic potential in the vicin
ity of amino acid side chains, linear models to reproduce the calculated hydration
free energies, radial distribution functions, conformational changes in uorinated
side chains. AMBERformat force elds for mono and diuorinated amino acids
available upon request. bic effect involving uorinated amino acids? The answer is, sim
ply, that we do not. Here we focus on one factor contributing to
the hydrophobic effect solutewater interactions, for simplicity
referred to as solute hydrophobicity. The hydrophobicity of so
lutes is usually characterized by their hydration free energies8.
