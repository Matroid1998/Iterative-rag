Description:
A material with a wide bandgap of 6.2 eV, high dielectric constant, and high thermal conductivity, used in microelectronics and optoelectronics.

Text:
The properties of aluminum nitride (AlN), including a wide bandgap (6.2 eV), high dielectric 
constant (k  9), high electrical resistivity (  10111013  cm), and high thermal conductivity 
(2.85 WK cm)1 make it an important material in microelectronics and optoelectronics. AlN is 
also used in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS devices) due to its piezoelectric 
properties.2 Amorphous AlN finds uses e.g., as passivation and dielectric layers.3 Thin films of 
AlN are routinely deposited by reactive sputtering4, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)5, reactive 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)6, and atomic layer deposition (ALD).
