Description:
Used as a carbon source to produce highly 111-oriented 3CSiC.

Text:
The (110) and (111) 
planes are the two planes in 3CSiC with the lowest surface energy; 3.4 Jm2 and 4.2 Jm2, 
respectively 6. In the SiCl4based 3CSiC CVD processes, the preferred growth orientation of 
resultant coatings varies with the selection of hydrocarbons as well as the deposition 
conditions. It was reported that using CH4 as carbon source, highly 111oriented 3CSiC can 
be produced either at T  1200 , ptot  4 kPa7 or at 1200  T  1500 , ptot  40 kPa8. On the 
other hand, at T 1450 , ptot  1 kPa or at T  1450 , ptot  10 kPa, highly 110oriented 
3CSiC was obtained8.
