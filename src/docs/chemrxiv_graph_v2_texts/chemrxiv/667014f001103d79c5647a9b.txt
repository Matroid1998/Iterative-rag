Organometallic chemistry currently stands as one of the most dynamically advancing branches of 
chemistry. Within this domain, olefin metathesis plays a pivotal role, facilitating wideranging func
tionalisation of compounds containing carboncarbon double bonds.1 As a result, its application ex
tends to both industrial sectors such as petroleum and plastics, as well as laboratory settings.2 One of 
the current challenges of this methodology is to develop catalytic methods for the synthesis of olefins 
as a single stereoisomer, since the geometry of double bond has great influence on, for example, bio
logical activity of pharmaceutical ingredients or physical properties of polymers.3
