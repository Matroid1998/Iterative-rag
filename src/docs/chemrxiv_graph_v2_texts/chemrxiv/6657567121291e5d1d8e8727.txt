Description:
Compounds used in cancer therapy that destabilize microtubules.

This is perhaps most clearly seen in 
the drastic MT reorganizations needed for spindle formation 
during cell division, which render MTs a prime target for antimitotic 
drugs.5 Indeed, many MTdestabilising and MTstabilising 
compounds (vinca alkaloids, maytansines, taxanes, epothilones) 
have been developed for cancer therapy.6 As MTs are highly 
conserved, such small molecule drugs are also easily applicable 
across eukaryotic cell biology as tool compounds for cytoskeleton 
research. However, since so many different processes depend on 
MT architecture and dynamics, but all are modified at the same 
time by drug application, their practical utility for resolving MT
dependent biology is limited since they lack any spatiotemporal 
precision of action. Photopharmacology aims to develop photoresponsive drugs 
for just such spatiotemporally resolved studies.
