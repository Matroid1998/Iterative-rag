Description:
A volatile organic compound that poses exposure risks in operating rooms.

Text:
It is wellknown that electrosurgery produces VOCs (volatile organic compounds) including 
formaldehyde and various particulate matter,1 exposing operating room personnel to harmful substances 
throughout the procedure. Developing methods and devices to combat exposure to formaldehyde and 
other harmful chemical agents will improve the environment of care.

Description:
Classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

Text:
ASHRAE 170 indicates minimum 
ventilation requirements for healthcare facilities (currently 20 ACH and positive pressure), however this 
specification does not indicate limits on air contamination levels and does not contain requirements that 
are adequate for all situations.2 There is a large interest in reducing formaldehyde exposure due to a 
number of associated health concerns including coughing, irritation and asthmalike symptoms.3,4 The 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified formaldehyde as carcinogenic to 

2 

humans.5 OSHA has specified a permissible exposure limit of 0.75 ppm as an 8 h timeweighted average 
as well as a shortterm exposure limit of 2 ppm over a 15minute period.6
