Description:
Subject to Cocatalysed C(8)H functionalization strategies including alkylation, amidation, and dienylation.

Text:
More recently, the use of ecorich, lowpriced, and 
environmentally benign cobalt complexes have received a 
tremendous attention in this regard.2b,11 
After Kanai and Matsunaga groups initial reports,12 high
valent CpCo Cp  pentamethylcyclopentadienyl metal 
complexes have been recognized as versatile and robust 
catalysts because of their excellent Lewis acidity, reactivity, 
and selectivity.10,13 However, so far only three strategies have 
been reported for Cocatalysed C(8)H functionalization of 
quinoline Noxides (QNOs) which include alkylation14 
amidation15 and dienylation16 (Scheme 1a). Scheme 1. C8functionalization of QNO
