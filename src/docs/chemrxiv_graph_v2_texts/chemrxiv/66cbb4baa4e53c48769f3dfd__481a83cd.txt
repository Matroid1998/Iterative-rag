Application of inspired nanomaterials from meteorite the tetrataenite(NiFe)
As demonstrated in the litterature, tetrataenite is a favorable materials coming from a mineral meteorite, NiFe is his chemical
composition. First, in 1988 Wasilewski, P 11 did a characterization of the magnetic mineral tetrataenite and its distinction
with isochemical taenite. So, it is described that taenite with 4857  of nickel is magnetically soft, however when changed
through atomic ordering below 320 C it becomes the novel magnetic mineral tetrataenite along with appreciable magnetic
hardness and other singular magnetic properties. Also, it noted that tetrataenite is omnipresent in chondrite meteorites,
happen as discrete grain, as a distinct taenite rim, and in the etched nebulous zone.
