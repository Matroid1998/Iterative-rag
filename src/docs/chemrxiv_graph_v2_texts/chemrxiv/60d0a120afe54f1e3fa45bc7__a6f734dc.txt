Description:
A layered cathode material used in lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
The cathode is a critical component for lithiumion batteries
(LIBs) to achieve high energy density, safe operation, and eco
nomical viability. Despite many technological advances in LIBs,
the cathode materials have barely evolved in the last 15 years. Those found in commercialised LIBs are still based on one of
the three systems layered LiCoO2
1, spinel LiMn2O4
2 and olivine
LiFePO4
3, all of which were rst proposed more than two decades
ago. Ironbased cathode materials are very attractive as Fe is one
of the most abundant transition metal in the upper crust with
very low production costs. LIBs with olivine LiFePO4 cathodes

Description:
Only half of the Li can be extracted.

Text:
The use of largersized polyanion groups,
however, places an upperlimit on the energy density, which in
turn offsets some of the benets of the low cost. On the other
hand, ironoxide based cathodes suffer from the low voltage due
to the Fe2Fe3 redox10, while attempts to utilize the Fe3Fe4
redox often leads to decomposition into other phases upon charg
ing1113. Substituting one element with another has been a fruitful
strategy for increasing the performance of cathode materials. Over the years, most of the research interests have been fo
cusing on cationic substitution, and materials such as layered
LiNixMnyCozO2
14 have been reported to have improved re
versible capacity over LiCoO2  only half of the Li can be extracted
in the latter.
