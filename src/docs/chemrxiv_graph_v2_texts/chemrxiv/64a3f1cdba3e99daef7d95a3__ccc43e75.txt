Description:
Esters of terpene alcohols used in cosmetics, fragrances, flavours, and pharmaceuticals.

Text:
Terpene esters, specifically acetate, propionate, and butyrate esters of geraniol and citronellol 
are commercially useful and highly sought after in the cosmetics, fragrances, flavours and 
pharmaceutical industries. Likewise, global industries for flavours and fragrances are 
expanding rapidly, and it is projected to reach 33.39 billion in 2023 at a compound annual 
growth rate of 4.9 1. Currently, these compounds are obtained naturally through plants and 
flower extracts or produced synthetically via esterification or transesterification of terpene 
alcohols 2. However, both routes are limited by harsh operating conditions, a high footprint 
of hazardous chemicals, extensive downstream processing due to byproducts, and expensive 
process economics. 3.

Description:
Synthesized from geraniol and citronellol using enzymatic processes.

Text:
Research on enzymatic synthesis routes for these terpene esters from geraniol and citronellol 
has gained popularity over the last decade owing to the increasing demand for environmentally 
greener processes. They offer several benefits such as milder reaction conditions, reusability, 
and less byproducts owing to the regio and stereoselectivity of enzymes. 4. Lipases from 
Pseudomonas Fluorescens and Candida Antarctica have been effectively employed in various 
reactions such as esterification 5 and transesterification 6. The kinetics and mechanisms of 
these enzymatic processes have also been well reported in literature 712. The utilisation of 
microwave irradiation combined with enzymes has shown an enhancement of the 
biotransformation process and reduction of energy consumption 13. Adarme et al.
