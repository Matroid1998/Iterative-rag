Description:
A metal used in nonplatinum chemotherapeutic alternatives.

Text:
Ruthenium complexes were found amid the most promising nonplatinum chemotherapeutic 
alternatives17,18. Organometallic complexes based of the ruthenium(II)arene scaffold constitute an 
important direction of study. Pioneered by RAPTAC19 (Ru(II)(6pMeC6H4Pri)(PTA)(Cl)2 
(PTA  1,3,5triaza7phosphatricyclo3.3.1decane)) and RM17520 (Ru(II)(6C6H5C6H5)(en)Cl 
(en  ethylenediamine)) complexes, the Ru(II)arene moiety has been used in a myriad of compounds 
to 
improve 
anticancer 
activity 
and 
selectivity2125, 
but 
also 
for 
other 
therapeutic 
applications11,13,16,26. A particular class of compounds containing this unit are the trithiolatobridged dinuclear 
ruthenium(II)arene complexes (AC in Figure 1), which show not only high antiproliferative activity 
against cancer cells27, but also promising antiparasitic properties28,29. The structure of these 
complexes is based on a trigonal bipyramidal Ru2S3 framework, with two ruthenium(II)arene half
sandwich units.
