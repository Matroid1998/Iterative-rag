Description:
An atom that, when present at the C4 position of a phenyl ring, promotes product formation.

of 
electrondonating functionalities or extended aromatic systems on one of the aromatic substituents of the donor  as in amines 
C, D and E  proved to be beneficial, enhancing the efficiency of the photochemical arylation protocol up to 47 NMRyield 
(using donor E). The 1naphthyldiphenylamine core of E was selected to continue donor optimization The presence of a chlorine 
atom at the C4position of one of the two phenyl rings of donor G promoted the formation of 4 in 61 yield (isolated in 55 yield).
