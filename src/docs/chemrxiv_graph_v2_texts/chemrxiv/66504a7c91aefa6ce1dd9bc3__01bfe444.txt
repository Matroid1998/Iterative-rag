Description:
Used as an acceptor in position 7 in certain compounds.

Text:
For this reason, most TADF emitters based on fluorene are designed 
to display through space ICT,34,35 whereas DA 2,7substituted fluorene derivatives rarely dis
play TADF behavior. Noteworthy, examples employing nitrile as acceptor in position 7 and 
phenoxazine36 or triphenylamine37 in position 2 as donor are not showing TADF emission, 
but emission from hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT) states.38
