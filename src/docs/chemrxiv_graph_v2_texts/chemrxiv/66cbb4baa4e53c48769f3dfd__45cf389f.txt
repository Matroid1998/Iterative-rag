Description:
Used as the media for electrochemical characterization in 1.0 M concentration.

In fact, the elaborated materials (NiFeG) shows outstanding properties for the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER), such as overpotential (0.21 V vs RHE), low OER onset potential (1.44 V vs RHE and a reduced
overpotential at 10 mAcm2 (10  266 mV). The electrochemical characterization of the evaluated materials in 1.0 M KOH
media are shown in Fig.2, which shows a huge different in the considered materials with greater performance of NiFeG for
the OER. Fig.1  The XPS Analysis of the synthesized (NiFeG) catalyst, Reprinted with permission from 12 copyright  2024, Royal Society of Chemistry. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20246p4pr ORCID httpsorcid.org0009000421328571 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
