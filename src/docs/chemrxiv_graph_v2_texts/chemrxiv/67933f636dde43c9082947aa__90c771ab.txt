Description:
Subject of the first total synthesis involving a diastereoselective Claisen rearrangement followed by enolate alkylation.

published the asymmetric synthesis 
of an intermediate in this route, thus completing the first, and 
to this day only, (formal) enantioselective synthesis of any 
member of the ginkgolide family.17 In 1999, Crimmins reported 
the second total synthesis of ()ginkgolide B, which also 
employed a 22 cycloaddition to forge the contiguous 
quaternary stereocentres (Figure 1B).18, 19 More recently, in 
2022, Barriault described the first total synthesis of ()
ginkgolide C and formal synthesis of ()ginkgolides A and B.20 
In this instance, the adjacent allcarbon stereocentres were 
constructed via a diastereoselective Claisen rearrangement 
followed by an enolate alkylation (Figure 1B). The published synthetic routes to the ginkgolides share 
similarities. Firstly, they all employed pericyclic reactions to 
construct the challenging allcarbon contiguous quaternary 
stereocentres.
