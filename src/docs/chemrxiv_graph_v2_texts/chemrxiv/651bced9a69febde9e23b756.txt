Description:
A compound involved in electrochemical reduction reactions for renewable energy applications.

Text:
Due to pollution, climate change, and the need to store and produce renewable energy sustainably
and effectively, there is an acute need for CO2 utilization methods such as electrochemical CO2
reduction (CO2R).16 As a result of this, scientific and industrial interest in CO2R has increased
greatly over the last few decades. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is complex, in large
part due to the many different products and reaction pathways.1,7,8 To achieve performance good
enough for industrial applications, however, understanding and tuning the CO2RR to give specific
products with high enough selectivity and activity is essential. (a)
