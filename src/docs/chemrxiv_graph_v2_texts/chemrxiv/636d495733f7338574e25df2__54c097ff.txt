Description:
A late transition metal utilized in the active site for CC bond activation.

Text:
CC bond activation has been achieved on the surface of heterogenous catalysts,4 within the active 
sites of enzymes,5 and under homogenous conditions using metal complexes.6,7 Reported reactivity 
typically employs a late transition metal (Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt) as part of the active site for CC activation.8 
Reactivity often follows classical mechanisms, divided into two broad classes i) the direct oxidative 
addition of the transition metal to the CC bond;9 ii) alkyl elimination at a metal centre (Figure 1);10 
Alkyl migration can be defined as a subclass of alkyl elimination, wherein the substrate remains 
intact on the transition metal throughout the pathway.
