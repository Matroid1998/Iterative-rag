Description:
A promising energy carrier with high energy density and environmentally benign properties.

Text:
The excessive reliance on fossil fuels has led to severe environmental pollution and global 
warming, creating an urgent need for renewable and clean energy sources as alternatives1,2. Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy carrier for meeting clean energy demands due to 
its high energy density and environmentally benign properties3. Electrocatalytic hydrogen 
production offers an economical and efficient approach to achieving a closed carbon cycle4. Currently, platinum (Pt) stands as the most efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER) in acidic media due to its favorable electronic structure, which facilitates 
moderate binding energy with hydrogen ions, a crucial attribute for achieving efficient catalytic 
performance5,6.

Description:
Involved in HER activity by modulating adsorption energy through interactions and charge transfer mechanisms.

Text:
The 
synergetic effects of these phases can lead to improved HER activity by modulating the 
hydrogen adsorption energy due to different interactions and charge transfer mechanisms at the 
phase interfaces13,14. Despite recent studies on molybdenum carbide phase optimization in 
alkaline media15, little work has been reported on optimizing tungsten carbide phases for
