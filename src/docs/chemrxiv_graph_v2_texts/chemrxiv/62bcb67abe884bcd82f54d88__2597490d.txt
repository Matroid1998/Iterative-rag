Description:
Facilitates energy storage in a hydrogen-fueled society.

Text:
To halt the global temperature increase, drastic transitions in 
energy production and storage are required. During the last 
decade, the global electricity production by renewable energy 
duplicated and is predicted to keep growing rapidly.1 However, a 
major problem for the large scale implementation of renewable 
energies is the mismatch between production and demand. Compensating this discrepancy requires matching buffer 
capacities. The key principle for a hydrogen fueled society is to 
facilitate hydrogen (H2) as a storable energy carrier. In this 
scenario, excess energy is used in water electrolysis to produce 
hydrogen.
