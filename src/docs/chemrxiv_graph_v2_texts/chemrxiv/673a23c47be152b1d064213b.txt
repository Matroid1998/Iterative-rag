Description:
Used in oxidative degradation to break down organic matter.

Text:
Through the usage of oxidative degradation
methods2 the organic matter in toilet paper can be broken down and isolated from microplastics alongside
other unintended organic material, similar to how toilet paper can be decomposed with microplastics
being left behind in the environment. This papers hypothesis is that recycled toilet paper contains a higher concentration of microplastics than
nonrecycled toilet paper when tested in a shredded state; and tested with oxidative degradation using
hydrogen peroxide and filtration for microplastics. Variables
