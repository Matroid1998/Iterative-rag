Description:
A reducing agent used in enzymatic reductive amination by imine reductases and reductive aminases.

Text:
Enzymatic reductive amination has long been limited to the 
preparation of amino acids from keto acids using amino acid 
dehydrogenases and the synthesis of chiral primary amines from 
ketones using transaminases (the latter being a reversible group 
transfer process).916 Recently, however, the scope of biocatalytic re
ductive amination has been significantly expanded with the discov
ery that imine reductases (IREDs)  and in particular a subclass of 
this enzyme family termed reductive aminases (RedAms)  are able 
to perform this reaction with a broad range of amine and carbonyl 
substrates using NADPH as the reducing agent.1722
Following the initial discovery of asymmetric reductive ami
nation by IREDs and RedAms,2325 sequencebased and metagen
omic enzyme discovery efforts have rapidly generated extensive 
libraries of these biocatalysts,2630 and protein engineering has been 
used to tailor them to specific target reactions.3141 Within a decade, 
IREDcatalysed reductive amination has progressed from proof of 
concept to industrial application,19 including the recent syntheses of 
a lysinespecific demethylase1 (LSD1) inhibitor,31 a Janus kinase 1 
(JAK1) inhibitor,32 and a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor on a 
kilogramton scale.36,37 Despite these advances, the scope and limi
tations of asymmetric reductive amination catalysed by IREDs and 
RedAms need to be further explored.
