Description:
Dominant member of the polycarbonate family used for its optical properties, impact resistance, and flame retardancy.

The everincreasing production of plastics and its 
consequences in terms of waste, the release of microplastics 
and pollutants into the natural environment, has led to the 
urgent need to examine the endoflife of polymers. The 
global percentage of recycled plastic is estimated to be only 
16 , and largely depends on the polymer considered, as well 
as its form of use.1 Polycarbonates are one of the socalled 
commodity polymers, with a global annual market 
estimated at 4.7 million metric tons, making them the fifth
largest heteroatomcontaining polymer market.1 This 
family of polymers, largely dominated by poly(bisphenol A 
carbonate) (PBPAC), is used for its optical properties, impact 
resistance, flame retardancy, etc.
