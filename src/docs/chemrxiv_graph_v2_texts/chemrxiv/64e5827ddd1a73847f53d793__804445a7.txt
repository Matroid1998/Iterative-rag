Nature 
synthesizes 
its 
most 
essential 
molecules 
like 
polynucleotides, 
polypeptides, 
and 
polysaccharides 
of 
remarkable structural and functional perfection by using only a 
few simple and robust chemical reactions and a very small library 
of monomers.1 Inspired by this, polymer science has witnessed 
a broad adaption of simple and highyielding chemistries to afford 
polymeric materials with precise control over architecture and 
functionality.2,3 Among these, the click chemistry, which is based 
on the concepts of modularity and orthogonality, has led to a 
significant change in design strategies and the overall approach 
to synthetic problems.4 Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx)the 
newgeneration click chemistry, is possible to create novel 
polymers containing sulfone and sulfoxide building blocks with 
fascinating properties through discrete hubs such as sulfuryl 
fluoride (SO2F2),57 thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4),810 and ethene
sulfonyl fluoride (ESF)11 (Figure 1a).
