Description:
Handling of small zeolite nanocrystals is complicated due to their refractory nature to mechanical recovery by filtration or decantation.

to reduce the diffusion 
path length within the inorganic walls andor to increase 
the external surface area 4. Thus, TS1 can be shaped

as 
nanosheets

membranes 10, etc. Another way out is to add a 
secondary porosity 1114, with benefits in terms of 
active site accessibility. This was previously reported 
for micromesoporous TS1 1517, but the strategy 
was also shown to be applicable to micromacroporous 
TS1 18 as well as three level micromeso
macroporous structures 1921 and hollow TS1 
crystals 22,23. More simply, the crystals size can be 
reduced in order to increase the catalytic performance. On the second hand, the handling of small zeolite 
nanocrystals is complicated because such colloidal 
objects are refractory to mechanical recovery by 
filtration or decantation.
