Breaks down into salicylic acid and acetic acid when exposed to excess heat and humidity.

Scope 
Aspirin is used for a variety of reasons, from reducing fever to providing relief for mild pain associated with 
headaches, menstrual cramps, and arthritis (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Its versatility leads to 
aspirin tablets being present in almost every home, which makes the consequences of their mishandling that much 
more impactful. Generally, patients are instructed not to store aspirin in areas exposed to excess heat and humidity as 
they cause aspirin to break down into salicylic acid and acetic acid (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Salicylic acid is the substance responsible for aspirins medicinal properties, and fluctuations in its concentration can 
lead to dosage inaccuracies. This leads to questions and concerns about the correlation between temperature and the 
concentration of salicylic acid within hydrolyzed aspirin.

Background Information 
The active ingredient in aspirin tablets is acetylsalicylic acid, a salicylate. Salicylates are esters of salicylic acid, the 
substance that aspirin owes its antiinflammatory properties to (Aspirin MedlinePlus Drug Information, n.d.). Acetylsalicylic acid is therefore, along with acetic acid, one of the products of the esterification of salicylic acid with 
acetic anhydride. Once an aspirin tablet is ingested and enters the small intestine, the acetylsalicylic acid undergoes a 
hydrolysis reaction, where acetylsalicylic acid reacts with water to break the ester bond and produce salicylic acid and 
acetic acid, as shown in Figure 1 (Awtry  Loscalzo, 2000, The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1998).
