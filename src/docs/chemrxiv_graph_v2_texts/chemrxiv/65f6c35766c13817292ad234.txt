Description:
Used in varying volume fractions in the aqueous eluent for measuring sorption behavior.

Text:
They measured k at varying volume fractions 
of methanol (MeOH) in the aqueous eluent and extrapolated k at 
100  water (k0) for each surfactant. Since k0 reflects the actual 
sorption behavior from water to an organic solid phase (i.e., C18 
phase), it can serve as a useful hydrophobicity indicator. While 
there have been decades of research employing LC retention 
measurements 
to 
characterize 
hydrophobic 
partition 
properties,17 most studies have been aimed at estimating Kow 
values for LC retention. The use of an LC approach is particularly 
sensible for anionic compounds because an alternative to Kow is 
required for this group of compounds.
