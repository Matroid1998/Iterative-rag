Description:
Tin-based perovskites have similar or superior electronic and optical properties to lead-containing systems.

Text:
Tin replacement for lead in MHPs is a pervasive strategy not only to provide less toxic materials 
but also to reduce the band gap towards the optimum according to the ShockleyQueisser limit.26,27 
In addition, tinbased perovskites have similar or superior electronic and optical properties to lead
containing systems, such as higher charge carrier mobilities and longlived hot carriers.28 In the field 
of chiral perovskites, except for the (RSMBA)2SnI4 system (MBA methylbenzylammonium), no 
other tinbased materials have been reported so far. However, in view of potential future applications 
in chiral optoelectronic devices, the use of tin could guarantee a reduced environmental impact and 
provide the degree of optical properties tunability required.
