Description:
Explored for high entropy compositions in ceramics.

Text:
High entropy chemical compositions is a rapidly emerging approach to design functional oxides. Following 
early studies of mechanical properties of metal alloys with 5 or more elements in single phase solid solution, 
1,2 high entropy has later been explored for oxides and ceramics,39 e.g. rock salts,10 perovskites,11,12 
oxyfluorides,13 and carbides.14 High entropy compounds are usually defined by having a configurational 
entropy, Sconfig, larger than 1.5R, where R is the universal gas constant, which is achieved by 5 or more 
equimolar elements on the same sublattice.15 High configurational entropy can stabilize singlephase materials 
even if the compositional end members are unstable.2,10 High ionic conductivity is a prominent example of 
enhanced properties in high entropy oxides.
