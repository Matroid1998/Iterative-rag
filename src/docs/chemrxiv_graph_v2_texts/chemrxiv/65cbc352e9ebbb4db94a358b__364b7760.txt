Description:
Part of the heterogeneous spatial sequences in metal oxide rods of MOF74 chains.

Other methods to introduce complexity into MOFs include 
multiple metalations of metalcontaining building blocks12, 
postsynthetic modification13, or vacancy creation14. Ini
tially, scientists presumed that metals or linkers in these 
materials were evenly distributed in space, but solidstate 
NMR experiments combined with DFT calculations revealed 
that only one in four MTVMOF5 structures had a random 
distribution of linkers in space15. Atom probe tomography 
also demonstrated that the metals (Co, Cd, Pb, Mn) in metal
oxide rods of MOF74 chains had heterogeneous spatial se
quences.16 Both reports indicate that homogeneous distri
bution of metals or functional groups is rather rare.
