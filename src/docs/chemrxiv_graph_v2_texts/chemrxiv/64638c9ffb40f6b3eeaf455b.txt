Description:
Highly symmetric molecular systems belonging to the point group Ih, often called onionlike inorganic fullerenes.

Text:
Highly symmetric molecular systems belonging to the point group Ih have attracted a lot of interest in chemistry and physics. Because of their high molecular symmetric structure (Ih andor Th) and composed of inorganic elements they are often called 
onionlike inorganic fullerenes. Only a few combinations of elements show an energetic and computational stability which 
probably emanates from the total number of valence electrons involved. A tentative explanation can be given by a building 
rule involving the number of vertices and the ideal electron configuration.
