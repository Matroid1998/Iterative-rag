Description:
An expensive metal used in electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Text:
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a major process for energy conversion and 
storage, motivating considerable interest in improving the costeffectiveness of electrolyzers.15 
To lower the high cost of the electrocatalysts, which are currently made of expensive metals like 
platinum4,6 and iridium7, the precious metal concentration must be decreased. Dispersing the 
metals on supports as single atoms or subnanometer clusters can help lower the metal content by 
ensuring that every metal atom is accessible throughout the catalytic process. Due to their unique 
topologies and electronic properties, which are crucial to understanding their chemisorption 
properties, small nanoclusters are also interesting from a fundamental perspective.
