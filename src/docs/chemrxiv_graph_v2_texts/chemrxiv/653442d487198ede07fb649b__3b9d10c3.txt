Description:
Produced via polycondensation of diol or diester monomers with HDPE-like thermomechanical properties.

Text:
Several notable recent advances were made towards circular HDPElike polymers with closed
loop chemical recyclability through incorporation of cleavable linkages such as ester bonds into 
the PE backbones. In 2021, longchain alkyl polyester produced via polycondensation of diol 
or diester monomers26,27 was reported to possess HDPElike thermomechanical properties23.In 
2022, another approach to circular HDPElike polyester was developed using the diester end
capped PE obtained via tandem dehydrogenationmetathesis of postconsumer HDPE24 or 
tandem ethylene copolymerization with an oxanorbornene comonomer, retroDielsAlder 
reaction, and metathesis25 (Fig. 1b).
