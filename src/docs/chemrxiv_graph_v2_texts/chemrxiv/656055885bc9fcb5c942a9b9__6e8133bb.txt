Description:
Used in foams and modified variants to balance activity for the HER, recyclability, and safety.

Text:
12 Electrocatalysts are needed for the HER, and these electrodes are usually dependent 
on platinumgroup metals due to their low overpotential.1315 However, the scarcity and high cost of 
platinum hinders their widespread application.1618 Ni foams and their modified variants can provide a 
good balance between activity for the HER, recyclability, and safety.1921
