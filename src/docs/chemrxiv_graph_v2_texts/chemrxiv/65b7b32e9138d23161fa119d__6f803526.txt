Description:
A source for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from the atmosphere or emission sources.

Text:
Irrespective of the desirable reduction in the combustion of fossil fuels, carbon capture 
and sequestration (CCS) is needed to remove CO2 from both the atmosphere and 
industrial processes in order for Climate targets to be met (Seneviratne et al., 2016) 
and Nations to reach Net Zero (Pye et al., 2017; Frster et al., 2022). The carbon 
source for CCS can be either via direct air capture from the atmosphere, from an 
emission source, or using CO2 separated from an emission source. Direct air capture 
(DAC) has an issue that the natural concentration in the air is low (412 ppm, 0.04) 
and thus any chemical reaction is slow (Zhu, 2022).
