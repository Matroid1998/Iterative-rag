Description:
An oxidizing stoichiometric reagent used in the oxidation of alcohols.

Text:
controlling the reaction without leading to complete oxidation, requires highly selective 
catalysts with tailormade properties.1 Primary alcohols can be selectively oxidized to aldehydes, but over
oxidation can likely occur, leading to the formation of carboxylic acids; secondary alcohols can be oxidized 
to ketones, which are generally not further oxidized as ketone oxidation can only occur through CC bond 
cleavage.2 Oxidations of alcohols are traditionally carried out in anaerobic conditions using oxidizing 
stoichiometric reagents such as CrO3, KMnO4, MnO2, SeO2, and Br2.3 Unfortunately, these methods often 
rely on costly oxidizing agents, leading to both economic and environmental concerns.
