The impact of the saturation increase rate on the width of the metastability zone for 
113 
gypsum, barite, and some carbonate phases (witherite, strontianite) where previously determined 
114 
for diffusioncontrolled systems at ambient temperatures (Prieto et al., 1994). These experiments 
115 
found a dependency between the rate of saturation increase and the oversaturation at which the 
116 
nucleation occurs. However, due to the slow rate of diffusion and subsequent long induction times 
117 
(weeks to months) compared to the duration of fluid transport and induction during energy 
118 
production (typically up to a couple of hours) these results are not directly applicable to energy 
119 
production scenarios. 120
