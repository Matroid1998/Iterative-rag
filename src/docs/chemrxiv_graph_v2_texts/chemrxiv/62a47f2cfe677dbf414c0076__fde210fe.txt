Description:
Added in low contents to boost electrode capacity in advanced batteries.

Since silicon has recently been added to 
advanced batteries, few studies have addressed the optimization of the 
manufacturing steps. Today, much of the silicon added in advanced batteries for 
electric vehicles is combined with graphite. In particular, Si is added in low 
contents ( 10 wt) to boost the electrode capacity while buffering silicon volume 
expansion and benefiting from the wellbehaved graphite cycling.
