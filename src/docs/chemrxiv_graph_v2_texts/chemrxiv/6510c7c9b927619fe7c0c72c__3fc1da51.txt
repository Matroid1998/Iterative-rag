Description:
A catalyst used for the aziridination of styrenyl and some unactivated substrates.

However, 
these methods have focused on the aziridination of 
activated alkenes such as styrenes and ,unsaturated 
systems 
(Scheme 
1a, 
top). The 
stereoselective 
aziridination 
of 
unactivated 
alkenes 
with 
alkyl 
substitutions remains challenging (Scheme 1a, bottom).30 
As a result, only four methods that are capable of 
conducting intermolecular enantioselective aziridinations 
on unactivated alkenes have been reported. A Co(II) 
porphyrin catalyst developed by Zhang was shown to 
aziridinate a variety of styrenyl substrates along with a 
small number of unactivated substrates.31 A report by 
Katuski using a Ru(II)salen catalyst also showed the 
aziridination of a small number of unactivated alkenes 
alongside activated systems.32 In 2022, Dauban reported 
on the asymmetric aziridination of tetra substituted
