Description:
Used as a cofeed in thermocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation.

Nearly 200 million tons 
are produced annually, the most of any organic compound, with ethylene being an intermediate in 
5060 of all plastics.1 The vast majority of ethylene is derived from the steam cracking of 
petroleum, a process which unavoidably introduces impurities into the crude ethylene stream.1b,2 
From the standpoint of plastics production, the most pernicious of these contaminants is acetylene, 
which poisons the ZieglerNatta catalysts that polymerize ethylene into plastics.1b,2b,3 Typically, 
crude ethylene streams contain 0.52 acetylene by volume; prior to plastics production, removal 
of the acetylene impurity is imperative.1b,3 
The current industrial standard for thermocatalytic acetylene semihydrogenation has 
weaknesses in that it uses high temperatures and pressures, H2 cofeed, and precious metal Pd 
catalysts.4 This reaction is additionally prone to overhydrogenation to ethane, a less valuable 
product that also inhibits polymerization of ethylene, and therefore must be removed using 
cryogenic sublimation prior to plastics production.5 The use of Pd and excess H2 as cofeed limits 
the ethylene selectivity of the thermocatalytic process to 85 with 90 conversion at 200 C.2b,3 
Recently, physisorptionbased acetylene purification6 or electro7 and photocatalytic routes 
have been pursued, by our research groups and others, to avoid the drawbacks of the 
thermochemical routes.3 We sought to improve upon selectivity and conversion by designing 
photocatalytic systems based on Coporphyrin catalysts, and succeeded in creating both a 
homogenous system based on mesotetra(4sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinatocobalt(III)8 and a 
heterogeneous system based on the metalorganic framework (MOF) CoPCN222 (with meso
tetra(4carboxyphenyl)porphyrinatocobalt(III) linkers).9 Notably, both achieved nearly 100 
conversion with 99 selectivity for ethylene over ethane under industrially relevant conditions
