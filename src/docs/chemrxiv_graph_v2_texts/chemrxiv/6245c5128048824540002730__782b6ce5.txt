Description:
An amorphous component used in a nanocomposite with WO2.72 nanocrystals for enhanced capacity retention in EC devices.

Text:
However, since all dualband EC devices developed thus far include a polaronic 
component, their capacity may be substantially reduced after a few hundred cycles (Table 1). Among those reported, the composite of ITO with NbOx glass made by Llordes et al.5 and a 
nanocomposite of WO2.72 nanocrystals with amorphous Nb2O5x37 showed the best capacity 
retention after 2000 cycles (Figure 5b). However, for application as smart windows in buildings, 
EC devices should withstand at least 50,000 cycles, as well as strenuous thermal cycling, without 
much degradation.
