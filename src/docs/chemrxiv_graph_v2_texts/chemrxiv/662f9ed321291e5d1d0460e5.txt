Description:
A salt form used for stabilizing compounds.

Text:
of 
a MOMprotecting group and was stable as a TFA or HCl salt. Although acyclic 1 demonstrated 
poor pharmacokinetics with high in vivo clearance in mice, the cyclic 2 showed improved 
plasma exposure. The potential use of dihydropyrazolo1,5apyrazin4(5H)ones as prodrugs for 
the acyclic bamidomethylvinyl sulfone warhead was demonstrated by GSH capture 
experiments. Graphical Abstract
