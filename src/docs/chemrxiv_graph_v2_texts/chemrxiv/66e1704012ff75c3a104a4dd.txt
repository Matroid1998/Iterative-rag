Description:
Has large ligand field effects and too large energy separations between states for thermally driven spin-state transitions.

Text:
Switching between these states is
possible through external stimuli such as changes in temperature, pressure, high magnetic
fields, or through light excitation.5,6 However, for most of the previously investigated molec
ular switch materials that have a stable LS state at room temperature, the quintet lifetime
is usually too short for practical applications.7
Fe(terpy)22 has large ligand field effects and consequently too large energy separations
between states for thermally driven spinstate transitions, yet it remains promising because
the utilization of tridentate ligands are expected to lead to longlived quintet states at rela
