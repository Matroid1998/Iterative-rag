Description:
Exhibits bright photoluminescence when encapsulated into crystalline melamine.

This hinders their applications in
lightemitting diodes that require highly ecient concentrated emitters in solid states. In this article we demonstrate that bright photoluminescence from TCNQ, which hardly
luminesces in its solid state, by encapsulating it into crystalline melamine. The photolumi
nescence quantum yields of TCNQ and the anion radical TCNQ.are typically low due to
fast (ps  fs) internal conversion 6, 7. A better luminescence quantum yield was reported
only for some nonpolar solvents 8, 9, and prolonged uorescence lifetimes for some micro
solvation complexes of TCNQ 10. Melamine, or 2,4,6Triamino1,3,5triazine, is able to
withstand strong ultraviolet radiation, which also might be a likely reason for its abundance
in the primordial soup.

Description:
Used as a dopant in the synthesis of doped melamine single crystals.

Text:
Melamineformaldehyde resins are widely used in a variety of plastic
products such as kitchenwares as well as coating. Neutral melamine, e.g. melamine in water,
is colorless and absorbs ultraviolet light 1112 and uoresces ultraviolet light 1314. It is
therefore a perfect host that is transparent in the visible range. Doped melamine single crystals are synthesised by mixing an aqueous solution of melamine
and a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of TCNQ, followed by crystallisation by vaporization
at room temperature. The doping level is tuned by varing the molar ratio of melamine
and TCNQ in the aqueous THF. Mass spectrometry combined with UVVis spectroscopy
elucidates that the dopants are TCNQ and dicyanoptoluoyl cyanide (DCTC), an oxidation
product of TCNQ.
