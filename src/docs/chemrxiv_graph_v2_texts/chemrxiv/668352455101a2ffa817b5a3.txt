Cyclobutanes are privileged fourmembered synthetic targets 
because they are versatile skeletons of natural products and 
pharmaceuticals with diverse biological properties,1 and also 
serve as key intermediates in the synthesis of structurally complex 
molecules.2 Among these, cyclobutyl amines stand out as pivotal 
cores in medicinal development, which can be found in a large 
variety of bioactive molecules, as illustrated in Scheme 1A.3 
Therefore, the development of novel strategies for synthesizing 
cyclobutyl amines, preferably with stereocontrol, would not only 
enrich the toolkit of synthetic chemists but also significantly 
expand the compound library available for drug discovery.
