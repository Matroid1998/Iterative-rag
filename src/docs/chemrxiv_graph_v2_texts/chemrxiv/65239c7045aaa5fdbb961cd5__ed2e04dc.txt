Description:
Complexes exhibiting both light dependent and independent antibacterial activity against drug-resistant bacteria.

were the first to highlight that the antibacterial properties of a 
trimetallic metal compound could be attributed to the presence of a rhenium tricarbonyl 
moiety in the structure.13 Mode of action studies attributed the activity of this compound 
to its detrimental effect on the bacterial cell membrane, causing depolarization but not 
pore formation. However, due to unfavorable solubility and cytotoxicity properties, the 
compounds were not evaluated further. More recently, several groups have 
investigated metal complexes based on the Re(CO)3scaffold. Frei et al. reported on 
dualmode of action bisquinoline rhenium tricarbonyl complexes which exhibited both 
light dependent and independent antibacterial activity against drugresistant Gram
positive and Gramnegative bacteria.14 The group of Zobi have shown that fac
Re(CO)3 diimine compounds show activity against Grampositive bacteria, including 
drugresistant ones.
