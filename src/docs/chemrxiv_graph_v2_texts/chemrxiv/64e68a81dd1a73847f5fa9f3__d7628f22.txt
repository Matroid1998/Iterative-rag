Description:
Stereochemistry at the carbon stereogenic center significantly influences the potency of BACE1 inhibitors.

of the SIA functional group 
into biologically active compounds has become an increasingly 
attractive target to medicinal chemists over the last two 
decades. More specifically, heterocyclic SIAs have started to 
emerge as an important structural motif in medicinally relevant 
molecules. This is exemplified by Novartiss NLRP3 
compound6 and HoffmannLa Roches BACE1 inhibitors for 
Alzheimers Disease7 (Figure 1A).8 It was discovered that the 
stereochemistry at both the carbon and sulfur stereogenic 
centers significantly influenced the potency of the resulting 
BACE1 inhibitors.1,7 
Despite the promising potential bioactivity of SIAs, synthetic 
reports of enantioenriched SIA heterocycles are rare.9,10 This 
notable absence in the literature is due to the fact that, until 
recently, methods to access SIAs containing enantiopure sulfur 
centers were limited.
