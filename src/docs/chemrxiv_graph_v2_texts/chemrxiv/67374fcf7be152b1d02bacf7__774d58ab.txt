Description:
Treatment with H2 affects the oxygen defects and Ni aggregation on LaNiO3.

Text:
of oxygen defects, especially after H2 treatment 
where NiLa reaches 3.51. The presence of oxygen vacancies leads to the aggregation 
of Ni on the surface of LaNiO3, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the OER 
performance of LaNiO3. In addition, the OER activity of both LaNiO3 and oxygen 
vacancy rich LaNiO3 decreases upon cyclic voltammetry (CV) between 1.0 V and 
1.5 V vs. RHE with proceeding cycle numbers. XPS results reveal that the CV 
treatments lead to the decrease of Ni concentration at the LaNiO3 surface, which is an 
important factor for the decrease in the OER performance of LaNiO3 as well as oxygen 
vacancy rich LaNiO3. Keywords LaNiO3, oxygen evolution reaction, electronic structure, oxygen 
vacancies
