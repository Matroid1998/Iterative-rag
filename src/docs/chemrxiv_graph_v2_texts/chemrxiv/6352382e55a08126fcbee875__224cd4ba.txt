Description:
A hydrazine-based derivative extensively used as a liquid hypergolic fuel due to its good propulsion and combustion characteristics.

In contrast, 
liquid propellants typically have the advantages of great specific impulse, regulable propulsion, multiple 
ignition start, and easy control of thrust,4 which is the most widelyused propellant in the world today. Currently, in a propellant system, hydrazinebased derivatives, especially unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine 
(UDMH), have been extensively used as liquid hypergolic fuels due to their good propulsion and combustion 
characteristics.
