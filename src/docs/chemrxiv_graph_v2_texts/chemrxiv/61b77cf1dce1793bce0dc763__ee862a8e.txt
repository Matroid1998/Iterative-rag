Description:
Used as electrodes in water-based batteries due to slow kinetics of hydrogen evolution.

One example appears in re
dox flow batteries (RFBs), which offer the potential to de
liver a lowcost and reliable energy storage solution at the 
gridscale.1 While vanadiumbased RFB chemistries are cur
rently the most wellstudied, battery formulations using or
ganic molecules as the active species are a promising alter
native as they are domestically manufacturable, decoupled 
from markets for transition metals, and have a lesser eco
logical footprint.24 The stability window of the solvent de
termines the desired electrochemical potential for both an
ode and cathode halfreactions for waterbased batteries, 
this dictates a maximum thermodynamically stable voltage 
of 1.23 V at 25C, although in practice voltages of approxi
mately 2.0 V are possible due to the slow kinetics of hydro
gen evolution on carbon electrodes.5 
A wide range of organic redox couples exist and have been 
explored as charge carriers in flow battery applications.6 
Among these, persistent organic radicals are a promising 
class of active species with highly reversible redox pro
cesses.7 These molecules have an unpaired valence electron 
that can either be donated or paired with an accepted elec
tron to form a closedshell species.
