Description:
Forms the basis of a mesoionic carbene used in CO2 conversion.

Text:
The first report on 
transition metalfree CO2 capture from air, including the consecutive reduction of the CO2 to produce a 
methanol precursor, which can be easily converted into methanol under ambient conditions, was made 
by the group of Mandal in 2019.20 They reported an imidazolebased mesoionic carbene (Figure 1) 
supported 9BBN adduct, which is able to perform the described conversion, including a thorough 
investigation of the mechanistic pathway.
