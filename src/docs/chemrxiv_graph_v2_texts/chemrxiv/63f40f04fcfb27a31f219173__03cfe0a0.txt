Description:
Obtained quantitatively from TiF4 and (CH3)3SiN3 in acetonitrile at room temperature, featuring a linear azide coordination.

Several titanium compounds with azide functionality exist that could be utilized to expand the click 
chemistry of the metal. Easily accessible titanium tetra azide Ti(N3)4 obtained quantitatively within 
minutes from TiF4 and (CH3)3SiN3 in acetonitrile at room temperature, features a linear azide 
coordination, whereas the 5 and 6coordinated complexes P(C6H5)4Ti(N3)5 and P(C6H5)42Ti(N3)6 
respectively, demonstrate a bent azide configuration2a. The structural difference of the linear vs. bent 
azide has been rationalized on the basis of the electron backdonation of the nitrogen atom. In the 
Figure 1. Linear and bent configurations of titanium triazides
special case of tetracoordinate do metals, all three electron pairs on the nitrogen atoms can donate 
electron density into three lobes of empty dorbitals tetrahedrally arranged about the (IV) central 
metal.
