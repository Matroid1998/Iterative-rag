Description:
Referenced in the context of Me2Al(THF)2 content in MAO samples.

Text:
That the source and Me3Al content of MAO is 
an important variable is revealed by PGSE NMR studies on h
MAO (Sigma Aldrich), where dried or chemically modified MAO 
(DMAO and MAOBHT), and the ionpairs formed from 
Cp2ZrMe2 and DMAO had larger dimensions than the 
commercial material.23
