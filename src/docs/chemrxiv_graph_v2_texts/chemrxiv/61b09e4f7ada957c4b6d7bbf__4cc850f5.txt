Description:
Used with metal-based catalysts to enable alkene coupling without waste generation.

For our first study, we selected the field of aalkylation of 
carbonyls as it is a central and wellestablished transfor
mation in organic synthesis that could still benefit from im
provement (Figure 1).4 Indeed, the coupling of enolates 
with nucleofugecontaining molecules under basic condi
tions is extensively employed, but its low atomeconomy 
makes it often industrially impracticable.5 Similarly, mod
ern procedures employing a combination of a metalbased 
catalyst with directing amines have allowed the use of al
kenes as coupling partners, which circumvent any waste 
generation.6 However, the expensive catalysts andor rea
gents employed in these protocols make them difficult to 
implement on scale.
