Description:
The radical cation of allene is governed by complex nonBornOppenheimer dynamics and relaxes by a JahnTeller distortion into a chiral D2 symmetry energy minimum.

Text:
The radical cation of allene is an oftstudied system, in part be
cause the vertical structure constitutes one of the simplest D2d
symmetry conical intersections.16 Processes relating to the re
moval of an electron from allene are thus governed by complex
nonBornOppenheimer dynamics.79 The vertical cation relaxes
by a JahnTeller (JT) distortion into a chiral D2 symmetry energy
minimum.1013 The radical cation of spiropentadiene is a simi
lar case,14 and we shall elaborate on their neutral and cationic
electronic structures in terms of their helical orbitals. The system of allene can be represented in two different
ways by its canonical frontier molecular orbitals (MOs).1521 The
degenerate highest occupied MO (HOMO) and HOMO1 can be
symmetry adapted to the different symmetry operations of the
D2d point group.

Description:
Has rectilinear molecular orbitals that are symmetry-adapted to mirror operations.

Text:
The two mirror plane elements and the two off
axis C2 rotation axes are shown in Figure 1a. The conventional
rectilinear MOs of allene are symmetryadapted to the mirror
operations. If we instead symmetryadapt the MOs to the two
rotation operations we get the two helical orbitals shown in Fig
ure 1a. The choice between these two pictures is arbitrary.2022
The mixing of the systems is mediated by the porbitals on the
central carbon, which forms a basis with continuous overlap be
