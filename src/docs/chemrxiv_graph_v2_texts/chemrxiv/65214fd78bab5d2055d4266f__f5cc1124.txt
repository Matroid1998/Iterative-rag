Description:
A radioactive iodine isotope that contributes to pollution from nuclear and medical waste.

Text:
Iodine pollution from nuclear and medical waste (129I and 131I) is a problem for both 
humans and the environment due to its ability to accumulate in waterways, soil or in 
certain tissues, especially in the thyroid gland. Radioactive iodine is a major pollutant in 
nuclear accidents such as the Fukushima ,1 and Chernobyl nuclear power plant disasters 
as well as regular nuclear waste disposal from power generation facilities.24 In fact, after 
1986, thyroid cancer cases spiked tremendously among the people living in vicinity of 
the Chernobyl power plant.5 The biomagnification of radioactive iodine species among the 
local population, particularly children1, was determined to be the cause of disease 
proliferation.
