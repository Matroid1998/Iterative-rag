Description:
Used in rROP to introduce thioester linkages into polymer backbones.

Text:
b) 
rROP preparation of polyesters from cyclic ketene acetal (CKA) monomer (focus on 
homopolymerization and mentioning typical copolymerizations). c) rROP of thionolactones, 
as explored in the present work, to introduce thioester linkages into the polymer backbone 
(focus on typical copolymerizations). The challenge is to have the extra comonomer (green) 
incorporated in a regulated manner for a wide range of vinyl polymers. In the present work, we 
deal with the challenge to realize a methacrylaterich backbone (blue but extra methyl). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024vrnfz ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000253901553 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
