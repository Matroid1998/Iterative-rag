Description:
A carbon-free fuel suitable for transportation, storage, and consumption.

Text:
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology for converting solar 
photons to H2 fuel, which is carbonfree and suitable for transportation, storage, and 
consumption. The PEC reactions for water splitting are driven by successive processes such as 
light absorption, generation of electronhole pairs, separation of the generated charges and 
charge transfer to the electrolyte. In order to address each of these aspects, as well as to prevent 
(photo)chemical corrosion of the electrodes, the development of multilayered structures 
consisting of various functional layers is generally required (e.g. lightabsorbing 
semiconductors, selective contacts, protective layers, and catalysts).
