Description:
A nucleophilic component introduced as a C(sp2) anion equivalent impacting chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.

Text:
Owing to the wide range of oxidation states in which 
firstrow metals can exist, their reactivity towards radical 
intermediates allows them to forge bonds from easytoaccess 
radical precursors. For the sake of illustration, consider a gen
eral C(sp2)C(sp3) linkage. Following conventional retrosyn
thetic analysis along the lines of polar bond disconnections 
would lead to powerful crosscoupling tactics such as Suzuki, 
KumadaCorriu, Negishi, and Stille most often mediated by a 
palladium catalyst (Figure 1A).1820 In such cases, the nucleo
philic component is either introduced as a C(sp2) anion equiv
alent (organomagnesium, organozinc, organoboron, etc.) which can impact chemoselectivity and functional group com
patibility.
