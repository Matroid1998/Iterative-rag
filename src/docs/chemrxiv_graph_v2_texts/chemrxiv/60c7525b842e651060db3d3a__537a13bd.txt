Description:
Replaced by Chl a cofactors in PSI.

Text:
In PSI, the inner pair of cofactors is formed by Chl a
and its C132epimer (Chl a), which are called PB and PA, respectively. Similar to the
case of PSII, the pair of accessory PSI pigments is composed of Chl a molecules (denoted
as A1A and A1B), whereas pheophytins and plastoquinones are replaced by Chl a co
factors (A0A and A0B) and phylloquinones (A1A and A1B), respectively. In both PSI and
PSII, magnesium ions of innerpair Chls are coordinated by histidine (His) aminoacid
residues, whereas those of accessory pigments are coordinated by water molecules.
