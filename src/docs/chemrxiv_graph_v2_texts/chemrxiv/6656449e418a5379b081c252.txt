Description:
Important pH sensing residues.

Text:
A substantial range of helix tilt angles can be appreciated from these structures, 
which also demonstrate differences in the conformations of the important pH sensing histidine 
residues, the gating tryptophan, and for S31N M2, the asparagine that confers resistance to the 
drugs rimantadine and amantadine. Solidstate NMR has been put forward as a technique that can probe the structure of the protein in 
hydrated lipid bilayers, and as such, a method suitable to probe native protein structure. 14 Indeed, 
it is well established that the lipid environment can be crucial for obtaining the biologically 
relevant structure of the protein. 1,46 In oriented samples (OS), the spectrum is exquisitely sensitive 
to small changes in the tilt angle of alpha helices.
