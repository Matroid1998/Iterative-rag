Description:
A compound produced by females from a Canterbury population of Graphania mutans.

As such, the T. atristriga sex pheromone could be a 
46 
key tool in the future for the control of sudden or sporadic outbreaks of this pest. 47 
Surprisingly, New Zealand has a relatively small number of Noctuidae, with about 140 
48 
known species being endemic to the country and occurring nowhere else (Dugdale 1989). In 
49 
New Zealand, the sex pheromone has been identified for only one other noctuid species, 
50 
Graphania mutans (Walker) (Frrot and Foster 1991). Two distinct taxa within G. mutans 
51 
were found. Females from an Auckland population produced (Z)9tetradecenol (Z914OH), 
52 
(Z)9tetradecenyl acetate (Z914OAc), (Z)7tetradecenol (Z714OH) and (Z)7
53 
tetradecenyl acetate (Z714OAc), while females from a Canterbury population produced 
54 
these four compounds plus (Z)9tetradecenal (Z914Ald).
