In drug discovery, the 3D structure of proteins is crucial for the success of drugs. The increased use of 
sp3hybridized carbon atoms (Fsp3) is key, as it correlates with a drugs effectiveness and safety.1 This 
trend, known as Escape from Flatland,2 involves increasing Fsp3 in drugs for better alignment with 
protein structures, enhancing selectivity and efficacy.3 This strategy improves target interaction and 
reduces side effects, balancing effective treatment with minimal negative effects. Historically, classical crosscoupling reactions have been a linchpin in synthetic chemistry, enabling 
the straightforward construction of C(sp2)C(sp2) bonds and thereby propelling the production of 
planar, biaryl structures.
