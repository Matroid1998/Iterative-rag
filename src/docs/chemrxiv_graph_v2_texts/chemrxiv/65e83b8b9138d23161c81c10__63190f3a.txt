Description:
Known for the silicon effect, which enhances the reactivity and regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution in alkenes.

Text:
Organosilicon compounds play a crucial role in organic 
synthesis, serving as synthetic reagents, intermediates, pro
tecting groups, and valuable bioisosteres of carbon.18 
Among these compounds, allyl silanes encompass the prop
erties of alkenes and organometallic complexes, making 
them widely used in organic synthesis.912 Notably, the well
known silicon effect,11,13 which manifests itself in the se
lective electrophilic substitution of alkenes, is particularly 
pronounced in the reactivity of allyl silanes. This effect not 
only enhances the activity and nucleophilicity of alkenes, es
pecially the alkenyl carbons distal to the silyl group, but also 
effectively controls the regioselectivity through (CSi) 
hyperconjugation.

Description:
Susceptible to nucleophilic attack, leading to desilylation in allyl silanes.

Text:
However, the siliconeffectinduced 
functionalization of allyl silanes primarily targets unsatu
rated double bonds, resulting in double bond migration and 
extensive desilylation owing to the susceptibility of silicon 
groups to nucleophilic attack (left, Scheme 1a).9,10 While of
fering substantial promise for the synthesis of functional
ized organosilanes, direct allylic CH functionalization of al
lyl silanes enabled by silicon effects remain largely under
explored,14,15 probably due to its propensity to undergo 
transmetalation with transition metal CH activation cata
lysts, and the higher reactivity of the activated  system 
(right, Scheme 1a).
