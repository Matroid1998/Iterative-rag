2021 Foldamers have been used to recognize small molecules or biomacromolecules.2228 
Regulation of foldamer function through switching is feasible where folding is driven by co
operative noncovalent interactions; several stimuli have been used to switch between 
unfolded and folded forms29 including acidbase,30 cations,31 anions,3233 redox state34 
and light.35 Whilst single chain folded polymers have been reported,3637 the development 
of selfassembled foldamers is less explored.31, 3841 
Hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) have been widely used for supramolecular polymer 
assembly;4247 hydrogenbonds are reversible, directional, and, when combined into HBMs 
have tuneable associationdisassociation affinities.44, 4851 A number of light responsive 
hydrogenbond assembled supramolecular polymers have been described.5255 Notably, 
stilbene, dithienylethene and azobenzene photoswitches have been used to regulate 
assembly of selfcomplementary hydrogenbond assembled supramolecular polymers (i.e.
