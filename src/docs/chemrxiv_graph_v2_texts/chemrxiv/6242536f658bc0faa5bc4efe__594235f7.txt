Description:
Has an affinity towards fingermarks, possibly due to its polarizability in the presence of Lewis bases.

methods for visualising fingermarks typically function by forming a visible dye or fluorophore,1 
33 
although more recently this idea has been expanded to include ultraviolet and nearinfrared 
34 
emitting species.2 The Home Office Fingermark Visualisation Manual lists at least seven 
35 
Category A processes that rely on the chemical transformation of residues present within 
36 
fingermarks, or affinity of those residues towards certain chemical dyes.3 
37 
The affinity of iodine towards fingermarks is long known,4 and it features in two Category B 
38 
processes described in the Fingermark Visualisation Manual iodine fuming and iodine solution.3 
39 
The underlying cause of this affinity has been debated, with the polarizability of iodine in the 
40 
presence of Lewis bases thought to be the driving force behind the interaction.

Description:
Involved in transient, reversible interactions with alkene functional groups.

Transient, reversible 
41 
interactions between iodine and the alkene functional groups of squalene constitute one of the 
42 
likeliest candidates in the context of fingermark residues.5 
43 
Chemical fixing of iodine to overcome the drawbacks of transient development and poor contrast 
44 
provided by iodine alone has been achieved several ways, the most common being through its 
45 
encapsulation by starch,4,6 or by reaction with naphthoflavone (a.k.a. 7,8benzoflavone).7 The 
46 
chromophore from the latter fixing reaction has been previously reported as a gemiodo species 
47 
formed after substitution of the ketone group by iodine (vide infra),5b though this unpublished 
48 
report provided no supporting instrumental evidence for that assignment. 49 
Several studies have sought to optimise fingermark development methods based on combined 
50 
iodine and naphthoflavone sprays.
