Description:
A compound involved in the reaction without forming a ring-opened product.

of a vinyl group in the Ncarboxy leaving group (10) 
resulted in the formation of product 3da (73, 8317 er) and 2vinylbenzoic acid (11, 98) as a side 
product, with no observation of 12. This ruled out the intermediacy of a benzoyloxy radical. In the reaction 
of 13 bearing a cyclopropyl group at C2 of indole, no ring opened product 15 was observed, supporting 
the absence of indolederived radical involvement. Interestingly, incorporation of a 4pentenyl group in 
2naphthol resulted in a dearomatized indolylation product 17 (44, 8812 er), with no 5exotrig 
cyclization product 18 observed. In addition, the reaction of cyclopropyl2naphthol 19 gave 20, without 
the ringopened byproduct 21. These experiments helped clary the absence of C1 radicals from 2
naphthols in the catalytic cycle.

Description:
A moiety that undergoes fast aromatization.

Text:
Deuteriumlabeling experiments were then conducted to probe the ratedetermining stage (Figure 1D). The reaction of C3deuterated 1dd (97D) under standard conditions provided 3da with no Datom 
incorporation (Eq. 2). Additionally, there was no difference in the rate of formation of 3da when 1dd 
was exchanged for 1d (refer to the graph below Eqs. 13). This observation suggested that aromatization 
of the indole moiety is fast. In sharp contrast, when 2ad (97D) replaced 2a (Eq.

3), the rate of the 
formation of 3da slowed down substantially (green square), but the rate of disappearance of 1d remained 
the same.14 In fact, in the reaction with 2ad, we observed a reaction intermediate (Int, purple triangle) 
in the crude 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S15).14 This species had a broad singlet at 8.32 ppm (NH of 
indole) and two doublets (J  9.9 Hz) at 6.48 and 7.68 ppm (corresponding to  and protons,
