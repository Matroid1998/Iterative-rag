Description:
Forms hydrogen bonding interactions in a Watson-Crick pair, stabilizing the DNA double helix.

To understand the carcinogenic effects upon absorption of UV radiation on DNA, it is very
important to study the UVinduced photophysics and photochemistry of DNA nucleic acid
bases (NABs). NABs are the important constituents of life. The hydrogen bonding interac
tion between NABs such as adeninethymine (AT) and guaninecytosine (GC) in a Watson
Crick pair is the central of its stabilization along with the DNA double helix.24 People have
extensively studied the photoprocesses and the nonradiative deactivation mechanism of
DNA bases experimentally as well as computationally.510
Over the last few decades, there has been significant effort towards expanding the genetic
alphabet.
