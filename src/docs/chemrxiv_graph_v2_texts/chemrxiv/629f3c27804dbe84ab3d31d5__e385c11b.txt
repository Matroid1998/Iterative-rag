Description:
Formed by the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms or by reaction with a solvated proton.

The process of the catalytic HER is often regarded as the VolmerTafel and the VolmerHeyrovsky 
mechanism. Both mechanisms involve electrochemical hydrogen adsorption, hydrogen atoms were 
adsorbed on active atoms of the catalyst to form adsorbed H Volmer reaction (Equation 1), then 
followed by the combination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms to produce H2 molecule Tafel 
reaction (Equation 2) or the reaction between one adsorbed hydrogen and a solvated proton from the 
water layer to form a H2 molecule Heyrovsky reaction (Equation 3).1

MHads signifies a H atom adsorbed on the surfaceactive atoms of the catalysts.
