Description:
A privileged scaffold used in the stereoselective preparation of valuable compounds.

Nowadays, cascade reactions (or domino reactions)1 represent 
a formidable challenge for modern synthetic chemistry.2 Those 
reactions are generally described as multicomponent onepot 
processes involving two or more transformations. That 
strategy offers many advantages over classical stopandgo 
sequences, for example, in avoiding protecting groups or 
isolation of reaction intermediates. Besides operational 
efficiency (step and pot economy),3 organocascade reactions 
showed significant advantages for constructing complex 
molecular frameworks with high selectivity levels (stereo, 
chemo). Not surprisingly, organocascade reactions were 
successfully used for the stereoselective preparation of 
valuable spirocycliclic compounds,4 for example, the 
privileged 
scaffold 
 spirocyclic 
oxindole 
derivatives 
(spirooxindoles).5 Spirooxindole structural motif appears as a 
part of various natural or synthetic compounds with 
remarkable biological activity, including medicinally relevant 
compounds (Figure 1).6
