Description:
Coordinates a two iron-two sulfur cluster in NEET proteins and binds iron closer to the protein surface.

Text:
The human NEET ironsulfur proteins (mNT, NAF1, MiNT)13 play a key role in mitochondrial 
dysfunction associated with diseases, such as metabolic diseases, cancers, and progressive 
neurodegeneration diseases4, 5. While MiNT is a monomeric protein located inside the 
mitochondria4, the other two are homodimers localized on the outer membrane of mitochondria 
with a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic domain. Each subunit features a two irontwo sulfur 
cluster coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine. The histidinebound iron is closer to the 
protein surface, which can exist as an Fe(II) or an Fe(III) ion, while the other metal (an Fe(III) ion) 
is buried in the protein (Chart I in SI).
