Description:
A supporting salt in electrolyte systems.

Previous theoretical studies (e.g., DFT) focused on the decomposition pathways of main 
electrolyte species i.e., the ethylene carbonate solvent and the supporting salt lithium 
hexafluorophosphate, LiPF6. However, due to computational cost, DFT is restricted to very 
short time scales and cannot model large, nonperiodic systems. So, cheaper computational 
methods are essential to model reactions in amorphous systems like the SEI1,2. Reactive forcefield methods were used to study electrolyte decomposition reactions (e.g., 1,3
dioxolane7) and extend the simulation time. However, these reactive force fields are plagued by 
a difficulty of transferability they are usually built and optimized for a specific set of reactions 
(e.g., the decomposition of ethylene carbonate only) and need to be reparameterized for each 
new composition of the system810.
