Under humid or aqueous conditions, interfacial water molecules are ubiquitous in nature and 
33 
technology. The solidliquid interface is vital in countless physical, chemical, or biological 
34 
processes and applications14. One important factor to understand the structural properties 
35 
of interfacial water is the hydrogen bond network at the interface, which is notoriously 
36 
difficult to probe1,3. Recent studies revealed an exciting way to study the interfacial hydrogen 
37 
network within MOFs5,6 and graphene capillaries7 via atmospheric water capture (AWC)810. 38 
It is now appealing to further broaden the use of this methodology. Firstly, extend AWC 
39 
beyond the specific case of MOFs or the perfect graphene plane as the solid adsorbent. These 
40 
materials consider special cases which have few technological and natural analogues.

Description:
Investigating the interfacial hydrogen network in functionalised carbon under the presence of cations is highly desirable.

Text:
In 
41 
contrast, functionalised carbon in humid or aqueous environments are ubiquitous and thus 
42 
relevant in many systems. For example, the hydrophilic groups in lipid bilayers or DNA 
43 
strands11,12 as well as in hydrophilic polymer membranes13,14, graphene oxide (GO)based 
44 
membranes1519 or single atom catalysts20,21 all obtain carbonoxygen interfaces with water. 45 
All these examples exist in aqueous environments that contain cations. However, there is lack 
46 
of studies looking at the carbonoxygen interface with water in the presence of cations 
47 
despite its enormous fundamental and technological relevance. Hence, conceiving an AWC 
48 
study that can investigate the interfacial hydrogen network in functionalised carbon under 
49 
the presence of cations is highly desirable.

Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds with water molecules, enriching the hydrogen bond network.

Text:
The most 
59 
recent water transport study highlighted that intercalated cation on GO surface causes 
60 
controllable friction with water molecules via hydrogen bondings16. The observations suggest 
61 
that intercalated cations may enrich the hydrogen bond network of water molecules on GO
