Description:
Components of lipids that are essential for refining lipid models.

Text:
New experimental measurements have also become 
available recently for lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and should be considered for 
guiding the refinement of their respective models (e.g. D thickness for SDPC and PDPC)22.
