Description:
Involved in lithiation-trapping sequences in flow chemistry.

Text:
In addition to aryllithium chemistry,
flash flow chemistry may be successfully applied to chemistry involving carbenoids6 and saturated metalated
heterocycles7. A number of excellent reviews covering many of these aspects of flash flow chemistry in
greater detail have been published 8, 9. Scheme 1 The lithiationtrapping sequence discussed in this work. By adapting a generalpurpose reactor design disclosed by Sedelmeier for use in our laboratories10, 11 and
using the conditions in Scheme 1, we have had considerable success running lithiationelectrophile trapping
sequences in flow across a variety of synthetic and medicinal chemistry projects, enabling access to building
blocks whose syntheses are impractical under batch conditions.
