Description:
Involved in atom-diatom reactions with I.

Text:
Resonances spanning the transition state region have been identified for the atomdiatom reactions I  HI 
and F  H2,2021 while entrance22 and exit23 channel resonances have been characterized for the F  CH4 and 
F  CH3OH reactions, respectively. Dynamical resonances  quasibound states along the reaction pathway 
lying high in energy than the reactant asymptote  have been shown to strongly influence reactivity and 
dynamics.24 
Here, we present a joint photoelectron imaging and quantum dynamics study of the F  NH3  HF  NH2 
hydrogenabstraction reaction, based on highresolution photodetachment of the FNH3 anion. The F  
NH3 reaction is highly exoergic (10422 cm1), and an accurate global PES (Fig.
