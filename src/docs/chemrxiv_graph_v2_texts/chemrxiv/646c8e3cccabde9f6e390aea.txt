Description:
Highly toxic compounds produced through photolytic degradation of TCS.

Text:
Here, TCS and its 
degradation product methyltriclosan, formed during the wastewater treatment process, may 
accumulate in terrestrial organisms like earthworms.18 Other relevant degradation products 
include highly toxic chlorinated dioxins and chlorophenols, which are produced through 
photolytic degradation of TCS.5,19 
Starting with the work of McAvoy et al.,10 several authors have measured TCS concentrations 
in WWTP influents and effluents, and the results have been compiled in review articles3,12 and
