research trend, therefore, aims at rendering Liion technology more sustainable. This can
obviously be done by replacing critical materials with less critical ones, as is reected in the
trend towards Co and Nifree LFP cathodes21 or in the substitution of natural graphite by
the synthetic equivalent.22 Also performance enhancement of current technology may de
crease the materials exploitation, for example by increasing the cycle life of the battery or
by elevating the energy that can be stored in a certain amount of material. A completely
dierent but recently strongly pronounced idea is the substitution of Li as the shuttle ion. 1
