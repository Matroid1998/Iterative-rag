Description:
Involved in the oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by perovskite oxides.

Text:
Perovskite oxides have been studied as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for decades due 
to their high activity and use of relatively abundant transition metals1. Early reports to rationalize the 
activity of these catalysts made use of activity correlations with bulk thermodynamic concepts such as lower 
to higher enthalpy of oxidation and delectron count on the Bsite metal cation2. More recently, descriptors 
such as the extent of transition metaloxygen hybridization (covalency)3, O2p band position band position 
relative to the Fermi energy4, and eg electron count of the transition metal cation5 have been used to connect 
the activity of perovskite oxides to their electronic structures.
