Description:
Interacts with dehydroxylated SiO2 involving ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl groups.

Text:
They found that the amount of hydrogen in amino (NHx) groups increased with the 
number of reaction cycles on both alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) substrates, suggesting that 
more NHx groups were formed on the Al2O3 and SiO2 surfaces as the reactions progressed. The 
interaction of TMA with dehydroxylated SiO2 involved ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl (
OH) groups and dissociation in siloxane (SiOSi) bridges, leading to surface saturation with 
methyl (CH3) groups, followed by the replacement of these CH3 groups by NHx groups upon 
reaction with NH3, indicating a stepwise transformation of the surface chemistry.

Description:
Generates SiCH3 groups on silica upon reaction.

Text:
Additionally, 
upon reacting with silica, TMA generated SiCH3 groups on the surface, and the subsequent 
interaction with NH3, particularly at higher temperatures, led to the removal of over 90  of the 
initial CH3 groups, which aligned with the proposed reaction pathway for this process. A recent modelling study of the surface reconstruction after the NH3 pulse in ALD of AlN, GaN 
and InN,11 suggests that, at typical ALD temperatures and pressures, the AlN surface is 
predominantly covered by NH2 species at thermal equilibrium. The surface chemistry of TMA
