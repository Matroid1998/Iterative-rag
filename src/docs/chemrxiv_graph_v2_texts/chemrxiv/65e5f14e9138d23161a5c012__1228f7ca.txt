Description:
Exhibits photocatalytic activity due to photoinduced electron transfer from the HOMO orbitals of the ligand to the LUMO orbitals on Titaniumoxo clusters.

Text:
The photocatalytic 
activity of the MIL125(Ti) is due to a photoinduced electron transfer from the HOMO orbitals of the 
ligand into the LUMO orbitals localized on the Titaniumoxo clusters. The incorporation of amino (
NH2) group in some of the ligand is shifting the absorption wavelength of the MOF to the visible 
spectral range and favour the stabilisation of the electronhole pair, as it has been shown by transient 
UVvis and MidIR femtosecond spectroscopy18,19. For MIL125 derivatives, and MOFs in general, 
understanding the crucial influence on the ligand substituent on the photocatalytic activity18,2024 is of 
great importance to optimize the applications.

Description:
A microporous photocatalyst involved in electron-hole formation and reactivity.

Text:
Interestingly, by comparing the effect of 
triethanolamine (TEOA) and of methanol (MeOH) as hole scavengers for the photocatalytic HER 
process with MIL125(Ti) and NH2MIL125(Ti), Eder and coworkers22 have shown that the charge 
stabilization on the amino group is not favourable to the hole scavenging by MeOH, while TEOA 
molecules degrade the MIL125(Ti). These works illustrate the complex interplay between the 
different and often competitive primary photophysical and photochemical processes governing the 
electronhole formation and reactivity in microporous photocatalysts. The properties of the excited 
states, the mode of energy transfer and of charge separation toward the metal centre vary finely with 
the nature and composition of the porous materials.
