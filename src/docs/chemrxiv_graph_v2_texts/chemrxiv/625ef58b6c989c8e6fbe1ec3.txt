Description:
Present in hemoglobin in its ferrous state (Fe2) and in methemoglobin in its ferric state (Fe3).

Text:
Oxygen 
93 
bound to Hb is referred to as oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) while Hb without oxygen is referred to as 
94 
deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) 17. In vivo, every day roughly 3 of oxyHb is autoxidized to methemoglobin 
95 
(metHb), a derivative incapable of binding and carrying oxygen 1,18. In healthy Hb, such as oxyHb and 
96 
deoxyHb, iron is present in its ferrous state (Fe2), compared to the oxidized metHb in which iron is 
97 
present in its ferric state (Fe3) 1,7,17. In vivo, internal reduction mechanisms including enzymes 
98 
glutathione peroxidase and methemoglobin reductase are responsible for maintaining low levels of 
99 
metHb by converting Hb to its healthy derivatives (1,19).

Description:
In hemoglobin derivatives, it binds a distal histidine residue rather than oxygen or water.

Text:
Ex vivo, when blood is deposited, the 
100 
combination of environmental stressors and loss of the internal reduction mechanisms lead to the 
101 
accelerated oxidative changes in Hb derivatives 1,7,18. Continued degradation creates further 
102 
conformational changes to the structure of Hb, leading to the formation of hemichromes (HCs) 17. The 
103 
iron in this Hb derivative binds a distal histidine residue rather than oxygen or water 1,7. This ex vivo
