Description:
Used as n-dopants in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for MR TADF emitters.

Text:
First reported by Hatakeyama et al., 
these compounds are p and ndoped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).9 By 
employing this approach, the singlet and triplet excited states possess an alternating 
pattern of increasing and decreasing electron density compared to the ground state, thus 
enabling a small exchange integral and consequently a small EST.10 The rigid structure 
and the short range charge transfer (SRCT) nature of the excited states endow the MR
TADF compounds with bright, narrowband emission. Since the first report of MR
TADF emitters used in OLEDs in 2016 there has been intense research focused on 
expanding the chemical space encompassed by class of emitters.11 In the original works 
of Hatakeyama, the ndopants were boron atoms.
