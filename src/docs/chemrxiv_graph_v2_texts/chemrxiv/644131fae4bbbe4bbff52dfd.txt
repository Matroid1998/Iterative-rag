Description:
Measured as total or dissolved organic carbon (TOC, DOC) in drinking water monitoring.

In fact, NOM can interact with residual disinfectant, favoring the production 
49 
of toxic disinfection byproducts.3 NOM can also affect contaminants kinetics within the network4 
50 
and can also interact with the metallic materials of the pipes, eventually aiding their release.5 In 
51 
addition, NOM can cause biological instability supporting microbial growth in drinking water 
52 
distribution networks (DWDNs),6 favoring the development of biofilm, possibly resulting in pipe 
53 
biocorrosion and offering a favorable habitat for pathogens.7 
54 
Due to its heterogeneity and complexity, several techniques are required to fully characterize NOM. 55 
Commonly, in the field of drinking water monitoring, NOM is measured through the estimation of 
56 
total or dissolved organic carbon (TOC, DOC). However, such measurement provides only a
