Description:
Undergo ring-opening reactions at varying distances from a pendant silanol tether.

Text:
Our laboratory has a program of 
developing cyclization technology using the di
tertbutyl silanol auxiliary (Scheme 1A).18 We 
have recently investigated the ringopening of 
epoxides at varying distances from the pendant 
silanol tether.5 When the epoxide is located at 
carbons 4 and 5 relative to the silanol, silanoxy
tetrahydrofurans form from a tandem SN2 attack 
and silyl shift. We term this a 5,5mechanism, 
so named for the ring sizes involved in each step. As part of this line of inquiry, we wished to 
investigate a related reaction with aziridines 
bearing remote silanols.
