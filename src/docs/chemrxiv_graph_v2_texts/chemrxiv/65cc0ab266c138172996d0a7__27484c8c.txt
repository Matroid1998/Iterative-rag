63 
2e ORR, however, available electrocatalysts for 2e ORR suffer from limited activity 
64 
and selectivity, hindering widespread commercial adoption. Thus, finding a high
65 
performance electrocatalyst for 2e ORR is crucial as an alternative to the Riedl
66 
Pfleiderer method. 67 
Essentially, H2O2 is partially produced from O2 through the ORR process on the 
68 
cathode. O2 activation relies on metal site backdonation; higher backdonation yields 
69 
two adsorbed oxygen, while lower levels fail to activate O2. Hence, optimizing back
70 
donation of metal site is crucial for catalyst design to enhance H2O2 performance.
