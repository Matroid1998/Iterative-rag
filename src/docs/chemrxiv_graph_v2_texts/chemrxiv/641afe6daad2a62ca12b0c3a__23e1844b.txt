Description:
A type of glass used as a substrate for ITO films in laser patterning processes.

Text:
Laser Digital Patterning (LDP)15 and Pulsed Laser Deposition 
(PLD)16 processes for fabrication of ITO electrodes are examples of these kind. A nanosecond Nd YAG infrared laser for indirect 
laser ablation to pattern ITO on its glass substrate was reported17. Another interesting example is the pattern formation on ITO films 
coated on borosilicate glass by scanning a linearly polarized nanosecond pulsed laser beam, making use of a selforganization 
phenomenon named laserinduced periodic surface structures (LIPSS)18. Apart from these examples, there are other reports on laser 
patterning of ITO using other lasers, such as an UVexcimer laser and femtosecondpulsed laser19, but none of these gives the 
advantage of being widely available and preferably affordable means of fabrication of microelectrodes.
