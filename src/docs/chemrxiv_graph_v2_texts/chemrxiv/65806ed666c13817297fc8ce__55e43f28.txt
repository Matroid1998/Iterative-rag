Description:
Faces challenges in transportation and storage due to the risk of explosion.

More specifically, the 
hydrogenation route is limited by the requirements of pressurized H2 gas, strong acidic 
conditions, as well as precious metal catalysts. Moreover, transportation and storage of 
concentrated NH2OH also faces challenges, including the risk of explosion.7 On the other hand, 
NH3 oxidation utilizes NH2OH generated insitu as needed.4 Yet, this synthetic route still 
demands elevated temperatures, high pH, and an excess of H2O2 as oxidant, which also has 
transportation and storage issues.8, 9 Hence, there is a strong desire for an alternative strategy 
to produce cyclohexanone oxime under mild conditions.
