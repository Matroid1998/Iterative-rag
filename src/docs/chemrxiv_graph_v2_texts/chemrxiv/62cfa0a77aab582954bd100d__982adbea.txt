through 
photocatalysis.5 This is an ideal environmental pollution control 
and clean energy production technology due to mild reaction 
conditions, green and lowcarbon products. If these reactions can 
achieve scale production, it can largely alleviate the energy crisis 
and environmental pollution.6 
The photocatalytic reaction is a chemical reaction caused by 
the light absorption of the photocatalyst. Structural stability, 
catalytic activity and reaction selectivity are important indicators 
for the investigation of a photocatalyst.7 Polyoxometalates 
(POMs) are metal oxygen clusters formed by connecting some 
high oxidation valence early transition metals with oxygen atoms.

Description:
Materials used in photocatalysis.

Text:
To use bibliometric methods to investigate the 
knowledge structure of POMbased materials in photocatalysis, it 
is necessary to collect and collate relevant literature and extract 
key information for analysis (such as authors, countries, 
institutions, and keywords).20 
2.1. Data collection 
To ensure the comprehensiveness and authority of the 
relevant literature, the scientific publication of POMbased 
materials in photocatalysis is retrieved from the SCIExpanded in 
the Web of Science (Wos) Core Collection. The database 
contains highquality literature information in many research fields 
such as natural science and engineering technology.2122 In this 
work, we collect relevant literature through topic retrieval. The 
retrieval formula is as follows (TS(polyoxometalate OR 
polyoxometalates OR polyoxometalates oxygen cluster OR 
metaloxo 
cluster 
OR 
metaloxygen 
cluster) 
AND 
TS(photocatalytic OR photocatalysis OR photocatalyst OR 
lightdriven catalyst)).
