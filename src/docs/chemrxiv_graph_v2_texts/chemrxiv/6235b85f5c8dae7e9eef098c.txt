Description:
The growth morphology is affected by changing the solvent from water to isopropanol.

Text:
The growth of crystals from solution is inherently af
fected by interactions of solute molecules with the sol
vent. These interactions modulate the facespecic
growth rates leading to the emergence of solventspecic
crystal morphologies.16 Understanding how surface
solvent interactions change the morphology at a molecu
lar level is key to the development of rational approaches
for the design of crystallization processes. Examples of solutioncontrolled crystal morphology
alterations have long been of research interest, resulting
in an abundance of publications reporting such obser
vations. A landmark paper on the subject by Davey
et al.7 came out almost four decades ago, looking into
the growth morphology of succinic acid upon changing
the solvent from water to isopropanol.
