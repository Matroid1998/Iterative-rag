Description:
Salts uniquely positioned to effect mild and efficient access to arynes.

Text:
For instance, cyclic dia
rylhalonium salts specifically deliver biarylderived arynes 
and therefore lack broad generality.9,10,19,23 Additionally, 
triaryloxonium salts require a substantial time and materi
al investment to synthesize similar to that of o
trimethylsilylaryl 
triflates.13 
Unsymmetrical 
ar
yl(Mes)iodonium and aryl thianthrenium salts are unique
ly positioned within this class of aryne precursors to effect 
both mild and efficient access to arynes (Scheme 1b). Simple arenes are unconventional aryne precursors be
cause they lack complimentary electrofugal and nucleo
fugal leaving groups for a redox neutral elimination event. Yet, the dehydrogenation of simple arenes represents an 
expansive source of latent aryne intermediates and even 
has the potential for latestage functionalization of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients and agrochemicals.

Description:
Salts that are more easily accessed than aryl(Mes)iodonium salts and used as aryne precursors.

Text:
In 2023 we 
merged the CH functionalization of arenes via thi
anthrenation and deprotonative aryne generation for a net 
dehydrogenation of simple arenes as an efficient way to 
access arynes (Scheme 1c).11 In our early optimization, we 
found that aryl thianthrenium salts were more easily ac
cessed than aryl(Mes)iodonium salts and we therefore 
developed a twostep sequence in which the aryl thi
anthrenium salts were isolated and subsequently used as 
aryne precursors (Scheme 1c). Although the isolation of
