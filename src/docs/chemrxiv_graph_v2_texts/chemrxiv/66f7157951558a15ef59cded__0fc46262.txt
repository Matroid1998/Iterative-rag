Description:
A derivative used in macromonomers for creating photocurable networks.

Text:
The rate of degradation is intricately linked to 
various factors such as chemical structure of the material, number and type of functional groups 
as well as its hydrophilicity 1214. Skrobot et. al. presented degradation profile of a various 
macromonomers based on fatty acid derivative comprising ester, anhydride and urethane 
groups. These served for creating photocurable networks featuring diverse architectures of
