Description:
A solvent in which the metastable Z-isomer of azobenzene has a half-life of 2 days at room temperature.

Text:
Azobenzene requires ultraviolet light 
(320 nm) to promote the E  Z isomerization, limiting its utility in vivo due to undesired light
promoted dimerizations, destruction of living tissue from UVlight, and low light penetrability in 
living tissue.11, 2223 Further, the metastable Zisomer thermally reverts to the E isomer and has a 
halflife (t12) of 2 days at room temperature in acetonitrile. This relatively short halflife results in 
an unstable photostationary state (PSS), thus limiting photoswitch efficacy where bistability is 
neded.8 As such, an ideal photoswitch features a longlived t12 (e.g., weeks to months), an Eisomer 

1 
max in the visible range, and wellseparated max values for the E and Z isomers to prevent bimodal 
isomerization. Scheme 1. The azobenzene photoswitch reaction.
