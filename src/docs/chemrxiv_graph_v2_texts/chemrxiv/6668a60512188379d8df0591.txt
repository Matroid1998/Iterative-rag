Description:
A neurotransmitter involved in coordinating movement.

Text:
Parkinsons disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects 
movement. 13 It is characterized by the gradual loss of dopamineproducing neurons in the 
brain, particularly in a region called the substantia nigra. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter 
involved in coordinating movement, and its deficiency leads to the characteristic motor 
symptoms of Parkinsons disease, including tremors, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), 
muscle rigidity, and postural instability. 4 Additionally, Parkinsons disease can cause a range of 
nonmotor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances. 5 
While the exact cause of Parkinsons disease is not fully understood, it is believed to involve a 
combination of genetic, environmental, and agerelated factors.
