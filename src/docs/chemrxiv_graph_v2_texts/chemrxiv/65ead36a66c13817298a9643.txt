Description:
Common pharmacophoric molecules synthesized using biocatalysis to access novel chemical space.

Text:
The approach taken in FBDD involves identifying small 
molecules that weakly bind to targets, which can then be synthetically elaborated into more complex, 
druglike molecules.2124 Some of the key properties highlighted as important for fragments by Murray 
and Rees include diverse polar groups and multiple synthetically accessible vectors for fragment 
growth.21 Due to the highly selective nature of biocatalysts (chemo, stereo, regio), polyfunctional 
fragments are more easily accessed than protectinggroup dependent synthetic approaches, thus 
affording fragments which potentially allow access to new chemical space (Figure 1). Our specific 
approach described herein aims to develop routes to common pharmacophoric molecules, namely 
anilines, by using biocatalysis to improve their synthesis, and give access to this potentially novel 
chemical space. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024v4hfn ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000195417201 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.
