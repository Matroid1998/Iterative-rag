In the context of the global climate crisis, the development of efficient carbon capture materials is
34
gaining urgency. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the main contributor to increasing atmospheric
35
greenhouse gas concentrations, directly resulting in threatening global temperature rises.1 In order to
36
limit global warming to 1.5C both vast emissions reductions and negative emission technologies are
37
now required.2 Carbon capture and storage is positioned to play a central roll in both transitioning
38
to zerocarbon energy sources and as a direct carbon dioxide removal technology to counterbalance
39
residual greenhouse gas emissions. The development of new materials, particularly for direct air
40
capture (DAC), is one of the key areas of research required for achieving economical technological
41
scaleup.
