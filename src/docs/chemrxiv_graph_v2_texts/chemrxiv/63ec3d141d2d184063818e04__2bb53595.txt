Description:
Involved in metathesis reactions, though remains a virtually untapped area.

The 
reaction development witnesses the evolution from an initial PaternBchi type 
oxetane synthesisfragmentation approach,
14 to a subsequent metal alkylidene
mediated scheme,
15,16 and eventually to a Lewis acid or organocatalysis strategy. 1724 In this synthetic scenario, the metal alkylidene complex is not catalytically 
competent due to the intrinsically limited electronic tunability of CO  bond and 
low reactivity of the intermediately formed MO bond; the Lewis acid and 
organocatalysis frequently rely on thermodynamically favored ring strain release 
(reactant) or ring structure formation (product) as a driving force completing a 
reaction. In contrast to the olefincarbonyl metathesis, olefinimine metathesis 
remains a virtually untapped area and only one stoichiometric metal alkylidene
