Description:
A compound involved in Merck's synthetic routes for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Text:
The efficient synthesis of chiral compounds is a key requirement for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs).1 Enzymes have a unique advantage over conventional chemistries, due to their innate 
high stereo, regio, and chemoselectivities, and have emerged as a powerful tool in synthetic routes, as 
highlighted by recent examples from industry such as Mercks routes to islatravir2 and nemtabrutinib,3 
Pfizers route to abrocitinib,4 or GSKs route to GSK2879552.5 Many enzymatic classes have been 
employed in the synthesis of chiral alcohols and amines (Figure 1A),6 two key functional groups in many 
APIs; however, the same is not true for other important functional groups, such as thiols and thioethers 
(Figure 1B).
