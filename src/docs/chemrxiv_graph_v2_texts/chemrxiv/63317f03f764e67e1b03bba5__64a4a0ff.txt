Description:
Participates in the grain growth process of CuO, leading to larger particle size and higher band gap.

Text:
A band gap increase by Ni and Mn doping has been reported Basith, Gulen. If Ni while 
doping is not in pure form and forms oxide which has a high band gap, the doped 
material shows a much higher band gap than 1.2 eV. However metals which remain in 
their pure form will cause a decrease in band gap as doping will cause a formation of 
energy level lower than CB or higher than VB. NiO also takes part in the grain growth process of CuO leading to larger particle size 
giving higher band gap. The presence of lattice defects like Cu 1 and O vacancies also 
affect the band gap Hong. 2. EXPERIMENTAL
