Ubiquitous structural motifs present in many biologically active molecules and building blocks for organic synthesis.

Text:
Vicinal aminoalcohols are ubiquitous structural motifs present in many biologically active 
molecules as well as building blocks for organic synthesis (Figure 1A). In fact, more than one 
million compounds that are unsubstituted at C1 and bear C2 substitution can be found in Reaxys, 
including 88 approved drugs and 3600 natural products (for example compounds 17).
