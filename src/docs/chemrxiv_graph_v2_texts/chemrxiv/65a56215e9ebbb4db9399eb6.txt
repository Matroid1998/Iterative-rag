Isoprenoids, comprising a vast family of natural products, are key metabolic components of all 
organisms.1 They are derived from the fivecarbon isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP) 
and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which are biosynthesised in Nature via two pathways, namely 
the 2methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and the mevalonate pathways.25 The precursors of IDP and 
DMADP are pyruvate and Dglyceraldehyde 3phosphate (GAP) in the MEP pathway (Figure 1a), but 
solely acetyl coenzyme A in the mevalonate pathway.
