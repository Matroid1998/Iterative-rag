Present in fractions that contribute to air pollution.

While it is known that air pollutants are mostly driven by emission from a diversity of sources, such as traffic (Colvile et al.,
2001), residential (Bari et al., 2011) and industrial combustion (Bing Chen and Zhang, 2011) there is also a significant con

tribution driven by local and global meteorological factors such as temperature (Hassan et al., 2020), wind (Munir et al.,
2017), pressure and humidity (Speranza and Caggiano, 2023) for, e.g., PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic
diameters 10 m and 2.5 m, respectively) but also for pollutants such as NO2 and carbon fractions (imic et al., 2020).
