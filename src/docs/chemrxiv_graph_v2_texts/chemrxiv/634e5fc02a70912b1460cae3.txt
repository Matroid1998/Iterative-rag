Description:
A pollutant that can be converted into value-adding carbon-based products through electrocatalytic reduction.

The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 offers a sustainable and efcient approach to produce carbon
chemicals, which are traditionally produced via fossil fuels.1 The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR)
provides a pathway to convert CO2 in the atmosphere from a pollutant into valueadding carbon
based products in the form of chemicals, fuels and feedstock, using surplus renewable energy.26
Common products of the CO2RR are carbon monoxide (CO), formate (HCOO), and methanol
(CH3OH), which is in competition with H2 production from the parasitic hydrogen evolution reac
tion (HER).1,7,8 The most interesting catalyst for the CO2RR today is Cu, as it produces a range
of valuable multicarbon (C2) products, such as ethylene (C2H4) and ethanol (C2H5OH).911 Ag
and nickel oxygenatederived catalysts have recently both been shown capable of producing C2
products,12,13 although at much lower formation rates than seen on Cu.
