Description:
Biomolecules analyzed using MALDI MS.

Text:
MALDI MS has been widely used in the analysis of biomolecules including nucleic acids, 
peptides, proteins and oligosaccharides. However, after more than 20 years of research, 
the mechanism of gas phase ion formation in the process of MALDI is still under debate.1
9 In most of models proposed in the literature, free ions in the plume were assumed before 
the application of the ion extraction potential, which implies or gives the impression of an 
overall charge unbalanced plume.2 In this article, the ion pair thermal model is presented. Key assumptions of the model include thermal desorption and ionization, strong tendency 
to gas phase neutralization, ion pair formation, overall charge balanced plume and 
thermal equilibrium.
