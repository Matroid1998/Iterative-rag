Description:
Forms anions in imidazolium-based ionic liquid mixtures.

Text:
Hydrogen bonding has been shown to have a strong inu
ence on the mixing behaviour. Herrera et al. investigated
imidazoliumbased IL mixtures with amino acid anions and
found both, negative as well as positive enthalpies of mix
ing. These observations were attributed to different hydrogen
bonded structures.44 Docampo Alarez et al. have mixed
protic and aprotic ILs and could show that all of these mix
