Description:
Functionalized in sorbents due to its strong affinity for mercury and used in low-cost polymers for heavy metal remediation.

Text:
To meet this need, a number 
52 
of sorbent technologies have been evaluated including activated carbon, biochar, zeolites, 
53 
polymers, metal covalent frameworks, and many other nanostructured or functionalised 
54 
materials.5 Among the many classes of mercury sorbents, those functionalised with sulfur are 
55 
of particular interest due to the strong affinity of sulfur for mercury.6 It is perhaps not surprising 
56 
that there have been many studies on sulfurfunctionalised sorbents for mercury remediation.7, 
57 
8 Among these materials, those sorbents made directly from sulfur are of particular interest, 
58 
due to the low cost and industrial surplus of elemental sulfur.7, 9 Additionally, there has been a 
59 
resurgence in methods to make polymers from sulfur,1014 which has created many opportunities 
60 
for using these lowcost and scalable polymers in mercury and heavy metal remediation.7, 1526 
61 
In this study, we investigated one of these sulfur polymers made by direct 
62 
copolymerisation of elemental sulfur with the renewable terpene limonene.

Description:
A low-cost, highly abundant feedstock produced by the petroleum industry.

Text:
Our lab first 
63 
reported the synthesis and use of this material in mercury remediation in 2015,27, 28 describing 
64 
its advantageous features. For instance, both sulfur and limonene are lowcost, highly abundant 
65 
feedstocks produced by the petroleum and citrus industries, respectively.
