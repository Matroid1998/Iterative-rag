Description:
An anatase catalyst used in selective catalytic reduction reactions to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.

Text:
Typical commercial metal oxide catalysts extensively applied in the industry usually consist
of a catalytic layer on a support. The catalytic performance of the oxide layer can be
further improved by mixing a certain portion of guest elements into the host oxide through
doping, which leads to changes in the electronic structures and chemical bonds within the
catalyst.1 One of the most widely employed dopants in commercial catalysts for the selective
catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction to reduce nitrogen oxide emission is tungsten, as realized
in WO3V2O5TiO2 (anatase).2,3 The role of tungsten doping in improving the catalytic
performance is still controversially discussed. Based on spectroscopy experiments, Peng et
al.
