Description:
Used in cyclodimerization reactions.

Text:
This ECPA was involved in catalysis study 
of N,Ndialkylimidazolium dimethyl phosphates 7, in synthesis and study of 
antimicrobial activity of some cyanoacrylates 8, as well as in synthesis of 
antiproliferative active 2aminobenzimidazole derivatives 9. 2Bromo ringsubstituted 
ECPA is reported in heterocyclic synthesis of novel antimicrobial agents 10, 
norepinephrine transporter imaging agents 11, as well as, in synthesis and anti
inflammatory activity of N and Salkylated arylidenethioxoimidazolidinones 12. 2
Bromo and 4bromo isopropyl cyanophenylacrylate (ICPA) was used in organocatalyzed 
enantioselective synthesis 13, 14, as well, in cyclodimerization of 1,1dicyanoalkenes 
and arylidenecyanoacetates 15. 3Bromo ICPA is reported in reductive dimerization
