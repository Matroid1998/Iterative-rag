Participates in base-catalyzed cyclocondensation with 2,6dihalobenzaldehydes and thiourea.

Text:
2,6Difluoro ringdisubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate was reported in basecatalyzed 
cyclocondensation of 2,6dihalobenzaldehydes, ethyl cyanoacetate, and thiourea 1. There 
are citations of difluorophenyl functional group organic reactions, i.e. 1ethenyl3,5
difluorobenzene in nickelcatalyzed reductive crosscoupling of aryl bromides with vinyl 
acetate 2; in the stabilized iminium catalyzed (E)polyene cyclization 3; in selective 
Rhodiumcatalyzed hydroformylation of terminal arylalkynes and conjugated enynes to 
(poly)enals enabled by a acceptor biphosphoramidite ligand 4; ironcatalysed 
asymmetric carboazidation of styrenes 5; in radical asymmetric aminoazidation and 
diazidation of styrenes 6; in palladiumcatalyzed tandem CC activationcyclization 
induced by carbopalladation of functionalized nitriles for synthesis of benzo 
dipyrromethenes 7; in preparation of triazole compounds that modulate HSP90 activity 
8; in solidphase synthesis of miconazole analogs via an iodoetherification reaction 9.
