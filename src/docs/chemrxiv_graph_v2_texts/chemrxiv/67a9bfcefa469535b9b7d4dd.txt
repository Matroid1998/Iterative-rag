Description:
An iconic class of conjugated polymers with alternating pphenylene and vinylene units, known for low solubility without side chains.

As a potential alternative to the attachment of side chains, there are reports indicating that 
macrocyclization can increase the solubility of conjugated molecules.1317 For molecules with 
alternating pphenylene and vinylene units, as known from the iconic class of conjugated 
polymers poly(pphenylene vinylene)s (PPVs),1820 this solubilizing effect appears to be 
particularly strong PPVs without side chains cannot be dissolved and processed from 
solution.18 Even for oligomers with only four phenylene units (Scheme 1, top left), extremely 
low solubility has been observed, with the solubility of the reported Eisomer found to be 
insufficient for 1H NMR measurements.21 In contrast, the corresponding macrocycle, 
paracyclophanetetraene (PCT; Scheme 1, top center), dissolves well in various organic solvents 
and the compound can be easily processed from solution.17,22,23 
Furthermore, conjugated macrocycles can also act as redoxactive units,17,2429 meaning that, 
unlike the attachment of aliphatic side chains, macrocyclization may even increase the specific 
capacity for use as a battery electrode material.
