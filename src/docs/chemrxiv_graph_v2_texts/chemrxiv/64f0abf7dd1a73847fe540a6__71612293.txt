Exhibits hole-doped superconductivity.

Regarding materials structure modifica
tion via doping and strain, and its subsequent impact on
superconductivity, several previous studies 10, 1822
attempted to understand the mechanism behind super
conductivity in various compounds, including those with
hexagonal crystal structure symmetry. For instance, the
dopinginduced Tc in Lidoped graphene 10 as well as in
holedoped C6H6 20, the biaxialtensilestrain doping
induced superconductivity in H2BN 21 and graphene
22, the straininduced enhancement of Tc in SrTiO3
19, and the emergence of highstrain anisotropic s and
dwave pairing in Sr2IrO4 18 compounds. These results
suggest that structural modification of materials can
alter their electronic structures and thereby influence
superconductivity. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20236bvbq ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000331917770 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
