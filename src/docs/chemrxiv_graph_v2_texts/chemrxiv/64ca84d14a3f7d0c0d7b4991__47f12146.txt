Description:
A Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor that interacts with primary therapeutic targets to suppress inflammation.

Text:
Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors were recently identified as promising drug candidates for 
repurposing in Alzheimers disease (AD) due to their capacity to suppress inflammation via modulation 
of JAKSTAT signalling pathways. Besides interaction with primary therapeutic targets, JAK inhibitor 
drugs frequently interact with unintended, often unknown, biological offtargets, leading to 
associated effects. Nevertheless, the relevance of JAK inhibitors offtarget interactions in the context 
of AD remains unclear. Methods Putative offtargets of baricitinib and tofacitinib were predicted using a machine learning 
(ML) approach. After screening scientific literature, offtargets were filtered based on their relevance 
to AD. Targets that had not been previously identified as offtargets of baricitinib or tofacitinib were 
subsequently tested using biochemical or cellbased assays.
