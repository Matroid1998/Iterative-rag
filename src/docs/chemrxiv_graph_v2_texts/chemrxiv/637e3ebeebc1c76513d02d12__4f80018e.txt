Description:
A compound involved in advanced capture technologies with cost implications in early-stage technology development.

Text:
As a result, several studies have attempted to 
44 
estimate the current cost of DACS,814 or project the cost of DACS into the future.1417 However, these 
45 
studies all use methods inconsistent with the nature of the cost development of earlystage technologies, 
46 
whose costs tend to rise during the research, development, and deployment (RDD) phase up to the 
47 
first deployed commercial scale plant, i.e., the firstofakind (FOAK) plant, and then start falling as a 
48 
function of deployment, as demonstrated in Figure 1. A recent method for the costing of advanced CO2 
49 
capture technologies was postulated by Rubin and coworkers.18 It is currently the only method 
50 
consistent with the cost trajectory of earlystage, low technology readiness level (TRL), technologies.
