Description:
Involved in metal plating at the anode during battery degradation.

Text:
Degradation of Liion batteries
stems from a plethora of physical mechanisms, such as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
formation1114 and lithium metal plating1518 at the anode and structural changes at the
cathode, such as oxidationinduced cation disorder19, rocksalt phasetransitions and den
sification20,21, antisite defects22, and secondary particle cracking23,24. These degradation
mechanisms lead to losses in rate capability by lowering accessible capacity at the same
current or power within the operating voltage range. When this measure of state of health
(SoH) reaches a given threshold, such as 80 of the nominal capacity under slow discharge,
