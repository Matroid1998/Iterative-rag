Description:
Based organic molecules are essential for synthetic chemists due to variable redox states.

Text:
Sulfur based organic molecules have always been a prime focus 
for synthetic chemists, owing to the existence of variable redox 
states that allows construction of several classes of organosulfur 
compounds.1 The prevalent role in biological metabolic 
processes made them essential for living organisms and their 
existence spans from marine to terrestrial systems.2 Sulfide 
moieties make up a prominent section of building blocks and 
versatile intermediates, which allows for widespread applications 
in synthetic chemistry, material science, pharmaceutical industry 
and biological applications (Scheme 1A).3 Sulfides and their 
derivatives can be found as one of the leading series of 
pharmaceutically active compounds among FDA listed 362 sulfur
containing drugs.4 For instance, dapsone, a wellknown antibiotic 
used for the treatment of leprosy, contains a sulfone scaffold.
