Description:
A gas that can be stored using metalorganic frameworks.

Text:
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline nanomaterials known for
their high internal surface areas, tunable chemistries, and wide range of pore sizes1. The variety of features makes MOFs promising materials for a wide range of applica
tions like carbon capture2, methane storage3, hydrogen storage4, photocatalysis5,
drug delivery6, conductivity7, and so on. To date, there are more than 100,000
experimentally reported MOF structures810 and millions of MOF structures that
have been predicted in silico2, 1118. From the perspective of material chemists, the holy grail is to design the most
promising materials for a given application19. Currently, the most commonly used
strategy is to find the best materials through brute force screening of these materials
library.
