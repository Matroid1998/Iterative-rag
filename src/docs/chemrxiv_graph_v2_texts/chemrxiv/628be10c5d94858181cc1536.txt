Polybenzenoid
hydrocarbons
(PBHs)
are
molecules comprising multiple fused benzene
rings. Such molecules are prevalent in chem
istry and in materials science; they play key
roles in various areas, from human health to
functional materials, to the study of interstel
lar space.1,2 They are known for their detrimen
tal impact as carcinogens3,4 and pollutants,57
as well as for their advantageous impact as
tunable organic semiconductors.811 Important
advances, such as the design of novel functional
PBHs or development of degradation pathways
for harmful compounds, rely on understanding
their properties and reactivity. Therefore, it is
no surprise that PBHs have been the subject
of extensive investigation for several decades,
nor that they continue to hold the attention of
chemists and material scientists.
