Description:
Generated offstoichiometry within a thermal redox cycle, beneficial for decarbonization efforts.

These materials1114 oper
ate by generating oxygen offstoichiometry within a ther
mal redox cycle (i.e., require only heat and no renew
able electricity consumption), which could prove bene
ficial for future decarbonization efforts. However, ac
curately predicting, identifying, modeling, and exper
imentally validating potential TCH materials is diffi
cult. Firstprinciples density functional theory calcula
tions (DFT) of defect thermodynamics and host stabil
ity typically inform materials discovery and selection 15
17, but only via 0 K calculations due to the prohibitively
large computational cost of highthroughput screening
based on finitetemperature simulations.
