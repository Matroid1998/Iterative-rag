Description:
A post transition metal promoter used in combination with varying supports for catalysts.

Both events lead to catalyst deactivation which is combated by constant regeneration cycles.1,4,5 Some regeneration strategies 
involve short PDH cycles followed by short flow of different gasses  oxidation in air (Pt dispersion and coke removal; sometimes 
oxychlorination to improve Pt dispersion), reduction with H2 (reactivation of the active phase)  which is repeated over years.4 
Therefore, the search for catalysts exhibiting high catalytic performances, combined with robustness towards repeated regeneration 
cycles is of major importance for further improving PDH catalysts. In order to find suitable materials, research efforts have concentrated on the use of post transition metal or main group element 
promoters like Zn613, B14,15, Ga1620, In2123 and Sn1,5,24 in combination with varying supports.
