Description:
A difluoro intermediate formed by replacing OH with F in the catalyst.

Text:
This 
reactive 
Mn(V)oxo 
intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to form 
Mn(IV)hydroxo intermediate (3), Mn(IV)(OH)(TMP)F, and a 
radical located on a carbon atom of the substrate (Figure 1). The 
next step involves the formation of a difluoro intermediate (4), 
Mn(IV)(TMP)F2, by replacing OH with F in the catalyst in the 
reaction with AgF (Figure 1). The fluoride in the axial position of 
the Mn(IV)(TMP)F2 intermediate then combines with the 
substrate radical to form the fluorinated product. This step is 
believed to be ratelimiting in the mechanism of the fluorination 
reaction. After this stage, the catalyst returns to its resting state 
(Figure 1).
