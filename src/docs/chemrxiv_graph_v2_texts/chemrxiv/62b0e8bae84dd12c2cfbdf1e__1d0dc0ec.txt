Description:
Has a special electronic configuration of 4f 14.

Recent advances in heavy element chemistry spurred by innovative molecular design, new 
spectroscopic techniques, and relativistic theory have evolved our understanding of the divergence 
between the chemistries of 5f elements and their 4f counterparts. Historically the primary 
distinction between these two series has been that early actinides display facile redox chemistry 
compared to lanthanides with the exception of those with special electronic configurations such as 
EuII (4f 7) and YbII (4f 14).1 This key attribute is largely lost in all transplutonium elements 
(excluding nobelium) where the most stable oxidation state is 3 akin to lanthanides.2 This has led 
to the notion that their chemistries are lanthanidelike.
