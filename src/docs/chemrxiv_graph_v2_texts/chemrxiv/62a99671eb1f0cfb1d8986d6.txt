Description:
Demonstrated to be valid for single crystals in nonspecifically adsorbing electrolytes according to the GCS model.

Text:
The two peaks 
move closer and eventually converge into a single peak as the electrolyte solution gets more and more 
concentrated.28 
The aptness of the GCS model has been corroborated on mercurylike electrodes, firstly by Gouy in the 
1910s and then by Grahame in the 1940s, see Parsonss review.29 In the presence of specific adsorption 
of anions, Grahame discriminated an inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and an outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) in 
the inner layer.30 More than just a modification of the Stern model, Grahames contributions sowed the 
seeds of ensuing developments considering fielddependent orientation of water molecules, 
discreteness of adsorbed ions, and quantum effects of metal electrons, as discussed in a recent 
tutorial.27 Valette and Hamelin and coworkers have demonstrated that the GCS model is valid also for 
silver single crystals in nonspecifically adsorbing electrolytes.3134
