Description:
Compounds with an in vivo half-life influenced by ester hydrolysis resistance.

For

Scheme 1. a) Schematic demonstrating the use of standard 
selfimmolative linkers to install ABS triggers will lead to high 
background. b) Linkers based on hydrolysisresistant ester 
ameliorates this concern.
