The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is an important and promising CO2 utilisation 
65 
technology that can lead to sustainable carbon cycles and the production of valuable fuels and base 
66 
chemicals for industrial applications. 13 Conducting the reaction in vapourfed cells with gas 
67 
diffusion electrodes (GDEs) allows the production of higher current densities (1 Acm2) due to the 
68 
sufficient transport of CO2 and lower diffusion length by virtue of their lower surface area. 4 However, 
69 
designing GDEs for optimal current densities and Faradaic efficiencies of desired products is an art 
70 
due to the plethora of multiscale effects that occur within them.
