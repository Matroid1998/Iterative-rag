Description:
A carbon-free energy carrier offering a sustainable energy system.

Text:
Climate change and its devastating environmental effects constitute the major longterm threats that our 
planet is facing. On the other hand, the depletion of fossil fuel reserves is a big challenge to the energy 
security of our society. It is anticipated that the annual energy consumption will be doubled by 2050 
compared to 2015 1. Relying on fossil fuels may partly solve this issue from an energy supply 
perspective; however, it will further escalate the environmental crisis via enormous CO2 release and 
that of other harmful emissions such as NOx and SOx 2. The use of hydrogen as a carbonfree energy 
carrier is a promising solution, offering a sustainable energy system 3.

Description:
A potentially sustainable and clean transportation fuel used in fuel cells, producing no pollutants or greenhouse gases.

Text:
Hydrogen is potentially the 
most sustainable and cleanest transportation fuel 4, 5 and is already used in fuel cells. It produces no 
pollutants nor greenhouse gases while having a high energy capacity 5. The primary advantage of 
hydrogen is that it can be transported and stored with minor losses using the current chemical fuel 
infrastructure with some modifications 6, making a smooth transition from fossil fuels possible. Nowadays, the majority of hydrogen, c.a. 95, is produced from fossil fuels via processes like methane
