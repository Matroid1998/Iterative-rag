Description:
Acts as a precursor in the formation of polyimides through molecular layer deposition.

Text:
Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is a type of atomic layer deposition (ALD), where 
organic thin films are deposited from the vapour phase through sequential, selflimiting reactions, 
generating thin films with high tunability, uniformity, and conformality.1 MLD as a technique was 
first discovered by Yoshimura et al. in 1991 to prepare polyimides through a diamine (2,4
diaminonitrobenzene or 4,4diaminodiphenyl ether) with pyrometallic dianhydride,2 and since its 
introduction, many compounds have been employed as precursors to generate thin films of

materials with thicknesses on the nanometer scale.
