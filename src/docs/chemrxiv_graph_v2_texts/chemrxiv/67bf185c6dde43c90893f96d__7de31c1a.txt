Description:
The most common electrolyte in the lithiummediated nitrogen reduction system.

Text:
In analogy to lithiumion batteries, a Solid Electro
lyte Interphase (SEI) layer forms on top of the active surface 
which consists of the decomposition products of the organic 
electrolyte3,1012. This SEI layer serves not only as protection 
from further electrolyte degradation but also regulates the ac
cess of key reactants (nitrogen, protons, and metal ions) to the 
active surface10,1321. One key aspect of the lithiummediated 
nitrogen reduction electrolyte is the proton donor, which has 
garnered significant attention recently.10,18,2224 The most 
common electrolyte in the lithiummediated nitrogen reduction 
system is tetrahydrofuran (THF) based, with a small quantity 
of ethanol added as a proton donor, although there have been 
investigations into other solvents25 and proton donors22. Until 
recently, the conventional wisdom was that ethanol acted as a 
sacrificial proton donor8,26.
