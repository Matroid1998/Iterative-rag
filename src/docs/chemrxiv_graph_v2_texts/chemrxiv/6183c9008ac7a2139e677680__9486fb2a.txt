Description:
Two-dimensional materials that are chemically inert and require high energy for covalent functionalization.

Text:
Functionalization of twodimensional (2D) materials, such as 
graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, is an important 
feature to tune the physical properties of 2D materials, from 
stability to processability, with the aim of improving their 
properties. The most common way to successfully functionalize 
a 2D material is arguably through reactions occurring in 
solution.1,2 However, as typical 2D materials are very inert 
compounds from a chemical point of view, the covalent 
functionalization process requires a lot of energy. Therefore, it 
is normally an uncontrolled step, thus causing defects, low 
degree of functionalization and attachment of molecules in 
random positions. Noncovalent functionalization is also an 
alternative approach, but it typically lacks longrange order, 
thus resulting in a material more similar to a composite.
