Description:
Used in interlayers to enable improved performance in lithium metal anodes.

These factors 
urgently motivate the development of lithium anodes that retain interfacial contact at high current densities 
and low stack pressures. A variety of interfacial engineering approaches has been pursued to improve the performance of 
lithium metal anodes in SSBs. Interlayers comprising other materials, such as carbon or lithium metal 
alloys, have been shown to enable improved performance. In general, these interlayer or composite 
materials enhance Li transport toward the SSE interface, homogenize current distributions, and can help 
maintain interfacial contact (2832). However, these approaches have primarily utilized hard or brittle 
interlayer materials to passively control Li transport, and some of these materials undergo transformations 
themselves (3335). These approaches therefore usually require stack pressures similar to that needed for 
Li metal to maintain interfacial contact (see Fig. S1).
