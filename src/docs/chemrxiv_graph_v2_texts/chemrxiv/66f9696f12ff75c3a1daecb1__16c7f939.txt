Description:
Forms a widebandgap semiconductor with energy gaps ranging from 2.3 to 3.7 eV, making it transparent in the UV or visible wavelengths.

Text:
GroupIII sesquioxides exhibit a pronounced polymorphism13 and, specically In2O3 and
Ga2O3 form widebandgap (WBG) and even ultrawidebandgap (UWBG) semiconductors
(in the case of Ga2O3) with promising properties for applications in optoelectronics and
power electronics.48 Energy gaps ranging from 2.3 to 3.7 (In2O3) or from 4.4 to 5.3 eV
(Ga2O3) with a strong absorption onset at around 3.6 eV (In2O3) make these materials
transparent in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible wavelengths region.1,2,9 Together with ndoping
and high electrical conductivity,4,10 this unusual combination of high optical transparency
and electrical conductivity places them in a very special class of materials of interest called
transparent conducting oxides (TCOs).2,11
Five polymorphs of Ga2O3 comprising rhombohedral corundum (), monoclinic (), de
fective spinel (), bodycentered cubic bixbyite (), and orthorhombic or hexagonal ()
phases12,13 are reported.

Description:
Can be grown as high-quality single-crystalline in the stable body-centered cubic bixbyite phase.

Text:
Recently, a subgroup  of the  polymorph was discovered.14,15
This dierentiation was accompanied by the reinterpretation of the originally identied or
thorhombic structure16 to be a hexagonal structure,17 while the  subgroup has orthorhom
bic symmetry. Similarly, pronounced polymorphism is also reported for indium oxide. It
is possible to grow highquality singlecrystalline In2O3 in the stable bodycentered cubic
(bcc) bixbyite phase, named bccIn2O3 or In2O3.18,19 The existence of a highpressure
corundumtype metastable rhombohedral (rh) polymorph known as rhIn2O3 or In2O3 is
also documented.20 Moreover, the orthorhombic phases 1, 2, and 3In2O3 have also been
discussed in literature.2,2123
