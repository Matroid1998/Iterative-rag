Description:
A metal-carbonyl complex observed in the CO stretch region during ultrafast nonlinear vibrational action spectroscopy.

Towards this goal, we recently demonstrated the collection of linear 
cryogenic ion vibrational spectra28 using an ultrafast IR pulse pair by monitoring photodissociation 
of a weaklybound N2 messenger tag molecule.2933 The Fourier transform of the timedomain 
tagloss interferogram, which derived from interferences in the excited vibrational coherences, 
yielded the linear frequencydomain spectrum. We also demonstrated the presence of detectable 
nonlinear signal, but did not frequencyresolve the response. Herein, we present the acquisition of ultrafast nonlinear vibrational action spectroscopy on 
cryogenically cooled, dilute molecular ion ensembles. Using a pulse shaper to control the ultrafast 
pulse sequence and isolate the desired nonlinear signal, we observe relatively strong bleaching 
signals in the CO stretch region of the metalcarbonyl complex facRe(CO)3(CH3CN)3 tagged
