Description:
Compounds that exhibit halochromism in UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra due to changes in conjugation states.

of an auxochrome, such as a hydroxy group, at the appropriate position in the 
chromophore would induce characteristic chromic properties depending on the resulting resonance 
hybrid. We designed two types of hydroxysubstituted dibenzoj,lfluoranthenes, with substitutions at 
positions 1 and 9, viz. 2ac and 3ac, respectively. We expected that the resonance contribution could 
be controlled by adjusting the position of the hydroxy substituent. Thus, the contribution of the 
fluorenyltype structure increased in the anion of 2, whereas that of the quinoidtype resonance 
increased in the anion of 3 (Figure 1). Herein, we report the syntheses and photophysical properties of 
dibenzoj,lfluoranthenes bearing a hydroxy group, which exhibit halochromism in their UVvis 
absorption and fluorescence spectra based on changes in their conjugation states.
