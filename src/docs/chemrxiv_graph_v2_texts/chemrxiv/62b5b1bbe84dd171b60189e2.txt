Description:
Used in combination with neoprene gloves for optimal protection against dimethylmercury.

Text:
While the materials safety data sheets at that 
time did not specify types of gloves that afford appropriate protection, Blayney has since shown 
that almost all types of laboratory gloves are permeable to dimethylmercury and that a combination 
of Silver Shield and neoprene gloves is now specified for optimal protection (6). In this Viewpoint 
we update and expand upon a discussion of alternative chemical shift standards that was first 
posted as a website at the time of Dr. Wetterhahns death (7). After addressing why 
dimethylmercury was employed in the initial set up of 199Hg NMR experiments and as a chemical 
shift standard, we outline the utility of alternative reference compounds and provide recent 
examples from the literature.
