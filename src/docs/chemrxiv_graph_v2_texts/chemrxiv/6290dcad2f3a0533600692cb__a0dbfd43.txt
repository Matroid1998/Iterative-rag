Description:
Linear ONiO was identified in an Ar matrix and referred to as NiO2.

Text:
There are relatively few experimental studies concerning the structure812 and reactivity of 
NiO20.1316 Neutral NiO2 was first studied in ideal gas matrices, where three isomers were 
identified in an Ar matrix9 cyclic Ni(O2), bent NiOO, and linear ONiO (referred to as NiO2 
hereafter). Subsequent work in Ne matrices found preferential formation of NiO2 with trace 
Ni(O2), allowing for the extraction of two and three vibrational frequencies for these species, 
respectively.12 In the gas phase, anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) has been used to probe 
the geometric and electronic structure of these species.
