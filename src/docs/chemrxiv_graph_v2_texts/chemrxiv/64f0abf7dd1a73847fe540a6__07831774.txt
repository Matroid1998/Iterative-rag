Description:
A compound involved in potential room temperature ambient-pressure superconductivity when copper-substituted.

in
Cusubstituted leadapatite, socalled LK99 compounds
1, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of
the relationships between the LK99 structure and
properties, which could further open up new avenues for
even hightemperature superconductivity (HTS). LK99
was reported to have Tc as high as 400 K (127 C) at
ambient pressure 1, leading to an immense interest
into further understanding of its exotic properties.
