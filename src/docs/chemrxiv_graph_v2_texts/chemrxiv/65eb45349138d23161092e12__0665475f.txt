Description:
An activator that leads to a more crystalline gel with higher aluminum incorporation.

As for OPC, the primary hydration product which is formed is an Aluminuminserted
47 
CalciumSilicateHydrate, CASH, phase gel811. The structure of the CASH formed 
48 
depends on the slag composition but mostly on the activator used. For example, the NaOH
49 
activation usually leads to a more crystalline gel with a higher Al incorporation than with 
50 
sodium silicates1215. Furthermore, more crosslinked gels are observed when sodium 
51 
silicates or sodium carbonate are used as activators than when NaOH is used15. Fernndez
52 
Jimnez et al.15 also found longer linear chains in the CASH precipitated in presence of 
53 
NaOH. Moreover, in the case of low Caenvironments, another type of aluminosilicate gel can 
54 
form, the NASH gel6.
