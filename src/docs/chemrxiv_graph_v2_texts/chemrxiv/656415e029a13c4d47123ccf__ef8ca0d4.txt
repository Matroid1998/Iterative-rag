Lightdriven molecular switches are promising candidates for applications such as optical data storage 
and photopharmacology1,2. An archetypical representative of photochromic molecular switches is 
azobenzene (AB) due to its outstanding photophysical properties, enabling an efficient EZ and ZE 
photoisomerization3. Rau and coworkers already demonstrated for sterically hindered ABs in the late 
1980s that the EZ and ZE photoisomerization quantum yields approach each other when the size 
of the substituents is increased4. These early results, albeit not involving timeresolved experiments, 
can be indicative of faster photoisomerization of twisted Eisomers. In 2014 Fuchter and coworkers presented arylazopyrazoles (AAPs) as a new class of photoswitchable 
azocompounds that overcome certain limitations of AB derivatives, particularly limited ZE 
backswitching performance and Zisomer thermal stability57.

Description:
A compound with reduced Eisomer photoisomerization quantum yields compared to the Zisomer due to slower EZ than ZE switching dynamics.

concludes that these AAPs should retain the lifetimes, 
excitation energies, conical intersections, and barrierless S1 potential energy surface of ABs.8 On the 
other hand, this similarity suggests that AAPs inherit an imperfection in the dynamics of typical ABs 
their Eisomer photoisomerization quantum yields are reduced in comparison to those of the Zisomer 
due to slower EZ than ZE switching dynamics.9,10 The groups of Herges and Temps found a solution 
for this problem dihydrodibenzodiazocine, a bridged azobenzene with significantly improved EZ 
quantum yields (50  instead of 24 for AB) due to the twisted preorientation of the Eisomer.11 The 
sensitivity of lifetimes in the photoexcited state to preorientation was hypothesized to originate from 
an initial stabilizing force that acts against the twisting force of the azo antibonding state.1215 
For an EAAP with two methyl groups in orthoposition of the phenyl ring, the DFT calculations by 
Bckmann and Doltsinis revealed a twisted groundstate geometry; note that in this case, the 
molecular twist is caused by sterical hindrance in contrast to the bridged AB which, in addition to the 
connecting azo moiety, requires an additional covalent CC linkage between the two rings.
