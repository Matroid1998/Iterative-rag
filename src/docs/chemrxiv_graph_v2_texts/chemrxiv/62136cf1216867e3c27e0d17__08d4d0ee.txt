have also been engineered with sophisticated drugrelease mechanisms21,22 that feature enzyme
mediated disassembly of a prodrug inside tumour cells via multiple cleavage steps that separate a 
stabilising macrocycle from a cytotoxic drugcapped axle.18 
Relatively few examples exist where supramolecular chemistry was employed in the design 
of molecular imaging agents. Lusby, Archibald and coworkers reported the successful 
radiosynthesis of a supramolecular complex by encapsulating the gray emitting 99mTcTcO4 
pertechnetate anion inside the cavity of a tetrahedral Co(III)4L6metallocage, where L is a 
terpyridinebased ligand, for applications in singlephoton emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) imaging (Figure 1).23 In vivo imaging showed that the 99mTcmetallocage complex had
