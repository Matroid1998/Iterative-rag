Description:
Shows a remarkable contraction between 0.3-1050 K owing to coupled rotations of rigid unit vibrational modes.

Text:
These include
phase transitions, transverse vibrational modes and rigid unit
modes.5 For example, ZrW2O8 shows a remarkable contraction
between 0.31050 K owing to coupled rotations of rigid unit vibra
tional modes.1 NTE appears to occur more frequently in frame
work materials.
