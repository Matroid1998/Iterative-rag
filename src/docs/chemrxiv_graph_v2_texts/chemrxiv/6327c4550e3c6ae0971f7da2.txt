Description:
Function as flavor-related components in biological tissues.

Text:
Metabolites, a group of small biomolecules with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds with 
molecular weights less than 1,000 Da, constitute the basic components of biological tissues. They are 
also important as phenotypic determinants of food materials in live animal and plant tissues because 
metabolites such as amino acids (AAs), lipids, and nucleotide phosphates function as flavorrelated 
components after harvest 1. Moreover, metabolites in biological tissues, including animal blood, 
represent phenotypic signatures of tissue samples, which can be utilized to monitor and evaluate tissue
