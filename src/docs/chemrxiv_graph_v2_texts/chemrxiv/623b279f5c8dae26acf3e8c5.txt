Description:
Used in precipitation to partially purify enzymes.

Text:
Partial purification of enzymes can also be carried out by simpler methods such as heat 
shock (for thermophilic proteins) and ammonium sulfate precipitation, often at the expense of the purity 
degree of the cellfree enzyme.3 On the other hand, wholecell biocatalysts are desirable for multistep 
transformations that require several enzymes, or for cofactordependent reactions.4 Likewise, whole
