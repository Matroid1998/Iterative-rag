Description:
Surface salts predicted to exist on Pb(111) electrodes in the presence of a nitrate electrolyte.

Text:
In fact, the existence
of PbNO3 surface salts has been predicted by first
principles calculations for Pb(111) electrodes in the pres
ence of a nitrate electrolyte 23, 24. These surface salts
have been suggested to be instrumental in the function
ing of atomicscale transistors 2426. In this computational study, we will consider the ad
sorption of chlorine on the most stable surface termina
tion of magnesium, Mg(0001) 27 for a range of different
coverages by means of density functional theory calcu
lations. Using grandcanonical concepts 2831, we will
