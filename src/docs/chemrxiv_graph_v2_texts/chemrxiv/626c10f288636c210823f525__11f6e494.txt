Description:
A natural material used as a support to prevent aggregation of Pd catalysts.

Text:
Pdbased catalysts synthesize vital pharmaceutical 
drugs and valuable organic derivatives 2426. However, some reported catalysts require a high 
cost of ligands, difficult separation, and low recyclability. Various supports circumvent some of 
these challenges by preventing aggregation and offering several active Pd catalysts sites. The 
supports can be classified as natural materials (e.g., palygorskite27, wool28, halloysite29), 
inorganic (e.g., ZrO2 30, TiO2 31, CuO 32, CeO2 33, SiO2 34), an organic polymer (e.g., 
chitosan 35, polyphenylene 36, and COFs 3740), and hybrid materials (e.g., metalorganic 
frameworks (MOFs) 4146). Among these supports, organic polymers, e.g., COFs, exhibit 
several advantages, such as high stabilization properties for Pd nanoparticles, preventing 
aggregation or agglomeration, high catalytic performance, and strong interactions 47,48. 3
