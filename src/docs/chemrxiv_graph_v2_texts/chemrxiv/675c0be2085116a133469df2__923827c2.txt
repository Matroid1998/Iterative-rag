Description:
Poisons many metal catalysts, complicating the synthesis of thiols and thioethers.

Text:
Indeed, only few examples exist for the biocatalytic synthesis of thiols and thioethers (Figure 
1C), most of which start from racemic compounds and employ (dynamic) kinetic resolutions.710 Their 
synthesis by chemical means, such as metal catalysis, is also challenging due to the poisoning effect of 
sulfur on many metal catalysts.11 Furthermore, the reactivity of thiols further complicates enantiocontrol 
due to uncatalyzed background reactivity. While some natural products contain chiral thiols and thioethers, the strategy for their synthesis 
in nature either relies on the asymmetric enzymatic synthesis of other functional groups (such as 
epoxides) followed by substitution, or the use of radical enzymes.12 These enzymes are typically very 
substrate specific, and thus do not appear promising as general biocatalysts in a synthetic organic 
chemistry context.

Description:
A substituent that can participate in radical chemistries.

Text:
This strategy 
requires the enzyme to accept the large size of the sulfur substituent at the double bond, and control both 
the reactive acyl radical intermediate as well as the orientation of the cosubstrate to prevent 
unselective radical chemistries occurring at the sulfur.27
