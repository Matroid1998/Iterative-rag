Description:
Formed in small amounts at 0.8 V with increasing formation beyond 1.2 V.

Text:
The formation of HCOOH and a small amount of 
CO was first observed at 0.8 V. As the potential became 
more negative (from 1.0 V to 1.4 V), the selectivity for 
HCOOH 
increased 
significantly, 
reaching 
saturation 
(FEHCOOH 26) at 1.2 V, where hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER) was nearly at constant. Beyond 1.2 V, the 
formation of CO is increasing with the increasing potential 
where the HER and FEHCOOH are almost constant. To evaluate 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
material 
under 
the 
applied 
electrochemical conditions, we identified the constant 
current densities at each voltage for one hour duration 
(Figure 4e). Chronoamperometric measurements were 
then conducted at 1.0 V for a period of 6 hours to determine 
the materials practical applicability (Figure S13).
