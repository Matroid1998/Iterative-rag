Description:
A chlorinated methane with an adsorption energy of 25 to 40 kJ mol in DUT8(Ni).

Text:
We recently presented
the possibility to perform molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of DUT8(Ni) by employing
Ligand Field Molecular Mechanics (LFMM) for
the description of the metal nodes.25 Alzahrani
and Deeth lately also conrmed the applicabil
ity of LFMM for the description of exibility in
MOFs.29
