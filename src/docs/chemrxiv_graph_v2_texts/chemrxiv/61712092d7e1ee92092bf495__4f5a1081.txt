Description:
A reagent used for installing the N-hydroxy unit in a bulk water phase.

Text:
Our desired route requires a cytidine 
aminotransferase capable of selectively installing the Nhydroxy unit from NH2OH in a bulk water 
phase (Fig. 1). To meet the demands of a robust industrial biocatalyst, we set ourselves the target of 
developing an engineered enzyme capable of operating at S 100 gL and achieving 90 conversion
