Description:
Serve as catalysts for the conversion of carboxylic acids in biofuel preparation.

Text:
Catalytic conversion of carboxylic acids on metal oxides is important for the deoxygenation of 
feedstock for the preparation of biofuels and lubricants,14 and for the industrial preparation of 
specific ketones3,57. The interaction of carboxylic acids with the surface of highcrystallineenergy 
metal oxides begins with acid adsorption,812 forming surface carboxylates, with or without 
dissociation of the carboxyl group. This is followed by various decomposition reactions, leading 
to the formation of alkane and CO2,13,14 ketene and water,15,16 alkene, CO, and water,17,18 or ketone 
and CO2.19,20 In all cases, upon acid contact with a metal oxide surface, a hidden reaction, alpha
proton abstraction, may consistently occur leading to the enolization of carboxylic acids even 
under mild conditions.
