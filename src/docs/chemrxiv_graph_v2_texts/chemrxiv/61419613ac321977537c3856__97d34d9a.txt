Description:
Undergoes dimerization at 0.4 V vs RHE for C2 based product formation.

Text:
Hori and coworkers have demonstrated that CH4 is the main product on Cu(111) 
surface whereas C2H4 is the major product on Cu(100) surface.1315 In this context, Koper and co
workers have shown two different pathways on the periodic Cu(100) surface for the formation of 
C2 based product.1618 Both the pathways have some common intermediates which can form CH4 
at 0.8 to 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In this case, the most important step for 
C2 based product formation is the dimerization of CO at 0.4 V vs RHE. After these reports,
