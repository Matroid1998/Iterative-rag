Description:
Coexists with piezoelectricity and magnetism in 2D monolayers.

Encouragingly,
although 2D ferroelectrics are relatively rare to date, gi
ant inplane piezoelectric response is discovered in ferro
electric monolayers of groupIV monochalcogenides14. A moderate outofplane piezoresponse is also ob
served in ferroelectric buckled monolayers and In3Se3
nano akes15. Furthermore, coexistence of piezoelec
tricity and magnetism and their coupling in 2D materi
als namely vanadium dichalcogenide monolayers16 and
1HLaBr2 monolayer17 have been investigated. Any
strong coupling between piezoelectricity and magnetism
can be utilized for making piezoelectricbased multifunc
tional nanodevices. In this regard, multiferroelectric ma
terials can be rst choice because they usually exhibit
good coupling between electric polarization and mag
netic order.
