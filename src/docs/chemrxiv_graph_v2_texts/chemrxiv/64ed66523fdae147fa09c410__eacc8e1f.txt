Description:
Photoactive under UV irradiation, triggering bonding between carbon atoms at the two aryl units to form a six-membered ring.

Organic molecules able to act as photoswitches are very attractive in the field of 
photoresponsive materials,15 with particular importance in optoelectronics67 and 
photobiological applications.89 Photoswitching in these molecules arises from the existence 
of two or more structural isomers that can interconvert upon light absorption.10 Several classes 
of photoswitchable molecules are known, including azobenzenes,11 spiropyrans,1214 
norbornadienes,15 and diarylethenes (DAEs).1618 In general, DAEs are photoactive under 
UV irradiation, triggering bonding between carbon atoms at the two aryl units and resulting in 
the formation of a sixmembered ring, which can often be reversibly converted back to the 
ringopen form with visible light.
