Description:
Used in battery-grade salt precursors for lithium batteries.

Text:
Demand for batterygrade lithium (Li) salt precursors (99.5) has abruptly ramped up in the last few 
years driven by the fastgrowing market of lithium batteries for the electrification of transport. For 
instance, global Li production in 2022 has reported a significant increase of 21 from the previous year 
when compared to other mineral commodities.1 This is only going to grow exponentially as 
demonstrated by the recently updated McKinseys estimation of the Liion battery market growth, 
which now reports a 6.7 times increase from 700 GWh in 2022 to 4.7 TWh by 2030, instead of the 
previously reported 2.6 TWh by 2030.2 
Highpurity precursors for battery materials are produced from either hardrock minerals or Lirich 
brines through a beneficiation process. The final step in processing is purification.
