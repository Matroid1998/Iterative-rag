Description:
Part of ternary boron carbon nitrides with extraordinary properties.

Among those, the introduction of 
nitrogen in certain fashions was proven to boost conductivity and oxidation stability, even 
increasing the Fermi level above the level of noble metals, nowadays commonly referred 
to as Noble Carbons.12 Old materials as carbon nitride made a strong comeback, and 
new materials classes with extraordinary properties were explored, such as ternary boron 
carbon nitrides, C2N and more.38 Recent research focused especially on the introduction 
of nitrogen into covalent sp2hybridized structures, with less attention paid to materials 
composed of carbon and oxygen.12, 45, 7, 911 
The broadly known carbon oxides are carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) 
are gases. However, there are countless more carbon oxide compounds, among the 
linear carbon dioxides, with the general formula CnO2 (n1).
