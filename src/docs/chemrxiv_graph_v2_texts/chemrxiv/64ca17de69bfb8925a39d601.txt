Description:
Has low reactivity and considerably higher bond dissociation energy compared to analogous polarized bonds.

Text:
The low 
reactivity is reflected in the considerably higher bond dissociation energy (BDE) values compared to 
those of analogous polarized bonds such as C(sp3)Br bonds (Figure 1, top left).3,4 Traditional 
synthetic strategies to overcome the unfavored CO bond cleavage relies on stoichiometric 
functionalization of the hydroxyl group into a better leaving group.
