Description:
A greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.

Text:
Climate change is an undeniable fact and the escalating level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is one of 
the most pressing environmental concerns of our age.

Description:
A greenhouse gas that can be utilized as a C1 feedstock for industrially relevant chemicals.

The environmental consequences are basis for 
political initiatives on a global scale, which are driven by the aim of reducing the emission of greenhouse 
gases, most notably carbon dioxide.1 Technologies exist that are able to trap the CO2 from the flue gas 
of major emitters, however, the price of carbon dioxide is too low to be a motivation for industrials to 
increase their efforts in recovering the greenhouse gas.2 The utilization of CO2 as a C1 feedstock for the 
generation of industrially relevant chemicals is certainly an interesting different approach.3 CO2 is an 
attractive renewable C1 source, which can lead to fuelrelated products such as methane, methanol, and 
formic acid.4 Those approaches would not only reduce the carbon dioxide emission through carbon 
capture, the costs of the sequestration could also be compensated by the production of chemicals which 
are in global demand.5 Most of the liquid fuels used are based on fossil fuels, which again generate new 
CO2 in the atmosphere.
