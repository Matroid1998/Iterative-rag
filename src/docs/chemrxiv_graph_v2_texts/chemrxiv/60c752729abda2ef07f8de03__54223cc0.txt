Description:
Substitutes for diazo compounds in cyclopropanation.

Text:
Much attention has been given in recent years to the preparation of 
enantiopure cyclopropyl compounds because such compounds occur widely in natural 
products1,2 and synthetic pharmaceuticals and their enantiomers often exhibit different 
biological activities3,4. So, the efficient stereoselective synthesis of chiral nonracemic 
cyclopropanes continues to be one of the important tasks in organic synthesis. A variety of 
efficient synthetic methods were reported, of which SimonsSmith reaction and metal
catalysed57 decomposition of diazo compound in the presence of alkenes have been 
known for years. Based on previous studies of Cohen8,9 and Julia10 proposed that Sulfur 
ylides11,12 as a substitute for the potentially explosive, toxic, and carcinogenic diazo 
compounds13 in cyclopropanation.

It is well known, that sulfur ylides14 react with carbonyl groups or with electron deficient 
carboncarbon double bond in a twostep reaction to afford epoxide or cyclopropanes, 
respectively.15 Sulfur ylide in situ generated by treatment of ethyl dimethyl sulfonium 
acetate bromide with DBU, were reacted with ab cyclic enones,16,17 chiral enones18 and 
with Nenoyl oxazolidinones in presence of Lewis acids19 are reported in the literature. However, the use of chiral auxiliary unsaturated ester or amide with stabilised sulfur 
ylide is limited. So far few methods has been reported, such as using pyroglutamic acid 
(O,Nacetal and NBocpyrrolinone) as a chiral auxiliary  unsaturated amide with 
stabilized sulfur ylide.12,20 However the Diastereoselectivity is very poor. Still there are 
demands for better Diastereoselectivity methods.
