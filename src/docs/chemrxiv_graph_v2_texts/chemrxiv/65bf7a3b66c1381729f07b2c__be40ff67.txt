Description:
A commercially available biodegradable polyester.

Biodegradable polymers are defined as natural or synthetic polymers that can be broken down by biological 
processes, typically into harmless natural compounds, over time1. These polymers have a wide range of 
biomedical applications, including drug delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds, sutures, and various 
implantable devices. They are designed to degrade gradually within the body, which can be advantageous 
for controlled release of drugs or supporting tissue regeneration2. Aliphatic polyesters have emerged as 
leading candidates due to their high susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis and degradation by 
microorganisms3. Commercially available biodegradable polyesters such as poly(butylene succinate) 
(PBS), poly(butylene succinatecoadipate) (PBSA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), 
poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC), and poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) have shown great potential4.
