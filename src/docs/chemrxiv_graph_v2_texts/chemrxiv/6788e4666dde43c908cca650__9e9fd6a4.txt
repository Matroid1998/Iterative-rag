Description:
A structure that can replace benzene to achieve high yield and enantioselectivity.

Text:
Various alkyl zinc reagents substituted with fluo
rine atoms or methyl groups at the para or meta positions of the 
benzene ring can achieve high efficiency (4m, 4n, 4o and 4p). Re
placing the benzene with naphthalene (4q) also results in a high 
yield and er. Notably, upon homologation of the carbon chain from 
the methyl group to the ethyl or propyl group, the desired products 
could also be obtained in good yield and enantioselectivity (4r, 4s). Finally, the absolute configuration of 3v was determined to be the 
(S)form by Xray crystallographic diffraction analysis.
