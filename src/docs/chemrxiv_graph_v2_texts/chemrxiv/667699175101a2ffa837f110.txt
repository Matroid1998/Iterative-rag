Recent advances in structural biology, from sample preparation, to synchrotron infrastructure
20
and data analysis pipelines, have transformed the throughput of proteinligand complexes
21
available to inform drug discovery campaigns.1 When soaked with carefully designed com
22
pound libraries,2 the numbers of small molecule (or fragment) structural hits can reach 10s
23
or 100s against a single therapeutic target.3 A frequently employed next step is to attempt to
24
grow andor link the hit compounds, using either custom synthesis2 or ordering from cata
25
logues of purchasable compounds.4,5 However, chemical space is vast such that even choosing
26
followup compounds for purchase from ondemand libraries, such as the readily accessible
27
(REAL) Enamine database6 ( 5.5 bn compounds in 2022), becomes highly nontrivial.7
28
As such, attention is turning to cheminformatics and machine learning based algorithms
29
for structurebased de novo hit expansion, linking and merging.8 A wide range of approaches
30
are available to build from initial structural biology data, including DeepFrag9 that identifies
31
promising fragments for addition to an input bound ligand, using a deep convolutional
32
neural network, and DEVELOP10 that combines 3D pharmacophoric constraints from the
33
binding pocket with a graphbased deep generative model for Rgroup and linker design.
