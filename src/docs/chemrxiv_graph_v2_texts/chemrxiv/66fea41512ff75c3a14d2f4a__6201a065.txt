Description:
Used as a dopant in BiVO4 to increase conductivity and enhance water oxidation kinetics.

The system showed significantly 
enhanced PEC performance, featuring lower photocurrent 
onset potentials and higher charge transfer efficiency.21 These 
initial studies suggest that CoPOM is a promising cocatalyst 
for PEC water oxidation at BiVO4 photoanodes, as it improves 
the photogenerated hole extraction and enhances the oxygen 
evolution reaction kinetics. This inspired the present study to 
explore how a double use of bulk and surface deposition of 
CoPOM can be used to optimize the performance 
Notably, transition metal doping is an established strategy to 
improve the conductivity of BiVO4 and promote the PEC per
formance. For example, He et al. developed BiVO4 nanoflake 
array films codoped with Mo and W to increase the conduc
tivity of BiVO4 and to slightly to enhance the water oxidation 
kinetics.22 Fang et al.
