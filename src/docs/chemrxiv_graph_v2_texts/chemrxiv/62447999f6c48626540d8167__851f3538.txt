Description:
Mainly investigated and applied in industrial methanation due to high activity and selectivity towards CH4.

Despite several metals, such as Ru, Rh, Co and Fe, are active for methanation Ni is mainly 
18 
investigated in research and applied in industrial production, due to the high activity and 
19 
selectivity towards CH4 17. Besides these advantages, Ni catalysts suffer from high human 
20 
and environmental toxicity 1821. Therefore, ironbased catalysts attract attention as a 
21 
suitable alternative for COx hydrogenation reactions, because iron is abundant, costefficient 
22 
and less harmfull to the environment with only little cutbacks in activity and selectivity in 
23 
methanation 22.
