Description:
A VVIVII layered ternary semiconductor with a unique layered structure that produces a built-in electric field.

Text:
Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl), a promising VVIVII layered ternary semiconductor, has been 
widely studied in environmental and energy conversion applications 1, 2. It is a layered 
structure with Bi2O22 slabs interleaved by a double layer of Cl ions. Compared to other metal
oxide semiconductors, this unique layered structure produces a builtin electric field and 
facilitates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers 3, 4. However, the large bandgap 
(3.4 eV) in the UV range and low quantum efficiency of bulk BiOCl photocatalysts have seriously 
hampered their photocatalytic application 5, 6. Up to now, several strategies have been proposed to solve the abovementioned issues, 
including nonmetal doping, preparation of homojunction and heterojunction composites7, 8, 
or metal cocatalyst deposition9.
