Description:
Gas that can be adsorbed in hydroquinone clathrates with double and triple occupancy at elevated pressures.

The hydroquinone H2 clathrate
was found experimentally only after a computational study
predicted that such clathrates can form and that they may
have more than one H2 molecule in each pore (10), obviously
of great interest for gas storage applications. The computa
tional predictions have since been conrmed; the clathrate
exhibits fast and reversible adsorption of hydrogen gas at
room temperature and has double and triple occupancy of H2
at elevated pressures (11, 12). In addition, the demonstrated
separation of ethanemethane and CO2N2 gas mixtures by
hydroquinone clathrate is another example of a potential in
dustrial application (13, 14).
