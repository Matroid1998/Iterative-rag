Description:
Produced in water electrolysis, with efficiency influenced by OER catalysts.

The generation of green hydrogen as a renewable energy carrier 
via water electrolysis is pivotal in addressing the interconnected 
challenges posed by fossil fuels.13 To date, two main 
techniques, namely alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and 
proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), stand 
out as the most viable options for industrialscale clean 
hydrogen production.4,5,6 AWE typically offers higher material 
compatibility, enabling the use of earthabundant transition 
metals to reduce capital expenses. Meanwhile, the unique 
character of AWE also contributes to a longer electrolyzer 
lifetime of up to 10 years.3 However, the ongoing request for 
highly effective OER catalysts to improve the overall H2 
production efficiency remains a limiting factor for transition 
metalbased AWE systems.
