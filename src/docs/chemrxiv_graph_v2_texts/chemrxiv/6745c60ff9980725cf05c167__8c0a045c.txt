Description:
Protonated forms that demonstrate acidic properties.

Text:
on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding 
carboxylic acids  protonated primary amines was demonstrated. The impact of the OCF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) were found 
to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding 
polar moieties governed the compounds overall properties in this 
case. Biological evaluation of MAPK kinase inhibitors incorporating 
the title substituents demonstrated their utility as promising 
fragments for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery campaigns.
