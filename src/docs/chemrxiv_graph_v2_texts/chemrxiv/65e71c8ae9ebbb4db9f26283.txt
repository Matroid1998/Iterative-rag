Description:
A gas whose affinity increases uptake but also increases the heat of adsorption, affecting regeneration energy demands.

This has driven an intense effort on 
advancing sorbent materials to reduce process costs, 
including 
increasing 
CO2 
capacity,14, 
15 
reducing 
regeneration energy requirements,1618 and increasing 
sorbent stability.19, 20 
However, many of these sorbent properties are 
interconnected, 
often 
in 
inverse 
relationships. For 
example, increasing the CO2 affinity increases the CO2 
uptake, but it also increases the CO2 heat of adsorption, 
thus increasing regeneration energy demands. Similarly, 
increasing the desorption temperature can improve the 
working capacity, but it may also accelerate the 
degradation rate and shorten the sorbent lifetime. Without 
the guidance of an economic model tailored to DAC, it is 
challenging to determine whether improving one property 
actually reduces overall process costs when considering 
other properties.

Description:
A gas that binds with amines to form various compounds such as carbamate and carbonate.

Text:
Aminebased sorbents are a common choice in DAC 
technologies due to their high affinity for CO2, even at low 
concentrations.30 Amines bind CO2 through chemical 
bonds to form carbamate, carbamic acid, hydronium 
carbamate, carbonate, or bicarbonate; the endproduct 
depends on the amine surface coverage, presence of water, 
and aminesolid support interactions.18, 3134 This results in 
steep adsorption isotherms (strong Type I) that lead to 
significant CO2 uptakes at low CO2 partial pressures  a 
critical feature for DAC applications.3537 Implementing 
amines in structured contactors can enable a lower 
pressure drop, indirect heating, and thermal management 
(i.e., cooling) during adsorption.38 Temperature or 
temperaturevacuum swing adsorption are the process 
modes typically coupled with amine sorbents, as the high 
uptake at low partial pressures makes adsorption based 
on pressure swing alone a challenging option.39 
Polymeric or oligomeric amines (polyamines) are a 
particularly promising form of amine due to their high 
density of amine sites and lower volatility compared to 
smaller amine molecules.
