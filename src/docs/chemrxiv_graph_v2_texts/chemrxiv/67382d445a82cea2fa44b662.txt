Description:
Used as a filler in composites to fabricate conductive paths.

3DP 
56 
electrodes have been used to detect trinitrotoluene 10, tetracycline 11, dopamine 12, and caffeine 
57 
13, and much more. However, only a few available reports focus on pharmaceutical diagnostics 
58 
14,15, usually reaching micromolar detection limits. 59 
Most available reports focus on the use of commercially available filament dedicated to 3DP, 
60 
ProtoPasta fabricated from thermoplastic polymer poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and carbon black (CB) filler. 61 
Many authors have fabricated dedicated composites with different fillers, i.e., carbon black (CB) 27, 
62 
carbon nanotubes 28, graphene 29, graphite 3, or even nanodiamond derivatives 12 in an amount 
63 
sufficient to fabricate percolation conductive paths (see Fig. 1b). Such a procedure makes a 3D printout 
64 
an attractive electrode material.
