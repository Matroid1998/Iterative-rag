Description:
Indispensable for various physiological and pathological processes including facilitation of enzymatic processes, DNA replication, cell differentiation, and protection against oxidative stresses.

Cupric ions (Cu2) is the pivotal trace metal present in the human body and is indispensable for 
various physiological and pathological processes including facilitation of enzymatic processes, DNA 
replication, cell differentiation and protection against oxidative stresses.13 Anomalous imbalance of 
cellular Cu2 levels in human body resulting in number of pathological conditions related to renal 
diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers, Parkinsons and Wilsons 
diseases.45 Moreover, Cu2 is also a crucial metal pollutant in water and soil environment which could 
lead to the gradual accumulation in the plants and animals and ultimately to the humans.6 Thus, taking 
into consideration the adverse effects of aberrant concentrations of Cu2 ions, number of analytical 
methods have been used for its identification and estimation including electrochemical processes7, atomic 
absorption spectroscopy8, inorganic mass spectrometry9, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy10, 
surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy11, and immunechromatographic assay12, but mostly these 
methods demand highly qualified professionals and instrumentation thus becomes very expensive and 
timeconsuming.
