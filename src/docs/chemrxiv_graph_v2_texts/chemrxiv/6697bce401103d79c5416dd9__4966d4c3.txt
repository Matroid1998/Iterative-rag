Organometal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as a promising group of materials with excellent 
optoelectronic properties. Consequently, filmbased perovskite devices have undergone rapid development.16 
Currently, the most commonly used methods for preparing MHP films include spincoating, spraycoating, slotdie 
coating, blade coating, and inkjet coating. While the specific techniques for depositing the precursor solutions onto 
the substrate might differ, all typically involve a subsequent thermal annealing step. This crucial annealing step aims 
at eliminating any residual solvents or additives present in the film and at fully crystallizing the black perovskite 
phase. Consequently, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the annealing process is paramount.
