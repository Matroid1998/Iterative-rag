Description:
A metal used as an anode material in energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific capacity, low redox potential, and low gravimetric density.

Text:
Lithium metal is one of the most frequently used elements for the anode material in post
lithium ion energy storage systems due to its very high theoretical specic capacity (3860 mAhg1),
the lowest redox potential (3.04 V vs. SHE) and a low gravimetric density (0.534 g cm3).1,2
Among these technologies, we can mention LiS and LiAir.3,4 However, one of the main
issues under study with this electrode is the growth of metal dendrites on its surface
during deposition. Such formations introduce safety and cyclability concerns, decreasing
coulombic eciency and provoking capacity fading.5,6 Extensive research has been done
to propose dierent strategies to control dendrite growth,7,8 while trying to character
ize the conditions under which dendrites occur.

Description:
Studied for its metal interface during electrodeposition using coarse-grained models.

Text:
Computational studies are progressively
contributing to these eorts.913 Coarsegrained models are of great interest for studying
the lithium metal interface during electrodeposition, as they allow exploration of longer
space and time scales compared to full atomistic approaches. Given the mismatch between
dendrite dimensions (approximately m) and molecular size, the simplied representa
tion of this system also becomes necessary to make the problem manageable.14 Neverthe
less, these models require further development to better represent the system and enable
quantitative comparisons with experimental observations. Longer time scales are desired
to properly describe experiments while maintaining the level of detail that the simula
tion allows. This detail is of great interest for the proper understanding of the nanoscale
processes that lead to the onset of dendrite formation.
