Description:
Compounds developed for enhanced emission response in aggregation-induced emission.

Text:
Popularly known as aggregation
induced emission,14 it holds great application poten
tial in various technologies including displays, sensing 
and imaging.15 A fine balance of factors that inhibit 
nonradiative excited state energy loss channels and 
intermolecular energy transfer pathways, is key to the 
realization of the enhanced emission response.16,17 
Families of molecules that have been developed in 
this context include tetraphenylethylenes,18 siloles,19 
triphenylamines,20 
acetylantharacenes,21

dihydrocyclopentaaindenes22 and diaminodicyano
quinodimethanes (DADQs).23 Fluorescence emission 
switching due to the modification of molecular struc
