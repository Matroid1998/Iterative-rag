Description:
Used in covalent labelling methods for live cell surfaces with minimal perturbation.

Text:
An ideal method for labelling surfaces of live cells would be applicable to any kind of cell and impose 
only little perturbation. Probes should have low molecular weight to allow high resolution imaging and 
facilitate tissue penetration, which would be a benefit for in vivo measurements of genetically nonmodi
fied specimen. Furthermore, labeling should proceed quickly with as few wash steps as possible. We 
reasoned that these criteria could, in principle, be met by an optimized sialic acid labelling developed by 
Kellam4 and DawsonPaulson,5 which stands out as a covalent labelling method introducing the smallest 
possible cargo.
