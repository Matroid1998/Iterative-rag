To speed up the identification of biodegradable materials and their substitutes, filtering of large 
sets for highthroughput molecular discovery is an attractive option.2 
Chemical prediction with quantitative structureactivity relationships (QSAR) uses descriptorbased statistical 
analysis to derive relationships, and have been used to identify molecular features contributing to the octanol
water partition (logP) and solubility.3 Unlike physicochemical properties with relatively consistent pathways and 
activating structures, properties such as bioavailability and toxicity are dependent on a combination of molecular 
mechanisms. Thus, a small group of descriptors is not sufficient to characterise such properties. A concept of note 
in the field is the applicability domain (AD)4, where the predictions of a model fall into a threshold of certain 
related compounds.
