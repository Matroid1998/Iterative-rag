Description:
Forms a protective layer preventing agglomeration and oxidation of Ru nanoparticles while providing weak and medium basic sites.

Text:
However, strategies have 
emerged to improve methanation activity. For instance, ionic liquids can be employed to 
stabilize the dispersion of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2 23. 1butyl3methylimidazolium 
tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4) can form a protective layer that prevents the agglomeration 
and oxidation of Ru nanoparticles while also providing weak and medium basic sites. Highly
