Description:
Increasingly attractive as models for metal-O2 complexes.

For this, they de
veloped a series of tripodal copper complexes bearing 
amino groups in the secondary coordination sphere which 
could function as hydrogen bond donors (Figure 1a.) They 
were able to establish a correlation between the thermal 
stability of the peroxo complexes and the number of hydro
gen bond donors. The group of Karlin further expanded this 
field to mononuclear cupric superoxide complexes.5 The 
study showed a correlation between the reactivity of the cu
pric superoxide complex and the number of hydrogen bond 
donors (Figure 1b.) In recent years, cobalt(III)peroxo (CoIII(O2)) com
plexes are increasingly attractive as models for metalO2 
complexes.
