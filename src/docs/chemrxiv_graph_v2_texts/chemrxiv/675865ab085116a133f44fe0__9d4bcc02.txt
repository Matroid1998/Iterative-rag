Description:
Has negative charge density delocalized about the surface fluorine atoms.

Small boron clusters have been touted for use as therapeutics and as precursors for boron
based nanomaterials.14 In particular, the closododecaborate cage species, (B12X12, 
X  H, F, Cl, Br, I), have attracted interest due to their extraordinary structural and electronic 
stability, which gives rise to a variety of interesting phenomena and promises application in areas 
such as energy storage, catalysis, and neutron capture cancer therapy.58 The B12X122 
(X  H, F, Cl, Br, I) dianions have quadruply degenerate gu symmetry cagecentred HOMOs that 
are predominantly localised on the boron cage framework..9 In the case of B12F122, the negative 
charge density is delocalized about the surface fluorine atoms, whereas larger halogenated 
analogues such as B12I122 have the negative charge delocalization contained within the boron 
cage.9 As a consequence of the delocalized excess electron charge density and the charge 
separation of ion pairs involving B12X122 species, dodecaborate dianions exhibit relatively weak 
electrostatic interactions in aqueous solution compared to more common dianions such as SO42 
and HPO42.

Description:
Has the lowest oxidation potential among halogenated B12X122 species.

Text:
Previous research of gasphase clusters containing B12X122 (XH, F, Cl, Br, I) demonstrated 
that the dodecaborate cages are prone to chargetransfer during collisioninduced dissociation and 
IR photodissociation owing to their relatively low oxidation potential.13 Of the halogenated 
B12X122 species, B12F122 has the lowest oxidation potential.14 With respect to B12F122, several 
studies have explored gas phase clustering interactions with a variety of ligands,13,1518 
demonstrating that electrostatic interactions are predominantly responsible for cluster
