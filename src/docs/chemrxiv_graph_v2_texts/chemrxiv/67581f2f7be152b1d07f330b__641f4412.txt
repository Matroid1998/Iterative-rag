Description:
An inert oxide with good thermal stability and high specific surface area, used to disperse metal nanoparticles.

Text:
With respect to the nature of the 
support, a considerable amount of literature has focused on reducible oxides, including TiO2 
and CeO2, because the presence of oxygen vacancies and the propensity of charge transfer from 
reducible support are thought to stabilize small Ru nanoparticles 21, 22. Far less attention has 
been paid to inert oxides, SiO2 in particular. Silica, a typically high specific surface area support 
with large pore volume, is particularly suited to disperse metal nanoparticles. SiO2 also has 
good thermal stability, which can help steer clear of support sintering or support overgrowth 
on Ru sites during catalyst preparation and methanation reaction. Nevertheless, silica
supported methanation catalysts are generally shown to be only moderately active, possibly 
due to the absence of oxygen vacancies and basicity 13, 22.
