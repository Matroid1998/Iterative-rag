Description:
Engineered into scaffolds for assembly using CTPR proteins.

Text:
The modules generally appear repeated in 
tandem, from 2 to 20 repeats, generating a rigid righthanded 
superhelical structure8 that is able to function as stable 
scaffold in both biological9, 10 and laboratory settings.11 Thus, 
CTPR proteins have been successfully used to build 
photoconductive 
and 
electroactive 
systems, 
combining 
covalent modification and noncovalent interactions, as well as 
stabilise fluorescent and electroactive clusters.1215 
In the current work, the CTPR proteins were engineered 
into scaffolds for C60 fullerene assembly.
