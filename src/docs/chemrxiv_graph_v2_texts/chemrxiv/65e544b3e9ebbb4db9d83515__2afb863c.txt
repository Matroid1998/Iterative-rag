containing functional group like conjugated carbonyl groups, arenes with electronwithdrawingmild 
electrondonating group, or benzene, is eligible for either typeRCIA reactions with excellent yields.1 
To expand the substrate scope of the RCIA reactions, we wonder whether functionalization of more 
broad inactivated alkenes via radical cation intermediates is feasible. This work (Figure 1) is to answer 
this important question critically with evidences. Figure 1. Type I, II RCIA reactions and the scientific question to address in this work
