Description:
A rare metal used in photocatalysts with potentially high turnover numbers.

Text:
With global demand for valueadded chemical products increasing each year, new catalytic 
materials must be developed to improve process efficiency. Many current processes require the 
use of intense reaction conditions, such as high pressure or temperature. Solar powered catalysts 
offer an attractive alternative or supplement to current processes. However, efficient 
photocatalytic materials typically require three characteristics high extinction coefficients, high 
photostability, and longlived photoexcited states. Many current photocatalysts are based on rare 
metals such as rhodium or iridium, which can have high turnover numbers depending on the 
specific reaction1,2. However, these compounds often do not have large absorption crosssections 
at   400 nm, which results in underutilization of the solar spectrum. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20237p9vkv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000298913259 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
