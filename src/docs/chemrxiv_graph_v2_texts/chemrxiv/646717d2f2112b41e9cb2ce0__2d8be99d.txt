Description:
Captures an electron from the electrode in an outer sphere reaction during ORR in alkaline solution.

Text:
For ORR in alkaline solution, it has been suggested that the initial 
and the rate determining step (RDS) is an outer sphere reaction, with O2 capturing an electron from 
the electrode.2122 For ORR on Au(100), such an outer sphere process has been examined 
systematically.2326 Nonetheless, the overall mechanism remains unclear and disputed.2728
