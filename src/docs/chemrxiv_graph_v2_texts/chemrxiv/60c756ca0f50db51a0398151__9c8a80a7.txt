Description:
A material used to etch cells for studying small volume measurements.

Text:
EC cells with picoliter 
volumes were studied by Clark et al., using cells etched in polystyrene 19. Small volume 
measurements have been realized in numerous ways over the years. Femto and attoliter cells 
were made by photolithographic processing on microchips 20. EC processes in femtoliter 
droplets have been studied for years through the transient current as they collide with a carbon 
microelectrode 21,22. Using recessed carbon electrodes in a nanopipette, a socalled 
nanosampler 23, Mirkin and coworkers could reach zeptoliter volumes and through 
generationcollection cycling study single molecule redox processes 24. However, it has been
