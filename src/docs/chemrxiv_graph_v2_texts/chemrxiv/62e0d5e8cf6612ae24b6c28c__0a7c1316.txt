Description:
A compound synthesized by a reversible reaction of graphite and Li ions, used in Li-ion secondary batteries.

Text:
Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have been extensively studied because of their 
unique physical properties. For example, LiC6, which can be synthesized by a reversible 
reaction of graphite and Li ions, is widely used in Liion secondary batteries 1,2. Moreover, superconductivity has been reported in several GICs with chemical formulae 
MC6 (M  Ca 3 , Sr 4, Ba 5, and Yb 6) and MC8 (M  K, Rb, and Cs 7). Figure 1 
shows the crystal structures and compositions of GICs reported experimentally under 
ambient pressure 814. The GICs are typically characterized by their stacking order and 
compositions. Three types of stacking structures (A, AA, and AAA stacking) have 
been reported for the MC6 composition.
