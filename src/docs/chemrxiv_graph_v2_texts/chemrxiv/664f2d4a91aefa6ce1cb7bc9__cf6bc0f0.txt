Description:
Mainly recycled industrially via mechanical recycling processes requiring high purity streams.

Text:
Plastics, currently produced 
at a scale of 400 million tons per year and projected to reach a 
yearly production capacity of 1 billion tons by 2050,1,2 lack 
sufficient endoflife options and are thus accumulating in the 
environment.3 Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are 
particularly challenging as they account for 452 of global 
plastic production and are largely used as shortlived 
packaging materials4 with limited recycling potential.58 
Currently, polyolefins are mainly recycled industrially via 
mechanical recycling processes, requiring high purity PE and 
PP streams. Nevertheless, in mechanical recycling, the product 
quality decreases with each recycling loop. This effect is 
attributed to the thermal and mechanical stress on the 
polymer during recycling, which can result in chain shorting.
