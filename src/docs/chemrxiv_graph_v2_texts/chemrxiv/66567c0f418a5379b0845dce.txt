Description:
The required starting materials for native chemical ligation (NCL).

Text:
Since the inception of NCL three decades ago,6,7 CPS has grown from a 
specialty technique into a field of its own, with dedicated international conferences8 as well as a 
10 
publicly available Protein Chemical Synthesis Database (PCSdb) with information on hundreds 
of synthesized proteins reported in literature.9 As the community grows and aims for larger and 
more diverse protein targets, the field needs data science tools to manage the complexity of 
information in a typical CPS project. The scope of CPS is continually widening thanks to many important chemical advances 
15 
over the years. Peptide thioesters, the required starting materials for NCL, can be readily 
produced by common FmocSPPS as masked thioester surrogates (most commonly hydrazides10
12).

Description:
Compounds used in protein synthesis with masked forms for convergent assembly.

Text:
Segments can be assembled into proteins convergently using a combination of masked 
thioesters and removable Cys protecting groups (e.g., Acm,13 Thz,14 and TfaThz15). Additional 
ligation sites beyond Cys have been unlocked by desulfurization reactions (originally converting 
20 
Cys to Ala16,17 but expanded to many thiolated aa3,18 including the commercially available 
thiovaline penicillamine19), as well as alternative ligation chemistries (e.g., serinethreonine 
ligation STL,20 ketoacidhydroxylamine ligation KAHA,21 diselenideselenoester ligation 
DSL22, and others2325). With a growing list of options in the modern protein chemists toolbox, 
a wide variety of proteins are now accessible; on the other hand, every synthetic approach 
25 
requires careful planning and consideration of available tools.
