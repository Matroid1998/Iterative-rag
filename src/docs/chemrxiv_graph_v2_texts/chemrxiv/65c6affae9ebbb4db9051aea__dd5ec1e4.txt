Description:
Undergoes oxidation with superior electrocatalytic activity yielding a low limit of detection.

Also, the
same researcher analyzed the performance of Copperbased materials for reduction reactions like (CO2, NO3) 6
to high valueadded products and these catalysts might be taken as an anode catalyst we believe. Furthermore,
Mouratib, R et al 7 showed a development of modified carbon paste electrode with a material that contains
high amount of AlandSi. This modified electrode was used as active catalyst for water treatment sludge (WTS)
for BisphenolA sensing. According to their manuscript, the prepared catalyst delivers superior electrocatalytic
activity toward the targeted reaction (oxidation of BisphenolA) which yields a low limit of detection as high as
0.1 M. In addition, Salhi, O et al 8 fabricated a poly1.8Diaminonaphtalene and cysteine modified black
carbon electrode (Poly1.8DANCysCB) for the determination of nitrite in real samples.
