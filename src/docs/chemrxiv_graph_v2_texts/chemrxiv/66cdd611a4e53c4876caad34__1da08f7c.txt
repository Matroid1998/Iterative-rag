Description:
Organo germanium compounds have longer and more labile germanium-carbon bonds.

Text:
For instance, tetracoordinate boron 
compounds possess a dative bond resulting in distorted tetrahedral geometry (17) and has 
potential lability. The longer as well as more labile germaniumcarbon bonds in organo 
germanium compounds feature an enlarged tetrahedral geometry (Fig 1A). (18) These 
differences render most current strategies for the constructing of C, S, P, and Si stereogenic 
centers inapplicable for their B and Ge congeners. Despite considerable efforts to explore the
