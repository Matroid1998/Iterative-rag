Description:
A nonproteinogenic amino acid that is a reversible inhibitor of DNA replication and has antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Text:
Mimosine, or bN(3hydroxy4oxypyridyl)aaminopropionic acid, is a nonproteinogenic amino
acid found in the members of Mimosoideae clade.1 It has been found to be a reversible inhibitor
of DNA replication because of its ability to strongly bind to metals in the active site of many
enzymes.2 Based on this activity, mimosine has been reported to have antimicrobial, antifungal3
and antiviral properties.4 Moreover, it has also found its way on therapeutic applications, showing
anticancer activity5 and antiinammatory properties.6
One of us recently proposed mimosine containing peptides as decorporation agents of Al(III),
a recognized neurotoxin.7 This proposal is based on the structural similarity of mimosine to de
feriprone (DFP), a drug used for Fe(II) removal that has also shown promising results on treating
the accumulation of highvalent metal cations,8 such as Al(III) and Fe(III).

Description:
A nonprotein amino acid studied for its influence on polypeptides using molecular dynamics simulations.

Text:
In this work we have studied the properties of mimosine and its inuence on polypeptides con
taining it using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD has become a standard tool
for the characterization of structural propensities of peptides and disordered proteins in aqueous
solution.11 However, for nonprotein amino acids like mimosine, parameters for running simula
