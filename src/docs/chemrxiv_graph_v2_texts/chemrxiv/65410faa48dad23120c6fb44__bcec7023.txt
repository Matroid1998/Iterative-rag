Description:
An element that forms the backbone of hydrogen-passivated zigzag graphene nanoribbons.

We choose trimethylenemethane
(TMM) as the organic radical and hydrogenpassivated ZGNR having six carbon atoms along the width (6ZGNRH).49
TMM has been widely investigated both experimentally and theoretically.5055 Similarly, 6ZGNRH can be synthesized
experimentally with a bottomup approach using a molecular precursor.56,57 Using first principle calculations, we
have studied the interaction of the TMM radical (shown in Figure 1) with the 6ZGNRH surface in the different
configurations as shown in Figure 6. We begin with the description of the electronic structure, and magnetic and
transport properties of TMMadsorbed 6ZGNRH in comparison to the pristine 6ZGNRH. Our results demonstrate
that the TMM is either chemisorbed or physisorbed on the 6ZGNRH surface depending on the adsorption site or
configurations.
