Description:
Complexes with highly axial crystal fields have favorable single-molecule magnet properties.

Text:
Singlemolecule magnets (SMMs) have potential applications in highdensity data storage as 
they can show magnetic memory effects, and lanthanide SMMs have shown the best 
performance to date.13 It is wellestablished that Dy(III) complexes with highly axial crystal 
fields have favorable SMM properties, as these ligand arrangements stabilize the most 
magnetic mJ states, while simultaneously destabilizing the least magnetic mJ states to give large
