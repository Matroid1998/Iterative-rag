Description:
Catalyst with very fast kinetics for hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions in acidic electrolyte.

Text:
Alkaline membrane electrolyzer and fuel cell technologies are attractive alternatives to their
more mature acidic counterparts. Alkaline conditions are advantageous for the electrocatal
ysis of the oxygen electrode reactions, but the opposite holds for the hydrogen electrode.13
In acidic electrolyte, the kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR
and HER) on platinum catalyst are very fast, thus enabling ultralow platinum loadings
