Description:
Compounds containing transition metals with potential applications in catalysis, biological research, and nanomaterials.

Over the past few decades, the Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) containing transition metals 
have garnered increased interest due to their potential applications in various fields, including 
catalysis, biologicalmedical research, nanomaterials, luminescence, and liquid crystal studies 
1,2. Among these, silver(I)NHC complexes play a crucial role as carbene transfer agents in 
the creation of other transition and inner transition metalcarbene systems 3. The stability of 
NHC compounds is maintained by inductive and mesomeric effects, which make the lone pair 
of electrons on the carbene carbon more accessible for coordination 4. This distinct electronic 
structure offers significant bonding characteristics with transition metals, whose vacant d
orbitals are readily available for incoming electrons during complex formation 5.
