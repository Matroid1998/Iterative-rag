Description:
Cleaved by an enzyme to release glyoxylates.

Previous studies have proposed 
that this microbial utilization of PEGs occurs through endgroup specific (i.e., exolytic) oxida
tion reactions catalyzed by three intracellular enzymes an alcohol dehydrogenase, which con
verts the terminal alcohols into aldehydes; an aldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes the al
dehydes to carboxylic acids; and, finally, an ether bondcleaving enzyme (e.g., ahydroxy acid 
dehydrogenase), which acts on the carboxylic end groups releasing glyoxylates, thereby short
ening the PEG chain by one unit.1014 The glyoxylates are then further metabolized to CO2.
