Description:
A metabolic intermediary produced in purine degradation and a precursor in the synthesis of uric acid.

Text:
Xanthine (3,7dihydropurine2,6dione) is a member of the purine family and consists of fused 
five and sixmembered, heterocyclic rings (Figure 1a). This chemical skeleton is shared with 
other purines such as guanine10 (Figure 1b) and adenine11. Xanthine itself is a metabolic 
intermediary produced in purine degradation and a precursor in the synthesis of uric acid. It 
can therefore be found widely in organisms and their waste products. Recently, xanthine has 
also been found in the form of preferentially oriented layers of biocrystals appearing to back
reflect light into receptors in the median ocellus in the Archaeognatha insect group12,13. Given 
that the majority of biogenic crystals are made of guanine, it is currently unclear why xanthine 
may sometimes be found instead13.

Description:
Forms crystals with distinct optical properties.

Understanding the structure of xanthine crystals will give 
insight into its role and optical properties and how this might differ from guanine crystal 
function, providing a greater understanding of why xanthine may form preferentially over 
guanine. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024tlgvb ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000254348673 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
