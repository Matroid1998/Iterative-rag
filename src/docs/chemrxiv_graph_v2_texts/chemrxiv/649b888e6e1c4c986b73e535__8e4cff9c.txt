Description:
A gas with a boiling point of 77 K.

Text:
It was also a cuprate that was discovered with a critical
temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77
K). This led to the realization that applications of super
conductivity were looking more realistic and feasible in the
near future 6. Superconductors with a critical temperature
above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen are called high
temperature superconductors. It is important to note that all
hightemperature superconductors are typeII superconductors. To date, cuprate superconductors hold the record for the
