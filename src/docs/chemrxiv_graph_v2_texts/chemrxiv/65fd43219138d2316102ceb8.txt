Description:
Approved by the FDA for fluorescence-guided resection of tumors and used in photodynamic therapy.

It was also demonstrated that BBB stability in lowergrade gliomas is better than that in
GBM.8 As the degree of BBB disruption differs with the malignancy of the tumor, treatment of
lowgrade brain tumors is still a challenging task, because of the presence of almost intact BBB.9
Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 5aminolevulinic
acid (5ALA) for fluorescenceguided resection (FGR) of tumors rehabilitated interests in
leveraging this agent as a means to administer photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT treatment to
the tumor resection cavity can minimize the risk of local reappearance.10 PDT involves the
photoactivation of a photosensitizer molecule called a photosensitizer, which is selectively
incorporated into tumor cells.
