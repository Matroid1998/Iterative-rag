Description:
Functionally diverse nonracemic compounds important for chemical synthesis.

Text:
Furthermore, the welldefined exit 
vectors of these rigid cycloalkanes make them ideal as scaffold can
didates through which to probe distinct spatial environments, par
ticularly through their deployment as single enantiomers.2 As a result 
of these properties, the preparation of functionally diverse nonrace
mic aminomethylcyclopropanes (AMCPs) and aminomethylcy
clobutanes (AMCBs) represents an important challenge for chemi
cal synthesis.

Description:
Important compounds in the synthesis of complex variants of substituted strained cycloalkanes.

Text:
Baran and Reisman have shown, independently, that reactivity 
augmenting auxiliarydirected CH arylation can be leveraged for 
the synthesis of di and trisubstituted cyclobutane derivatives.8 Fi
nally, Davies and coworkers reported a nondirected CH arylation 
of arylcyclobutanes through the reaction of catalyticallygenerated 
Rhcarbenoids.9 Considering the demonstrated importance of ami
nomethylcyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, harnessing the native 
tertiary amine functionality to direct CH transformations on the 
ring framework would provide a powerful tool for the streamlined 
synthesis of complex variants of these substituted strained cycloal
kanes.
