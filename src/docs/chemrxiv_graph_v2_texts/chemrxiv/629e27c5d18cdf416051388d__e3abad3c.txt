Description:
Electron-withdrawing groups that influence tautomeric forms.

Text:
On the contrary, with electronwithdrawing 
fluororganyl groups, only the P(III) tautomer was isolated and detected spectroscopically, 
and in some cases, a solventdependent equilibrium was observed between the 
tautomeric forms.610 
Although the reactivity of phosphinylidenes suggests the presence of both oxide and 
acid tautomers, the direct intramolecular proton transfer (PT) for their interconversion is 
unfavorable at room temperature due to its high activation barrier of  60 kcal mol1.1115 
Alternatively, an intermolecular PT mechanism between two tautomers of the same 

3 
species,16 a base or watercatalyzed PT has been proposed.11,14,15,17 Recently, a 
detailed computational study on the tautomerization of simple secondary phosphine 
oxides predicted that the twowater bridged PT provides the most energetically favorable 
path in the gas phase, as compared to intra and intermolecular PT involving one, two, or 
three tautomers.12
