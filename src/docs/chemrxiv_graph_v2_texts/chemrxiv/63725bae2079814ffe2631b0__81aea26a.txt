Materials capable of carrying out the separation of molecules by selective adsorption of CO2.

Recently, 
transition metal carbides (TMCs) and their twodimensional (2D) versions, MXenes, have been 
proposed as suited materials capable of carrying out the separation of both molecules by selective 
adsorption of CO2.4,5 Their use implies having the material eventually saturated by CO2, though, 
so posterior regenerating processes are needed. Here, materials that allow for a continuous 
separation without regeneration interruption steps would be better adequate. Related to the previous, 2D porous membranes are gaining some popularity for selective 
diffusion processes. For instance, promising results have been achieved in studies on graphene
