Description:
A crystalline lattice that can incorporate lanthanide ions through ion-beam implantation.

Text:
However, its still unclear whether large number 
of lantanide ions can be dispersed in ZnO crystalline lattice or the ions can only segregate into 
crystalline lanthanide oxide due to large charge and radius of trivalent lanthanide ion. Such 
thermodynamically nonequilibrium method as ionbeam implantation results in the 
incorporation of lanthanide ions in ZnO crystalline lattice with its subsequent out diffusion and 
segregation upon heat treatment 14,15. That fact also raises a question whether the 
luminescent lanthanide centers located in ZnO matrix or at interface between zinc and lanthanide 
oxides 79. This work is a followup of our previous article on ZnO single crystal growth via spontaneous 
crystallization from hightemperature melts under high pressure 16.

Description:
Exhibits strong luminescence in the UV and visible ranges.

Text:
In that work, the grown 
ZnO single crystals (up to several millimeters) exhibited strong luminescence in the UV and 
visible ranges. In the present work, the crystal growth method was adapted for growing a mixture 
of poly and single crystals of ZnO and Yb2O3, and the recovered samples were studied by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Xray diffraction and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS
