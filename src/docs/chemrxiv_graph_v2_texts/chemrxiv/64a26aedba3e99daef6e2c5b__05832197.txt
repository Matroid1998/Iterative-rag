Description:
The nucleotide-activated form of Kdo8N3 processed inside the bacterial cytosol.

Text:
Several studies have used 
this modified Kdo substrate to metabolically label LPS in a selection of Gramnegative bacteria (Figure 
1).9,1318 Labeling experiments involve the uptake of Kdo8N3 inside the bacterial cytosol, where it is 
processed to the nucleotideactivated CMPKdo8N3 form. Next, Kdotransferase adds Kdo8N3 to the 
growing lipid A structure, after which the glycoconjugate is flipped to the extracellular surface. A 
subsequent click reaction with a fluorescent label allows the visualization of labeled LPS structures 
using SDSPAGE gel imaging and fluorescence microscopy on whole cells.
