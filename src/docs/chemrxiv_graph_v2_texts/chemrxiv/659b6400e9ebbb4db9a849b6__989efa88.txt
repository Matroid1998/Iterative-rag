Description:
Acts as a photoblocker to fine-tune printing resolution.

Following debinding 
in air and sintering in a reducing atmosphere, the resulting copper 
architectures exhibit a minimum feature size of approximately 40 
m, accompanied by a high twin density and substantial copper 
content 
(96.2 
wt). The 
microstructure 
of 
copper 
is 
microcrystalline and compact, featuring an average grain size of 
6.5 m and 4.6  2.2 twins per grain. These findings underscore 
the powerful capability of this methodology in creating micro
architected 3D metal structures. A waterbased photoresin was developed, comprising 
sodium acrylate as an ionexchangeable monomer, polyethylene 
glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) as a crosslinker, PEGBAPO26 as a 
highly efficient waterborne photoinitiator, tartrazine as a photo
blocker to finetune printing resolution27, and cellulose 
nanocrystals (CNCs) as a toughening agent28 (Figure 1b).
