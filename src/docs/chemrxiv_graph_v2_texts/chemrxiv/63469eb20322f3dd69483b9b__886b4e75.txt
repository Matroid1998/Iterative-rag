Description:
Formed under primordial conditions.

Text:
The formation of carboxylic acids and in particular of 
AcOH under primordial conditions is well known.14a, 15  We 
propose that formation of iron(II)species (Fe(OAc)2) and 
coordination of amino acidspeptides lead to an iron(II)complex 
mediated coupling step (exemplified for the coupling of amino 
acids Figure 1a and b, Scheme S1).
