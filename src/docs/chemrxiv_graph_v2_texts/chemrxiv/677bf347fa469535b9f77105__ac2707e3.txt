Description:
A formulation containing paclitaxel used in cancer treatment.

Text:
PAAm was selected for its high watersolubility, biocompatibility and stealth properties,21 and 
we applied this approach to paclitaxel (Ptx), a highly hydrophobic and vesicant anticancer drug 
used in the formulation of Taxol, as a proof to validate our strategy. The obtained PtxPAAm 
prodrugs enabled safe SC injection without inducing local toxicity and outperformed Taxol 
during efficacy study in tumorbearing mice, due to a higher maximum tolerated dose (MTD).20 
However, the robustness and the versatility of this strategy, and therefore its future 
potential for drug delivery, depend primarily on its applicability to other irritantvesicant drugs.
