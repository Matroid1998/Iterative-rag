Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier that
has significant potential to decarbonize eco
nomic sectors that produce diiculttoabate
emissions, including heavy duty transportation
(maritime shipping, rail, longhaul trucks), avi
ation, high temperature industrial applications
(chemicals, steel making), seasonal grid storage,
etc.1 Yet the lack of the demonstrated commer
cial progress todate mainly stems from signif
icant technical challenges related to the stor
age, transportation, and generation of green hy
drogen.2,3 In terms of hydrogen storage, inter
