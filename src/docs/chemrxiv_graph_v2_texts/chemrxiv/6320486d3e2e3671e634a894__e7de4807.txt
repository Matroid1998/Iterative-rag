Epoxyresin thermosets are known for their tunable and superior thermomechanical properties,1
3 making them suitable for a range of technological applications. Most notably, epoxies are used 
as adhesives4 and coatings5 in the automotive industry, as well as matrix materials in various 
composites.6 Their thermomechanical properties are determined by their covalently crosslinked 
molecular structure, which forms during the socalled curing or crosslinking process. During the 
curing process, typically a (liquid) mixture of epoxy prepolymer and socalled hardener molecules 
reacts chemically to yield the final cured epoxy material. An example of such chemical reactions 
is shown in Scheme 1 for aminebased hardeners. For typical aminebased hardeners, the curing 
reaction proceeds via an addition reaction between an epoxide and a primary amine to give a 
hydroxyl group and a secondary amine.
