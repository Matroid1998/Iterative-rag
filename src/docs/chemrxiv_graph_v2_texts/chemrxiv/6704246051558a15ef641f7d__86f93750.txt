Description:
Elements where the d-electron contribution is a major factor in scaling relations of binding energies.

Text:
(2011) demonstrated that several C2 species on
closepacked and stepped surfaces obey these linear trends well.8
Kolb et al. (2021) focused on closedpack surfaces only and also
observed linear scaling relationships between the binding energies
of C and CHx species.9 Such scaling relations have been rational
ized using a dband model7 through a separation of sp and d
electron contributions to the binding energy. Specically, the sp
electron contribution is expected to remain constant for a surface
made of different transition metals, while the delectron contribu
tion is deemed the major factor underneath the scaling relations. However, more detailed analysis is needed to further understand
the quantum chemical origins of these intriguing scaling relations
governing the binding energies.
