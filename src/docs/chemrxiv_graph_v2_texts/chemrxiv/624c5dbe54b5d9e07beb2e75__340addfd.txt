Description:
Used in small molecule activation systems that mitigate deleterious properties of transition metal-based systems.

Text:
However, in 
recent times, small molecule activation by boronbased systems 
have emerged as an area of considerable attention as the boron 
systems are more available and most importantly those mitigate 
the deleterious properties of transition metalbased systems.6 In 
2016, Martin and coworkers reported the activation of BH bond 
of pinacolborane and NH bond of aniline by nonmetal boron 
containing pentaphenylborole moiety.7 These crucial insights 
have allowed us for the development of metal free boron based 
catalyst to activate the BH and NH bonds in ammoniaborane 
(H3NBH3, AB) molecule.

Description:
Has high Lewis acidity, especially when attached to electronegative atoms.

Text:
reported that a metal 
free boron based 9,10dichlorodiboraanthracene (bisborane) (1ClCl) 
catalyst releases more than 2 equivalents of H2 per equivalent of AB 
at 60 0C in the presence of 14 mixture of THFdiglyme (Dg) solvent 
(Scheme 1).16 The high efficiency involved in the catalytic AB 
dehydrogenation process may be attributed to the high Lewis acidity 
of the two boron centres attached with electronegative Cl atoms which 
promotes BH activation of the AB system. Incidentally, the presence 
of two Lewis acidic sites and a definite geometry of bidentate boron 
based Lewis acid catalyst make it distinct from the other monoboron 
based Lewis acids in terms of high catalytic activity.
