Description:
Oxidized in aqueous aerosol droplets as a main source of sulfate in the atmosphere.

Text:
The reactions in aerosol phase can play a key role in atmospheric chemistry.13 The oxidation
of SO2 in aqueous aerosol droplets is one of main sulfate sources in atmosphere, because of the
fast kinetics of aqueousphase sulfur oxidations.46 Large Criegee intermediates can survive
at airwater interfaces, while water is also their major sink, allowing them to react with
other species.7,8 The aqueous droplets can mediate the efficient production of atmospheric
formic acid from gaseous formaldehyde.9,10 Furthermore, particlephase oxidation reactions
