Description:
Reacts with CO2 to yield CO and H2O in the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Besides its use as a probe molecule in the field of Surface Science, 
it is also used a reactant, e.g., in the FischerTropsch (FT) process, generating hydrocarbons 
from COH2 mixtures 10, a key ingredient for the carbon circular economy when CO is 
generated from previously captured and dissociated carbon dioxide (CO2). Aside, CO is a 
sought product, for instance, through the reverse water gas shift reaction, where CO2 can be 
revalued by reacting with H2 to yield CO and H2O (CO2  H2  CO  H2O, Hr
o  41 
kJmol1) 11, with the concomitant environmental implications in the fight against global 
warming and climate change. Apart from these, the CO molecule can be a key intermediate, 
e.g.
