Description:
A component of the Arizona solvent system L1 used in liquid-liquid chromatography.

Text:
CPC is
consequently referred to as a liquidliquid chromatographic technique given its conceptual sim
ilarity to chromatography methods that utilize a solid stationary phase. Recently, CPC (and a
similar method, countercurrent chromatography) has shown promise as an effective and scalable
approach for separating bioproduct mixtures to advance the renewable chemical industry.15,17,18
Alherech et al.15 successfully employed a twostage CPC strategy for isolating five aromatic prod
ucts from the alkaline oxidative depolymerization of CuAHP lignin by utilizing solvent mix
tures comprising pentaneethyl acetatemethanolwater (i.e., Arizona solvent system L1) and
dichloromethanemethanolwater.
