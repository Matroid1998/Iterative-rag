Description:
An inert gas that poses a challenge to fixation despite being thermodynamically feasible for conversion to NH3.

Text:
The artificial fixation of nitrogen by 
Haber and Bosch had ushered in sustenance of the 
everincreasing population by facilitating production 
of NH3 as a chemical feedstock for fertilizer synthesis 
from aerial N2 1. Although it is hailed as one of the 
greatest discoveries of mankind, over the past few 
decades researchers had invested their efforts to 
unearth 
more 
benign 
routes 
through 
solar, 
electrochemical for N2 conversion to NH3 2 as the 
commercial production of NH3 is associated with 
significant carbon footprint3. The inertness of N2 
poses an unassailable challenge to its fixation 
regardless of the fact that N2 conversion to NH3 is a 
thermodynamically feasible process (Gof (298 K) of 
NH3 (from N2 and H2) is 16.4 kJmol).

Description:
Reduced to N2H4 as the only nitrogenous product by Ni3S82.

was the first to reverse the 
trend, forming N2H4NH3 in the ratio of 241 19. Of 
late a remarkable finding was reported by Dey and co
workers wherein they have developed the first 
molecular complex Ni3S82 which reduces N2 to 
N2H4 
as 
the 
only 
nitrogenous 
product 
electrochemically 20. The intermediates involved in the catalytic mechanism 
have not been identified and the underlying 
mechanism 
was 
unclear 
from 
the 
reported 
experimental findings. Furthermore, there are hardly 
any precedents of NRR by Ni. The situation is 
complicated due to competing NRR and HER 
(Hydrogen evolution reaction) at similar reduction 
potentials 21. Hence it presents a wonderful 
opportunity for theoretical comprehension of the 
mechanistic roadmap of this intriguing and unique 
Scheme 1 Reaction studied in this work. 2
