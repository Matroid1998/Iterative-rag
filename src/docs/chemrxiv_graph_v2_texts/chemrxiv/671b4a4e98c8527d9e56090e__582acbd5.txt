Description:
Used to synthesize oligoguanylic acids on the poly(C) template.

One of the first successful examples of nonenzymatic RNA
selfreplication was demonstrated by Lohrmann and Orgel in
1980 16, in which they used guanosine5phosphoroimidazo
lides to synthesize oligoguanylic acids on the poly(C) tem
plate. Unlike nucleotide triphosphates, phosphoroimida
zolides proved to offer much higher reactivity and enabled the
socalled primer extension reaction with the catalytic support
of Pb2 and Zn2 cations 16. This process was improved
a year later by applying a more reactive 2methylimidazole
activating group instead of imidazole 17,18. However, this
improvement did not resolve the original challenge of copy
ing adenosine and uridine, which almost completely blocked
further RNA strand synthesis. Enzymefree replication of nu
cleic acids has been extensively studied by numerous groups
since then.
