Description:
Reagents that have emerged as aryne precursors during ortho deprotonation-elimination.

Text:
Aryl onium reagents have emerged as aryne precur
sors during a resurgence of methods based on ortho
deprotonationelimination (Scheme 1b).713 These aryne 
precursors include those based on halogen leaving groups 
such as iodonium,7,8,12,1418 bromonium,9,19 and chloroni
um,10,19 as well as chalcogen leaving groups such as sul
fonium and oxonium (Scheme 1b).11,13,20,21 In several cases, 
these onium leaving groups permit the use of mild bases 
such as potassium and cesium carbonate and potassium 
phosphate to generate arynes,7,9,10,12,13,19,22 and these ap
proaches rival or even exceed the functional group com
patibility of fluorideinduced aryne generation of o
trimethylsilyl triflates.7 Although aryl onium reagents 
have provided a mild way to generate arynes via deproto
nation, they have not universally improved the generality 
and efficiency of accessing arynes.
