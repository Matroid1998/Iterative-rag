Description:
Helicenes that include heteroatoms such as N, O, and S in their structure.

Text:
A common feature in many helicenes mentioned above is 
the inclusion of a heteroatom into the helical backbone.30 This 
is often highlighted by studies as crucial in influencing the 
physical and optoelectronic properties of a helicene.13,3133 
However, there are relatively few studies dedicated solely 
towards investigating synthetic strategies for making a wider 
range of heterohelicenes based on N, O, and Sheterocycles. Existing examples include photochemical methodologies as 
applied to the synthesis of azahelicenes by the Carrona 
group34,35 and a variety of thiahelicenes synthesised by the 
Wynberg group.3638 Mallory photocyclisations39 are one of the 
most common strategies to access heterohelicenes but non
photochemical methodologies such as the Scholl reaction,4042 
oxidative couplings,43 and 222 cycloisomerisations4446 have 
also been reported.

Description:
Compounds synthesized using photochemical flow reactors through Mallory photocyclisation.

Text:
Flow or photoflow methodologies are an oftenoverlooked 
synthetic strategy for accessing heterohelicenes. In particular, 
photoflow chemistry may offer advantages over batch 
chemistry including straightforward scalability and a higher 
tolerance for the high dilution and potential photodegradation 
encountered in Mallory photocyclisations.47,48 Some examples 
of helicenes and heterohelicenes synthesised in flow have been 
reported such as the 222 cycloisomerisations mentioned 
above, but only a handful of these explore the preparation of 
heterohelicenes by photocyclisation.4953 
In this work, we report the Mallory photocyclisation of a 
series of heterohelicenes using a photochemical flow reactor. Most substrates were synthesised within a short 100 s 
residence time by using a powerful 150 W LED 365 nm lamp, 
enabling throughputs of up to 195 mg of stilbene per hour.
