Description:
In their trivalent form (Ln3), they are known for characteristic optical and magnetic properties.

Text:
Lanthanides in their trivalent form (Ln3) are well known for their 
characteristic optical (and also magnetic) properties. The specific 
electronic configuration 4fn5s25p6 (n 014) when zerovalent, in 
which the 4f inner shell is well shielded by the 5s and 5p orbitals, 
gives rise to longlived excited states with sharp 4f emission bands 
that span from the nearinfrared (NIR) to the visible and UV regions. These optimal photoluminescence properties account for their 
application in medical imaging,13 telecommunications,46 light 
emitting devices7 and solar energy harvesting810 among other 
areas.11 
Ln 
ions 
have 
the 
major 
drawback 
that 
their 
intraconfigurational ff electronic transitions are mostly forbidden by 
the selection rules, resulting in very low absorption coefficients.
