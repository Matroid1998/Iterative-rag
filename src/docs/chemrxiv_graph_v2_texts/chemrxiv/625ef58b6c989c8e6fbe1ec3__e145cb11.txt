Description:
A gas transported by blood from every part of the human body.

Text:
Bloodstain TSD is typically estimated by modelling the physicochemical degradation of 
78 
blood biomolecules over time; experimental methodologies generating spectroscopic 79, genetic 1012 
79 
and photographic 13,14 metrics have been developed and used to estimate bloodstain TSD. Factors like 
80 
individual variation, type of substrate and environmental conditions influence the timewise degradation 
81 
of bloodstains and their biomolecules, resulting in large variability in the accuracy and precision of TSD 
82 
estimation models 1,15,16. 83 
Blood is a nonNewtonian fluid responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis in vivo by providing 
84 
transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, minerals, and electrolytes, among others, to and from every part of 
85 
the human body.
