Description:
Forms part of the cation in 1,1(1,10 decanedyl)bis1,1,1trihexyl chloride, linked by a (CH2)10 alkyl chain.

6, these compounds kill bacteria (i.e., not only inhibit them),
and the bactericidal action is fast, taking between 15 to 30 minutes to kill drugresistant strains
of Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Escherichia coli. Among the tested species, 1,1(1,10
decanedyl)bis1,1,1trihexyl chloride (DxC10Cl2), whose DxC102 cation is made of two
trihexyl phosphonium ions joined by a (CH2)10 alkyl chain (see Fig. 1), presented the strongest
bactericidal activity, together with the weakest (or at least the slowest) cytotoxicity. These
appealing properties stand out in comparison with those of similar compounds.
