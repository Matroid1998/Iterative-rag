thermoplastics can be prepared via different (typically 
polycondensation) methods, these often require 
expensive 
or 
highly 
reactive 
reagents, 
only 
incorporate 
low 
amounts 
of 
sulfur 
or 
yield 
oligomers.27 Given the cyclic structure of S8, one 
might imagine that ringopening polymerisation 
would be suitable to produce polysulfur Sn, however 
this process is thermodynamically unfavourable at 
ambient condition (floor temperature 159 C) and 
requires copolymerisation techniques to obtain stable 
polymers.28
