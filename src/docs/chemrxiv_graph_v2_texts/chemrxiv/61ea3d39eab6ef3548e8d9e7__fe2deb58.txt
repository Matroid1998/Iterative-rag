Description:
A low molecular weight oligomer that is fully soluble in organic solvents.

Text:
The copolymer made 
66 
from these building blocksreferred to here as poly(Srlimonene)is a low molecular weight 
67 
oligomer that is fully soluble in organic solvents.28 This solubility is useful, for instance, in using 
68 
the polymer to coat surfaces.28, 29 Additionally, at high concentrations of inorganic mercury, the 
69 
polymer changes colour from red to yellowa chromogenic response with potential use in 
70 
mercury sensing or for filtration media that changes colour when it needs to be replaced.28 
71 
Building upon these foundational studies, the Hasell lab expanded access to this polymer and 
72 
its utility in mercury remediation.
