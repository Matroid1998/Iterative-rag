Description:
Elements known for their unique intrinsic magnetic and photophysical properties.

Text:
There is considerable interest in the discovery of new lanthanide (Ln)containing 
materials due to their unique, intrinsic magnetic and photophysical properties and the desire to 
design functional Lnmaterials for specific applications.1, 2 This is typically achieved via the 
judicious choice of an organic ligand with desirable properties, to generate hybrid 
(organicinorganic) materials, where the ligand can influence which lanthanide property(ies) 
are expressed.

Description:
Complexes with pyrazolylborate ligands that display single molecule magnet properties and sensitized Ln3 emission.

Text:
In particular, lanthanide complexes with pyrazolylborate ligands, are of interest 
to researchers as they display single molecule magnet properties,3, 4 sensitized Ln3 emission5, 
6 as well as CH activation catalysis.79 Lanthanide pyrazolylborate complexes, despite their 
promising chemical and physical properties, are still relatively underexplored, with only a 
limited range of pyrazolylborates used.10, 11 
Pyrazolylborates are pyrazolesubstituted derivatives of the borohydride, BH4 ion, 
discovered by Trofimenko over 50 years ago.12 Trispyrazolylborate (Tp), where three of the 
four hydrides are replaced by pyrazole rings, is the most wellstudied type of pyrazolylborate 
owing to its strong chelating ability.
