Description:
Forms shape-persistent nanorings and macrocycles with extended conjugated electron systems.

Text:
Synthesis of shapepersistent carbon nanorings or carbonbased macrocycles containing 
extended conjugated electron systems has fascinated chemists due to their unique molecular 
geometry and the associated characteristic properties.1 The increasing importance of carbonrich 
compound as materials has caused this area grow and expand into an interdisciplinary area.2 Among 
the synthetic studies of such compounds, the synthesis of pphenylene compounds with various 
geometries has attracted attention, as represented by the chemistry of cycloparaphenylene molecules.3 
Recent examples of such compounds with a unique geometry include molecules with motifs including 
spoked wheels,4 cages,5 trihelicates,6 lemniscates,7 Mbius loops,8 catenane and trefoil knots.9 We 
also reported on a pphenylene molecule with an Sshaped geometry, as demonstrated by the synthesis 
of the linear 3spirobifluorenylene 1 consisting of the three spirobifluorene units, where the 
stereochemistry of 1 is RPRSMS (Figure 1a).10 
In the present study, we focused on the structural motif of the woven pattern found in 
textiles.11 Figure 1b shows typical examples of triaxial and diaxial weave patterns.

Description:
Forms the backbone of chiral nanorings constructed by cyclic connection of spirobifluorene.

Text:
The designed chiral 
carbon nanorings 2n are constructed by the cyclic connection of spirobifluorene with the same 
chirality, i.e., RRR or SSS (Figure 1c). The structures also can be viewed as macrocycles with helically
