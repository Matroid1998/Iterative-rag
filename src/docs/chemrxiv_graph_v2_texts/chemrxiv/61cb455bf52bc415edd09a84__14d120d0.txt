2.2Paracyclophane (cyclophanyl; PCP) is is a prevalent 3D scaffold of intriguing structural and 
electronic properties which exhibits planar chirality upon substitution and is therfore widely 
investigated in asymmetric synthesis as planar chiral ligands, catalysts, chiroptical, and optoelectronic 
materials.6,7 PCPderived materials dealing with planar chirality and throughspace conjugation have 
been the subject of comprehensive research.8,9 PCP and derivatives have previously been used in 
polymer chemistry for the preparation of stacked conjugated polymers by employing 
electrochemical, transition metalcatalyzed coupling reactions or various polycondensation 
approaches.10,11
