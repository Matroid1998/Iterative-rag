Description:
A material studied for its wetting properties with water and polymer resins.

Text:
MD has been used to study the wetting 
properties of water and polymer resins on graphite and metallic surfaces 1725. Recently, 
Bamane et. al. 26 used MD to study the wettability of highperformance polymer systems on 
aromatic carbon surfaces to determine relative levels of processibility of carbon nanotube 
composites. Thus far, wetting properties of polymer resin systems on BNNT surfaces have not 
been computationally studied. Therefore, to take full advantage of the excellent properties of 
BNNT in nanocomposites, and establish the most compatible resins with BNNTs, MDbased 
procedures to predict the wettability of various resin systems on BNNT surfaces need to be 
developed and validated.
