Description:
Few examples exhibit luminescence properties.

Accordingly, the fluorescence emission of 
N,Nhexyl7,7diazaisoindigo (13 in Scheme 1) increases in viscous solvents because 
the bond rotation slows down 8. N,NOctyl7,7diazaisoindigo (14) is also capable of 
forming an gel with aggregationinduced enhanced emission (AIEE) 9. Thus, the 
rotation around the C7C7 bond in the excited state would be hindered inside the gel 
matrix enhancing the radiative decay of the molecule 9. Despite the few examples of 7,7diazaisoindigos with luminescence properties, 
we have found that the incorporation of triphenylamine (TPA) subunits at 5,5positions 
leads to a strong increase of the fluorescence emission. The aim of this work is to delve
