Description:
Used as a bioorthogonal handle in click chemistry for immobilization.

Text:
In this approach the FFFs are used as the compound set in a 
chemoproteomicenabled phenotypic screen.4 Any fragments eliciting the desired phenotype 
are then incubated in the assay system (usually cultured cells) and irradiated with UV light. This results in the formation of a covalent adduct between the FFF and its molecular target. Interacting targets are enriched from the assay system using the bioorthogonal handle. In 
the Cravatt approach, the bioorthogonal handle is an acetylene; click chemistry allows 
immobilisation to a bead either directly or through a high affinity tag such as biotin. The 
specificity of any interaction can be assured by carrying out a competitive control (FFF co
incubated with a nonphotoaffinity analogue, in this case an acetamide analogue).
