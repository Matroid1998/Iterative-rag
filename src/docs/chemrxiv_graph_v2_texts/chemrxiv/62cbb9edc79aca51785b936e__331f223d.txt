Description:
Groups incorporated into the oxide lattice from water vapor, activating proton conduction.

Protonconducting oxides15 have attracted considerable attention as a prominent candidate 
for the electrolyte of solid oxide fuel cells and other electrochemical devices6. This class of 
materials, discovered by Iwahara et al. in the early 1980s1, uniquely incorporates hydroxyl 
groups into the oxide lattice from water vapor, activating proton conduction3, 7, 8. Because of 
their high proton conductivities at the intermediate temperatures of 400600 C, Sc and Y
doped barium zirconates containing dopants of 60 and 20 at, respectively4, 5, are promising 
as electrolytes for intermediatetemperature electrochemical devices that require neither 
precious metal catalysts typically used in polymerelectrolytemembrane systems or costly 
heatresistant alloys used in balanceofplant components of hightemperature solid oxide 
electrochemical cells.
