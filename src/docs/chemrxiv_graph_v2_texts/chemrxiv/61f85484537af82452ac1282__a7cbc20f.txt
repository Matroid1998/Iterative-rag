Description:
A metal ion of interest for replacement due to its rich oxidation chemistry, low toxicity, and relative abundance.

Therefore, we need to need explore other alternatives.1,4 A number of transition metal 
ions are of particular interest in the replacement of Pb2 due to their rich oxidation chemistry, 
low toxicity, and relative abundance.3,5 In fact, computational screening studies predict that 
HOIPs containing metal ions such as Mg2, V2, Mn2, and Ni2 are likely to function as direct 
bandgap semiconductors and are good candidates for replacing Pb2ions.6 However these 
predictions have not been experimentally verified. Herein, we study the optical and structural 
properties of methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) films with varying degrees of Ni2 
substitution. We show that the threedimensional (3D) perovskite structure is maintained with 
increasing ratios of NiI2 of up to 30 Ni2.
