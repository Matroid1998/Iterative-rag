Description:
A gaseous signalling molecule endogenously produced in mammals to regulate cellular functions.

Text:
Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signalling molecule endogenously 
produced in mammals to regulate cellular functions with a vast 
impact on several physiological processes including vasodilation, 
neurotransmission, and immunity, among others.1,2 In the 
physiological environment, NO is a highly reactive gas that 
readily diffuses across cell membranes and tissues in the body. In addition, its biological activity is tissuespecific and dose
dependent, being toxic at high concentrations.

Description:
A molecule with ubiquitous physiological activity in humans, produced endogenously from Larginine.

Text:
Consequently, 
NO is endogenously produced on the target site, at the specific 
dose and at any time when necessary, through the enzymatic 
degradation of Larginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS).3 
Due to its ubiquitous physiological activity in humans, the 
biological roles of NO and its potential as a drug have been the 
focus of intense cell biology and medical research during the 
last decades.4 In this regard, the development of materials that 
enable the ondemand generation of exogenous NO with a 
spatiotemporally controlled gas release is a key aspect for the 
successful progression of both research fields.
