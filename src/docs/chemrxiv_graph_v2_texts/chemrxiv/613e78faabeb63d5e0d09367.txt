Description:
Used in the form of citrate-capped nanoparticles for enhanced sensitivity in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SLIPSERS).

Text:
Our approach is based upon the SLIPSERS method,6 in which a microdroplets of
citratecapped silver nanoparticles  with and without the analyte of interest  are de
posited on an omniphobic substrate and the solvent is evaporated o. Isotropic contrac
tion of the nearspherical droplet leads to the formation of compact nanoparticleanalyte
aggregates in which the local concentration of the analyte is enhanced in a reproducible
and concentrationdependent manner. The main advantage of SLIPSERS over other
surfaceenhanced Raman methods is that it dramatically improves sensitivity and de
creases detection limits, without requiring sophisticated substrate engineering.4,6
However, questions of analyte specicity remain, particularly in the context of analysing
complex chemical and biochemical mixtures.
