Involved in electrochemical nitrogen reduction on a solid electrode.

Centralised 
ammonia production results in fertiliser inequity based on 
wealth and geography Countries which lack the capital to 
build their own HaberBosch facility or the infrastructure to 
transport ammonia tend to suffer more on the global hunger 
index.1,4 A distributed, sustainable mode of ammonia synthesis 
would be preferable, such as electrochemical ammonia synthe
sis by nitrogen reduction5. The sole examples of rigorously verified continuous elec
trochemical nitrogen reduction on a solid electrode are the 
nonaqueous lithium and calcium mediated nitrogen reduction 
systems69, which both follow the same general principle. In 
these systems, a lithium or calcium salt is used to generate an 
active surface insitu via electrodeposition in an organic, apro
tic solvent.

Description:
A key reactant in the lithiummediated nitrogen reduction system.

Text:
In analogy to lithiumion batteries, a Solid Electro
lyte Interphase (SEI) layer forms on top of the active surface 
which consists of the decomposition products of the organic 
electrolyte3,1012. This SEI layer serves not only as protection 
from further electrolyte degradation but also regulates the ac
cess of key reactants (nitrogen, protons, and metal ions) to the 
active surface10,1321. One key aspect of the lithiummediated 
nitrogen reduction electrolyte is the proton donor, which has 
garnered significant attention recently.10,18,2224 The most 
common electrolyte in the lithiummediated nitrogen reduction 
system is tetrahydrofuran (THF) based, with a small quantity 
of ethanol added as a proton donor, although there have been 
investigations into other solvents25 and proton donors22. Until 
recently, the conventional wisdom was that ethanol acted as a 
sacrificial proton donor8,26.
