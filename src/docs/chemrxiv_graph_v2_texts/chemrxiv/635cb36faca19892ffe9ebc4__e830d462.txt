Description:
Known to be harmful and present in refill fluids before use.

Text:
Refill fluids also contain elementsmetals 1114, some of which (selenium, aluminum, 
tin, arsenic, chromium, lead, nickel, zinc, copper, manganese) are present before use and are 
known to be harmful 1117. Selenium, which is an impurity of propylene glycol and glycerin, 
can cause cytotoxicity to bronchial epithelial cells 11 and is on the Federal Drug 
Administrations (FDA) Harmful and Potentially Harmful list and the Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Research (ATSDR) Priority List of Hazardous Substances list 7, 15. Concentrations of some elements (copper, manganese, zinc, nickel) are higher in eliquids after 
use, presumably because they are released from the atomizing units during heating 1112, 18
20. In addition to elementsmetals, the fluid also contains nicotine and numerous flavor 
chemicals 2126.
