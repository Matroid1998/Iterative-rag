Description:
A donor in the emitter BTCZPZ1.

Text:
Both Cai et al.14 and Shin et al.15 have shown that the location of the sulfur atom 
affects the SOC between lowlying triplet and singlet excited states, impacting excitonic kinetics. The 
emitters BTCZPZ2 and BTCZPZ1, containing different regioisomeric 12Hbenzo4,5thieno 2,3
acarbazol (BT2) and 5Hbenzo4,5thieno3,2ccarbazole (BT1) donors (Figure 1), respectively, 
showed blue emission at PL of ca. 470 nm as 10 wt doped films in 2,8bis(diphenylphosphoryl)
dibenzob,dthiophene (PPT).14 TDDFT calculations predicted larger SOC matrix element (SOCME)
