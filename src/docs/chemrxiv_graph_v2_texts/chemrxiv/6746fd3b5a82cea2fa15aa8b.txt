Description:
Facilitate ring-opening reactions of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes to produce 1,3-bifunctionalized compounds.

Text:
The chemistry of donoracceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) is 
a rapidly developing field in modern organic synthesis. These 
stressed small carbocycles provide an attractive basis for the 
synthesis of acyclic as well as five, six, and sevenmembered 
compounds. 19. Many organic reactions are known for DACs 
5,1016. Three main types of reactions of DACs in which donor 
and acceptor substituents are located vicinal can be distinguished 
(Scheme 1) 17. Ringopening reactions involve the transformation 
of DAC by electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents in the presence of 
various Lewis acids (Scheme 1, (1)). This type of reaction can be 
used to produce 1,3bifunctionalized compounds with an open 
chain, and it is widely used in the synthesis of biologically active 
molecules 1820.
