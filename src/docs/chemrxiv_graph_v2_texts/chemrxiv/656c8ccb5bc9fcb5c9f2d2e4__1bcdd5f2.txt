Graphene5,6,7,8,9,10,11 possesses a high surface area (2630 m2 g1 
for monolayer graphene) compared to amorphous carbon, that can be utilized for the 
accumulation of ions within the EDL and thus significantly increase the capacitance of the 
electrodes. However, the successful utilization of the electrochemically active surface area of 
the electrode is directly related to its accessibility by the electrolyte (e.g., ingress of the 
electrolyte into its porous structure). On this basis, understanding the mechanism of wetting at 
the carbonaqueous electrolyte interface under potential bias (the phenomenon of 
electrowetting12) is essential in the pursuit of strategies to enhance the capacitance of the 
devices13,14,15.
