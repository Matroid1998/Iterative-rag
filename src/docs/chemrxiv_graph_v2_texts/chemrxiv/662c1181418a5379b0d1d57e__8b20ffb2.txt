Description:
Modulates the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA.

Increase in GABAergic activity is the basis for the mechanism of action of several anti
epileptic drugs (Macdonald and Kelly, 1993). For example, Clobazam, barbiturates such as
Phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines such as Diazepam are GABA receptor agonists, Tigabine
inhibits reuptake of GABA into the synaptic vescicles and increases the concentration of GABA in
the synaptic cleft, and Vigabatrin inhibits GABA degradation by inhibition of the enzyme GABA
transaminase (GABAT) (Czuczwar and Patsalos, 2001). The antiepileptic drugs Valproate and
Gabapentin are modulators of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) which catalyzes the
conversion of glutamate to GABA. Some of these antiepileptic drugs have multiple targets
(Macdonald and Kelly, 1993).
