Description:
Compounds of special interest due to their low basicity and high functional-group tolerance.

Text:
Transmetalation is one of the key elementary reactions in organo
metallic chemistry. It not only is one of the chief ways of synthesizing 
stoichiometric quantities of organometallic reagents, but also forms 
one of the central elementary steps of numerous catalytic transfor
mations, such as transitionmetal mediated crosscoupling reactions 
or CH functionalizations.1 Among the different transmetalating re
agents, organoboron compounds are of special interest because of 
their low basicity and high functionalgroup tolerance.
