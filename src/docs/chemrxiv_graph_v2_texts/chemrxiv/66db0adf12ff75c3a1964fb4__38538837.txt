Description:
A 2D metal-organic framework film developed with conditions to promote in-plane growth and delay homogeneous nucleation.

As a result, the stateoftheart UiO66 films are 23 orders of magnitude thicker than the desired 2D film (Figure S2 and 
Table S1). Herein, we report the first nonvdW 2D MOF in the form of 2D UiO66NH2 film by developing conditions leading to anisotropic 
2D growth. Briefly, the composition of the precursor solution was screened to develop growth conditions that delay homogeneous 
nucleation of UiO66NH2 in the bulk solution, promote inplane growth of 2D nuclei, and slow outofplane growth. This was further 
facilitated by the use of atomically smooth graphitic substrates. A crystallographic registry between the graphene superstructure and 
the 2D lattice of UiO66 along the aoutofplane direction was observed. The thickness of the film could be tuned from 0.5 to 2 unit 
cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
UiO66NH2, formed by the coordination of hexanuclear zirconiumoxo cluster and 2aminoterephthalate (BDCNH2), possesses a 
cubic structure with a composition of Zr6O6(BDCNH2)6.20, 34 It has been reported that crystallinity can be enhanced with modulators 
such as hydrochloric acid,35 benzoic acid,36 formic acid,37 and acetic acid.38 Achieving 2D films of UiO66NH2 is particularly chal
lenging due to the isotropic bond strength, which makes it difficult to synthesize anisotropic UiO66NH2 directly. To address this, 
synthesis conditions were modulated by screening different amounts of acetic acid as modulator to improve crystallinity, various 
metal and ligand concentrations, metaltoligand ratio, and the pH. Importantly, water was used as a solvent, keeping sustainability 
in mind. Atomically smooth graphitic substrates were used to promote inplane growth.
