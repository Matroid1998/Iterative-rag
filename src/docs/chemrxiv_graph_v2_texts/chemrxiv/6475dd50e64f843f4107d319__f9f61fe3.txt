Description:
Used in a test system to examine the impact of solvent and additives.

Owing to 
the different Lewis acidities of the alkali metal ions, the sulfonyl group is expected to more strongly bind 
to lithium, resulting in an enhanced leaving group ability and the preferred MSO2Tol elimination. Indeed, 
switching to sodium and potassium, respectively, led to a slightly improved selectivity for 2M (Entry 6 
and 7). Despite the high selectivity for the ketenyl anion 2M in THF, it was not possible to isolate it in 
pure form due to its similar solubility compared to the sulfinate. Therefore, we turned our attention 
towards examining the impact of the solvent and additional additives using 1bNa as test system. Unfor
