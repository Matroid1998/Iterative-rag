Description:
Metaloxo clusters known for their compact structure, high symmetry, low molecular charge, and stability.

Text:
Lindqvisttype polyoxometalates (POMs) are perhaps the most 
investigated metaloxo clusters due to their compact structure, 
high symmetry, low molecular charge, and stability.1,2 As their 
early transition metal centres such as vanadium3 can exhibit 
several thermodynamically stable oxidation states, POMs 
containing these addenda atoms are able to accept and release 
multiple electrons without a significant change of their 
structure and stability.46 
The possibility to address multiple charge states at one or 
several molecular centres opens the possibility to realize 
multistate logic, which offers significantly higher storage 
capacity per cell compared to binary logic. Thus, hybrid 
nanoelectronic devices involving POMs have the potential to 
revolutionize the current CMOSbased microelectronics. Another highpotential application area is batteries, which 
could reach immense cation densities immobilized in the POM 
vicinity.
