Based on these facts, the study of shrunken (as wrinkles) mango peel (WMP) by 
comparing it with unwrinkled mango peel (UMP) has been designed. Chaunsa mango was used 
in the experimental work of our study12. The study may provide the possible reasons for the 
cause of wrinkles in mango peels with time after overripening. We have analyzed the samples 
(WMP and UMP) using FTIR (Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy)13, DSC (Differential 
scanning calorimetry)14, 15, and CHNS (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulphur) elemental 
analyzer16, 17. In FTIR analysis, WMP showed higher absorption intensity peak bands than 
UMP. In the DSC experiment, WMP was found to be more endothermic in nature compared to 
UMP.
