Description:
Used in MRI contrast agents to optimize relaxivity and stability.

Text:
Due to the development of gadolinium(III) based MRI 
contrast agents, these systems have been extensively stud
ied to optimize and control the relaxivity and stability of 
these Gd(III) complexes.3, 18, 27 Small structural perturba
tions, such as enforced control of conformational space, 
have been shown to dramatically influence these proper
ties.3, 11, 2835 Steric effects of adding extra substituents can 
be used to favor specific conformations and prevent either 
ring inversion or sidearm rotation.3, 31, 34, 3638 Introduction 
of a pNO2benzyl group in the macrocycle has been shown 
to lock the conformation of the cyclen ring thus resulting 
in only two conformations present.36 Methyl groups in the 
 position of all the pendant arms have been shown to pre
vent sidearm rotation, as in the complexes of DOTMA.31, 
34, 37 By combining these effects in efforts to investigate the 
relationship between conformation, chirality and the phys
icochemical properties of lanthanide(II) complexes, sys
tems with only one conformation have been made and 
used to show strong dependencies between relaxometric 
properties and structure.11, 35 Thus, it must be anticipated 
that the structural perturbations induced by a chiral envi
ronment can have dramatic effect on these complexes.
