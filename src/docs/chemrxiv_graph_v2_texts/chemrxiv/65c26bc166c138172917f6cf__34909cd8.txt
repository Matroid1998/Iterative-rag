Description:
Used to convert crude reaction product mixture to aminoalcohol in good yield without erosion of enantiopurity.

Text:
Addition of sodium ethoxide gave 
ethyl ester 3s in good yield and 919 er, while addition of pyrrolidine gave tertiary amide 3t in excellent 
yield and 9010 er. Pleasingly, addition of lithium aluminium hydride to the crude reaction product 
mixture after solvent exchange gave aminoalcohol 3u in good yield with no erosion of enantiopurity. The reaction can also be carried out on gramscale, with propargylic amide 3v obtained in good yield 
and 8812 er. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024v787gv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000221047313 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
