Description:
A photosensitive anode used in photoelectrochemical cells to split water.

Text:
Since 1972, when Fujishima and Honda 8 first proposed the concept of using photosensitive 
anodes, like TiO2, in dedicated photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells to split water, a major research 
effort has been devoted to optimizing semiconductor photoelectrodes, to match a list of needed 
properties regarding i) light absorption, ii) surface kinetics during electrochemical reactions, iii) 
charge separation and bulk electrical conduction, iv) chemical composition and stability, etc. 913. Since common materials do not meet all requirements, band engineering is explored intensively to 
overcome intrinsic materials drawbacks. The principal target for these studies is achieving the 
maximum generated photocurrent for the minimum energy input.
