Description:
Element that, along with double bonds, is not acceptable in terpenes for aviation fuel applications.

Text:
The branched structure of 
isoprene causes most terpenes to have methyl side 
chains, which promotes favorable coldweather 
properties such as low melting points 6. The bio
synthesis process readily produces rings, including 
strained rings with carbon numbers as low as three, 
which gives terpenes high energy densities 6, 7. The biosynthesis process can also functionalize the 
terpenes by adding hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, 
ether bridges, etc. (These molecules are often 
termed terpenoids, but we will include them with 
terpenes.) For some applications, especially current 
aviation engines, oxygen and double bonds are not 
acceptable since they compromise energy density 
and storage stability; therefore terpenes must be 
hydrogenated to saturated hydrocarbons before they 
can be used as fuels 6.

Description:
An element that can suppress soot formation in terpenes.

Text:
The sootiness of terpenes relative to conventional 
jet fuel is not obvious terpenes are usually not 
aromatic and they often contain oxygen, which can 
suppress soot formation 15, but they also contain 
structural features that enhance soot formation such 
as double bonds and rings 16. Donoso et al. have 
demonstrated 
that 
turpentinederived 
terpene 
mixtures can have lower sooting tendencies than 
conventional jet fuel, and that hydrogenating them 
reduces sooting tendency further 2. Zschocke et al. have shown that adding the hydrogenated analogue 
of 
the 
sesquiterpene 
farnesane 
(2, 6, 10trimethyldodecane) to Jet A1 reduces 
sooting tendency 17. The objective of this study is to systematically 
investigate the sooting behavior of terpenes and 
their hydrogenated analogues.
