of an olefin onto the carbene 
center has been much less investigated, and has been 
limited to formation of a Calkenyl and a CH bond by 
direct reaction of boronic acids or esters with diazo 
compounds or Ntosylhydrazones.6 This is a major 
drawback, as olefins are ubiquitous in chemical biology 
or material science and serve as a versatile platform for 
a plethora of chemical transformations. Figure 1. Cu(I)catalyzed vinylation of diazo compounds.

Description:
Synthesized through cross-coupling with palladium carbene intermediates.

Text:
In this context, the generation of palladium carbene 
intermediates combined with crosscoupling with 
organic halides has been highly successful for olefin 
synthesis in the past, but often results in the formation 
of alkene products through hydride elimination, with 
few notable exceptions.2b,3 An interesting approach first 
reported by Van Vranken and coworkers, employing 
vinylhalides as coupling partners allows to conserve an 
allylic stereocenter and to introduce at the same time a 
heteroatom nucleophile (Figure 1B).7 Nevertheless, the 
reaction proceeds via a allyl palladium species, 
resulting into a 1,3 relationship between nucleophile 
and vinyl group. In comparison to palladium as catalyst, 
rhodium usually allows to avoid hydride elimination.
