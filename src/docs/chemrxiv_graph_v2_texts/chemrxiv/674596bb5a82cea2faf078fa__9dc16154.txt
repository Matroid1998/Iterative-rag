Description:
A hydrogen bond donor combined with metal halide hydrogen bond acceptors.

Text:
For molecular plastic crystals more gen
erally, the transition temperature, Tc, increases with increasing number of hydroxyl
groups and therefore increases possible hydrogen bond pathways in molecular plastic
crystals 11. To further our understanding of the influence of hydrogen bonding in orderdisorder
phase transitions in plastic crystals and to have control over its barocaloric properties,
we combine the hydrogen bond donor choline with metal halide hydrogen bond accep
tors in the present work. The metal halide anions of choice in this work are CoCl2
4
and ZnCl2
4
which form highly symmetric tetrahedral complexes that promotes plastic
crystal phase formation. Additionally, exploring this system allows for the elucidation
of the role of the metal centre in its properties.
