Description:
Compounds that display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties.

Text:
For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene 
units are partially replaced by anthracene units to increase 
the diameter of helicenes,6) and perylene bisimideincorpo
rated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthe
sized.7) These diameterexpanded helicene analogues dis
play interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical proper
ties.

Description:
Compounds whose electronic properties are evaluated through systematic synthesis.

Text:
Therefore, it is more difficult to syn
thesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, 
whereas several heterohelicenes with a doublelayered 
structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri
oxa13helicene D.12) Furthermore, a triplelayered struc
ture was accomplished with oxanhelicene E (n  17, 19) 
albeit with disrupted conjugation.13) To qualitatively eval
uate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is 
necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated het
erohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic 
strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispen
sable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are 
available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.
