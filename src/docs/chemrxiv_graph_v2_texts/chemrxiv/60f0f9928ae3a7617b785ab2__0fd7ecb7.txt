Description:
Bidentate nitrogen-ligated iodine(V) compounds first reported in 2002.

Text:
Bidentate nitrogenligated iodine(V) compounds, Bi(N)HVIs, were first reported by Zhdankin 
and coworkers in 2002.4 Recently, we demonstrated that these compounds, and specifically 
Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI, were uniquely effective at facilitating the highly efficient double 
oxidative dearomatization of electrondeficient phenols, such as pnitrophenol (Table 1, entries 
1 and 2).5 In this report, the reactivity of Bi(4CO2Etbipy)HVI was benchmarked against a 
range of other iodine(V) reagents. Specifically, IBX provided very low yields of the target 
quinone and precursor PhI(O)(OAc)2 gave no reaction at all (entries 3 and 4). The stronger 
oxidant PhI(O)(OTf)2 afforded the product quinone in 59 yield after 20 minutes, which 
decreased to 27 yield after 4 hours due to continued oxidative degradation (entries 5 and 6).
