Description:
Undergoes electrocatalytic transformation to NO2 and NO3 with high faradaic efficiencies.

In 2022, the group of Brudvig 
demonstrated the electrocatalytic transformation of NH3 to NO2 and NO3 in a homogeneous electrocatalytic ap
proach with a Cucomplex, with high faradaic efficiencies.16 
Ammonia oxidation in water is not only environmentally friendlier but also offers the opportunity to release 4 
equivalents of H2 per ammonia molecule while forming a valueadded product (NO3), which is used in fertilizers. Fertilizer production dominates the industrial use of nitric acid with almost 81, however, its synthesis via the 
Ostwald process is highly energy demanding.17,18 
Molecular electrocatalysts show high activity in comparison to heterogeneous catalysts but suffer from reduced 
stability. The high pH of aqueous ammonia solutions presents an additional challenge for the stability of these 
catalysts.
