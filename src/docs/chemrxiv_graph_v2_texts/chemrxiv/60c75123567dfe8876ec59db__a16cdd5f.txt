Polymeric biomaterials with significant impact on medical technologies have been extensively studied in the last few 
2 
decades and have been used as artificial organs, wound healing, biomedical packaging, therapeutic agents, drug
3 
delivery, and artificial kidney and hearts 16. In an effort to design and synthesis of polymeric biomaterials, different 
4 
synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, and poly 
5 
(ethylene glycol) have been synthesized and their biocompatibility for using in biomedical application have been 
6 
studied 3, 4, 79. Generally, the biocompatibility (which is defined as an ability of materials to be compatible with 
7 
cells, tissues and etc. )5, 10 of these polymers is an important factor, and is governing the design and synthesis of 
8 
them 11.

Description:
Versatile and tunable polymers synthesized using different hard and soft segments.

Text:
Possibility to use different hard and soft segments for synthesizing polyurethane 
22 
to achieve desired properties made them versatile and tunable polymers. For example, different kind of polyurethanes 
23 
such as polycarbonate urethane, urethane acrylates, polyurethane polyols, polyester urethane, and polyether urethane 
24 
have been synthesized by changing the soft segment (Polyol groups) and have been used in different applications 23
25 
33. Among aforementioned synthetic polyurethanes, recent studies have been shown that polycarbonate based 
26 
urethanes have better biocompatibility and biostability than other kinds of polyurethanes for medical applications 
27 
which was correlated to higher stability of the soft segments (polycarbonate) inside of the body 34.
