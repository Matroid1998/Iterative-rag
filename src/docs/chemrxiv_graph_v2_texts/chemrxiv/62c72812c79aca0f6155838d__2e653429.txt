Description:
Synthesis methods use protecting groups and linkers requiring harsh conditions for cleavage and deprotection.

Many noncanonical nucleotides have been found in DNA and RNA. They serve as an additional layer 
of regulation of the flow of genetic information in biological systems. Malfunction of this layer of regulation 
has been found relating to many human diseases.14 In addition, modified nucleotides can also be produced 
by reactions of DNA with DNA modification drugs and toxic compounds from the environment. These 
DNA adducts have been suggested to be the cause of many cancers.58 To study the functional mechanisms 
of the modified nucleotides including those that cause human diseases, chemical synthesis of 
oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) and oligoribonucleotide (ORN) containing such modified nucleotides is 
needed. However, known oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis methods use protecting groups and linkers that 
require harsh basic and nucleophilic conditions for cleavage and deprotection.
