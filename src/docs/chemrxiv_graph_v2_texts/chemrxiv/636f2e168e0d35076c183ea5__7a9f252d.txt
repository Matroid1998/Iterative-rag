Description:
An open-shell complex with a 3d6 electronic configuration and three closely lying spin multiplets.

The diverse appli
cability of these molecules is further amplified upon deposition on metallic substrates.715 The
interfaces formed between those molecules and the metallic substrates differ from other molecule
substrate interfaces by multiple factors.1620 Openshell iron(II) porphyrin and phthalocyanine
complexes, with a 3d6 electronic configuration have attracted a significant share of attention as
they possess three closely lying spinmultiplets, i.e., singlet (low spin), triplet (intermediate spin),
and quintet (high spin).
