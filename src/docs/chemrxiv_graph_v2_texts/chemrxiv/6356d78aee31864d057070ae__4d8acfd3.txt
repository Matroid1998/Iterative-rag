Description:
Molecules that can cause considerable reorganization or reconstruction of surfaces upon adsorption.

Text:
The evolution and geometry of these structures are driven mainly by 
the stabilization resulting from van der Waals (vdW) interactions between 
adjacent adsorbed molecules.1,2 However, in addition to the molecular 
phenomenon of selforganization, it has also been demonstrated that, on some 
surfaces, the adsorption of thiol molecules can cause considerable 
reorganization or reconstruction of the surface itself. On Au(111), for example, thiolinduced reconstruction is associated with 
formation of atomic vacancies (VAu) and corresponding gold adatomthiolate 
complexes ((RS)xAuad, x  1  4), where the Auad species is generally bonded 
to threefold hollow sites on the underlying Au(111) substrate.11 Increasing 
coverage () of the thiol promotes increasing degrees of surface reconstruction.12 
For linear alkanethiolatebased SAMs, (RS)2Auad species are mainly formed, 
with a thiolate saturation surface coverage of 0.33.
