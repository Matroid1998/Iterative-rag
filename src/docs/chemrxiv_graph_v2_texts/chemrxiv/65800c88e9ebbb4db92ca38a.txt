Description:
Observed in submarine hydrothermal systems and derives from marine carbonate and mantle carbon.

Since the first discovery in 1989 (1), discharges of liquid and hydratecoated CO2 has been 
observed in various submarine hydrothermal systems (26). Isotopic and compositional analyses have 
revealed that the venting CO2 derives from marine carbonate and mantle carbon, with a minor 
contribution from sedimentary organic matter (2, 7). In the deep reaction zones of submarine 
hydrothermal systems, elevated temperature and pressure allows even molarlevel dissolution of CO2 
into hydrothermal fluids, whereas their upward flow and mixing with seawater reduce CO2 solubility, 
facilitating the phase separation of CO2 (3, 8). The phase separation of CO2 in subseafloor upwelling 
regions has also been suggested from fluid inclusions in 3.5Gyrold hydrothermal precipitates from 
the Pilbara craton, Australia (9, 10).
