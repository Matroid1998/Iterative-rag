Description:
Atoms that are sp3 hybridized and break the conjugation between donor and acceptor.

The proper choice of the linker is 
crucial for TADF as well as the selection of D and A units because its role on regulating the 
HOMOLUMO overlap. Moreover, the conjugated linker is also involved in possible stack
ing that would lead to a reduced efficiency through the aggregationcaused quenching phenom
enon.21,22 Suitable system for TADF are often containing spirocarbon atoms, e.g., sp3hy
bridized atoms that breaks the conjugation between donor and acceptor.23 Among the large 
number of employed spiro compounds 9,9spirobifluorene (SBF) is one of the first used as 
core20 and lately as sidechain group taking advantage of the threedimensional crossshape 
structure as a mean to limit stacking and increase the stiffness of the system.20,2428 It has been
