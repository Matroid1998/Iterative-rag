Description:
Used in hybrid form for asymmetric oxidative coupling catalyzed by iron.

Text:
Hence, the development of a new and convenient chirality
induction strategy for iron catalyzed asymmetric oxidative coupling with alternative hybrid carbon is a highly important
objective. Mechanochemistry9,10 provides exciting synthetic opportunities with no dissolution anxiety to generate new
chemical reactivity11 and selectivity12. A notable technique derived from mechanochemistry is liquidassisted grinding
