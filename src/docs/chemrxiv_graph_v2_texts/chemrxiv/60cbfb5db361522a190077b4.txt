process, as a competing energy dissipation pathway, might be relatively restrained, 
but the exposure of AIEgens to oxygen would be significantly enhanced owing to the 
extended intermolecular distance and loosened surrounding environment, which 
offers a valid compensation for the restrained ISC channel and ensures the effective 
ROS generation. Additionally, notwithstanding the promoted intramolecular motions 
under the assistant of the side chain, the radiative transitionrelated fluorescence 
emission could still be retained through tactfully controlling the length of the
