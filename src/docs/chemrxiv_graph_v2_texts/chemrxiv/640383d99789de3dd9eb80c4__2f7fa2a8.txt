Description:
A highly reactive probe used to assess cysteine reactivity across the proteome.

Text:
There has been an exciting revolution in chemical biology to examine the proteomewide reactivity 
and ligandability of cysteine residues using mass spectrometry proteomics. These studies have served as a 
starting point for identification of new ligandable protein targets and the development of covalent probes and 
drugs.25,26 Cysteine reactivity across the proteome is generally assessed by measuring labeling efficiency 
with a highly reactive iodoacetamide probe.27,28 Cysteine ligandability, on the other hand, is examined by 
treating the proteome with smallmolecule covalent fragments bearing weaker electrophiles, like 
chloroacetamide or acrylamide, followed by treatment with an iodoacetamide probe.

Description:
Used for labeling specific cysteines to reveal selectivity profiles of fragment electrophiles across the proteome.

Text:
The loss of 
iodoacetamide labeling at specific cysteines reveals the selectivity profile of fragment electrophiles across the 
proteome.29 Cysteine ligandability screens have the potential to simultaneously identify target proteins and 
lead compounds for covalent probe development. In general, these chemoproteomic efforts are not targeted  instead, they yield large datasets on the 
ligandability of thousands of cysteine residues.
