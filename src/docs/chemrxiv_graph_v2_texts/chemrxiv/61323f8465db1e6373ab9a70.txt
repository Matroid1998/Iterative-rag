Description:
Molecules that photodegrade more rapidly at concentrations above the saturation limit where self-association is observed.

Text:
Emission and excitation spectra of some aromatic mole
cules at airice interfaces acquired by surfaceselective LIF 
show red shifts compared to spectra in dilute aqueous solu
tion, indicative of selfassociation.1316 We have recently re
ported that anthracene molecules in liquid aqueous solu
tion photodegrade much more rapidly at concentrations 
well above the saturation limit where spectroscopic evi
dence of selfassociation is observed than in dilute solu
tions, and that the photodegradation kinetics shift from 1st 
to 2nd order at these high concentrations.17 We have hypoth
esized that aromatic species form clusters at ice surfaces, 
and that selfassociated anthracene molecules in these clus
ters react via different mechanisms than monomeric an
thracene in liquid water or at airwater interfaces.17 How
ever, other research groups have reported a lack of selfas
sociation of aromatic species in ice samples, supported by 
spectroscopic evidence and MD simulations.18, 19 
The key to predicting reactivity of aromatic species (and 
perhaps nonaromatic species) in snow and ice may lie in 
elucidating the interactions of these species with each other 
and with their surroundings.
