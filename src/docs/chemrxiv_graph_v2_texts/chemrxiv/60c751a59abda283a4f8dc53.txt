Description:
A natural product isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, used in effective treatments for malaria.

Recent years have seen the
increased use of computational methods such as these to aid the drug discovery process
8,9,10,11. For instance, there have been successes in the in silico target prediction of small
molecules with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis 12,13. In the case of the malaria parasite, the development of resistance to frontline treatments is
an everpresent problem. Since the isolation of artemisinin from the plant Artemisia annua in
1971 by Tu Youyou and colleagues 14, this natural product and its derivatives have been
used in some of the most effective treatments for malaria. The artemisininbased
combination therapies (ACTs) utilise a shortacting artemisinin derivative in combination with
one or more complementary antimalarials that are longacting and possess a different
mechanism of action (MoA).
