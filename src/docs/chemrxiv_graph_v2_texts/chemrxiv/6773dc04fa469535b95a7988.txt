Description:
Used as a conductive additive in battery electrodes to enhance electronic transport.

In that sense, the optimization of the battery electrode manufacturing process is a critical step 
in terms of its influence on the final battery performance.13 The electrode manufacturing 
process can be decomposed overall in three stages (Figure 1a), one following each other the 
slurry preparation through premixing followed by mixing of Active Material (AM) with 
conductive additives and binders in a solvent, then the coating of the resulting slurry onto a 
current collector prior its drying, and finally the calendering of the resulting dried electrode. A 
wellmanufactured electrode ensures optimal contact between the AM, the carbon additives and 
the liquid electrolyte filling the pores, enhancing electronic and ionic transport, and decreasing 
the overall internal resistances.
