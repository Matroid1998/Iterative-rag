Description:
A polymer synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) with synthetic flexibility for end group engineering.

In contrast to conventional fluorescent polymers incorporating FRET systems, fewer 
colortunable TSCT polymers have been reported likely due to the multistep and tedious monomer syntheses. Their applications are predominantly restricted to the fabrication of optically active layers in organic lightemitting 
diodes37. We have recently reported that colortunable TSCT polymers could be obtained via end group engineering of 
polystyrene synthesized from a singlefluorophore initiator38, thanks to the synthetic flexibility of atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP)3941. Specifically, structurally distant TSCT from the polymer chain end to the 
acceptortype fluorophore was induced by an unexpected chainend deactivation. Thus, continuous emission 
wavelength tuning could be achieved by varying the polymer chain length. However, despite the simplicity and
