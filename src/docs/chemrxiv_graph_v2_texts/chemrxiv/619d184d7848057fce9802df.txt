Description:
Organic molecules with a helical structure that can have modified physical and optoelectronic properties through BN incorporation.

Text:
The replacement of CC for isoelectronic BN units generates superficially similar molecules, but the BN 
congeners often have distinct properties.1 Due to this phenomenon BN incorporation into organic 
materials has received significant attention,2 with it now an established approach to modify physical 
and optoelectronic properties.3 This approach has been applied to helicenes, with BN incorporation 
within the helical backbone of 4helicenes (e.g. A and B, Fig. 1) found to improve the fluorescence
