experimental attention has been devoted to mesoporous
MOFs, although molecular simulations predict a strong
correlation between the pore diameter and the NTE
magnitude.20 Since larger pore volumes allow for greater
uptake of guests, stronger guest eects can be expected. Furthermore, the study of mesoporous MOFs at non
ambient conditions helps evaluate their structural sta
