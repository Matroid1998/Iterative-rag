Description:
A gas to which Mo-bearing TMDs exhibit exceptionally high sensitivity, enhancing selectivity in gas sensing applications.

In response to this challenge, researchers have demonstrated that rapid
recovery can be achieved by employing gate bias and light illumina
tion techniques 20, 22, 24 In this context, all Mobearing TMDs offer
distinct advantages. However, among them, MoTe2 appears to hold the
greatest potential for detecting NO2 at room temperature. This is due
to its narrow bandgap, which also makes it wellsuited for recovery
enhancement through illumination. Another pertinent issue relates to selectivity. Mobearing TMDs
exhibit exceptionally high sensitivity specifically to NO2. While this
attribute enhances their selectivity for NO2, it simultaneously restricts
the broader utility of TMDbased sensors in gas sensing applications.
