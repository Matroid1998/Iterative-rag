Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, chemical formula MX2, M  transition metal, X  S, 
Se, Te) are a class of twodimensional materials consisting of individual MX2 layers stacked by 
van der Waals forces. Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been studied 
extensively in a wide range of fields such as electrochemical energy storage,1 
electrocatalysis,2 electrochemical water desalination,3 or tribology4. As a consequence, a 
large number of synthesis approaches resulting in diverse morphologies andor crystallite 
sizes are reported in literature.5 
While exfoliation or gas phase deposition methods like chemical vapor or atomic layer 
deposition can produce monofewlayered materials with high precision,6 hydrothermal 
methods can be employed to obtain MoS2 with varying morphology in larger quantities. For 
the latter, morphology, particlecrystallite size, or crystallinity can be tuned by variation of 
synthesis parameters.
