Chiral allylic amines are attractive synthetic targets due to their diverse bioactivities and versatility as 
synthons for subsequent manipulations.1 Metalcatalyzed TsujiTrost amination2 and Overman 
rearrangement3 of allyl systems devised one of the highly effective protocols for their synthesis. Another popular alternative involved the asymmetric addition of vinyl organometallic to electrophilic 
imines.4 Among them, Noyoritype vinyl zinc addition5 and NozakiHiyamaKishi6 reactions are 
notable. While powerful, the presynthesis of starting materials, vinyl organometallic reagents, and 
associated stereoselectivity challenges advocated for benign options. The imine vinylation via direct reductive coupling of imines with alkynes is logically uncovered as an 
exciting operationally simple approach.7 However, unlike the reductive coupling of alkynes with 
aldehydes,8 the coupling with imines is limited in its prominence.
