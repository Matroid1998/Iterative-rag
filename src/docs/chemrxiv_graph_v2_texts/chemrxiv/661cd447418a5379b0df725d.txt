Description:
Studied using SAE NMR to observe dynamics in solid-state Li-ion battery materials.

Probing dynamical eects is particularly important for
energy materials, in which mobile ions drive the device
functionality. The mobility of species and structural fea
tures such as disorder and defects are closely interwoven,
and often are the critical factors for determining device
performance. In order to establish a correlation between
structure and dynamics, various experimental ssNMR
methods can be employed 1, 2. One such method is SAE
NMR, which is commonly used to study Li dynamics in
operando within solidstate Liion battery materials 3
6. SAE probes the quadrupolar interaction of the EFG
tensor at the 7Li nucleus (spin I  32) with its local
surrounding environment in order to observe the motion
of Liions hopping between various sites in a material.
