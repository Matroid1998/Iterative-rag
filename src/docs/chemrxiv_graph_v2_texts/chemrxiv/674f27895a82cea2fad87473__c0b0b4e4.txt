Description:
A hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric built from molecular units, undergoing order-disorder transitions.

Text:
Ferroelectric materials exhibit a spontaneous and switchable polarisation arising from the alignment of 
electric dipoles with an applied electric field. In most ferroelectrics, the atomic mechanism involves 
dipoles that are correlated below a symmetrybreaking phase transition this includes both the displacive 
transitions common amongst ceramics, such as the widely industrially used BaTiO3,1,2 and orderdisorder 
transitions in the hydrogenbonded ferroelectrics Rochelles salt and K2HPO4, which are built from 
molecular units.3,4 These phase transitions are associated with a sharp discontinuity in the dielectric 
permittivity as a function of temperature.
