Description:
NPF events in the Arctic are primarily centered around HIO3 with minimal participation from sulfuric acid.

Coastal nutrient enhancement, likely due to runoff,
has greatly increased the algae population along with other anthropogenic emissions on and
near the coast of China and has resulted in regionally high iodine concentrations.43 Since
preindustrial times, its believed that there has been a 70 increase in atmospheric iodine.44
Iin sea water in the presence of ample ozone concentrations, can also lead to the formation
and emission of various organoiodide compounds into the atmosphere.4547 During the day,
if concentrations of CH2I2 are in the 10s of ppt range, NPF can take place without any
other contributing species.30 It has even been found that iodine oxoacid nucleation rates are
higher than those of sulfuric acid  ammonia clusters at equal concentrations of acids.48 In
the Arctic, over pack ice, the concentration of iodic acid is 6  10 times higher than that of
sulfuric acid, and as a result NPF events are primarily centered around HIO3, with minimal
to no participation from sulfuric acid or any other species.33
Since acidbase chemistry plays such an important role in these early stage NPF clusters,
the role of ammonia has also been explored in iodine containing clusters as it is important in
