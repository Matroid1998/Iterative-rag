Description:
Drives the dynamic assembly of tubulin into microtubules.

Text:
The ATPdriven ATPase pump and GTP
driven dynamic assembly of tubulin into microtubules are 
prototypical examples.13 Inspired by such biomolecular 
machinery, reaction cycles that catalytically convert fuels 
into waste have been devised to power synthetic 
molecular machineries like dynamic assembly fibers 
driven by the hydrolysis of methylating agents4 or the 
rotation of a molecular motor catalyzed by the hydration 
of carbodiimides.56 In these reaction cycles, two chemical 
reactions operate simultaneously (1) an activation 
reaction is the reaction between the high chemical 
potential (which we call fuel) and a catalyst, which 
activates the catalyst, and (2) a deactivation reaction that 
reverts the activated catalyst to its original state (Scheme 
1A).
