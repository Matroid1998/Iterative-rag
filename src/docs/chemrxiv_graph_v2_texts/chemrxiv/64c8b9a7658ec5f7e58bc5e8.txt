Description:
A key element involved in hypoxia sensing and homeostasis maintenance through its regulation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL2VHL.

The 
importance of therapeutic interventions is evidenced by the development of proteasome 
inhibitors, which, however, have several limitations as they lack specificity and may lead to the 
accumulation of a variety of cellular proteins.2,6 However, there are attractive therapeutic targets 
upstream of the proteasome, in particular E3 ligases, which endow the UPS system with high 
specificity. Respective drugs can act by disrupting or modulating the interaction of E3 ligases 
with their natural substrates.5 
In recent years, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL2VHL has attracted enormous attention, in 
particular, because of its key role in oxygen and hypoxia sensing.79 One of the most well
characterized substrates of VHL is the hypoxiainducible factor1 (HIF1). This transcription 
factor regulates numerous human genes, including those related to the maintenance of oxygen 
homeostasis.
