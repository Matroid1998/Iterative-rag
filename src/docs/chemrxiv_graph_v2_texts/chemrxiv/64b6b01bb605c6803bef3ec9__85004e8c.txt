Description:
Used in acid hydrolysis for lignocellulose digestion at high temperatures.

Text:
Lignocellulose still has 
untapped potential as renewable raw material, especially the 30  50  cellulose it contains, which 
makes cellulose the most abundand (bio)polymer worldwide.1, 2 Of the 170x109 t lignocellulosic 
biomass produced annually, only 34 are currently used for food and nonfood purposes.3 Once 
digested, various platform chemicals such as 5hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural can be obtained 
from cellulose.4, 5 Conventional aqueous digestions, like acid hydrolysis, were typically carried 
out with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid at temperatures of 100180 C, leading to monomeric 
sugars.68 An alternative to conventional digestions is mechanochemistry, which has advanced in 
recent decades and was acknowledged as one of the top ten emerging technologies in chemistry 
by IUPAC in 2019.9 As a solventfree process, mechanocatalysis enables lignocellulose digestion 
through the combination of mechanical forces and a Brnsted acid.1012 Mechanocatalytic partial 
depolymerization of lignocellulose, cellulose and hemicellulose is carried out with a strong 
acid (pKa below 1.812), e.g.
