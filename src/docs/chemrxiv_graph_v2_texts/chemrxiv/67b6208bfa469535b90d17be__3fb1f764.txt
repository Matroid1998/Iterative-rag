Description:
A magnetically separable catalyst used in hydrogenation reactions.

Text:
Recently, for example, scholars in China re
ported a new Ptloaded Nigraphene magnetically separable catalyst (PtNiNG) at a Pt weight loading 
of 0.3 exhibiting excellent activity for the hydrogenation of NB to aniline achieving a turnover frequency 
of 27,240 h1 at 1 MPa reaction pressure and room temperature.6 Remarkably, the catalyst retained its 
selective activity over five consecutive testing cycles.
