Description:
Complexes with inherent redox-active centers and tailored coordination geometries, enhancing catalytic efficacy.

Schiff bases, named after Hugo Schiff, are iminebased ligands formed through the condensation 
reaction between primary amines and carbonyl compounds, typically aldehydes or ketones 1. These highly versatile ligands exhibit pronounced chelating abilities, stabilizing a wide range of 
metal ions by forming robust coordination complexes 2. Their electronic tunability, structural 
diversity, and thermal stability make Schiff basemetal complexes indispensable in modern 
coordination chemistry, particularly in catalytic and electrocatalytic processes 3. Among these, 
nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) Schiff base complexes have garnered significant attention due to their 
inherent redoxactive centers, facile ligandfield modulations, and tailored coordination 
geometries, which collectively enhance their catalytic efficacy.
