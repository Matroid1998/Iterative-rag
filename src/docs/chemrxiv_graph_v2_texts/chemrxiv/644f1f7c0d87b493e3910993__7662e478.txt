Description:
Fluorescent compounds produced upon cleavage of the azo group, used for selective detection of hypoxia.

Text:
These fluorescence probes initially have no fluorescence due to fluorescence 
quenching by the azobenzene moiety incorporated in the fluorophore. Upon cleavage of the azo group 
by reductasecatalyzed reactions that are accelerated in hypoxia, corresponding fluorescent 
rhodamines are produced, enabling selective detection of hypoxia. However, the oxygen concentration 
threshold of these rhodaminebased hypoxia probes varies depending on the fluorescent scaffold. For 
example, MASR and 2,6diMe azoSiR640 switched on at around 0.1 and 5 oxygen concentration, 
respectively.21,23 These characteristics may be due to differences in the rate of reverse oxidation of the 
azo moiety depending on the fluorescent scaffold (Figure S1). Thus, we considered that the 
development of NIR probes to selectively detect severe hypoxia of around 1 oxygen concentration 
might be achieved by using different fluorophores.
