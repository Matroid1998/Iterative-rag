Description:
Appears as weak lines in X-ray diffraction patterns when solid solutions are heated above 700 K.

Text:
At higher temperatures they decompose into an 
equilibrium mixture of two solid solutions cubic (depleted ZnO) and wurtzite (enriched ZnO). In 
the case of solid solutions with low (x  0.2, 0.1) ZnO content, a more complicated behavior is 
observed 8. Due to the thermodynamic instability of cubic FeO (wstite) at temperatures below 
843 K, weak lines of Fe and spinel (Fd3m) phase (probably of Zn1yFeyFe2O4 composition) 
appear in the Xray diffraction patterns when these solid solutions are heated above 700 K. Then the 
intensity of these lines decreases and at temperatures above 900 K they disappear completely 8. At 
the same time, the formation of solid solutions with wurtzite structure is not observed up to 1100 K 
(the maximum temperature reached in the experiment).
