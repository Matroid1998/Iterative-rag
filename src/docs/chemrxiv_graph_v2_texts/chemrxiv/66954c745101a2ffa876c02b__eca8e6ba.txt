Description:
Exhibit a wide range of photodeactivation mechanisms under UV exposure.

Text:
The photochemical and photophysical properties of nucleobases
have been studied for decades.18 Although widely explored,
these systems continue to be an important subject of scientific
curiosity due to the wide range of photodeactivation mechanisms
under UV exposure and discrepancies regarding their mechanis
tic details.57 The situation becomes much more complex in nu
cleic acids, where additional processes may occur, including the
formation of delocalized excitonic and excimeric states, excita
tion energy transfer, intrastrand and interstrand electron and pro
ton transfer processes, among others.7,8 In general, in aggregates
of nucleobases, the local intramolecular nonradiative decay pro
cesses compete with intermolecular processes, and the simplest
model systems to study these processes are hydrogenbonded or
stacked nucleobase dimers.929
Surprisingly, studies of these processes on an equal footing
are scarce, even for canonical base pairs.
