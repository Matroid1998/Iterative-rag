Description:
A functional group involved in strain-promoted oxidation-controlled cyclooctyne-quinone cycloaddition (SPOQC).

Ever since the visionary publication of the Sharpless group about click chemistry, this field has 
grown significantly and has had a tremendous impact on drug discovery, bioconjugation and 
modern chemistry in general.1, 2 Many click reactions are bioorthogonal, a term first used by 
Bertozzi in 2003, indicating that functional groups are only mutually reactive and do not 
interfere with biochemical processes occurring in living systems.36 Examples of 
bioorthogonal click reactions include the strainpromoted azidealkyne cycloaddition 
(SPAAC), the Staudinger ligation and strainpromoted oxidationcontrolled cyclooctyne1,2
quinone cycloaddition (SPOQC).79 In the last decade, bioorthogonal chemistry has 
successfully been employed in both diagnostic (e.g.
