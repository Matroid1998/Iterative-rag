Description:
Manifests an opposite resonance effect than boron.

In the last couple of decades, a large number of developments happened in the field 
of efficient organic TADFbased chromophores and their synthesis. With such burgeoning, 
alternative approaches to DA systems have been scanned. Hatakeyama et al. have shown 
that nitrogen is manifests a opposite resonance effect than boron and relative para
substitution of boron and nitrogen can enhance such opposite resonance effect which can 
significantly separate the HOMOLUMO.4 Devising coplanar system with high oscillator 
strength with low EST have been shown by Chen et al.5 Even the theoretical studies 
involving spinvibronic coupling or hyperfine coupling has made a significant impact 
explaining rISC pathways in TADF systems.68 Samanta et al. have shown the effect of LE 
characteristics in triplet manifolds for a better rISC rate.9
