Description:
Atoms participate in the formation of H-bond networks with lattice water molecules.

The first approach is based on including proton carrier guest molecules 
(ammoniumbased cations, Nheterocyclebased molecules) into the MOFs pores.27,28 In the 
second approach, organic linkers with acidic functionalities (sulfono or phosphonogroups) are 
included into the MOF structure.17,29,30 In this regard, phosphonatebased MOFs are gaining 
interest for designing potential proton conductor.3032 Aryl phosphonic acid linkers provide 
extremely rich and robust metalbinding modes, resulting in a great variety of possible 
structures with unique thermal and chemical stability.3337 Moreover, the uncoordinated oxygen 
atoms of phosphonic acid participate in the formation of Hbond networks with the lattice water 
(solvent) molecules, which facilitate the proton conduction.30
