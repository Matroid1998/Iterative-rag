Description:
Related to parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) and the Monday morning effect at liquid nitrogen temperatures.

Text:
The correct mechanism responsible for CIDNP 
was independently proposed by Closs 4 and Kaptein in 1969 5,6 and it is based on the concept 
of a radical pair. Curiously, parahydrogeninduced polarization (PHIP) was also initially 
misinterpreted this time, as CIDNP 7. It took several years to understand that the Monday 
morning effect, as it was once called, has something to do with parahydrogen (pH2) at liquidN2 
temperatures 8. Today, DNP, CIDNP, and PHIPbased approaches are well understood and are 
widely used for material characterization, drug screening, and molecular imaging among a diverse 
range of various applications.
