Quantum dots (QDs) represent a wellknown class of semiconducting nanomaterials that are 
12 
roughly spherical, possessing unique electronic properties arising from their sizedependent 
13 
band gap (band gap engineering), tunable solubility due to surface functionalization, stable 
14 
fluorescence, and biocompatibility facilitating important diagnostic applications.1 Among them, 
15 
carbon nitride exists in different phases, namely C3N4,  C3N4, cubic C3N4, pseudocubic 
16 
C3N4, and graphitic C3N4 (g C3N4), although the enhanced thermodynamic stability makes the 
17 
last one more interesting specifically to be utilized as a supplement of carbon in aforementioned 
18 
applications.2 Consequentially, gC3N4 quantum dots receive special attention since their 
19 
method of preparation plays a significant role in regulating their electronrich properties,
