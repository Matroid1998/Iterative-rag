Cannabidiol (CBD) has garnered attention as a potential therapy for inflammation,14 can
cer,5,6 and anxiety,79 amongst other diseases and disorders, by targeting various signaling
receptors and pathways.10 Despite a global market size estimated to reach 20 billion by
2025,11 the efficacy of CBD is limited by its solubility and bioavailability. With a water
solubility of 12.6 mgL12 and lipophilicity (logP) of 6.3,13 CBD is classified as a Biophar
maceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II drug.14 Poor water solubility, along with a
significant firstpass effect,15 results in a low oral bioavailability of approximately 6,16 indi
cating that only a small portion of the drug reaches the circulatory system. Improvements to
stabilization and controlled delivery methods for CBD could enhance the viability of certain
treatments.
