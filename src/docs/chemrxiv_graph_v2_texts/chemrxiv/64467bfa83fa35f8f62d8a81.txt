Description:
A flammable and peroxide-forming ethereal solvent.

Many classic organic reactions have been adapted for the mechanochemical approach, 
including the venerable Grignard reaction. In the latter, avoiding or minimizing the use of 
flammable and peroxideforming ethereal solvents (Et2O, THF) leads to substantially 
attenuated safety hazards.6 The mechanochemical Grignard reaction was pioneered by 
Harrowfield and coworkers in 2001,7 who reported the first successful solventfree 
preparation of a naphthyl Grignard reagent followed by its reaction with ketones (Scheme 
1, a). The reaction delivered a mixture of products in addition to the anticipated tertiary 
alcohol, e.g., McMurry coupling and other side processes were observed. Despite a few
