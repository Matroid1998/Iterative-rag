Description:
A flexible metal-organic framework that can switch between open and closed pore phases.

sists of layers of Ni2(COO)4 paddle wheel nodes
interconnected by ndc linkers (Figure 1). The
so formed layers are interconnected in the third
dimension by dabco pillars (right side of Fig
ure 1). The exible form of DUT8(Ni)23 can be
switched between two distinct phases An open
pore (op) and a closed pore (cp) phase. The
phase transition is triggered by ad and desorp
tion of guest molecules.

Description:
A metal-organic framework studied using Ligand Field Molecular Mechanics for its flexibility.

We recently presented
the possibility to perform molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of DUT8(Ni) by employing
Ligand Field Molecular Mechanics (LFMM) for
the description of the metal nodes.25 Alzahrani

ity of LFMM for the description of exibility in
