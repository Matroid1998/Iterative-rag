Description:
Functionality used to direct CH transformations on cycloalkane ring frameworks.

Text:
Baran and Reisman have shown, independently, that reactivity 
augmenting auxiliarydirected CH arylation can be leveraged for 
the synthesis of di and trisubstituted cyclobutane derivatives.8 Fi
nally, Davies and coworkers reported a nondirected CH arylation 
of arylcyclobutanes through the reaction of catalyticallygenerated 
Rhcarbenoids.9 Considering the demonstrated importance of ami
nomethylcyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, harnessing the native 
tertiary amine functionality to direct CH transformations on the 
ring framework would provide a powerful tool for the streamlined 
synthesis of complex variants of these substituted strained cycloal
kanes.
