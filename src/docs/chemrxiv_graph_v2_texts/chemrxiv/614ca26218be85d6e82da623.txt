Description:
Participates in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in energy conversion processes.

in the fields of water oxidation,8,9 CO2 reduction,10 and the 
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).11,12 In lightdriven HER 
catalysis, pioneering studies have demonstrated how su
pramolecular systems can be accessed by combining molec
ular catalysts with molecular photosensitizers. Often, com
ponent interactions are controlled by electrostatics, hydro
gen bonding or stacking.1315 
The design of molecular platforms is a central concept in 
supramolecular energy conversion, including HER, as it en
ables the merging of several functions in one molecule. So
called photochemical dyads utilize these concepts to com
bine photosensitizer, chargetransfer system and HER cata
lyst in one (supra)molecular assembly.16
