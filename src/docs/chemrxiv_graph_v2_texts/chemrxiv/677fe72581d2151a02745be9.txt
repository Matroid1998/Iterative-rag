Description:
Tetrahedra that provide a chemically and thermally stable backbone in porous metallosilicates.

Text:
Porous metallosilicates represent a diverse class of chemically simple yet 
powerful heterogeneous catalysts  partially hollow extended networks generally 
composed of SiO4 and MOx (M  metal) polyhedral.1 The potentially omnidirectional 
bonding between the SiO4 tetrahedra provides a chemically and thermally stable 
backbone which supports porosity and can withstand harsh reaction environments. The silicate networks can accommodate most chemical elements that can form stable 
bonds to oxygen, with the general trend of enhancing the electrophilic character of the 
resulting metal center, attributable to the negative inductive effect of the oxygen. The 
applicability in catalysis and viable synthesis routes depends entirely on the target 
metal, its oxidation state, its chemical environment, and the required porosity of the 
final material.
