Description:
Involved in the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)Akt signaling pathway.

Text:
Cancer is one of the most lethal human diseases accounting for nearly 10 million deaths 
worldwide in 2022.1, 2 The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also known as 
ErbB2, is overexpressed in 20 of all malignancies.3 Overexpression of HER2 receptor has 
been reported in various cancer types, including but not limited to breast,4 gastric,5 ovarian,6 
and lung cancer.7 where it is closely associated with aggressive tumor types and poor 
prognosis in cancer patients. Its activation occurs through dimerization with itself or other 
members of the HER family (EGFR, HER3, or HER4), leading to the activation of downstream 
signaling cascades, such as the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidyl 
inositol 3kinase (PI3K)Akt pathways.
