Description:
Used in microencapsulated nanoparticle form for next-generation antimicrobials.

Introduced in 2020, SilverSil is a broad scope antibacterial solgel material whose 
antibacterial activity so far has been demonstrated in vitro 1. Consisting of 
organically modified silica (ORMOSIL) entrapping silver nanoparticles (NPs) originally 
derived from methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) 1. Colloidal silver (i.e., silver NPs) is a powerful antimicrobial of broad scope and low 
toxicity whose mechanism of action minimizes antimicrobial resistance 2. Accordingly, it comprises the active pharmaceutical ingredient of numerous 
antimicrobial commercial products widely used across the world since more than a 
century. Along with Albo and Trebelsi, we have suggested elsewhere that 
antimicrobial formulations based on microencapsulated Ag NPs will be amid next
generation antimicrobials 3.
