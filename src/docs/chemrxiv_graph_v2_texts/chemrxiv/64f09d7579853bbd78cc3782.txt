Description:
Modern nanostructures studied for their thermoconductive and spectroscopic properties.

Dynamical and thermodynamical properties of carbonbased compounds are subjects of frontline 
research in lowtemperature physics. Academician V.G. Manzhelii was a creator of the scientific school 
of investigations of thermal properties of cryogenic crystals. At present, following novel trends, his 
scholars study thermoconductive and spectroscopic properties of complex molecular compounds, which 
include now modern nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes, onedimensional atomic chains in the 
grooves of carbon nanotube bundles, fullerites and fullerenes, and other carbonbased molecules as 
impurities in polyatomic lattices. Remembering with deep respect V.G. Manzhelii as a prominent scientist 
and a great teacher in life, we dedicate this paper to his memory on the 90th anniversary of his birth.
