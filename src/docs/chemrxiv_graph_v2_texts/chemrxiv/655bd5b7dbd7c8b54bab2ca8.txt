Description:
An inert bath gas used in low-temperature matrix deposition affecting conformer abundance.

Text:
We performed a study on the effects of a given bath gas and the angle of deposition on the 
conformer abundance of CH3ONO during deposition in a lowtemperature matrix using three 
different inert bath gases nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), and xenon (Xe). Our observations indicate a 
change in conformer abundance that occurs between the gas and matrix phases. Changes to 
deposition angle were additionally found to alter conformer abundances in a N2 bath gas, while 
conformer abundances in Ar showed no angular dependence. We investigate the competition 
between effects of surface morphology and energetic stabilization on the trapping of the two 
conformers by analyzing the angular dependence of the abundances and performing quantum 
chemistry calculations of the gasCH3ONO complexes.
