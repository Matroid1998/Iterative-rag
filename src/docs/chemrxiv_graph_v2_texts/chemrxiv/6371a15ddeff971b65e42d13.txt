of the 
THBT unit containing saturated CH2CH2 moieties is crucial for the successful cyclization 
reaction. The increased strain energy in the last oxidative dehydrogenative step can be partially 
compensated by the gained aromatic stabilization energy. In addition, the average strain energy 
for each twist in the triply twisted MCNB 1 is around 34.6 kcalmol, which is smaller than that in 
the singly twisted (25,25)MCNB (49.4 kcalmol).25 Moreover, the strain could be visualized along 
the molecular backbone through StrainViz developed by Jasti and coworkers.35 As shown in 
Fig. 4ab and Fig. S18, the total strain energy of 2a2b is calculated as 110.8 kcalmol, while the 
maximum strain energy of an individual bond is 1.9 kcalmol.
