Description:
A stimuli-responsive polymer that changes conformation with variations in pH.

Text:
To impart selfregulated separation properties, membranes can be fabricated from polymers that adapt 
their structure in response to the physicochemical conditions in the local environment.9 Stimuli
responsive polymers such as polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyvinyl alcohol or poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) 
change their conformation upon variations in pH10, temperature11, or the exposure to light12. For 
example, the stimuliresponsive swelling of hydrogel polymer membranes allows to control the 
permeation of fluids13,14, the gating of ions15,16 and the rejection of small molecules17.
