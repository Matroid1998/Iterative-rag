Description:
Synthesized using physical vapor deposition for X-ray detection and digital imaging.

Text:
Bismuth iodides and oxyiodides have been subjects of many recent studies exploring 
applications such as radiation detection, digital imaging, photovoltaics and catalysis. They have 
been synthesized as polycrystalline powders, large single crystals or thin films. Among the 
early reports of synthesis of BiI3 are studies from Singh et al 1 and Chaudhuri et al 2 who 
iodinated solution grown Bi2S3. Wang et al 3 synthesized BiI3 by a hydrothermal protocol 
and explored their use for roomtemperature Xray detection. Studies have also been carried 
out on bismuth iodide synthesized using physical vapor deposition (typically involving a 
modified vertical Bridgman method) for Xray detection and digital imaging 47. Similar 
studies have also been carried out for radiation detection using BiI3 8, 9.

Description:
Prepared using a low-temperature solvothermal technique for organic photovoltaic cells.

There has also 
been a significant interest in the exploration of BiI3 as a photovoltaic material 10. This is 
accomplished typically either by converting it into a methyl ammonium compound (see, for 
instance, 11) and further doping it 12, or by preparing organicinorganic hybrid systems 
13 or by directly using it in an organic photovoltaic cell 10, 14. The latter study uses a 
lowtemperature solvothermal technique to prepare bismuth iodide. Recently, Wei et al 15 
have used PVDsynthesized 2D layered nanoplates of BiI3 for visiblelight photodetection. Bismuth iodide has also been explored as catalysts for deprotection of acetals and ketals 16. Finally, bismuth iodide nanowires have been obtained by calcination of a sonochemically
synthesized supramolecular precursor in a study by Soltanzadeh and Morsali 17.
