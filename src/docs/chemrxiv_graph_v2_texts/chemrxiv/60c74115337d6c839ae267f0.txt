Description:
Generated by electrolysis or photoelectrolysis of water and used for energy storage.

Due to the severe consequences of the climate change by the excessive use of fossil fuels, the 
energy system of mankind has to be transformed into a renewable one.1,2 The best and easiest 
way is the generation of renewable energy from sunlight, wind, water, waves, and biomass. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like sun light, wind, and 
waves, the storage of electrical or chemical energy is needed.3,4 An obvious way is, to generate 
hydrogen by electrolysis or photoelectrolysis of water and to store it. For a prospective indus
trial implementation of the photoelectrolysis of water large area photoelectrode materials have 
to be developed.
