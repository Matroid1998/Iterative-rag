Description:
A metal that can at least double the overall battery gravimetric energy density when used in place of graphite in batteries.

Text:
Developing batteries with higher energy densities is vital for electric transportation and a renewable
powered electric grid.1 Replacing graphite anode (in current lithiumion batteries) with lithium metal can 
at least double the overall battery gravimetric energy density.2 Hence, there has been fervent research to 
develop rechargeable lithium metal batteries.

Description:
A metal used in rechargeable batteries, known for its high energy density.

Text:
However, prior efforts to commercialize rechargeable lithium 
metal batteries failed primarily because of the volatile, flammable liquid electrolytes, and the inability to 
prevent lithium dendrite growth upon metal deposition.3 Designing solid state lithium metal batteries can 
alleviate these safety and morphological challenges, while maintaining high energy density.35 Solid state 
electrolytes (SSEs) should support high ion conductivity ( 103 Scm), be mechanically flexible and thin 
( 25 m), and have a wide electrochemical stability window (04.5 V vs LiLi).3 Currently, inorganic 
SSEs such as phosphates (e.g., LATP), oxides (LLZO),6 and sulfides7 have been studied heavily.3,4 
Although inorganics such as sulfides have ion conductivities on the order of 102  103 Scm,8 no single 
class of inorganic electrolytes meets all the requirements.9,10 
Polymer electrolytes are easy to process as a standalone SSE, as part of an inorganicpolymer hybrid 
electrolyte,11,12 or as a binder for the cathode composite.13,14 Furthermore, they can be mechanically flexible 
and fabricated in thin form factors.

Description:
Exhibits higher transference number in the perfluoroether backbone indicating weaker coordination compared to traditional PEG.

Text:
Polycarbonates such as polyethylene carbonate have been explored, but still suffer from low room 
temperature ionic conductivity and poor oxidative stability.2022 
Recently, we synthesized a new class of fluorinatedether smallmoleculeelectrolytes that show high ionic 
conductivity and high oxidative stability.2325 This finding prompted us to explore solid perfluoropolyether 
(PFPE) as a polymer electrolyte. While polycarbonates have been extensively studied,2022,26 there has been 
limited work on solid PFPE.18,27 Previous work27 has shown that crosslinked PFPE can support ion 
transport, albeit still with low conductivities (105 Scm). And previous solution state work done by some 
of us23 and Balsara and coworkers28,29 have shown higher lithium transference number in the perfluoroether 
backbone indicating weaker lithium coordination of the polymer backbone compared to the traditional PEG.

Description:
A cation in salt-in-polymer electrolytes with typically lower mobility compared to the anion.

Text:
Saltinpolymer electrolytes involve a lithium 
salt dissolved in a polymer and usually suffer from low lithium transference numbers (with higher mobility 
of the anion compared to the cation under an electric field).13 To improve the transference number, single
ionpolyelectrolytes have been developed that immobilize the salt anion within the polymer backbone 
making the lithium ion the only mobile species, leading to a lithium transference number close to unity.30,31 
In this work, we fabricated singleion and saltinpolymer PFPE, with the tethered TFSI anion and LiTFSI 
salt dissolved (Figure 1), respectively. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR was used to study polymer 
environment, the lithium ion solvation structure and activation barrier for ion transport.32 MAS NMR 
provides high chemical shift resolution for these solid polymers and enables an understanding of ion
