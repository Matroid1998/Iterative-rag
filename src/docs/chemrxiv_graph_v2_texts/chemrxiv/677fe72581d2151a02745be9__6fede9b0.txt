Description:
A spherosilicate consisting of a double 4-ring core used as a molecular building block for nanoporous materials.

Text:
A spherosilicate consisting of a double 4ring core (D4R, Si8O20) with every 
vertex functionalized with a suitable reactive group has attracted significant attention 
as a molecular building block for constructing a whole array of nanoporous materials.2
5 By direct crosslinking these cubic units into 3dimensional infinite networks, 
microporous materials have been obtained, while mesoporous systems can be 
prepared with templates or longalkyl chain substituents.
