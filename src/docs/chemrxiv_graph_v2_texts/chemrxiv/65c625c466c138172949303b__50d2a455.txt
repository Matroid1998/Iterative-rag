Description:
Used in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) but limited by low natural abundance and high cost.

However, these enzymes often lack 
stability under air and their synthesis on a large scale is usually difficult, thus limiting their 
practical application.2,3 On the other hand, despite their very high efficiency in the 
electrocatalytic HER, platinumbased catalysts are not applicable on a large scale due to the 
low natural abundance and high cost of platinum.4 As a result, the development of efficient and 
robust catalysts comprising earthabundant metals such as Fe,5 Co,6 Ni,7 Cu,8 Zn,9 Mn10 and 
Mo11 for the electrochemical HER is a focus of current research.
