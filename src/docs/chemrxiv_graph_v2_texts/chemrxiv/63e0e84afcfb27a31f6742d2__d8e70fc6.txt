Lamellar materials with strong covalent in-plane bonding and weak van der Waals interlayer interaction, relevant for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis.

Text:
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are lamellar materials with strong covalent inplane bonding and weak 
van der Waals interlayer interaction, classifying them as van der Waals solids.1,2 Tunable bandgap, high carrier 
mobility, and large surface area make these materials relevant for different applications in electronics,3 
optoelectronics,4 and catalysis.5 In addition, because they can possess metastable crystal structures (octahedral 
or distorted octahedral), they are candidates for a considerable number of applications, such as hydrogen 
evolution reaction (HER) and electrode materials for sodium ion batteries.68 
As a consequence of different bonding energies (strong inplane and weak interlayer bonding), isolation of single 
monolayers is achievable, which creates a high surface area, induces quantum confinement and bandgap 
transformation.9 This alluring feature results from a lack of symmetry due to the reduction in the size to a single 
monolayer.10,11 Due to these unique properties and numerous potential applications of TMDCs monolayers, the 
preparation of single layer materials and control of their size have attracted much attention.12,13 
Different thin layer preparation techniques have been developed and applied over the years, such as exfoliation 
techniques,14,15 substrate growth techniques,16,17 and colloidal synthesis.18 But so far, no studies have succeeded 
in synthesizing sizecontrolled and welldispersed nanomonolayers.
