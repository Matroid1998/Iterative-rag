Forms films with optical bandgaps between 1.3 and 1.6 eV, independent of Ni2 concentration.

Interestingly, we observed that the mixing of NiI2 
and PbI2 precursors did not produce uniformly mixed films in the solidstate, as analyzed by X
ray diffraction and visible absorption studies. We report optical bandgaps for the Ni2 substituted 
films between 1.3 and 1.6 eV, which appear to be independent of the Ni2 concentration. Furthermore, we observe quenching of emission from MAPbI3 upon Ni2 substitution, indicating 
the Ni2 may act as a recombination center for charge carriers. Lastly, the Ni2 substituted films 
displayed high sensitivity to water, as observed by rapid color changes of the films on exposure 
to ambient conditions. Thus, despite the optimal bandgap and structure of the materials, we
