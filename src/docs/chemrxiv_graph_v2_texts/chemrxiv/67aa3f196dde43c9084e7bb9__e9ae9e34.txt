Description:
A structural motif in oligonuclear metal complexes involved in superexchange mechanisms.

Text:
Oxo and hydroxobridged oligonuclear metal centers are structural motifs commonly en
countered in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry.15 In these magnetic complexes, un
paired electrons localised at transition metal centers can interact either through direct
exchange, where the d orbitals of different metal sites overlap spatially, or through su
perexchange mechanisms (Figure 1). These kinds of mechanism are indirect magnetic in
teractions mediated by doubly occupied ligand orbitals that bridge the metal centers, en
abling spin alignment through virtual electron hopping.6,7 For example, a previous study
on the Mn(III)2(O)(OAc)2(Me3tacn)22 complex identified three significant superex
change pathways two symmetric  pathways involving orbitals perpendicular to the Mn2O2
plane and a mixed inplane  pathway.8 In general, direct exchange is much more rare for
oligonuclear metal complexes than superexchange.
