Atorvastatin (ATV) 1 is one of the best selling drug belonging to the class
of statins 2, 3 widely administered over more than 25 years in a variety of
settings to lower the bad cholesterol and fats e.g., lowdensity lipoprotein
(LDL), triglycerides , decrease the risk of heart disease, prevent strokes and
heart attacks, etc 4, 5, 6, 7. Quantum chemistry can provide important insight into the antioxidant ac
tivity of ATV, which still remained elusive. For this reason, the rst eorts in
this direction undertaken only recently 8 are certainly welcome. Unfortunately,
the results presented in ref. 8 are plagued by serious aws, and drawing atten
tion to this fact is an important aim of the present communication.
