Description:
Atoms in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can be substituted with heteroatoms to enhance stability.

Text:
One of the most effective strategies for enhancing the stability of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) involves substituting some of their carbon atoms with main group
element heteroatoms, such as sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), boron (B), or phosphorus (P).6,7 Such
heteroatom substitution not only significantly improves their stability but also endows the
resulting polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds with a broad spectrum of properties that are
unattainable by their purely hydrocarbon analogues. Besides finetuning the electronic
structure, heteroatoms can improve molecular packing, and processability, opening new
avenues for material design and application.
