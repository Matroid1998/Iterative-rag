Description:
Synthesized by some bacteria during fermentation processes.

Globally, fermented 
foods play an important role in human nutrition, accounting for approximately 2040 of the 
worlds food supply (Fagbemi et al., 2005). It is widely regarded as an effective food processing 
method that not only boosts nutrient content and sensory characteristics, but also minimizes 
the risk of contamination from pathogens and toxins (Abegaz et al., 2002; Hasan et al., 2014). During fermentation processes, the chemical composition of raw materials is significantly 
altered, with changes occurring in its content, inclusive of its mineral elements and vitamins. The type of compounds formed during fermentation depends on the type of microorganisms 
involved; for instance, some bacteria synthesizes vitamins such as vitamin B and C, during 
fermentation process, resulting in a more nutritious fermented food product.
