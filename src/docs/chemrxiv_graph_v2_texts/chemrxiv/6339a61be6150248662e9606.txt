Description:
Forms one-dimensional linear molecules connected by sp-hybridized carbon atoms.

Text:
Carbon chains are onedimensional linear molecules of the generic formula 
R(CC)nR connected by sphybridized carbon atoms. The Hcapped ones, 
H(CC)nH, is the simplest form of a variety of endsubstituted carbon chains. They 
are sometimes referred to as polyacetylenes in the literature, which is an error because 
the polymer with the formula (HCCH)n actually is polyacetylene, while the exact 
name of H(CC)nH should be polyyne. Early exploration found that Hcapped carbon chains are of relevance in the 
chemistry of dense interstellar clouds and these highly unsaturated polymers 
contribute significantly to the astrochemical evolution of the interstellar medium 1. Moreover, they are also detected as intermediates in the formation of polyaromatic 
hydrocarbons and fullerenes 2.

Description:
Forms H-capped chains with size-dependent electronic and optical characteristics.

Previous experiments in different media such as gas phase (n  113) 1820, 
solution (n  210, 12) 18,21, and neon matrix (n  612) 22 have observed the 
absorption spectra of several H(CC)nH chains and demonstrated their 
sizedependent electronic and optical characteristics. Also, there were some 
theoretical studies on the size dependence of the electronic excitation energies and 
oscillator strengths of the Hcapped carbon chains 23,24. But, perhaps limited by the 
analytical means at that time, almost all the reports were merely on location and 
assignment of the absorption band, and there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis 
of the sizedependent optical characteristics. Furthermore, it is of great theoretical and
