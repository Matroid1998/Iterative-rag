Description:
A molecule that can bring the phosphate group of an incoming nucleotide closer to the 3' end of a primer by conformational constraints.

Text:
The
initial mechanistic rationale was that such a downstream
oligonucleotide (or even mononucleotide) could bring closer
phosphate group of incoming nucleotide to the 3 end of a
primer by conformational constraints inducing the forma
tion of 35 phosphodiester linkages 30. Furthermore, it
was demonstrated that monomers and and helper oligonu
cleotides activated with 2aminoimidazole yielded the high
est rates of primer extension reaction 31 (Fig. 1 a) and b)). However, 2aminoimidazole itself did not improve the rates
and fidelities of nonenzymatic RNA selfreplication of the A
and U components. Increased rate and fidelity of nonenzymatic primer ex
tension of the A and U monomers was achieved with the
consideration of alternative activated nucleotides such as
