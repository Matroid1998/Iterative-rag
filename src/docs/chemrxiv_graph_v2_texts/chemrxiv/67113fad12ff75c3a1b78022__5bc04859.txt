ammonia production operations have been optimized for energy efficiency in very large in
dustrial facilities.6,7 The HB reaction proceeds under elevated temperature (350550 C)
and high pressure (150350 atm) on an iron or ruthenium catalyst to ensure faster reaction
rates in producing the NH3.810 It relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily natural gas) and
releases over 438.5  37.1 metric tons of the greenhouse gas CO2 annually (2022), accounts
for about 2 of total energy consumption in 2020, and 1.3 of global CO2 emissions.3,11,12
A substantial amount of ammonia becomes a feedstock for nitric acid (HNO3) which is
also a high demand Ncontaining chemical, via the Ostwald process.1315 The reliable, energy
efficient Ostwald process for manufacturing nitric acid consists of a high temperature (over
