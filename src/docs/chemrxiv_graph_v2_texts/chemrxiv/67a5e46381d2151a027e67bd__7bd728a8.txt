Description:
A product of the depolymerization of polyester by PETase.

Text:
Remarkably, PETase has also 
demonstrated significant hydrolytic activity against PEF,13 depolymerizing this semiaromatic polyester into 
mono(2hydroxyethyl furanoate) (MHEF), bis(2hydroxyethyl furanoate) (BHEF) and 25 furandicarboxylic 
acid (FDCA) and ethylene glycol (EG; Figure 1B).14 
From a structural point of view, PETase resembles the folding of an  hydrolase, characterized by a 
central ninestranded twisted strand, surrounded by seven helices.13,1517 The catalysis is exerted by a 
catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues (S160, H237, and D206) in the active 
site, which encompasses also the residues tryptophane, tyrosine, methionine and isoleucine (W185, Y87, 
M161, and I208) to support the substrate recognition and binding15 (Figure 1C).
