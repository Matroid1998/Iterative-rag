Description:
Molecular motifs known for their high chemical, thermal, and biological stability, used in material science, bioconjugation, drug design, catalysis, and supramolecular chemistry.

Text:
1,2,3Triazoles are incredibly popular molecular motifs that have 
found widespread application in a diverse range of fields, 
including material science, bioconjugation, drug design, catalysis 
and supramolecular chemistry.1 One reason for the use of 
1,2,3triazoles in these fields is their high chemical, thermal and 
biological stability, however they can also perform important 
functions.

Description:
Applied as metabolically stable bioisosteres for amides, esters, carboxylic acids, alkenes, and other heterocycles.

Text:
For example, 1,2,3triazoles have been applied as 
metabolicallystable bioisosteres for amides, esters, carboxylic 
acids, alkenes and other heterocycles;2 whilst their high hole 
affinity and Hbond donor properties have led to applications in 
electronics and anion recognition, respectively.3 
The immense range of applications of 1,2,3triazoles can be also 
attributed to the ease of their synthesis through the Nobel Prize 
winning Cucatalysed azidealkyne cycloaddition reaction.4 In 
contrast to the thermal Huisgen azidealkyne cycloaddition,5 the 
Cucatalysed variant provides excellent yield and regioselectivity 
for 1,4substituted triazoles, and can be performed at room 
temperature in a range of solvents, including water, allowing its 
use in bioconjugation applications.1c 
Bistriazoletriazolium scaffolds as halogenchalcogen bond 
donors in anion binding and catalysis have recently received 
significant attention and application.6 As part of an ongoing 
program into the design of new chalcogen bond donors, we 
were interested in the synthesis and functionalisation of related 
bistriazoles bearing electronwithdrawing Nsubstituents (Figure 
1A).
