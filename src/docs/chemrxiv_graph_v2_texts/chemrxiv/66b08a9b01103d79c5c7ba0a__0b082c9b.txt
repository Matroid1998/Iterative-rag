Description:
Compounds whose primary producers are marine animals, not symbionts.

Recent studies have shifted focus to biosynthesis
61 
related investigations, aiming first to determine whether symbionts or marine animals 
62 
are the primary producers of these terpenoids1518. This investigation led to a surprising 
63 
discovery corals and sponges contain active terpene synthases (TSs) in their genomes, 
64 
enabling them to produce terpene scaffolds independently, debunking the previous 
65 
theory that microbial or algal symbionts were primarily responsible1517. This finding 
66 
substantiates that marine animals are indeed the true producers of these compounds. 67 
Professor Eric W. Schmidt has further engaged in biomimetic research, focusing on 
68 
eunicellane scaffolds by utilizing engineered yeast cultures that incorporate eunicellane 
69 
TS derived from corals19. 70 
In terms of terpene cyclization mechanisms, TSs initiate carbocation formation through 
71 
two primary pathways.
