Developing systems capable of generating solar fuels is becoming imperative due to the 
increasing global energy demand.1 Inspired by natural photosynthesis, a viable path towards 
sustainable chemical productions is to design artificial processes that convert solar light into 
chemical energy.2 Another point to take inspiration from natural photosynthesis is also the 
organization of photofunctional chromophores and catalysts into light harvesting systems.37 
In this context, the selfassembly of synthetic chromophores into organic semiconductors is 
gaining momentum for the development of photocatalytic systems for solar fuels 
production.4,819 The appealing properties of selfassembled organic semiconductors originate 
both from the monomers chemical structures, which give molecular precision and allow the 
customization of the desired properties through molecular design, and from nanostructures 
arising from their selfassembly,2024 in which molecular packing can aid exciton 
delocalization upon light irradiation.25 
Since different molecular packing in organic semiconductors alters their lightharvesting 
properties, several studies have explored the relationship between molecular aggregation, the 
resulting nanostructures, and photocatalytic activity.26 For example, an amphiphilic perylene 
monoimide (PMI) derivative showed different photocatalytic proton reduction activity 
depending on its morphology.27 The more active morphology was associated with the 
formation of chargetransfer excitons, with the separation of electrons and holes over stacked 
molecules making more efficient electrons transfer to a proton reduction catalyst.
