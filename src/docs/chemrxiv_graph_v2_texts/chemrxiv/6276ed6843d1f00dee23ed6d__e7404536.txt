Description:
Deactivated electrophiles that can be employed in catalysis with high levels of efficiency.

Text:
Additionally, they 
also can stabilize the unsaturated metal center via interactions 
with the phosphines psystem (a pseudobidentate binding 
mode).11,12,14,15 Most members of this ligand class are also 
characterized by a high degree of conformational flexibility, 
resulting in a wide range of attainable steric environments 
around the metal center (Figure 1B),12,13 which can be limited 
by introducing groups on the A ring or increasing the size of the 
alkyl groups bound to phosphorus.13,16 Overall, the design 
elements of these ligands promote challenging elementary steps 
while minimizing offcycle speciation,9,10 and allow for 
deactivated electrophiles such as aryl chlorides to be employed 
in catalysis with high levels of efficiency.

Description:
Involved in Suzuki-Miyaura Coupling reactions using Buchwald-type phosphines.

Text:
Over the past decade, Buchwaldtype phosphines have also 
found successful application in a limited number of Ni
catalyzed crosscoupling reactions (Figure 1C).1725 One of the 
first reports came from our lab in 2011 with the development of 
a Nicatalyzed crosscoupling of styrenyl epoxides and boronic 
acids, where BrettPhos was identified to be the most effective 
ligand in the transformation.18 The Watson and Crudden labs 
have also reported the use of Buchwaldtype phosphines in Ni
catalyzedcross 
coupling 
reactions 
of 
naphthylic 
pseudohalides.19,20 More recently, researchers at Bristol Myers 
Squibb identified CyJohnPhos as the most effective ligand for 
the Nicatalyzed borylation of aryl halides, with other examples 
of the ligand class amongst the top performers.21 Additionally, 
in a recent collaborative project carried out by our lab, the 
Sigman lab, and Merck  Co., Inc., we identified certain 
Buchwaldtype phosphines as top performing among 90 diverse 
monophosphines for several SuzukiMiyaura Coupling 
reactions (SMC) of aryl chlorides.25 
While these examples illustrate that Buchwald ligands are 
capable of imparting desirable reactivity in Nicatalyzed 
methodologies, little is known about their SRRs in Ni catalysis, 
or how their unique structure and binding modes interface with 
Ni more generally.
