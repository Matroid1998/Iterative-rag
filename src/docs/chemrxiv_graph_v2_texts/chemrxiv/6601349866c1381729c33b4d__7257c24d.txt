Description:
Used in cross-coupling due to its high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility.

Despite the relatively high cost of 
palladium, traditional methods have favoured its use in crosscoupling due to its high catalytic 
activity, substrate compatibility, and the broad range of transformations that are possible.1 More 
recently, however, in the search for catalytic systems that rely on earthabundant metals, nickel has 
emerged as a valuable alternative to palladium for crosscoupling.2,3 In addition to its lower cost and 
greater abundance, nickel possesses a different reactivity profile to palladium displaying a reduced 
propensity of Nialkyl intermediates to undergo hydride elimination, and possessing a broader 
array of accessible oxidation states (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), meaning that both two and oneelectron redox 
processes are possible.46 These properties mean that nickel is now often the metal of choice for 
metallaphotoredox C(sp2)C(sp3) bond formation, with seminal examples being reported in 2014 by 
both Molander, using potassium trifluoroborate salts, and MacMillan and Doyle, using carboxylic 
acids as radical precursors, along with aryl halides, to form new bonds using a dual nickeliridium 
catalysed system (Scheme 1A).7,8 Since then, a wide variety of radical precursors as coupling partners 
has been reported, expanding the possible synthetic disconnections available for synthetic chemists.8

Despite the use of an earth abundant base metal catalyst, metallaphotoredox methods with nickel still 
often rely on the use of preciousmetal iridiumbased photocatalysts.18 The high cost and relative 
scarcity of iridium often becomes an overriding factor in the use of these procedures, which becomes 
increasingly problematic as scale increases.
