In this context, Cooper and coworkers have recently reported 
the selfassembly of a donoracceptor dye and its morphologydependent photocatalytic 
activity.29 The aggregated dye was able to catalyze H2 evolution (31.8 mmol g1 h1) when it 
was assembled as ordered nanorods, while H2O2 was produced with amorphous spheres (3.20 
mmol g1 h1). Specifically, it was proposed that there are two different packing modes, which 
lead to different charge transfer extent. The study opened the avenue for emerging novel self
