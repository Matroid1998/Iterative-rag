Description:
Undergoes structural phase transitions under pressure.

We will test this hypothesis on the MB6 hexaborides (M  Ca, Sr, Ba) as they have been
shown to undergo structural phase transitions under pressure.1013
Pressure is a powerful probe of structureproperty relationships in solid state materials, and
has come under special attention due to reports of hightemperature superconductivity in
metal hydrides.1417 Metal hexaborides MB6 have been synthesized for multiple sblock and
fblock metals, and display varied electron transport properties superconductivity (YB6),18
topological Kondo insulation (SmB6),13,19 and complex magnetism (CeB6, EuB6).20,21 High
pressure experiments, in conjunction with electronic structure calculations, have been used to
study magnetism in EuB6 and GdB6,22 and metalinsulator transitions in SmB6 and YB6.23
Structural transformations under pressure have also been studied experimentally and theo
retically, particularly for sblock hexaborides.1013 To understand the relationships between
