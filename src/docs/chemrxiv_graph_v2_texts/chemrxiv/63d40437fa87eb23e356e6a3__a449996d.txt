Description:
Function as alkylation radical precursors in transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

Olefins are important substructures in synthetic organic 
chemistry, polymer chemistry and medicinal chemistry, and are 
omnipresent in natural products and pharmaceuticals.1 Also C
vinyl glycosides, which are a central class of vinylated 
carbohydrates, are present in many natural products and 
pharmaceuticals.2 While transition metal catalysis is ubiquitous 
in alkene synthesis,3 the achievement of high regio and 
stereoselectivity, as well as broad functional group tolerance, 
constitute some of the main synthetic challenges.4 
Visiblelight mediated photocatalysis has in recent years 
become an impressive strategy for the synthesis of complex 
organic molecules, enabling novel reaction pathways and mild 
reaction conditions.5 Indeed, photocatalytic synthetic routes to 
olefins have been investigated extensively,6 and commonly 
involve a transition metalcatalyzed crosscoupling between 
alkylaryl halides or styrenes and alkylation radical precursors 
such as carboxylic acids, 4alkyldihydropyridines (4alkylDHPs) 
or alkyl silicates (Scheme 1a).
