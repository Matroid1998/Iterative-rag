Description:
Serves as a surface for the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen, crucial in car exhaust catalysts and fuel cells.

The adsorption and dissoci
ation of oxygen on platinum surfaces are of signicant
technological importance, as they not only constitute cru
cial reaction steps in the car exhaust catalyst 25, but
they are also relevant for the oxygen reduction reaction
in fuel cells in aqueous environments 2630. Molecular
oxygen can adsorb both molecularly and dissociatively on
Pt(111) 8, 31. At low surface temperatures, however,
oxygen does not directly dissociate on Pt(111), even if
impinging with high kinetic energies 8, 32, 33. Rather,
it rst adsorbs molecularly due to steric hindrance caused
by the shape of the underlying potential energy surface,
and only in a second step dissociates caused by thermal
uctuations, as demonstrated in tightbinding molecular
dynamics studies 34, 35.
