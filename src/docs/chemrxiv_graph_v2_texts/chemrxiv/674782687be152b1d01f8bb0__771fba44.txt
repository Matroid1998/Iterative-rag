Ethylene is one of the most important platform chemicals due to its application as monomer in 
35 
polymer production and as reactant for the production of intermediate products such as 
36 
dichloroethane, ethylene oxide, ethyl benzene and vinyl acetate.1,2 The conventional route for the 
37 
production of ethylene is the cracking of naphta or recently, the production from bioethanol by 
38 
dehydration. The cracking conditions mainly favour the formation of olefins as well as the 
39 
formation of smaller amounts of multi unsaturated compounds.1 High purity ethylene streams are 
40 
required especially in polymer production to ensure reproducible product qualities.

Description:
Produced with high selectivity by converting acetylene with low hydrogen concentration.

Text:
Multi
41 
unsaturated impurities such as acetylene lead to poisoning of ZieglerNatta catalysts in 
42 
polymerization reactions.35 Therefore, the generation of ethylenerich streams with acetylene 
43 
concentrations lower than 1 ppm are necessary.37 
44 
Industrially, two main operating methods are commonly used for acetylene removal, tailend and 
45 
frontend operation. In the first case, the acetylene removal unit is located after the deethanizer. 46 
The feed contains only C2fractions and stoichiometrically added hydrogen.610 The low hydrogen 
47 
concentration guarantees a high selectivity for conversion of acetylene to ethylene avoiding the 
48 
overhydrogenation to ethane. However, it favors increased oligomer and green oil formation 
49 
leading to shorter catalyst lifetimes in the acetylene hydrogenation.
