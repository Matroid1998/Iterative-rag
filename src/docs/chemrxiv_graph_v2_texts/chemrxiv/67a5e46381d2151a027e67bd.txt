Description:
A product of PET cleavage by PETase.

Text:
In the last years, an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to conventional 
methods has been offered by enzymatic degradation.9 Several bacterial enzymes were discovered able to 
cleave the polymeric plastic chains, including cutinases, lipases, and esterases, and grouped in the family 
of PEThydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs).10,11 A breakthrough in this field occurred in 2016 with the discovery 
of a bacterium, named Ideonella Sakaiensis 201F6 that used PET as a major nutrient thanks to the 
secretion of two hydrolases PETase and MHETase.12 Working synergistically, PETase cleaves the PET 
chains mainly into mono(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (MHET), bis(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET), 
terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG; Figure 1A), whereas MHETase completes the process, 
converting MHET and BHET into their minimal chemical moieties.

Description:
A product of the depolymerization of polyester by PETase.

Text:
Remarkably, PETase has also 
demonstrated significant hydrolytic activity against PEF,13 depolymerizing this semiaromatic polyester into 
mono(2hydroxyethyl furanoate) (MHEF), bis(2hydroxyethyl furanoate) (BHEF) and 25 furandicarboxylic 
acid (FDCA) and ethylene glycol (EG; Figure 1B).14 
From a structural point of view, PETase resembles the folding of an  hydrolase, characterized by a 
central ninestranded twisted strand, surrounded by seven helices.13,1517 The catalysis is exerted by a 
catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues (S160, H237, and D206) in the active 
site, which encompasses also the residues tryptophane, tyrosine, methionine and isoleucine (W185, Y87, 
M161, and I208) to support the substrate recognition and binding15 (Figure 1C).
