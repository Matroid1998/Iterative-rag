In light of the burgeoning availability of low cost solar electricity, a particularly timely 
challenge is the generation of materials that competently catalyze fuelforming small molecule 
transformations which enable the storage of electricity as chemical energy.16 This chemical 
energy subsequently requires a corresponding set of materials to catalyze the conversion of this 
chemical energy back into electricity in a device known as a fuel cell.79 One of these reactions, 
the reduction of oxygen to water, is essential to proton exchange membrane fuel cell 
technologies, but significant research efforts are still required to make these technologies a 
reality.10 Platinum remains the bestinclass catalyst for O2 reduction, but its relatively high cost 
and low abundance are prohibitive to widespread adoption.10 In its place, various firstrow 
transition metal and metalfree alternatives have been considered.1113 
Among these alternative catalyst paradigms, nitrogendoped carbon materials stand out as 
durable, lowcost, highactivity and highefficiency catalysts for oxygen reduction.14,15 These 
structures come in various forms, including nitrogendoped fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and 
graphene.16,17 Regardless of type, though, these materials are intrinsically heterogeneous, 
featuring mixtures of pyridinelike, pyrrolelike and graphiticquaternary nitrogen sites.18 This has 
complicated the study of active sites in these catalysts, rendering the rational iteration and 
improvement of these materials more difficult.

Description:
Forms bonds with O2 in nitrogen-doped graphite conjugated catalysts.

Text:
To address this gap, the development of 
designer nitrogendoped materials with welldefined active sites has been pursued by multiple 
groups.19,20 
These studies support the critical conclusion that carbons adjacent to pyridinic moieties are 
responsible for the oxygen reduction activity in these catalysts but raised further questions 
about the source of this activity. In the case of a previous study by Ricke et al. which focused on 
one particular nitrogendoped graphite conjugated catalyst (NGCC), there was only a single 
carbon atom in the catalyst that would form a bond with O2.19 This activity could not be solely a 
result of the pyridinic nitrogen acting as an orthopara activator to the aromatic system, as the 
alternate carbon ortho to the pyridinic nitrogen would not bind O2.

Description:
Active carbon with significant accumulation of spin density, indicating stable electron donation to O2.

Text:
This study noted that the 
active carbon had a significant accumulation of spin density, which the authors interpreted as 
indicating this site could most stably donate electron density to O2 during bond formation. In this work, we build on this understanding to choose a set of structural and electronic features 
which we hypothesize could predict oxygen binding and ORR activity in nitrogendoped carbon 
materials.
