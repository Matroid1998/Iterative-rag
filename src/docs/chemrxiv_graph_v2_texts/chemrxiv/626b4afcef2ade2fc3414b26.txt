Description:
Based complexes in pentagonal bipyramidal geometry with fluorinated axial ligands.

The 
difficulty remains in distinguishing the contribution from the 
Orbach process. Hence, a system with an almost fixed Orbach 
process is critical. Herein, we report a family of Dy(III)based complexes in 
pentagonalbipyramidal geometry with fluorinated axial ligands
