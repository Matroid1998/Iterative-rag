Description:
Thioethers from L-cysteine and L-methionine are implicated in radical damage and repair mechanisms.

Text:
In addition, 
free thiol groups and thioethers from Lcysteine 
and Lmethionine are implicated in radical 
damage and repair mechanisms.6,7 
The disulfide UVphotochemistry has been 
the topic of many studies which have focused on 
the reactions that may result when breaking SS 
or CS bonds and forming the respective thiyl or 
perthiyl radicals8. The picture emerging from the 
sum of static and timeresolved studies 
conducted over a time span of nearly 75 years is
