Description:
Exhibits a qualitatively similar but weaker hyperporphyrin effect with anionic phenoxide substituents injecting negative charge into the neutral porphyrin core.

Text:
Hypsoporphyrins exhibit blueshifted spectral features relative to normal porphyrins,3,5 while 
hyperporphyrins exhibit redshifted spectral features andor extra bands relative to normal porphyrins.3 
There are also many examples of freebase porphyrins that exhibit hyperporphyrin effects, most 
commonly with strongly electrondonating substituents that can be either protonated or deprotonated.6 
For example, centrally diprotonated mesotetrakis(4aminophenyl)porphyrin (H2TAPP) exhibits a 
dramatic hyperporphyrin spectrum with a strong NIR transition attributed to charge transfer from the 
aminophenyl groups to the dipositive porphyrin core.7 A qualitatively similar, but weaker, effect is 
observed for deprotonated mesotetrakis(4hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2THPP), in which the anionic 
phenoxide substituents conjugatively inject negative charge into the neutral porphyrin core.8,9,10,11,12 
These effects can be qualitatively appreciated with simple resonance forms.
