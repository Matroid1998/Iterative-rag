Description:
Two-dimensional materials with bond-free van der Waals structures and relatively large carrier mobilities.

Fast photodetectors that convert an onchip optical signal into an electrical 
output at highspeed are vital for modern imaging, sensing, and communication 
systems1. Operation at telecom wavelengths is especially preferred due to low 
transmission losses and the availability of optical gain. Twodimensional (2D) 
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with bondfree van der Waals (vdW) 
structures possess relatively large carrier mobilities24 and intrinsic response times on 
the order of picoseconds57, demonstrating great potential for the next generation of 
ultrafast photodetectors. One of the most important challenges for the development of information 
technology is the large heat dissipation caused by longdistance data transmission and 
fast signal conversion in high densities8.
