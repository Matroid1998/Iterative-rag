Description:
Used in internal and external solutions for maintaining pH balance.

More specifically, anions have crucial roles within many biological processes, 
such as maintaining neutrality in charged transport processes,1 maintaining intra and 
extracellular pH,2 and controlling cellular volumes.3 A number of diseases known as 
channelopathies, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and Bartter syndrome, are caused by the 
dysregulation or inhibition of ion transport through membraneembedded ion channels.4,
