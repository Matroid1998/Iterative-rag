Description:
An amino acid residue involved in the construction of the atropTyr C6toTrp N1 linkage.

Text:
The most challenging aspect of the total synthesis of lapparbin (1) 
is the construction of the highly strained atropTyr C6toTrp N1 
linkage, composed of three amino acid residues, inclucing L
tyrosine, Lproline, and Ltryptophan. Recently, we reported the 
total synthesis of cihunamide B, which features a highly strained 
atropTrpTrp linkage.6 In this synthesis, the application of an 
SNAr 
reaction 
followed 
by 
atroposelective 
Larock 
macrocyclization enabled the construction of the highly strained 
atropTrpTrp linkage. Hence, we hypothesized that this 
atroposelective Larock macrocyclization could be applied to the 
total synthesis of lapparbin (1).7 
 Additionally, the efficient introduction of biaryl moieties is a 
critical objective in this study.
