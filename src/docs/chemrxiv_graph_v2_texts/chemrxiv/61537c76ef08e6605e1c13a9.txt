Description:
Ligands that favor high spin states of metal complexes through steric effects.

Text:
For example, Damrauer and Arom have shown that substitution of polypyridine or 
bispyrazolylpyridine ligands close to the metal center favors the highspin states of the 
complexes through an essentially steric effect.1420 In bispyrazolypyridine and other related 
systems, remote substitution by electron withdrawing group was revealed to stabilize the low 
spin states of the complexes, while electron donating groups stabilize the high spin states.16, 2128 
Another key challenge for the implementation of spin crossover materials is the relative fragility 
of the crossover properties and the complexes that display them.8, 29 In that context, 
trispyrazolylborate (Tp) complex of iron(II) are particularly attractive. The archetypal FeTp2
