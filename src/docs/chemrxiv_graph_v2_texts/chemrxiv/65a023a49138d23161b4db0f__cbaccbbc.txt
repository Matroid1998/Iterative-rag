Description:
A petroleum-based precursor used in the production of carbon fibers.

Text:
Carbon fibers have a diameter of approximately 5 to 10 micrometers 1. The worldwide 
demand for carbon fibers has experienced remarkable growth, reaching approximately 150 
thousand metric tonnes in 2021, and is predicted to increase at 7.55 CAGR (Compound 
Annual Growth Rate) until 2035. The high CAGR of carbon fibers occurs because they are 
lightweight, thermally stable, and have high stiffness and high tensile strength. It has been 
used in several industries, such as wind, aerospace, automotive, civil, and pressure vessels 2. Currently, 90 of carbon fibers are based on polyacrylonitrile (PAN), while the remaining 
10 are pitchbased, precisely mesophase pitch. Both precursors are petroleumbased. These 
precursors contribute over 50 of the overall cost of production, making carbon fiber a 
luxury product 3.
