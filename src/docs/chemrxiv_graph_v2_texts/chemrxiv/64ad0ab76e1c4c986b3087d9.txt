Description:
A molecule involved in an exothermic gas-phase reaction with the cyano radical.

Text:
The gasphase reaction between the cyano radical and the ethane molecule presents some 
interesting points for theoretical study i) It is an exothermic reaction, with a low barrier 
height (even barrierless), which appears early on the reaction path, i.e., close to the 
reactants; ii) It presents a heavylightheavy mass combination (HLH) with a linear 
transition state, and a small skew angle,  15.2,  being the angle between the entrance 
and exit channels in massweighted coordinates.
