Description:
Forms desired products in CO2 reduction processes.

thetic catalysts also commonly suffer from sidereactions (in particular hydrogen evolution) that 
are only marginally affected by CO2 concentration, thereby decreasing the proportion of energy 
going towards forming the desired carbon products (i.e., the faradaic efficiency, FE) when utiliz
ing CO2 from low concentration sources.2 
While there have been some reports of direct CO2 reduction at concentrations down to 
1, the low affinity of these systems limit their applicability for atmospheric CO2 and are often 
accompanied by the production of significant side products.2,3 The limitations of current CO2R 
systems therefore require emerging carbon capture technologies47 to produce concentrated 
CO2 gas streams in order to achieve acceptable performances.
