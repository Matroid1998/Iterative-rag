Description:
Forms paddle wheel nodes in the Ni2(ndc)2(dabco) framework.

Text:
A thoroughly investigated representative of
breathing exible MetalOrganic Frameworks
(MOFs),16 sometimes also referred to as third
generation MOFs,79 is the layered pillar MOF
Ni2(ndc)2(dabco)
(ndc

2,6naphthalene
dicarboxylate, dabco  1,4diazabicyclo2.2.2
octane), also known as DUT8(Ni).1027 It con
sists of layers of Ni2(COO)4 paddle wheel nodes
interconnected by ndc linkers (Figure 1). The
so formed layers are interconnected in the third
dimension by dabco pillars (right side of Fig
ure 1). The exible form of DUT8(Ni)23 can be
switched between two distinct phases An open
pore (op) and a closed pore (cp) phase. The
phase transition is triggered by ad and desorp
tion of guest molecules.
