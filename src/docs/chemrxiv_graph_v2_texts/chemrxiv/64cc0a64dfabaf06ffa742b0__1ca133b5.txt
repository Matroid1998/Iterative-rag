Description:
Glycosidic bonds in purines involve the N9 position.

Text:
This unique property of LNAs affects neighboring residues in RNA and DNA to favor C3endo 
conformations, thereby inducing global structural changes in the duplex. (4548) The rigidification of the sugar 
pucker, and, therefore, the structure is one of the reasons why LNA residues enhance duplex stabilities. The 
investigation and extraction of such unique properties of modified RNA residues are, thus, critical as they hold 
the potential to offer novel applications in oligonucleotidebased therapeutics for human diseases. Even though glycosidic bonds in purines involve N9 position, the formation of N7ribofuranosyladenine (7A), 
which is a kinetically favorable ribosylation product during chemical synthesis of adenosine, has been known for 
years (Figure 1AB). Many efforts have been dedicated to N9regioisomers of adenosine while 7A has been totally 
neglected and considered as sideproduct.
