Description:
An environmental carcinogen associated with significant alterations in hematological and biochemical parameters, increasing the risk of blood, hepatic, or renal disorders.

Text:
Cancer is a major cause of death globally and a leading cause of premature death in 
112 out of 183 countries1. About onefifth of people worldwide and onethird of people in developed 
will have cancer during their lifetimes as a result of exposure to environmental carcinogens 2. Environmental carcinogens or exogenous carcinogens includes chemical, biological, and physical agents 
that have the potential to increase cancer risk because of prolonged high prevalence of exposure. Exposure can be through the respiratory, digestive, cutaneous or other possible contamination routes2,3. For example, there is an indication that occupational exposure to benzene causes significant alterations 
in hematological and biochemical parameters and workers are at high risk of developing blood, hepatic 
or renal related disorders4,5.
