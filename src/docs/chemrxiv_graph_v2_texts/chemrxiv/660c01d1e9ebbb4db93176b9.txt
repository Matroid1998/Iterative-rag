Description:
A petrochemical-derived compound used in the synthesis of ion exchange resins.

The global market size of ion exchange resins for water treatment is estimated to be 
USD5.85 billionyr by 2028.1 Many ion exchange resins used for water treatment are 
petroleumbased, often synthesized from styrene and divinylbenzene derived from 
petrochemicals.2 These resins are polymeric structures that can be functionalized to carry 
specific ions, enabling ion exchange.3 After their effective lifetime, spent ion exchange resins 
undergo degradation and gradually lose their efficacy. In addition to the disadvantage of being 
generated from petrochemicals, these spent resins decompose, leading to the formation of 
microplastics and posing further challenges to the environment.
