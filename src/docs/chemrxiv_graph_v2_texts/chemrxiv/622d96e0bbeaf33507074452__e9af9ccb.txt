Thermal expansion studies of mesoporous MOFs
are therefore not only fundamentally interesting, but may
also be useful for applied research. In this manuscript, we use variabletemperature pow
der Xray diraction (XRD) to study the thermal
expansion of PCN22221 (also known as MOF54522
and MMPF623) as a function of varying amounts of
guest content. PCN222 is composed of Zr6(OH)4O4
clusters and tetrakis(4carboxyphenyl)porphyrin linkers
Fig. 1.21 It adopts a Kagomelike structure (csq topol
ogy) with the hexagonal space group P6mmm. Three
types of pores are present mesoporous hexagonal chan
nels, triangular microporous channels, and small inter
cluster pockets along the c direction connecting adja
cent mesopores Fig. 1.
