Description:
Involved in the formation of atmospheric molecular clusters.

Text:
To this
date, no single technique is able to capture the entire route from single molecules to clusters,
ending up as aerosol particles. However, advanced mass spectrometer techniques, such as
the CIAPiTOF,7 have been used to give insight into the chemical composition during
clustering. The properties of clusters within the clustertoparticle transition regime are not well
understood. In the context of new particle formation, the formation of atmospheric molec
ular clusters has been extensively studied using quantum chemical methods. In general, it
has been found that sulfuric acid (SA) and bases, such as ammonia (AM)810 and alky
