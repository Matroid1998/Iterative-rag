Description:
A cathode material commonly used in modern Li-ion batteries.

Over the past two decades, several insertionbased 
cathode materials such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4 have been developed, and are commonly 
used in modern Liion batteries.4,5 However, in order to meet the energy requirements for allelectric 
vehicles (EVs) and grid energy storage, there is an urgent need to develop alternative cathode materials 
which can offer a significant increase in energy density and capacity, while also reducing costs and 
environmental detrimental footprints of current cathode materials.4,6 
Sulfur, which is the 5th most abundant element on Earth, has gained special attention as a promising 
cathode material owing to its theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mA h g1, which is the highest among 
solid elements, and around tenfold the capacity traditional cathodes offer.79 In addition to the high 
specific capacity of sulfur, transitioning from traditional insertion cathodes to sulfurbased counterparts 
offers several additional benefits, namely, low operating voltage of 2.15 V vs LiLi, which enhances 
overall safety of the cell, along with a great difference in price and environmental impact between sulfur 
and costly toxic transition metals such as cobalt, nickel and manganese.8,10,11 The aforementioned 
increase in capacity over conventional insertion compound cathodes can enable the assembly of 
LithiumSulfur batteries (LSBs) with a high energy density of 400600 Wh kg1, which is two to three 
times greater than that of current Liion batteries, and can potentially achieve the coveted target range 
of 500 km between charges for EVs.12,13 The low cost and high energy density also make sulfur cathodes 
appealing for grid energy storage for renewable energies such as solar and wind, provided that high 
system efficiency and long cycle life can be achieved.
