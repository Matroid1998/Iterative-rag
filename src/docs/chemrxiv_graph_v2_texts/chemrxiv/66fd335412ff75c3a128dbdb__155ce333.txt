Description:
Part of a triple catalytic system used for the oxidation of alcohols.

Text:
Bckvall and coworkers had established the use of a 
triple 
catalytic 
system 
consisting 
of 
RuCI 
(OAc)(PPh3)3hydroquinone
Co(salophen)(PPh3), for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, geraniol, cinnamyl alcohol, 
and 2naphthylmethanol by multistep electron transfer at 20 C under 1 atm of O2. 27 
The Marko group has also made a great contribution to develop efficient selective 
oxidation of alcohols using O2. They have developed homogenous Coppercatalyzed,
