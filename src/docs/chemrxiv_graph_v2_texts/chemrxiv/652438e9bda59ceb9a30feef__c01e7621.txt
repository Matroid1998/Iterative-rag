Description:
A ubiquitous and important class of ligands in organometallic chemistry affecting coordination, thermodynamic stability, and reactivity of transition metal complexes.

Text:
Phosphines represent a ubiquitous and extremely important class of ligands in organometallic 
chemistry, and their donor properties greatly affect the coordination, thermodynamic stability, and 
reactivity of transition metal complexes. Phosphines have been shown to significantly modulate the 
reactivity of many organometallic catalyzed reactions, such as hydroformylation,13 crosscoupling,49 and 
hydrogenation.10, 11 To develop new organometallic catalytic reactions where stability and reactivity is 
modulated by phosphines it would be desirable to have extremely fast methods to calculate and explore 
phosphine properties. In this general effort, Gensch, Sigman, and AspuruGuzik recently reported the 
Kraken database that consists of over 300,000 mostly hypothetical phosphine ligands created based on a 
combination of experimentally known phosphines.12 Along with structures, Kraken contains several 
calculated steric and electronic descriptors.

Description:
Ligands whose donor capacity is compared using the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP).

Text:
Fey has demonstrated and popularized the utility of ligand 
descriptors and properties to evaluate possible catalytic activity.1321 
One major chemical descriptor that has been used for several decades to compare the donor 
capacity of phosphines is the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP). The TEP is a very sensitive measure of 
a ligands electron donating or electron withdrawing capacity with only minor influence from steric and 
dispersion type effects.2224 Typically, a Tolman electronic parameter is measured by the A1 symmetric 
carbonyl stretching frequency for an LNi0(CO)3 complex, where L is the ligand of interest. Figure 1 
displays a 3dimensional representation of (CH3)3PNi0(CO)3 with a depiction of the A1 symmetric carbonyl 
stretch.
