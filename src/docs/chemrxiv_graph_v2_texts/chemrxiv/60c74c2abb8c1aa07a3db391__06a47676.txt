Description:
Used as anodic material in high-performance lithium ion batteries.

Text:
Stateoftheart lithium ion batteries (LIBs) dominate the energy storage
market due to their high energy density and long cycle life compared to other
energy storage systems1. However, commercial LIBs often use liquid
electrolytes (such LiPF6 in ECDEC organic solvent), which have a variety of
safety, thermal and toxicity concerns, some of which are uniquely problematic
in the emerging electric vehicle market2, 3. It is thought these concerns can be
addressed by use of an allsolidstate battery (ASSB), where the flammable
electrolyte is replaced with an inorganic solidstate electrolyte (SSE). Additionally, ASSBs would also allow higher energy density cells by enabling
use of highperformance cathode materials and anodic lithium metal. Therefore SSEs have attracted considerable attention in the field of next
generation LIBs4, 5.

Description:
A component of lithium garnet systems known for good electrochemical stability and high room temperature Li ion conductivity.

Text:
Over the last few decades, various potential SSEs have
been investigated, including LISICON68, NASICON9, 10, perovskites11, garnet12,
ThioLISICON13, argyrodite14 and antiperovskites15. However, of all the
systems reported, the lithium garnet systems are among the few which
encompass both good electrochemical stability and high room temperature Li
ion conductivity. Hence the garnet solidstate electrolytes are envisaged as
promising candidates for allsolidstate batteries. The ideal garnet has a general formula A3B2C3O12 where A, B and C are 8, 6
and 4 oxygen coordinated metal ions. The garnet has a cubic structure (Ia

3d), which contains a framework of cornerlinked tetrahedra and octahedra
