Description:
Proposed to mimic piperidine in bioactive compounds.

Text:
. Piperidine is a popular molecule. Its ring is 
among the top3 most frequently used in medicinal chemistry1 
and is found in the structure of 100 drugs. 2 
In 2010, 2azaspiro3.3heptane was proposed to mimic 
piperidine in bioactive compounds (Figure 1a). 3 This concept 
became common, 4 and analogous mimetics for 2, 3 and 4
substituted piperidines have been subsequently developed.5,6,7 
During the past decade, 2azaspiro3.3heptanes appeared in at 
least 100 research manuscripts, 500 patents, and 7.000 newly 
reported compounds (Figure 1a). 8 Moreover, the numbers 
continue to grow (Figure 2). In this work, we synthesed, characterized, and validated 
biologically in vivo 1azaspiro3.3heptane. Our work enables the 
use of this molecular scaffold as a new generation of piperidine 
bioisosteres (Figure 1b). Figure 1.
