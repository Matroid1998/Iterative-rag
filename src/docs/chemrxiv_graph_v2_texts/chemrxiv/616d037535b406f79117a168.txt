Description:
Primarily unreacted elemental sulfur dissolved or plasticised in a solution of low molecular weight polysulfides.

Text:
The reaction between sulfur and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) has been 
investigated for nearly half a century, providing a processible form of 
sulfur useful in the construction and composites industries.15 In 
these applications, the sulfur is primarily unreacted elemental sulfur 
dissolved or plasticised in a solution of low molecular weight 
polysulfides derived from a relatively low feed ratio of DCPD 
(typically 25 or less by mass).15 These mixtures can be processed 
as liquids at elevated temperatures (130140 C) and used as mortar 
for concrete buildings,2 sealants for tailings ponds,2 or reinforcement 
for plastic and glass fibres.3 Recently, we revisited copolymerisations 
of sulfur and DCPD,6 establishing how the feed ratio can be used to 
tune the thermal and mechanical properties of these polymers.6, 7 In 
these prior studies, sulfur was fully incorporated into the final, cured 
polymer, distinguishing these materials from the earlier sulfur 
plasticisation studies.

Description:
Reacts with norbornene alkene of DCPD to form linear, solution processible oligomers.

Text:
Fully crosslinked copolymers made from sulfur and DCPD have 
useful properties such as high hardness and modulus, and solvent 
resistance.6, 7 These properties would be advantageous for coating 
applications, but the insolubility of these crosslinked polymers makes 
processing difficult. Here, we present a robust process for 
overcoming the intractability of the target copolymer. First, sulfur is reacted with the more reactive norbornene alkene8 
of DCPD to provide linear, solution processible oligomers (1). The 
oligomers are shelf stable and can be easily coated onto diverse 
substrates. Upon curing, in situ SS metathesis as well as addition to 
the cyclopentenyl alkene provides the crosslinked polymer coating.
