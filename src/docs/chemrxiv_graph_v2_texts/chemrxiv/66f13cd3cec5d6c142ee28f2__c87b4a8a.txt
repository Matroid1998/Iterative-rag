Description:
A gas incorporated into MOFs for exploration of gas storage properties.

Text:
As a proofofconcept investigation, we 
recently reported on xenon storage in a MOF known as MFU4,8 
demonstrating the feasibility of storing significant quantities of 
gas (larger than 40 wt) within the voids, even when the material 
was exposed to air under ambient conditions.9 In followup 
studies we investigated the approach on an example of sulfur 
hexafluoride as a guest trapped in the pores of MOFs MFU410 
and ZIF8.11 Herein, considering the practically boundless MOF 
design possibilities,12 we delve into an exploration of the gas 
storage properties of the MOF MFU4 by tailoring its structural 
characteristics and incorporating diverse gas guests, namely 
krypton and xenon, and examine such systems comprehensively 
through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods.
