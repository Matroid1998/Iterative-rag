Description:
Present in feed during hydrogenation under frontend conditions.

Text:
Due to the lower risk of reactor 
50 
runaway, hydrogenation under tailend conditions is most widely used in industry and well 
51 
researched.7,1012 The hydrogenation under frontend conditions takes place in front of the 
52 
demethanizer8 and therefore, the feed contains high hydrogen concentration as well as carbon 
53 
monoxide and methane.3,4,6,10,12,13 This carries the risk of overhydrogenation and hot spot 
54 
formation.4 The key advantage of frontend conditions is the improved process integration
