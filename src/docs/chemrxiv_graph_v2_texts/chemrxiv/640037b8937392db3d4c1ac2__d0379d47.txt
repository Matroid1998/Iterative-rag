Description:
Used in nanodroplet experiments to study the absence of hydrogen bonds in certain complexes.

This offers a playground for dynamical and
kinetic studies.3,4
Neutral radical complexes which share a hydrogen atom be
tween two acceptors are less studied, with the exception of the
paradigmatic H3 system which is only (meta)stable in electron
ically excited states.5 The neutral FHF complex has remained
elusive,6 whereas in the ClHCl case, helium nanodroplet experi
ments have shown the absence of a hydrogen bond.7 For BrHBr,
isotope substitution controls the preferred structure in a particu
larly interesting way.8 It again appears desirable to extend the
study of such neutral XHX species to organic radicals X, where
conformational isomerism is expected to influence the energetics
and dynamics of the shared hydrogen atom.9
A natural choice for X is the persistent, sterically hindered
Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Goettingen, Tammannstr.
