Description:
Precipitated from acidic solutions through hydrolysis of salts.

Text:
The hydrothermal precipitation of iron from acidic solutions is well known 
and is due to the hydrolysis of salts, in particular, for nitrate salts (Shang and 
Weert, 1993) with the formation of hematite at temperatures above 140 C.
