Description:
Sequestered in biochar, a graphitic solid used to enhance agricultural soil properties.

These systems leverage the caloric value of feces (upwards of 25.7 MJkg1 dry 
basis) to reduce fecal sludge volume, destroy pathogenic organisms, and remove many harmful 
chemical compounds.13,14 The relatively high treatment temperature of pyrolysis (e.g., 350  
800C) transforms feedstock (e.g., fecal sludge) into biochar, a graphitic solid that can be used to 
enhance agriculture soil properties and qualifies for carbon sequestration credits.15,16 Additionally, 
the produced thermal energy can be converted to electrical energy or leveraged to dry influent 
fecal sludge.17,18 While the moisture content of fecal sludge may be considered an obstacle to 
thermal treatment, dewatering followed by drying with the produced thermal energy can achieve 
the minimum requirements in many cases.13,19 
The development of thermal treatment systems has been accelerated through the Bill  
Melinda Gates Foundations Reinvent the Toilet initiative.20,21 Communityscale, nonsewered 
sanitation systems developed through this program have been coined Omni Processors 
(OPs).20,21 From a technological standpoint, these communityscale fecal sludge management 
systems are marketed as optimized sludge treatment technologies leveraging thermal treatment
