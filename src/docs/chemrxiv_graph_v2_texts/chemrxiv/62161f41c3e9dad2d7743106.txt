The emergence and spread of drug resistance in the malaria parasite
is a severe public health concern all over the malariaendemic countries.13 Artemisinin re
sistance is dened as delayed parasite clearance following treatment with artemisinin mono
therapy or with artemisininbased combination therapy.46 Early signs of delayed response
to artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum parasite were rst reported in 2009 in northwest
Cambodia.7,8 This phenotype has been now reported in Thailand,8,9 Vietnam,10,11 Myan
mar,8,12 and China.13 Resistance to artemisinin has also been reported in India,14,15 and is
highly suspected in South America16 and East Africa.17,18
Single site mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 protein (PfK13) were as
sociated with the artemisinin resistance.1921 Till now, 124 dierent nonsynonymous kelch
mutations have been identied which are associated with the artemisinin resistance.2224 The
frequent and most prevalent mutations detected in resistant populations are Y493H (tyro
sine(Y) 493 is replaced by histidine(H)), R539T (arginine(R) 539 is replaced by threo
nine(T)), I543T (isoleucine(I) 543 is replaced by threonine(T)) and C580Y (cysteine(C)
580 is replaced by tyrosine(Y)) respectively.2426 The C580Y mutation occurs in about
55 of samples with any resistance mutation in Southeast Asia and is assumed to be one
of the strong molecular markers for artemisinin resistance.25 The next most prevalent mu
tation is Y493H, which occurs in about 10 of samples with any resistance mutation in
SoutheastAsia.27
The PfK13 protein contains 726 aminoacid residues consisting of nonconserved apicomplexa
specic Nterminal region (aminoacids 1211), highly conserved coiledcoilcontaining do
main (aminoacids 212341), wellconserved BTBdomain (aminoacids 350442) and C
terminal Kelchdomain (aminoacids 443726) as shown in Fig.1b.
