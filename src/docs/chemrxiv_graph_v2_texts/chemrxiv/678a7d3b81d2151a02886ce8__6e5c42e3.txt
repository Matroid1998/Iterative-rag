Description:
A main group element featured in fewer examples of fluorescent metal sensors.

Various analytical methods can be employed 
to sense such ions, such as mass spectrometry,5 
atomic absorption spectroscopy,6 or electrochemical 
techniques.7 However, sensing materials based on 
fluorescence remain particularly popular owing to 
their high sensitivity, relatively lower cost, and rapid 
analysis.8 This has allowed for the development of a 
variety of molecular systems able to sense metal ions 
in solution with fluorescence spectroscopy, via either 
a turnoff or turnon response.9 
While numerous systems have been developed as 
fluorescent metal sensors, there are far fewer 
examples of fluorescent metal sensors that feature 
maingroup elements, such as phosphorus.
