Description:
Acts as an electron-deficient electrophile in conjugate addition reactions.

Organocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and powerful tool for performing organic 
reactions 1 and polymerizations 2 in recent years. In this context phosphines have 
proven to be potent Lewisbase catalysts 3,4 for a variety of reactions 5, including 
but not limited to RauhutCurrier 6, MoritaBaylis Hillman 7 and Michael reactions 
8,9,10. In all the mentioned reactions, the first step of the catalytic cycle is the 
nucleophilic attack of the phosphine on the electrophile, in many cases an electron 
deficient olefin. The zwitterion formed from this conjugate addition can subsequently 
act as a nucleophile or as a base 35. The efficiency of this zwitterion formation is of 
great importance since it is the initiation step for the catalytic cycle in Michael reactions 
8.
