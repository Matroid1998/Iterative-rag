Description:
A molecular motif used to implement steric hindrance and structural rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules.

From a thermodynamic perspective, the reactivity trend operating in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) 
reactions mediated by radical and radicallike reagents such as metaloxo species is greatly influenced by 
the CH bond dissociation energies (BDEs) that typically follow the order tertiary  secondary  primary 
(Scheme 1A)14. In contrast, in precious metals mediated C(sp3)H bond functionalization proceeding 
through the formation of an organometallic intermediate, an opposite reactivity trend is observed, dictated 
by the strength of the resultant MC bond (Scheme 1B)1518. The tertbutyl group is a common molecular motif used to implement steric hindrance and structural rigidity 
in organic and organometallic molecules19. However, in terms of reactivity, the tertbutyl CH bonds 
represent a special case.
