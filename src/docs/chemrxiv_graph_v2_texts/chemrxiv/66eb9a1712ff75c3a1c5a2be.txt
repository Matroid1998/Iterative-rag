Description:
A solvent used in the frozen solution for spectrum analysis at 170 K.

At 
170 K, the spectrum of cg2 in the frozen toluened8 solution shows resonance signals composed of 
two components zerofield splitting (ZFS) from a triplet (S  1) component and central peaks from a 
doublet (S  12) component, which can be readily separated by simulation (Fig. 4c, simulation 
parameters are attached in the Supplementary Information). A forbidden transition (s  2 ) 
signal is also observed (ms refers to magnetic quantum number). The characteristic ZFS and halffield 
absorption provide solid evidence49 for the existence of triplet state in Clars goblet and rule out the 
possibility that the two spins are weakly interacted. Furthermore, ZFS parameters of   114.5 
MHz and   15.7 MHz are obtained from simulations. Using the equation D  1.39
