Description:
Protective ligands for nanoclusters, contributing to unique geometric and electronic structures.

Text:
reported that a catalyst comprising Au24Pt 
nanoclusters (NCs) protected by 1hexanethiolates (C6), 
Au24Pt(C6)180 (Figure S1a), exhibits twice the activity of a 
model Pt catalyst comprising 20 wt Pt on Vulcan carbon black 
(CB).6 Unlike NPs, atomically precise noble metal NCs7 pro
tected by thiolates (SR; Mm(SR)n, where m  the number of 
metal atoms and n  the number of thiolates) tend to have 
unique but uniform geometric and electronic structures.814 
Consequently, 
the 
characteristics 
of 
SRprotected 
monodisperse NCs are readily correlated with their geometric 
structures.1524 As an example, Our group previously studied the 
electrocatalytic properties of Au25(PET)180 (PET  2phe
nylethanethiolate; Figure S1b), Au38(PET)240, Au130(PET)500, 
Au144(PET)600, Au329(PET)840, Au25(C6)180, Au25(C12)180 
(C12  1dodecanethiolate; Figure S1c), Au20.5Ag4.5(PET)180, 
Au23.7Cu1.3(PET)180, Au24Pd(PET)180, and Au25(PET)18 
NCs and revealed the relationships between chemical composi
tion and HER activity.25 In addition, owing to the high HER 
activity of Au24Pt(C6)180, we recently produced new AuPt al
loy NCs from Au24Pt(PET)180 (1; Table 1) using a ligand ex
change method.
