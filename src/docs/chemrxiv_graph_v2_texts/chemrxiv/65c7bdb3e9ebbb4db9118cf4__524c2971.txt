Description:
Forms cohesive and stable phases with qtz topology.

Text:
It is shown that BX phases (X  As, Sb, Bi) with qtz 
topology are cohesive and stable both mechanically (elastic constants and their combinations) and 
dynamically (phonon band structures). It should be noted, however, that there is a small dynamical 
instability of qtz BX in the case of the heaviest pnictogen, bismuth. The respective equations of
