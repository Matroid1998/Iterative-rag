Description:
Used in microfluidic devices to filter and separate particles of different sizes.

Their detection is essential for human health, for example, detecting parasite eggs of 
Schistosoma haematobium in urine,4,5 or for environmental screening, for example, the 
detection and identification of zooplankton.6 As a result of their low concentration, the 
sample must be preconcentrated using rounds of centrifugation, filters, or decanting the 
liquid for days.7 This is simply timeconsuming and impractical during infield analyses. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices have been used to filter and separate 
particles of different sizes, especially cells, from various mixtures.812 These microfluidic 
devices rely on fine lateral (XY) resolution for trapping microparticles. For example, a set of 
pillars with an inter distance of 25 m will collect particles bigger than 25 m while smaller 
particles will pass through.
