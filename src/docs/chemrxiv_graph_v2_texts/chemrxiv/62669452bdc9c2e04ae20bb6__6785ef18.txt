The use of polyphosphate and orthophosphatepolyphosphate blends for corrosion 
74 
control in drinking water distribution systems is controversial. While polyphosphate is 
75 
effective for controlling aesthetic water quality issues (i.e. discoloration, calcium scaling) 
76 
1,2, it increases lead release through aqueous complexation or colloidal dispersion 35, 
77 
and leadpolyphosphate complexes have been observed in tap water 6. A limited 
78 
understanding of orthophosphatepolyphosphatelead interactions leaves utilities that 
79 
use these additives vulnerable to lead contamination at consumers taps. 80 
Individual polyphosphates may differ widely in their effects on water quality structural 
81 
differences strongly determine polyphosphate interactions with metal ions. Linear 
82 
polyphosphates (e.g. tripolyphosphate) are more effective sequestrants than 
83 
cyclophosphates (e.g. trimetaphosphate, hexametaphosphate) 7,8.
