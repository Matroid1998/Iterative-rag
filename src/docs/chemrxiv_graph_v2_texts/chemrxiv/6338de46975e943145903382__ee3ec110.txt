Description:
Singlephase materials capable of multispecies transport, such as H!, O, and e, h.

There has been enormous research in ionic conducting materials that enable 
electrochemical devices. The vast majority of research has focused on singlephase materials 
capable of conducting a single ionic species 19. Some singlephase materials, such as rareearth 
oxide doped perovskites, are capable of multispecies transport (e.g., H!, O, and e, h) 
1012. However, it is not thermodynamically possible to tune the total conductivity of the single
phase with simultaneous transport of multiple charged species 13. Recently, the third class of 
ionic conductors has emerged where a composite consisting of multiple phases is able to 
accomplish uncoupled simultaneous transport of multiple ionic species.
