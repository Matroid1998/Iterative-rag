Description:
Used as the active material in the cathode composite of all-solid-state batteries.

Solidstate electrolytes for allsolidstate batteries (ASSBs) are intensively researched in recent 
years, due to the improved safety they offer compared to liquid electrolytes and because they 
may enable alternative electrodes1. In 2018, Asano et al.2 reported that the ternary halides 
Li3YCl6 and Li3YBr6 have ionic conductivities of 1 103 Scm and showcased ASSBs with 
coulombic efficiencies of 94 using (uncoated) LiCoO2 as the active material in the cathode 
composite. Since then, the material family Li3M(III)X6 (M(III) Y, In, Sc, Lanthanides; XCl, 
Br, I)) and other halide solid electrolytes have gained renewed interest in the scientific 
community due to their favorable combination of ionic conductivity (mScm) and 
highvoltage cathode compatibility. More recently, Zhou et al.3 reached a milestone in the 
development of ASSBs using a Li2InxSc0.66xCl4 electrolyte.
