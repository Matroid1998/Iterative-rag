Description:
Reagents used in Suzuki coupling to synthesize carbon-carbon bonds.

Text:
A reaction of critical
importance in this domain is the Suzuki coupling because
of its ability to synthesize carboncarbon bonds via the cou
pling of organohalides with boronic acids.1, 2 The perfor
mance and specicity of this reaction are largely inuenced
by the ligand selection in palladium (Pd)based catalytic
systems.3
The traditional approaches to ligand discovery have been
characterized by intensive experimental screening processes
that are both timeintensive and demand signicant re
sources.46 Computational methodologies for identifying
ecient catalysts have evolved, predominantly involving
the screening of extensive enumerated libraries, typically
ranging from 1035 catalysts.7 These virtual screenings
are executed through (semiempirical) quantum mechan
ics (QM) calculations which limits the size of the screen
library due to the computational cost.8, 9 In response to
this challenge, researchers have turned to machine learning
(ML) models, trained on preexisting data, to screen more
extensive libraries, which may include up to 106 catalysts or
more.1012 While ML models have proven valuable within
their trained domains, their ecacy often diminishes when
applied to scenarios outside their original scope, particu
larly in the context of true de novo generation.
