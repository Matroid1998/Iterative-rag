Subject to gas-phase decomposition studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular beam mass spectrometry.

Text:
TiN is a commonly 
employed diffusion barrier material10 known for its hardness, refractory properties, and boasts a 
bulk resistivity of 20 cm.3 The decomposition and reaction mechanisms of TDMAT have been 
extensively studied.1114 Another study on gas phase decomposition and reactions of different 
tris(dimethylamido) precursors, utilizing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular 
beam mass spectrometry found that gasphase decomposition of tris(dimethylamido)stibine
