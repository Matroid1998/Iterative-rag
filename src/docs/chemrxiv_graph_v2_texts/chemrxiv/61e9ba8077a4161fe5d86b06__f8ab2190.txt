Description:
Known for its high catalytic activity.

Text:
Within catalysis, this has
been demonstrated for HEAs, where the large number of
dierent atomic environments results in a distribution of
binding energies of the catalytic intermediates, with some
sites thereby reaching the maximum activity according to
the Sabatier principle.20 The catalytic properties of HEOs
are less studied,21 and the transferability of this principle
is therefore yet to be explored. Here we outline a strategy for the theoretical investiga
tion of HEOs as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Inspired by the high catalytic activity of IrO2 and RuO2,
the (110) surface of a rutile oxide based on Ir, Ru, Ti, Os
and Rh is chosen as example.
