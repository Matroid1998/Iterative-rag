Description:
Contains an amide carbonyl group.

These mutual interactions often require a compro
mise between solventsolvent interactions and specific solventso
lute interactions such as those arising from charged or dipolar func
tional groups as well as steric effects.1921 Additionally, in some 
cases there can be a significant interplay between the solvent field 
and the electronic structure of the solute, such as in donoracceptor 
polyenes where changes in solvent polarity lead to drastic changes 
in the bondalternation pattern of the polyene.2224 Theoretical 
models that aim to mechanistically understand and predict how so
lutes direct solvent organization to produce spectroscopic fre
quency shifts originate with the reaction field model of Onsager,25 
and have since been extended to more detailed selfconsistent re
action fields,2627 and more recent implicit solvent models.2832 
 Here we elucidate how the molecular properties of solutes alter 
the electric fields they experience by investigating and contrasting 
molecules containing amide (amides and dimethylurea) and non
amide (ester, thioester, and ketone) carbonyls (Figure 1A) in a 
range of polar solvents.
