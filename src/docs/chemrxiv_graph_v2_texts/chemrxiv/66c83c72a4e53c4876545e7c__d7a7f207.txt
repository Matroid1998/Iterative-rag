Description:
A gas that can be absorbed by metalorganic frameworks due to their large adsorption capacity.

Text:
Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of CO2 absorbents owing to
their large capacity for the adsorption of gases and their structural and chemical tun
ability.1 Over 90,000 MOFs have been synthesized,2 and over a trillion structures have
been predicted in silico.3 High throughput computational screening studies have been
conducted to find the optimal MOF for a given application.4 Such screening studies use
molecular simulation to predict the adsorption properties. These simulations rely on
generic force fields, such as the universal force field (UFF)5 or Dreiding,6 to describe
the interactions between the adsorbed gas molecules and the atoms of the MOFs.3,7,8
The generic force fields use one set of LennardJones parameters for each element.
