Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked excitement across many scientific disciplines. Part
of this excitement is due to the potential to revolutionize the fields of medicine and laboratory sciences. Ma
chine learning (ML), a subset of AI where computers are capable of adapting without explicit programming
based on algorithms and statistical models, is particularly suitable for nanoparticle production and formulation
development 15. Indeed, in preliminary examples, ML has been used to engineer multifunctional peptides
to boost the melanin binding rates in ocular delivery 6, optimize the uptake of poly(lacticcoglycolic acid)
polyethylene glycol (PLGAPEG) nanoparticles in breast cancer cells 7, and predict the transfection efficiency
of lipid nanoparticles deploying nucleic acids 8.
