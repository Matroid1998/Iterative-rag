Description:
Investigated as a cation shuttle for alternative battery systems to lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Lithiumion batteries (LIBs) have become the dominant power source for portable electronics 
and automotive applications.1 The depletion of lithium resources worldwide necessitates the 
exploration of alternative electroactive species that can be extracted from cheap and abundant 
raw materials to establish a sustainable and economically viable new chain in energy storage. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in postLi batteries based on Na, K, Ca2, and 
Zn2 cation shuttles as viable alternatives to LIBs.2,3 However, developing alternative battery 
systems with long cycle life and low cost, without sacrificing energy density, remains a 
challenge.
