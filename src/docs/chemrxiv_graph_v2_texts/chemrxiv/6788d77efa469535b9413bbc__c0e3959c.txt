Description:
A compound that forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds through methylation of specific backbone amides, reducing polar surface area for membrane transition.

Text:
A wellstudied example of the first method is Cyclosporin A and it was 
found that by methylation of specific backbone amides, intramolecular hydrogen bonds 
(IMHBs) are induced, forcing hydrophobic amino acid side chains to the periphery. 1013 In this 
conformation, the polar backbone amides are shielded effectively reducing the polar surface 
area (PSA) of the macrocycle during the transition through the hydrophobic parts of the cellular 
membrane.
