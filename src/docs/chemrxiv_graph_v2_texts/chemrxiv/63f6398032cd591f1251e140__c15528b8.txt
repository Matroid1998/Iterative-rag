Description:
Intermediates whose lifetime is limited during copolymerisation to enable high sequence selectivity.

Text:
of sulfur centres 
into the parent polycarbonates results in a net shift of the polymerisation equilibrium towards, and therefore 
facilitating, depolymerisation. During copolymerisation however the catalyst enables near quantitative 
generation of the metastable polymers in high sequence selectivity by limiting the lifetime of alkoxide 
intermediates. Furthermore, linkage selectivity is key to obtain semicrystalline materials that can be moulded 
into selfstanding objects.
