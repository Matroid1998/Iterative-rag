Description:
A top-ranked compound identified in a high throughput screen for selectively killing ICC cell lines with IDH1 mutations.

Text:
To find synthetic 
lethal sensitivities present in cells harboring IDH12 mutations, we executed a systematic high
throughput screen of approved and experimental therapeutics libraries to identify compounds that 
selectively kill ICC cell lines harboring IDH1 mutations.2 To that end, a collection of 7,988 
compounds with annotated mechanisms of action andor pharmacological targets was screened in 
8point dose response against the RBE and SNU1079 biliary tract cancer cell lines that contain 
the common R132H and R132C IDH1 mutations, respectively. Counterscreening against biliary 
tract cell lines CCLP1 and HUCCT1 containing wild type (wt) IDH1 was done to deprioritize 
cytotoxic compounds towards cells with wt IDH1. A topranked compound that emerged from 
these screening efforts was 3(5hydroxymethyl2furyl)1benzyl indazole (YC1; lificiguat),
