Description:
Studied for antimicrobial and antitumor properties.

Text:
2,4,6Trimethoxyphenyl ethyl PCA is 
involved in synthesis, characterization and heterogeneous base catalysis of amino 
functionalized lanthanide metalorganic frameworks 12; in efficient MgBr2.OEt2  
catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation 13; in coating composition comprising UV
absorbent and mixed solvent for release film 14. 2,4,6Trimethoxy ringsubstituted 1
methylethyl PCA was mentioned in biochemical evaluation of virtual screening methods 
reveals a cellactive inhibitor of the cancerpromoting phosphatases of regenerating liver 
15. 3,4,5Trimethoxyphenyl ethyl PCA is reported in synthesis, antimicrobial and 
antitumor study of new pyrido2,1aisoquinolines via isoquinoline1acetonitrile 16; in a 
functionalized UiO66 MOF for turnon fluorescence sensing of superoxide in water and
