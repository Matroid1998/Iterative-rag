Description:
A material with weak spin-orbit coupling and long spin relaxation time, used in spintronics applications.

Text:
Utilizing graphene as a spinselective transport material in spintronics applications has raised
broad interest due to its weak spinorbit coupling and long spin relaxation time.14 The
zigzag edged graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are of particular interest in this regard due
to their lowbandgap and magnetic semiconducting nature with antiferromagnetic (AFM)
coupling between the opposite edges.58 GNRs having different widths and edge structures
can be experimentally synthesized using lithography and bottomup chemical synthesis us
ing molecular precursors.911 Ruffieux et al. have demonstrated that precise zigzagedged
GNRs can be synthesized using surfaceassisted polymerization and cyclodehydrogenation
of molecular precursor monomers.12 Wang et al.

Description:
A material whose electronic structure can be affected by molecule adsorption and doping.

Text:
have demonstrated the tunability of the
edge states of the bilayer zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with the twist angle and
stacking offset.13
There are a lot of studies on the effect of molecule adsorption on the electronic structure
of pristine and doped graphene, armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons.14,15 Hou et
al. reported that the edge functionalization of ZGNRs with a radical can result in gapped
ferromagnetic (FM) ZGNRs which can be further controlled by the doping of B or N atoms in
the coupling pathway.1618 The electronic structure of molecules adsorbed systems provides a
good estimate of the induced spin polarization.
