Description:
An elemental powder used in the synthesis of Ag3Au(Se1xTex)2.

Text:
In this study, we explore band gap tuning by chemical
substitution of Se2with larger Te2anions in Ag3AuSe2
to expand the unit cell. We investigated the synthesis
of Ag3Au(Se1xTex)2 with x from 0 to 1 and examined
their electrical and optical properties experimentally. II. METHODS
Ag3Au(Se1xTex)2 alloys with the tellurium fraction
x  0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9, and 1 were syn
thesized from elemental powders of Ag (99.9 metals
basis), Au (99.98 metals basis), Se (99.9999 metals
basis) and Te (99.8 metals basis). Powders were mixed
together in respective stoichiometric ratios and sealed in
evacuated silica ampules. Sealed ampules were annealed
at 800 C for 24 hours, followed by a slow cooling to room
temperature over 24 hours.
