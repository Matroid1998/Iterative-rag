Description:
A component of the HER2 receptor's kinase domain involved in signal transduction.

Text:
HER2 receptors are transmembrane proteins with signal transduction potential due to tyrosine 
kinase activity (1). The structure of HER2 receptors contains a ligandbinding domain 
(extracellular), a single transmembrane helix, a tyrosine kinase domain (intracellular), and a C
terminal tail (intracellular) (1). HER2, unlike other HER family receptors, does not have a known

ligand (2). Instead, it forms heterodimers with different receptors in the HER family (HER1, 
HER3, HER4) that are activated by their ligands (3). HER2 plays a vital part in cell growth, 
differentiation, and survival. Its heterodimer formation enhances these receptor complexes 
signaling potency (4). This activates intracellular pathways such as the MAPK and PI3KAKt 
pathways, helping cell multiplication (5).
