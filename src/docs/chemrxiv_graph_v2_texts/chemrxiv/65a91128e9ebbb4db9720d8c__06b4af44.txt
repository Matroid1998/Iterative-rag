Description:
Materials whose membranes may develop cracks during calcination, affecting separation performance and mechanical properties.

Text:
In the case of zeolite membranes,
calcination may introduce cracks that compromise their separation performance and mechanical
properties.1 Thus, there is a significant interest in developing routes for the removal of organics
from zeolites through milder treatments.2 The effectiveness of such methods depends on the pore
system and on the nature of the OSDA.

coke) from spent zeolite catalysts using O3
dates back to the mid 1980s,8 the low temperature OSDA removal by O3 treatments was first
specifically reported in 1994 when van der Waals et al.
