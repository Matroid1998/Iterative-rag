Description:
Known since 1938 to convert to ketene and phenol under thermolytic conditions.

Text:
8THC, an unregulated isomer of 9THC, along 
with its acetate derivative (8THCOAc, Figure 1), have become increasingly available, particularly in 
states where 9THC is illegal.5 However, there is a lack of published peerreviewed research concerning 
the cannabinoid acetates. The health risks of these compounds are currently unknown, despite their 
potency and ready availability. Each of the cannabinoid acetates possesses a phenyl acetate substructure. Phenyl acetate has been 
known since 1938 to convert to ketene and phenol under thermolytic conditions (Scheme 1).6 Ketene is 
a highly reactive poisonous gas.
