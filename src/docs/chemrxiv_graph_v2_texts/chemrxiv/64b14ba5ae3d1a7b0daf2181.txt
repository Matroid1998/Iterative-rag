Description:
A simplified structural analogue of the right half macrolactone core of halichondrin, used as an anticancer medication.

Text:
The halichondrin family comprises of more than 20 unique marine natural products that are 
characterized by their common macrolactone core and left half polycyclic fused ring system.1 
These compounds all exhibit potent cytotoxicity via microtubule growth inhibition, a mechanism 
that has been harnessed in the development of the commonly prescribed anticancer medication 
eribulin, a simplified structural analogue of the right half macrolactone core.25 Over the past 
decade there has been renewed interest in the preparation and biological evaluation of members of 
the halichondrin family.624 Here, we report the total synthesis of halichondrin B 1020 (1), first 
isolated by Blunt, Munro and coworkers in 2009 from the New Zealand deep water sponge 
Lissodendoryx sp.25 
Halichondrin B 1020 is distinguished from other members of the family by the incorporation of a 
truncated left half butyrolactone at C47C50, a structural feature that confers the left half 
spirocyclic ring system latent C2 symmetry (Scheme 1).
