Description:
A system that forms an ion pair of dopant anion and polymer cation via integer charge transfer.

Thus, a detailed under
standing of evolution of electronic interactions during the doping process is paramount. In ptype doping, the molecular dopant is often chosen such that its lowest unoccu
pied molecular orbital (LUMO) is lower in energy than the highest occupied molecular or
bital (HOMO) of the conjugated polymer. The molecular dopant 2,3,5,6tetrafluoro7,7,8,8
tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) with LUMO at 5.24 eV is popularly used as p
type dopant for the prototypical polymer system, poly(3hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with the
HOMO at 5 eV.6 The molecular structures of the mentioned molecular systems are shown
in Fig. 1(a). Via integer charge transfer, the P3HTF4TCNQ system forms an ionpair (IP)
of dopant anion and polymer cation with accompanying nuclear reorganization around the
charge separated state, i.e. polaron formation.
