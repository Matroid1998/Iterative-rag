Description:
A new pectin-based phytocomplex obtained via hydrodynamic cavitation in water.

Text:
IntegroPectin is the name given in 2020 to a new pectinbased phytocomplex 
obtained in Italy via hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) in water only of the fresh 
residue of the industrial manufacturing of lemon juice sourced from organically 
grown lemon fruits.1 Generally sourced from dried lemon and orange peel 
using mineral acid in hot water followed by precipitation with alcohol,2 pectin 
is the most valued food hydrocolloid,3 and natures structurally most complex 
polysaccharide.4 

In brief, pectin is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of a galacturonic acid 
polymer with homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan (RGI, RGII), 
arabinogalacturonan (AG), and xylogalacturonan (XGA) regions, consisting of 
repeating units of (14)DGalA (galactopyranosyluronic acid) residues, 
partly methylesterified at O6 position and at lower extent also acetyl
esterified at O2 or O3.
