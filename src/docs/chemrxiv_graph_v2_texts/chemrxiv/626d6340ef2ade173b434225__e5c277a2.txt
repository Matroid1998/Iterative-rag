Description:
A class of compounds with high activity and physicochemical tunability used in CO2 reduction reactions.

Text:
A carbonneutral, or even 
negative, cycle demands viable approaches to capture and convert CO2 into compounds with 
added value.2,3 Consequently, a great deal of research is ongoing toward means to promote the 
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).4,5 Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) of the 
general formula MX2 (M 4 or 5 metal, XSTe) constitute a class of compounds attracting 
interest for this purpose thanks to high activity and physicochemical tunability.6 Beyond CO2RR, 
TMDCs have shown broad catalytic activity towards other reactions, such as oxygen reduction,7 
hydrodesulfurization,8,9 and hydrogen evolution (HER).10,11 Among TMDCs, MoS2 has the most 
established track record as a CO2RR electrocatalyst,12,13 thus serving a good model system to 
uncover fundamental underpinnings of function that may apply to TMDCs as a class of materials.
