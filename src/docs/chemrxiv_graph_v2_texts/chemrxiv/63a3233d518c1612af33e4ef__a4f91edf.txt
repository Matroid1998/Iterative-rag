Inorganic twodimensional (2D) materials particularly transition metal dichalcogenides 
13 
(TMDs) have raised significant attention due to their exceptional electronic, optical, 
14 
mechanical, and chemical properties.1,2 Notably, the large surface area with tunable 
15 
electronic properties, the intercalable layers and bio functionalization holds great promise in 
16 
biosensing,35 bioimaging,6,7 and drug delivery,810 among others applications.11 In 
17 
particular, molybdenum disulfide, a graphene analogue consisting of SMoS covalent 
18 
arrangements12 is one of the commercially attractive materials used as catalyst, lubricant, 
19 
welding, and combustion.2 Furthermore, MoS2 nanosheets have shown to have better 
20 
biocompatibility and stability in comparison with their carbonbased analogues,13,14 and 
21 
other TMD materials,15 as well as degradation capacity in an aqueous environment.16 Prior 
22 
studies evaluated the adverse effects of MoS2 in vitro17 or in vivo18 highlighting the MoS2 
23 
biotransformation into the oxidized form, like molybdenum oxide (MoO4), and the 
24 
incorporation of molybdenum into molybdenum enzymes, affecting liver metabolism.1821 
25 
Heavy metals and particularly molybdenum exposure has been related to health hazards such 
26 
as fetal growth disturbance,22 systemic sclerosis,23 or chronic kidney disease.24 Depending 
27 
on the form of TMD and the exfoliation degrees, in vitro studies demonstrated different levels 
28 
of cytotoxicity.25,26 Additionally, differences in the antibacterial activity were observed 
29 
between exfoliated MoS2 and annealed MoS2 in combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
30 
acid (EDTA) as an electron donor.
