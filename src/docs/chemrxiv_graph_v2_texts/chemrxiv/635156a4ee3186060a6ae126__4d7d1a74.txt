Description:
A compound synthesized from ethanol and acetaldehyde, used in synthetic rubber production.

Biobased processes are currently considered as potential candidates to substitute the petroleum 
industry, in particular bioethanol valorisation.37 The production of bioethanol reached 
120 billion litres in 2017 and is expected to rise above 130 billion litres by 2024.3 This 
important platform molecule has a wide array of applications,4, 5 among which the catalytic 
upgrading to butadiene is attracting a lot of attention.3, 814 Historically, Ostromislensky et al. proposed in 1915 a process to synthesize butadiene from a mixture of ethanol and acetaldehyde 
15. During the 1930s, another industrial process developed by Lebedev emerged where 
butadiene is obtained directly from ethanol 16. The technology made it possible to produce 
synthetic rubber, notably during the Second World War.

Description:
Produced through a complex network of dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer, and dehydration steps.

After the Second World War, 
petroleumbased processes took over 1, and research on the subject declined until the last 10
15 years. Nowadays, a blooming interest in biobased processes for the substitution of the 
petroleum industry is observed 36. In this context, the Lebedev process is considered more 
interesting from an environmental and economic point of view compared to the Ostromislensky 
3. For acid catalysts, the generally accepted reaction mechanism is the Kagan mechanism, 
consisting of a complex network of dehydrogenation, hydrogen transfer and dehydration steps 
(Scheme 1) 17, 18. To trigger the different types of reactions and obtain butadiene, a bifunctional
