Description:
A hydrated, disordered form that undergoes oxidation to form NiOOH.

Text:
The NiOOH phase is 
unstable at open circuit potential, but is created when polarizing 
the Ni(OH)2 phase, of which two polymorphs exist, where 
Ni(OH)2 is a hydrated, disordered form of Ni(OH)2.17,18 
Charging of Ni(OH)2 first leads to an oxidation of Ni2 to Ni3 and 
a phase change to NiOOH. Upon further charging, the oxidation 
state of Ni increases up to Ni3.66 and a NiOOH phase is formed. When starting with Ni(OH)2, immediately NiOOH crystallizes 
upon polarization.

Description:
Formed by reducing NiOOH with reversible intercalation of cations.

Text:
In contrast to NiOOH, in NiOOH, both H2O 
and ions, including alkali metal cations, are intercalated.1921 With 
XAS, the intercalation of the cations was shown to be reversible 
when reducing the sample back to Ni(OH)2.21 Yet, the nuances 
of the phase transitions and structures are still a matter of 
debate.22,23 For instance, Garcia et al.24 have shown the 
formation of NiOO at 1.7 V vs. RHE with Raman spectroscopy. The peroxo band increases when using different electrolytes from 
LiOH to NaOH, KOH, and finally CsOH. In the same manner, the 
current density increased during the OER. They propose that the 
NiOOM species acts as an intermediate of the OER.
