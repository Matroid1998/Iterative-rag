Description:
Disubstituted acids that undergo decarboxylation with outstanding stereoselectivity catalyzed by AMDase.

Text:
They achieve this stabilization by acidbase catalysis 
and the assistance of the substrate as an intermediary electron sink. In this paper, we propose a fourth 
mechanistic principle for cofactorfree decarboxylation by enzymes (Figure 1). AMDase catalyzes the decarboxylation of disubstituted aryl and alkenylmalonic acids with outstanding 
stereoselectivity.2d The selectivity is outstanding, giving access to a large series of the corresponding 
aarylpropionic acids and aalkenylpropionic acids.2e aChiral carboxylic acids play a fundamental role 
as structural components in many active pharmaceutical ingredients. Few enzymatic reactions provide 
access to these building blocks, and their selectivity is often limited. Consequently, AMDase has received 
considerable attention.
