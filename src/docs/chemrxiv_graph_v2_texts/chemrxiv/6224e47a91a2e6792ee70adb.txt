Description:
A common target of photosensitization, where it is excited from its ground triplet state to its singlet state.

Text:
Photosensitization is a light mediated physical reaction, where the molecule irradiated with
light is not the nal target of electronic excitation. Here, a photosensitizer (PS), is photoexcited
and then transfers its excitation energy to the target molecule, leading to its excitation, while the
PS returns to its ground state. A common target of photosensitization is the oxygen molecule since
direct photoexcitation from its ground triplet state, 3O2, to its singlet state, 1O2, is spinforbidden,
and this reaction (Eq. 1) is the focus of this study. 3PS3 O21PS1 O2

Photosensitization of O2 is widely made use of in organic synthesis 15, photovoltaics 6,
and is also a key step in photodynamic therapy 79.
