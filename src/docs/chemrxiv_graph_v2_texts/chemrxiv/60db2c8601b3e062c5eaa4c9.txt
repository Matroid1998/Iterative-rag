Description:
Forms linear molecules with molecular orbitals that can exhibit helical topology.

Text:
Molecular orbitals (MOs) have long been an essential tool in the toolbox of chemists. While
they are not physical observables, they have nonetheless been used to develop intuition for
and predict physical properties.15 Recently, the MOs of some linear carbon molecules
have received increased attention due to their helical topology.616 An example of such a
proclaimed helical orbital is shown in Figure 1. This is the HOMO of S1,5Me4cumulene
and it is clearly shaped like a helix.
