Description:
An essential element for the survival of all living organisms.

Text:
Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for the survival of all 
living organisms on our planet. Over 90 of P in all the living 
beings on earth originated from ores, nonrenewable resources 1, 
2. The world population has been about 8.1 billion so far 
according to the most recent United Nations estimates, which will 
spur a growing demand for more mineral fertilizers for food 
production. This will no doubt accelerate the depletion of global 
phosphate rock reserves since more than 90 of P ores were 
consumed in the production of fertilizers 35. Moreover, quite 
much of P fertilizers are lost from the croplands or forestlands into 
waterways due to soil erosion 2 and find their way to the ocean 
eventually 6.

Description:
An element essential for life, involved in the natural phosphorus cycle.

Text:
Such a oneway phosphorus flow (i.e., P flux from 
rock to ocean) is unsustainable considering the limitation in the 
supply of accessible phosphate rocks, and the impossibility of 
geologically replenishing these ores by natural phosphorus cycle 
7. It is therefore pressingly needed to develop efficient P 
recovery and recycling strategies for reclaiming this valuable 
element from Prich streams and effluents (viz. secondary P 
resources), thus implementing a closed P cycle in the context of the 
circular economy. Chemical precipitation has been demonstrated as one of the most 
promising approaches for P recovery from waste streams 811.
