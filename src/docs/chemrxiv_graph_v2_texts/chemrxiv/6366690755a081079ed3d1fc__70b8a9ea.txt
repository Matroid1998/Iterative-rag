Description:
Involves electron transfer between CuCu2 and a surface Fe3 species in its dissolution.

Text:
Copper is the noblest of the 3rd transition metals. It can form two stable passivating oxides at 
neutral pHs, depending on the potential (Parsons, 1967). The fabrication of copper oxides and 
copper ions in different morphologies has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their 
potential application in so many fields such as energy conversion, electrode materials, catalysis, 
etc (Gawande et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). The main feature of the copperenhanced 
mechanism for the dissolution of synthetic magnetite is the electron transfer between CuCu2 
and a surface Fe3 species (Zeng et al., 2012).

Description:
A major corrosion product formed under high temperatures and pressure on reactor coolant system surfaces.

Text:
Several metal oxides including magnetite, nickel ferrite, and chromite can be deposited on the 
surfaces of structures like pipes and other equipment, especially when they come into contact with 
the reactor coolant (Lee et al., 2020). Of the various metal oxides formed in NPPs, magnetite is 
one of the major corrosion products. Magnetite is formed under high temperatures (270C) and 
pressure (around 16 MPa) on the surfaces of the reactor coolant system. Magnetite dissolution and
