Description:
A surface alloy proposed as a possible active site in COX hydrogenation.

In addition to particle size and distributions, bimetallic 
catalysts can form various interfaces and alloys.1619 As a result, understanding NPs at a molecular level is challenging, even when using stateof
theart in situoperando spectroscopic techniques and computational modelling.20 
In that context, the structure and the active sites of CuZnOAl2O3, a catalyst used for COX hydrogenation, have been debated for decades.2124 
Possible active sites proposed in the literature include a CuZn surface alloy, Zn species at the Cu steps, ZnOX (over)layers on Cu, and the ZnO
Cu interface, among others.2533 Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC), augmented with advanced computational methods, a powerful 
approach to understanding such catalysts at the molecular level,34,35 has been applied to supported Cu nanoparticles on ZrO2 or Zrdoped silica 
surfaces, pinpointed the role of the interface between the Cu NPs and the oxide support.3639 Corresponding works on supported Cu nanoparticles 
on Zn or Gadoped silicas have shown increased complexity, forming alloys under reducing conditions with dealloying under CO2 
hydrogenation conditions, further illustrating the possible dynamics involved in these catalysts.40,41 The combination of ab initio thermodynamics 
on slab models with experimental data has indicated that Cu remains metallic under both CO and CO2 hydrogenation conditions,42 while the 
promoters (Zn or Ga) could be oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation and related conditions.19 Furthermore, the redox state has been shown to 
oscillate with respect to the exact reaction conditions (more reducing or oxidizing, depending on the CO2 content) and to depend very much on 
the amount of the promoters, especially for Ga, promoting or poisoning the catalysts by enabling or not the redox process.43 Thus, further 
calculations are needed to capture the possible dynamics involved in these catalysts.
