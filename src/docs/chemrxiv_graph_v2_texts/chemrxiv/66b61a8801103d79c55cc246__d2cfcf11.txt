Description:
A nanocluster synthesized by controlling reaction conditions, with HER activity similar to Au24Pt(C6)180.

Text:
The new NC, Au24Pt(TBBT)180 (TBBT  4
tertbutylbenzenethiolate; Figure S1d; 2; Table 1),26,27 were 
synthesized by controlling the reaction temperature, reaction 
time, and TBBTH (4tertbutylbenzenethiol) concentration. However, the HER activity of this new material is similar to 
those previously reported for Au24Pt(C6)180. This outcome is 
attributed to the similar Au24PtS18 frame structures of the cata
lysts and the similar length of the ligands (C6 and TBBT). These ligands stabilize Au24Pt NCs but restrict the access of 
protons (H) to the Au12Pt metal cores serving as the active sites 
for the HER. To improve the HER activity of SRprotected 
Au24Pt NCs, the access of H to the Au12Pt core has to be in
creased by tuning the structure.
