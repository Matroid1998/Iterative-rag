Description:
Used to access octahedral metal-organic cages.

Text:
Metalorganic polyhedra (MOPs) or metalorganic cages 
(MOCs) are assembled through the coordination of organic 
ligands to metal nodes giving discrete molecules that contain a 
defined cavity.15 The shape of this cavity arises from the 
combination of the bonding preferences of the metal node with 
the geometry and denticity of the ligand(s) used in the 
synthesis.67 Homoleptic cages contain one type of ligand, and 
examples of this approach include the use of 3,3((1,3
phenylene)bis(ethyne2,1diyl))dibenzoic 
acid 
or 
1,3
bis(pyridin3ylethynyl)benzene 
derivatives 
to 
synthesise 
lanterntype 
cages;813 
carbazole 
derivatives 
to 
access 
octahedral cages;1416 and isophthalic acid or 1,3di(pyridine4
yl)benzene derivatives to synthesise cuboctahedral cages.1722 
Alternatively, two or more types of ligand can be used, giving 
heteroleptic cages, increasing the complexity of the assembly as 
now the geometry of the cage will be determined by 
contributions from the bonding angles as well as the relative 
lengths of the ligands.
