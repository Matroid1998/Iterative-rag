Description:
A key component in next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Solidstate batteries are currently considered as nextgeneration lithiumion batteries, the goal 
being to replace flammable organic lithium conducting electrolytes with solidstate ionic 
conductors.1 A variety of material classes are being considered, but sulfide electrolytes have 
attracted substantial interest due to their high ionic conductivity and favorable mechanical 
properties. Here, the families of Li10(GeSn)P2S12 and Li6(PSb)S5X (X  Cl, Br, I) are, so far, the 
only Li compounds exceeding 10 mS cm1 at room temperature.24 The structure and transport of 
these materials have been widely investigated, and the ionic conductivities have been pushed 
continually higher, reaching values reasonable for solidstate battery operation. While both are 
excellent ionic conductors, they have fundamentally different crystal structures.
