Description:
Studied for charge migration in its cationic form.

Text:
The 
coherent superposition and charge migration decay in 15  20 fs because the vibrational wavepackets on 
the X and A potential energy surfaces move in opposite directions.1215 Charge migration has also been 
studied in a number of other systems, including some closely related molecules, HCCBr, H(CC)nBr and 
H(CC)nI cations,1719 but not in HCCCl and HCCF. One of the challenges for calculating the electronic structure of HCCX cations is that the X and A states 
have the same electronic state symmetry. Consequently, calculations of the A state with conventional 
density functional methods and single reference correlated wavefunctions such as coupled clusters (CC) 
would collapse to the X state.
