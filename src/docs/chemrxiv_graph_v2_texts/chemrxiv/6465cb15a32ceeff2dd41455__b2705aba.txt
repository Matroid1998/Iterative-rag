Description:
Involved in reversible complexation with a crownether moiety in a Rh complex.

Text:
have reported an example 
that relies predominantly on an electrostatic interactions17,18 involving the reversible 
complexation of Na and a crownether moiety included in a Rh complex that bears Aza
CrownPhos; the reactivity of the Rh complex can be regulated through the Namediated 
interconversion.19 The authors evaluated the change in the spatial environment around the Rh 
center using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry, even though a 
quantitative evaluation of how much the field expandeddiminished via the reaction was not 
discussed. Herein, we present a novel strategy to reversibly transform the spatial environment 
around a nickel center by combining (S)PoxIms 1ad (Figure 1C) as multifunctional ligands and
