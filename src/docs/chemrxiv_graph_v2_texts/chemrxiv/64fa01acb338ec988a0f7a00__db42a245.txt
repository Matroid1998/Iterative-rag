Description:
Achieves high conversion rates when using lanthanum-modified catalysts.

Text:
Analysis results displays that the
Lanthanum (La) modified catalysts reaches the highest ammonia conversion. To boost the catalytic performance
of this (La)modified NiAl2O3 catalyst a pretreatment step was required. Hence, 400 C and 600 C as
calcination, and reduction temperature respectively shows the highest NH3 conversion as high as 94 at 550 C.
Moreover, it is notified from Lis work 24 that lanthanum (La) is the best choice for improving the nickel
dispersion and the ratio of metallic to acid functions among rare earth elements. Indeed, due to this fact, high
