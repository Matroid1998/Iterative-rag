Description:
A high molecular weight semicrystalline polymer known for its exceptional chemical resistance.

Text:
Poly(tetrafluoro)ethylene (PTFE) is produced on an estimated 2 x 108 kg  year scale through a 
multistep process that converts fluorite (CaF2) to HF to CHClF2 to C2F4, which is then subject to a radical 
polymerisation.1 PTFE is a highmolecular weight semicrystalline polymer and is among the most 
chemically resistant materials in existence. PTFE finds applications as a wire coating and insulation, in 
nonstick cookware, in weatherresistant materials, alongside many others such as in carbon fibre 
composites, aerosol lubricants and in military grade pyrotechnics. Despite its widespread use, current 
methods for recycling or destruction of PTFE are limited and there is an urgent need to establish 
methods for its remediation.
