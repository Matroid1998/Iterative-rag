Description:
A metal whose salts are used in photoredox catalysis, facilitating transformations in organic synthesis.

Text:
Rareearth metal ions (Sc, Y, lanthanides) have 
attracted significant attention, mainly due to their 
Lewis acidity and oxophilicity. In particular, 
Sc(OTf)3 has been introduced in recent decades as a 
promising Lewis acid for CH functionalisation and 
CC bond formation reactions.1,2 In the past 20 years, 
scandium salts have also effectively assumed a role 
in photoredox catalysisa process that has emerged 
as a fullfledged alternative in organic synthesis, 
often unlocking transformations that are not 
attainable in the dark.36 Photoredox catalysis relies 
on an electron transfer process between a highly 
reactive, lightexcited catalyst and a redoxlabile 
substrate (S). The result is a reactive radical 
intermediate that undergoes further transformations, 
ultimately resulting in the formation of new bonds 
under mild conditions.

Description:
A redox-inactive metal with a predominantly trivalent redox-stable state.

Text:
Photoredox catalysis requires a catalyst that is both 
photochemically and redox activetypically a 
compound derived from an organic dye or a complex 
of a redoxactive metal, such as ruthenium or iridium 
(see 
Fig. 1a).710 
Conversely, 
redox
inactiveinnocent metals, such as scandium, which 
have a predominantly trivalent redoxstable state, are 
not directly involved in photoredox reactions.1113 
Nevertheless, 
these 
metals, 
and 
particularly 
Sc(OTf)3, can serve as Lewis acids (LA) that activate 
substratesorganophotocatalysts by altering their 
redox characteristics, thereby facilitating their 
participation in photoredox and photosensitisation 
reactions (Figs. 1b and 1c).1215 For instance, the 
redox properties of a flavin derivative (Fl) were 
significantly enhanced via their coordination to 
Sc(OTf)3.

Commonly used as Lewis acids in chemical reactions.

These unprecedented procedures dispel the 
usual notion of scandium salts as redoxinactive 
species useful mostly as Lewis acids and expand 
their possible application as simple, readily available
