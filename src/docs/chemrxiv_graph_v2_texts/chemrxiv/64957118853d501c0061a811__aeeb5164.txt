Description:
Used in stabilizer systems as a replacement for cadmium and lead.

Text:
Currently, available hazard data 
69 
indicate that these alternative plasticizers are likely safer than orthophthalates, but they are 
70 
generally less wellstudied, including a lack of important physicochemical or toxicological data for 
71 
some of them.11 Nevertheless, at least tris(2ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP, CASRN 78422, 
72 
likely persistent), tricresyl phosphate (TCP, CASRN 1330785, likely toxic for reproduction), 
73 
and tris(2ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM, CASRN 3319311, likely persistent and endocrine 
74 
disrupting) have shown some cause for concern.11,12

PVC requires heat and UV stabilization, as it is intrinsically unstable due to molecular defects.5 
76 
Earlier stabilizer systems were mainly based on cadmium and lead, which are known for posing 
77 
health and environmental risks.13,14 The PVC industry in the EU voluntarily phased out cadmium 
78 
or leadbased stabilizer systems in 2001 and 2015, respectively, and replaced them with (organo) 
79 
tin, barium and calciumbased systems.7,15,16 Yet, some of these replacements may still lead to
