Description:
Layered compounds where M is a transition metal, used as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.

Text:
Nevertheless,
SIBs are seen as an excellent alternative costeffective and sustainable technology for applications
where weight is not important such as stationary storage, key for the development of electrical
grids 1. Due to their analogy with their Liion counterparts, layered NaxMO2 compounds, where M
is a transition metal, are amongst the most studied cathode materials for Naion batteries 1, 4. NaxMO2 compounds have a layered crystal structure where Naions are accommodated in between
n transition metal layers MO2 per unit cell where each Naion can occupy octahedral(O) sites, On
type compounds, or trigonal prismatic sites (P), Pntype compounds 5. The crystal structure of
these compounds has a great influence on Naion transport and stability during battery operation
6.
