Twodimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have garnered signicant
attention in recent years due to their unique properties
and potential for use in a wide range of applications,
including electronics, energy storage, and optoelectron
ics 146. However, the properties of these materials
are often signicantly inuenced by defects, such as pre
deected cracks, which can alter their mechanical behav
ior. In this research paper, we aim to investigate the im
pact of predeected cracks on the mechanical properties
of 2D materials and 3D printable parts, and to explore
the potential for engineering these defects to optimize the
performance of these materials in various applications.
