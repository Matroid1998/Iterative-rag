Description:
A coordinating Lewis-basic group used to stabilize intermediate metallocycles.

Text:
Krische and coworkers have reported an alternative 
27 
strategy that instead yields the linear product. Relying on rutheniumcatalysis, this direct allylation of tertiary 
28 
alcohols requires a coordinating Lewisbasic group  either an ester group21 or a heterocycle22 (Scheme 
29 
1c)  to stabilise the intermediate metallocycle. Therefore, it is evident that a new tactic to allow entry to 
30 
linear products with simple ketone coupling partners would be an attractive development for the field as an
