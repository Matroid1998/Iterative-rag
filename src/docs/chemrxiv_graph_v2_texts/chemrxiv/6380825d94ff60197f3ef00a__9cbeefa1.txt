Description:
Membranes used for spotting E.coli expression clones, ensuring consistent protein concentrations.

Text:
The 
extensive usage of the protein microarrays can be attributed to two innate characteristics unique 
to the platform i) E.coli expression clones are spotted directly on PVDF membranes, ensuring 
consistent protein concentrations intrinsic to each individual expression clone, thereby avoiding 
the need for cumbersome largescale protein purification and characterisation procedures 
essential for the generation of most protein microarray formats; and ii) each individual colony 
spot on the macroarray comprises of a single recombinant human protein and a collection of all 
E.coli proteins, thereby providing a natural blocking background consistent across the entire 
array and hence ensuring excellent experimental signal to noise ratios 20.
