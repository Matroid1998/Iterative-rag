Description:
A star-shaped diblock copolymer with dual pH-responsive behavior.

The CRP methods mainly include 
nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP), atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), or reversible 
addition fragmentation polymerization (RAFT).8, 9 In 2019 Hawker et al. reported on minimizing starstar 
coupling in Cu(0)mediated controlled radical polymerizations. They synthesized different starshaped 
homo and block copolymers using a variety of acrylates resulting in conversions up to 95 and dispersities 
() below 1.2 and investigated critical factors like the influence of arm length, the number of arms, or the 
monomer side chain used.10 Later in 2020 Lin et al. reported starshaped double hydrophilic copolymers 
containing pHresponsive blocks describing the synthesis and the dual pHresponsive behavior of star
shaped poly(4vinyl pyridine)blockpoly(acrylic acid) (P4VPbPAA) diblock copolymers.
