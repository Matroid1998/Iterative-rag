Description:
Groups that enhance spin-orbit coupling, facilitating intersystem crossing in organic RTP materials.

Organic roomtemperature phosphorescence (RTP) is most relevant to a wide range of 
applications, including bioimaging1,2, anticounterfeiting3,4, organic lightemitting diode5,6, X
ray scintillator7,8 and information storage technologies9,10. The key attributes of such systems 
is flexible structural design and tunable optical performance. Generally, two main principles 
are operative in organic RTP materials9,1114. The first involves intersystem crossing (ISC) by 
singlet excitons conversion to triplet excitons. As the dominant driving force of ISC, strong 
and efficient spinorbit coupling (SOC) can be realized by introducing aromatic carbonyl 
groups, deuterated carbon atoms, halogens, and heteroatoms with lonepair electrons. (The 
second principle relates to radiative migration of triplet excitons to the ground state, which is 
usually achieved by rigidifying the chromophores via crystallization, polymerization and 
matrix solidification.
