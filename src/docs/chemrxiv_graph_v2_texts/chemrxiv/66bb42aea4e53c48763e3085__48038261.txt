Description:
Demonstrated enhanced tolerance to external conditions, with interest in 2-substituted variants for stability modulation.

Recently, an overwhelmingly increased interest to potential drug 
substances enriched in sp3hydbrid carbon atoms the led to 
increased exploitation of small cycloalkyl groups and their 
heterocyclic analogs in medicinal chemistry.1013 Oxetane, an 
oxaanalog of the cyclobutane ring, was unfairly omitted from the 
drug discovery campaigns until early 2000s, when its application 
as hydrophilic gemdimethyl14 or metabolically stable carbonyl15 
surrogate was demonstrated.16 Since then, a large (and still 
growing) number of oxetanecentered studies have been reported 
in the literature, revealing a special place of this ring as a 
promising core for bioisosteric replacements.1719 
A major bias that suspended the application of oxetanes in drug 
discovery is connected with its potential liability under certain 
conditions.15,18 
Refuting 
this 
statement, 
recent 
studies 
demonstrated the enhanced tolerance of 3,3disubstituted 
oxetanes to the external conditions20,21 despite several reported 
exclusions related to the specific structural environment.22 
With increased interest in 2substituted oxetanes,16,18,19,23 
application of the Fluorinecontaining substituents aimed at 
modulation of the stability andor other molecular properties could 
be regarded as a promising approach to the development of novel 
oxetanebased functional groups (Figure 1, bottom).
