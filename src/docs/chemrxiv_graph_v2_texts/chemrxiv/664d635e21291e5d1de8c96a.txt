Description:
A two-dimensional material with a graphenelike structure partially modified with oxygen functional groups.

This method is wellknown as metal
assisted chemical etching (MacEtch)6,7. Although MacEtch is facile and less expensive than 
dry etching, there are still some issues to be solved for its practical use. First, residual noble 
metals may produce deeplevel traps in semiconductors and adversely affect device 
performance8. In order to replace noble metals in the wet process, there have been several 
reports about the assisted chemical etching of semiconductors with nonnoble metals9,10,11,12 
and nanocarbon materials13,14,15,16 as catalysts. Graphene oxide (GO) is a twodimensional 
material that has a graphenelike structure partially modified with oxygen functional groups. Kubota et al. successfully applied GO as a catalyst for the etching of silicon17,18,19, and InP20.
