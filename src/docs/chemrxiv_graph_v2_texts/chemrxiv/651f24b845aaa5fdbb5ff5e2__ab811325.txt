Description:
A volatile organic solvent used in the capture of carbon dioxide.

Text:
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major greenhouse gases that poses a direct threat to the 
environment and human health1, 2. In the ongoing search for environmentfriendly solvents to 
capture CO2, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have gained considerable attention as promising 
alternatives to volatile organic solvents (e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, toluene, 
xylene, and benzene) due to their lower volatilities, higher thermal stabilities, tuneable 
properties, and enhanced environmental sustainabilities35. DESs are a class of solvents 
comprised of two or more solid or liquid components, often a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and 
a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), that form a eutectic mixture that exhibits a significantly 
lowered melting point compared to the individual components57.
