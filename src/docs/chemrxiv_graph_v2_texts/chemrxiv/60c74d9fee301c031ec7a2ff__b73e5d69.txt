Description:
A thiol derivative of Val used as a junction to increase access to alternative ligation strategies.

Unfortunately, peptide segments are often too 
insoluble to reach these ideal concentrations, even in denaturing conditions.28 While 
many groups have developed strategies to increase peptide solubility,2831 these do not 
overcome the inherent issue of requiring high concentrations.32 Additionally, the 
availability of suitable Cys or Ala ligation junctions is limited for many synthesis projects, 
forcing the selection of suboptimal segments for NCL.11, 33 Although alternative thiol
containing amino acids, such as penicillamine (thiol derivative of Val), can be used as 
junctions to increase access to alternative ligation strategies, these often suffer from
