Description:
A compound synthesized as described in a patent.

Text:
Both routes rely on the modification of the already installed 
functional groups (a) oxidation of the thiomethyl group;4 and (b) 
metalmediated crosscoupling of halidesboronates with sodium 
sulfinate5,6 or sulphur dioxidemethyl iodide (Figure 1).7,8,9,10 ,11 
Here, we present a principally novel approach to methyl 
sulfones that relies on the 1,3heterocycle disconnection logic 
with the newly developed reagent 1 (Figure 1). Results and discussion 
Background. In our daily practice, we often use two standard 
approaches to methyl sulfones described above (Figure 1). Recently, we received a request from a pharmaceutical 
company for a synthesis of pyrazole 2 (Scheme 1), which was 
described in a patent before.12 In that method, bromide 3 was 
treated first with nBuLi followed by the addition of (MeS)2.
