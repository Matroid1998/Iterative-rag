Description:
An amorphous solid electrolyte studied for its role and impact on filament formation and growth.

Text:
In addition to this, interphase formation
in unstable anode  SE interphases leads to large area specic resistances that cause strong
electric and stress elds leading to the fracture of the solid electrolyte23,24. For metastable
interfaces, microstructuredriven, Grithlike cracking processes are also identied over and
above the mass transport limitation mechanism22. Additionally, local deposition of Li metal
due to trace electrical conductivities of material is also identied as a potential failure mech
anism for the solid electrolytes12,13. Understanding the role and impact of heterogenities
in the interface, interphase, and SE on lament formation and growth is vital. While a lot
of work has been done on assessing these interplay for amorphous solid electrolytes (like
Li3PS6)25,4,26,27,28,29, relatively much less work is carried out for polycrystalline solid elec
trolytes.
