Description:
An oxidant used to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids at elevated temperatures.

Text:
11 Using
ammonium persulfate as the oxidant and silver ni
trate as the catalyst, alkyl radicals are generated from
the corresponding carboxylic acids at elevated tem
peratures. Upon radical addition to the heteroarene,
the reaction product is formed through aromaticity
driven oxidation of the radical intermediate. 11 The
scope of both, electrondeficient heteroarenes and alkyl
donating coupling partners,
has steadily been ex
panded. 12, 13 Different radical sources have been re
ported, such as alkyl carboxylic acids capable of trans
ferring alkyl groups, boronic acids suitable for the in
corporation of aryl groups, or sulfinates that were used
to transfer trifluoromethyl or tertbutyl fragments.
