Description:
A proposed species formed upon O2 activation treatments of Cu-exchanged zeolites.

The dependence of methanol yields (per Cu) on re
action conditions (e.g., reactant pressure, temperature, 
time) has been well studied;11, 14, 17, 2324 however, compara
tively few investigations describe the series of steps respon
sible for the activation of O2 molecules or the kinetics and 
formation of active CuxOy complexes.11, 22, 24 
Nearly two decades of research have sought to identify 
the CuxOy species that form upon O2 activation treatments 
of Cuexchanged zeolites and produced numerous pro
posals (e.g., bis(oxo)dicopper,1, 10 mono(oxo)dicop
