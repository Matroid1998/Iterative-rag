Description:
Substrates activated by palladium catalysis, facing challenges like slow oxidative addition rates and facile hydride elimination from PdII-alkyl intermediates.

While the majority of these transformations are proposed to proceed through traditional Pd0PdII 
catalytic cycles, there are notable exceptions in which palladium promotes the formation of organic 
radicals in the ground state.13 As early as 1985 it was known that common Pd0phosphine complexes 
absorb light in the visible region and possess longlived excited triplet states,4,5 but in the last decade 
visible lightdriven palladium catalysis has drawn significant attention.610 With palladium complexes 
acting as photocatalysts that harvest photons, and subsequently reacting through their excited triplet 
states for bondbreaking or bondforming steps, these transformations are quite distinct from those 
employing nonPdbased photocatalysts.1113 Reports in this area have primarily focused on the 
activation of organic halides, principally alkyl halides, fuelled by the inherent problems of employing 
these substrates using groundstate palladium catalysis, namely slow oxidative addition rates and 
facile hydride elimination from PdIIalkyl intermediates.
