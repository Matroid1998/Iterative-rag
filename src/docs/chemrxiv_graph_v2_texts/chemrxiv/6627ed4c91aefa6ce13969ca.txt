Description:
A nucleoside inhibitor of DNMT methylation approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.

Text:
Although the physical samples (compound material) of the 
compounds are readily available for experimental screening in, for example, highthroughput or medium
throughput mode, the chemical structures are publicly accessible and can be used for benchmarking 
computational studies. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are one of the main epigenetic target families with clinical relevance 
79. DNMTs include two de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and the maintenance 
methyltransferase DNMT1 (the most abundant DNMT), which is in charge of duplicating the pattern of DNA 
methylation during replication, and it is necessary for adequate mammalian development. Two nucleoside 
inhibitors of DNMT methylation, azacitidine and decitabine, have been approved by the FDA to treat 
myelodysplastic syndrome 10.
