Description:
Involved in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as part of electrocatalytic processes.

Text:
These electrocatalytic processes include,
most notably, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), along with re
duction reactions of carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxy
gen (ORR) 3542. In terms of catalyst performance, the sheets of
MoX2 are generally regarded comparable owning apparent structural
and chemical similarities. Consequently, among these, 2D MoS2 has
garnered particular attention as an electrocatalyst, largely due to its
greater availability compared to other TMDs 4244. However, while
this perspective holds to some extent, it is incomplete and reflects a
common misconception about the physicochemical properties of MoX2
sheets. This misconception arises from the many wellknown similarities
shared by MoS2, MoSe2 and MoTe2. These materials have a common
structure, bonding configuration, and general surface interaction mech
