Description:
The HCN(v) vibrational distribution presents controversies among different experimental groups.

Text:
As a consequence of this kinematic 
condition the dynamics is governed by corner cutting on the skewed potential energy 
surface and two important effects appear firstly, a priori, at low temperatures tunnelling 
should play a significant role, although in this particular reaction with a very low barrier, 
this effect is negligible, and secondly, substantial vibrational excitation would be 
expected, especially in the triatomic product;13 iii) The HCN(v) vibrational distribution 
presents controversies among different experimental groups. Bethardy et al.4 found that 
the HCN(v1,0,v3) states (i.e., bendless excitation) are not initially populated, while 
Copeland et al.5 and Morris et al.6 previously reported noticeable excitation of the bending 
mode.

Involved in the chemistry of low and ultralow temperature environments, planetary atmospheres, and interstellar clouds.

Text:
In this case, the three vibrational modes of HCN are described as CN stretch (v1), 
bend (v2), and CH stretch (v3), and are all IR active;7 iv) A fulldimensional potential 
energy surface is not available for this reaction; and finally, v) Its interest in the chemistry 
of low and ultralow temperature environments, in the chemistry of planetary 
atmospheres8 and of interstellar clouds,9,10 and also at high temperatures, in hydrocarbon 
fuel combustion processes (through the nitric oxide chemistry cycle).11,12
