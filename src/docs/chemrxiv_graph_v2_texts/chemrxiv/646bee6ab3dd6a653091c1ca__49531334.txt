Description:
A single-phase rocksalt entropy-stabilized compound with stable long-term capacity retention and high power density performance.

Text:
A recently 
synthesized singlephase rocksalt entropystabilized transition metal oxide, (MgCoNiCuZn)O 
(ref.10) (TMHEO), has been demonstrated to have stable longterm capacity retention and high 
power density performance, reaching more than 400 mAh g1 of capacity at a current density of 3 
A g1 (ref. 11,12). The high electrochemical performance of these micrometersize particles has 
been attributed to the entropy stabilization effect observed in this material11,12. The idea of 
entropy playing a role in the electrochemical performance of lithiumion battery electrodes is not
