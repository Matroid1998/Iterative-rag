Description:
A solvent that forms colorful solutions with alkali metals.

Text:
The spectacularly colourful solutions of alkali metals in
liquid ammonia have attracted attention of researchers
since the 19th century (for a comprehensive review see
Ref. 1, 2).

Description:
Liquid ammonia serves as a solvent for alkali metals, facilitating gradual concentration transitions.

Text:
In contrast to su
percritical mercury,8 alkali metals dissolved in liquid am
monia do not exhibit a sharp transition, but a gradual one
in the concentration range of about 110 MPM (mole per
cent metal; in liquid ammonia, 1 MPM equals to roughly
0.4 M).2,5
Three historical models have been suggested for the
EMT in alkali metalliquid ammonia systems2 (i) a per
colation model based on experimental findings of micro
scopic inhomogeneities,9 (ii) an extension of the Landau
and Zeldovich model introducing a critical electron den
sity for metallisation,10,11 and (iii) a model linking the
transition to a polarisation catastrophe.12 Despite these
efforts, the molecular mechanism underlying the EMT
remains inconclusive.

Description:
Forms solutions with alkali metals that exhibit concentration fluctuations and structural inhomogeneities.

Text:
A phenomenon that has been closely connected to
the EMT mechanism concerns inhomogeneities or fluc
tuations of concentration occurring in the alkali metal
ammonia solutions in the intermediate range of 18
MPM.13,14 Experimental evidence for microscopic struc
tural inhomogeneities was first provided by Xray diffrac
tion studies.15 Subsequently, large concentration fluctu
ations in lithium and sodium ammonia solutions were
deduced from investigations of the dependence of the
chemical potential on the alkali metal concentration.16
Finally, the nanometersized correlation lengths of the
fluctuations were derived from smallangle neutron scat
tering studies.17 Based on these experimental studies, a
model was proposed suggesting the coexistence of dilute
and concentrated voids in the intermediate concentra
tion regime, which accounted for the spatial dimensions
of the inhomogeneities.18 However, no temporal informa
tion about these fluctuations has been provided so far,
