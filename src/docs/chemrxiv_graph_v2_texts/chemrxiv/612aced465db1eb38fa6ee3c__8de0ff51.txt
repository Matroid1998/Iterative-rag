Description:
Shows inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme in vitro.

Concerning SARSCoV2 Mpro, 
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 8,9, theaflavin 8, myricetin 10, quercetin 11, 
herbacetin, pectolinarin, baicalin 12, rutin, baicalein 13, and cyanidin3glucoside 
65 
14 shows inhibitory effects on the enzyme in vitro. Most research was performed by 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, which sometimes results in false 
negatives or positives due to the interference of fluorescence signals derived from test 
chemicals 15; a competitive binding assay using the fluorescent probe 8
anilinonaphthalene1sulfonate is also reported 13. 70 
The study examines the inhibitory effect of food phytochemicals by directly 
measuring the digested peptide substrate after highperformance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) separation.
