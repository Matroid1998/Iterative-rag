Description:
Combines with carbon to form a plethora of structures and chemical environments.

Text:
Carbon (C), one of the most abundant elements in nature, displays various types of hy
bridized bonds, contributing to a rich energy landscape and a diverse range of properties
across different structural phases.13 This inherent versatility, combined with boundless pos
sibilities of its combination with hydrogen (H) leads to a plethora of structures and chemical
environments, ranging from simple hydrocarbons like CH4 to complex organic molecules like
carotenes (C40H56).49 The investigation of the hydrocarbons and other CH systems at atom
istic level is crucial for understanding chemical interactions and advancing materials design,
thereby, attracting significant attention from researchers.

Recent advancements in theoretical and computational methodologies, particularly those
based on quantum mechanics (QM), such as density functional theory (DFT)19,20 have sig
nificantly enhanced our ability to study and explore materials at the atomic scale. While
QM methods provide accurate understanding into material behavior, the computational cost
of them increases with the system size,21,22 hindering their applications for exploring exten
sive energy landscapes or largescale simulations. Therefore, we need a tradeoff between
accuracy and computational cost in modeling materials at atomic scale.
