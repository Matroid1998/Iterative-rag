Description:
A compound used in the experimental procedures.

Text:
In continuation of our investigation of novel phenylcyanoacrylate compounds we have prepared 
tbutyl phenylcyanoacrylates, RPhCHC(CN)CO2C(CH3)3, where R is H, 2methyl, 3methyl, 4
methyl, 2ethyl, 4ethyl, 4propyl, 4ipropyl, 4butyl, 4ibutyl, and explored the feasibility of their 
copolymerization with styrene. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on either 
synthesis of these compounds, nor their copolymerization with styrene 18. 2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials 
Benzaldehyde (99), 2methyl (96.5), 3methyl (97), 4methyl (97), 4ethyl (97), 4
propyl (95), 4ipropyl (98), 4butyl (90), 4ibutyl (97) benzaldehydes, tbutyl 
cyanoacetate (98.0), piperidine (99), styrene (99), 1,1azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile) 
(98), (ABCN), and toluene (98) supplied from SigmaAldrich Co., were used as received. 3. Results and discussion
