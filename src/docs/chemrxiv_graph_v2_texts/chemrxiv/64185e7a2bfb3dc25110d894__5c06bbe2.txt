Description:
Forms adducts at ring nitrogen atoms of DNA bases.

A carcinogen is any chemical, physical or biological compound that has the 
potential to induce cancer in living tissues 1. Exposure to carcinogens can be through inhalation, 
ingestion, or absorption into the bodies of multicellular organisms23. Alkylating agents are members of 
a structurally diverse group of DNA damaging compounds which form adducts at ring Nitrogen and 
extracyclic Oxygen atoms of DNA bases 4 NNitrosoNethyl urea (NEU), an ethylating agent has 
been described as a very potent transplacental teratogen and carcinogen in rodents 4 
Human carcinogens could be genotoxic, which means to directly alter the genetic material of target 
cells 3. Other carcinogens are classified as nongenotoxic, in which case are capable of producing 
cancer by some secondary mechanism and not by direct gene damage56.
