Zmatrix templatebased substitution approach 
Three dimensional molecular structures are often represented by a Zmatrix or Cartesian 
40 
coordinates. The two representations can easily be interconverted by freely available software. We 
use Zmatrix for convenience as bond lengths, bond angles and torsional angles, which are natural 
quantities for chemists, can be explicitly laid out. (Cartesian coordinates would be very difficult to 
manipulate using this templatebased substitution method.) As mentioned earlier, templates and 
substitution sites must be identified manually by human. For simplicity, in this article, we use 
45 
hydrogen and halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) as substitutions. The substitution approach can help 
us explore structures of different chemical compositions and structures of identical chemical formula 
(constitutional, configurational and conformational isomers) at the same time.
