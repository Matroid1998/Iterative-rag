Description:
Changes in charge distribution around neighboring nitrogen atoms in hBN lead to room temperature weak ferromagnetism.

Text:
The uorination of electrically insulating
the hBN subsequently modies the electronic band struc
ture to a wide bandgap magnetic semiconductor via the
introduction of defect levels. The electrophilic nature of
uorine causes changes in the charge distribution around
neighboring nitrogen atoms in the hBN, leading to room
temperature weak ferromagnetism30. Very recently, an ex
perimental study shows that exfoliation of the hBN sheets
from bulk material and surface treatment by uorination
makes structural improvements that lead to enhancement in
electrical and optical properties31. Multiple theoretical and experimental investigations
have been conducted to study various features of pure and
passivated the hBN monolayer, what is lacking here is a
meticulous study on the structural, mechanical, and opto
electronic response of uorinated hBN.
