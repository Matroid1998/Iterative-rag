Description:
Chemically distinct polymers used in plastics.

Text:
To meet diverse requirements, plastics exist as many
chemically distinct polymers (e.g., polyamides, polyurethanes, rubbers), for which even plas
tics composed of the same polymer (e.g., polyethylene) can be chemically and materially very
different by their molecular weights, degree of branching, and the inclusion proprietary plas
ticizers, fillers, or dyes.5 The huge volumes produced, the wide range of materials used and
 given that only 20 is recycled (either mechanically, chemically or energetically) and the
rest accumulates in landfills or as pollution on land or in rivers and oceans  plastic pollution
is fastbecoming one of the most significant global issues of our time.6,7
Despite their chemical stability, polymer materials can be mechanically broken down via
abrasive wear, or impact and tensile fractures into ever smaller pieces  microplastics (1 m
 5 mm) (MPs) and nanoplastics (1 nm  1 m) (NPs).8,9 Morphologically, MPs come in a
range of shapes and sizes which is determined by their material, original state and their his
