Description:
Formed via Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative (hetero)arylation of azetidine-containing redox-active ester.

Text:
Our laboratories have been interested in applying different 
strategies towards accessing diversely substituted azetidines for 
medicinal chemistry. For example, in 2022, Pfizer reported on 
the Nicatalyzed decarboxylative (hetero)arylation of the 
azetidinecontaining redoxactive ester to form 2(hetero)aryl
azetidines (Scheme 1).5 In 2023, Enamine developed the 
practical synthesis of 2spirocyclic azetidines employing the 
formal 22cycloaddition between Graf isocyanate and 
exocyclic alkenes (Scheme 1).6 
Here, we present our collaborative studies between Enamine 
and Pfizer aimed at the direct photochemical modifications of 
azetidine2carboxylic acids with alkenes. This reaction has been 
realized in batch and in flow, enabling the preparation of alkyl 
azetidines for medicinal chemistry in mg, g, and even 
multigram quantities. This is the first systematic study on the topic. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2025qmdhg Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
