Description:
Forms complexes with Versatic 10 exhibiting octahedral geometry.

Text:
12, where nickel complexes with Versatic 
10 and a mixture of Cyanex 272 and Versatic 10 exhibited octahedral geometry. It is noteworthy that cobalts coordination geometry can vary, exhibiting octahedral and tetrahedral 
forms, depending on the ligand and oxidation state. While cobalt (II) forms octahedral complexes 
with Versatic 10, it exhibits a preference for tetrahedral coordination with Cyanex 272 and its 
mixtures 14. This flexibility in coordination number is further demonstrated in the formation of 
mixedvalence cobalt complexes, where cobalt (III) adopts octahedral coordination while cobalt 
(II) maintains tetrahedral geometry 15.
