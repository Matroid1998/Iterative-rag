Description:
Involved in reduction systems with analytical quantification of product distribution.

Text:
Materials acceleration platforms (MAPs)4 comprise 
strategies for integrating experiment automation and data science, which hold great promise for 
developing electrocatalysts in general5 and CO2 reduction systems in particular.6 In the ecosystem of 
MAPs for electrocatalyst discovery, a host of techniques have been developed for bulk liquid 
electrolytes,79 including for CO2 reduction with analytical quantification of product distribution.1014 
Driven mostly by fuel cell technologies, high throughput screening has also been demonstrated for 
MEAs.15,16 Building upon these concepts, high throughput screening of GDEs for the electroreduction of 
dinitrogen was demonstrated with a 16channel parallel testing system.17
