Description:
Involved in CH cyanations with unactivated CH bonds.

Text:
Therefore, CH cyanated amines are valuable synthetic 
intermediates, for example for the synthesis of amino ac
ids.1,2 
One general trend in the CH cyanation of amines is that 
anilinetype structures appear to be more reactive,316 pos
sibly due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the func
tionalized CH bond. In comparison, CH cyanations 
of tertiary amines with unactivated (not benzylic or ani
linetype) CH bonds are not as well established. Diverse 
reactivity platforms have been reported to achieve this 
overall transformation. The existing protocols can be elec
trochemically driven,17 photoredoxcatalyzed,1820 Mn and 
Fe catalyzed,21,22 ClO2 driven,23 or photochemical24; they 
also include a nonmetal mediated process employing 
KSCN as cyanation reagent25.

Description:
Undergo CH oxidation catalyzed by Fe with a radical rebound mechanism.

Text:
One common thread in all 
these methods is that they rely on free radical intermedi
ates (Scheme 1AB), which inherently limits their func
tional group tolerance. In an interesting extension of this 
principle, allyl amines can undergo CH cyanation in the 
presence of tBuOOHFeCl2 (typical conditions that allow 
CH cyanation), but then subsequently undergo func
tionalization at the olefin.26
