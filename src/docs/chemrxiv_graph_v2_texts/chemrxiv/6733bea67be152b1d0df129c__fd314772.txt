Description:
Part of the atomic columns within the ZIF8 framework.

Text:
Electron dose rate or electron flux density 
is the rate at which electrons pass through a given area, typically measured in electrons per square angstrom 
per second (e2s1). The cumulative electron dose up to which the structural integrity of ZIF8 is 
maintained for various lattice (Bragg) planes is referred to as the critical dose. Zhu et al. preserved the structural integrity of ZIF8 during the experiment by capturing TEM images on a 
direct detection electron counting (DDEC) camera using an exceptionally low dose of 4.1 e2 8. The 
resulting image conveyed structural details up to 2.1 , enabling the resolution of individual atomic 
columns within the Zn and imidazole linkers of the framework. Notably, they observed that ZIF8
