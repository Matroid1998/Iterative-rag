Description:
Small polar groups that mimic the spatial electronic properties of common functional groups and enhance binding through polarity and H-bonding properties.

Precise control of molecular properties and conformation 
is essential in drug discovery.1 Effective interactions with 
targeted biological sites require complementary electron 
density surfaces, modulated through combinations of polar, 
aromatic and hydrophobic sites. Small polar groups such as 
oxetanes,2 sulfoximines3 and phosphine oxides4 have 
emerged as valuable bioisosteres that mimic the spatial 
electronic properties of more common functional groups 
and potentially enhance binding through tailoring polarity 
and Hbonding properties. These groups are also beneficial 
in providing increased 3dimensionality and in influencing 
metabolic stability, solubility, absorption, distribution and 
pKa. Thus, these small polar motifs have provided genuine 
new design options to medicinal chemists.
