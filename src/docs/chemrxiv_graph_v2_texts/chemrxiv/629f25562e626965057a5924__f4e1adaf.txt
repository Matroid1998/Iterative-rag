Description:
Has a nominal kinetic diameter of 3.60 Å and diffuses extremely slowly into pores of width 4 Å at -196°C in biochars.

Text:
This lower limit to the
socalled pore size range is not necessarily solely determined by
the size of the molecule; for example while N2 has a nominal ki
netic diameter (dk) of 3.60  , it has been observed that at 196 C
in biochars this molecule diffuses extremely slowly into pores of
width 4  .2224 On the other hand, adsorption can be improved
by optimising the interactions between parallel pore walls and ad
sorptive molecules. That is, when the distance between pore walls
is sufficiently small adsorbed molecules are affected by physical
attraction to both walls, which increases the heat of adsorption
and thus the retention of molecules within the pores.25,26 This
