Lithiumion batteries have become the leading technology to make the worldwide adoption of electric 
vehicles (EVs) realized due to their high voltage, high energy density, and long cycle life. To attain further 
gains in energy density, Nirich, LiNi1xTMxO2 (TM  transition metal, x  0.2), cathode materials have 
been developed. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (LiNCA) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (LiNMC811) offer a high 
reversible capacity around 200 mAh g1 at relatively low cost.1 Unfortunately, these cathode compositions 
suffer from poor thermal stability from oxygen release at highly delithiated states.24 Oxygen release at 
the cathode surface form impeding surface layers, inhibiting Liion diffusion, which is further aggravated 
by microcrack evolution.
