Description:
Complexes with nitrogen coordinating ligands that exhibit significant structural differences between high-spin and low-spin states, enhancing switching properties in molecular memory devices.

. Spin crossover (SCO) complexes13 exhibit a change in spin state from lowspin (LS) to 
highspin (HS) or vice versa, as a function of external stimuli4 like temperature5,6, pressure1,58, or 
light7,912. These complexes find a variety of applications13 in molecular spintronics14, memory 
devices15, sensors16, optical devices17, and displays18. Fe(II) SCO complexes with nitrogen
coordinating ligands are studied extensively19 since they exhibit greatest structural differences 
between HS and LS states,2025 allowing for clear distinction between the two spin states and 
leading to better switching properties in molecular memory devices. A multitude of experimental 
techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements,2628 Mssbauer spectroscopy,2628

IR2931 
and 
NMR,3133 
UVVis,3234 
Raman,30,31,35 
and 
Xray 
crystallography,2628 are employed to characterize SCO behavior.
