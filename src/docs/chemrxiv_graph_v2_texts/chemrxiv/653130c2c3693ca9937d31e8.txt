Description:
Binds covalently to the cofactor FAD and inhibits enzymes irreversibly.

Text:
TCP binds covalently to the cofactor FAD and thus inhibits these 
enzymes irreversibly.13 Starting from this, numerous potent and selective inhibitors with low 
nanomolar IC50 values against LSD1 on the basis of TCP have been developed.1415 However, 
although clinical studies have been pursued, limits for these clinical candidates have emerged The 
nanomolar inhibitor ORY1001, currently in clinical phase IIa for the treatment of AML and 
SCLC, manifests toxicities such as thrombocytopenia and neutropenia which are doselimiting 
sideeffects. A second example is the inhibitor GSK2879552, where studies needed to be stopped 
due to an unfavorable riskbenefit ratio (NCT02034123; NCT02177812). httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2022n11dqv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000263617716 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
