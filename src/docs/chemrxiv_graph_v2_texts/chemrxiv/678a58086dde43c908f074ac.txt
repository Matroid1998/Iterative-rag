Description:
A product of the biodegradation of PEGs by microorganisms.

Text:
The 
latter may also receive indirect inputs when fertilized with PEGcontaining sludge.5 
Despite these release pathways into natural and engineered systems, the environmental 
chemistry and fate of PEGs  as well as of WSPs in general  remains poorly studied and 
understood.6,7 Besides transport and mobility considerations,8,9 transformation processes, such 
as extracellular chainscission reactions, are of particular relevance. Biodegradation, a process 
in which microorganisms take up and metabolically convert PEGs into CO2 and microbial bi
omass, can be considered the ultimate transformation endpoint.

Description:
Produced from the metabolism of glyoxylates.

Text:
Previous studies have proposed 
that this microbial utilization of PEGs occurs through endgroup specific (i.e., exolytic) oxida
tion reactions catalyzed by three intracellular enzymes an alcohol dehydrogenase, which con
verts the terminal alcohols into aldehydes; an aldehyde dehydrogenase, which oxidizes the al
dehydes to carboxylic acids; and, finally, an ether bondcleaving enzyme (e.g., ahydroxy acid 
dehydrogenase), which acts on the carboxylic end groups releasing glyoxylates, thereby short
ening the PEG chain by one unit.1014 The glyoxylates are then further metabolized to CO2.
