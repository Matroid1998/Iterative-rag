Description:
A prototypical phosphine used to explore the ligand sphere.

Especially, soft and strongly ligating phosphines are the donor atoms of choice.9 The early work 
30 
by Reppe established triphenylphosphine as prototypical phosphine and initiated the exploration 
31 
of the ligand sphere, crafting the microenvironment of the metal center.10,11 A remarkable example 
32 
of this design process is Xantphos, a bidentate phosphine ligand with a rigid backbone and a wide 
33 
bite angle, which has been addressed by recent reviews.1113 While Xantphos was originally 
34 
applied for hydroformylation catalysis14, its superior properties as ligand also occur in 
35 
hydrocyanation15, crosscoupling reactions16 and CH activation reactions forming CC and CX 
36 
bonds17.
