Description:
A silvery metal with a body-centered cubic structure at 1 atm, highly reactive with air due to its low ionization energy.

Text:
At 1 atmosphere (atm), sodium assumes a bodycenteredcubic (bcc) structure, and it ap
pears as a silvery metal that is easy to cut with a knife and is highly reactive with air, due
to its very low ionization energy.1 Squeezing sodium to 120 GPa (about 1.2 million atm)
decreases its melting point by a dramatic 700 K2  in sharp contrast to the melting point
increase expected for bonds that strength under pressure.

Description:
Exhibits rich structural diversity with multiple crystalline phases near its melting point.

Text:
Seven different crystalline phases,
some with extremely complex structures, have been observed at pressure and temperature
conditions near sodiums melting point minimum, highlighting sodiums rich structural di
versity and complicated potential energy landscape.3
Even more striking is sodiums behavior near 200 GPa, when it becomes transparent to
visible light.4 Transparency in materials indicates the opening of a bandgap, meaning the
valence electrons in the highest occupied crystalline orbital can no longer move freely in the
conduction bands as they do in a metal,5 and indeed this highpressure phase of sodium is
an insulator with a bandgap calculated to exceed 1.3 eV.4 As will be described in detail
below, this behavior stems from the way in which pressure affects the electronic structure
of atoms.

Description:
Possesses a 3s1 valence configuration at 1 atm and undergoes electronic state reorganization under high pressure.

Text:
While at 1 atm sodium possesses a 3s1 valence configuration, under highpressure
the energies associated with its s, p and d electronic states are reorganized
(Figure 1),
so that projecting sodiums valence bands onto atomic orbitals reveals a high degree of p
and d mixing with the broad sbased bands. It is this energetic reordering of the orbitals
that changes the chemical bonding, crystalline structure, and properties of this prototypical
1 atm nearlyfreeelectron metal.6,7
Sodiums behavior is not unique; all elements undergo some modification of their elec
tronic structure under pressure.8,9 Hydrogen, stable as a diatomic molecule at ambient condi
