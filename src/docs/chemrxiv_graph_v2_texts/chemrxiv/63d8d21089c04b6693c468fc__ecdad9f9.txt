Description:
Included in the class of isoporphyrinoids.

Text:
They are characterized by one ore more saturated meso carbons, which interrupt or 
greatly diminish the global aromaticity of the macrocycle.3,4 Today, the isoporphyrinoids also include (in 
addition to isoporphyrins5,6) phlorins,7,8 porphyrinogens,9,10 calixpyrroles,11 calixphyrins,12,13 and 
isocorroles14,15 as well as their expanded16,17 and Nconfused derivatives.18,19 The macrocycles are of 
interest for a variety of reasons, obviously as novel transition metal ligands,20,21 but also as platforms for 
NIR dyes,22 molecular recognition23 (especially anion sensing24,25), and drug delivery.26 Herein, we wish 
to disclose the serendipitous discovery of new isoporphyrinoid  calixcorrole  the corrole analogue of 
calixphyrin. Figure 1. Synthesis of pyrroleappended isocorrole and calixcorrole. 3
