Description:
Forms carbon nanotubes, which are used as recognition elements in gas sensors.

Text:
Gas sensors are useful for monitoring chemical processes 1, air quality 2,3, automotive emissions
4, food quality 5, agricultural greenhouses 6, and human health 7 and detecting safety and
security threats (e.g. explosives, nerve agents) 8. For the Internet of Things 9, gas sensors
will play a vital role in diverse contexts, ranging from agriculture to human tness 10. A solidstate gas sensor functions by its recognition element exhibiting changes in a given property
in response to changes in the concentration of an analyte in the gas phase. Common examples
of recognition elements are metal oxides 11, polymers 12, carbon nanotubes 13, and metal
organic frameworks 14.
