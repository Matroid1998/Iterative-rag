Nanozymes are a huge group of nanomaterials such as carbon nanomaterials, metal
based nanoparticles, metal oxides, metalorganic frameworks, and nanoclusters that 
exhibit intrinsic enzymelike activity 112. Among different nanozymes, most of them 
reveal significant peroxidaselike activity and cleavage of the peroxide bonds to produce 
active oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals 1318. The produced radicals can then 
react with chromogenic substrates and oxidize them to their corresponding colored 
products. The spectrophotometric assay and recording of the absorbance of these 
products can be used as an index for calculating the nanozymatic activity of the nanoscale 
peroxidaselike materials 1925.
