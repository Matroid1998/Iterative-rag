Description:
Nanoparticles exhibit strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared range of the solar spectrum.

Noble metals with nanoscopic dimensions (nanostructures) strongly 
interact with and hence harvest the incident light, thanks to their surface plasmon properties.13 
As a result, energetic charge carriers (hot electrons and holes), and a high local temperature are 
generated, offering new perspectives of lightdriven chemistry, known as plasmonic chemistry.4,5 
Plasmonic nanocatalysis was shown to initiate novel reaction pathways described either via the 
generation of hot charge carriers or by a thermallyinduced mechanism.69The dimerization of 4
nitrothiophenol and 4aminothiophenol have been considered as the first examples of plasmonic 
chemistry, followed by other reactions that are driven by plasmonic effects.1015 
Plasmonic nanostructures made from gold, silver and copper nanoparticles exhibit a strong 
absorption in the visible and nearinfrared range of the solar spectrum, unlike the traditional 
semiconductors that catalyze chemical reactions only with the high energetic UV light.1618 
Importantly, the optical properties of the plasmonic nanoparticles are largely dependent on their 
shape and size, which can be effectively tuned to capture specific photon energies.
