Description:
Show remarkable self-assembly characteristics in both solution and on surfaces, dependent on their ring size and level of functionalisation.

Importantly, the dynamic equilibrium 
of hostguest complex formation, as observed in solution, is 
shifted significantly in favour of the hostguest complexes when 
the host is bound to a surface, which results in a more stable 
binding than expected from homogeneous experiments.12,13 
Pillararenes show remarkable selfassembly characteristics in 
both solution and on surfaces, directly dependent on their ring 
size and level of functionalisation.17 Huang and coworkers 
pioneered 
surfacemodification 
with 
pillararenes 
when 
investigating functionalised gold particles for their hostguest 
complexation behaviours as well as their ability to function as 
reaction cavities.18,19 In a subsequent development, Inagi and co
workers demonstrated the electrochemically induced oxidative 
generation 
of 
micronsized 
hexagonal 
cylinders 
from 
pillar6arene (PA6) on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes.20 
PA6 are highly symmetric, hexagonally shaped macrocycles 
composed of six methylenebridged 1,4diphenol units, with the 
bridging units para to each other.11 With a cavity size of 
approximately 6.7 , they accommodate suitable guest species 
through hydrophobic, van der Waals, CH or  interactions.
