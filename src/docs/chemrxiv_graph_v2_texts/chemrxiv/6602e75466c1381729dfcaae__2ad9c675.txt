Description:
Resides in small channels within the Ge framework of Na1xGe3z.

Text:
A typical example is the 
binary Na1xGe3z, prepared by thermal decomposition of Na4Ge4 and, it comprises a covalently 
bonded, zeolitelike Ge framework, in which Na atoms and also additional Ge atoms reside in 
small and broad channels formed by the framework, respectively. 11 But here again, some Ge 
atoms are disordered at the middle of the broad channel, and the nature of their interactions with 
their coordination sphere is unclear. Furthermore, the formation of new modifications of silicon 
(alloSi) and germanium (alloGe) from oxidative removal of alkali metal from Li3NaSi6 and 
Li7Ge12 respectively, 12 as well as the formation of nanostructured materials 78 and novel 
allotrope of germanium using the Zintl phases Na4Ge9 or Mg2Ge as precursors have been 
reported.

Description:
Transfers charge to Sn, allowing Sn anions to achieve the octet as isolated species on the Na-rich side.

Meanwhile, the exploration of the NaSn system revealed the astonishing structural variety of 
the compounds with opened tin frameworks, acknowledging the versatility of the SnSn bond. 13 Depending on the atomic ratio NaSn, the dimensionality of the tin network in binary phases 
can vary from zero to threedimensional (0 to 3D), and the SnSn bonding ranges from 
localized twocentertwoelectron (2c2e) bonds to purely metallic bond. On the Narich side, 
the charge transfer from Na to Sn is often enough to allow the Sn anions to achieve the octet as 
isolated species. But in the Snrich side, the Sn atoms are forced to form bonds to each other, 
resulting in polyanionic tin subunits with opened frameworks having various connectivity and 
bond types.
