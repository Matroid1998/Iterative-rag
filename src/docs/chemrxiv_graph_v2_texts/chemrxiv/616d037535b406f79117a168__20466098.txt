Description:
Contains a more reactive norbornene alkene that reacts with sulfur to form oligomers.

Text:
Fully crosslinked copolymers made from sulfur and DCPD have 
useful properties such as high hardness and modulus, and solvent 
resistance.6, 7 These properties would be advantageous for coating 
applications, but the insolubility of these crosslinked polymers makes 
processing difficult. Here, we present a robust process for 
overcoming the intractability of the target copolymer. First, sulfur is reacted with the more reactive norbornene alkene8 
of DCPD to provide linear, solution processible oligomers (1). The 
oligomers are shelf stable and can be easily coated onto diverse 
substrates. Upon curing, in situ SS metathesis as well as addition to 
the cyclopentenyl alkene provides the crosslinked polymer coating.
