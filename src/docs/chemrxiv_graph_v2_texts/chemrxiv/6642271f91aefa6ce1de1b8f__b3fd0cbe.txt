Text:
Caffeine a legal psychoactive and representative purine alkaloid found in the leaves of the 
Coffea arabica 1 form xanthine and uric acid metabolites in the body with only 3 of caffeine 
being excreted unchanged.2 These diverse caffeine metabolites enter the water environment 
and have implications for ecopharmacovigilance.3 Although the electrochemical behaviour of 
caffeine has been studied for uses including as sensors and determination of caffeine 
concentration, 45 to the best of our knowledge no structure electroactivity relationships 
(SeAR) of metabolite formation nor single step synthesis of major caffeine metabolites  
paraxanthine and theophylline have been developed. The primary human metabolism of caffeine (Scheme 1) proceeds predominantly through N3
demethylation to paraxanthine via CYP1A2 in the liver (7080 of metabolites). 3,6,7.

Description:
Undergoes C8 oxidation to form 1,3,7 trimethyluric acids.

Text:
Secondary metabolic pathways proceed via C8oxidation of caffeine to afford 1,3,7
trimethyluric acids (15 of metabolites).8 Tertiary metabolic pathways are via demethylation 
at the N1position of caffeine to theobromine and N7position to theophylline (both account for 
78 of metabolites).8. Furthermore, minor metabolites of caffeine include 1methylxanthine 
(1X), 1methyluric acid (1U), 5acetylamino6formylamino3methyluracil (AFMU), and 1,7
