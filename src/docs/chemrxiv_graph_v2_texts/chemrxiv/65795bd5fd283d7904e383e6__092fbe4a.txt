Description:
A TADF compound used as a temperature sensor.

Text:
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are a class of emissive compounds 
that have small singlettriplet excited state energy gaps (DEST).1921 They have garnered much 
attention due to their capacity to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light in 
electroluminescent devices such as organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs).20,21 They have 
increasingly been used in other applications, most notably as photocatalysts and as bioimaging 
reagents.2224 However, very few reports exist documenting the use of organic TADF materials 
as sensors.2527 The first reported example employed a TADF compound, acridine yellow (Figure 
1a), as a temperature sensor.28 Steinegger et al.
