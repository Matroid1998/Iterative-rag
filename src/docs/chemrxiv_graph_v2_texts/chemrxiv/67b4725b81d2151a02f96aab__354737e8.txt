Description:
Exhibits size or composition-dependent luminescence properties, magnetic behavior, and catalytic activity.

of two types of 
ligandschelating ligands that coordinate to the Au13 cluster surface and endcapping ligands that suppress 
polymerizationenabled the synthesis of a building block molecule which are programmed to selectively and spontaneously 
form Au13based dimers upon the addition of metal ions. The designed building block clusters indeed selectively and 
efficiently formed stable dimers composed of two Au13 clusters in the presence of iron ions. Furthermore, in the Au13based 
dimer, the phosphorescent Au13 moiety is directly connected to a coordination site that exhibits quenching effects, enabling 
rapid intramolecular photoinduced charge transfer even with a small driving force. Introduction 
Ligandprotected metal clusters, which consist of a finite number of 
noble metal atoms (such as gold and silver), exhibit size or 
compositiondependent 
luminescence 
properties, 
magnetic 
behavior, and catalytic activity.
