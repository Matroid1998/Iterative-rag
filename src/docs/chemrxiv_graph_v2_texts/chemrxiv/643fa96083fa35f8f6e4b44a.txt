Description:
When combined with palladium, forms a catalyst.

Invented by Avnir in 2002,1 molecularly doped metals found 
their first application in catalysis in 2005 when BeharLevy and 
Avnir reported that the Nafion polymer entrapped within Ag 
(NafionAg) 
readily 
mediates the 
pinacolpinacolone 
rearrangement and the dehydration of 2phenylethanol to 
styrene with high yield (80 and 90, respectively).2 In the 
subsequent two decades the research field of metalorganic 
alloys (MORALs)3 continued to grow, though at a lower rate 
than one would expect from the scope and possibilities opened 
by these new class of materials merging the properties of metals 
with those of organic molecules.4,5 
Ranging from goldentrapped enzymes6 through palladium
entrapped graphene oxide,7 however, MORALs are active and 
selective catalysts in a number of reactions of relevance to both 
major segments of the chemical industry, wherein bulk and fine 
chemicals in nearly each case are produced through catalyzed 
chemical reactions.
