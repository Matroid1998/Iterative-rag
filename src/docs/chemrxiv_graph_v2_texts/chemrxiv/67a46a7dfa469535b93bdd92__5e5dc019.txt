Description:
Involved in rearrangements through skeletal realignment of anionic intermediates.

These ring contraction and ring expansion reactions offer 
the great advantage over for example cyclizations in that they do not pose stringent limitation 
regarding ring sizes.14 Furthermore, the contractionextension approach allows for the easy 
conversion of readily available or abundant cyclic precursors to yield more complex, valueadded 
products.57 Traditional ring contraction reactions often proceed through the migration of bonds to 
electrondecient intermediates, including WagnerMeerwein,8,9 (semi)pinacol,10 and Wolff 
rearrangements,11 or through skeletal realignment of anionic intermediates such as in Favorskii,12,13 
and benzilic acid rearrangements.14 Other types of ring contractions operate through extrusion of 
small molecules as exemplied in RambergBcklund olenations (loss of SO2),1518 the 
decomposition of diazenes (loss of N2),1922 or photochemical decarbonylations (loss of CO).2326 
But ring contraction reactions are not entirely limited to the synthetic chemistry world and also 
Nature does occasionally take advantage of similar transformations in the biosynthesis of complex 
metabolites.
