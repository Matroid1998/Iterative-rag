Description:
Units that stabilize the diradical state, leading to magnetic bistability at room temperature.

In a 
subsequent optimization of Kubos system, Feringa and co
workers introduced additional steric bulk in the fjord
region and thiaxanthylidene units that stabilize the 
diradical state, which eventually lead to absolute magnetic 
bistability at room temperature. However, the stabilization 
of spin states states that is dominantly based on 
conformational changes could be a conceptual limitation for 
the future demand of tuned bistability of molecular 
magnetic switches. Hence, switching mechanisms based on 
photochemical reactions that involve the making and 
breaking of chemical bonds is a motivating alternative 
concept to achieve amplified bistability among the magnetic 
states.
