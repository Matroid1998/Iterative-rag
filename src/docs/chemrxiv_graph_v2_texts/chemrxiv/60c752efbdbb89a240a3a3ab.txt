Description:
High concentrations can be expected in coastal wastewater treatment plants due to seawater intrusions.

The last decades saw a great development in the amount of wastewater treated. In Europe, 
32 
95 of the households were connected to a collection system in 2014, representing 517 
33 
million people (European commission 2017). China bears the worlds largest municipal 
34 
wastewater infrastructure, and over 90 of the country wastewater was treated in 2018 (86). 35 
The wastewater composition can vary strongly depending on the location of the wastewater 
36 
treatment plant (WWTP) and the type of influent streams. For instance, high concentrations 
37 
of SO42, Na and Cl can be expected in coastal WWTPs, where seawater intrusions can occur 
38 
(87).
