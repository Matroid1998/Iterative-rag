Description:
An important element that can induce novel and complementary properties due to its isoelectronic relationship with carbon.

Chemically doping heteroatoms into aromatic compounds has 
proven to be one of the most effective methods to tune their 
optoelectronic properties and intermolecular interactions.1 
Due to the isoelectronic relationship between boron and carbon 
cation as well as between boronnitrogen (BN) unit and two 
carbon atoms (CC) motif, boron becomes an important element 
that can induce novel and complementary properties.2 BN
doped aromatic compounds have a long history of evolution 
since the first example of BNarene was reported by Alfred 
Stock in 1926.3 Much the same to many other topics of 
chemistry, not much attention was paid until the new 
millennium.

Description:
When positioned in PAHs with nitrogen, it contributes to thermally activated delayed fluorescence with narrow emission FWHM.

Nowadays, the synthesis of BNdoped arenes has 
become one of the most popular topics in organic chemistry and 
material chemistry, and numerous new BNdoped aromatic 
compounds have been synthesized and demonstrated to have 
very 
distinct 
properties 
in 
optoelectronic 
materials.4 
Representative applications of Bdoped polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been demonstrated in organic field
effect transistor (OFETs)5 and organic light emitting diodes 
(OLEDs).6 Particularly, since PAHs decorated by parapositioned 
boron and nitrogen atoms has been reported to show thermally 
activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with narrow fullwidth at 
halfmaximum (FWHM) of emission based on efficient HOMO
LUMO separation by the multiple resonance effect in 2016,6a 
BNdoped PAHs have been extensively studied for next
generation OLEDs.

Description:
The coordination number of boron atom shows noteworthy impact on photophysical properties.

In addition, the majority of previous attention has been paid 
to the tricoordinate boron units in PAHs,10 tetracoordinate 
boron has been viewed more as a functional group instead of a 
dopant.11 In fact, the coordination number of boron atom 
shows noteworthy impact on the photophysical properties. Until recently, effort to replace the threecoordinate boron of 
BN unit with fourcoordinate boron has been made (Scheme 1a). The formationdissociation of fourcoordinate boron unit 
through a dynamic BN coordination bond in BPAHs (A)12 has 
been exploited for the solutionprocessed fabrication of 
semiconducting films of poorly soluble BPAHs. Hatakeyama et 
al reported that tetracoordinate boronfused helicenes (B)13 as
