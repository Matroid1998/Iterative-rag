Description:
Derivative of hemiindigo that does not undergo photoisomerization due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT).

Text:
Earlier studies had shown that incorporation of a pyrrolic ring can ener
getically favor the otherwise metastable E isomer owing to formation of an intramolecular 
hydrogen bond. 21,22 Furthermore, while hemiindigo recently regained interest as potential 
photoswitch,23 its pyridyl derivative was found to not undergo photoisomerization,21,22 which 
is likely due to excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) as has been demonstrated 
for indigo.24 Likewise, for the E isomer of some structurally related indolecontaining hemi
thioindigo derivatives, which are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding,25,26 EZ 
photoisomerization was inhibited, which was also ascribed to ESIPT.27 Based on these findings, 
we hypothesized first that protonation of Nheterocyclic hemiindigo would induce thermal 
isomerization over the double bond by disruption and (re)formation of a stabilizing intramol
