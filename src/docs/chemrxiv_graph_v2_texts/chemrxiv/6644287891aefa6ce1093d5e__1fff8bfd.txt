Description:
A material used as a surface for interfacial Li ion transfer studies, particularly in its highly oriented pyrolytic form.

Text:
The Li ion energetics is governed by the local molecular environments of Li ions, 
which are dependent on the composition and the concentration of the electrolyte, and the electrode 
facets and potential.6 Here, we focus on the adsorption of Li ions at the electrified interface from 
the bulk electrolyte as its molecular processes and energetics are poorly understood but essential 
to control the intercalationdeintercalation kinetics.9,16 
Few experimental investigations1725 and computational studies8,9,26,27 have attempted to obtain an 
understanding of the Li ion adsorption process, which includes its dependence on various factors 
such as the electric double layer (EDL) structure,16 cationanion and cationsolvent dissociation 
energies,28 and solvation environments.29 Using AC impedance spectroscopy, Yamada et al.17 
showed that the activation energy of the interfacial Li ion transfer on a highly oriented pyrolytic 
graphite surface is proportional to the solvation energy of Li ions, which is a proxy for the energy 
required for the desolvation of Li ions from the solvent molecules.

Description:
A material into which Li ions are adsorbed from the electrolyte.

In another study, using Raman 
spectroscopy and AC impedance spectroscopy, Uchida et al.30 reported that increasing the 
association between Li ions and anions in the electrolyte reduces the activation energy for Li ion 
adsorption from the electrolyte into the graphite. Using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics
