remarkable combination of high theoretical energy density, costeffectiveness, and the 
5 
widespread availability of sulfur, LiS batteries stand out as a promising contender for the next 
6 
generation of energy storage solutions.14 The theoretical energy density of LiS batteries have a 
7 
fivefold increase compared to that of conventional LIBs, positioning them as an optimal choice 
8 
for both electric vehicles and gridscale energy storage applications.5 The exceptional energy 
9 
density of LiS batteries is predominantly attributed to sulfur serving as the cathode active 
10 
material, boasting a theoretical capacity of 1675 mAhgsulfur, significantly surpassing traditional 
11 
cathode materials like cobalt, nickel, and manganese oxides used in LIBs.5 Furthermore, sulfurs 
12 
nontoxic nature and abundant supply make it an attractive and sustainable choice for energy 
13 
storage applications.1, 6 In essence, the remarkable energy density inherent in LiS batteries 
14 
confers practical viability to their integration into energy storage systems.

Meanwhile, their 
15 
abundant natural availability concurrently establishes a resilient basis for the expansive 
16 
commercialization prospects of LiS batteries on a large scale.1, 2 
17 
Despite the substantial merits offered by LiS batteries in terms of their elevated 
18 
theoretical energy density and costeffectiveness, the realization of their commercial potential 
19 
necessitates the resolution of formidable technical challenges. These challenges encompass the 
20 
low conductivity of elemental sulfur, parasitic reactions on the anode, and the volume expansions 
21 
during lithiation and delithiation processes.1, 2, 7, 8 Within this spectrum, two primary concerns 
22 
have been scrutinized extensively within the domains of chemistry and electrochemistry. Firstly,
