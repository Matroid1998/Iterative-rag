Description:
Oxidizes to Ni4 at an average potential of 4.7 V vs. LiLi.

Spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) is one of the most promising and 
costeffective candidates for nextgeneration positive electrode 
materials for Liion batteries. This material offers a high capacity 
of 147 mAh.g1 due to the oxidation of Ni2 to Ni4 at an average 
potential of 4.7 V vs. LiLi, which results in an appealing energy 
density of 650 Whkg.1,2 However, some issues still prevent its im
plementation in commercial devices. Limited stability of electro
lytes at such high potentials leads to secondary reactions at the elec
trodeelectrolyte interface involving Mn dissolution into the elec
trolyte and cathode electrolyte interphase growth.3 A deep compre
hension and adjustment of its intrinsic properties are necessary to 
make LNMObased batteries available.
