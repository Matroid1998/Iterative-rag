Description:
An inert noble gas used as a filler gas for lamps, insulation in multiple-pane windows, gain medium for lasers, and as a protective gas during the production of metals and semiconductors.

Text:
The inert, noble gases xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), and argon (Ar) have several industrial applications,
such as ller gas for lamps (Xe, Kr, Ar), insulation in multiplepane windows (Xe, Kr, Ar), anaesthetic
and imaging agent in medicine (Xe), propellant for ion thrusters on spacecraft (Xe), gain medium for
lasers (Xe, Kr, Ar), and medium to detect and measure ionizing radiation (Ar, Xe). Ar is used in bulk
quantities, as a protective gas, during the production of metals and semiconductors. 1,2
Xe, Kr, and Ar naturally occur in the atmosphere of the earth at 0.0000086 mol , 0.000114 mol , and
0.9300 mol , respectively (troposphere, dry conditions) 1.
