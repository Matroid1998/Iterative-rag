Description:
A trivalent ion whose adsorption on proteins is strongly pH dependent.

Text:
Nevertheless, trivalent 
ions are known to play a central role in proteins and colloidal reactivity, being held responsible 
for crystallization phenomena, phase separation and surface charge reversion.2830 For 
example, the adsorption of Fe3 and La3 on bacterial and bovine serum albumin proteins was 
revealed to be strongly pH dependent at micromolar concentrations,31, 32 and caused a 
charge reversion of lipid surfaces starting from submicromolar LaCl3 concentrations.33, 34 
The complexation of trivalent ions La3 and Fe3 to the specific carboxylic acid of a fatty 
acid monolayer has been probed by Xray reflectivity, Xray fluorescence, and more recently 
VSFS.3538 Specific ion effects were observed, in which it was concluded that La3 
adsorption to the carboxylic acid was led only by Coulombic interactions.
