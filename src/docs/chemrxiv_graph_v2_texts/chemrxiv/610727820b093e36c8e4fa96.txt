Description:
Found in the earth's crust at approximately 0.5 parts per million as elemental mercury or as a sulfide.

Text:
Mercury (Hg) is found in the earths crust at approximately 0.5 parts per million (ppm) as 
35 
elemental mercury or as a sulfide.1 Outgassing from rock, volcanic activity, coal burning, and mining 
can release mercury into the atmosphere. Additionally, mercury can be introduced to marine 
ecosystems as a result of industrial runoff or discharge, such as in the events that occurred in 
Minamata Bay, Japan, in the 1950s and in commercial gold mining operations.24 As elemental or 
inorganic mercury enters the water cycle, it is converted into an organic compound, such as 
40 
methylmercury, by microorganisms.5 Once these microorganisms are consumed by smaller creatures 
and eventually by larger fish near or at the top trophic levels (e.g., tuna, swordfish, or shark, etc.

Description:
Can accumulate in the body leading to adverse health effects including neurological and behavioral disorders.

), 
mercury concentration in the tissue can climb to significant levels.1 Human consumption of these 
contaminated marine species can lead to accumulation of mercury in the body and result in adverse 
health effects, including neurological and behavioral disorders, neuromuscular effects, headaches, 
45 
cognitive and motor dysfunction, kidney damage, and potentially death.6 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely monitors Hg levels in commercial fish, provides 
guidelines on fish consumption, and prohibits the sale of fish that have methylmercury levels higher 
than an action level of 1 ppm.710 Action levels represent the limit at which FDA will take legal action
