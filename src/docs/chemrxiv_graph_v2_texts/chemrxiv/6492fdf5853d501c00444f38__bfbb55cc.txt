A well-known sesquiterpene lactone identified in wild lettuce.

sativum) typically contain around 3  of secondary 
metabolites by weight.11 Such compounds are mainly phenolic and 
polyphenolic compounds, sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) and 
flavonoids (to a lesser extent).11 
For the purposes of this work, we focused on the sesquiterpene 
lactones found in the root of industrial chicory. Around fifteen STLs 
belonging to the guaianolide subfamily have been identified, with 
lactucin (Lc) and its ester analog lactucopicrin (Lp) being the most 
wellknown, as they were previously identified in wild lettuce 
(Lactuca virosa).12,13 Within the root of industrial chicory, these STLs 
predominantly exist as conjugated oxalate and glucoside derivatives. 14 The previous STLs, along with their respective saturated analogs, 
11,13dihydrolactucin and 11,13dihydrolactucopicrin, can also be 
found in the root.

Description:
Has antiparasitic properties against Plasmodium falciparum and is linked to antiadipogenesis effects and anticancer activities.

dihydrolactucin (DHLc) and lactucopicrin (DHLp) effectively inhibited 
the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DHLp was also effective 
against Staphylococcus aureus, while DHLc showed good results 
against different strains of Candida.23 Antiparasitic properties were 
reported for STLs from chicory such as lactucin and lactucopicrin, 
notably against Plasmodium falciparum strain Honduras1.24,25 
Moreover, lactucin has also been linked to both in vivo and in vitro 
antiadipogenesis effects and anticancer activities.26,27
