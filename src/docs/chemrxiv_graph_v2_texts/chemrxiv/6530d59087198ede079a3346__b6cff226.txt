Description:
A class of solid, porous materials considered for CO2 capture.

Climate change, which is an undeniable concern that poses a major risk to humanity and ecological 
systems alike, stems from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that originate from an assortment of 
anthropogenic activities, like electricity production.12 Of the GHGs that are emitted into the air, it is 
estimated that CO2 alone accounts for 76, making carbon capture from large point sources an urgent 
need.3 To date, the most mature capture technology consists of aqueous liquid amine scrubbers.4 While 
these solutions can readily extract large amounts of CO2 from gas mixtures, liquid amines are also 
corrosive, suffer from high regeneration energies, and often degrade over time.45 These shortfalls, 
combined with the high heat capacity of these liquids,6 leads to a large energy penalty with their 
implementation.4 In fact, it was estimated that the implementation of liquid amine capture could decrease 
the efficiency of a power plant by as much as 30.4 Given this, increasing numbers of studies are aimed 
at designing CO2 selective solid adsorbents, an effort which might cut the parasitic energy cost by as much 
as 50.5 
Of the many possible classes of solid, porous materials to choose from for CO2 capture, such as activated 
carbons,7 zeolites,8 silicas,9 MOFs, and COFs.10 MOFs have maintained a position at the forefront of 
such studies, owed to their highly crystalline nature, tunable structures, and record porosity.1113 
Unfortunately, many MOFs suffer from issues, such as low CO2 capacity and selectivity, particularly in 
the presence of humidity,1415 and short lifetime.
