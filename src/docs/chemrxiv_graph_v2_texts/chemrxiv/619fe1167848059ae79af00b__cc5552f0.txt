Description:
A cathode material with a capacity of 240 mAhg.

Text:
suggested that the capacity 
could be even higher due to incorporation of more than three Li.4 The use of such materials, 
is thus an attractive replacement for existing, lower capacity cathodes such as LiCoO2 (240 
mAhg) and LiNixCoyMn1xyO2 (280 mAhg).5 Progress in this field requires an atomicscale 
understanding of structural changes such as conversion, insertion, etc of the cathode that occur 
during Li ion intercalation and deintercalation. Furthermore, defining the sites that act as 
either host(s) for ion insertion and extraction, or facilitate the process, can be crucial to 
optimising performance of the material.
