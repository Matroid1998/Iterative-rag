Description:
Analogous to Zr in stability under harsh thermal and chemical environments.

The controlled assembly of metal centres and multitopic organic linkers has been used 
to great effect in the synthesis of metalorganic nanosheets (MONs) as a versatile 
class of twodimensional (2D) materials.1,2 In contrast to other 2D materials, MONs 
possess readily tuneable surfaces with high external surface area and greater 
concentration of accessible active sites which makes them ideal candidates for 
applications in the fields of catalysis, sensing, optoelectronics, and separation.35 In 
particular, Zrbased MONs (and their Hf analogues) are of great interest due to their 
stability under harsh thermal and chemical environments.68 The high surface area of 
the nanosheets, the Lewis and Brnsted acidities of the Zr clusters, and the ability to 
postsynthetically functionalise the surfaces through modulator exchange, have 
enabled 
their 
use 
in 
promoting 
thermocatalytic,9 
photocatalytic,10,11 
and 
electrocatalytic reactions.12,13 

Combining Zr4 (andor Hf4) with ditopic carboxylate ligands typically results in three
dimensional metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)14 rather than MONs.
