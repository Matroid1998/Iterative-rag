A material with unsustainable refinement and production routes that are energy-intensive and highly polluting.

Text:
Increasing technological demands, rising inflation, and global ecological crises of the modern 
era pose challenges that require extensive research dedicated to improving energystorage 
technology using highperformance, economically viable, and sustainable materials. Currently, 
lithiumion batteries (LIBs) dominate the field of energystorage technology due to their 
relatively long life cycle and high energy density 1. However, the primary anodic material used 
in LIBs for commercial purposes, graphitic carbon, faces limitations in terms of its low 
theoretical gravimetric capacity of 372 mAhg, hindering its potential for future technologies 
2. Furthermore, the unsustainable refinement and production routes of both natural and 
synthetic graphite are energyintensive, highly polluting, and geopolitically problematic.

Description:
A material with exorbitant costs, used in battery production.

Text:
Accordingly, the exorbitant costs of batterygrade graphite (8,00015,000 USD per ton) are 
rapidly increasing amidst recent uptakes in electric vehicle production 3 4 5. Consequently, these 
significant concerns are driving the exploration of sustainable alternative materials for battery 
production. In this context, Silicon is a promising candidate for nextgeneration LIB anodic material in 
accordance with its high theoretical gravimetric capacity of 4200 mAhg and relatively low 
cost as the second most abundant element on earth 6 7. However, poor intrinsic electrical 
conductivity (103 Scm) along with extreme volume expansion (420) during lithiation 
significantly hinders its rate capability and cycling stability, thereby commercially limiting the 
use of siliconbased anodes 8 9.
