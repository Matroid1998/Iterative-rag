Description:
A small organic acid that is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and a major component of secondary organic aerosols.

The small organic acid, pyruvic acid (PA), and its conjugate base, the pyruvate ion (PA),
are common chemical constituents of aerosols, fogs, clouds as well as seawater.1,2 PA is ubiq
uitous in the atmosphere and emitted from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources and has
been detected as a major component of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) at many geographic
locations.3,4 These include the urban atmospheres of Japan,5 China,68 and Mongolia9 but
PA has also been detected in remote aerosols at mountaintops in China,3 tropic Indian
aerosols,10 marine aerosols,1113 arctic aerosols,14 and even in biomass burning aerosols in
Brazil.15 The particlephase concentration of PA has been observed to possess a large spa
tiotemporal variability with average particlephase concentrations measured as high as 49.7
ng m3 in SOA of the urban atmosphere of Tokyo, Japan and as low as 0.03 ng m3 in marine
aerosols over the Southern Ocean.5,12 Furthermore, particlephase concentrations of PA are
observed to fluctuate significantly depending on season.4,5
In the aqueous phase, PA has been subjected to many photochemical investigations
and has been reported to produce acetoin, lactic acid, and acetic acid and possibly also
contribute to SOA mass through an oligomerization process, which goes via the parapyruvic
acid dimer.1620 Furthermore, PA has been found to exist as a mixture of the keto form and
its hydrate, the geminal diol 2,2dihydroxypropanoic acid (termed diol in this study).20,21
Hence, PA interconverts between the diol, the conjugate base of the diol, and the conjugate
base of PA, PA, in a cyclic manner.20 The ratio of abundances of the keto form and the diol
has previously been reported to be 65 diol and 35 keto in aqueous solution, at 298 K and
neutral pH.16,20,22 Furthermore, the pKa of PA in its keto form in aqueous solution and at
298 K is determined to be 2.18 while for the diol, it is determined to be 3.6.20 In perspective,
aerosols are usually acidic with a median pH of 2.5, which implies that PA in its keto form is
the most favored in aerosols at normal ambient conditions.23 In addition to the pure aqueous
phase studies of PA, there has also been conducted several photochemical experiments of PA
in e.g.
