The use of polyphosphate and orthophosphatepolyphosphate blends for corrosion 
74 
control in drinking water distribution systems is controversial. While polyphosphate is 
75 
effective for controlling aesthetic water quality issues (i.e. discoloration, calcium scaling) 
76 
1,2, it increases lead release through aqueous complexation or colloidal dispersion 35, 
77 
and leadpolyphosphate complexes have been observed in tap water 6. A limited 
78 
understanding of orthophosphatepolyphosphatelead interactions leaves utilities that 
79 
use these additives vulnerable to lead contamination at consumers taps. 80 
Individual polyphosphates may differ widely in their effects on water quality structural 
81 
differences strongly determine polyphosphate interactions with metal ions. Linear 
82 
polyphosphates (e.g. tripolyphosphate) are more effective sequestrants than 
83 
cyclophosphates (e.g. trimetaphosphate, hexametaphosphate) 7,8.

Description:
Effective for sequestering iron and inhibits the dissolution of hydroxyapatite.

Gosselin and 
84 
Coghlan (1953) found that polyphosphates were equally effective at sequestering 
85 
calcium at relative phosphorous concentrations of 1, 12, and 65 for TripolyP, 
86 
HexametaP, and TrimetaP, respectively. The dissociation constants of calcium (pKD  
87 
3.56 vs 6.5) are lower with TrimetaP than TripolyP (Van Wazer  Callis, 1958). Short
88 
chain cyclophosphates (e.g. trimetaphosphate) can also be effective for sequestering 
89 
iron 9 but increased chain length (e.g. hexametaphosphate) greatly increases calcium 
90 
complexation. McGaughey (10 showed that trimetaphosphate was least effective at 
91 
preventing calcium precipitation compared to tripolyphosphate or hexametaphosphate 
92 
and it inhibited the dissolution of hydroxyapatite, whereas the other two polyphosphates 
93 
solubilized the mineral. This may be due to steric constraints characteristic of
