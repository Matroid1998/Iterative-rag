Description:
Plays a pivotal role in the structural characteristics of the hydrogen bond network in water.

Text:
Deceivingly simply at first sight, it is well known that
liquid water shows anomalous properties that have been exten
sively observed and documented like the density anomaly2,27,28,
high heat capacity10,25,29, high boiling and melting points3,30,
high surface tension31,32, high dielectric constant33,34, and high
viscosity35,36. Despite substantial advances in the understanding
of the behavior of water, the origins of these anomalies are not yet
entirely elucidated neither by experiments nor theory, although
it has been widely recognized that the structural characteristics
of the hydrogen bond network under thermal fluctuations play a
pivotal role for these unique features4,3741. Significant challenges exist in conclusively capturing atomic
