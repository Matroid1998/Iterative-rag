Description:
A clean energy source produced through water splitting with low carbon emissions and high energy efficiency.

Text:
Modern societies are powered by fossil fuels but the extensive use of these resources has unin
tentionally caused substantial harm to our environment. In future, we need to cut down the
carbon emissions and shift to renewable, clean, and sustainable energy technologies.1, 2, 3
Green hydrogen produced through overall water splitting (OWS) catalysis has become the
preferred choice given its low carbon emissions and high energy efficiency.4 However, the pro
duction of hydrogen through water splitting relies on the use of noble metal electrocatalysts to
