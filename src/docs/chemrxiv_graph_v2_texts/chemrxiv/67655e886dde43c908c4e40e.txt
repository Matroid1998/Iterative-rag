Description:
Photonically active trivalent ions used in upconversion nanoparticles.

Text:
Autoclave reactors are used 
in many aspects of chemistry and materials science, including synthesis of many types of nano and 
micromaterials,1,2 metal organic frameworks,1 catalysis,3 hydrogenation,4 polymerisation,5 materials testing,6 
digestion,7 singlecrystal casting,8 and corrosion testing.9 Autoclave reactors have been widely used as a 
method of synthesis for upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and are therefore the focus of this perspective. UCNPs are inorganic crystalline nanostructures consisting of a lowphoton energy host lattice doped with 
photonicallyactive trivalent lanthanide ions.
