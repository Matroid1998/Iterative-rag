Description:
Compounds used for replacing azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine in bioactive compounds for photoaffinity studies.

In addition, they are a part of more 
than one hundred drugs.32 Therefore, it is even hard to believe that 
in the 21st century, the corresponding CF3CHF2diazirines for 
replacing azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine in bioactive 
compounds for subsequent photoaffinity studies, remain unknown. During the past years, we often received requests from 
pharmaceutical companies on those structures.33 Therefore, we 
needed to elaborate first on a general practical synthetic route to 
access them.
