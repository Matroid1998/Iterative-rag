Description:
Groups that contribute to the high electronegativity of mucins.

Mucus, a biological dynamic hydrogel, covers all wet epithelial cells and plays a crucial role in 
various biological functions.12 It mediates the coexistence of various microbes essential for 
digestion and protects cells from infection caused by diverse external pathogens.36 Mucins 
(typically about 23 wv) are the key component of mucuss biological hydrogels, and they 
determine the properties and functions of mucus.7 Mucins exhibit a number of important 
characteristics, including the following they are highmolecularweight glycoproteins; they are 
highly electronegative owing to their sulfates and carboxylate groups; they feature filamentous 
elongated fiberlike structures; they show broadspectrum antiviral properties; and they can 
undergo chain elongation and crosslinking, via disulfide linkages in their cysteinerich 
domains, to create extended 3D network structures of very high molecular weight.8 Mucin 
networks are formed through disulfidebased linkers (mesh size 40 nm to several m) that 
show unique biophysical properties.912 At the macro scale, bulk viscoelastic properties control 
mucuss abilities to lubricate, to capture infectious pathogens via processes such as coughing 
and mucociliary clearance (MCC), and to protect underlying cells from viral infection using 
size filtration and interaction filtration owing to the presence of diverse functional groups.13 
In the case of lung diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
cystic fibrosis (CF), the cysteinerich domains overcrosslink, leaving diseased mucus with a 
higher number of disulfide bonds.1415 Under these compromised conditions, MCC stops and 
the thickened mucus becomes less effective against viruses and the infections they can cause.
