Description:
A scaffold used in luminescent metal complexes.

Fluorescent materials based on maingroup metal complexes 
have attracted a lot of interest recently, due to i.a. their potential use 
in optoelectronic devices, a wide range of biological applications or 
as chemosensors.14 The key advantages of such materials are their 
ready availability5 and, unlike many transition metal complexes, 
low toxicity. The earliest references to luminescent metal complexes 
can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century.6 However, 
1987 saw a breakthrough, when an Alq3 (qH  8hydroxyquinoline) 
compound was presented as the emitting layer in the first light
emitting diode.79 This seminal work provided the impetus for 
seeking more effective metal complexes with 8hydroxyquinolinato 
scaffolds, and in particular, the group 13based luminescent 
complexes.
