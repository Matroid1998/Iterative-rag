Description:
Compounds adsorbed onto pectin powders obtained from citrus biowaste.

IntegroPectin is the name of a new family of citrus pectins of exceptionally high 
and broad biological activity obtained via hydrodynamic cavitation of citrus biowaste 
carried out in water only.1 Obtained from orange,2 grapefruit3 and lemon4 
industrial processing waste, the pectin powders rich in adsorbed flavonoids and 
terpenes so far described have been isolated via freeze drying. Widely used in the pharmaceutical and food industries, the latter technique to dry 
biopharmaceuticals, food and biological materials with little or no degradation 
requires very low temperature (54 C) and pressures (high vacuum) in order to 
achieve sufficient drying rates.5 The technology is evolving towards continuous 
processes capable to reduce the energy consumption, shorten drying times and fit 
continuous flow synthetic processes.
