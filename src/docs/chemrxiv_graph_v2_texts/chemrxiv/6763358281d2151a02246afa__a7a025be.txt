Description:
A skeleton structure that can be accessed from stevioside.

Text:
To address these limitations, our lab chose stevioside 1 
as a starting material due to its costeffectiveness and abil
ity to rapidly provide access to the entkaurene skeleton. The 6,6,6,5ring skeleton required for synthesizing 
cafestol or the intermediate entkaurenoic acid is inherently 
present in stevioside, requiring only a rearrangement of the 
CD ring for entkaurenoic acid and the addition of a furan 
ring for cafestol synthesis. Additionally, we were pleased to 
successfully perform quantitative extraction of the interme
diate entkaurenoic acid from sunflower, providing quick 
access to the substrate for total synthesis.
