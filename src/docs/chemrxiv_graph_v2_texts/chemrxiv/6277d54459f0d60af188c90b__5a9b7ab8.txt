Description:
A material synthesized at high pressure and temperature with a Vickers hardness of 76 GPa.

In 2001, cubic boron carbonitride of BC2N composition (cBC2N) was synthesized at high 
pressure  high temperature conditions 1. The new phase possesses Vickers hardness of 
76 GPa 2 which make it the second after diamond hardest material. At ambient pressure in 
an inert atmosphere cBC2N remains stable up to 1800 K, and, thus, is characterized by 
significantly higher thermal stability than polycrystalline diamond. A year later, superhard lowcompressible cubic BNC solid solutions with stoichiometry close 
to BCN (cBCN) were synthesized by isoentropic shock compression 3. According to TEM
SAEDEELS studies 4, boron, carbon and nitrogen atoms are homogeneously distributed 
over cBCN crystal lattice without forming superstructures.
