Description:
Microporous crystalline materials primarily comprised of silica tetrahedra.

Text:
Variations in the size and shape of the 
pores, as well as different chemical properties of the pore environment can also influence catalytic 
phenomena. 9,14,1924 
Zeolites are excellent materials for learning about the roles of solvents in microporous 
catalysts. Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials primarily comprised of silica tetrahedra.25
27 Their catalytic activity and selectivity can be tuned via their compositions andor pore 
topologies.28,29 Zeolites can further be made more or less hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) in order to 
tune performance through solvent effects.13,30,31 Strategies for tuning zeolite hydrophilicity include
