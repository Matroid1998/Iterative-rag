Description:
A component whose high product purity and recovery are economic drivers in separation processes.

This data is then passed onto detailed PSA 
process models whereby MOFs are evaluated under realistic separation conditions.6 At this

high CO2 product purity and recovery, or low energy penalty (energy required to capture a
