Description:
A functional group directly attached to an sp2 hybridized carbon atom of a phenyl group in phenols.

Text:
Phenols are compounds with a hydroxyl functional group directly attached to a 
sp2hybridized carbon atom of a phenyl group. Namely, they are compounds containing 
one or more hydroxyl groups attached to benzene or another arene ring 1. Many manufactured products such as dyes and oils, among others, have in their 
composition phenolic compounds that are of natural origin 2. They are present in 
vegetables in free form or linked to sugars (glycosides) and proteins 3. These 
compounds also lead to the polymerization of natural polyphenols such as lignin and 
melanin, besides forming an important class of antioxidants, which inhibit the oxidative 
degradation of organic or bioorganic molecules 2,4,5.
