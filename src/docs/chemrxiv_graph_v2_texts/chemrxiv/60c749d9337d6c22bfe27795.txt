Description:
Important synthons in organic chemistry used for a variety of chemical transformations.

The results from ML models are helpful in building 
a chemical library that is otherwise tedious to explore by screening each reaction to check substrate 
feasibility under certain reaction conditions. To date, there is limited literature precedence for 
prospective prediction of desired chemical reactions and interpreting its reactivity using machine 
learning methods.10,11 We provide a first report, to the best of our knowledge, of a fast and onepot 
multicomponent reaction to explore heterogenous reactivity of Nsulfonylimines by training a human
interpretable machine learning model that identifies chemical patterns of reactivity to predict and test 
new reactions prospectively. We selected Nsulfonylimines as our model substrate because Nsulfonylimines are one of the important 
synthons in organic chemistry that are being used for a variety of chemical transformations.
