Description:
Highly toxic compounds associated with carcinogenic, endocrine, and cardiovascular diseases.

Text:
Arsenicals are highly toxic compounds whose chronic exposure has been associated 
with carcinogenic, endocrine, cardiovascular diseases, skin and lung damage, diabetes, and 
metabolic syndrome14. The arsenic toxicity is related to its ability to replace phosphate 
groups in biomolecules, showing a strong affinity with SH groups of cysteinyl residues5,6. Among the removalremediation strategies, adsorption is ecofriendly, economical, efficient, 
and simple. The solidphase adsorption reduces undesirable byproducts, adsorbent materials 
separate by filtration and recovered for repetitive uses applying simple basicacid 
treatment7,8. In this regard, novel layered materials for arsenic sorption have emerged as 
new alternatives to commercial adsorbents, featuring a large surface area, high adsorption 
capacity, straight synthesis, and easy recovery.
