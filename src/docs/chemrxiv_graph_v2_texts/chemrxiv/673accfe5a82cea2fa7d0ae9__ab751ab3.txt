Description:
The most active copper surface for CO2 dissociation with an activation energy of 0.64 eV and a high initial dissociative chemisorption probability.

On
the lowindex planes of copper surfaces, CO2 only adsorbs weakly and has a high activation
barrier for dissociation, with Cu(110) being the most active.1 Nakamura and Campbell have
reported the activation energy for dissociation of CO2 on Cu(110) to be 0.64 eV, with an
initial dissociative chemisorption probability (S0) of the order of 109 at room temperature
conditions.7 These studies were performed by exposing a clean Cu(110) single crystal to high
pressure (few mbar) CO2, and measuring the Oatom coverage (resulting from dissociation)
using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The
activation energy was determined by studying the rate of Oatom coverage buildup at dif
ferent temperatures.
