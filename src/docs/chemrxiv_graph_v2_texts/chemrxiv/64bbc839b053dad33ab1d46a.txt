Description:
Moderately reduced the affinity for NL6 amyloid.

Text:
of an ester 
functionality to the spacer was tolerated (1c vs. 3d), although 
the addition of an amide moderately reduced the affinity for 
NL6 amyloid (1b vs. 3c). Comparison of 3c and 3e showed that 
extending the spacer to approximately 23  in the linear dis
tance between BG and reactive amine was tolerated. The ben
zoylation hardly proceeded with any of the substrates in the ab
sence of the NL6 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 3B, plotting the affinities of the substrates 
for the NL6 amyloid (IC50) versus the reaction yields ()
