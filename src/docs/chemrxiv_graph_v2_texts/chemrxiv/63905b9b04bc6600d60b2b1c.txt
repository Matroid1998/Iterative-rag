Description:
A reactant in the Biginelli cyclocondensation, an acid-catalyzed multicomponent reaction.

Text:
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have enabled the rapid chemical synthesis of 
complex and diverse molecular scaffolds, and this has, in turn, accelerated the 
discovery of small molecules with therapeutic potential 1, 2. The Biginelli 
cyclocondensation is a threecomponent acidcatalyzed MCR between an aldehyde, 
ketoester, and urea, which has been used to produce dihydropyrimidinone and 
tetrahydropyrimidinone heterocycles 35. One such dihydropyrimidinone, monastrol 
(1), was found to be a potent inhibitor of kinesin Eg5, a motor protein necessary for 
the assembly of mitotic spindle fibers, thereby inducing apoptosis by preventing the 
development of spindle bipolarity and arresting cells in mitosis 68. This discovery 
has inspired the synthesis of other antiproliferative dihydropyrimidinone scaffolds, 
including LaSOM63 (2), which unlike monastrol, induces apoptosis of glioma cells 
through inhibition of ecto5nucleotidaseCD73 activity 9.
