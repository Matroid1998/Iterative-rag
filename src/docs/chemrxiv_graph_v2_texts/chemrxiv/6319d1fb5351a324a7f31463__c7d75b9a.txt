Description:
A third-generation EGFR inhibitor structurally related to osimertinib with an aminopyrimidine core and acrylamide warhead.

recently, osimertinib has been shown effective, and clinicallyapproved, as a frontline 
therapy in untreated patients harboring EGFR L858R and exon19del activating 
mutations.6 

Figure 1. Chemical Structures of thirdgeneration EGFR inhibitors osimertinib and 
lazertinib. As osimertinib is the only approved thirdgeneration EGFR TKI for L858R and 
exon19del EGFR mutant tumors, development efforts from Yuhan and Janssen biotech 
sought to produce a drug with improved medicinal chemistry properties. These efforts 
resulted in YH25448 (lazertinib), which is structurally related to osimertinib comprising an 
aminopyrimidine core and acrylamide warhead but is distinct with respect to the 
substituted pyrazole as well as morpholine groups (Figure 1).7 Preclinical headtohead
