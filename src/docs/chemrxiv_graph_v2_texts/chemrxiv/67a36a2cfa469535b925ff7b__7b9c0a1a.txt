Description:
A solvent that facilitates the dissolution of sulfur and generates 1ethyl3methylimidazolium thione.

Text:
In a recent publication1, we examined the kinetics of the reactive dissolution process of 
elemental sulfur (cycloS8) in 1ethyl3methylimidazolium acetate EMImOAc which 
generated the corresponding 1ethyl3methylimidazolium thione (EMImS). Taking into 
account the formation of reactive Nheterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which are formed by 
imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs),29 we were able to show that a nucleophilic attack from 
the carbene disrupts the sulfur ring system and degrades the S8system stepwise.10 With the 
help of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultravioletvisible (UVVis) and continuous wave 
electron paramagnetic resonance (cwEPR) spectroscopic data, it was also possible to detect 
intermediates that are formed and further converted during the reaction.
