Description:
Binds in the coordination site for substrate halogenation in halogenases.

Text:
This 
coordination environment typically consists of a facial triad composed of two histidines and either 
an aspartate or glutamate for hydroxylases or an alanine or glycine for halogenases.1618 The 
substitution of the hydroxylase carboxylate in halogenases opens a coordination site for the binding 
of either chloride or bromide for substrate halogenation.19,20 
During the catalytic cycle, the transient Fe(IV)oxo species homolytically cleaves the target 
CH bond through a hydrogen atom transfer reaction (HAT).21 HAT results in a radical 
intermediate and a hydroxyl ligand, which then recombine to hydroxylate the substrate.
