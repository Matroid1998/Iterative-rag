Description:
An element used in the classification of elements based on specific ratios of combination.

Text:
The PSCE was built upon a relatively small repertoire of compounds available to pioneers of chemistry in the 19th
Century (around 11 thousand compounds were reported by 186926). Chemists have exponentially expanded the number
of compounds since then27,28 and nowadays they amount to tens of millions. Compounds played a key role on the
similarity relations found by Mendeleev, whose famous classification of elements was based on their specific ratios of
combination with Oxygen and Hydrogen.
