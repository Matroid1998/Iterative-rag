Description:
Participates in halogen bonding to initiate radical chain mechanisms.

Text:
In an early example, the radical silyldifluoromethylation 
of electrondeficient alkenes was reported.16 Herein, a very 
specific interaction, based on halogen bonding between the 
substrate and an NHC borane, was needed to trigger the de
sired CX bond photolysis and subsequently initiate the 
radical chain mechanism sustained by the LBR (Figure 1C). Inspired by this report, we questioned whether it would be 
possible to realize a more general strategy to generate the 
pivotal ligated boryl radical. Such a pathway might allow the 
engagement of a broader array of substrates, ultimately 
leading to a general approach for CC bond formation.
