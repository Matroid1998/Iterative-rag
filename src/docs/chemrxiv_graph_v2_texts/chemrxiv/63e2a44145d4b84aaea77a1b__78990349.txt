Description:
High-quality gate oxide layers are required for many applications but are hindered by the lack of unsaturated surface sites on TMD surfaces.

Still, despite the advantages, the intrinsic properties of TMDs have
also resulted in several technological bottlenecks. The low chemical
activity of the basal plane often results in a high contact resistance at
TMDmetal (electrode) interfaces, which can lower the performance
of TMDbased electronic devices 2527. Furthermore, the lack of
unsaturated surface sites hinders the growth of metal oxides on TMD
surfaces, despite many applications requiring highquality gate oxide
layers 2831. Limited surface interactions also reduce the number

of analytes that TMDs can efficiently detect, restricting the applica
tion perspectives 3234. As a result, significant effort has been put
into overcoming those limitations, notably employing substitutional
doping 3539.
