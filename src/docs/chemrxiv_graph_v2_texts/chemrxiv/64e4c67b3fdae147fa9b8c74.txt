Text:
Small molecules with hyperpolarized 13C nuclear spins1 represent probes with exquisite chemical and spatial 
resolutions for realtime in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).2,3 The most important example is 113C
pyruvate, which has been used to detect and monitor the development of prostate cancer in human patients, from 
an early stage4.
