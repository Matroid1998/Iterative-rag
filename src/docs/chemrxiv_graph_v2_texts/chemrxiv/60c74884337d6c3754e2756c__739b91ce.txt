Description:
A binary oxide structure where defects play a critical role.

Text:
Defects are ubiquitous in functional materials and play a critical
role in materials as simple as the binary rocksalt oxides1,2 and
as complex as hightemperature superconductors3. The impor
tance of vacancy chemistry to molecular framework perovskites
is becoming increasingly clear4 in many important families,
including the hybrid metalhalide semiconductors5,6, cyanide
Prussian Blue analogue battery cathodes7,8 and magnetic for
mate perovskites9,10, as the number of studies making use of
defectengineering in these materials grows. Perhaps the most
widespread strategy for introducing defects is aliovalent doping,
where an ion is replaced by an ion with a different charge. Thus
far, cationic dopants have been the most widely used and have
been introduced onto both the A, e.g.
