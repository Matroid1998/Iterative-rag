Description:
Characterized as low molecular weight compounds that are potent and highly ligand efficient.

Text:
The early inhibitors (16)6 can all be characterized as aryl carboxylic acids or 
corresponding acidbioisosteres with low molecular weight. Although they are potent and highly ligand efficient, 
they lack the vectors that are needed for optimization of potency and physicochemical properties. To that end in 
2013, Astellas reported a new class of DAO inhibitors (7) which contain a tail group reaching into a hydrophobic 
pocket perpendicular to the head group.7 Takeda also worked on a similar chemical series which culminated in the 
discovery of their clinical candidate TAK831 (8).
