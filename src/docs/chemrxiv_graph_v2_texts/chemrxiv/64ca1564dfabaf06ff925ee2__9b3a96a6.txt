Description:
A complex involving NO ligands often studied for oxidation state assignments.

Text:
Fifty years ago, in a master stroke, Enemark and Feltham chose to sidestep the problem of local 
oxidation states by assigning an effective d electron count n to metal nitrosyls.9 Now known as 
the EnemarkFeltham electron count, n refers to the number of metal d electrons plus the 
number of NO p electrons; thus Fe(II)  NO corresponds to n  6  1  7 and is denoted as 
FeNO7. Despite the popularity of the notation, chemists have retained a strong interest in the 
oxidation state problem and have sought to assign oxidation states to both the metal and NO 
fragments in nitrosyl complexes. Unfortunately, density functional theory, the major 
theoretical tool for such studies,10,11,12,13,14,15 suffers from several pitfalls.

Description:
Complexes that require spectroscopically calibrated approaches to determine local oxidation states.

Text:
To start with, the 
DFT description generally does not correspond to a pure spin state, but incorporates 
contamination from multiple states. In addition, different exchangecorrelation functionals 
provide disturbingly divergent descriptions of metalligand covalence and of spinstate 
energetics.16,17 In the face of these challenges, chemists have increasingly resorted to a so
called spectroscopically calibrated approach, i.e., a combination of several spectroscopic 
methods and DFT calculations, to come up with local oxidation states in nitrosyl 
complexes.18,19,20,21,22,23 Modern multiconfigurational methods and orbital localization schemes 
provide a neat alternative to these somewhat ad hoc approaches, as we illustrated recently in a 
study of transition metal corroles.24 Here we present a stateoftheart DMRGCASSCF
CASPT2 study of seven paradigmatic FeNO porphyrin derivatives spanning FeNO68 
electron counts (Scheme 1).
