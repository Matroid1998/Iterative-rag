Description:
A molecule whose gas-phase addition to N2 is endothermic by almost 48 kcal/mol.

Text:
N2 is a remarkably inert molecule. The energy required to break one of its p bonds has been 
estimated to amount to approximately 110120 kcalmol, and consequently, gasphase addition 
of a single H2 molecule is endothermic by almost 48 kcalmol (though once the initial addition
