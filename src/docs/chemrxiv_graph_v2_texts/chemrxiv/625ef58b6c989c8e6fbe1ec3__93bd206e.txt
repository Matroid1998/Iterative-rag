Description:
A gas transported by blood to every part of the human body.

Text:
Bloodstain TSD is typically estimated by modelling the physicochemical degradation of 
78 
blood biomolecules over time; experimental methodologies generating spectroscopic 79, genetic 1012 
79 
and photographic 13,14 metrics have been developed and used to estimate bloodstain TSD. Factors like 
80 
individual variation, type of substrate and environmental conditions influence the timewise degradation 
81 
of bloodstains and their biomolecules, resulting in large variability in the accuracy and precision of TSD 
82 
estimation models 1,15,16. 83 
Blood is a nonNewtonian fluid responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis in vivo by providing 
84 
transport of oxygen, carbon dioxide, minerals, and electrolytes, among others, to and from every part of 
85 
the human body.

Description:
Binds to hemoglobin to form oxyhemoglobin, which is capable of carrying oxygen.

Text:
Oxygen 
93 
bound to Hb is referred to as oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) while Hb without oxygen is referred to as 
94 
deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) 17. In vivo, every day roughly 3 of oxyHb is autoxidized to methemoglobin 
95 
(metHb), a derivative incapable of binding and carrying oxygen 1,18. In healthy Hb, such as oxyHb and 
96 
deoxyHb, iron is present in its ferrous state (Fe2), compared to the oxidized metHb in which iron is 
97 
present in its ferric state (Fe3) 1,7,17. In vivo, internal reduction mechanisms including enzymes 
98 
glutathione peroxidase and methemoglobin reductase are responsible for maintaining low levels of 
99 
metHb by converting Hb to its healthy derivatives (1,19).
