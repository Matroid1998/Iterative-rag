Description:
Support materials with exceptional stability, high surface area, and tunable chemical properties, enhancing catalytic activity.

Text:
In this aspect, polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN), as a 
support material, have recently become an invaluable support to design robust SACs due to their 
35 
exceptional stability, high surface area, and tunable chemical properties, ultimately enhancing their 
catalytic activity, and enabling precise control over their reactivity (1417). It is important to 
highlight that, from a sustainability perspective, nitrogensubstituted carbon and polymeric carbon 
nitrides (PCN) emerge as promising green photocatalysts due to their reliance on abundant 
elements during the design and preparation phases (18, 19). Considering this, tremendous efforts 
40 
have been paid to achieve transformations such as small molecule activations (1319). However, 
their application into regioselective CH bond functionalization is still in its infancy. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024vgzvh ORCID httpsorcid.org000000024577438X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
