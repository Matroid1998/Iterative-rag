Description:
Cubic solid solution with studied structural, optical, and magnetic properties.

Text:
In the literature there are data on structural, optical and magnetic properties of cubic solid solutions 
in the NiOZnO 1214, MgOZnO 15,16 and MnOZnO 17 systems, while solid solutions of 
the FeOZnO system remain poorly studied. The latter system is of particular interest because in the 
series of 3d metal monoxides FeO (wstite) has the largest magnetic anisotropy constant 18, the 
widest region of oxygen nonstoichiometry, which accounts for its high specific electrical 
conductivity 19,20 of the hole type (ptype) 21. In contrast, zinc oxide (wZnO) remains a wide
gap ntype semiconductor even after treatment at high temperatures and pressures 22.
