Description:
Commonly used in microelectronics due to its ease of use, excellent chemical stability, and low cost, but has low thermal conductivity ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 Wm1K1 at room temperature.

The high integration and power density of electronic devices can lead to heat accumulation, 
which can negatively impact their performance and lifespan.1,2 Thermal interface materials 
(TIMs) are used to transfer heat from a heat source to a heat sink.3,4 Epoxy resins are commonly 
used in microelectronics because of their ease of use, excellent chemical stability and low cost, 
but they often have low thermal conductivity ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 Wm1K1 at room 
temperature.5,6 Despite the widespread use of lowcost ceramic fillers such as alumina (Al2O3)7, 
silicon nitride (Si3N4)8, aluminium nitride (AlN)9, and silicon carbide (SiC)10 as thermally 
conductive fillers, the resulting epoxy composites still demonstrate a low thermal conductivity, 
which remains below 2.0 W m1 K1.
