Figure 1. Violaceoids AC and Eutyscoparol A. In 2014, Sugawara and colleagues isolated violaceoids AF 
from a culture broth of Aspergillus violaceofuscus Gasperini.1 In 
2020, Z. Zou, H. Tan and coworkers reported the isolation of 
eutyscoparol AG from Eutypella scoparia SCBG8.2 Violaceoids 
AC (13) and eutyscoparol A (4) share a the structural skeleton 
comprising the 2,3alkylated quinol moiety and a hydroxymethy 
group (Figure 1.).
