Description:
A halide that coordinates the metal center in nonheme iron halogenases.

Text:
For nonheme 
iron halogenases in particular2830, e.g., SyrB231, 32, CytC333, 34, WelO535, and BesD,36 the active 
sites are similar to other nonheme iron enzymes with only one major change. In comparison to 
more well understood nonheme iron hydroxylases,3739 the halogenases have a halide coordinating 
the metal center, i.e., native chloride or nonnative bromide. This halide is bound in place of a 
carboxylate of the 2His1carboxylate facial triad of the hydroxylases4042 because in the 
halogenases there is no carboxylatebearing aspartate or glutamate residue present and instead a 
noncoordinating alanine residue is typically present to create a hydrophobic pocket for halide 
binding.
