Description:
Forms hydrogen bonds in protic solvents, influencing optical spectra.

Additionally, the condensed phase environment
can strongly influence optical spectra, both through en
vironmental polarization effects and direct chromophore
environment interactions, such as hydrogen bonding in
protic solvents.611 Slow, generally anharmonic, collec
tive chromophoreenvironment motion also poses a chal
lenge and is often of importance in complex biological
systems.3,12,13 Robust computational approaches capa
ble of capturing these effects from first principles are de
sirable, as experimental condensed phase optical spectra
are often highly congested, making it challenging to es
tablish structureproperty relationships from experimen
tal data alone.
