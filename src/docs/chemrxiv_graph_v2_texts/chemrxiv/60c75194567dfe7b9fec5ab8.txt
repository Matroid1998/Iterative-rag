Description:
Thought to be insoluble in certain electrolytes.

Text:
In electrolytes 
where LiO 2 is thought insoluble, Li
2O2 would grow as thin passivating surface film (2428
), leading 
to poor rates and low capacity. The prevailing mech
anism not only determines rate and capacity 
(5, 7, 1719, 2830), but also impacts parasitic ch
emistry (7, 17, 3133). However, the extent to 
which these mechanisms prevail is still not clear a
nd so is the truly capacity limiting factor, which 
could be either e
 transport through a thin Li
2O2 coating or mass transport (O
2, LiO2, Li) through a 
porous particulate Li
2O2 deposit (25, 28, 30, 3436). Measures and governin
g factors for Li 2O2 
packing density, determining capacity still need re
finement.
