Description:
A low-energy feedstock used in the conversion to renewable chemical fuels.

Text:
Rational catalyst design is an important strat
egy for improving the efficiency of conversion of
lowenergy feedstocks like CO2 and H2O into re
newable chemical fuels.1 Hydrogen (H2) gener
ation receives significant attention in this area,
as the reaction involves transfer of multiple pro
tons (H) and electrons (e). Effective cata
lysts for H2 generation avoid highenergy bar
riers while also coupling the individual H and
e transfers involved in the catalytic cycle to
gether to drive HH bond formation.
