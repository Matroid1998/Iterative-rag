Description:
Involved in the bond cleavage of tertiary alcohols using CpTiCl3 as a catalyst.

Text:
In 2020, Wang, Shu et al. re
ported the first CO bond cleavage of tertiary alcohols using 
CpTiCl3 as a catalyst.4 In the meantime, the development of 
sustainable chemical reactions with less waste using photo
redox chemistry5 and electrochemistry6,7 has gained momen
tum recently. In 2021, Li et al. reported nickelcatalyzed de
hydroxylative crosscoupling using electrochemistry.8 This 
reaction is an excellent way to directly form C(sp2)C(sp3) 
bonds from primary and secondary alcohols. From 2021 to 
2023, MacMillan et al. reported a direct alcohol conversion 
reaction using NHC, photoredox catalyst, Ni or Fecatalyst.9 
This reaction is applicable from primary to tertiary alcohols. Iron is abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, and has been used 
for a long time.
