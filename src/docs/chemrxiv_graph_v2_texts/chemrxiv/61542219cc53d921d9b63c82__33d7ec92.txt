Description:
Toxic and dangerous stoichiometric reagent used in traditional synthesis methods.

Text:
Nmethylamine is a highvalue chemical product, which is widely used in the fields of drugs, 
bioactive products, dyes, preservatives, and agrochemicals18. Traditional synthesis methods 
require toxic and dangerous stoichiometric reagents, such as halogenated methane 9, dimethyl 
sulfate 10, or diazomethane11. Reactions using these reagents produce a large amount of waste 
and exhibit low selectivity due to excessive alkylation to N, Ndimethylamine. At present, more 
environmentally friendly methylating agents such as formaldehyde 12, formic acid 13, 14, and 
carbon dioxide 1520 are also used to synthesize Nmethylated amines, but the reaction requires 
excessive reducing agents or more stringent reaction conditions, such as high reaction temperature 
or excessive reducing sources, such as silane, molecular hydrogen, and so on.
