Description:
A heterocycle that supports reactions with high levels of enantiocontrol.

Text:
of heterocycles, such as quinoline (3y, 3z), benzothia
zole (4a), indole (4b, 4c), benzofuran (4d), phenothiazine (4e), py
rimidine (4f, 4g) did not diminish the reaction efficiency, affording 
the desired corresponding products with high levels of enantiocon
trol. The compatibility of this protocol with bioactive molecules 
was also investigated. For instance, substrates bearing clofibrate 
(4h), fenofibrate (4i), indometacin (4k), and derivatives of amino 
acids (4j) and cholesterol (4l) could be employed to provide the 
corresponding products in moderate to good yields with excellent 
ee, which underscore the potential application for rapid modifica
tion of drugs and natural products. Subsequently, we investigated the substrate scope of the secal
kylzinc reagent.
