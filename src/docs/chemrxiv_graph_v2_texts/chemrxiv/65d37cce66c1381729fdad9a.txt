Description:
A gas that TMD-based sensors exhibit exceptional sensitivity toward, even at room temperature.

TMDs
have unique physicochemical properties 1620, which enable rapid
desorption of analyte molecules and high charge transfers between sheets
and selected species. The latter is further emphasized by an excep
tional surfacetovolume ratio, which makes TMDs highly sensitive to
molecule adsorption. This sensitivity allows for notable changes in
their electronic and optical signals, making them ideal platforms for
gas detection. For instance, recent studies have shown that TMDbased
sensors exhibit exceptional sensitivity toward NO2, even at room tem
perature 2123. Furthermore, subsequent works have demonstrated
that the sensitivity and recovery of such devices can be further en
hanced by using gate bias 24, 25 and light illumination 2628. All of these aspects make TMDs compelling materials to use for
sensing layers, especially in the case of monitoring NO2.

Description:
The gas with the highest response in selectivity measurements relative to other gases.

Text:
Still, among
the unresolved issues, the selectivity of detection remains a persistent
challenge that needs to be addressed to fully unlock their potential for
IoT integration. Although a degree of selectivity was mentioned in pre
vious reports 23, 26, it should be noted that the reported selectivity
means the highest response toward NO2, relative to other gases, thus
the greatest change in the measured parameters between the analytes
tested at the same concentrations. The difference reported is quite sub
stantial. Hence, TMDs could improve the poor selectivity of chemire
sistors.
