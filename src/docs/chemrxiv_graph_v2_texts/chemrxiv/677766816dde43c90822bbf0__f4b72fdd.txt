Description:
A component of the usable inventory in batteries that can be depleted due to irreversible loss of active materials.

Text:
Nanoscale inhomogeneities build up in electrode particles during cycling, and decrease the 
reversibility of the battery reactions1,2. Both the irreversible structural damage in individual 
electrode particles, for example the fracturing of Si negative electrodes35, and the formation of 
electrochemically inactive species, for example the formation of the solidelectrolyte interphase 
(SEI)6,7, lead to the irreversible loss of active materials and depletion of the usable lithium 
inventory and electrolyte8. Resolving the three dimensional (3D) spatial distribution of 
heterogeneous degradation at the single electrode particle level with nanometer resolution can shed 
light into battery degradation pathways and their reaction kinetics, leading to the development of 
new materials and strategies for improved battery performance.
