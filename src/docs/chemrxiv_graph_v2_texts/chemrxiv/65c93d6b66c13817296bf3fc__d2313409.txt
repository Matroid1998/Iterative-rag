Description:
A component of LMR layered oxide materials used as positive electrodes in lithium-ion batteries.

Irreversible oxygen loss is a wellknown challenge in Li and Mnrich (LMR) layered 
oxide materials, which are promising positive electrodes for lithiumion batteries1. This 
phenomenon, written in KrgerVink notation in Eq. (1), involves transition metal (TM) 
reduction, oxygen vacancy (V
) formation, and the irreversible loss of oxygen from the 
crystalline lattice

In general terms, we use O2 in Eq. (1) to represent any oxygen lost from the crystalline 
lattice that is unable to return to its original O2 state. Most intuitively, it would include 
molecular gaseous oxygen which has been observed directly during the first delithiation of LMR 
electrodes25.
