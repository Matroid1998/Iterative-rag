Description:
A molecule with a triple bond formed by its four sp valence orbitals.

Text:
The  bond is a defining feature of transition metal chem
istry. Facetoface overlap of d orbitals in transition metal
dimers produces quadruple, 1 quintuple, 2,3 and sextuple 4
bonds by using the six s  d valence orbitals for MM bond
ing. Such high bond orders are impossible for main group
compounds, which are limited to triple bonding by their four
sp valence orbitals, though there have been debates about
quadruple bonds in main group diatomics. 57 Highorder
twocenter bonds form only when the valence orbitals are
not used for bonding to other atoms, as in the triple bond
in N2 and the sextuple bond in W2. Orbital interactions in solids underpin the structures and
electronic properties of materials just as they do in molecules.
