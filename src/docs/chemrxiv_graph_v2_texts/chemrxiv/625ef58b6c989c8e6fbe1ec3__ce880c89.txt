Description:
Part of internal reduction mechanisms that maintain low levels of methemoglobin.

Text:
Oxygen 
93 
bound to Hb is referred to as oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) while Hb without oxygen is referred to as 
94 
deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) 17. In vivo, every day roughly 3 of oxyHb is autoxidized to methemoglobin 
95 
(metHb), a derivative incapable of binding and carrying oxygen 1,18. In healthy Hb, such as oxyHb and 
96 
deoxyHb, iron is present in its ferrous state (Fe2), compared to the oxidized metHb in which iron is 
97 
present in its ferric state (Fe3) 1,7,17. In vivo, internal reduction mechanisms including enzymes 
98 
glutathione peroxidase and methemoglobin reductase are responsible for maintaining low levels of 
99 
metHb by converting Hb to its healthy derivatives (1,19).
