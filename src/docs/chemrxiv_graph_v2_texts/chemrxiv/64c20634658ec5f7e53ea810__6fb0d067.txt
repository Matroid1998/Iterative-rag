Description:
A noble metal oxide that remains one of the most active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Text:
Its worth noting that IrO2 and RuO2 noble 
metal oxides still remain the most active OER catalysts, often used as benchmark 
catalysts to compare new ones. Perovskite oxides have emerged as a promising family of nonnoble 
metal oxides for catalyzing the OER1719. In 2012, ShaoHorns research 
group reported an exceptional OER activity of a perovskite oxide BSCF20. Its intrinsic OER activity was at least ten times higher than that of IrO2 nanoparticles 
(average diameter 6 nm). Subsequently, they discovered that perovskite oxides 
undergo surface reconstruction accompanied by the dissolution of metal ions
