Description:
Compounds with smaller head group size compared to conventional phospholipids and two hydrophobic tails.

Text:
Considering the smaller head group size of the 
diacylcysteines compared to conventional phospholipids, and the presence of two hydrophobic tails, we suspected that 
diacylcysteines would have a much lower critical aggregate concentration (cac compared to singlechain fatty acids of 
similar tail lengths, which may enable vesicle formation even with very shortchain thioester precursors. Here we report the spontaneous diacylation of Cys with shortchain choline thioesters (CTs , forming celllike giant 
membrane vesicles (Figure 1A . Diacylcysteine compounds with very short C) hydrophobic tails form lamellar vesicle 
structures at submillimolar concentrations, likely because the compact head group has a comparable crosssectional 
area to the two short hydrophobic tails.
