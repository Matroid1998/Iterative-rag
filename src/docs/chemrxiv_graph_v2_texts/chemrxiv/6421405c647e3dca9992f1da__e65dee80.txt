Description:
A Grignard reagent synthesis prone to Wurtz coupling.

Text:
By using different 
pumps (syringe pump, pulsating valveless rotary piston pump 
and pulsationfree micro annular gear pump) and by applying 
oscillating flow conditions, the residence time distribution of 
the magnesiumfilled reactor cartridge and its dependence on 
the pumpinduced flow behaviour were determined and 
Bodenstein numbers and mean residence times were 
calculated. In part 2 of this publication, the impact of residence 
time distribution and backmixing on the selectivity of Grignard 
reagent formation was investigated by utilizing the synthesis of 
benzylmagnesium bromide, an exemplary synthesis prone to 
Wurtz coupling.
