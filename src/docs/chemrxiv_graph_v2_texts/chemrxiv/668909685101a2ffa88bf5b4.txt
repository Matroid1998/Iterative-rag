Description:
Used in isoelectronic systems instead of carbon for studying aromatic compounds.

However, accord
ing to the purpose of this study, it is important to highlight
the plethora of research analyzing the reduction and ioniza
tion potentials of benzene and related compounds based on
the nature and orientation of various substituents4351. With the arrival of the 21st century, the study of other
properties of benzene and related aromatic systems in
terms of substituents continued generating interest, such as
aromaticity52,53. This type of systematic studies relating the
substituents of aromatic compounds to their features has been
extended even to isoelectronic systems based on boron instead
of carbon54,55, as well as to the intermolecular interactions be
tween the substituted aromatic compounds themselves5659,
forming dimers.
