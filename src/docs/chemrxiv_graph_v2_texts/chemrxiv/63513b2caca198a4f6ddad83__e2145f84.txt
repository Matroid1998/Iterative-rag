Description:
Participates in the exchange reaction with methoxy ketone in the presence of PMe3.

The reversibility of 
the oxaMichael reaction is rather 
discussed as major drawback in small 
molecule 
synthesis19 
and 
decomposition products caused by 
retro oxaMichael were observed.20 
More explicitly, evidence for the 
reversibility of oxaMichael reaction is 
indicated by the exchange of methanol 
in methoxy ketone with dmethanol in 
presence of PMe3.21 Similar studies 
show that the addition of deuterated 
methanol to vinyl ketone is reversible as 
deuterium is incorporated in the 
position of the vinyl.22 In our group, we
