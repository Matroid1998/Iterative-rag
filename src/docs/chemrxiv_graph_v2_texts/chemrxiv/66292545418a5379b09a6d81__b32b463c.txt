Description:
Used for bridging Cys residues via fluorine displacement.

bridging Cys residues using perfluoroaryl bracesfluorine 
displacement22, 23 (and alternative bridging groups24, 25), thiol 
coordination to bismuth,26 thioladdition chemistry,27, 28 and 
desulfurative replacement of a disulfide bridge.29 Incorporation 
of nonstandard amino acids enables the exploitation of 
chemoselective (bioorthogonal) chemistry such as azidealkyne 
cycloaddition30, 31 (i.e., Click Chemistry), Staudinger ligation32 
and azidephosphonite chemistry.33 Simple imine34 and oxime35 
bond formation has been utilized, as well as more complex 
transition metal (TM)catalyzed3641 and multicomponent 
chemistry.42 Radical reactions such as thiolene4345 and, more 
recently, decarboxylative photoredox catalysis46 and CH 
alkylation47 have also been successfully applied. Among this 
broad range of available synthetic techniques, Grubbs
