Description:
Product of the F and NH3 hydrogen-abstraction reaction.

Text:
Resonances spanning the transition state region have been identified for the atomdiatom reactions I  HI 
and F  H2,2021 while entrance22 and exit23 channel resonances have been characterized for the F  CH4 and 
F  CH3OH reactions, respectively. Dynamical resonances  quasibound states along the reaction pathway 
lying high in energy than the reactant asymptote  have been shown to strongly influence reactivity and 
dynamics.24 
Here, we present a joint photoelectron imaging and quantum dynamics study of the F  NH3  HF  NH2 
hydrogenabstraction reaction, based on highresolution photodetachment of the FNH3 anion. The F  
NH3 reaction is highly exoergic (10422 cm1), and an accurate global PES (Fig.

A product studied via infrared chemiluminescence in reactions involving F and ND3.

1) has recently been 
determined by fitting a large number of highlevel ab initio points in full dimensionality.25 Previous 
experimental work on the title reaction has studied the vibrational distribution of the HF product via infrared 
chemiluminescence2628 More recent crossed beam experiments by Yang and coworkers29 have shown that 
the HF products (or DF in the F  ND3 reaction) are largely forward scattered with respect to the incoming 
F atom. Quasiclassical trajectory studies on the dynamics and kinetics of this reaction have been reported
