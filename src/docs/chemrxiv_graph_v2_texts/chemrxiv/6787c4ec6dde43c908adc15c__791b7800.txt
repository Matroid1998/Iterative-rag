Description:
A component of heme protein catalysts used for diastereo and enantioselective synthesis.

Text:
In particular, we surmised 
that efficient heme protein catalysts could be identified and fur
ther evolved to allow for the diastereo and enantioselective 
synthesis of cyclopropane (1R,2S)4 using vinylpyrazole 5, 
which could be conveniently prepared by SuzukiMiyaura
