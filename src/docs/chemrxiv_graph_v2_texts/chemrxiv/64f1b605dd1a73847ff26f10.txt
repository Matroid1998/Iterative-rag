Description:
An abundant element used in electroactive organic materials.

In addition, the largescale production of these 
materials is limited by their reduced resources availability and 
raises serious environmental concerns.3,4 Several critical 
elements used in LIBs, such as cobalt, would inevitably face 
supply shortages in the near future5 and raise some 
environmental and ethical concerns.6 
Electroactive organic materials have long been proposed as 
alternatives to inorganic electrodes due to their tuneable 
electrochemical 
performance, 
resource 
availability, 
environmental friendliness, and flexibility.4,711 They are 
composed of abundant elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, sulphur, etc.) and may have higher specific capacities 
than those of conventional inorganic electrodes.
