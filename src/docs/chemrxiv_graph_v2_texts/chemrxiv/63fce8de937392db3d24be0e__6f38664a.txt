Description:
A type of polyisocyanate that has received very little development.

Text:
Therefore, both academic and industrial researches have 
focused on the enhancement of the sustainability in 
polyurethanes by developing a wide range of new biobased 
polyols.3,4 
On 
the 
contrary, 
biobased 
polyisocyanate 
monomers have known less development,5 especially aromatic 
isocyanates, which have received very little attention.6 One of 
the main reasons for this lack of development is the need to use 
phosgene gas to obtain isocyanate molecules. Indeed, the acute 
toxicity of phosgene gas is a major hinder to the development 
of phosgenebased industrial processes. Since 1928, when the 
first accident related to phosgene occurred in Hamburg,7 
numerous industrial incidents and accidents involving phosgene 
production andor use have been reported. Especially, lethal 
industrial accidents have been reported by DuPont8 and BASF9
