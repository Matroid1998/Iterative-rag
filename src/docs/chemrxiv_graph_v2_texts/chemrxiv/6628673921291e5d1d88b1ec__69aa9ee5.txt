Description:
A unique carbon allotrope first observed in the condensed phase in 2019.

Text:
Cyclocarbon is a cyclic molecule composed of sphybridized carbons connected 
to each other. Earlier, cyclocarbons have been explored experimentally and there are 
evidences of their formation in the gas phase,14 but for a long time, no one can 
provide direct molecular morphology for them. In 2019, cyclo18carbon (C18) was 
first observed in the condensed phase,5 ending a longstanding controversy over the 
structure of this unique carbon allotrope and reigniting a wave of research on it.
