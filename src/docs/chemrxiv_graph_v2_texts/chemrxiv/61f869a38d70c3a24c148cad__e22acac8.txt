In the current glass market, there is a great need for inorganic materials that are mechanically strong with respect to 
mechanical wearing, can withstand high temperature processing, and possess enhanced wettability with large water 
contact angles. Such materials are interesting for applications in photovoltaic panels installed in rainy or high humidity 
areas, windows of buildings, automobiles, etc. RareEarth metal oxides (REOs) possess hydrophobic properties 1. Cerium dioxide (ceria), which cation is the most 
abundant lanthanide in the Earths crust 2, exhibits a large bandgap between 3.03.6 eV 35 which makes this 
material promising for the abovementioned applications. The original explanation of the ceria wetting behavior was 
based on its electronic structure 1.

Description:
A material deposited on substrates after cleaning.

Text:
To terminate the etch and remove any etchant remaining on 
the Sisurface, the wafers were immersed in a 5 HCl solution for 120 seconds and subsequently rinsed and dried 
using N2 gas. The mass loss from the wafers was found to be roughly 6 of the initial value. Before deposition of 
ceria, Sisubstrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in isopropanol for 10 minutes, rinsed with deionized water and 
dried in N2 gas at room temperature. For the reference samples, we utilized nontreated flat Siwafers as substrates.
