Description:
Perovskites that form CoOxHy layers in alkaline electrolyte with enhanced activity in the presence of trace-level Fe.

oxides also involve active Fe sites14. La1xSrxCoO3 perovskites form CoOxHy layers in 
56 
alkaline electrolyte with enhanced activity in the presence of tracelevel Fe electrolyte 
57 
species15. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 undergoes surface reconstruction and transforms to OER
58 
active CoFe oxyhydroxides16. In fact, Fecontaining (oxy)hydroxides are ubiquitous for 
59 
OERactive materials including transitionmetal oxides, sulfides, selenides, and 
60 
phosphides1719. 61 
Typically NiFe and CoFe hydroxides adopt structures analogous to phase 
62 
Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2, which consist of layers of M(OH)6 octahedra with rotational 
63 
disorder and waterions intercalated into the interlayer space2023. The Fe3 is thought to 
64 
substitute for the M2 sites with the extra charge balanced by intercalated anions24.
