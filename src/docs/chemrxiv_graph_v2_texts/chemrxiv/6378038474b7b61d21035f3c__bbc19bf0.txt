Description:
The electronic structure of benzene and its cation was studied using x-ray spectrum and high-level calculations.

Text:
The ability 
to laserproduce tabletop HHG sources reaching up to 300 eV 
opened opportunities to implement the laser pumpprobe technique 
with ultraviolet (UV) excitation probed by soft xray radiation in 
the carbon Kedge region with tens of femtosecond time 
resolution.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 
Recently, we applied this technique to measure the xray 
spectrum of the benzene radical cation (Bz).9 Together with high
level calculations using equationofmotion coupledcluster singles 
and doubles theory (EOMCCSD), this study provided insight into 
the electronic structure of benzene (Bz) and its cation.10 
Comparison of the xray absorption spectra of neutral Bz and of 
Bz revealed a splitting of the two degenerate  orbitals as well as 
an appearance of a new peak due to a new transition to the partially 
occupied  orbital resulting from the ionization.

Description:
Interacts with the bromine lone pair orbitals, affecting ionization energies.

Text:
The next two lower molecular orbitals are 11b1 (Brtype) and 5b2 
(Brtype) that are related to the 4p bromine lone pair orbitals, 
which are split due to the interaction with the benzene ring.12,13,14 
The ionization energies from these two orbitals are 10.633 eV and 
11.188 eV, respectively.13 
The bromine atom affects the core level transition energies as 
well. Previous studies have shown that15 the 1s orbital of the carbon 
atom (C) nearest to the bromine atom is shifted to higher binding 
energy by about 1.1 eV relative to the 1s orbitals of the other 
carbons (C), as shown in the orbital diagram of BrBz in Figure 1.

Description:
A ring-shaped molecule with lower symmetry affecting orbital splitting.

Text:
The splitting of the other 1sC orbitals due to lower symmetry of the 
benzene ring is much smaller.15 The different electron distribution 
in the valence and core levels due to bromine attachment leads to 
several changes in the xray spectrum of neutral BrBz compared to
