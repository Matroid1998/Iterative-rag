Text:
Azaindoles are heterobicyclic aromatic organic compounds consisting of a pyrrole ring 
fused to a pyridine ring. Being structurally different from indole only by one additional nitrogen 
in the sixmembered pyridine ring, the azaindole moiety exhibits interesting biochemical and 
pharmacological activities.1, 2 Scientists identified that methylated azaindole chromophores 
could serve as blue or even green fluorescence protein markers.3 Among various structural 
isomers of nazaindole, 7azaindole derivatives (see Figure 1 for the atom numbering) are 
excellent blue emitters for organic lightemitting diodes (OLEDs).4

Although one can find a handful of articles on 7azaindole in isolated monomer,58 in 
dimeric forms5,913 and water and alcohol clusters,11, 1420 only one recent article21 to date shed 
light upon the photophysical relaxation mechanism of nazaindole molecules by studying gas
phase excitedstate dynamics. Experiments and theoretical calculations have also been 
devoted16, 18, 2224 to understanding the excitedstate proton transfer and tautomerization 
mechanism of 7azaindole with solvent molecules. On the other hand, very recently, Noble et
