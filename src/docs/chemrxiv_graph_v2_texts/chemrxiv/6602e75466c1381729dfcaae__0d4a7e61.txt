Meanwhile, the exploration of the NaSn system revealed the astonishing structural variety of 
the compounds with opened tin frameworks, acknowledging the versatility of the SnSn bond. 13 Depending on the atomic ratio NaSn, the dimensionality of the tin network in binary phases 
can vary from zero to threedimensional (0 to 3D), and the SnSn bonding ranges from 
localized twocentertwoelectron (2c2e) bonds to purely metallic bond. On the Narich side, 
the charge transfer from Na to Sn is often enough to allow the Sn anions to achieve the octet as 
isolated species. But in the Snrich side, the Sn atoms are forced to form bonds to each other, 
resulting in polyanionic tin subunits with opened frameworks having various connectivity and 
bond types.
