Description:
A metal that forms a complex and is activated through energy transfer in a C-heteroatom coupling system.

Ir(ppy)3 and a phenoxazine (PhenO) PC; ppy 
 2phenylpyridine and PhenO  3,7di(1,1biphenyl4yl)
10(naphthalen1yl)10Hphenoxazine) to a Ni complex to 
generate a Ni centered excited state that was crucial for catalysis 
(Fig. 1B). Based on these reports, we hypothesized that energy 
transfer would also be the mode of activation of Ni in our 
unified Cheteroatom coupling system as these same PCs are 
used.
