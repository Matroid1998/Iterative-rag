Description:
A cyanine dye studied for its structural and optical properties.

Understanding the driving forces
that govern the formation of specic structures and the monomer arrangement inside the
aggregates is of major importance in order to design molecules with specic chemical fea
tures and, ultimately, predict their supramolecular structures and properties. Computational
modelling, in particular molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, are a powerful tool to aid in
the rational design process of supramolecular biomolecules and nanomaterials8,9. One of the cyanine dyes that has been extensively studied the past decades is 5,5,6,6
tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine11,12 (see Figure 1b). Several molecules with this specic
core and dierent substituents have been designed and synthesised, and their structural
and optical properties have been examined13,14.
