Selective barriers are essential in nature and technology for controlling the transport of 
compounds and enabling compartmentalization. In particular, the fabrication of ion sieving 
membranes is critical for many applications such as nanofluidics,1 flow batteries,23 
biosensing,4 desalination,5 energy conversion,6 and others. These processes normally 
involve separations of certain ionic species from complex mixtures, which require membranes 
with enhanced ion selectivity.7 However, since ions have very similar sizes in the sub
nanometer (subnm) range, achieving an efficient ion sieving performance remains a great 
challenge. Crystalline porous materials such as graphenegraphene oxide (GO),8 
metalcovalent organic frameworks (MOFCOF),910 and porous organic cages (POCs)11 
provide rigid subnm channels, making them in principle ideal for such applications. However, 
these membranes are burdensome to prepare, difficult to scaleup, and expensive.
