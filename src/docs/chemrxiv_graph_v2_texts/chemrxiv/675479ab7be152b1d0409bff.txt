Description:
High concentrations in soil are associated with zinc deficiency.

Text:
Zinc (Zn) deficiency affects approximately 50  of soils around the globe1,2. This deficiency 
results in reduced yield and low ZnII content in rice grains3 with severe consequences for the 
health of people with a ricebased diet4 becoming one of the major nutrient disorders in 
humans. Zinc deficiency is responsible for numerous illnesses and diseases, affects 
neurobehavioral development and compromises reproductive health, increases susceptibility 
to infectious diseases, including the risk of pneumonia in children5,6. The most common soil 
conditions associated with zinc deficiency include high concentrations of phosphorus (P), 
sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg), organic matter content 3 wt, neutral or alkaline pH, 
high electrical conductivity (EC), high carbonate content and low redox potential due to 
prolonged waterlogging. These soil chemical conditions are commonly found in paddy soils6.
