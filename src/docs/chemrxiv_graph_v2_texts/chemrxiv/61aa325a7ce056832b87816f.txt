Description:
Tetra substituted alkenes synthesized using thiocarbonyl and diazo.

Text:
Synthesis of tetra substituted alkenes by using thiocarbonyl and diazo were reported in 
the literature12. We are particularly interest, the combination of thiophosgene with diazo 
derivatives, the compounds obtained by these combinations are thioether3, thiazolines4

5 dihalo alkene6, thiocarbonyl chlorides7, thioisocyate8 and thiourea9. Dihalo alkene also 
reported by using CCl4 under anhydrous conditions10. Present work 
We are interested in the synthesis of dihalo alkenes because it is usefulness for 
converting into active intermediates1113 by using thiophosgene and its halo versions 
(CSBr2 or CSI2).
