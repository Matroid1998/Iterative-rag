Description:
Used as a mediator to perform one-electron oxidation.

Text:
For example, Ye and coworkers recently demonstrated us
ing 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidinooxy (TEMPO) as a media
tor to perform oneelectron oxidation of I to III, providing 
access to amino radicals after deprotonation of III for 
radicalradical crosscoupling reaction (Figure 1B).9 How
ever, finding a suitable mediator to achieve desired redox 
transformations remains a challenge.
