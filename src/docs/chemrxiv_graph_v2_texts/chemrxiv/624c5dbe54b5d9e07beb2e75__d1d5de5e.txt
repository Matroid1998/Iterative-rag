Description:
Reacted with N2 to synthesize ammonia.

Text:
Sutton and coworkers made a breakthrough when they regenerated 
AB from PBZ by using hydrazine (N2H4) as a reductant in THF 
medium.12 Unfortunately, N2H4 is produced from ammonia which is 
synthesized by reacting N2 with H2 through a high energyconsuming 
HaberBosch process, thus essentially making the regeneration 
process unsustainable.13 Recent advances made in producing N2H4 
electrocatalytically from N2 and water with the help of solar or wind 
generated electricity, may ensure sustainability.14 Advancement in N2 
activation 
chemistry 
can 
possibly 
negate 
this 
problem.15 
 Monoboron and bisborane Lewis acid based catalysts have 
been employed to dehydrogenate AB successfully by Wegner  co
workers, with bisborane system showing slightly higher efficacy than 
that of the mono boron system.16 Wegner et. al.

Description:
Released in more than 2 equivalents per equivalent of AB by a boron-based catalyst at 60°C.

Text:
reported that a metal 
free boron based 9,10dichlorodiboraanthracene (bisborane) (1ClCl) 
catalyst releases more than 2 equivalents of H2 per equivalent of AB 
at 60 0C in the presence of 14 mixture of THFdiglyme (Dg) solvent 
(Scheme 1).16 The high efficiency involved in the catalytic AB 
dehydrogenation process may be attributed to the high Lewis acidity 
of the two boron centres attached with electronegative Cl atoms which 
promotes BH activation of the AB system. Incidentally, the presence 
of two Lewis acidic sites and a definite geometry of bidentate boron 
based Lewis acid catalyst make it distinct from the other monoboron 
based Lewis acids in terms of high catalytic activity.

Activated by bulky Lewis acids B(C6Cl5)x(C6F5)3x in THF solvent.

Ashley and coworkers 
demonstrated for the first time the prospect of H2 activation by the 
bulky Lewis acids B(C6Cl5)x(C6F5)3x x 0 to 3 in THF solvent which 
was followed by hydrogenation of imine.5e Herein, we have tried to 
understand if there is a role of the Lewis basic diglyme solvent as a 
hidden partner of the Lewis acidic bisborane system in developing a 
FLP like cooperativity in the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB. Our 
previous experiences with computational design based monoboron 
based dehydrogenating systems have shown that action of solvent
