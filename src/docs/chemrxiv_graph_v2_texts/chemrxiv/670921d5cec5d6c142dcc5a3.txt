Description:
Does not have favorable properties for crossing the blood-brain barrier.

Text:
A few of these have already been investigated as 
potential PET tracers (Figure 1), but none of them turned out to be successful.12,14,15 The two ethyl 
nicotinate derivatives 11C1 and 11C2, do not have favorable properties for crossing the bloodbrain 
barrier (BBB).14,15 The two thienopyrimidinebased tracers, 11C3 and 18F4 fall within a slightly better 
property range, but were both unsuccessful in vivo. Notably, the 18Flabeled PET tracer candidate 
demonstrated brain uptake under efflux transporter blocking with tariquidar.14 Taken together, the 
results with these tracer candidates showcase the importance of targeting lead compounds with better 
physicochemical properties for brain permeability. Herein, we describe our exploration of a series of 
fluorinated pyrazolidine3,5dione derivatives as potential P2Y12R PET tracers. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2024l9kch ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000287077574 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BYNC 4.0
