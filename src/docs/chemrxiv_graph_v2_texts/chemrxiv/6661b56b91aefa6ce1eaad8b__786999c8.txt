Description:
Chiral compounds synthesized through biocatalytic routes with excellent enantioselectivity.

In this context, it is of particular interest to develop more sustainable 
chiral amines synthesis methods 7,8. Biocatalytic routes have gained considerable attention in the last decades as potentially 
effective and sustainable alternatives. Remarkably, amine transaminases (TAs) catalyse the 
direct synthesis of chiral amines from prochiral ketones, using cheap and readily available 
amino donors (e.g. aminoacids) through transamination, with excellent enantioselectivity and 
in mild conditions. TAs are catching the eye as tremendous achievements have been made 
recently, both at the fundamental and applied levels 917. Industrial applications of biocatalytic 
transamination, however, remain scarce for TAs are usually employed as free enzymes in 
solution, which display limited stability. Batch processes utilizing such free enzymes do not 
allow easy catalyst separation, recovery, and reuse 1820.
