Description:
A radical scavenger that significantly inhibits reactions.

of a radical scav
enger, 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidine 1oxyl (TEMPO), sig
nificantly inhibited the reaction (Fig. S1). A radicalclock 
reaction led to a ringopening alkene product (2au) (Figure 
2A). These radical trap and radical clock experiments sug
gested a radicalmediated mechanism. Crossover experi
ments with substrates 1h and 1ag resulted in exclusive for
mation of noncrossover products 2h and 2ag, indicating 
an intramolecular acyloxy shift mechanism (Figure 2B). Further studies using deuterated substrates revealed a deu
teriumshifted product 2aw (Figure 2C), and crossover ex
periments with deuterated and nondeuterated substrates 
produced crossover products 2ad, supporting an intermo
lecular MHAT process (Figure 2D). Kinetic isotope effect 
(KIE) studies showed a KIE value of 2.9, implying a primary 
kinetic isotope effect (Figure 2E).
