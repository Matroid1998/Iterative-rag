The key initial step for converting the molecule into valuable products.

Theoretical approaches like those based on density func
tional theory (DFT),38 can elucidate specific processes re
lated to reactivity, such as surface reaction elementary steps.39
For instance, it is possible to model the CO2 activation, the
key initial step for converting the molecule into valuable
products.40,41 Several DFT studies model the full reaction
path for the CO2 conversion, on SAAs, to different products
like methanol and Ethylene.42,43
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can accelerate the discovery of
promising materials by identifying correlations and patterns in
data.44 Nonetheless, only few SAAs might present the prop
erties required for them to be useful in a specific application. This is often the case in catalysis, where only a handful of
compounds are known as efficient catalysts (active, selective,
and stable during operation).
