Description:
A formula representing surface-terminated MXenes.

Text:
MAX phases (M  early transition metal; A 
 Al, Si, Ga; X  C, N) are a large class of 
3D layered ternary compounds with the 
stoichiometry Mn1AXn (1  n  3).14 
MXenes are a similarly diverse class of 2D 
compounds derived from MAX phases via 
etching of the Asite atoms.5 It is well
established that MXenes are surface
terminated, and thus better represented by 
the formula Mn1XnTx (T  termination), 
however 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
surface 
composition, coordination, and spatial 
arrangements are exceptionally challenging 
to ascertain (Figure 1).
