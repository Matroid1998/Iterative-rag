Description:
A bulky substituent that proved detrimental to reaction efficiency.

Text:
of bulky adamantyl substituents (Al2) 
proved to be detrimental (e.r. 5842, entry 2). Moreover, substituting the cyclohexyl backbone with 
a diphenyl ethane motif (Al3, entry 3) also resulted in a lower e.r. (8020), relative to the parent 
catalyst Al1. Finally, the impact of varying the Xligand at the Alcenter was studied. Whilst 
oxygen bridged dimer Al4 was unselective under these reaction conditions (e.r. 4852, entry 4), 
replacing the chloro ligand by fluorine preserved efficiency, resulting in only a minor drop in 
selectivity (e.r. 8812, entry 5). Altering the reaction medium (e.g. to CH2Cl2 or MeCN) resulted 
in lowered reaction efficiency and therefore acetone was utilized for the remainder of this study 
(entries 6 and 7, for details see ESI).
