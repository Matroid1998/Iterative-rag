Description:
Biodegradable polymer used to prepare microspheres.

Text:
Then, this primary
waterinoil (wo) emulsion is dispersed in a second aqueous phase, forming a double water
inoilinwater (wow) emulsion. The solid microsphere is produced as the organic solvent
evaporates. In this work, we prepared blank PLGA microspheres (containing no polypep
tide) of grades 5050 and 7525 (lactideglycolide ratio), using the double emulsion process.2
Using the same technique, we also loaded PLGA microspheres at low and high concentrations
of exendin4, a glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide used to treat type 2 diabetes.7
The microspheres were subsequently freezedried. The objective of this work was to prepare,
characterise, and understand the structural dynamics of these peptide loaded biodegradable
polymeric microspheres. In order to optimise the formulation of microspheres and achieve release delivery of the
