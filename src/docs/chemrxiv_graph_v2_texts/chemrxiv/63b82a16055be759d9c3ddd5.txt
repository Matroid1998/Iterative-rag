Text:
Quantum interference (QI) is a phenomenon that can
be harnessed to increase or decrease the electronic con
ductance of singlemolecules. Originally reported for
benzene in the context of electron transfer,1destructive
quantum interference effects in molecules were first ex
plored theoretically
26before the suppressed conduc
tance was experimentally observed in monolayers710
and single molecules1114. Due to its utility in controlling electron transport,
there has been a significant focus on developing rules to
predict when quantum interference effects will dominate,
for example the graphical rules15, curly arrow rules16,17
and molecular orbital rules1820. While these rules allow
us to readily determine whether a molecule is likely to
exhibit suppressed conductance due to destructive inter
ference, they do not provide more insight into what is
interfering with what in these systems.

Description:
The cyclic structure of a benzene ring can represent quantum interference effects in molecular-sized devices.

Text:
When the size of the device is compa
rable to the electronic phase coherence length, QI effects
can manifest. This QI can change the electronic trans
port through molecular sized devices dramatically, as il
lustrated in Figure 1(b). The QI can be destructive or
constructive depending on whether the phase difference
between interfering paths are  or 0.22
We use the language of paths to draw an analogue
with the twoslit experiment, although no such paths in
physical space are evident through the molecule. While
there are mathematical arguments to support the idea
that the cyclic structure of a benzene ring can represent
