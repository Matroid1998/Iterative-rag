Description:
Atoms involved in bonds that are often treated as rigid, eliminating the highest frequency motions.

For instance,
bonds involving hydrogen atoms are often treated as rigid, which eliminates the highest fre
quency motions.1,2 Also, the repartitioning of masses from heavy atoms to bonded hydrogen
atoms has long been found to stabilize the time integration and make the use of longer time
steps possible.3 Such schemes, known as hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR), were system
atically applied to hydrogen atoms in proteins4 and lipids,5 allowing stable simulations using
4 fs time steps. The statistical mechanical basis of all these schemes is wellestablished, as
configuration space averages are independent of the masses in classical statistical mechanics. Walser et al. 6 rescaled the water masses to systematically modify the solvent viscosity.
