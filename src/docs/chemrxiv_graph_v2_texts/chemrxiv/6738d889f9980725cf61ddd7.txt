Description:
An SCO complex where the formation and breaking of a coordination bond extends the lifetimes of its photoexcited state up to 130 K.

In 
contrast, 
inorganic 
photomagnetic compounds typically rely on spin crossover (SCO) 
sites, which display lightinduced excited spin state trapping 
(LIESST) originating at the metal center.2427 Unfortunately, the 
photoexcited state of SCO systems suffers from rapid thermal 
relaxation above 80 K, which limits their practical applications as 
photomagnetic switches at room temperature. Nevertheless, a 
careful analysis of the microscopic origins of their photomagnetism 
offers 
clues 
for 
designing 
hightemperature 
magnetic 
photoswitches. For example, in the FeII(LN5)(CN)2MeOH SCO 
complex, the formation and breaking of a coordination bond 
extends the lifetimes of its photoexcited state that can be observed 
up to 130 K.28 Building on these insights, we propose a strategy 
towards hightemperature photomagnetic system based on 
photochemistry
