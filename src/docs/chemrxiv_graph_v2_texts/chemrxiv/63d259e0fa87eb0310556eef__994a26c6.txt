Description:
Cathode materials with high gravimetric and volumetric density but limited cycle life and high cost.

Decarbonisation of the automotive industry has highlighted battery technologies as a viable suc
cessor to petroleumbased travel. With increasing performance of stateoftheart Liion battery
materials comes a tendency to initiate degradative mechanisms more rapidly than acceptable
for commercially viable products. Even with the greatest gravimetric and volumetric density,
promising transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials can suer from limited cycle life, high
cost, and reduced performance. NMC (Li1Ni1xy Mnx CoyO2) based Liion batteries have
emerged as the most promising successor to LiCoO2 chemistry and could potentially facilitate
ubiquitous adoption of Liion in mobile and transport devices.1 High specic capacities, high
rate capability, and longterm cycling abilities are driving extensive research into these cathode
materials, forcing a greater nickel content with each iteration.
