Description:
A novel chemotype used in SeSP probes for selective reduction by TrxR5.

Text:
Yet, identifying substrates that allow 
fast and catalytic, specific ontarget processing, but are robust to 
other (di)thiol redox proteins or to monothiols despite their 
similar reduction chemistry, has been a major problem. In this paper, we will be working with SeSP probes built around 
a novel chemotype of bicyclic selenenyl sulfides (Figure 1a), in 
which several structural features must be combined (e.g., cis ring 
fusion, piperazine annelation, 1,2Se,N probe disposition). This 
design is intended to gain selectivity in the cellular context for 
reduction by TrxR5, while avoiding monothiol reduction, by 
leveraging several kinetic differences in their respective reduction 
pathways (Figure 1a, top vs bottom). This design is the culmination of several generations of 
dichalcogenide redox probe development.
