Description:
A metal involved in the active sites of nonheme iron halogenases and hydroxylases.

Text:
For nonheme 
iron halogenases in particular2830, e.g., SyrB231, 32, CytC333, 34, WelO535, and BesD,36 the active 
sites are similar to other nonheme iron enzymes with only one major change. In comparison to 
more well understood nonheme iron hydroxylases,3739 the halogenases have a halide coordinating 
the metal center, i.e., native chloride or nonnative bromide. This halide is bound in place of a 
carboxylate of the 2His1carboxylate facial triad of the hydroxylases4042 because in the 
halogenases there is no carboxylatebearing aspartate or glutamate residue present and instead a 
noncoordinating alanine residue is typically present to create a hydrophobic pocket for halide 
binding.

Description:
Nonheme iron halogenases natively carry out CH chlorination and CH bromination has been observed in vitro in SyrB2.

Text:
Despite this understanding of halogenases, it is extremely hard43 to develop selective 
processes for CH halogenation using synthetic methods due to the inertness44 of CH bonds and 
their high bond dissociation energy. Nonheme iron halogenases natively carry out CH chlorination28, 32, 35, and CH 
bromination has been observed in vitro in SyrB2 but with lower efficiency23, 45 than chlorination. This is corroborated by the abundance13, 46, 47 of chlorinated and brominated natural products. On 
the contrary, CH fluorination has never been observed23, 46, 48, 49 in any of the nonheme iron
