Description:
A compound that transforms between diamagnetic and paramagnetic states under external stimuli.

Text:
In contrast, most of the metaltometal electrontransfer (MMET) systems show a broad 
and high intense absorbancebased chargetransfer band. MMETbased bistable materials are 
also one type of PCMs in which the diamagnetic ground state (FeIILSCNCoIIILS) transforms into a 
paramagnetic metastable state (FeIIILSCNCoIIHS) associated with distinctly different optical, 
electrical, and magnetic properties due to the application of external stimuli such as light, 
temperature, pressure, pH, etc.12,18 In 2020, a Fe2Co2 molecular square, Fe(Tp)(CN)32Co(L)22
