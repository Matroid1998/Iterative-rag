Description:
A chlorinated solvent used in catalytic amidation reactions.

Text:
For larger scale reactions, DeanStark water removal is employed as this is considerably more 
efficient in terms of solvent usage and scalability, and there are a few reports of direct amidation reactions 
catalysed by boric acid or simple boronic acids being employed on an industrial scale.7 The solvents used for 
catalytic amidation reactions are typically aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene,2a,3a fluorobenzene2b), chlorinated 
solvents (1,2dichloroethane2i) or ethers (Et2O,5d THF,4a4b CPME,3e TAME3g3h), and these are often sub
optimal from a safety andor sustainability perspective.8 In addition, these relatively nonpolar solvents do 
not effectively solubilise many polar functionalised carboxylic acids or amines.
