Description:
Long-chain, soluble compounds formed during discharge in lithium-sulfur batteries, leading to active material depletion.

The remarkable theoretical specific capacity of elemental sulfur (1675 mA hg), its
ecofriendly nature, and its abundance make lithiumsulfur (LiS) batteries an attractive
alternative to current lithiumion batteries.1,2 Nevertheless, their cycle life has so far been
limited due to certain drawbacks. A notable challenge is the formation of longchain, soluble
lithium polysulfides during the discharge and their shuttling through the conventional elec
trolytes,3,4 which leads to a depletion of the active material and formation of an insulating
layer around the anode. All these processes result in an irreversible capacity fade in LiS
batteries.5,6 To tackle these issues, numerous studies have focused on structural optimization
of sulfur cathodes including utilization of sulfurcarbon copolymers.
