2431 Hence, 
it is imperative to develop new strategies to 
fabricate costeffective wearables. in this 
work, we presented a new inkjet printable 
reduced graphene oxide (rGO) ink method to 
fabricate a lowcost chemiresistive biosensor 
for lactate detection from sweat matrix with 
high sensitivity and selectivity, via inkjet 
printing of the rGO ink followed by 
optimized functionalizations. The sensor 
demonstrated a high response at 0.49 per 
M and low LOD at 23 M. 

2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
Lactate, Lactate oxidase (106 Umg), bovine 
serum albumin, buffers (100 mM PBS pH 8), 
PBASE, tween20, and rGO ink (793663) 
were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. 
Louis, USA). Artificial sweat was prepared 
with 1.1 wv NaCl, 0.12 wv lactate acid, 
0.13 wv urea at pH 8.
