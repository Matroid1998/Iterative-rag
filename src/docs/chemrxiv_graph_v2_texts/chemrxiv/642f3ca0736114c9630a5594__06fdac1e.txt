This is an intriguing 
problem because silanols contain two oxygens 
capable of nucleophilic attack, and a variety of 
heterocycles could form depending on the mode 
of aziridine ring cleavage (Scheme 1B).913 Our past work with silanols has illustrated that the nature of 
the substrate strongly dictates the ringsize of the product heterocycle (Scheme 1A); with these aziridine 
silanols, 5, 7, or 8membered heterocycles could conceivably form (Scheme 1B). Treatment of silanol aziridine A with catalytic Sc(OTf)3 and NaHCO3 in CH2Cl2 formed amino 
tetrahydrofuran B as the sole product (Scheme 2A). This result was exciting and a bit unexpected for several 
reasons. First, there was no trace of the silanol auxiliary.
