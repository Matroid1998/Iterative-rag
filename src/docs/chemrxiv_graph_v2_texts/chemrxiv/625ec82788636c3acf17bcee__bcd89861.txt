Description:
An adsorbate that binds to metal surfaces through the carbon atom in heterogeneous catalysis.

These
scaling relations result in the volcano relationships be
tween ratesselectivities and descriptors that are used ex
tensively in heterogeneous catalysis. It provides a theo
retical basis for the heuristic Sabatier principle,11 which
suggests that the optimal catalyst is one with an optimal
bond energies for relevant intermediate(s). The scaling
relations show which intermediate(s) are relevant and the
optimal value(s) for the binding energy of these interme
diate(s). Linear or piecewise linear scaling relationships are ob
served when two adsorbates bind to the metal through
the same atom such as C, CH, CH
2 and CH
