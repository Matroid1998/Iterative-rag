Description:
Highly emissive as single molecules in solution but nonemissive in aggregates due to aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).

Text:
Apart from welldefined complexes and single molecules, a particularly useful 
form of matter  that demonstrates modified or wholly new properties in comparison to its 
molecular components  is an aggregate (i.e., irregular clusters of many molecules). Among 
the many unique features only identified in aggregates are aggregationcaused quenching 
(ACQ) and aggregationinduced emission (AIE), which are among the top research fields in 
chemistry.1 For example, porphyrins as single molecules in solution are highly emissive. However, their aggregates are nonemissive (ACQ).1b Conversely, tetraphenylethene is non
emissive as a single molecule in solution yet becomes highly emissive as an aggregate (AIE) 
(Scheme 1, A).1a Clearly, aggregation states influence photophysical behaviour of molecules 
and by extension will influence their photochemical behaviour as well.
