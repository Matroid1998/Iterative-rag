Description:
One of the first widely-implemented classes of acceptor materials in organic solar cells.

Text:
Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a class of photovoltaics have many
advantages over traditional silicon solar cells, such as flexibil
ity, lower cost, and a wider range of solar spectrum absorption
through the tailorability of synthetic chemistry. The active layer
of OSCs is composed of ntype electronaccepting and ptype
electrondonating materials, hereafter referred to as the acceptor
and donor materials. Due to the low dielectric constant of organic
materials, two materials are needed so that the energy offset at
their interface can split the exciton formed from the solar energy
absorption into free charges.1,2
