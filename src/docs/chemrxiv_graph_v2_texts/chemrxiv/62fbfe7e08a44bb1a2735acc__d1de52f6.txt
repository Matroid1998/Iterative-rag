Description:
A type of polyolefin that is difficult to convert due to its inert C-C single bonds.

The soaring, largescale production of singleuse plastics creates huge amount of non
degradable waste that severely threats the environment.1, 2 The inefficacy of existing approaches 
for plastic waste processing, such as recycling and incineration,3 leads to the demands for chemical 
routes that upcycle plastics into valuable chemicals. Besides environmental benefits, upcycling 
plastics also compensates for the oil consumption by their production4 through circular economy. Polyolefins, including polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), are the most common types of 
plastics, making up  50 of the annual production,3 and also the most difficult to convert because 
they are entirely made of inert CC single bonds. As a result, the upcycling of polyolefins requires 
either high temperature in pyrolysis,57 which causes high energy consumption and low selectivity, 
or effective catalytic processes.
