Description:
A cyclocarbon oxide molecule prepared and determined by X-ray diffraction.

In fact, since Hoffmann put forward the idea of C18 in 1966 40, several strategies 
have been proposed to try to achieve this unique allotropic carbon, including synthesis 
by eliminating the heteroatomic substituents of its various cyclocarbon precursors 
through methods such as retroDielsAlder reaction 41, decomplexation 42, 
decarbonylation 43, and 22 cycloreversion 44. One of the two recent pioneering 
experiments to prepare C18 was achieved by sequentially removing a pair of carbonyl 
groups (CO)2 from a cyclocarbon oxide C18(CO)6, producing the C18(CO)4 and 
C18(CO)2 molecules in turn, up to the final product C18 1. Actually as early as 30 
years ago, Diederich and coworkers have successfully prepared C18(CO)6 molecule 
and determined it by Xray diffraction with the same purpose 43.
