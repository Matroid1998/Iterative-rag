of TmPyPB as an additional electron transport layer 
enhances charge carrier confinement and reduces nonradiative losses, as evidenced by both 
optical measurements and electronic device analysis. Our work culminates in the successful 
demonstration of solution processed PeLEDs with ultraviolet emission below 400 nm, surpassing 
the spectral limitations of previously reported devices while achieving reasonable EQE values. These findings not only highlight the potential of 2D perovskites in nextgeneration 
optoelectronics but also pave the way for further exploration into novel device architectures and 
material compositions, with the ultimate goal of realizing highly efficient, stable, and 
commercially viable ultraviolet electroluminescent devices. Methods 

Materials 
Phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl, 98), phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr, 98), 
and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999) were purchased from SigmaAldrich.

Description:
Component used in the preparation of perovskite materials.

Text:
Anhydrous 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9), anhydrous N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8) and 
anhydrous lithium fluoride (LiF, 99.99) were purchased from SigmaAldrich. Poly(3,4
ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOTPSS, Clevios Al 4083) was purchased 
from Heraeus. 2,2,2(1,3,5benzinetriyl)tris(1phenyl1Hbenzimidazole) (TPBi, 99.5) and 
1,3,5tri (mpyrid3ylphenyl)benzene (TmPyPB, 99.5) were purchased from Ossila. Al 
(99.99) pellets were purchased from Kurt J. Lesker Company. All chemicals were used directly 
as received. Perovskite precursor 
The perovskite precursor preparation was conducted inside a nitrogenfilled glovebox at room 
temperature. 0.1M PEA2PbCl1Br3 stock solution was prepared by dissolving stoichiometric 
PEACl, PEABr, and PbBr2 in DMSO then left under continuous stirring for 2 hours. The precursor 
solution was then filtered with a 0.22 m PTFE syringe filter before spin coating.
