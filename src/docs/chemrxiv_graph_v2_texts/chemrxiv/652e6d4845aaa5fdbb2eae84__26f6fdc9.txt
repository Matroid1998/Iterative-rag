Description:
A transition metal element whose resource scarcity is a concern for battery research.

Apart from good electrochemical performance, this 
work provides an additional indepth analysis of the redox mechanism and degradation 
mechanism related to capacity fading. 1. Introduction 
Since the commercialization of Liion batteries by the Sony corporation in 1991, the cathode 
material has proven to be the bottleneck for their specific capacities. Due to the rapidly 
expanding utilization of energy from renewable sources with intermittent nature, there is an 
increasing demand for efficient energy storage. Resource scarcity of transition metal elements 
such as cobalt and nickel is driving the research for a new generation of batteries, which are 
sustainable and lowcost.
