Description:
Conjugated structures with butadiyne linkers investigated for multivalent molecular recognition and aromaticity.

Text:
Conjugated cyclic porphyrin oligomers (porphyrin nanorings) 
with butadiyne linkers14 have been investigated extensively to 
probe cooperativity in multivalent molecular recognition,2 
extend the size limits of aromaticity3 and provide models for 
ultrafast energy migration in photosynthetic lightharvesting 
systems.4 Accurate crystallographic molecular geometries are 
valuable for analyzing hostguest interactions, and for 
understanding aromaticity,5 yet little is known about how 
porphyrin nanorings behave in the solid state.6,7 
Porous organic frameworks are widely investigated for 
applications such as gas storage and sensing,8 and many 
macrocycles have been reported to form porous crystals,9 
which suggests that porphyrin nanorings might exhibit this type 
of 
behavior. However, 
macrocycles 
such 
as 
cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs),10 cucurbiturils and cyclodextrins11 
often adopt compact nonporous herringbone packing 
arrangements when they crystallize.
