Description:
Characterised as an E-Z photoswitch by Hartley in 1937.

Photoswitchable small molecules are powerful tools for highprecision manipulations of a range of biological 
processes in live animals (in vivo) or in live cells.1,2 They may even be irreplaceable as tools to properly 
address systems in which spatiotemporal patterning of biological activity on the subcellularcellular or tissue 
level is crucial e.g. microtubule and actin dynamics in cytoskeletonsupported motion (subcellularcellular 
level)3,4, or firing of retinal neurons for vision restoration (tissue level)5,6. Hartley first characterised azobenzene as an EZ photoswitch in 19377. After Erlangers pioneering 
applications in protein and neuron control,8,9 azobenzenes became the most widelyused photoswitch from 
materials sciences10 to chemical biology.2,11 Recently though, a range of other photoswitches with distinct 
features are emerging, for better photocontrol of specific biological systems12,13.
