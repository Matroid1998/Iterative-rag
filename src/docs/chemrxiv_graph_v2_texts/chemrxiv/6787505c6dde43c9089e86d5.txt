Description:
Compounds with unknown AMPK activities.

Text:
In fact, there are instances where AMPK pro
motes tumor cell survival and that its deficiency represses 
tumor growth.2d,3 Therefore, the ability to regulate AMPK 
levels, including its inhibition, can have important 
implications for advancing cancer treatments. Controlling 
AMPK can also be developed into a strategy for modulating 
autophagy, a metabolic process that degrades damaged 
organelles and is associated with a wide variety of diseas
es.4
