Description:
Has lower thermal conductivity compared to monolayer graphene.

For decades it was thought that twodimensional crystals were 
not possible,1,2 until the successful preparation of monolayer 
graphene with mechanical exfoliation3 proved that twodimensional 
planar crystal structures could be isolated.46 These layers are not 
only stable but also exhibit remarkable physical and chemical 
properties not found in their parent materials.7,8 For example, the 
thermal conductivity of suspended monolayer graphene is as high 
as 5,000 WmK as measured by Raman spectroscopy, a value much 
higher than that of bulk diamond or graphite.9 Similarly, at room 
temperature, the carrier mobility in graphene can also reach much 
higher values of up to 15,000 cm2V1s1 and is less dependent on 
temperature than in its bulk counterpart.10 Because of these 
outstanding properties, graphene can be used in highspeed 
electronics,11 optical devices,12 chemical sensors,10,13 energy 
production and storage,12,14,15 and DNA sequencing16,17 among 
many other fields.
