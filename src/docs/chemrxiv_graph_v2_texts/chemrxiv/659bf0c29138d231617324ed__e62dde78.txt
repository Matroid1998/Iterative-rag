Description:
Materials with layered structures and an intrinsic band gap, suitable for low energy-consuming transistors.

The successful preparation of graphene led to a growing 
number of other twodimensional materials being reported.18 
Similar to graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have 
been studied for some time, with the structure of TMDs first 
reported by Linus and colleagues as early as 1923.19 By the 1960s, 
about 60 TMDs materials had been reported, of which at least 40 
exhibit layered structures,20 for example MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and 
WSe2, among others. These layered crystals not only have a 
thickness comparable to that of graphene, but additionally have an 
intrinsic band gap, which gives them the potential to be used in a 
new generation of small, low energyconsuming transistor 
materials.
