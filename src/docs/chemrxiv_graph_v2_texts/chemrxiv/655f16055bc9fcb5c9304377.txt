Description:
A substrate involved in hydroboration reactions.

Text:
The colourimetric indicator does inhibit the hydroboration reaction 
and shows no reactivity with substrates, HBpin, HBcat, nucleophilic species or any of the catalysts tested. This 
test is easily applied to all past and future catalysed hydroboration reactions and represents the first example of 
a colour indicator for hidden catalysis. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20230p4pb ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000186142947 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
