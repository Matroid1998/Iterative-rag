Description:
A precursor used in the ALD of GaN.

Text:
The surface chemistry for ALD of GaN from TMG has been extensively investigated using a 
variety of surface sensitive experimental and theoretical techniques5,9,10,11,12. In contrast, ALD of GaN from TEG has been less studied. Stegmuller et al,13 have presented a 
quantum chemical study on the gasphase decomposition pathways of TEG using density 
functional theory (DFT). They concluded that hydride elimination, i.e., replacing one ethyl 
ligand with a hydrogen on the gallium center while forming ethylene, is the dominant gas
phase decomposition pathway for TEG in a thermal CVD process. In surface chemistry studies 
with TEG, ethyl groups are found to deposit onto the surface by the decomposition of TEG, 
followed by desorption at higher temperatures as ethylene (C2H4) andor ethane (C2H6).
