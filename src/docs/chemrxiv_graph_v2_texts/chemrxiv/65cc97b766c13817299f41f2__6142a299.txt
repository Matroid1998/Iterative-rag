Description:
A family of compounds known for their red emission properties.

Text:
An alternate approach would be to utilize an 
inherent red emitter and with minimal functionalization on 
these molecules can be beneficial for harvesting their triplet 
excitons. In this direction, terrylene diimide (TDI), a pure red 
emitter of the rylene diimide (RDI) family with excellent thermal 
and photochemical stability can be a potential candidate.9 A few 
TDI derivatives have been shown to emit in the 600700 nm
