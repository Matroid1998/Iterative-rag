Description:
ROMP monomers with reactive side chains used to prepare functionalizable films.

Text:
Endfunctionalized polymers can also be used to prepare really novel block
copolymers by immobilizing the catalyst for a dierent type of polymerization than the
one used to prepare the rst chain. By synthesizing norbornenebased ROMP monomers
with reactive side chains, we have also prepared functionalizable lms where the polymer
side chain, rather than the end group, is modied. By incorporating active NHS esters
into the sidechain, groups aecting surface energy can be easily incorporated.
