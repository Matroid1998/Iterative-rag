Description:
Compounds subjected to mild hydrogenolysis for the synthesis of optically pure Î±(N-heterocyclic) propionic acids.

Text:
We solved this problem by mild hydrogenolysis of 
the corresponding dibenzyl esters,3a a reaction that was scaledup by Pfizer and applied for the 
asymmetric synthesis of optically pure a(Nheterocyclic) propionic acids.3c
