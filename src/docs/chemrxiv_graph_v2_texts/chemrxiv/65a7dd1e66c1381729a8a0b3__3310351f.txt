Description:
Liberated in a highly exergonic reaction to form a carbon-centered radical.

Text:
When activated, carboxy radicals are formed which rapidly 
liberate carbon dioxide in a highly exergonic reaction (23.2 kcal mol1), to 
form a carboncentered radical.4 This approach, when combined with metal 
catalysis, has enabled various new kinds of CC and CN bond formation 
reactions.5 A suitable activation method for carboxylic acids are hypervalent 
iodine(III) reagents, such as phenyliodo diacetate (PIDA), which are well 
known sources for aliphatic radicals6 and have been activated with 
photochemistry in chain reactions.7 On the one hand, singleelectron 
transfer (SET) or reduction of PIDA can occur from highly reducing excited 
state photocatalysts (PC, Figure 1).
