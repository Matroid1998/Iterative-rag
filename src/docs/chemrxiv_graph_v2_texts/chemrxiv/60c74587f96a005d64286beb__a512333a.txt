Description:
Formed by the extraction of a proton by a base, leading to an enol intermediate in aromatic nucleophilic substitution.

Clayden et al. published a methodology research of amino acid synthesis in Nature at

1(Fig.1). The rearrangement reaction (called Clayden rearrangement) in this process has 
an abnormal Hammet linear free energy relationship. The reaction constant  is significant 
smaller than the normal aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in electronrich area and 
it is minus in electrondeficiency area. Figure 1 General Formula of Clayden Rearrangement 

Clayden et al. demonstrated the existence of enol anions by experiments. The proton 
was extracted by the base to obtain an enol intermediate, then subjected to an aromatic 
nucleophilic substitution to obtain another anion intermediate. The product is obtained by 
work up.
