Description:
Known as Rare Earth Elements with applications in medicine, imaging, and high-tech industries.

Text:
Lanthanides, because of their unique properties, have a wide range of applications in several areas of 
medicine; 16 biology; 13 imaging techniques 14 such as computed tomography (CT) scans, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and Xrays; and hi
tech industries 710 such as in highstrength permanent magnets, superconductors, and electronic 
devices. Lanthanides are also known as Rare Earth Elements (REEs)  although formally REEs also 
include scandium and yttrium. Based on the atomic numbers, REEs can be divided into two categories 
light REEs (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and heavy REEs (Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y). Monazite, 
xenotime, bastnasite, etc. are naturally occurring REE sources containing up to 70 rare earth oxides 
(REOs).

Description:
Elements whose unusual oxidation states are stabilized by ionic liquids.

Text:
The ILs mainly consist of an organic cation (e.g., alkylimidazolium derivatives (MMI), Figure 
1) and an anionic counterpart (e.g., PF6 in Figure 1), and the proper selection of the cation and anion 
determine the hydrophilichydrophobic nature of the ILs. 26 The imidazoliumbased ILs with 
hydrophobic anionic counterparts, such as PF6 or (CF3SO2)2N, form distinct layers with water, which 
helps to separate the REEs from the parent materials via liquidliquid extraction. 18 Besides their use in 
extraction, ILs are now becoming important industrial substances because of their usefulness in nuclear 
fuel reprocessing. 27, 28 They solvate the uranyl complexes 29, 30 and stabilize the unusual oxidation 
states of lanthanides.
