Chemically synthesized oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos or ODNs) are typically purified with HPLC 
and gel electrophoresis. However, these methods have drawbacks such as the need of intense labor, and 
expensive or impossible to scale up. In addition, HPLC cannot purify oligos longer than 60mer, and gel 
electrophoresis also has limitations in cases where the target long oligos are in a complex mixture. Many 
efforts have been made to address one or more of these problems, and various alternative methods have 
been reported.
