Description:
Used as an electrolyte that increases the peroxo band.

In contrast to NiOOH, in NiOOH, both H2O 
and ions, including alkali metal cations, are intercalated.1921 With 
XAS, the intercalation of the cations was shown to be reversible 
when reducing the sample back to Ni(OH)2.21 Yet, the nuances 
of the phase transitions and structures are still a matter of 
debate.22,23 For instance, Garcia et al.24 have shown the 
formation of NiOO at 1.7 V vs. RHE with Raman spectroscopy. The peroxo band increases when using different electrolytes from 
LiOH to NaOH, KOH, and finally CsOH. In the same manner, the 
current density increased during the OER. They propose that the 
NiOOM species acts as an intermediate of the OER.
