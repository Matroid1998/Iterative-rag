Description:
Is abstracted from the polymer by free radicals during crosslinking.

In this, their ability to react simultaneously or 
sequentially by radical and condensation polymerization mechanism is of particular interest 24, 25. The common crosslinking mechanism of polymers with peroxide has three main steps 1) the 
primary radical formation from the thermal decomposition of peroxide; 2) hydrogen abstraction 
from the polymer by free radicals generated in step 1; and 3) the bimolecular radical recombination 
of polymer radicals from step 2 to generate covalent crosslinks 26. Here, we report on the thermal crosslinking of a hydrophilic polymer in its melt and the 
swelling properties of the obtained hydrophilic covalent networks. A commercially available high
