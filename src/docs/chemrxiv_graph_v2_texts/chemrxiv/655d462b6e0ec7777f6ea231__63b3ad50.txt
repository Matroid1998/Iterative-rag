However, the considerable energy demand and the availability of cheaper fossil 
fuels have slowed down the decarbonization process 5, 6. Consequently, alongside exploring 
other sustainable approaches to limit global temperature rise, the deployment of CCS on major 
point source emitters, particularly electricity generation, becomes imperative 7. The stateoftheart technology for carbon capture from point sources, commonly known as 
thermal amine scrubbing, involves nucleophilic solvents that absorb CO2 from flue gases followed 
by regeneration through the thermal swing process 79. Although amine absorbents offer high 
absorption capacity and fast kinetics for CO2 capture 1013, the thermal nature of the amine 
scrubbing process presents practical challenges when deployed commercially.
