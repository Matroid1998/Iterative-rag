Description:
Reacts with carbocations in chemical processes.

Text:
In this pro
cess, aryl radical additions to an alkene result in a homobenzylic rad
ical that either directly engages a chloride ion via group transfer or is 
oxidized to a carbocation, which reacts with the halide anion. Alt
hough several modifications have been made by Doyle6a, b, Nobile7, 
Grishchuck8 and others, Meerweintype arylchlorination still exhib
its limited compatibility with nonactivated alkenes. This drawback 
is often attributed to the slow addition of aryl radicals to the low po
larity carboncarbon double bond in nonactivated alkenes (106  
107 M1s1 vs 107  108 M1s1 for ,unsaturated alkenes)5b, 9 and that 
the intermediacy of a carbocation inevitably causes chemoselectivity 
issues via competing elimination10. Palladiumcatalyzed alkene arylchlorination methods have 
emerged as an effective means of synthesizing complex alkyl chlo
rides11.
