Description:
Used as a precursor for infiltrating Al2O3 into poly (methyl methacrylate) thin films.

Text:
In this respect, the understanding of the fundamental physico
chemical mechanisms governing the infiltration of SIS precursors and coreactants into the polymer 
matrix is very important to help with developing modelling tools for SIS, similar to the state of 
modelling of ALD,24,25 with predictive capabilities, that will support the community in the search for 
novel precursors and the establishment of proper infiltration protocols. Infiltration of Al2O3 into poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films using trimethyl 
aluminium (TMA) and H2O as precursors has been widely investigated and is commonly considered 
as a reference system in the scientific community.
