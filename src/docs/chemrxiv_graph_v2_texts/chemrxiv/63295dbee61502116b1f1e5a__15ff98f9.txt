Solidstate electrolytes for allsolidstate batteries (ASSBs) are intensively researched in recent 
years, due to the improved safety they offer compared to liquid electrolytes and because they 
may enable alternative electrodes1. In 2018, Asano et al.2 reported that the ternary halides 
Li3YCl6 and Li3YBr6 have ionic conductivities of 1 103 Scm and showcased ASSBs with 
coulombic efficiencies of 94 using (uncoated) LiCoO2 as the active material in the cathode 
composite. Since then, the material family Li3M(III)X6 (M(III) Y, In, Sc, Lanthanides; XCl, 
Br, I)) and other halide solid electrolytes have gained renewed interest in the scientific 
community due to their favorable combination of ionic conductivity (mScm) and 
highvoltage cathode compatibility. More recently, Zhou et al.3 reached a milestone in the 
development of ASSBs using a Li2InxSc0.66xCl4 electrolyte.

The ASSB with this electrolyte 
possessing a 2103 Scm ionic conductivity and a 4.71010 Scm electronic conductivity, 
reached 3000 cycles at 80 capacity retention when cycled between 2.8  4.3V vs. LiLi using 
LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2 as cathode (6.21 mgcm2) at 3C3. Considering these promising results, 
further improvements and fundamental understanding of such electrolytes may accelerate the 
development of practical ASSBs. A strategy that has been successfully employed to tune the ionic conductivity of Li3M(III)X6 
materials is halogen substitution49. Specifically for the compositional tieline between Li3YCl6 
and Li3YBr6, the Li3YBr3Cl3 composition was shown to have a 7.2 103 Scm ionic 
conductivity at room temperature (compared to the 1 103 Scm of the full 
Li3YCl6Li3YBr62). Based on thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculations it has been
