The use of siliconsubstituted alkenes and alkynes in 
radical cyclizations has, however, remained relatively 
underexplored. Due to the controllable lability of orga
nosilanes, the cyclic products of these reactions can un
dergo ringopening, which leads to an overall group 
transfer reaction of the vinyl or alkynyl substituent 
from silicon to carbon. Radical group transfer reactions 
of vinyl and alkynyl silanes have previously been per
formed using traditional radical initiators, e.g. on cyclic 
alkyl iodide substrates (Scheme 1b).1416 Following the 
radical cyclization reaction, addition of a fluoride source 
results in elimination and desilylation. A similar strate
gy has also been applied to activated, tertiary bro
mides,17 and in a radical cyclization cascade strategy to 
set multiple contiguous stereocenters.18
