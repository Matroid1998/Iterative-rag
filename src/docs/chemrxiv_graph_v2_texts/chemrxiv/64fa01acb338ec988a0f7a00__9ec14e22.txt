Description:
Used in MRI and X-ray scanning methods, and television screens.

Another
important class of materials is also introduced due to their advanced properties such as magnetic (Neodymium),
lighting (Lanthanum), Catalytic at high temperature (CeriumLanthanum), component of a exceptional sort of
glass (Praseodymium), visual displays in devices (Yttrium, terbium, europium), and (Gadolinium) is used in
MRI, and Xray scanning method, and as well as television screens. In addition, as shown here, this class of
elements named as rareearth materials might possess advanced features which would be exploitable for future
catalysistechnological composite materials engineering. Therefore, in this review article one focus is dedicated
to the novel development and application of hybrid materials made of rareearth in union with other materials. 2.
