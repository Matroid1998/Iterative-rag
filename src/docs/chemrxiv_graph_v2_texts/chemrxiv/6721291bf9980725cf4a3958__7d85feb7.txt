Description:
Has physical properties that rival those of lithium diisopropylamide.

Text:
We 
also discovered, however, that dynamic chemical exchanges created technical 
challenges beyond those observed for NaHMDS.2b 

In this second part, we describe the preparation, physical properties, 
spectroscopic studies, and reactivities of potentially useful silylated potassium 
amide basespotassium isopropyl(trimethylsilyl)amide (KPTA, 1)5 and potassium 
tertbutyl(trimethylsilyl)amide (KBTA, 2).5,6 Although KPTA and KBTA were 
known, they have little presence in organic chemistry5 and no presence in the 
synthetic organic chemistry literature. Studies of KPTA are a logical extension of 
the structure and reactivity studies of sodium isopropyl(trimethylsilyl)amide
