Description:
Acts as a hole scavenger in the photocatalytic HER process with MIL125(Ti) and NH2MIL125(Ti).

Text:
Interestingly, by comparing the effect of 
triethanolamine (TEOA) and of methanol (MeOH) as hole scavengers for the photocatalytic HER 
process with MIL125(Ti) and NH2MIL125(Ti), Eder and coworkers22 have shown that the charge 
stabilization on the amino group is not favourable to the hole scavenging by MeOH, while TEOA 
molecules degrade the MIL125(Ti). These works illustrate the complex interplay between the 
different and often competitive primary photophysical and photochemical processes governing the 
electronhole formation and reactivity in microporous photocatalysts. The properties of the excited 
states, the mode of energy transfer and of charge separation toward the metal centre vary finely with 
the nature and composition of the porous materials.
