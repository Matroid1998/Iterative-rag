Description:
A carbon-based material with distinctive structural and electronic properties, used in gas separation and optoelectronic devices.

Text:
Carbonbased materials such as graphene and graphynes (GYs) have garnered considerable 
interest as potential candidates for gas separation, energy storage materials, isotope separation, 
catalysis, water purification, and optoelectronic devices, owing to their distinctive structural 
and electronic properties.16 Numerous studies have shown that GYs, in particular, hold 
promise as electrode materials in lithiumion batteries.6, 7 GYs are carbon allotropes akin to 
graphene, first proposed by Baughman and coworkers in 1987.8 They can be theoretically 
derived from graphene by introducing acetylenic linkages (CC) between the CC bonds of 
graphene. GYs can be classified into various forms based on the arrangement and number of 
their acetylenic linkages. These include types like , , , and rhombicGY, as well as 
subclasses such as GY1, GY2, etc.

Additionally, the porous nature of GYs offers 
further opportunities to finetune their properties, enhancing their effectiveness as electrode 
materials in batteries.7 Studies have examined the trends in cation interactions and rattling 
motion between alkali and alkaline earth cations and various forms of GY, such as GY, 
GY, GY, rhombicGY, and compared the results with those of graphene.16 The binding 
strengths of various ions across the various GYs were observed in the order Mg2  Ca2  Li 
 Na  K. Additionally, GY and rhombicGY are found to exhibit selectivity for the passage 
of specific cations.
