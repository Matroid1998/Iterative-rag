Description:
Scaffolds act as halogen-chalcogen bond donors in anion binding and catalysis.

For example, 1,2,3triazoles have been applied as 
metabolicallystable bioisosteres for amides, esters, carboxylic 
acids, alkenes and other heterocycles;2 whilst their high hole 
affinity and Hbond donor properties have led to applications in 
electronics and anion recognition, respectively.3 
The immense range of applications of 1,2,3triazoles can be also 
attributed to the ease of their synthesis through the Nobel Prize 
winning Cucatalysed azidealkyne cycloaddition reaction.4 In 
contrast to the thermal Huisgen azidealkyne cycloaddition,5 the 
Cucatalysed variant provides excellent yield and regioselectivity 
for 1,4substituted triazoles, and can be performed at room 
temperature in a range of solvents, including water, allowing its 
use in bioconjugation applications.1c 
Bistriazoletriazolium scaffolds as halogenchalcogen bond 
donors in anion binding and catalysis have recently received 
significant attention and application.6 As part of an ongoing 
program into the design of new chalcogen bond donors, we 
were interested in the synthesis and functionalisation of related 
bistriazoles bearing electronwithdrawing Nsubstituents (Figure 
1A).
