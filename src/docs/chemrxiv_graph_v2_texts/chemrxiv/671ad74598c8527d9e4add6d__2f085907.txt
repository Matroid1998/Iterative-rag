Description:
The most energy dense class of NIB cathode materials.

Text:
Layered transition metal oxides (TMOs),
NaxTMO2 where TM is a transition metal, have emerged as the most energy dense class of NIB
cathode materials compared to Prussian bluewhite analogs and polyanions.7 The path to
achieving the highest energy density in TMOs should involve highvalent redox reactions (i.e.,
the over oxidation of TMs or oxygen).
