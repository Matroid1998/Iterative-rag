Lithium halides (LiX) are important additives in organometal
lic chemistry, serving as pivotal agents that can modulate the
reactivity and selectivity of organic reagents.1 The turbo Grig
nard reagent stands out as an emblematic example wherein the
addition of lithium chloride empowers the performance of the
organomagnesium species, enabling accelerated reaction rates,
enhanced selectivity, and improved sensitivity.2,3 In fact, the lit
erature indicates that LiX play a vital role in a multitude of chem
ical processes, establishing highyield stereoselective aldol reac
tions,49 enhancing the reducing strength of inorganic salts,1013
controlling polymer properties,1417 and improving permeation
and separation rates of polymeric membranes.1822 Moreover, LiX
constitute promising candidates for transition metalfree cathodes
in batteries.23,24
As research in this field continues to evolve, and the synergis
tic interplay between LiX and organic reagents promises to un
lock new pathways in chemical synthesis, it becomes essential
to gain a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of LiX.
