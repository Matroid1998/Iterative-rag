Description:
A hydrogel popularly used in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and cell proliferation.

Thus, combining 
PAM with silicone elastomer creates a multifunctional material PAM functions as an electrical 
conductor and silicone serves as a soft dielectric as well as provides mechanical support. This 
PAMsilicone hybrid material is utilized in fabricating soft ionic devices such as actuators, 
ionic skins, touchpads and so on 78. Similarly, poly(2hydroxyethyl methacrylate) 
(pHEMA) hydrogel popularly used in biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, drug 
delivery, cell proliferation and so on can also be integrated with siliconebased materials to 
create a novel material with improved features910. However, the inherent incompatibility 
between hydrogel and silicone limits their integration in many practical applications. Traditional bonding mechanisms are not straightforward and require complicated structural 
modifications of both materials, which may be undesirable for many applications.
