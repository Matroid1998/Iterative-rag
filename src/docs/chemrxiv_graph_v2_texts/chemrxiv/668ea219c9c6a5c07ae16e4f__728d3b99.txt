Nanozyme (17) is one of the promising nanomaterials that has successfully proved its potential 
32 
to replace natural enzymes, due to its intrinsic enzymelike catalytic activity. The advancement of 
33 
nanozymes has broadened their diversity, from inorganic nanoparticlebased nanozyme (2) to 
34 
engineered carbon structures (3), metalorganic frameworks (4), and singleatom nanozyme (5,6). 35 
Compared to  inorganic nanozyme (16), the concept of organic nanozyme has recently emerged 
36 
to address the chronic problems associated with inorganic nanozymes (7). Still, most organic 
37 
nanozyme contain significant amounts of inorganic portion within their framework because they 
38 
rely on this inorganic part to generate enzymelike catalytic performance (7).
