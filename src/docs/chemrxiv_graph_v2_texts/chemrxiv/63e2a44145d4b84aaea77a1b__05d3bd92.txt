Description:
Group III Lewis acids predicted to form dative bonds with MoS2.

Text:
Given the low reactivity of TMDs, one solution could be to em
ploy reagents that, upon adsorption on the surface of a pristine sheet,
would facilitate coordinate covalent (dative) bonding. In most cases,
this would imply the use of group III Lewis acids, especially since AlX3
(X  H, Cl, Br, and CH3) were predicted to form dative bonds with
MoS2 while in their monomer form 66. Nevertheless, the compounds
are known to dimerize via 3center 2electron bonds, and the interaction
could prove competitive with the dative bonding due to the conserva
tive binding energy of the latter. Thus, the dimerization could hamper
the enhanced adsorption. Furthermore, even if dative bonds form, they
were shown to have a limited impact on the molecules. However, with
