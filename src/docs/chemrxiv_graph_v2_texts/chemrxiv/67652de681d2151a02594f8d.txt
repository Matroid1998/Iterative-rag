Description:
Models expanded with Martini 28 for membrane-related applications.

Text:
With the release of Martini 28, it became possible not only to expand the library of 
phospholipid models9, but also to include new lipids such as sterols10 and glycolipids11, 
12, as well as proteins13, 14, nucleic acids15, 16, carbohydrates17, and other 
biomolecules18, 19. Over the years, Martini has been used in a wide range of 
membranerelated applications, including domain formation20, complex membrane 
compositions21, 22, membrane remodeling23, 24, proteinlipid interactions25, 26, and 
permeability27, 28. These studies have provided crucial insights into biological 
processes at the mesoscopic scale, bridging the gap between atomistic simulations 
and experimental observations and enabling insitu simulations of membranes in the 
context of a realistic cellular environment29, 30.
