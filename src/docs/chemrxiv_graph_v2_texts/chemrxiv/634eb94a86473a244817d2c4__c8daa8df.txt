Description:
The only FDA-approved AhR ligand for human application, used in psoriasis treatment.

Indolocarbazoles are highly valued functional scaffolds with extensive applications in biology and material sciences 
1. Illustrating examples are indolo3,2bcarbazole and 6formylindolo3,2bcarbazole (FICZ). They are 
endogenously formed within human tissues and serve as highaffinity ligands for the transcription factor Aryl 
hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) (Figure 1A) 2. AhR is a key regulator in xenobiotic metabolism and immunity, playing 
a fundamental role in several pathophysiological processes. Accordingly, manipulating AhR activity is considered 
as a promising therapeutic strategy for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, 
cancer, and viral infections 3. However, to date, the bacterial metabolite tapinarof is the only FDAapproved AhR 
ligand for the application in humans (psoriasis treatment, 2022) 4. AhRbased drug discovery faces several 
challenges.
