Description:
Exhibits enhanced conduction at ferroelectric domain walls due to local changes in band structure and point defects.

Text:
Ferroelectric domain walls (DW) are natural interfaces between
regions with uniform polarisation with a width at the unit
cell level. Enhanced conduction at ferroelectric DWs was first
demonstrated by spatially resolved conductance measurements
of BiFeO3
1. While local changes in the band structure and band
bending induced by DW bound charges2,3 were immediately rec
ognized as important, it was also early realized that point defects
play a crucial role for the transport behaviour of DWs1,411. Similar to the case of BiFeO3, point defects were associated
with the emergence of DW conduction in various systems, es
pecially at neutral DWs.
