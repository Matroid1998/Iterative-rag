Consequently, the quest for alternative strategies that circumvent these limitations while 
facilitating the construction of threedimensional molecular structures persists as an imperative in 
medicinal chemistry research.7 
In recent years, nickelmediated crosselectrophile (XEC) coupling has emerged as a potent strategy for 
constructing C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds, utilizing various native and benchstable aliphatic coupling entities, 
thus circumventing the use of moisturesensitive organometallic species.815 Despite substantial strides 
within this sphere, exploiting varied, ubiquitous functional groups such as aldehydes as coupling 
partners has lingered in a state of underdevelopment. Traditionally, aldehydes have been harnessed as 
carbonyl electrophiles with Mg or Libased organometallic species or within NozakiHiyamaKishi 
(NHK) type reactivity to yield alcohols,16,17 yet their employment to forge C(sp3)C(sp3) bonds via a 
reductive deoxygenative pathway remains, to our knowledge, uncharted.

Description:
Electrophiles that can undergo direct coupling with sp2 and sp3 electrophiles.

Text:
A pioneering approach, that 
enables the direct coupling of sp2 and sp3 electrophiles, such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids, heralds 
an unprecedented disconnection in the crosselectrophile coupling domain (Figure 1A). Aryl sulfonyl 
hydrazones are considered as a benchstable, activated form of aldehydes due to their known propensity 
to undergo both radical and polar addition, ultimately yielding deoxygenated, crosscoupled products 
upon thermal decomposition of alkylated hydrazide intermediates (Figure 1B).1827 Utilizing abundant 
aliphatic carboxylic acids activated as NHPIbased redoxactive esters (RAEs) to serve as sp3 
electrophiles, and employing visible lightmediated decarboxylation to yield carboncentered
