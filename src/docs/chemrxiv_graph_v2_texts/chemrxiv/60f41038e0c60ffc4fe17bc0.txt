Description:
Plays a central role in DNA photochemistry and is a hot spot in DNA photosensitization.

Text:
Thymine plays a central role in DNA photochemistry. Indeed, direct absorption of UVlight
leads to thymine dimerization, producing either cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) or 64
photoproduct (64PP) as the most common lesions.13 The former damages are also toxic
when they accumulate, as they are either repair resistant or highly mutagenic and are cor
related to the development of malignant skin cancers as the result of unprotected exposure
to sunlight.47 Furthermore, thymine is also an hot spot in DNA photosensitization.810. Indeed, its triplet state, the lowest among the natural nucleobases, can be populated via
triplettriplet energy transfer from the excited sensitizer. This process can also be facili
tated by the additional stabilization of thymine triplet (3T) due to stacking, and the
related multichromophoric coupling in the DNA helical structure.
