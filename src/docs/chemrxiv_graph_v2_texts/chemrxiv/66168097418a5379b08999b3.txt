Description:
Formed through hydrazone formation in dynamic combinatorial libraries.

Text:
Molecules in dynamic combinatorial libraries react with one 
another reversibly to form a network of library members.1 Such 
dynamic combinatorial chemistries generate a mixture of 
compounds that interconvert into one another. Processes like 
selfassembly,2 folding,3 or hybridization can displace the 
equilibria, leading to emergent phenomena like replication.4 For 
example, library members who assemble are thermodynamically 
favored and can thus be selected. Various dynamic covalent 
bonds have been explored to create dynamic combinatorial 
libraries, including metathesis,5 hydrazone formation,6 disulfide 
exchange,7 peptide bond formation, 8 or transamination9. Such 
dynamic combinatorial libraries serve as a great model for the 
cellular reaction networks, which are also dynamic combinatorial 
libraries. For example, building blocks like nucleotides or amino 
acids form a vast library of oligonucleotides and proteins.
