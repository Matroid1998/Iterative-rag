Description:
A fluorescent dye used for monitoring proton activity and undergoes tautomerization at a particular pH.

Text:
To monitor the proton activity in our cell, we used the fluorescent dye 
carboxyfluorescein (FAM). FAM allowed a calibration using an 
external titration that coincided with the proton concentration 
calculated using the Faradaic currents. We also calibrated the 
system using a special tautomerization process that FAM undergoes 
at a particular pH, and we used the proton quantification to control 
the acidity in acetonitrile (ACN). We used the fluorescence to 
calibrate the proton activity of acids in an organic electrolyte, 
observing the formation of superacids due to the influence of proton 
carrier salts in the electrolyte. Finally, we used our electrochemical 
cell for the deprotection of acid labile groups.
