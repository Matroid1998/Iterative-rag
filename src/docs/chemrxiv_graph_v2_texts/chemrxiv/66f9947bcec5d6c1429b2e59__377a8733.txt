Description:
A type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used as a fluorophore.

Text:
Organic fluorophores have attracted significant attention 
due to their broad range of applications in both solution and solid 
states. In solution, they are useful in chemical sensing, 1  
bioimaging, 2  photodynamic therapy (PDT), 3  and biomedical 
diagnostics 4  while in the solid state, these molecules are 
essential components in optoelectronic devices, including organic 
lightemitting diodes (OLEDs), 5  and organic lightemitting 
transistors (OLETs). 6  Among the most commonly employed 
fluorophores in solution are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), such as pyrene, perylene, rylene, and fluorescein.
