Description:
An aglycone component found in aminoglycosides that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the A-site in the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.

Text:
Aminoglycosides are an important class of antibiotics used in the treatment of several bacterial 
infections, particularly those caused by gramnegative strains1,2,3. These antibiotics are highly 
functionalized molecules derived from the glycolytic pathway and usually contain an 
aminocyclitol, including 2deoxystreptamine (2DOS), as aglycone4,5. These molecules inhibit 
protein synthesis by binding to the Asite in the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and interfering 
with the molecular basis of translation fidelity6. Gentamicin is one of the most functionalized 
aminoglycosides. The commercial form is a mixture containing 5 components, which have 
differences in the methylation level and stereochemistry of a methyl group at position C6 of their 
unusual sugar rings2.
