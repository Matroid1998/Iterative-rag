Twodimensional (2D) materials are a tantalizing area for 
material scientists because of their potential for nextgeneration 
electronics, sensing and photovoltaics.1 Creating large, defect
free 2D lattices  vital for the study of condensed matter  is 
nearly impossible. Graphene is a system that came close with its 
discovery in 2004 (Nobel prize 2010).2 This landmark 
achievement was the result of a topdown approach where 
simple exfoliation of graphite yielded a single layer of covalently 
linked, conjugated carbon atoms.2b However, graphene is not 
easily modified  chemical changes are randomly occurring, if 
they occur at all  and covalent buildup from smaller fragments 
remains challenging. A possible alternative are supramolecular 
approaches,3 where tailored fragments are made to assemble by 
weaker interaction forces than the carboncarbon bond.
