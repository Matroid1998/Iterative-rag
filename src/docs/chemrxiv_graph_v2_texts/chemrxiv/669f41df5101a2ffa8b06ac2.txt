Description:
Contains bulky amino groups that alter the geometry of DNA grooves in GC-rich regions.

Text:
Sequence specificity is a major clause in drugDNA 
interactions. It has been observed that, minor groove binding drugs show selectivity towards AT 
rich region, several factors are also responsible for this first is electrostatic potential of ATrich 
region is higher than that of GCfilled ones and the second one is that the ATrich grooves are 
narrower and deeper than GC ones and thus allowing better binding and interactions. Minor groove 
of the DNA has alternating A and T bases which allows van der Waals contacts between the drug 
and DNA however no such contact is observed in GCrich regions because the geometry of groove 
is altered by bulky amino groups of guanine bases.
