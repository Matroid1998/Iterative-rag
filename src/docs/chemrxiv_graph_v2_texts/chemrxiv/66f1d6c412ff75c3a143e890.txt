Description:
An adsorbate whose adsorption energy is linearly related to the free formation energies of intermediates and transition states.

Text:
4 previously demonstrated that there is a linear relationship between the adsorption
energies of two similar adsorbates (e.g. O vs. OH, N vs. NHx, C vs. CHx and S vs. SH) on the same adsorption site on
dierent surfaces. The adsorption energy is also linearly related to the free formation energies of intermediates and
transition states 5. Based on the above characteristics, with descriptorbased microkinetic modeling, the adsorption
energy can be used as a descriptor to predict the reactivity of the catalyst 5, 6. The adsorption energy (Ead ) can be
calculated using ab initio quantum chemical methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) 7. However, these
methods are computationally expensive, making searching for potential candidates in a vast design space a daunting
task 8.
