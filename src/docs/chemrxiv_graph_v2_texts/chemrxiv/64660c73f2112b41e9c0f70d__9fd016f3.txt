Description:
Amphiphilic and self-assembles in aqueous solutions, interacting with lipid membranes and hydrophobic cavities of cyclodextrins or proteins.

Text:
Metallacarboranes are versatile platforms commonly used to develop bioactive compounds with 
potential therapeutic applications. 1,2 Their unusual cagelike structure enables us to arrange 
substituents and tailor molecular targets. 35 Additionally, metallacarboranes can induce favorable 
interactions with biomolecules through hydrogen and dihydrogen bonding, 6,7 ionpairing, 8,9 
hydrophobic interactions, 
3,5,7 and chaotropic effects. 10 Among metallacarboranes, cobalt 
bis(dicarbollide) (COSAN) stands out for its properties. 11 
Amphiphilic COSAN selfassembles in aqueous solutions1217 and interacts with lipid membranes10,1822 
and hydrophobic cavities of cyclodextrins or proteins. 3,5,10,23 COSAN can also cross cell membranes and 
accumulate intracellularly, including in the cell nucleus. 18,19,21 Furthermore, 3D aromaticity24,25 and a 
single negative charge delocalized over 23 atoms26 explain the exceptional thermal, chemical, and 
biological stability of this abiotic compound.
