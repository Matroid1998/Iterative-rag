Description:
Molecules with rotational units that result in unidirectional tilting and propellerlike chirality.

Text:
For noncage molecules with rotational units such as triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives,
as studied by Kim et al.,16 the rotations of the aromatic rings are coupled, resulting in
unidirectional tilting of the rotational units and propellerlike chirality of the molecule
alone (Fig. 1(a)). These TPA derivative molecules therefore have two isomers with (P)
or (M)propeller chirality that aggregate to form supramolecular helices with one chirality
(Fig. 1(b)). This use of supramolecular interactions in the selfassembly of the molecules is
able to lock in the chirality of the molecules. Similarly, symmetric, achiral cages have been
known to crystallise with asymmetric, chiral cavities.17,18 Here, the cages can adopt multiple
different conformers, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggesting that the
most stable conformer is achiral.
