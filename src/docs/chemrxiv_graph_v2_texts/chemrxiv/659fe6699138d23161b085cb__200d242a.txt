Description:
A well-known and frequently used additive in electrolyte formulations for lithium-ion batteries.

Text:
Lithiumion batteries have become a ubiquitously used electrochemical energy storage method 
in portable electronics and vehicles1. However, the extension of cycle and calendar life are of 
high interest for established and nextgeneration chemistries24. To further improve the cell 
performance and lifetime5, electrolyte additives are typically used. Fluoroethylene carbonate 
(FEC)6 and Vinylene carbonate (VC)7 are the two most wellknown, most frequently used, and 
most studied additives in electrolyte formulations. Many studies have demonstrated that the 
addition of FEC predominantly contributes to an improved cycle stability of the cells by 
facilitating the formation of a robust and uniform SEI film on the cathode material6,8,9. On the
