Description:
Involved in dehydrogenation reactions.

Text:
There is precedent for ELC chemistry between aluminum and HX bonds (Scheme 1). The Berben group has shown that their bis(imino)pyridine aluminum hydride complex (PhI2P2
)AlH) undergoes ELC chemistry with select anilines6 and alcohols7 to form the (PhHI2P1)Al(X)H 
complexes, where X represents an alkoxo or amido ligand that is installed at the metal ion while 
the ligand is protonated. They have advanced this chemistry to develop catalytic systems for the 
dehydrocoupling of amines6, the dehydrogenation of formic acid8, and carbonyl transfer 
hydrogenation.9
