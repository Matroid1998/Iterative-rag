Description:
Used in reduction of activated olefins.

Ringdisubstituted propyl esters of 2cyano3phenyl2propenoic acid (PCPP), 
RPhCHC(CN)CO2C3H7 continue to attract attention as compounds with interesting 
properties and as comonomers for modification of commercial polymers. Similar structure 
to 2fluoro5methyl PCPP was reported in stereoselective cascade assembling of 
benzylidenecyanoacetates and 1,3dimethylbarbituric acid into (1R,2S)1cyano5,7
dialkyl4,6,8trioxo2aryl5,7diazaspiro2.5octane1carboxylates 1, as well as in 
synthesis and application of polysiloxanesupported NAD(P)H model 1Benzyl1,4
dihydronicotinamide in the reduction of activated olefins 2. 4Iodo ringsubstituted PCPP 
was involved in selective hydrolysis of 1cyanocyclopropane1carboxylates leading to 
concise preparation of 1carbamoylcyclopropane1carboxylates 3, in reaction of 
indandione with ethyl cyanoarylacrylates 4, and in basefree Knoevenagel 
condensation catalyzed by copper metal surfaces 5. 2Iodophenyl derivative was used in 
preparation of 1carbamoylcyclopropane1carboxylates via selective hydrolysis of 1
