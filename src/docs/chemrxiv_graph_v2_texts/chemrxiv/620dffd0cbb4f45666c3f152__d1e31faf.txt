Description:
Forms hypervalent compounds with transferable substituents such as halides, esters, cyanides, CF3 groups, or azides.

Text:
Benziodoxol(on)es (BX) motifs also allow the stabilization of a large range of other transferable 
substituents at the hypervalent iodine atom such as halides,12 esters,13 cyanides,14 CF3
groups15 or azides.16 Intrinsically, BXbased iodanes allow only a limited chemical variation 
to modify and finetune the reactivity of these substituents in umpolung reactions. However, 
the oxygen atom itself can be substituted by other heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen.17
