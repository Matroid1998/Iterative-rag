Description:
A MOF material with relatively high BET surface areas of 3800 m2/g.

Text:
A clear illustration of this can be seen 
with the MOF5 (Zn4O(bdc)3; bdc2  benzene1,4dicarboxylate) material, which exhibits relatively high 
surface areas (BET surface areas of 3800 m2g) among MOFs17a and was the first MOF that was studied
