Description:
Cations where X can be F, Cl, Br, or I, studied for charge migration.

Text:
In the 
present computational study, we examine the ground and excited states of a series of haloacetylene cations, 
HCCX (X  F, Cl, Br, I), in preparation for future studies on the formation of coherent superpositions and 
the simulation of charge migration in these systems. Charge migration in HCCI has been studied extensively, both experimentally and computationally.4, 
1016 Strong field ionization of HCCI produces a coherent superposition of the X and A states of HCCI.4 
This results in charge migration between the CC triple bond and the iodine with a period of 1.87 fs.

Description:
Challenges in electronic structure calculations due to same electronic state symmetry of X and A states.

Text:
The 
coherent superposition and charge migration decay in 15  20 fs because the vibrational wavepackets on 
the X and A potential energy surfaces move in opposite directions.1215 Charge migration has also been 
studied in a number of other systems, including some closely related molecules, HCCBr, H(CC)nBr and 
H(CC)nI cations,1719 but not in HCCCl and HCCF. One of the challenges for calculating the electronic structure of HCCX cations is that the X and A states 
have the same electronic state symmetry. Consequently, calculations of the A state with conventional 
density functional methods and single reference correlated wavefunctions such as coupled clusters (CC) 
would collapse to the X state.
