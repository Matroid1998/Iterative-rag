Products of conversion from quinones.

In contrast, the synthesis of 1,2,5,6 and 1,4,5,8anthracenetetrone (Scheme 1, bottom) is 
more challenging.912 This may explain why these compounds are less investigated despite 
the large number of available reactions for converting quinones, including our new 
conversion into cyanoarenes (demonstrated for 5,7,12,14pentacenetetrone and a range of 
other para and orthoquinones).1316 Beside other syntheses, the two tetrones are particularly 
interesting for the synthesis of conjugated small molecules and polymers, but they have 
been used in only a few reactions so far
