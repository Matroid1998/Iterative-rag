role in, and transcription factors that play crucial role in cell functioning.1 In addition, it plays,it 
plays a vital role in DNA synthesis, cell division, immune, wound healing, and cell signaling. A 
lower zinc concentration functioning causes impaired cell functioning causes impaired cell 
functioning, and a high concentration may result in toxicity inside cells, degeneration of neurons, 
and diabetes.1 Therefore, maintaining an appropriate amount of zinc inside the cell is very 
important.
