Produced from water and sunlight through photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Text:
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been considered as a promising approach for 
producing renewable hydrogen from water and sunlight.1 To realize scalable hydrogen 
production with this approach, it is crucial to develop simple methods for the preparation of 
costeffective semiconducting materials.
