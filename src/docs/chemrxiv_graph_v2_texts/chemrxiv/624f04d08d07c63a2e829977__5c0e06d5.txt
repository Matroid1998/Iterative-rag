Text:
Fluoro ringsubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylates (EPCA) were reported in synthesis and 
characterization of a crownshaped 36molybdate cluster related to catalysis of Knoevenagel 
condensation 1; in preparation of bicyclic pyridine derivatives as fatty acid binding protein 
inhibitors 2; in use of aminefunctional polysiloxanes as efficient polymeric organocatalyst 
for amino catalysis in multicomponent Gewald reaction, allylic alkylation of aldehydes, 
and Knoevenagel condensation 3; in synthesis and application of polystyrenesupported 
NADH model 4; in preparation of heterocyclic compounds as xanthine oxidase inhibitors 
5; in total synthesis and study of analgesic activity of 6fluoroindan1carboxylic acid 6; 
in design, synthesis and application of polysiloxanesupported NADH model 7; in 
investigation into the oxidation mechanism of Hantzsch 1,4dihydropyridines by ethyl 
cyanocinnamates and benzylidenemalononitriles 8; in stereoselective synthesis of trans4,
5substituted 1,4,5,6tetrahydropyridine2(olates)thiolates 9; in studies stereochemistry of 
interaction of pyridinium ylides with ,unsaturated nitriles 10; in synthesis of condensed 
2amino4Hpyrans and characterization molecular structure of 2amino7,7dimethyl4(3
