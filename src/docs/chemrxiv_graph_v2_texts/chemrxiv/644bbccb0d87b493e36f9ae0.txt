Description:
When conjugated with one ligand, the BAI barrier drops to 55 kJ mol1 in thionylimide.

Text:
Nitrogen BAI (85
125 kJ mol1)7, 8 and rotation around CN bond (210250 kJ mol1 barrier for photoinduced 
rotation9, 10) provide alternative concerted mechanism for (EZ) stereoisomerization in 
imine C(R1R2)N(R3) 3. When nitrogen is merely conjugated with one of ligands, the BAI 
barrier drops to 55 kJ mol1 in thionylimide HNSO 411. When nitrogen is conjugated with 
both ligands, the SNS inversion requires exceptionally low energy (5  30 kJ mol1) in
