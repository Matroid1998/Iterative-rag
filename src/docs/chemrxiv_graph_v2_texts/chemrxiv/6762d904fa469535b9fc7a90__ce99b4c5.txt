Description:
A photoactive material used in enzymatic biohybrid PEC devices.

These components are not only expensive11, but are also often non
innocent as they can be easily oxidised at low overpotentials by the photoanode12, which precludes 
the coupling of fuel production with stoichiometric O2 evolution. Moreover, existing enzymatic 
biohybrid PEC devices are based on photoactive materials such as silicon10,13, perovskite6,7 and Cu
chalcogenide14, often limited by either insufficient photovoltages for constructing biasfree devices, 
moisture degradation, material toxicity or high costs. Organic semiconductors (OSCs) composed of earthabundant elements are promising 
biocompatible materials for assembling lightdriven enzymatic biohybrid systems. Solution 
processable conjugated OSCs exhibit bandgap tuneability at the molecular level15,16, and the bulk 
heterojunction (BHJ) design supported by a builtin electric field for organic photovoltaic (OPV) 
applications facilitates efficient charge separation at the nanoscale.
