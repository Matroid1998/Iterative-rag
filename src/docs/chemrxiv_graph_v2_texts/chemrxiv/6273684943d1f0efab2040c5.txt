Description:
Involved in transport resistance and starvation in PEMFCs.

Text:
Several studies have been conducted to solve the challenges of commercializing PEMFCs. Thermal 
management 2, water management 3, and oxygen transport resistance 4 account for the majority 
of investigations. The operating conditions of PEMFC 5, its flow field 6, and the optimization of 
properties of cells 5 have all been investigated. Modified catalysts 7, the properties of the Gas 
Diffusion Layer (GDL) 8, the clamping pressure of cells 9, degradation 10, hydrogen economy 
11 were also studied. The investigations unveiled the behaviour of PEMFC at different conditions. In high current densities, PEMFCs suffer from concentration loss or, in other words, oxygen starvation 
12. Some studies focused on the transport of oxygen 4,1218.
