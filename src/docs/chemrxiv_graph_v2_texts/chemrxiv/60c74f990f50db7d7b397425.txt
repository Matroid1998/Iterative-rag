Description:
A nonluminescent radical.

Text:
In nature, noncovalent interaction and selfassembly are playing a critical role in 
photophysical properties.22,23 Modern photophysics suggests that in addition to the intrinsic 
energy states of chromophores, their luminescent properties could be affected or even reversed 
by the surrounding24,25. Here, we report that TEMPO, a nonluminescent radical5, could be
