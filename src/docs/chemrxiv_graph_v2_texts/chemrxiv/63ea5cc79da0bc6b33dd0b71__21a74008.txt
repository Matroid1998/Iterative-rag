Description:
A side chain in poly(4 (thiophene3yl)benzenethiol) that copolymerizes with sulfur to form a crosslinked organosulfur polymer.

This reaction allows lithiumsulfur batteries to store more energy per
unit weight than lithiumion batteries, making them an attractive option for a wide range of
applications.4,5 However, despite their potential advantages, LiS batteries have faced several
challenges in terms of their performance and stability, such as the insulating nature of the
elemental sulfur6 and the shuttle effect of dissolvable lithium polysulfides.7
Conjugated polymers is a class of polymeric materials that exhibits alternating single and
double bonds in their main chain, which gives them unique electrical, optical, and mechanical
properties.811 In the context of LiS batteries, conjugated polymers can be used as cathode
material to improve the electrical conductivity of the sulfur cathode and to prevent the dis
solution of the active materials by forming strong chemical bonds with sulfur.1218 Among
these, thiolcontaining polymers are one example where the SH groups can be crosslinked
with sulfur via covalent bonding.1921
In a recent study, we presented a new fabrication strategy to construct a binder and carbon
additivefree organosulfur cathode based on a thiolcontaining conducting polymer poly(4
(thiophene3yl)benzenethiol) (PTBT).21 The PTBT features the polythiophene main chain
as a highly conducting framework and the benzenethiol side chain to copolymerize22,23 with
sulfur and form a crosslinked organosulfur polymer.
