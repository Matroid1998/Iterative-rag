Description:
Involved in thiolene polymerizations and thiol-mediated Michael-type additions.

Systems with reaction rates that are tunable by small changes 
in pH, temperature, or buffer concentration are particularly interesting because they can be 
adapted to facilitate handling in different processing scenarios. Ideally, the crosslinking reaction 
should also be bioorthogonal, render stable bonds in physiological millieau and use cost
effective precursors. The most popular covalent crosslinking strategies are radicalmediated 
acrylic2 and thiolene3 polymerizations, Schiffbase formation,4 cycloadditions5, and thiol
mediated Michaeltype additions, which exhibit some but not all of these desirable features.6 
Developing a crosslinking platform that brings all the favorable characteristics together remains 
a challenge and motivates researchers to expand the present chemical toolkit.
