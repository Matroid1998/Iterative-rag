Description:
Converted into long-term stable, storable products via a thermodynamically uphill electrochemical reaction.

Text:
Here, solar light is used directly or indirectly by an artificial,
lightabsorbing structure to convert CO2 into longterm stable, storable products via a ther

modynamically uphill electrochemical reaction. This allows in principle for much higher
efficiencies than natural photosynthesis, thus drastically reducing the landfootprint of this
