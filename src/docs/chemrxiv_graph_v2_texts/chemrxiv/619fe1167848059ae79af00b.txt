Description:
Undergoes intercalation with bulk crystalline V2O5, causing phase transformations.

This is an advantage over 
other methods which often require further processing, e.g. the use of binders and conductive 
polymer pastes22 to form an electrical contact and improve the adhesion of the particles to the 
collector surface. During Li intercalation, bulk crystalline V2O5 undergoes a sequence of transformations with 
the phases         , each accommodating an increasing number of intercalated 
ions.23, 24 In the absence of Li, the starting, phase V2O5 structure is comprised of chains of
