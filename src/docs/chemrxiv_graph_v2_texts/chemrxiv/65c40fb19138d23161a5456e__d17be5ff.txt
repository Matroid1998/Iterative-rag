Methane emissions mitigation is a critical element of the global transition to a low carbon future.1

3 As the major component of natural gas, methanes global warming potential (GWP) is 84  87 
38 
times that of carbon dioxide over a 20year time scale.4 Curbing methane emission is an effective 
39 
strategy to reduce near term climate warming, thus allowing a longer time frame to reduce carbon 
40 
dioxide emissions.5 The oil and natural gas (OG) sector is the largest industrial source of methane 
41 
emissions in the United States, contributing approximately 29 of total methane emissions in 
42 
2021.6 In November 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed updated rules for 
43 
methane emissions reduction from the OG industry.7 Additionally, starting in 2024, the Inflation 
44 
Reduction Act (IRA) will impose a methane charge on emissions above certain threshold at OG 
45 
facilities.8 Thus, accurate quantification of methane emissions is important for effective policy 
46 
implementation.
