Description:
Facilitates peptide cyclisation with a chloroacetyl group following translation.

4CNW and AzAla into cyclic peptides by ribosomal translation. We 
selected the flexible in vitro translation system (FIT), which uses 
Flexizymes (small flexible tRNA acylation ribozymes) to prepare non
proteinogenic 
acyltRNAs 
using 
chemically 
activated 
amino 
acids.10,11 
In a typical RaPID selection, the initiator is reprogrammed with an N
chloroacetylated amino acid, that readily undergoes peptide 
cyclisation with a downstream cysteine after in vitro translation of the 
linear peptide.1113 We designed compounds ClAc4CNWCME 7 and 
ClAcAzAlaCME 8 to explore the inclusion of fluorescent amino acids 
into in vitro translated cyclic peptides via initiator reprogramming. The 
chloroacetyl (ClAc) group facilitates peptide cyclisation with a cysteine 
residue following translation, and the cyanomethyl ester (CME) acts 
as an efficient leaving group for flexizymemediated tRNA charging.
