Description:
A derivative formed under conditions similar to those yielding CB9H9I1.

of a BO bond.20 As the 
Suzuki coupling requires a base, we did not expect the formation of a BO bond, and 
even traces of such a derivative were not visible in mass spectrometry. This is in 
contrast to the CB9H9I1 cluster, which under similar conditions yields CB9H9OH1.21 
Also, the formation of B12H11OH2, which we had observed when no other coupling 
partner was present,22 was not detected here. Thus, we have been able to establish conditions under which one can attach any 
carbon compound to a B atom on dodecaborate, with boronic acids that have strongly 
electronwithdrawing groups, as well as strongly electrondonating groups, and thereby 
spanning the whole spectrum of functional groups, as detailed in Table 1.
