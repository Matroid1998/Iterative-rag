Description:
Clean burning oxygenated fuels produced from various feedstocks such as soybean, mustard, rapeseed, palm, and sunflower oil.

Indian transport sector emitted 258.10 million tonnes of 
CO2 in 20032004 and road transport contributed 94.5 of the total transport emissions 2. A switch towards environment friendly alternative fuels will solve the problem of growing 
concern about climate change, and energy security. Commercially available alternative fuels 
are biodiesel, bioethanol, and electricity. Biodiesel are clean burning monoalkyl ester based 
oxygenated fuels produced from various feedstocks such as soybean, mustard, rapeseed, palm, 
and sunflower oil in many parts of the world (Agarwal 2007). However, for country like India, 
food security is the prime concern and India imports 4050 of the vegetable oil for domestic 
needs, so most of these options are not viable in Indian scenario 3.
