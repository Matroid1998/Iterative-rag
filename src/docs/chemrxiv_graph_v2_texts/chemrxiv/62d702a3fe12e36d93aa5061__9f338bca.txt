Description:
Involved in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and utilisation (CCU) technologies.

At the heart of these issues is the uncontrolled leakage of chemicals to the environment, via 
GHG emissions to the air and products to land, waterways and marine environments (15, 1922). This leakage has adverse effects on climate, biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health. Safeguarding planetary boundaries requires a transition towards more sustainable production and 
consumption of chemicals, where leakage is eliminated or made harmless to the environment and 
emissions are reduced across all lifecycle stages (23). Yet, the road ahead for chemicals is divided. The industrys preferred pathways to netzero is to 
retrofit current chemical facilities with supplybased emissions mitigation solutions, while 
leaving demand for chemicals unconstrained. Supplyside technology options include carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) and utilisation (CCU), biobasedgreen hydrogenbased feedstocks, 
direct air capture (DAC), and electrification.
