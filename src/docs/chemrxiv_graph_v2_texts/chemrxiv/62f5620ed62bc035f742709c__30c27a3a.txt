Description:
Radicals that have been largely overlooked for the construction of CC bonds.

Although these boroncen
tered radicals have attracted mainly interest from the syn
thetic community as nucleophilic radicals,13,14 they have 
also been used in the role of halogenatom transfer (XAT) 
agents. In the latter scenario, the halogenaffinity of the LBR 
is exploited for the homolytic activation of a CX bond to 
yield carboncentered radicals. However, this manifold has 
been so far only used to reduce CX bonds into the corre
sponding CH bond via a radical chain mechanism.11,12,15 
Surprisingly, boryl radicals have been largely overlooked 
for the construction of CC bonds (Figure 1B).

Description:
Forms a pivotal ligated radical for CC bond formation.

Text:
In an early example, the radical silyldifluoromethylation 
of electrondeficient alkenes was reported.16 Herein, a very 
specific interaction, based on halogen bonding between the 
substrate and an NHC borane, was needed to trigger the de
sired CX bond photolysis and subsequently initiate the 
radical chain mechanism sustained by the LBR (Figure 1C). Inspired by this report, we questioned whether it would be 
possible to realize a more general strategy to generate the 
pivotal ligated boryl radical. Such a pathway might allow the 
engagement of a broader array of substrates, ultimately 
leading to a general approach for CC bond formation.
