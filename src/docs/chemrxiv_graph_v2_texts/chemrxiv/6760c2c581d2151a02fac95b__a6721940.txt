Ferrocene (dicyclopentadienyl iron (5, FeCp2 or Fc)), discovered in 1951, has since become a 
42 
cornerstone in organometallic chemistry due to its unique sandwich structure, which features a 
43 
central iron atom coordinated between two cyclopentadienyl rings. This unprecedented 
44 
configuration not only expanded the understanding of bonding in transition metal complexes but 
45 
also led to significant advancements in the field of organometallics, earning Geoffrey Wilkinson 
46 
and Ernst Otto Fischer the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973.

Text:
Over the decades, ferrocene has 
47 
garnered attention for its remarkable stability, thermal resistance, and redox properties, making it 
48 
an attractive scaffold for chemical modifications.1 Of particular importance is its role in catalysis, 
49 
where chiral ferrocene ligands have demonstrated exceptional enantioselectivity in various 
50 
asymmetric catalytic reactions, including hydrogenation, carboncarbon bond formation, and 
51 
hydrosilylation.2 These ligands have become indispensable in both academic research and 
52 
industrial applications, especially in the production of optically pure compounds, underscoring 
53 
the broad utility of ferrocene in the development of novel catalytic systems.
