Carmofur and its analogs have been previously synthesized from 5fluorouracil with phosgene 
60 
and hexylamine in pyridine, or through direct nucleophilic addition of 5fluorouracil to nhexyl 
61 
isocyanate in pyridine12,13 (Fig. 2). However, previously recorded synthetic procedures have 
62 
suffered from low yields and inefficient reaction times5,6. Additionally, due to the limited 
63 
solubility of 5fluorouracil in most organic solvents, this reaction must be performed in 
64 
exceptionally polar, nonvolatile solvents such as pyridine, making it inconvenient to monitor by 
65 
thinlayer chromatography14. Serendipitously, carmofurs fluorine atom serves as a spectroscopic 
66 
handle for reaction monitoring by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
