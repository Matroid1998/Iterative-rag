Description:
Undergoes conversion at the cathode in SOERs to form CO and O2.

Text:
In SOERs, 
3 
CO2 conversion occurs at the cathode (CO2  2e  CO  O2)1820 while propylene, a highvalue chemical, 
4 
is produced from inexpensive propane at the anode (C3H8  O2  C3H6  H2O  2e).3,11,13 The overall 
5 
electrochemical reaction, using excess renewable electricity in the SOER (C3H8  CO2  C3H6  CO  H2O 
6 
in Figure 1A), presents a compelling opportunity to merge environmental sustainability with economic 
7 
viability, thereby accelerating the transition to a carbonneutral future. 8 
The concurrent CO2 recycling and propylene production via SOERs, however, faces several challenges.

Description:
Has a higher dissociation energy barrier and undergoes a multielectron process during reduction to CO.

Text:
9 
The reduction of CO2 to CO occurs at a slower rate than water splitting for hydrogen due to its multielectron 
0 
process and higher dissociation energy barrier.19 In the anode side, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane 
1 
is hindered by several factors21,22 the strength of CH bonds in propane, the relative instability of propylene

compared to propane, excess oxidation of propane to CO2, catalyst degradation under oxidative conditions,
