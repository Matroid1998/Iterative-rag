Description:
Undergo condensation with amines to form amides.

Text:
The formation of the amide bond is of utmost importance in chemical synthesis. Amidebased 
compounds find their application in pharmaceuticals,1 agrochemicals,2 polymers,3 etc. For 
example, around a quarter of marketed drugs contain an amide bond,1 and amide coupling is 
the most prevalent chemical transformation in drug discovery.4 At the same time, academic 
and industrial researchers call for improvement in the sustainability of chemical processes that 

lead to amides as a top priority,5 in line with the principles of green chemistry and sustainable 
development.6 Among different strategies for the preparation of amides, the most 
straightforward is the amidation of carboxylic acids and amines (Figure 1). Their condensation 
using coupling reagents is the goto approach for the largescale preparation of amides.7 
However, such an approach suffers from considerable sustainability drawbacks.

Description:
Activated by coupling reagents to make the carbonyl group more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Text:
In the 
activation step, stoichiometric amounts of coupling reagents are used to activate the carboxylic 
acids, thus making the carbonyl group more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack from the 
amine molecules. Although highly efficient, this approach yields large amounts of solvent 
waste and poor atom economy. Alternatively, solutionbased direct catalysed amidation 
protocols with the frequently used boron810 and group (IV) metal catalysts1114 are more 
favourable from the green chemistry perspective. Yet, catalysed amidations still face a few 
challenges, for example, problems with catalyst loadings and recyclability as well as limited 
substrate scopes, not to mention that such reactions remain developed in solution, which does 
not help to reduce waste production.15
