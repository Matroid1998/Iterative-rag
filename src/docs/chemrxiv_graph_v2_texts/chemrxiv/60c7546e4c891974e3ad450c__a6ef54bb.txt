Chain-end functionalized oligomers obtained from NR and vulcanized NR based products.

In the last years, efforts to reclaiming2,3 and to chemically 
recycle NR based products emerged as a potentially more sustainable use of the resource.4,5 In 
particular, Cross Metathesis (CM) based methods are considered a promising way for 
converting NR waste into feedstock for the chemical industry.6,7 Various protocols for 
obtaining chainend functionalized oligomeric 1,4cisisoprenes from NR and in further course 
also from (vulcanized) NR based products were disclosed in the past.8,9,10,11,12,13 We 
contributed to these endeavors by demonstrating the potential of electron deficient olefins, 
namely acrylates, as CMpartners in the degradation of NR based goods. The reaction allows 
for the preparation of oligomers containing ,unsaturated ester moieties as one endgroup, 
which was used for a subsequent 42 cycloaddition with cyclopentadiene.

Description:
Semitelechelic oligomeric compounds containing unsaturated ester endgroups.

Text:
Ringopening 
metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the resulting norbornene bearing oligomers finally 
yielded polymers with similar thermal characteristics as natural rubber (Fig. 1).14 Based on 
these results, we herein strive for exploring further applications of semitelechelic oligomeric 
1,4cisisoprenes containing ,unsaturated ester endgroups. Specifically, we aim at 
saponification of the ester group. We hypothesized that amphiphilic molecules with a low 
hydrophiliclipophilic balance (HLB) suited for stabilization of high internal phase emulsions 
(HIPEs) might be accessible by this approach.
