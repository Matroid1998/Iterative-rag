Description:
Products of transformations involving the nitrile moiety.

Text:
The nitrile moiety, a cornerstone of modern organic chemistry and material science, is integral 
to natural products, pharmaceuticals and synthetic intermediates due to its exceptional 
versatility and reactivity.16 It serves as a key synthetic handle for transformations into 
carboxylic acids, amines, and aldehydes, while also enhancing reactivity at neighboring sites 
of molecules.79 The hydrocyanation of readily available alkynes represents a straightforward
