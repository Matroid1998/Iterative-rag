Undergoes decomposition reactions.

This approach has been
used to study hydrocarbon pyrolysis 1015, hydrogen
combustion 16, methane oxidation 17, and hydrogen
peroxide decomposition 18. However, this method can
only be applied above a certain temperature, where the
equilibration time is considered reasonably small to be
run in an MD simulation. As some applications may need
simulations that reach equilibrium at lower temperatures,
there is a need for a method to accurately simulate the
evolution of the system in these conditions. In this work, we present a way to overcome the
timescales limitation occurring at low temperatures.
