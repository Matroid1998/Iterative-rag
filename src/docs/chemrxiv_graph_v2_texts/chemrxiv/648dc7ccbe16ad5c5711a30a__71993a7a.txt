Description:
A mineral whose pit dissolution at the (001) surface shows no preference among 110, 010, and 100 step edges.

Text:
Both the mechanism (order
31
of bond breakage, changes to coordination environment, etc) and the barriers can be highly sensitive to cleavage
32
planes, surface termination, defects, and pitting (e.g. the type of exposed step edges) (Trindade Pedrosa et al., 2019,
33
Brandt et al., 2003, Bickmore et al., 2001, Kuwahara, 2011). Consider that prior scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
34
studies have reported dissolution rates for galena (PbS) that are much faster along the 110 direction instead of the
35
100 direction on the (001) surface under acidic conditions (Higgins and Hamers, 1996). In contrast, atomic force
36
microscopy (AFM) studies of pit dissolution at the (001) surface of gibbsite does not indicate any preference amongst
37
110, 010 and 100 step edges(Peskleway et al., 2003).

Description:
Its solubility in aqueous solutions highly depends on the pH condition.

Text:
Yet the solution pH alters the surface termination of
38
cleavage planes and influence barriers for bond breaking, e.g., gibbsite solubility in aqueous solutions highly depends
39
on the pH condition (May et al., 1979). 40
Surface imaging probes do not often have atomiclevel resolution and as such key details of the molecular
41
mechanism are lacking. Subtle variations as a function of surface morphology, protonation state, or other aspects
42
of surface termination are not readily apparent. There is thus a significant need for molecularlevel details provided
43
by molecular simulations. These techniques are not without their challenges.
