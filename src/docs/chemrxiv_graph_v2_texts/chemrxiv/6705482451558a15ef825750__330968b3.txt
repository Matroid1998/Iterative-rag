1A).810 Later, a heteroleptic tantalum anilido complex, 
TaCl3(NMePh)22, was shown to exhibit superior catalytic activity 
for the hydroaminoalkylation of 1alkenes with dialkylamines and 
Nmethylaniline derivatives under much milder conditions.11 The 
introduction of N,Ochelating ligands such as Narylamidato 
ligands onto Ta as well as Ti improved the catalytic activity and 
expanded the substrate scope to internal alkenes and styrene 
derivatives as well as cyclic alkylamines.12 Notably, a titanocene 
complex, Ind2TiMe2 (Ind  5indenyl), was also shown to work as 
a catalyst, leading to a wider scope of alkene substrates, including 
styrene derivatives and 1,3dienes.10b,10d Although these d0 metal 
catalysts proved efficient for hydroaminoalkylation, it remains 
challenging to improve the catalytic performance through 
molecular design, in particular with respect to the branchlinear 
selectivity while Tibased catalysts exhibit a large substrate 
scope for alkenes, it is still difficult to control stereoselectivity with 
styrene derivatives and 1,3dienes with arene rings.10
