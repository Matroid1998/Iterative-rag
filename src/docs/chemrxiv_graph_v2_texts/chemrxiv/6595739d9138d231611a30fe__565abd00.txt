Description:
Compounds containing carbon-fluorine bonds, often found in PFAS.

The incineration of AFFF is facing 
37 
regulatory challenges due to concerns about the emission of incomplete combustion products and 
38 
greenhouse gas.6,7 Alternative nonthermal technologies enabling nearcomplete defluorination 
39 
(i.e., conversion of organofluorine on PFAS to fluoride (F)), in addition to degradation of parent 
40 
PFAS compounds, are desired to meet the zero PFAS pollution goal.8 However, deep 
41 
defluorination of even a single type of PFAS is challenging. For instance, the maximum 
42 
defluorination efficiencies of treating perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) by electrochemical 
43 
oxidation, UVsulfite photoreduction, and alkalineassisted heat treatment are below 80.911 The 
44 
deep defluorination of AFFF, a mixture of concentrated PFAS with coexisting solvents and 
45 
surfactants, 12,13 is a nextlevel challenge that has been inadequately addressed.
