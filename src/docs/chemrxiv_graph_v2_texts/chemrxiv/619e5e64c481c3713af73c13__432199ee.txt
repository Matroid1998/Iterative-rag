Description:
Reactive intermediates that can be manipulated along divergent pathways.

Text:
We are interested in applying the ability to shuttle 
aziridinium ylides along divergent pathways to explore diverse new amine chemical space, 
particularly in the context of using our new methods for the preparation of DNAencoded libraries 
(DEL) to explore their potential bioactivity.11ac 

Manipulating the reactivity of aziridinium ylides to achieve a desired reaction outcome can 
be challenging as compared to their acyclic ammonium counterparts.

Description:
Embedded in a highly strained ring, affecting the energy required for pyramidal inversion of nitrogen.

Text:
Aziridinium ylides are 
embedded in a highly strained ring, where the bonding constraints of the aziridine increase the 
energy required for pyramidal inversion of the nitrogen; often this rate is slow enough to measure 
using variable temperature (VT) or dynamic NMR spectroscopy.12ac The presence of two 
invertomers hinders the ability to selectively form and engage aziridinium ylides in secondary 
reactions and has limited their applications in the synthesis of complex Nheterocycles. For
