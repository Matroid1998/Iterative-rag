Description:
Side chains in terpenes that promote favorable cold-weather properties such as low melting points.

Text:
The branched structure of 
isoprene causes most terpenes to have methyl side 
chains, which promotes favorable coldweather 
properties such as low melting points 6. The bio
synthesis process readily produces rings, including 
strained rings with carbon numbers as low as three, 
which gives terpenes high energy densities 6, 7. The biosynthesis process can also functionalize the 
terpenes by adding hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, 
ether bridges, etc. (These molecules are often 
termed terpenoids, but we will include them with 
terpenes.) For some applications, especially current 
aviation engines, oxygen and double bonds are not 
acceptable since they compromise energy density 
and storage stability; therefore terpenes must be 
hydrogenated to saturated hydrocarbons before they 
can be used as fuels 6.
