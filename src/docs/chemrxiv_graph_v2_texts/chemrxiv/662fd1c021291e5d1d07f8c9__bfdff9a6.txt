Description:
An iron (oxyhydr)oxide that controls aqueous concentrations of oxyanion-forming elements.

The mobility and bioavailability of nutrient and contaminant elements in soils, sediments and
30
water are strongly inuenced by atomicscale processes at mineralwater interfaces. Surface
31
adsorption or precipitation reactions can promote element attenuation, while desorption and
32
dissolution reactions may drive element release13. Ferrihydrite (Fh) and other iron (oxy
33
hydr)oxides are often important controls on aqueous concentrations of oxyanionforming ele
34
ments, which can have important implications for ecosystem health and functioning46. For
35
example, molybdate (MoO4
2) adsorption onto Fh surfaces has implications for biosynthesis
36
of Moenzymes central to global biogeochemical cycles that have shaped Earths biological
37
and environmental coevolution.
