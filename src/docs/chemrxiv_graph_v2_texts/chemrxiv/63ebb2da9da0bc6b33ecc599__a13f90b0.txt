Description:
Used in direct borohydride fuel cells as a solution on the cathode.

The electrochemical catalysts have attracted enormous attention with the increasing demand for 
renewable energy storage and conversion.1,2 The hydrogen produced by water splitting from a 
renewable energy source is regarded as one of the clean energy technologies without CO2 emission. The green hydrogen from the renewable electrolysis of water could be utilized in the fuel cell for 
supplying electricity and heat. Liquid fuelbased fuel cells have been looked into for use in portable 
devices due to the simple recharging of fuel.3 The direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs) are 
operated by sodium borohydride solution and hydrogen peroxide solution on the anode and cathode, 
respectively.

The modeling of mixed potential in hydrogen peroxide solution was demonstrated by Zhao et al.6 
The open circuit potential of DBFC contributed by the cathode needs to be considered with the 
mixed potential of PRR, POR, and ORR (equations 4, 5, and 6).7 The reduction reactions (PRR and 
ORR) and oxidation reaction (POR) can be spontaneously established at the cathode of DBFCs. As
