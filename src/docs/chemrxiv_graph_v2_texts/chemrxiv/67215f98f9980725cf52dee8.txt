A family of natural and artificial porous aluminosilicates used in catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange.

Text:
Zeolites are a family of natural and artificial porous aluminosilicates that rank among the most 
widelyproduced crystalline nanoporous materials in the chemical industry, where they are used in 
particular for their active role in catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Computational modelling 
plays a key role in understanding their fundamental properties, linking their physical and chemical 
behaviour at the macroscopic scale to their structure and dynamics at the atomic scale. With this goal, 
different levels of chemical description have been used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 
zeolites, ranging from classical interatomic potentials  with low accuracy but high transferability  
to firstprinciples or ab initio schemes based on Density Functional Theory (DFT)  which feature 
high accuracy along with high computational expense.

Description:
Materials whose properties arise from the interplay between the motions of the framework and external constraints such as temperature changes, mechanical stress, or adsorption of guest molecules.

Text:
Yet, at the 
same time, it is known that a detailed description of the framework dynamics is key in the 
understanding of the macroscopic behaviour of zeolites many of their properties arise from the 
interplay between the motions of the framework with an external constraint, which can be a change 
in temperature, the application of a mechanical stress, or the adsorption of guest molecules (in the gas 
or liquid phase). Computational studies have shown that systematic DFT calculations in the linear 
response regime under the application of pressure,2 or in the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA),3 
allow the calculation of mechanical and thermal properties of puresilica zeolites. However, these
