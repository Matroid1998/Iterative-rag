Description:
A structural component of molnupiravir, which is a nucleoside analogue.

Text:
Molnupiravir 1 is a nucleoside analogue currently in the advanced stages of clinical trials for the 
treatment of Covid191. Positive clinical data prompted early termination of recent phase 3 trials in 
order to seek emergency use authorization to treat adult patients with mildtomoderate Covid19 
who are at risk of progressing to severity or hospitalization. The structural simplicity of Molnupiravir 
compared to alternative therapies (e.g. Remdesivir), combined with its oral availability and broad
spectrum antiviral activities, make it an attractive candidate for the global treatment of viral 
infections. In view of the urgent need to develop therapies for treating the Covid19 pandemic there 
has been considerable interest in developing synthetic routes to this API. The original synthesis 
required 10 steps and proceeded with 10 overall yield2,3.
