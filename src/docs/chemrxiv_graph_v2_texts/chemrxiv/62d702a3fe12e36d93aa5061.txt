Description:
A greenhouse gas emitted from the incineration of end-of-life plastics.

More 
greenhouse gases (GHGs) are released in upstream and downstream of production, including 
fugitive methane from upstream extraction processes(69), CO2 from endoflife plastics 
incineration (10), nitrous oxide (N2O) from fertilizer application (11), and indirect GHGs from 
the generation of electricity and heat (12). Predominantly linear value chains, agricultural inputs 
and expanding landuse generate further environmental impact. For example, approximately 57 
of the nitrogen in fertilizers is not absorbed by plants but instead finds its way into waterways 
and oceans (1315), where it is joined by an estimated 11 Mt yr1 of plastics leaked from 
ineffective waste management systems (1518).
