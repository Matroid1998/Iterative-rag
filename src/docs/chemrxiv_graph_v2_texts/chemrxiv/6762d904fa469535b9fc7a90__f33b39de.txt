Hence, the solar energy 
conversion efficiency of OPV devices has increased sixfold, reaching 20 over the past two 
decades17. Their early onset potentials and high photocurrents18,19, especially in neutral pH 
solutions20, have attracted substantial interest towards solar fuel production, with stateoftheart 
synthetic catalyst systems sustaining H2 and syngas production for days. However, effectively 
interfacing OSCs with enzymes remains challenging18. Early works21,22 on the electrochemical wiring 
of enzymes to electrodes have focused on (photoinactive) redox polymer mediators comprising of 
viologen or osmiumbased moieties tethered to a nonconjugated backbone2325. Despite being 
nondiffusional, they remain limited by slow electron hopping23 and the polymeric mediator that 
controls the driving force (potential) available for the enzyme26.
