of the commonly used molecular dopants such as for example
F4TNCQ (tetracyano2,3,5,6tetrauoroquinodimethane). Lewis
acid doping was proposed as an alternative that partially over
comes these limitations in P3HT (poly(3hexylthiophene)).10 As
recently reported by Yurash et al.,11 the doping of the polymer
PCPDTBT (poly2,6(4,4bis(2ethylhexyl)4Hcyclopenta 2,1
b;3,4bdithio phene)alt4,7(2,1,3benzothiadiazole)) with the
strong Lewis acid BCF (tris(pentauorophenyl)borane) exceeds
the doping achieved using traditional molecular ptype doping
with F4TNCQ. As for the origin of doping via BCF a multistep
mechanism was proposed. First, a Brnstedtype acid BCFH2O
complex is formed in solution which is then capable of protonat
ing the polymers backbone and leaves behind a BCFOH counter
anion.
