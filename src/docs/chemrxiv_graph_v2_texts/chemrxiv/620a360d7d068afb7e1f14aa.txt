Description:
Used as a surface for DNA immobilization in detection applications.

For instance, they have recently been applied for the detection 
of a variety of heavy metals species in water where one comb was 
used as a working electrode and the other as a generator electrode, 
allowing electrochemical modification of local pH for improving 
sensing efficacy 15, 16. They have also been applied to DNA de
tection where the probe DNA was either immobilised on both IDEs 
17 or the silicon surface between them 1820. Typically, the 
DNA hybridisation was detected using conductance measured be
tween the two IDEs or impedance, when IDEs were used. Selective 
modification of only one IDE could enable using the other IDE for 
other function that sensing as well as using other techniques for 
DNA detection, such as linear sweep voltammetry.
