Description:
A system less explored in expanding the MRTADF skeleton.

Text:
It is possible to replace these with 
carbonyl groups, and the groups of ZysmanColman12 Zhang,13 and Jiang and Liao14 
were amongst the first to report examples of MRTADF emitters containing this motif. Expanding the MRTADF skeleton has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy 
to improve the performance of MRTADF emitters,15 one that has been less explored in 
carbonylamine systems. httpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv20233rwq9 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000171836022 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv. License CC BY 4.0
