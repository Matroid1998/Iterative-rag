Description:
Compounds for which various syntheses of multiply arylated derivatives have been reported.

Text:
Walsh and 
coworkers demonstrated a straightforward synthesis of tetraarylme
thanes from diarylmethanes.15 After deprotonation of the diarylme
thane with a base (KOtBu), two further arenes can be introduced 
by palladiumcatalyzed CH arylations with aryl chlorides. A varie
ty of tetraarylmethanes can be synthesized, although an electron
deficient heteroarene (a pyridine moiety) is required for one of the 
aromatic rings of the diarylmethane. While various syntheses of 
multiply arylated alkanes have been reported, thus far, there is no 
unified synthetic protocol from the same starting materials.
