Description:
A compound that can be converted into renewable fuels or value-added chemical feedstocks through electrochemical reduction.

Text:
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) offers
the promise of converting CO2 into renewable
fuels or valueadded chemical feed stocks.13
However, controlling the efficiency and selec
tivity of CO2R remains a significant challenge. While much effort has been devoted to cata
lyst design, it is also widely reported that the
electrolyte composition has a significant effect
on reaction kinetics.410 In electrocatalytic pro
cesses, the electrode and the electrolyte repre
sent the two sides of the solidliquid interface,
which forms the local environment for the elec
tron and proton transfer reactions that drive
catalysis.
