Hydrogen generation via photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting represents one 
of the promising strategies to secure the future supply of free (lowentropy) energy in 
an environmentally sustainable manner.14 Compared to the hydrogen evolution 
reaction (HER), which is a protoncoupled twoelectron process, the oxygen evolution 
reaction (OER) is a typical kinetic bottleneck of PEC devices since the mechanism of 
oxygen generation is much more complex, involving concerted transfer of four 
electrons and four protons.5,6 Accordingly, the development of efficient, stable and low
cost photoanodes for water oxidation is of paramount importance for the realization of 
economically viable PEC water splitting devices.7 Some of the most intensely 
investigated photoanodes are based on passivated highquality semiconductors (e.g., 
Si or IIIV compounds),810 hybrid inorganicorganic architectures,1114 or on lowcost 
metal oxides, such as Fe2O3,15,16 CuWO417,18 or BiVO4.3,1925 In particular, BiVO4 is an 
attractive material owing to its bandgap energy of 2.42.6 eV, which translates to the 
maximum theoretically achievable photocurrents of 6.48.9 mA cm2 and the solarto
hydrogen (STH) efficiencies of 811 under AM 1.5G (1 sun) illumination.
