A greenhouse gas whose emissions contribute to climate change.

Text:
During the world climate conference in 2021, 153 countries agreed on a Glasgow Climate Pact keeping the 1.5C 
target of global warming temperature within reach, with plans to revisit and tighten their emissions targets by 
2030.1 The persistent rise in humandriven CO2 emissions continues to intensify climate change, underscoring 
the critical need for effective carbon capture strategies.2 As temperatures rise and environmental challenges 
unfold, the demand for innovative approaches to reduce carbon emissions grows steadily.
