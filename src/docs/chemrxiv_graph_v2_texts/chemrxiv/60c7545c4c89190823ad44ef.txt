Description:
A gas considered for storage in advanced nanoporous materials for vehicular applications.

Text:
Newer
classes of nanoporous materials, such as metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) 11, porous organic
cages (POCs) 12, and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) 13, exhibit very high internal surface
areas 14, 15 and have demonstrated promise for gas densication in the context of vehicular hy
drogen and methane storage 16, motivating us to consider these advanced nanoporous materials
for adsorbed xenon propellant storage. Moreover, several of these nanoporous materials exhibit a
high anity for xenon, evidenced by their adsorptive selectivity for xenon in the context of separa
tions 1720. Here, we develop a simple mathematical model of an adsorbed xenon propellant storage system
that enables us to evaluate and rank adsorbents for adsorbed xenon propellant storage.
