Description:
Reacts with glycine under base conditions.

Text:
Synthesis Part The dinitrofluorobenzene were treated with glycine under base condition to 
get product13 4, which is treated with oxalyl chloride to get acid chloride product14 5. The free 
glycine ester15 6 is prepared with base treatment in 90 yield. On combining the 5 with 6 to 
gives the dipeptide16 ester 7 in 60  yield. The diester 7 on saponification gives dipeptide17 
2a in 75 yield. (scheme1)

Alternatively, dipeptide acid 2a was prepared from phthalimido ethanol18 8, which on 
oxidation to acid product19 9 followed by acid chloride20 conversion gives 10 in 91 yield, 
which was esterified to MPM ester21 11 by using MPMOH, the phthalide group is cleaved by 
40 monomethyl amine to get glycine MPM ester22 12 in 55 yield. (scheme2)
