In this paper, we propose a new computational approach to characterize MBMC designed to 
capture the conditions experienced in condensed matter via the application fourbody external 
potentials that affects torsional (proper dihedrals) and outofplane deformations (improper 
dihedrals). Our approach demonstrates the importance of manybody deformations on the 
activation energy of mechanophore isomerization (spiropyran) and the thermal decomposition of 
1,3,5trinitro2,4,6triaminobenzene (TATB). In the first example, we couple a fourbody 
deformation around the spiro atom and apply the widely used CoGEF31 method to load the 
mechanophore. We show that straining the central torsional angle by 50 reduces the energy 
barrier associated with the mechanical activation of the mechanophore by a factor of two.
