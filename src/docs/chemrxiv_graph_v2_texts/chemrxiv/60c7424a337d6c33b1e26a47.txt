Description:
Regulated by vitamin D for absorption and serum homeostasis.

Text:
Vitamin D, a class of secosteroids, is responsible for regulating calcium 
absorption, bone development, and serum calcium homeostasis1. Evidence is growing 
which links vitamin D deficiency to a myriad of diseases, including osteomalacia, 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer2,3, while during pregnancy, vitamin D 
deficiency has been linked to low birth weight and preterm birth46. Vitamin D is 
obtained either by consumption from dietary sources or by supplementation (vitamin D2 
from plant and D3 from animal sources) or biosynthesized from 7hydrocholesterol upon 
exposure to UV radiation (vitamin D3). In the liver, vitamin D is converted to 25
hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the main circulating metabolite, and further metabolism in 
the kidneys produces 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D, which is responsible for the genomic 
and rapid response functions7.
