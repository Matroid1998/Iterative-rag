Description:
The next member in the homologous series CnH2n1CONH2, recently detected in space.

The interstellar presence of molecules with a peptide moiety, C(O)NH, is suggestive
of an extraterrestrial origin for life on Earth.1 Acetamide, H3CC(O)NH2, is not only one
of the most abundant organic molecules present in the neighbourhood of Sagittarius B22,3
but has also been found in comets.4 It has been postulated to be the key precursor to more
complex organic species although there are currently no obvious routes that would explain its
formation in the gasphase.5,6 The very recent detection of propionamide, C2H5CONH2, the
next member in the homologous series, CnH2n1CONH2, suggests that peptidelike molecules
might be widespread in space;7 however, Kolesnikova et al.

Description:
Not detected towards Sgr B2(N).

have not conrmed this claim
and could detect neither propionamide nor the unsaturated prop2enamide or acrylamide,
H2CCHCONH2, towards Sgr B2(N).8 Since nitriles are abundant in the ISM, Alonso et
al. have speculated, that the hydrolysis of cyanoacetylene HCCCN, would lead to the
formation of 2propynamide, HCCCONH2; however, the search was unsuccesful.9
Apart from Nmethyl formamide10 no other species with molecular formula C2H5NO has
been found and it is therefore of interest to document those isomers and provide some key
background detail of these neutral species which contain in C, H, N and O  the four basic
exobiological elements.
