Description:
Involved in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Text:
Selectively changing the
shell thickness, the particle size, or the compo
sition of the core (alloying) or the shell results
in changes in the electronic properties of the
surface atoms, which in turn has a significant
impact on their catalytic activity.18 Prominent
examples are Ptmodified Rucore nanoparticle
catalysts, which were intensively studied over
the last decade for the oxygen reduction re
action (ORR),913 the hydrogen oxidation re
action (HOR) including also the CO tolerance
in that reaction,10,1418 the hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER),17,18 the formic acid oxidation
reaction (FAOR),19 the ethanol oxidation re
action (EOR),2023 the carbon monoxide oxi
dation reaction (COOR),11,19 or the methanol
oxidation reaction (MOR).21,2429
An important aspect for possible applications
of such electrodes is their stability during oper
ation.
