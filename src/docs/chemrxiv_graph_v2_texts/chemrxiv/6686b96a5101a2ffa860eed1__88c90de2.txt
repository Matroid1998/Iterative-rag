Description:
Conjugated compounds with delocalized electrons exhibiting aromatic-antiaromatic behavior and a biradical-quinoidal ground state electronic structure.

Conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (CPHs) have gained considerable interest due to their 
versatile applications in optoelectronic devices,14 organic spintronics58 and semiconductors9, as 
well as energy storage devices.10,11 The unique photophysical properties of CPHs make them a 
promising solution not only in functional materials but also found to be fundamentally important 
for providing insights into chemical properties such as the openshell radical character and 
aromaticity.1215 Among such CPHs conjugated indenofluorenes (IFs) possess one of the most 
interesting topologies of delocalized electrons with different types of behavior 
(aromaticantiaromatic) and ground state electronic structure (biradicalquinoidal).16,17 They 
exhibit a 65656 ring architecture, which is obtained by a fusion of the indene unit to various 
positions of the fluorene unit.
