Amines with various functional groups such as unsaturated bonds CC, CO, CC, and CN, 
are classified as privileged compounds and are widely used in fine chemicals, herbicides, 
pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, agrochemicals, dyes, and polymers 16. Specifically, there are more 
than 110 amine derivatives drugs containing nitrogen andor amino groups in the reported top 200 
pharmaceuticals by Retail Sales in 20207. With the serious problems raised from the environmental 
and economic, especially the recent widespread COVID19 problems, the development of fast, 
efficient, and environmentally friendlier synthesis processes for amines derivatives are urgent 810. So far, many synthetic methodologies have been developed and applied in academics and 
industry3,4,1115. One of the important and popular chemical transformations is using supported
