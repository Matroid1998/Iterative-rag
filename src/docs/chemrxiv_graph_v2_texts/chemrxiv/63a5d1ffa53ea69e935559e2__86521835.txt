Description:
Materials with excellent optoelectronic performance due to the ns2 electronic configuration of the lead cation and halide anion, known for high defect tolerance.

Leadhalide perovskites have been at the forefront of photovoltaic (PV) research in the last
decade due to their rapidly increasing efficiencies.1,2 Much of their excellent optoelectronic
performance has been associated with the ns2 electronic configuration of the lead cation in
combination with the halide anion leading to materials that are highly defect tolerant.3 This
characteristic feature can guide the search for perovskiteinspired materials which repro
duce the optoelectronic performance while avoiding the use of toxic elements.35 On the other
hand, metal chalcogenides have not managed to achieve the same efficiencies as halide per
ovskites, predominantly due to intrinsic defects limiting their performance.69 However, they
have shown improved water and air stability, compared to their halide conterparts, which
is essential in the development of PV modules that can compete with the device lifespans
of siliconbased technologies.10 As a result, metal chalcohalides offer a promising alternative
to both classes of materials, combining the ambient stability of metal chalcogenides with
the desirable cationanion bonding of halide perovskites.
