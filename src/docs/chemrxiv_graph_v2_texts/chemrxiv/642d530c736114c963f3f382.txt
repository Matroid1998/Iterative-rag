Description:
A greenhouse gas that needs to be reduced and removed from the atmosphere to limit global warming.

Text:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that, in addition to rapidly re
ducing CO2 emissions, we will need to remove between 1.329 GtCO2 from the atmosphere
annually by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5C above preindustrial temperatures.1 Car
bon dioxide removal (CDR) encompasses a set of solutions that accomplishes this task by
drawing down atmospheric CO2 and durably storing it. Many CDR solutions, however, are
not yet ready for largescale deployment as there is significant uncertainty regarding their
mechanics, cost, and broader impact. Further, deployment of these solutions may require
long lead times that will need to be compressed in order to mitigate climate change on rel
evant time scales.
