Description:
A greenhouse gas that is sequestered in significant quantities to limit global temperature rise.

Within the global emissions scenarios 
44 
considered within the sixth assessment report, those that have a greater than 67 chance of limiting global temperature 
45 
rise to less than 2oC include between 196  280 Gt of sequestered CO2 from fossil CO2 alone by 2100 2, not including 
46 
atmospheric CO2 removal via bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) or direct air CO2 capture and storage (DACCS). The International 
47 
Energy Agencys (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario, in which global emissions from the energy sector reach net zero 
48 
by 2070, includes 240 Gt CO2 sequestered by 2070, accounting for 15 of emission reductions 3.
