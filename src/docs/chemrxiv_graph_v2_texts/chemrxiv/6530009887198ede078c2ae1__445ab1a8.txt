Description:
Used as the leaching acid in hydrometallurgical processes.

Cell 
casing, separator and current collector are subsequently removed, creating a fraction commonly referred to as black mass, the 
smallest fraction after sieving, which contains a mixture of anode and cathode materials.11 The black mass is then chemically 
treated; by far the most common combination of reagents in the literature is sulfuric acid as the leaching acid and H2O2 as the 
reducing agent, which has been shown to improve leaching efficiency.1217 Although most hydrometallurgical routes utilise 
relatively concentrated mineral acids, which could pose a disposal challenge, as well as comparatively long leaching times to 
bring all the metals into solution, this route does in principle allow for the recycling of materials through a closedloop process 
which aims to regenerate either the original material or to make upcycled or next generation materials using cathodeanode 
scrap as starting materials.
