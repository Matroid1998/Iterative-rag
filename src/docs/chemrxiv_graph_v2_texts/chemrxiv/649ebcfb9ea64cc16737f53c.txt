Description:
Cinchona alkaloids have methods for synthesis that are often insufficiently modular.

Text:
However, both the chromophore and overall architecture 
of quinine is relatively inflexible due to its isolation from a natural source, limiting the application of 
such species in the development of SARs. Further, while methods for the synthesis of cinchona 
alkaloids exist,7, 8 they are often insufficiently modular to permit significant structural variation. We 
therefore considered whether structural analogues of quinine might demonstrate similar PL 
properties while being accessible via a more modular synthetic strategy. This would provide easy 
access to families of compounds possessing both variable chromophores and intramolecular 
distances, thus enabling the unpacking of the fundamental processes of throughspace charge transfer
