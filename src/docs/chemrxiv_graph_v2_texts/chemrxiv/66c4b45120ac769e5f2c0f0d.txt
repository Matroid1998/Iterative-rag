Description:
Prominent molecular photoswitches used in various chemical fields.

Text:
Molecular photoswitches change their geometry and electronic properties due to light stimuli 
in a reversible fashion. Over the past decades, a wide range of photoswitches has been 
established.1, 2 The most prominent ones are stilbenes,3, 4 azobenzenes,58 and diarylethenes,912 
which are highly developed and applied in virtually every chemical field. More recent 
representatives 
are 
hydrazones,13 
Stenhouse 
dyes,1416 
imidazolebiradicals,1719 
hemipiperazines,20 periaryloxyquinones,21, 22 or indigoids2329 broadening significantly the 
structural space, properties, and possibilities for applications. Additionally, the strategic 
alteration of more classical photoswitch structures also allows for significant leaps in 
performance and applications, which is well illustrated by the elaboration of azobenzene
