and is amenable to scaleup in both batch and flow settings. Decarboxylative Arylation of Tertiary Acids Development 
Optimization studies commenced with pivalic acidderived RAE 
4 and bromopyridine 5 (Table 1). Using the electrochemical condi
tions previously reported,19 a 19 isolated yield of an inseparable 41 
mixture of isomers was obtained wherein the desired tbutyl pyridine 
6a was the major product. Isomer 6b presumably arises from a Ni
