Description:
Another name for azetines, which are four-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles with one unit of unsaturation.

Text:
Fourmembered nitrogencontaining heterocycles (Fig. 1A) 
have recently gained increased interest and popularity for their 
potential as underexplored biologically active compounds. While azetidines (1) represent fully saturated fourmembered 
Nheterocycles, azetines (2, 3), also known as dihydroazetes, 
are their corresponding counterparts with one unit of 
unsaturation. Specifically, 1azetines (2) contain an imine 
functional group with a double bond between the nitrogen 
atom and the neighbouring carbon atom. In comparison, 2
azetines (3) incorporate a carboncarbon double bond in the 
heterocycle.
