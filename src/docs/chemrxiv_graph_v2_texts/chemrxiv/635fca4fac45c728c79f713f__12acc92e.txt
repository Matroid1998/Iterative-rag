Description:
A solvent used in the conversion of mixtures to ketoenolic products.

Text:
Due to the 
difficulty of separating these two compounds, the mixture was 
oxidized directly with DessMartin periodinane, to afford the 
formation of 1,2dicarbonyl tertiary alcohol 7 and enol (R)7 in the 
same 41 ratio. It was then envisaged that the deoxygenation of 
hydroxy ketone could promote the transformation of 7 to (R)7. Fortunately, treatment with trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI)13 in 
chloroform converted the crude mixture to the expected keto
enolic product (R)7, in 54 yield over 4 steps. Scheme 3. Formation of the ketoenol compound (R)7 from (R)4f.
