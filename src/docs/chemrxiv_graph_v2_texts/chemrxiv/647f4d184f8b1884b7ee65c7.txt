Description:
A surfactant that can lead to interfacial electric fields as large as 1 V/nm.

The ability of surfactant molecules to selfassemble
into monolayers at the airwater interface (AWI) is
wellunderstood in terms of the thermodynamics associ
ated with their amphiphilic character.1,2 An amphiphilic
molecule, which is defined by a hydrophilic head group
covalently bound to a hydrophobic tail group, is par
ticularly suited for selfassembly in aqueous solution due
to the balancing of the hydrophobic effect310 between
tail groups with the high watersolubility of the head
groups.1,2,11
While many general features of this phenomenon are
understood, the enormous variety of possible combi
nations of head and tail groups bound within a sin
gle surfactant, compounded with the even greater va
riety of possible surfactant mixtures, opens questions
about how one might optimize a surfactant system for
a particular application.12 Recently, as part of a team
of researchers looking to use soap bubbles for artifi
cial photosynthesis12, we have shown that surfactant
interfaces including C12E6 can lead to interfacial elec
tric fields as large as 1Vnm.13 These magnitude and
lengthscales of these fields are finely tuned by both the
length of the surfactant and oriented water structure.

brational sum frequency generation spectroscopic mea
surements demonstrated that the presence of a C12E6
monolayer at the AWI enhances the interfacial binding
affinity of SDS compared to that of SDS binding to the
bare AWI.12 Umbrella sampling (US)24,25 molecular dy
namics (MD) simulations corroborated this interpreta
tion, showing a twofold enhancement of the free energy
of DS(the surfactant part of SDS) binding to the air
C12E6water interface (ACWI) compared to the free en
ergy of binding to the AWI.

Description:
Forms a monolayer that exhibits cooperative interfacial adsorption with DS, demonstrating a synergistic effect.

Text:
This result demonstrates
the inadequacy of the Langmuir adsorption model in de
scribing mixed surfactant monolayer selfassembly due
to a combination of adsorbateadsorbate interactions as
well as collective effects between DS, C12E6, and the
interfacial water. Here we employ free energy decompositions (FEDs)
to gain a more detailed understanding of the observed
cooperative interfacial adsorption between DSand the
C12E6 monolayer, which we refer to as the synergistic
effect. As is typical in FEDs with the thermodynamic
integration1416,18 and free energy perturbation6,16,18,19
techniques, we utilize socalled alchemical intermediate
states to extract components of the binding free energy
due to specific interactions. In particular, the difference
between the free energy profile of DSand that of the
corresponding hydrophobic limit, DS0 (i.e.
