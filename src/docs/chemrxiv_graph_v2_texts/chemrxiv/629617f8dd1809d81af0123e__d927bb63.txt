Description:
Formed through the cobalt-catalyzed coupling of enaminones and oxadiazolones.

6,7 Herein we report the development of a homeostatic catalysis approach 
to combat these offloop challenges. Homeostasis is a Natures way of selfregulation that allows 
a biological system to maintain functional activity even in a hostile external environment. 8,9 One 
mechanism to achieve such a highly effective performance is through the localization of a dynamic 
and reversible chemical equilibrium process on a dedicated response unit so that no unintended, 
irreversible damage is inflicted upon the whole system. The homeostatic catalysis concept 
described herein recapitulates these mechanistic features and refers to a catalytic process that can 
sustain its productive catalytic cycle even when chemically disturbed. In particular, cobalt 
homeostatic catalysis permits the watertolerant coupling of enaminones and oxadiazolones to 
quinazolinones.
