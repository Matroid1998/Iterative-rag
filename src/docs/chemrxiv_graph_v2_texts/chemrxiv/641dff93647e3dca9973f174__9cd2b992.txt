Description:
A type of macromonomer used for elastomeric networks preparation.

Text:
In our previous work, we demonstrated that bismuth and zincbased homometallic catalysts can be 
attractive, less toxic alternatives to DBTDL for the synthesis of photocurable esterurethane 
macromonomers for elastomeric networks preparation 17. Here, we aim to investigate heterometallic
