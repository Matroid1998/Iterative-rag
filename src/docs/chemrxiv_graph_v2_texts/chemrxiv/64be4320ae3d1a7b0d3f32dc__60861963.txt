Combined with Zeises salt to obtain a promising compound.

The efficacy of Celecoxib led to its approval by the FDA as adjunctive therapy for the 
treatment of FAP in the USA.11,12 Another example is the COX2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib, which was found 
to increase apoptosis and reduce proliferation in a Lewis lung (3LL) tumor cell line in a dosedependent and 
timedependent way.12 Moreover, several preclinical studies suggest the possibility for COX2 selective 
inhibitors to enhance the effects of chemo and radiotherapy.8 All these studies support the hypothesis that 
COX2 selective inhibitors may be an interesting class of compounds as chemopreventive, cytostatic or 
cytotoxic agents, given the wellknown low sideeffect profile compared to classic and nonselective 
NSAIDs.13 
In our research group, one of the first discovered organometallic compounds, potassium 
trichloro(ethylene)platinate (II) or Zeises salt (ZS), was investigated as a metal core for a possible new drug 
concept.14 A promising compound was obtained by combining ZS with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
