Description:
A unit (C3N3) that forms part of PTI, linked by imide bridges into layered materials.

2Dmaterials, most 
famously graphene, have a different electronic structure than their layered analogues due to 
the confinement of the electron gas to the 2Dcrystal.68 In general, semiconducting 2D 
materials are expected to suffer less from short channel effects making them uniquely suitable 
for highly miniaturized field effect transistors.9 
Graphitic carbon nitrides form a subset of 2D, layered COFs that are semiconductors and can 
be exfoliated.1014 At present, PTI and its intercalated derivatives are the best characterized 
graphitic carbon nitrides.1518 They are composed of triazine (C3N3) units that are covalently
linked inplane by imidebridges into layered materials with high thermal stability up to 
400 C.15 Because of their high nitrogen content, PTI has a high ionization potential  that 
means, a high energetic difference between the vacuum level and the highest valence band
