Semiconductors known for high indoor power conversion efficiency due to exceptional defect tolerance.

The boom of the InternetofThings (IoT) urges to address the compelling need of powering an 
evergrowing number of ubiquitous sensors in a costeffective, sustainable, and energy
efficient way. Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are acknowledged as a key technology to fulfill 
these requirements, in turn enabling the promised further development of IoT.1 However, no 
IPVs have been yet identified that combine high indoor power conversion efficiency (PCE(i)) 
and reasonable air stability while comprising lowtoxicity and abundant constituents. Among 
the most promising IPV contenders, halide perovskite semiconductors have so far led to the 
highest PCE(i) thanks to their exceptional defect tolerance, particularly towards intrinsic point 
defects.2 Nevertheless, the water solubility and bioaccumulation of lead (Pb)2 cation of halide 
perovskite compositions pose serious toxicity and recycling concerns.
