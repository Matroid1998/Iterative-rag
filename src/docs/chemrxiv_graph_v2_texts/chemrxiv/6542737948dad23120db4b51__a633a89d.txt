Description:
A bulk material used as a source for producing graphene through exfoliation.

Text:
The groundbreaking discovery of graphene by topdown exfoliation of bulk graphite using 
Scotch tape led to the foundation of 2D material research.1 Since then, this technique has been 
one of the most successful and widely utilized techniques to produce monolayer materials.24 
However, the materials produced by this technique are unpractically small in size and often 
appear together with a very high ratio of bulk layers. Moreover, the involved viscoelastic stamps 
in this process release chemical fingerprints on the materials, altering the intrinsic nature of the 
produced atomthin layers.2,5 The exfoliation of 2D materials under ambient conditions has
