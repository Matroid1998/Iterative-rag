Description:
Studied in systems such as carbon nanotubes and graphene for their role in Frenkel excitons.

Text:
Understanding Frenkel excitons is
pivotal for the design and optimization of organic semiconductors. Additionally, beyond
their significance in molecular crystals and organic semiconductors, Frenkel excitons have
been subjects of study in other systems, including carbon nanotubes11 and graphene12 . Overall, they represent a crucial type of excited state in molecular systems, offering a broad
spectrum of potential applications in areas such as optoelectronics and energy conversion13 . However, a significant challenge persists in understanding the correlations between molecular
properties, packing, and exciton transport within organic semiconductors. Furthermore, the
extensive diversity of available organic compounds makes the pursuit of suitable candidates
both timeconsuming and financially demanding.
