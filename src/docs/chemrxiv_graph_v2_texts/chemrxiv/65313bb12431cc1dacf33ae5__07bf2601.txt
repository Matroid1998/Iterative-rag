Description:
Forms helical hydrogen-bonded stacks used in enantioselective catalysis.

Text:
Second, 
homochiral helical catalysts are accessible thanks to the ability of 
a little amount of chiral monomers or of a scalemic mixture of 
monomer enantiomers to impose their chiral preference to a large 
number of achiral metalcontaining monomers, thanks to well
established sergeantsandsoldiers and diluted majority rule 
principles.45,46 
We 
previously 
demonstrated 
that 
helical 
hydrogenbonded stacks composed of a benzene1,3,5 
tricarboxamide47,48 (BTA) achiral phosphine ligand and a small 
amount 
of 
enantiopure 
monomers 
provide 
good 
enantioselectivities in the coppercatalyzed hydrosilylation of 4
nitroacetophenone41 and in the coppercatalyzed
