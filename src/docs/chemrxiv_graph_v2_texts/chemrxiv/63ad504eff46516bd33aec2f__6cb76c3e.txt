Recently, 
several 
C(sp3)rich 
bicyclic 
hydrocarbons, due to their rigid conformation and metabolic stability, have shown great 
potential in replacing the benzene rings.4 Among them, bicyclo2.1.1hexanes (BCHs) are 
of particular interest (Scheme 1a).5 Depending on the substitution pattern, they can mimic 
both ortho and metasubstituted benzenoids, and have therefor received increasing 
attention in drug design. Nevertheless, their flexible synthesis, especially the catalytic 
version, still poses a formidable challenge. Previously, the intramolecular 2  2 cycloaddition of 1,5dienes under UV light 
irradiation provides an efficient route for BCHs synthesis.6 Alternatively, the strain
releasedriven 2  2 cycloaddition of bicyclo1.1.0butanes (BCBs)7 with alkenes 
represents another useful strategy. In this regard, the thermodriven reactions at high 
temperature (up to 150 
oC) were known.8 Wipf later demonstrated that the
