Description:
Harmful compounds produced during ozone production in air.

Text:
Traditionally, ozone is 
produced in air (or oxygen) via corona discharge, under very high voltages.6 This process is 
energy intensive, requires a high initial cost, and produces large amounts of heat and also 
harmful nitrogen oxides (in air).79 In contrast, electrochemical ozone production (EOP) has 
gained much attention as dissolved ozone can be produced simply by oxidizing water at a 
suitable anode, with the advantages of a smallscale and robust experimental setup, low 
voltage operation, high current efficiency and no gas feedstocks.10 
Efficient EOP requires an anode that electrocatalytically favors EOP over the oxygen 
evolution reaction (OER).
