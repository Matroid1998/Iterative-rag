Description:
Participate in visible light-mediated tandem addition-elimination reactions with alkenes.

Text:
Trifluoromethyl styrenes are reported in several recent publications visible lightmediated 
tandem additionelimination reaction of iododifluoromethyl ketones and alkenes 7, 
palladiumcatalyzed radical tandem dearomatization of indoles with unactivated alkenes 8, 
photoinitiated multicomponent antiMarkovnikov alkoxylation over graphene oxide 9, 
electrochemical ringopening dicarboxylation of strained carboncarbon single bonds with 
CO2 leading to synthesis of diacids and derivatization into polyesters 10. Cucatalyzed 
alkylationcyanation type difunctionalization of styrenes with aliphatic aldehydes and 
TMSCN via decarbonylation 11. Trifluoromethoxy ringsubstituted styrenes also reported 
in tuning the latent behavior of molybdenum imido alkylidene Nheterocyclic carbene
