Description:
Tetrahedra that interlink different Ca chains.

Text:
The two different Ca chains are interlinked by PO4 tetrahedra (Figure 
1).12 Electron and laser probe microanalysis of magmatichydrothermal apatite showed that REY are 
incorporated in the crystal structure and substituted for Ca.7 Three questions arise from this result (1) 
in which Ca site are REY preferentially incorporated in the structure, (2) does the partitioning of REY
