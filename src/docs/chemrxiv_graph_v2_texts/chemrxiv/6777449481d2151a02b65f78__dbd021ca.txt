Industrial initiatives provide significant benefits to humanity. Numerous sectors engage in the 
production of a significant quantity of commodities that are integral to our everyday existence. These goods are comprised of a diverse range of constituents. Numerous sectors, including the 
fertilizer, textile, and food industries, employ a significant quantity of dyes. The utilization of 
crystal violet dye is predominantly observed within the textile industry owing to its economical 
nature and notable water solubility. One of the issues associated with the utilization of this 
particular dye is the absence of an established safe dosage as determined by the Food and Drug

environmental contamination.
