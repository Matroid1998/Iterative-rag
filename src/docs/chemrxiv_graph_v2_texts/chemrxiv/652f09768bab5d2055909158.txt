Description:
Involved in hydrogen bonding, contributing to the structural versatility of tetrahedral networks in water.

Water is a ubiquitous substance on Earth and plays a crucial role in various elds, in
cluding energy harvesting,1 biological processes,2 and the evolution of life.35 Despite its
simple chemical formula, water is a complex system with multiple anomalies and a rich
phase diagram, attributed to the nature of hydrogen bonding and the structural versatility
of tetrahedral networks.3,68 The intricate thermodynamics of water has been the focus of
numerous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aimed at providing molecularlevel insights
into waters anomalies, the melting and freezing mechanisms of ice, and the features of ice
and water surfaces. These phenomena typically involve extended time and size scales, which
are inaccessible to rstprinciples molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations.
