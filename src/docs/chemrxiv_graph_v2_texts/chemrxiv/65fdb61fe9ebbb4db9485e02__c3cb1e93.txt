Description:
A nitrogen-containing derivative cation studied by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy.

Text:
Recently, the EPD
optical spectrum and fragmentation pathways of the cyanoadamantane cation (Ada
CN) were reported by Crandall et al. 16. Another nitrogencontaining derivate
cation which has gained interest is the amantadine cation (Ama or AdaNH
2 ),
which has been studied by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy by the
group of Dopfer 20,24. It was found that substitution of a hydrogen atom (of the
adamantane cage) with the NH2 group greatly facilitates opening of the adamantane
cage 20,24. The optical spectrum of Ama has not been reported so far though. We
also note that an IRPD spectrum for AdaCN was presented by the same group 25.
