Description:
A substituted cyclohexene system is typically formed in Diels-Alder reactions.

Text:
. The DielsAlder (DA) reaction, first elucidated
in the previous century, stands as a cornerstone
of organic synthesis. This cycloaddition reaction
involves the formation of a conjugated diene and
a dienophile, typically an alkene, culminating in
a substituted cyclohexene system. DA reactions
are one of most useful techniques for creating
carboncarbon bonds.1,2 Furthermore, such reac
tions were fundamental in the creation of famous
the WoodwardHoffmann rules,3 a set of principles
governing the stereochemistry of organic reactions. Of particular note for common DA reactions are
their capacity to result in either an endo or exo
isomer during the formation of the transition state. This results in two distinct products. More specifi
cally, if we consider the reaction between cyclopen
tadiene and acrylonitrile (see Fig.
