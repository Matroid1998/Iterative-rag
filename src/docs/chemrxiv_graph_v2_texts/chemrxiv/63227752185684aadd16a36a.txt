Description:
A promising candidate as a turbine material due to its high melting point, low density, high room temperature ductility, and low ductile to brittle temperature.

Among these, niobium is a promising candidate as a turbine material due to its 
high melting point, low density, high room temperature ductility, and low ductile to brittle 
temperature 2. Hightemperature, highstrength Nbbased alloys can be realized by adding 
suitable alloying elements which can provide a solid solution, dispersion, and multiphase 
strengthening, as well known in the physical metallurgy of refractory alloys 3,4. However, 
these alloying elements yield a huge compositional design space. Suppose we have fourteen 
alloying elements, excluding the base element niobium, and each alloying elements 
composition varies from 1 weight percent to 20 weight percent with a step size of 1 weight 
percent. In that case, the total number of possible alloy combinations can be expressed as
