Description:
A material with small atomic and ionic radii, low density, high tensile strength, high melting point, and oxidative resistance.

Despite aforementioned 
challenges, beryllium has been ubiquitous in industries such as nuclear, aerospace, medical and manufacturing due to small 
atomic (112 pm) and ionic radii (45 pm) inducing strong covalent bond resultant material properties of low density (1.85 
gcm3), tensile strength exceeding 700 MPa, high melting point (1560 K), modulus of elasticity (303 GPa), neutron 
reflectivity and oxidative resistance. Motivated by the potential of ternary beryllium oxides for optoelectronics applications, 
BeSeO3 is investigated via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that operate by approximation of manyelectron 
wavefunction systems via electron density computation (Eq.1) with an associated local density approximation of the 
exchangecorrelation correction to account for electronelectron interactions 3,4,5.
