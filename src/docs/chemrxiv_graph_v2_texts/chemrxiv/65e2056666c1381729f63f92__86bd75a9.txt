precursors for desulfurative borylations.29,30 Aryl alkyl thioethers have also been 
reported as substrates, with full selectivity for borylation of the aryl sidechain 
(Figure 1A).31,32 While these methods commonly display good functional group 
tolerance and wide substrate scopes, transitionmetal based procedures can be costly 
as well as create problems in, e.g., the pharmaceutical industry where removal of trace 
metal residues from the final products is critical.33 For this reason, cost effective, 
simple, and metal free synthetic procedures are in high demand.
