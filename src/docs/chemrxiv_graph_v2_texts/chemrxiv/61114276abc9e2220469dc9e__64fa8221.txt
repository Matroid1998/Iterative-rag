Description:
A novel allcarboatomic molecule that has been generated and characterized recently.

Text:
Cyclo18carbon (C18) is a novel allcarboatomic molecule that has been generated 
and characterized recently 1,2. This allotrope of carbon has attracted considerable 
attention in the field of chemistry and material science since it has been observed in 
condensed phase 339, and a large number of theoretical explorations on its 
electronic structure 35, aromaticity 4,612, optical and spectroscopic properties 
5,1315, molecular interaction 16,17, potential applications in molecular devices 
8,1821, as well as multiple properties of its analogues 79,11,14,15,22 have been 
reported in succession. However, there is currently no way to obtain an isolate 
product of C18 and its purecarbon analogues due to their extreme chemical activity.
