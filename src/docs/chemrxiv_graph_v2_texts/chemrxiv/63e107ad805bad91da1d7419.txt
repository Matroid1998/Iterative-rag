Description:
Used to control the shape and size of crystals.

The ability to grow uniform and monodisperse crystals is also challenging.2022 
Controlling crystal uniformity and morphology is important for applications such as 
nanoparticles, photonic crystals, and quantum dots.2325 These applications include drug 
delivery, display technology, and optical switches, to name a few.2629 Seeding and 
additives have been used to shape crystals.3033 Organic additives or modulators can 
coordinate selectively the facets of a growing crystal and can affect the morphology, 
dimension, and crystallographic structure. For example, amino acids have been used to 
control the shape and size of crystals.3437 Weissbuch, Addadi, Lahav, and Leiserowitz 
have shown that the crystal morphology of glycine can be controlled by chiral modulators 
such as (S)amino acids and (R)amino acids.
