Description:
Compounds of ABX3 composition, where A is a small monovalent cation, B is a divalent metal cation, and X is a halide.

Text:
The favourable optoelectronic properties of halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), such as their energetic 
tunability,1,2 fast radiative rates,3 and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs)4 make them 
attractive for a variety of optoelectronic applications.5 Those include lightemitting diodes,6 lasers,7 
photovoltaics,8 photodetectors,9 photocatalysis,10,11 and quantum light sources.1214 In general, halide 
perovskites are of ABX3 composition, where A is a small monovalent cation, such as Cs, B is a divalent 
metal cation, most commonly Pb2, and X is a halide, (Cl, Br, or I).

Description:
Highly ionic compounds resulting in rapid reactions compared to covalently bound NCs.

Text:
Here, the 
reaction temperature impacts the resultant NC size, but the highly ionic nature of halide perovskites results 
in a much more rapid reaction compared to more covalently bound IIVI or IIIV NCs, and thus the 
nucleation and growth processes cannot be temporally separated.1,21 Further, strongly confined NCs cannot 
be synthesised by simply lowering the temperature, as  140 C, mixtures of cubic NCs and nanoplatelets 
can be observed.22 Recently, strongly confined undoped NCs have been reported and obtained either 
directly via precursor modification23,24 or through postsynthetic purification processes.25 To this point, no 
generalisable synthesis method exists for doped NCs that allows for the same size control and NC 
monodispersity as their undoped counterparts.
