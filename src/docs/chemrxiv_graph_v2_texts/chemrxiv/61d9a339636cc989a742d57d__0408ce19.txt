With the PowertoX technology the possibility arises to convert surplus fluctuating renewable 
2 
electricity into chemical energy. Especially the storage of electrical energy in synthetic natural gas 
3 
(SNG) via the PowertoGas process (PtG) is a promising option for temporal decoupling of energy 
4 
availability and demand.13 Therefore, H2 is produced from electrical energy via water electrolysis, 
5 
which is subsequently used for methanation of carbon oxides available from various sources. For 
6 
instance, by utilizing industrial exhaust gases as carbon sources the potential to convert highly 
7 
concentrated CO2 into CH4 directly at the emitting spot reduces the effort for CO2 separation prior 
8 
to hydrogenation. However, these exhaust gases may also contain CO, i.e.
