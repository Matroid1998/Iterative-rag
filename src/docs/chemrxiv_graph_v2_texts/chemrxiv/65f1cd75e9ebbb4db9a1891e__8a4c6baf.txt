Description:
Perovskite-related compounds studied in heterogeneous catalysis.

Text:
AMO3 perovskiterelated compounds represent probably one of the most studied types of 
mixed oxides in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The extraordinary compositional 
flexibility of the perovskite structure allows tailoring the oxidation state and the Mcation 
environment to modulate their catalytic performance. They are considered an alternative 
to replace noble metals in several catalytic formulations with potential application in a 
variety of reactions, most of them redox processes. CO oxidation is an example of an 
important environmental protection process, as well as a model reaction to study catalyst 
mechanisms. Lanthanidebased perovskites have been widely studied as catalysts for carbon monoxide 
oxidation.
