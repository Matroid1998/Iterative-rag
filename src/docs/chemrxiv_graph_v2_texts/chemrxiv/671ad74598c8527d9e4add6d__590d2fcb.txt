Description:
Ions that undergo redox reactions due to nonbonding 2p orbitals at the Fermi level.

Text:
used advanced Xray
characterization and computational techniques to develop a deeper mechanistic understanding of
this reaction, proving that the highvalent redox reaction was O2O redox stabilized by an
electron hole polaron on the oxygen as opposed to structural rearrangement mediated by the
formation of an OO dimer.9 The formation of O in NMO was further confirmed using electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR).16 Moreover, it is the O2 ions bordering the ordered vacancy that
undergo this redox reaction because their nonbonding 2p orbitals are at the Fermi level and are
thus first to oxidize.9,1214 The ordered vacancy is central (a design principle) to the reversible and
lowhysteresis highvalent redox behavior in NMO.
