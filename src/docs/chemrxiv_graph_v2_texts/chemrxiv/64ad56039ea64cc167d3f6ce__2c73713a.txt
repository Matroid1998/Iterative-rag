Description:
A thermoplastic polymer that can be processed using filament-fed MEW 3D printers.

To keep expanding the versatility of 
MEW, it is essential to increase the range of processable materials8, 10. Until the recent development of 
filamentfed MEW 3D printers1113, thermally degradable polymers have been problematic to process. Our 
recent opensource MEW printer (termed the MEWron)11 allows the replacement of traditional pneumatic
driven extrusion and syringelike reservoirs with gearbased extrusion systems and filamentbased feeding. These modifications reduce the volume of molten material and minimize the risk of thermal degradation, 
allowing the processing of polymers with high melting temperature such as polydioxanone13, polylactic 
acid11 and thermoplastic polyurethane11. Filamentdriven MEW printers also provide opportunities to 
increase the heating temperature for processing, for polymers with higher melting points.
