Description:
A component of biocompatible, stimuli-responsive polymer systems that degrade under acidic conditions and enzyme exposure.

Although IO CAs are not 
predisposed to stimuliresponsive activity, polymer 
functionalization has been able to induce tuneable, 
stimulitriggered 
relaxivity 
changes(1). PSs, 
nanoparticle vesicles formed from the selfassembly 
of 
amphiphilic 
block 
copolymers, 
can 
co
encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
drugs(5), which could enable the future addition of 
therapeutics alongside IO CAs. Previously, our lab has developed highly 
biocompatible, stimuliresponsive PSs made from 
hyaluronic acid (HA) and polylactic acid (PLA)(6,7). HAPLA PSs degrade under acidic conditions and 
upon exposure to enzymes like hyaluronidase or 
hexosaminidase A. Building on this, we co
encapsulated ultrasmall IO nanoparticles (USPIONs) 
into HA(5kDa)PLA(15 kDa) PSs with bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) as a model protein to enable 
nanoparticle tracking via MRI. Our work lays the 
foundation for theranostic PSs for simultaneous 
protein delivery and disease monitoring.
