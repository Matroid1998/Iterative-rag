Description:
Monitored in experiments for transient and two-dimensional electronic spectra in vapor form.

Text:
Early seminal work in actionbased experiments by Marcus demonstrated the acquisition 
of transient and twodimensional electronic spectra of Rb vapor by monitoring modulations in the 
fluorescence signal as a function of the pulse delay times.17,18 More recently, Brixner reported 2D 
electronic action spectra of neutral species in the gas phase generated in molecular beams and 
detected with mass spectrometry via photoionization.19,20 Stienkemeier has likewise measured 2D 
electronic action spectra via photoionization of neutral gasphase species using He nanodroplet 
techniques.21,22 In related studies, Allison has directly measured electronic transient absorption 
spectra of neutrals produced in molecular beams using cavity enhancement and frequencycomb 
laser sources.23,24 Collectively, this impressive growing volume of studies are opening new 
avenues for unraveling fundamental molecular interactions and dynamics.
