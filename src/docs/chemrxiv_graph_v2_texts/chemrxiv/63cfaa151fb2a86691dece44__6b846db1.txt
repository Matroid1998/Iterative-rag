Description:
Serves as a substrate for grafting with Rh(COD)(DIA), showing changes in IR bands.

of 
Rh through a second grafting step using Rh(COD)(DIA) (Figure 1a). IR spectroscopy was used 

to monitor the grafting process (Figure 1b) grafting of Rh(COD)(DIA) on MnIISiO2 shows 
a decrease in intensity of the surface silanols and the appearance of similar IR bands as 
observed during grafting on silica (vide supra). Upon treatment under H2 at 400 oC, all organic 
ligands are removed and the surface silanols are regenerated (Figure 1b). This material is 
henceforth denoted RhMnSiO2. TEM shows the formation of significantly smaller 
nanoparticles for RhMnSiO2 centered at 1.9 nm (Figure 1c), when compared to monometallic 
RhSiO2, which already suggests a substantial influence of Mn on the nanoparticle structure.
