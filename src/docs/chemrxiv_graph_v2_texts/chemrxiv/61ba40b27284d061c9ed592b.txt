Description:
Materials used for pipeline coatings due to their good adhesion performance but are susceptible to moisture-induced degradation in wet environments.

Text:
Despite being primary components for pipeline 
coatings due to their good adhesion performance, epoxy materials are susceptible to moistureinduced 
degradation in wet environments 9, 10. To provide a nearideal protection against hydration, 
hydrophobic polymer structures are commonly added to the coating system as exterior layers 11, 12. Yet, we do not fully understand failures that are witnessed on either single or multilayer coatings 13, 
14.
