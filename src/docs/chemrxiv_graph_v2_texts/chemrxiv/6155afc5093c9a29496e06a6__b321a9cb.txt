Description:
Commonly used in precursors for CVD and ALD processes, though nitrogen-coordinated compounds remain unexplored.

Text:
Even though operational modes and conditions of MOCVD and ALD 
processes differ, their complementary and precise applicability for the deposition of a broad 
range of thin film materials have made them industrially indispensable in fields like 
microelectronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics.6 Choosing the right precursor, namely a 
compound that is volatilized during the process to serve as chemical source for the target 
material, for a specific application is of crucial importance hereby The precursor needs to meet 
demanding requirements such as high thermal stability, sufficient volatility, high but 
controllable reactivity and lastly nonetching behavior.3,4,7 Reviewing the list of commonly 
used Co precursors, it becomes apparent that allnitrogen or predominantly nitrogen 
coordinated compounds are widely unexplored in terms of their general suitability as precursors 
and in terms of actual CVDALD process development.
