Description:
Act as molecular scissors in bioorthogonal reactions with transcyclooctenes.

Text:
The bioorthogonal elimination of transcyclooctenes (TCO) 
triggered by click reaction with 1,2,4,5tetrazines (Tz) has gained 
significant attention due to exceptional reaction kinetics and 
molecular versatility.6 As pioneered by Robillard et al., TCO 
modified with a carbamate moiety in an allylic position (release
TCO, rTCO) undergoes a 1,4elimination upon inverse electron 
demand DielsAlder (IEDDA) reaction with Tz and subsequent 
postclick tautomerization, ultimately leading to the clicktriggered 
release of an amine or aminofunctionalized molecule (clickto
release).7 To expand the scope of Tz as molecular scissors to 
the activation of caged alcohols and phenols, vinyl ethers have 
been 
introduced 
as 
bioorthogonal 
reactants
