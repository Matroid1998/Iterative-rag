Description:
Polymorphs with specific solubility curves and relative stability in solution.

Text:
Expanding on a pre
vious contribution focused on the thermodynamics of
liquidliquid phase separations in systems of disordered
peptides,17 we use a limited number of equilibrium
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (in this case 8
10) to efficiently estimate polymorphspecific solubility
curves, relative stability and limit of solution stability
of Lglutamic acid (LGA) polymorphs.
