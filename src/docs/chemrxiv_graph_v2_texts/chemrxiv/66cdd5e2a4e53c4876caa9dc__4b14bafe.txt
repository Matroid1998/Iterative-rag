Description:
Studied using classical MD modeling to increase numerical study possibilities.

However,
since classical MD modeling remains one of the main tools
for studying the properties of barrier materials at the
nanoscale, the creation of a force field for selenium oxyan
ions will significantly increase the possibilities of numerical
studies 10, 11. So far, we know one attempt to model a
crystal with selenate ions using classical MD 12, but that
interatomic potential lacks compatibility with other force

fields. Also, some parameters for selenium coincide with
the sulfur parameters. In this study, we develop an optimized classical force
field for selenium oxyanions (SeO42, SeO32) based on
the ab initio and experimental data.
