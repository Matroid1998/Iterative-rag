Description:
Involved in dissociation and adsorption processes modeled by quantum simulation methods.

Text:
Quantum simulation methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), are necessary to
model the bond breaking inherent in hydrogen dissociation and adsorption.36 DFT remains
one of the most popular modeling methods in condensed matter physics, computational
chemistry, and materials science, and has been widely used in studies of the physical and
structural properties of Pu (e.g., Refs. 7,8). While a comprehensive explanation of plu
toniums magnetism has yet to be oered, plutonium does not exhibit a bulk magnetic
moment9 and antiferromagnetic (AFM) models yield structural properties comparable to
experiments.10
Surface hydriding studies are generally framed in terms of low (single molecule per surface
unit) vs. high (nearing full monolayer) coverage.

(111) surfaces of Pu have all been conducted at low coverage conditions.36,1113 High
