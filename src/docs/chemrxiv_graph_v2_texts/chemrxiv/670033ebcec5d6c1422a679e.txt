Solidstate batteries (SSBs) are recently receiving considerable attention in the scientific 
27 
community because of their potential to outperform conventional lithiumion batteries.1,2 The 
28 
potential advantages of SSBs originate from their solid nature and singleion conductivity, 
29 
improved safety and the possibility of efficient cell stacking (bipolar stacking). 1 SSBs will likely 
30 
only overcome conventional lithiumion batteries in terms of energy density, if they feature low
31 
potential, highenergydensity anodes such as Si (ref. 3) or Limetal anodes. 4,5 Most highly
32 
conducting solid electrolytes decompose at the low potentials of Si and Li metal anodes.

Description:
A metal that is irreducible or fully reduced and thermodynamically stable against low-potential anodes.

68 The 
33 
decomposition into solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) entails irreversible Liloss  particularly an 
34 
issue for industrially attractive zeroLiexcess battery cells.9 Irreversible Li loss from SEI formation 
35 
may be mediated in three ways (i) by limiting the contact area between the solidelectrolyte and 
36 
anode10,11, (ii) by adding sacrificial Li agents such as for instance Li3N to the cathode 12,13 or (iii) 
37 
by designing solid electrolytes which are thermodynamically stable at the operating potentials of 
38 
lowpotential anodes. 39 
Irreducible or fully reduced phases are thermodynamically stable against Li metal and are thus 
40 
inherently irreducible against lowpotential anodes. Irreducible refers to all elements (except for 
41 
Li) in the material being in their lowest possible formal oxidation state (i.e.
