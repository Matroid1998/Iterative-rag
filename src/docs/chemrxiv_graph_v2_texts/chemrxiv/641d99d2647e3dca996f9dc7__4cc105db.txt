Description:
Single-phase form that can be quenched from 7.7 GPa and 770-820 K using nanocrystalline wZnO.

However, the use of 
nanocrystalline wZnO allows singlephase rsZnO to be quenched from 7.7 GPa and 770820 K 
2022. Crystallographic features of the structure 1416,2124, functional properties 4,5,8,15,22 and 
thermal expansion 21,25,26 of simple and complex metastable oxide systems remain a subject of 
particular attention due to future prospects for their practical application. At the same time,
