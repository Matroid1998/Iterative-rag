Description:
A component in colloidal nanoparticles used for selforganization into functional materials.

Text:
The selforganization of colloidal nanoparticles (gold, silica, polystyrene) into intricate andor 
periodical structure is a crucial area in colloidal sciences due to their potential to make new 
functional material.1,2 Selfassemblies can be broadly classified into equilibrium and outof
equilibrium types. Equilibrium assemblies form thermodynamically stable, highly periodic 
structures that can be used in functional materials like colloidal photonic crystals,3,4 metamaterials5
7 exhibiting high (n  3) or negative refractive indices,814 and optoelectronic metamaterials based 
on quantum dot superlattices showing superfluorescence.15,16 On the other hand, outof
equilibrium, or active, selfassemblies respond dynamically to external stimuli (chemical, 
electrical, optical, magnetic) and offer the advantage of being reconfigurable. In both types of 
colloidal selfassembly, understanding the interactions between individual components is essential 
for controlling their spatial arrangement and engineering these materials.

Description:
Forms hexagonal clusters in optical matter.

OM is 
a form of matter in which nanoparticles selforganize through light matter interactions, referred to 
as optical bonds, resulting in periodical arrangements. These optical bonds originate from multiple 
scattering interactions between colloidal particles.19,2225 As a consequence, OMs can be engineered 
and reconfigured onfly by modifying the input light properties (wavelength, polarization, 
intensity profile,).26,27 Many examples of optical matter have been created in the literature, such 
as dumbbellshaped assemblies in gold particles, chainlike structures in silver particles, and 
hexagonal clusters in polystyrene particles.23,29,30 However, detailed information on the structure 
andor their properties is often missing, particularly when the density of particle increases, or the 
size of particle is decreased.
