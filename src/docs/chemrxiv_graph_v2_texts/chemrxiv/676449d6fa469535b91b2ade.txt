Description:
Ligands studied for their stabilizing effects on AuNPs.

Text:
Moreover, thiolbound AuNPs often exhibit 
low stability under various conditions, leading to the degradation of their properties and function over 
time.8 Many other ligands are also studied for their stabilizing effects, such as thioethers,9 selenols,10 
amines,11 phosphinates,12 isocyanides,13 and alkynyls,14 but they often suffer from relatively low 
binding strengths toward AuNP surface.
