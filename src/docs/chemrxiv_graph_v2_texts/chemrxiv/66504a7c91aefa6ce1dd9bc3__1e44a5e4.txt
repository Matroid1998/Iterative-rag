Description:
A nitrogen-containing aromatic with strong electron-donating properties.

Text:
RISC requires a small singlettriplet energy gap (EST) that can be modulated through a suitable 
molecular design involving donoracceptor (DA) units linked by a system spatially separat
ing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) resulting into intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).1,1517 Common D motives are 
nitrogencontaining aromatics like carbazole, diphenylamine, phenoxazine and other deriva
tives due to their strong electrondonating ability, stable and high triplet states.
