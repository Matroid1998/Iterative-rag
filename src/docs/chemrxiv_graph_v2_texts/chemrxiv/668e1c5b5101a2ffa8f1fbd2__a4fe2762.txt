Description:
A C2 compound that can be produced from CO2 electroreduction using copper-based catalysts.

Text:
In contrast with conventional commercial methods, 
43 
such as CO2 hydrogenation or the FisherTropsch processes, CO2 ER can be conducted under ambient 
44 
temperatures and pressures using modular, scalable and decentralized units14. Copperbased catalysts are 
45 
the most selective materials known to unlock CO2 ER towards C2 compounds, such as ethanol and 
46 
ethylene10,1517 and other multicarbon hydrocarbons. And compared to other metal catalysts, copper 
47 
exhibits a relatively lower selectivity towards hydrogen evolution, leading to unmatched Faradaic 
48 
efficiencies for CO2 ER18. 49 
In the last two decades, numerous studies1921 attempted to optimize the catalytic activity, the energy 
50 
efficiency, and the selectivity of copper.
