Description:
A liquid phase solvent used for the absorption of CO2.

Text:
Absorption technologies involve the absorption of CO2 by a liquid
phase solvent,17 such as monoethanolamine (MEA),15 or ionic liquids.68,16 Adsorption 
technologies use solid adsorbents to sequester CO2 by physically adsorbing it to the surface, i.e., 
by Van der Waals interactions, or chemically adsorbing it to the surface, as is common in amine
functionalized solids.914 
One adsorbent material, Calgary Framework 20 (CALF20), is a MOF with excellent thermal 
and hydrolytic stability, high CO2 capacity, and selectivity for CO2 over H2O and N2.1 CALF20 
is stable to steam for more than 450,000 cycles1 and does not lose surface area after adsorbing 
water at 175 C and 672 kPa.2 These features make it an attractive alternative to aminebased CO2 
adsorbents, and as such, it has garnered significant attention in the literature.113 Specifically, 
CALF20 is a Znbased MOF Zn2(1,2,4triazolate)2(oxalate), which is commercially scalable,1 
and the hydrophobic nature of the surface eliminates the need for a drying step before CO2 
capture.14 CALF20 adsorbs CO2 weakly, with a binding energy of around 35 kJmol,1 which in 
many cases is lower than the binding energies of aminefunctionalized, chemisorptive MOFs (
130 to 180 kJmol)15 thereby providing an energetic advantage during desorption when compared
