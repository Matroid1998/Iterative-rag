Description:
A compound involved in oxidative functionalization to replace the CH bond with a CN bond.

Photoredox catalysis employing metalbased as well as organic photocatalysts 
has developed into a modern, powerful toolbox for synthetic organic chemistry.1 The direct 
oxidative functionalization of benzene and its derivatives to replace the CH bond by a CN bond 
is a challenging and synthetically highly useful reaction. It represents a shortcut to the widely 
utilized BuchwaldHartwig amination which requires prefunctionalized starting materials and 
transition metal catalysts. Nicewicz and coworkers developed the oxidative amination of 
electronrich arenes utilizing acridinium based photocatalysts in combination with oxygen and 
TEMPO as an additional additive (Scheme 1A).2 Initially, the transformation was limited to 
electronrich arenes such as anisole but was not performed with benzene or electrondeficient 
derivatives, since the oxidation potentials are too high.
