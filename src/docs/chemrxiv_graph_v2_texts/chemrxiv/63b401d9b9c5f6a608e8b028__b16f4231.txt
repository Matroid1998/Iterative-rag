Description:
One of the most important silicone products.

Silicone polymers are widely used in applications ranging 
from lubricants, construction  automotive materials, 
electronics, medical formulations  engineered materials.1,2 In 
2020, the worlds production of silicones was over 8 million 
tons, representing a market value at 15.1 billion USD.3 Silicone 
polymers consist of SiOSi bound highly resistant backbones. SiO bonds are longer than CO bonds and the bond angle for Si
OSi is wider than that in carbon analogues. These materials are 
thus thermally stable, mostly chemically inert (except to strong 
acids and bases) and highly flexible.3 Recycling of these high
value inorganic polymers has become strategic for both 
environmental and economic reasons. Polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) is one of the most important 
silicone products.
