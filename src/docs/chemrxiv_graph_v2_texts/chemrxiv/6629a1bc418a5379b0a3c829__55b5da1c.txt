Description:
A version of ICG evaluated for customized imaging properties.

However, ICG is known for several clinical performance limitations 
including chemical instability in aqueous solution,8 which limits its clinical use to six hours after 
dose reconstitution, and moderate susceptibility to photobleaching.9 In addition, ICG self
aggregation or albumin association means the spectral properties, including fluorescence 
quantum yield and electronic excited state lifetime are concentration dependent.10 Efforts to 
mitigate these drawbacks have included strategies that encapsulate ICG within protective 
nanocapsules such as liposomes, proteins, or hyperbranched polymers.11 There are also 
preclinical and clinical protocols that combine ICG with other fluorescent dyes with different 
wavelengths for multicolor imaging and sensing applications.12 13 14 The feasibility of this 
approach is enhanced by ongoing advances in camera technology that enables advanced 
methods of multicolor and lifetime imaging.15 16 
As part of an ongoing project to develop structural analogues of ICG with customized imaging 
properties, 9 17 we decided to evaluate the pentamethine version of ICG which we call 
Indocyanine Blue (ICB, see Scheme 1).
