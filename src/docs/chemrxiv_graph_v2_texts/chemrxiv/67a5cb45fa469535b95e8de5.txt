Description:
A signature constituent of living matter on our planet.

Text:
Since the identification of carbon containing molecules as signature constituent of living matter on 
our planet (vis vitalis), deciphering the structure and function of natural products (NPs) has guided 
the development of organic chemistry and remains an essential source of inspiration for the 
development of new medicines.112 However, while the atom connectivity of NPs can be assigned 
by a variety of methods ranging from degradation chemistry to Mass Spectrometry and NMR 
spectroscopy, as of today determining the configuration of individual stereocenters in NPs (3D
structure) remains challenging and requires techniques such as Xray crystallography and 
chiroptical spectroscopy often combined with derivatization,1318 and sometimes total synthesis to 
confirm or correct the initial stereochemical assignment.1927
