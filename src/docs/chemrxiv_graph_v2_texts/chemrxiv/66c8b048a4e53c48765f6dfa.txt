Description:
A nucleophilic compound that undergoes alkylation.

Text:
These strategies suffer from scope 
limitations and ideality for largescale process development 
and manufacture. The alkylation approach requires a reasona
bly nucleophilic aniline, which limits the scope to electronneu
tral and rich arenes. Such alkylation results in a low yield when 
an electrondeficient arene is employed, as shown in a recent 
patent,10 where aniline 1 undergoes alkylation with bromoglu
tarimide to afford 2 in a poor 19 yield. While enabling the in
itial activity studies, such a strategy is unfit for process scale 
deliveries.
