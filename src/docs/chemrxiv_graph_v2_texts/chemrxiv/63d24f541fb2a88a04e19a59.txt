Description:
Reduced by semiconductor quantum dots in photoredox catalysis.

Text:
Visible light photoredox catalysis with transition metal complexes (mainly based on Ir and Ru 
complexes) and organic photocatalysts has developed rapidly during the last two decades, resulting in 
impressive development in the field of organic synthesis.17 Besides, semiconductor quantum dots 
(QDs) start to appear as efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction810 and H2 production,1113 as well 
as at promoting synthetic organic transformations, as demonstrated by some of us14 and several others 
groups,1521 relying in the majority of cases on CdS and CdSe QDs. The different main types of core and coreshell QDs structures used in photoredox catalysis are 
presented in Figure 1.
