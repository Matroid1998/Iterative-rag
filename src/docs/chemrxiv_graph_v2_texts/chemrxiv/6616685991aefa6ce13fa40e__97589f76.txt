Description:
Reacts with epoxides to form betaine I and phosphine oxides.

Text:
Mechanistically, the accelerated curing of the epoxyphenol reaction 
is explained by the initial formation of betaine I (Scheme 1) by nucleophilic attack 
of the phosphine from the side opposite to the oxygen of the oxirane group onto 
the sterically less hindered carbon atom of the oxirane ring. In turn, the Brnsted
basic zwitterion I undergoes an acidbase reaction with the phenols to form ion 
pair II. The resulting phenolates are more reactive with epoxy groups than 
phenols, which explains the faster curing. 14. Scheme 1. The reaction of phosphines with epoxides resulting in the curing of 
epoxyphenol formulations (above) and in phosphine oxides and alkenes (below)
