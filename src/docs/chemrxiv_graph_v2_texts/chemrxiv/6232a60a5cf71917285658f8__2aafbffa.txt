Description:
Forms kinetically arrested inverted bilayers with Er(III) at the dodecane-water interface.

Text:
Dihexadecylphosphate (DHDP) 
forms an insoluble monolayer on water, and it has been used as an analogue of HDEHP for this 
purpose.12, 20, 37 At the dodecanewater interface, kinetically arrested inverted bilayer of DHDP
Er(III) complexes has been observed.13, 37 This phenomena was proposed to underlie the 
micellization in the organic phases after LLE.13 
Here, we show that the inverted bilayers of DHDP can be created at airaqueous interface, 
allowing kinetic and temperaturedependent studies. Using synchrotron Xray scattering 
techniques and VSFG, we first show that the inverted bilayers form with Lu3 but not with Nd3,
