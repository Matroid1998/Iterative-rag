The pseudoelement concept is a common approach to rationally 
prepared 
isoelectronic 
structures 
with 
different 
chemical 
compositions. In its most general formulation, the pseudoelement 
concept states that isoelectronic atoms form equal numbers of 
bonds. Hence, Zintl phases are expected to retain their structure 
upon isoelectronic replacement of some or all atoms.11 For instance, 
in the ternary phase CaAgSb (8 vef.u), the Ag and Sb atoms could be 
simultaneously replaced by Mg and Ge atoms to form isostructural 
and isoelectronic phase CaMgGe.23 Alternatively, the divalent Mg 
atom in CaMgGe or EuMgGe phases may be replaced by a 
combination of monovalent Ag and trivalent Al, i.e., CaAg1xAlxGe or 
EuAg1xAlxGe systems, to generate isoelectronic pseudoternaries 
CaAg0.5Al0.5Ge or EuAg0.5Al0.5Ge. This is a more general approach to 
a.
