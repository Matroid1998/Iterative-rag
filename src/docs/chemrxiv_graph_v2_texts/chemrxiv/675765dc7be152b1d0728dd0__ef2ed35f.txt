Description:
An opioid drug whose negative effects can be minimized by pharmacological activation of D4Rs.

Text:
Drugs targeting D2Rs and D3Rs can alter 
locomotor function and motivated states, and D2Rs are a primary target for antipsychotic drugs.3, 
4 In contrast, the activity of D4Rs located in the HC and the PFC influence exploratory behavior, 
attention, and performance in cognitive tasks such as novel object recognition and inhibitory 
avoidance.47 Activating D4Rs could be a route for a potential treatment for cognitive deficits 
associated with attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.812 Preclinical 
studies showed D4R agonists improved performance cognitive tasks, such as novel object 
recognition tasks, 5trial repeated acquisition inhibitory avoidance tasks, and social recognition 
tasks.6, 13, 14 Recent studies indicate that pharmacological activation of D4Rs could also minimize 
the negative effects of opioid drugs such as morphine.15, 16 Antagonizing D4Rs might be helpful in 
treating LDOPAinduced dyskinesias and substance use disorders (SUDs), particularly
