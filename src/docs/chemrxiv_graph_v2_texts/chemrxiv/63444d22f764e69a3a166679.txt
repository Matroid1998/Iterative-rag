Description:
Molten alkali halides become corrosive in the presence of impurities.

Text:
Moltensalt reactor (MSR) concepts are ad
vanced nuclear reactor designs that benefit from
lower operating pressures and higher heat trans
fer efficiency compared with traditional water
cooled designs 1, 2. Molten salts are not only
utilized as a coolant fluid but also as a carrier of
the fissile material. These applications require
stringent characteristics of the salts to insure tol
erance of the reactor materials to the extreme en
vironment of high temperature and irradiation. Online monitoring of the salt chemistry in
working MSRs is imperative for the safe and ef
ficient operation of these reactors for a number
of reasons. First, molten alkali halides become
corrosive in the presence of impurities.
