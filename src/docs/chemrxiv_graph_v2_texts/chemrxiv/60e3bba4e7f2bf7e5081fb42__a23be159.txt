On the other hand, fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) have exhibited considerable potential 
for a range of practical applications including biological applications,16,17 solid state lighting18 and 
sensing.19 For the last decade, onestep synthesized CNPs have been researched broadly due to 
their simplicity in preparation20, ease of dispersion in water21 and superior optical performance.22 
The majority of the reported CNPs have been utilizing surface functionalization strategies such as 
decomposing carbon precursors containing other surface functionalization moieties in one pot.20 
CNPs sensing applications have especially been extensively researched due to the CNPs surface 
functionalities which play dual roles with the analytes. Firstly, the surface functionalities recognize 
the analytes by binding the analytes on the surface of the CNPs. Simultaneously, the analytes on
