Description:
A species produced during surface reactions that can interact with materials and induce local restructuring.

Text:
Heterogeneous catalysis is governed by a concerted and
intricate interplay of several processes that take place at
multiple time and length scales.14 The chemical envi
ronment that exists during catalyst operation as well as
the kinetics of structural changes create configurations of
typically unknown local geometries and chemistry. While
surface reactions that break and make chemical bonds
occur at time scales of picoseconds, they produce species
such as carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen, that interact with
the material initially placed in the reactor and may in
duce its local restructuring along with changes in the
reactivity in the scale of hours, days, or even longer.
