Description:
Studied for schistosomicidal activity.

Text:
Bromo and methoxy ringdisubstituted ethyl phenylcyanoacrylate (PCA) was used in 
synthesis of thiazacridine derivatives as anticancer agents against breast and hematopoietic 
neoplastic cells 1; in synthesis of a novel thiazolidinedione and evaluation of its 
modulatory effect on IFN, IL6, IL17A, and IL22 production in PBMCs from 
rheumatoid arthritis patients 2; in synthesis and antiinflammatory activity of new 
arylidenethiazolidine2,4diones as PPAR ligands 3; in preparation of 2,4
thiazolidinedione derivatives having hypoglycemic activity 4; in synthesis and study of 
biological activity of novel acridinylidene and benzylidene thiazolidinediones 5; in 
synthesis and study of antiinflammatory activity of new thiazolidine2,4diones, 4
thioxothiazolidinones, and 2thioxoimidazolidinones 6; in synthesis and 
studyschistosomicidal activity of new substituted thioxoimidazolidine compounds 7; in 
studies of behavior of Schistosoma Mansoni adult worms maintained in vitro towards 
imidazolidinone derivatives 8; in synthesis of 1,3,5trisubstituted2
thioxoimidazolidinones 9; in studies of stereochemistry of arylidenecyanoacetic acids and 
arylarylideneacetonitriles 10.
