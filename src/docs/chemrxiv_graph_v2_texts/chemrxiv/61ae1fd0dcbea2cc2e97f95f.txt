Description:
Tetrahedrally coordinated with phosphorus in boron phosphide.

Text:
Boron phosphide BP is a hard (Vickers hardness HV  30 GPa 1) refractory (melting temperature 
at ambient pressure is 2840 K 2) and lowcompressible (300K bulk modulus is 174 GPa 3) 
wide bandgap (Eg  2.1 eV 4) semiconductor with outstanding chemical and hightemperature 
stability that makes it a promising material for a wide range of applications 5. Under ambient 
conditions, BP crystallizes in cubic sphalerite (F43m) structure with boron and phosphorus 
tetrahedrally coordinated to each other. Another tetrahedral structure of boron phosphide, hexagonal 
wurtzite (P63mc) polymorph, has also been reported 6, however, in the literature there is no data 
on the structure and properties of this phase.
