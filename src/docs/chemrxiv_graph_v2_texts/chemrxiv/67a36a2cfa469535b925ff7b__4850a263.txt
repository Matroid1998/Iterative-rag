Description:
Used as a spin trap in EPR spectroscopy to obtain significant signals.

Text:
The examination via EPR spectroscopy requires a spin trap system using 5,5
dimethyl1pyrrolineNoxide (DMPO) for obtaining significant signals, while the sulfur 
studies showed stable radicals without a spin trap. From the resulting data, we were able to 
conclude that although radicals are formed in the (SN)xIL system, they are shortlived and not 
detectable without DMPO. Here, the reaction of EMImOAc with tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4, S415N4) will be 
investigated in detail, at first using the same spectroscopic methods as in our previous study.1 
S4N4 is interesting because it is an important precursor for the polymerization of (SN)x in which
