Description:
Formed from aniline in a reaction mechanism.

Text:
In the vapor phase process NB is fed 
with hydrogen into a tubular reactor containing a supported Cu catalyst at 270 290 C and 15 bar in the 
presence of a 91 (H2NB) excess of hydrogen.2 In the liquid phase process, the capability for utilization of 
reaction heat (more than 500 kJ mol1) is much higher due to higher heat transfer coefficient, and supported 
noble metals (palladium and platinum) are employed.3 
Given the industrial and economic relevance of the process, plentiful academic and industrial research is 
still conducted today to improve the existing processes.4 In 2005, Jackson in collaboration with catalysis 
industrys researchers demonstrated that the Habers threestep reaction mechanism (aniline converted to 
nitrosobenzene, the latter to phenylhydroxylamine, and phenylhydroxylamine to aniline) is wrong.5 The 
newly suggested reaction mechanism indicates formation of PhN(OH) (nitrobenzene) as surface interme
diate.

Description:
A strongly adsorbed intermediate in the formation of aniline.

Text:
In another attempt, a catalyst comprised of 3.7 nm 
Ni nanoparticles dispersed on silica, though more active than Raney Ni, required 90 C because formation 
of aniline only begins when the conversion of the strongly adsorbed nitrosobenzene intermediate is higher 
than 90.7 
In the following, we describe the high and stable activity in the NB reduction to aniline of the reduced form 
(RGONi) of NiGraf, a newly developed metal organic alloy (MORAL) comprised of graphene oxide en
trapped within Ni nanoparticles (GONi).8 Actually consisting of Ni nanoparticles encapsulating GO plate
lets,9 this new class of Nibased catalysts is reproducibly and efficiently obtained through the MORAL 
approach first introduced by Avnir in 2002.10 Since then, widely different molecularly doped metals were 
applied as enhanced catalysts to numerous catalytic conversions.11 Yet, their uptake in catalysis science 
and technology in the subsequent two decades remained surprisingly low, even though metal species
