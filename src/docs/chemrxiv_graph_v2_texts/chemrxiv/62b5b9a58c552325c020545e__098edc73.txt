Description:
Exhibits a lithium ion conductivity of approximately 107 S/cm, making it unsuitable for industrial battery applications.

However, this material classs potential is hampered by the poor understanding of the rel
evant structureproperty relations. This manifests itself in huge deviations in Liion conduc
tivity between theory and experiment. As such, Li3PS4 serves as an illustrating example. Experimental studies report a lithium ion conductivity of approximately 107 Scm1, making
the material unsuitable for industrial battery applications.11 In contrast, an ab initio study
predicts a conductivity of 101 Scm1; a six orders of magnitude deviation from experiment
that would make the material the new record holder in solidstate lithium ion conduction.12
Such huge discrepancies often arise from computational limitations that constrain tractable
system sizes and sampling times.
