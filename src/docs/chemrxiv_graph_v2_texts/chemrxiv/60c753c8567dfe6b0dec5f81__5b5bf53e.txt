Description:
Molecules with olefin bonds that have limited methods available for reduction.

Text:
Selective hydrogenation of olefin bond of conjugated carbonyl 
compounds in the presence of other function groups is an important task in organic 
synthesis. As hydrogen1,2 from gas cylinder is potentially explosive and requires to be 
used with caution in a special apparatus, search for alternative methods to conventional 
hydrogenation procedures such as heterogeneous and homogeneous catalytic transfer 
hydrogenation is still going on. Surprisingly, there are only a few methods available in 
the literature for effecting the reduction of the olefin in ,unsaturated carbonylnitro 
molecules.
