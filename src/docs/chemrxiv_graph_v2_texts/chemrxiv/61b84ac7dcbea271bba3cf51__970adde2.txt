Description:
A 2D covalent graphitic-like structure that has boosted research in materials science.

The increased requirements for highly performing devices raised during the last years 
concerns regarding the supply of raw materials, especially regarding rare metals and 
semiconductors. For this reason, our research focused in the development of new, highly 
efficient materials based on carbon. The development of new synthetic techniques and 
the strong advances in characterization methods enabled a new era in materials science, 
around carbon. From the beginning of the XXI century, the development of graphene, 
nanotubes and fullerenes have boosted this research, with particular focus on 2D 
covalent graphiticlike structures. Later on, the introduction of heteroatoms in these 
graphitic frameworks have paved the way for the development of high performing 
materials in a wide range of applications and devices.
