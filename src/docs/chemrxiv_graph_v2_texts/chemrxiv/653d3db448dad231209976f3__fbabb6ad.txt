Description:
An anionic counterpart in ionic liquids that contributes to their hydrophobic nature.

Text:
The ILs mainly consist of an organic cation (e.g., alkylimidazolium derivatives (MMI), Figure 
1) and an anionic counterpart (e.g., PF6 in Figure 1), and the proper selection of the cation and anion 
determine the hydrophilichydrophobic nature of the ILs. 26 The imidazoliumbased ILs with 
hydrophobic anionic counterparts, such as PF6 or (CF3SO2)2N, form distinct layers with water, which 
helps to separate the REEs from the parent materials via liquidliquid extraction. 18 Besides their use in 
extraction, ILs are now becoming important industrial substances because of their usefulness in nuclear 
fuel reprocessing. 27, 28 They solvate the uranyl complexes 29, 30 and stabilize the unusual oxidation 
states of lanthanides.

Several experimental studies focus on the extraction of REEs using ILs; 3140 however, there are fewer 
theoretical studies for the extraction of REEs with ILs either as extractants or as dilutants. 4146 
Chaumont et al. 41 used classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) to investigate the solvation of Ln3 
cations, where Ln  La, Eu, and Yb, in two different imidazoliumbased roomtemperature ionicliquids 
(RTILs) with PF6 and AlCl4 as the counter anions. Depending on the size of the metal ions, the 
coordination numbers (CN) of PF6 and AlCl4 around the metal ions in the first coordination shell vary. Around 1113 1methyl3butylimidazolium (BMI) cations further surround the first coordination shell. Their study shows smaller cations interact more strongly with the ILs than larger ones.
