Description:
Favored product in methanation using monometallic catalysts.

Text:
Towards this goal, we prepare a series of welldefined, silicasupported 
24 
MGaSiO2 bimetallic catalysts (M  Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir) via Surface Organometallic Chemistry, a 
25 
synthetic approach that generates catalyst structures amenable to detailed (insitu) spectroscopic 
26 
characterization. Notably, all of the prepared bimetallic catalysts show good selectivity for 
27 
methanolDME in CO2 hydrogenation (selectivity  50), while the monometallic cases (MSiO2 
28 
catalysts) favor in all cases methanation (CH4  97). Detailed insitu studies indicate, that Ga readily
