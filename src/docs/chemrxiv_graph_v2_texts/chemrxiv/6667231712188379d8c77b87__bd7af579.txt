A common separation
method for obtaining highpurity PDC is crystallization, which is mediated by added salt
such as sodium chloride.7 The resulting crystal structure of Na(PDC)2 has PDC molecules
oriented with their pyran rings packed against each other and sodium ions bridging between
carboxylic acid groups. This structure suggests the importance of ionmediated interactions
in promoting PDC crystallization; such interactions will depend upon the identity of the
salt added to induce crystallization. Given the complex composition of fermentation broth,
including the presence of multiple different ionic species, further improving separation
