Description:
Aromatic compounds that undergo a wide range of electrophilic substitution reactions.

Text:
As aromatic compounds, porphyrins and related macrocycles undergo a wide range of 
electrophilic substitution reactions, leading to a correspondingly wide range of functionalized 
derivatives.1,2 Less widely appreciated are reactions effecting skeletal rearrangements and 
alterations to the N4 core of the molecules.3,4 Several of these reactions afford exotic macrocycles 
that cannot be readily accessed by other means. An excellent example of such a reaction is the 
ring expansion of a corrole to a 6azahemiporphycene (H2AHP) via interaction with a nitrogen 
atom source.5,6,7,8 A related example involves the ring expansion of a corrole to a 
hemiporphycene.9,10 Several transition metal derivatives of (aza)hemiporphycenes have been 
reported, but by and large their electrochemical, optical and photophysical properties remain 
inadequately explored.
