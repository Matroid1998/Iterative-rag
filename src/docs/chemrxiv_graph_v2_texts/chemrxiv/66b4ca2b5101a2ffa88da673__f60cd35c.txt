Description:
Emitted by algae and plays a pivotal role in cluster formation at coastal regions.

However, to facilitate the cluster formation process, the lowvolatile
acids must react with atmospheric bases such as Ammonia (AM),10 alkylamines (Methy
lamine (MA), Dimethylamine (DMA), Trimethylamine (TMA))11,12 and diamines (Ethylene
diamine (EDA), Putrescine (PUT)).13,14 At coastal regions iodine species emitted by algae
are conceived to play a pivotal role in cluster formation.1517 Depending on the saturation
vapour pressure of the compounds,18,19 Highly Oxygenated organic Molecules (HOMs)20,21
can also inuence cluster formation22,23 and growth.24 Overall, this leads to strongly bound
clusters held together by a combination of hydrogenbonded interactions and electrostatic
interactions. Unfortunately, it is very dicult to measure the initial cluster formation using exper
imental techniques.
