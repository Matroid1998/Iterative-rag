Description:
A gas that is captured using aqueous amine solutions but requires significant energy input.

The carbon dioxide capture problem is of paramount societal im
portance.1,2 Although aqueous amine solutions are currently being 
used to capture CO2, they require significant energy input because 
of the high heat capacity of water and suffer from loss of amines.36 
Porous solidstate materials are being studied for their potential in 
offering a platform for mounting amines and foregoing the heat re
quirement of aqueous solutions.79 In this regard, materials such as 
carbon,7,10 zeolites,11 silica,1215 resins,16,17 covalent organic frame
works,18 and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs),1923 are being in
vestigated as summarized in Table 1, see Table S1 in the Supporting 
Information (SI) for more detailed comparison.7,10,19,2428 At pre
sent, they all fall short of meeting the stringent performance require
ments high uptake capacity, high selectivity, low regeneration en
ergy, fast kinetics, and long cycling lifetime.29,30 We believe that in or
der to solve the CO2 problem, significant efforts are required in un
derstanding the CO2 chemistry in the pores of such materials and in 
using this knowledge to build viable structures.
