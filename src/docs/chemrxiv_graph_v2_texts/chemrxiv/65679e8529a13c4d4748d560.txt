Description:
A powerful oxidizing agent that permeates cell walls and inactivates bacteria by damaging cell constituents.

Among them, there has been considerable interest 
75 
in ozone treatment, and it is seen as an affordable and sustainable alternative (Khanashyam et al., 
76 
2022; Varga and Szigeti, 2016). 77 
Being a powerful oxidizing agent, ozone permeates the cell walls of the bacteria and inactivates 
78 
them by damaging cell constituents (Afonso et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2022). Previous literature 
79 
has proved the ozones potential to increase the shelf life of dairy commodities as an independent 
80 
treatment and with other processing techniques (hurdle technology) (Brodowska et al., 2018; 
81 
Genecya et al., 2020; Sheelamary and Muthukumar, 2011).

Description:
Used in desludge treatment, wastewater processing, food contact surface and air disinfection, biofilm elimination, and reduction of toxins.

In addition, some studies have reported 
82 
minimal effect of this processing technique on the natural parameters of these products 
83 
(Khanashyam et al., 2022; Sert and Mercan, 2021a). However, optimizing factors, such as ozone 
84 
concentration and treatment time, is necessary for each product. Other than the inactivation 
85 
treatment, additional applications of ozone treatment include desludge treatment, wastewater 
86 
processing, food contact surface and air disinfection, biofilm elimination, and reduction of toxins
