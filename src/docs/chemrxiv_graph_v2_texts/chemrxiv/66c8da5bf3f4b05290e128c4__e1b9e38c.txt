Description:
An experimental excipient studied for HME.

Text:
It involves 
the mixing and melting of the excipient and drug with subsequent extrusion.9 Wellknown and 
studied polymers for HME and used in multiple commercial products are, inter alia, 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)1112, HPMC derivates13, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) 
(PVP)14 and poly(vinyl pyrrolidonecovinyl acetate) (P(VPcoVA))15. Apart from these well
established polymers, Soluplus1617 has been introduced specifically for HME and other 
experimental excipients, such as poly(2ethyl2oxazoline)18 and ABA triblock copolymers 
comprising poly(2oxazoline) (POx) and poly(2oxazine) (POzi)19 moieties, have been studied 
for HME more recently. Interestingly, PVP and P(VPcoVA), are structurally similar to 
Soluplus and POxPOzi based polymers, in that they all contain tertiary amide groups in their 
repeating units, which may act as hydrogen bond acceptors (but not Hdonors) for the drug.
