Despite these 
drawbacks, chemoradiotherapy greatly improves mean 3year 
survival rates from 1.9 to 16  compared to radiotherapy alone in 
the case of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agent for 
GBM treatment, temozolomide (TMZ).3 However, rapid develop
ment of TMZ resistance underline the urgent clinical need for bet
ter treatment options, potentially by using alternative active phar
maceutical ingredients (APIs) for GBM chemotherapy.9 
Statins are a family of widely used drugs for the treatment of hy
percholesterolemia.10 They act as inhibitors of 3hydroxy3
methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase thus being po
tent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis.11 However, beyond 
their effects on serum cholesterol levels, recent research effort 
gives increasing evidence on cancer prevention andor treatment 
properties of statins through interactions with essential cellular 
functions such as cell proliferation and differentiation.12 Several
