Description:
A hydrated fluoride used as a precursor in the synthesis of cobalt iron oxyfluoride.

This inevitably limits their performance via scaling relations as all intermediates share a 
MO bond.20 Breaking these scaling relations for enhanced OER performance can be accomplished by 
accessing new reaction mechanisms such as radical oxygen coupling and lattice oxygen involvement, 
and the discovery of new OER catalyst compositions ultimately underpins access to such reaction 
pathways. Numerous synthetic routes have been used to prepare functional transition metal oxyfluorides to 
control the chemical composition with specific fluorination degree, particle size, morphology, and 
stabilization of desired crystal structures2125. In this work, we report on the twostep preparation of a 
new cobalt iron oxyfluoride with a rutile type structure, Co0.5Fe0.5O0.5F1.5, obtained by calcination of 
the hydrated fluoride CoFeF5(H2O)7.
