Description:
Commercially available, inexpensive, and widely used in synthesis.

In this area a notable exception are the reports using HBDan (1,8
naphthalenediaminatoborane) in catalytic CH borylation.46 However, the ArylBDan products 
and ArylBPin compounds are both weakly Lewis acidic at boron. In contrast, BAr9
borabicyclo3.3.1nonane compounds (ArBBN) are more Lewis acidic at boron which enables 
transformations that are not possible using ArB(OR)2ArBDan.79 Furthermore, the 
hydroborane, 9borabicyclo3.3.1nonane, (HBBN)2, is commercially available, inexpensive, 
and widely used in synthesis.10 To date the use of (HBBN)2 in catalytic intermolecular CH 
borylation to form a range of ArBBN compounds is not reported to our knowledge (Fig. 1A),11, 
12 despite the high utility of these products.13
