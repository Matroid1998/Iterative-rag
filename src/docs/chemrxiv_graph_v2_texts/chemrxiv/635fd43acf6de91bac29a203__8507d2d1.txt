Description:
Used in cellular imaging with fluorescent indicators equipped with a tri or tetracarboxylate binding motif.

For example, 
carboxylates can be readily transformed into the corre
sponding ester moiety, which upon crossing the cell mem
brane, can be cleaved to unmask the latent charge via intra
cellular esterase activity.3,4 A notable example is the use of 
this strategy to facilitate uptake of fluorescent indicators for 
calcium, which are equipped with a tri or tetracarboxylate 
binding motif.5,6 Under normal circumstances, it would be 
nearly impossible for a molecule with a net charge of 3 or 
4 to enter the cell. However, calcium indicators for cellular 
imaging are routinely prepared and sold in the acetoxy me
thyl ester form. Beyond the modification of small molecules, 
this approach has extended to facilitate the delivery of func
tional proteins through the conversion of surfaceexposed 
carboxylates to esters.
