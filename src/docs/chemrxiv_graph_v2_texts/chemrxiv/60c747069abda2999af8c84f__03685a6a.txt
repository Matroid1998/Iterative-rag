Description:
A lanthanide element used in single-ion magnets due to its strong spin-orbital coupling and large magnetic anisotropy.

Since the discovery of Mn12Ac,1 singlemolecule magnets 
(SMMs) has been one of the most eyecatching research topics 
due to its fascinating potential applications in ultrashigh 
density storage,2 molecular spintronic3 as well as quantum 
computing.4 In recent years, lanthanide SMMs especially 
monometallic SMMs called singleion magnets (SIMs)5 based 
on trivalent lanthanide ions succeeded in creating lots of 
breakthroughs6 in SMM domain for the intrinsic strong spin
orbital coupling and large magnetic anisotropy of lanthanide 
ions.7 
Inspired by dysprosium metalloceniums,6,8 the rapid 
development of this area has raised a growing desire towards 
rationally achieving highperformance SMMs, especially for the 
airstable SMMs.9,10 To reach this goal, it is critically important 
to wellunderstand the magnetostructural correlations for Dy
SMMs.
