Description:
A species formed by the coordination of dioxygen to metal centers.

Text:
Dioxygen can coordinate to firstrow transition metals (in different oxidation and spin states) with 
several protonation states, and hapticity, leading to e.g. peroxo, superoxo, hydroperoxo or bis
oxo species (see Scheme 1). Although crystal structures exist for all of these species,1,2 the

corresponding complexes are too large for treatment by accurate wavefunction methods like 
CCSD(T) with large basis sets (augccpVQZ or better). This prevents the systematic validation3
