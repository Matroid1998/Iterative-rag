Description:
A synthetic polymer used for creating large diameter blood vessels.

Vascular diseases, encompassing conditions such as atherosclerosis, aneurysms, and peripheral 
vascular disease, represent significant global health problems, affecting millions annually. Current 
therapeutic approaches, including lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and surgical 
procedures like bypass grafting and endovascular stenting, offer benefits but are constrained by limitations 
such as donor scarcity, inadequacy of allogeneic grafts, and the risk of immunologic rejection, especially 
with large animalderived vessels(1). Despite the utilization of synthetic polymers like poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET, Dacron) for creating large diameter (6 mm) blood vessels, achieving vessel patency 
in smaller diameter (6 mm) applications remains a formidable challenge due to thrombosis(2). Another 
challenge is a small vessel disease (SVD) affecting coronary arteries with a diameter 2.5 mm(3),(4).
