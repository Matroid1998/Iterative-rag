Description:
Produced industrially from nitrogen through the Haber-Bosch process at high temperature and pressure.

Text:
Nitrogen (N2) is an abundant diatomic molecule that makes up 
78 of the Earths atmosphere. It is therefore highly desirable 
to include this typically inert molecule in the syntheses of value
added products or to use it as reservoirs of chemical energy.1 
Industrially, atmospheric nitrogen enters the synthetic cycle 
through the wellestablished HaberBosch process, in which N2 
is hydrogenated to ammonia at high temperature (500C) and 
pressure (200 atm).2 The extreme reaction conditions required 
for such an important economical process have significant 
energy consequences, consuming approximately 1  of the 
worlds energy supply, mostly in the form of pollutionintensive 
coal.2c Indeed, the thermodynamic stability of N2 molecule 
makes its use dependent on surmounting significant energy 
barriers and requires an activation step to cleave NN bond.
