Description:
Requires purification as an intermediate in a multistep process.

Text:
Using this method, various 
coupling reactions with nucleophiles can be achieved, in
cluding deacylative borylation of aromatic ketones, Suzuki
Miyaura arylation, and MizorokiHeck alkenylation.3236 
However, this method requires the purification of the oxime 
ester intermediate, making the process multistep. Recently, 
the Takaya group reported a borylation reaction via
