Metaldoped amorphous silicates have been
used extensively in industrial applications. For
example, the Phillips catalyst, CrOxSiO2, is
used to produce more than one third of the
worlds polyethylene;1,2 WOxSiO2 has long
been used in the Phillips Triolefin Process
for the largescale production of ethylene and
2butene from the metathesis of propene.35
The advantage of these heterogeneous catalysts
stems from a simple production procedure of
the material with dispersed metal centers, and
the high activity of distorted catalytic sites em
bedded in the amorphous silicate matrix. De
spite largescale applications, the active sites
and reaction mechanisms are not well under
stood due to the inherent heterogeneity in both
composition and structure.
