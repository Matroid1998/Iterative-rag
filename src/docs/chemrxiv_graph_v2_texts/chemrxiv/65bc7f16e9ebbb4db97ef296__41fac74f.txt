Description:
Exist as single tautomers due to resonance stabilization energy.

Text:
Depending on the particular dye structure, 
the pH (as in aminoazo dyes4,5) or addition of metal ions (as in macrocycle containing azo 
dyes68) can also affect the tautomeric state. Among them the resonance stabilization energy 
plays the decisive role going from A to H, this the reason why the azophenols exist as single 
Atautomers as a rule.4,9
