Description:
Undergoes reduction at the cathode in solid oxide fuel cells.

Text:
Among all types of fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer numerous advantages 
such as high energy density, high efficiency (beyond 60 and up to 90  with the addition of 
heat recovery cycles), no cyclical variations of voltage (voltage disturbances) or electrical 
fluctuation, and no environmental noise as compared to conventional power generation systems 
6,7. In the SOFCs, the electronic current is generated by oxidation of the fuel gas at the anode 
and oxygen reduction at the cathode. Therefore, the electrical current is made possible by the flow 
of the ions, down the chemical potential gradient of the mobile species, from the anode to the 
cathode through an ionic conductor membrane and electrons transport in an external circuit.
