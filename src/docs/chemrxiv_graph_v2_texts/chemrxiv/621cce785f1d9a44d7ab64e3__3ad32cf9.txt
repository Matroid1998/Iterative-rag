Description:
A full cubic unit cell with 24 cations distributed across 16 octahedral and 8 tetrahedral sites in a fully inverse spinel structure.

A
fully inverse spinel structure has onehalf of occupied octahedral
sites lled with A2 cations while the other half is lled with B3
cations and all occupied tetrahedral sites are lled with B3. It is
of note that due to the two different species across the octahedral
sites in the inverse spinel structure, that there are many possi
ble cation congurations for a fully inverse spinel whereas there
is only a single normal conguration. The inversion in spinels
results in a very large number of possible congurations. For a full cubic unit cell with formula A8B16O32, 24 cations are
distributed across 16 octahedral and 8 tetrahedral sites. Using
combinatorics there are total of
24! 8!16! 735,471 possible cationic
congurations.
