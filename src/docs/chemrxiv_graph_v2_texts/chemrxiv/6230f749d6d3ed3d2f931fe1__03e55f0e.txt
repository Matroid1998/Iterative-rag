Description:
Can be produced cost-competitively using renewable electricity-based hydrogen coupled with the traditional Haber-Bosch process.

In this work, we carry out a holistic technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of the 
costoptimal design and operation of a fully electrochemical ammonia generation process that 
relies on intermittent renewable energy sources, setting out to identify key productivity metrics 
that are necessary for economic viability. Specifically, we find that a fully electrochemical reactor 
capable of synthesizing ammonia at partial currents exceeding 400 mA cm2 and energy 
efficiencies exceeding 30 can operate costcompetitively, i.e. at costs of 1 kg NH3, with 
processes using renewable electricitybasedhydrogen coupled with the traditional HaberBosch 
process.
