Description:
A component of CO2-rich seawater involved in the carbonatization of oceanic crust.

Text:
The Archean oceanic crust has recorded extensive 
carbonatization under CO2rich seawater (11, 12). Considering theoretical and laboratory simulations 
suggesting comparably, or even further, CO2enriched surface environments on the Hadean Earth 
(1315), widespread occurrence of CO2 vents and pools is a likely feature of the Hadean Ocean floor 
(8). Our group recently hypothesized that such generation and transportation of CO2 fluids were a 
crucial circumstance for the chemical evolution of life (8). Although it has long been suggested that 
life originated in deepsea hydrothermal vent environments (1618), the apparently waterfilled 
condition has posed many significant challenges regarding experimental verification of prebiotic 
organic synthesis (19).

Description:
Present as a supercritical fluid under warm and moderately pressurized conditions, exhibiting a versatile solvent function.

Text:
Beyond warm and moderately pressurized conditions (31.1 C and 73.8 
bar), CO2 is present as a supercritical fluid, exhibiting a versatile solvent function owing to its 
intermediate property between liquid and gas. The unique characteristics, coupled with the ease of 
preparation, has led to the use of supercritical CO2 (hereafter referred to scCO2) in a variety of 
chemical and industrial processes that are difficult to be operated in a simple aqueous solution (20). Thus, liquid and scCO2 formed through subseafloor hydrothermal processes likely diversified 
prebiotic chemistry and resultant materials available for the origin of life (8). Here, we demonstrate methanethiol synthesis under a simulated scCO2 condition in primordial 
subseafloor.
