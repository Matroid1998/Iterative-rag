Description:
Often used as dopants in host materials for quantum information storage applications, but can introduce local strain and site inhomogeneity.

Text:
Materials containing rareearth cations are
promising quantum information storage (QIS)
candidates. Their 4f4f optical transitions are
wellshielded by filled 5s and 5p orbitals, and
they have long nuclear spin and optical coher
ence times.14 Often for QIS applications with
Eu3containing compounds, low Eu3 con
centrations are introduced as dopants in host
materials.59 But this introduces local strain,
increasing Eu3 site inhomogeneity. This inho
mogeneity broadens transition linewidths and
prevents the resolution of hyperfine transi
