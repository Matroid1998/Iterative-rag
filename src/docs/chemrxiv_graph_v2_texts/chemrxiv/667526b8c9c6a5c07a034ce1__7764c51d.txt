Description:
Forms complexes with transition metals that are intermediates in dehydrocoupling and polymerization.

Text:
For example, addition of silanes to transition metals has the potential to lead to the formation 
of silane complexes which are key intermediates in dehydrocoupling and polymerization of 
silanes,13 along with hydrosilylation of unsaturated carboncarbon and carbonheteroatom bonds.4 
Similarly, borane complexes, derived from addition of boranes to transition metals, are widespread 
and underpin catalytic hydroboration and CH borylation methodologies.58 

In the past few years, the complex concept has expanded to include the coordination of molecular 
zinc hydride complexes to other transition metal centers (TM) creating new heterometallic TMHZn 
motifs.911 These species have recently been invoked as intermediates in the catalytic CH zincation 
of aromatic and heteroaromatic substrates.12 Despite notable advances in this area, all the reported 
complexes described to date are welldefined closedshell species based on 16 or 18electron count 
at the transition metal.
