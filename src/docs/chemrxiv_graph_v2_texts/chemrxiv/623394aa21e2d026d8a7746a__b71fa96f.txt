Description:
Catalyzes alkene hydrogenations.

Text:
The area of manganese catalyzed alkene hydrogenations is 
developing,12 but contemporary mechanistic understanding is 
in contrast to the radical mechanisms of earlier stoichiometric 
alkene hydrogenation with Mn(CO)5H13 and catalytic ke
tonealkynealkene hydrosilylation.14,15,16 Newer studies often 
propose unusual nonradical paths without consideration of the 
former mechanistic studies and robust empirical support. Significant work remains to uncover the nature of Mn
catalyzed hydrogenation reaction mechanisms, and dinuclear 
catalysts have not been explored in detail.
