Description:
A compound that can undergo isomerization.

Text:
Through the deposition of catalytically active metal sites via atomic layer 
deposition in MOFs (AIM),912 or surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC),13 the porous MOF 
NU100014 has proven to be an effective support for catalytic sites capable of ethylene 
hydrogenation10,15 and oligomerization,1618 propane oxidative dehydrogenation,19 alkene 
epoxidation20 and propyne isomerization.9 
However, the design of novel MOF catalysts is quite challenging deposited active sites in 
MOFs are by their nature quite difficult to characterize,21 and the active site and catalytic activity
