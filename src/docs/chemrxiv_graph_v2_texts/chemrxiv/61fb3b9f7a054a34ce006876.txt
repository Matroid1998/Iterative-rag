Involved in combustion mechanisms.

24 implemented an NNbased 
model to reveal the mechanisms of methane 
combustion. In addition to developing PES models, many other 
methods have been developed to accelerate AIMD 
calculations. The nanoreactor is a recently introduced 
AIMDaccelerating simulation method 25. The rate 
of reactions can be highly accelerated with a virtual 
piston periodically pushing molecules toward the 
center of the simulation. Several new pathways for 
glycine synthesis from primitive compounds proposed 
to exist on early Earth have been successfully revealed 
26. Nanoreactors would provide new insights into 
complicated 
chemical 
processes 
and 
discover 
elementary steps suitable for complex systems such as 
soot. Here, we develop an NNbased model to explore the 
soot formation mechanism with ab initio accuracy.
