Description:
Subject of pulsed EPR measurements to quantify spin density at 13C atoms of the Cp rings.

Text:
However, this is rarely the case in 
continuous wave (CW) EPR because of the 
intrinsically broad linewidths. This can in principle be 
addressed by pulsed EPR hyperfine methods.14 
However, there are surprisingly few pulsed EPR 
studies on molecular Ln complexes,15 with the notable 
exception of those of the 8S72 Gd3 ion, and even fewer 
for An complexes.1618 Most Ln3 pulsed EPR studies 
have been performed on doped minerals or glasses, 
and have tended to focus on relaxation behaviour.19 In 
2011 Denning and coworkers reported pulsed EPR 
measurements on Yb(Cp)3, enabling quantification 
of the significant spin density at the 13C atoms of the 
Cp rings,20 which was discussed in terms of mixing of 
the 2F72 ground term with lowlying chargetransfer 
states.

Description:
A late lanthanide complex.

Text:
The latter are chosen because they are all Kramers 
ions and hence are expected to be EPRactive; (ii) 
comparison with the late Ln3 complex Yb(Cp)3;20 
(iii) comparision of 1Ln with the early An3 
homologues 1An.16 The latter includes direct 
comparison of the valence isoelectronic Nd3 (4f3) and 
U3 (5f3) pair, which is the only comparison available 
between 4f and 5f M3 ions that does not require 
designated radiochemical laboratories (although Ce3 
and Th3 have the same number of valence electrons,
