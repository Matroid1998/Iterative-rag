Description:
Candidate molecules for redox flow battery electrolytes and electrochemical CO2 capture.

Text:
Quinone and hydroquinonebased molecules have gathered attention as candidate molecules
for a variety of purposes  redox ow battery electrolytes,19 electrochemical CO2 capture,10
uorescence and colorimetric sensors,11,12 and pharmaceutical products,13 among other ap
plications.14 Recently, eutectic mixtures of small organic molecules have also gained attention
as candidate materials for ow battery electrolytes.1518 In order to identify promising ma
terials for eutectic electrolytes, determining the melting temperatures of the quinone and
hydroquinone molecules is essential.19 With an eective approximation of the regular solu
tion model,20,21 the melting points of the singlecomponent quinones and hydroquinones can
be used to predict the melting point of a eutectic mixture.

Description:
An organic molecule for which melting point prediction is desirable.

Text:
However, melting data is not
readily available for all the quinones and hydroquinones of interest, so having a model that
predicts the melting points of quinone and hydroquinone molecules is highly desirable.22
Various approaches are employed to predict organic compound melting points.2325 Many
models employ group contribution methods (GCMs).26,27 These are additive methods that
sum the contributions from all of the functional groups within a molecule. However, these
methods do not account for intermolecular interactions between functional groups on dier
ent molecules.28 Treating molecules as isolated species neglects eects such as Van der Waals
(VdW) and hydrogen bonding, which are key contributors to macroscopic properties such
as melting point. Karthikeyan et al.29 recognized this in their machinelearning (ML) based
approach to predicting melting points of organic chemicals.
