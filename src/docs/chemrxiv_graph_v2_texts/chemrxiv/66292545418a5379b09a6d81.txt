Description:
A canonical residue used in peptide macrocyclisation.

Text:
While numerous synthetic 
methods have been developed to enable effective peptide 
macrocyclisation, biocompatible chemistries that work with 
readily accessible building blocks in environmentally acceptable 
solvents are still required to enable the significant impact of 
macrocyclic peptides as a nextgeneration drug discovery tool 
to be realised. Many of the synthetic methods developed to cyclise 
peptides58 take inspiration from nature and utilise the 
canonical residues, cysteine (Cys) and lysine (Lys), or the native 
N and Cterminal functionality to form disulfide,5 thioether,9, 10 
and amide bonds.
