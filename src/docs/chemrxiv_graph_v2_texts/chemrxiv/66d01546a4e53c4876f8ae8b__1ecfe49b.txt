To mitigate the effects of climate change, a transition to renewable and clean energy sources is crucial 
to sustainably meet the escalating global demand for energy.1 Harnessing solar energy to drive 
photoelectrochemical (PEC) reactions is promising for the sustainable production of energy carriers and 
chemical fuels, including hydrogen by water splitting.25 PEC water splitting efficiency remains low 
due predominantly to severe bulk charge recombination and the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER) at the photoanode surface.6 An approach to overcome the constraints is to employ ferroelectric
based photoanodes.
