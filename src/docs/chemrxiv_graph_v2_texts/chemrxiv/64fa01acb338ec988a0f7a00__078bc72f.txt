Description:
Used in lighting applications.

Another
important class of materials is also introduced due to their advanced properties such as magnetic (Neodymium),
lighting (Lanthanum), Catalytic at high temperature (CeriumLanthanum), component of a exceptional sort of
glass (Praseodymium), visual displays in devices (Yttrium, terbium, europium), and (Gadolinium) is used in
MRI, and Xray scanning method, and as well as television screens. In addition, as shown here, this class of
elements named as rareearth materials might possess advanced features which would be exploitable for future
catalysistechnological composite materials engineering. Therefore, in this review article one focus is dedicated
to the novel development and application of hybrid materials made of rareearth in union with other materials. 2.

Description:
Improves nickel dispersion and the ratio of metallic to acid functions among rare earth elements.

Text:
Analysis results displays that the
Lanthanum (La) modified catalysts reaches the highest ammonia conversion. To boost the catalytic performance
of this (La)modified NiAl2O3 catalyst a pretreatment step was required. Hence, 400 C and 600 C as
calcination, and reduction temperature respectively shows the highest NH3 conversion as high as 94 at 550 C.
Moreover, it is notified from Lis work 24 that lanthanum (La) is the best choice for improving the nickel
dispersion and the ratio of metallic to acid functions among rare earth elements. Indeed, due to this fact, high
