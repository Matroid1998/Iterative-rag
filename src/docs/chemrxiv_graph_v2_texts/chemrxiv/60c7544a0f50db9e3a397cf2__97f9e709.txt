Description:
Complexes containing aryl isocyanide groups and zerovalent Cr, Mo, and W, known for their strong photoreductant properties.

Text:
Although known since the 1970s, complexes 
M(CNR)6 containing aryl isocyanide groups and zerovalent Cr, Mo and especially W have 
recently gained some attention due to their attractive properties as very strong photoreductants and 
their low cost compared to ruthenium or iridium compounds.4 In presence of an oxidant and an 
excess of isocyanide RNC, complexes M(CNR)72 can be prepared. For example, 
Mo(CNMe)72 was prepared by the oxidation of Mo(CO)6 with elemental iodine in presence of 
an excess methyl isocyanide.5 These compounds represent rare examples of homoleptic seven
coordinate complexes. The number of structurally characterized group 6 metal complexes with seven isocyanide ligands 
is very limited. The crystal structures of Mo(CNtBu)7PF62,6 W(CNtBu)7W6O19,7
