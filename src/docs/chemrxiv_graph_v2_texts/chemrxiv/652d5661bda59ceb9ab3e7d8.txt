Description:
An inorganic molecule that is captured and transformed by autotrophic organisms during photosynthesis.

Text:
Every carbon atom in materials or living organisms that surrounds us was part of a CO2 molecule 
in the past, and has been captured by some autotrophic organism during the second step of 
photosynthesis (CalvinBenson cycle1). This complicated process transforms carbon from an 
inorganic state (CO2) to an organic state by forming a CC bond, and is thus directly or indirectly 
the prime source of growth of all living organisms. Three different mechanisms of carboncapture 
are used during photosynthesis C3, C4 and CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). 97 of plant 
varieties belongs to the C3 family and simultaneously captures and integrates the atmospheric CO2 
in the organism via the enzyme Rubisco2.
