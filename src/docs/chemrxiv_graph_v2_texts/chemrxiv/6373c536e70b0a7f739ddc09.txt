Description:
A compound mentioned in the context of transition metal oxides.

Text:
Hundreds of million tons of chemicals are produced yearly in the world via ox
idation reactions. These recent years, considerable eorts have been devoted
to improve the fundamental understanding of transition metal oxides (TMO)
based heterogeneous oxidation catalysis in the liquid phase to a level that is
comparable to metal catalysis in the gas phase. While for the later largescale
industrial oxidation processes are wellestablished, the former has the poten
tial for new processes and breakthroughs that will allow high selectivity, total
conversion, low energy separation and rawmaterial recycling. TMO have cap
tured interest due to their abundance and low cost compared to metals. Co3O4
