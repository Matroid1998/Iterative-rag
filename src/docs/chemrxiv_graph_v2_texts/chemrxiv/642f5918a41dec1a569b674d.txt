Description:
Used in lithium-ion batteries, which involve complex electrochemical reactions.

Text:
There has been recent interest in applying highthroughput experimentation and
machine learning to discover electrochemical reactions and predict reaction outcomes,6,7 yet
the identification of electrochemical reaction pathways and products remains challenging.8
Electrochemical reaction mechanisms likewise cannot be easily analyzed by experiment,9 in
part because they are frequently driven by shortlived radical and ionic intermediates.10
Electrolyte degradation in metalion batteries is an example of a technologically impor
tant and highly complex electrochemical reaction cascade. In lithiumion batteries (LIBs),
