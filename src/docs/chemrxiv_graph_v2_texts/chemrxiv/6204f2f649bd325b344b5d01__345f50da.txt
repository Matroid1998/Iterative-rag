Description:
Compounds that can be trapped by suitable electrophiles.

Text:
Hu and others developed 
elegant approaches on trapping ammonium ylides by suita
ble electrophiles (Scheme 1a, right).2527 In spite of their high 
efficiency, the development of a facile and mechanistic dis
tinct synthetic route to access these valuable compounds is 
still in high demand. To our knowledge, palladiumcata
lyzed threecomponent amination and alkylation of car
benic carbon center, which could lead to fully substituted 
amino acid derivatives, is hitherto unknown. Scheme 1. Hypothesis on Accessing ,Disubstituted 
Amino Acid Derivatives through PalladiumCatalyzed 
Aminoallylation. In line with our research interests in diazo chemistry28
39,4050, we wonder whether a cascade reaction on amination 
and allylic alkylation of a transient palladium carbene5160 
intermediate could take place. If such a threecomponent
reaction is feasible, compounds embedded with ,
