Description:
An element with a large size and low electronegativity, capable of multiple valence states and excellent electron-transfer ability.

Sulphur atoms are found in a wide variety of natural products, drugs, organic materials,
agrochemicals, and small molecules of medicinal interest13. The large size (1.02 ) and low
electronegativity (2.4) of the sulphur atom make the outer electron shell more prone to accept and

donate electrons, resulting in its multiplicity of valence (Figure 1A)4. Almost every atom (except inert
elements) can bond with sulphur atoms, and its valence state can vary from 2 to 65. The excellent
electrontransfer ability and radical properties of sulphurcontaining backbones make them ideal
candidates
for
catalysis6,
particularly
in
the
photoredox
pathway7. To
date,
numerous
sulphurcontaining photosensitizers have been synthesized and employed in visiblelightinduced
transformations, such as disodium benzophenondisulphonate (BPSS)8, thiazine dyes9, thiophene
derivatives10 and Nphenylphenothiazine (PTH)11.
