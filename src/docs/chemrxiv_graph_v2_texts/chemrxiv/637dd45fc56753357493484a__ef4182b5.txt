Description:
The corresponding reagent for electrophilic fluorinations.

Text:
Iodine(III) reagents are widely used in organic and inorganic chemistry as oxidants for a 
variety of applications.13 A common motif is ArIX2, where X can be a halide, an acetoxy 
group, cyano group or a neutral pyridyl ligand amongst others. The most widely used species 
from this family are PhI(OAc)2, which is commercially available, and PhICl2, which is not 
commercially available due to its instability to prolonged storage, but is easy to generate and 
store at low temperatures. PhICl2 is used as a replacement for Cl2 in chlorination applications, 
with the advantage of increased safety and ease with which an equivalent of Cl2 may be 
delivered stoichiometrically. PhIF2 is the corresponding reagent for electrophilic 
fluorinations.
