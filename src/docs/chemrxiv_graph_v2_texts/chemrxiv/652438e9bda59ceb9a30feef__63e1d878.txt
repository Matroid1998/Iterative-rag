Fey has demonstrated and popularized the utility of ligand 
descriptors and properties to evaluate possible catalytic activity.1321 
One major chemical descriptor that has been used for several decades to compare the donor 
capacity of phosphines is the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP). The TEP is a very sensitive measure of 
a ligands electron donating or electron withdrawing capacity with only minor influence from steric and 
dispersion type effects.2224 Typically, a Tolman electronic parameter is measured by the A1 symmetric 
carbonyl stretching frequency for an LNi0(CO)3 complex, where L is the ligand of interest. Figure 1 
displays a 3dimensional representation of (CH3)3PNi0(CO)3 with a depiction of the A1 symmetric carbonyl 
stretch.
