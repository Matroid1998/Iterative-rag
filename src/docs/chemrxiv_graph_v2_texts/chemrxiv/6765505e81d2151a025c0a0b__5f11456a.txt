Description:
A molecule whose deliverable capacity in molecular crystals can be predicted using geometric descriptors such as accessible surface area and pore diameters.

Hence, many of the inherently local graphbased deep architectures fail to capture
globaldriven properties, while traditional ML models that use handcrafted descriptors have proved more
successful in capturing spatial information in some cases 14, 15. Handcrafted descriptors such as smooth
overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) 16 and atomcentered symmetry functions (ACSFs) 17 have proven
effective in predicting properties like lattice energy 12, while geometric descriptors such as accessible
surface area and pore diameters have been used to predict the methane deliverable capacity of molecular
crystals 18 as well as other globaldriven properties of porous materials 19. More recently, persistent
homology 20, 21 has been shown to successfully encode global molecular geometric features into machine
learned representations 22.
