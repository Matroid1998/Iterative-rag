Description:
Widely used structures in medicinal chemistry due to their involvement in enzyme catabolism and signal transduction.

Text:
Purines are among the most widely used structures in medicinal chemistry. This is due to the large
number of enzymes that use purine cofactors, known as purineutilising enzymes (PUEs), which
are involved in the catabolism of purines and pyrimidines1. Additionally, purinergic receptors play a
key role in signal transduction following their activation by extracellular purines. Therefore, purines are considered privileged structures in medicinal chemistry, with more than 15
FDAapproved purine drugs. For example, Vidaza, 5fluorouracil, tecadenoson, and regrelor, to
name a few2. Therefore, medicinal chemists have developed several synthetic routes to obtain
structurally diverse purine libraries. The use of polysubstituted pyrimidines as core elements prior
to the purine ring formation is one of the most widely used approaches.
