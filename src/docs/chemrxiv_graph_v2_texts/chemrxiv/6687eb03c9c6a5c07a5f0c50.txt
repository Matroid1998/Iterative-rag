Description:
An ion beam used in the BioTRIFT system for imaging.

Text:
As a result, image ho
mogeneity is improved, and a dynamictime mode of imaging is enabled. Additionally, we investigate the limits of topographical differences of the 
FMM instrument as these are relevant for reliable imaging of largearea 
samples. Materials and Methods 
Instrumentation 
The BioTRIFT system used includes a C60 ion beam (IOGC6020S, Ion
optika, Chandlers Ford, UK) and a Timepix3 ASICbased camera 
(TPX3CAM, Amsterdam Scientific Instruments, Amsterdam, NL) and 
is described in detail elsewhere.21 Two linear encoders (LS 477, Hei
denhain, Traunreut, DE) connected to a digitization card (NI6612, Na
tional Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) were added to the BioTRIFT 
stage directly under the existing encoders, allowing both normal instru
ment operation (Figure S1).
