It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nThe most important TMD is MoS2, which\nhas attracted great interest as a lowcost and environmentally\nfriendly electrocatalyst for HER mechanism1113. Furthermore,\nMoS2 catalysts are already produced on large scales for hydro\ntreatment and hydrocracking reactions for oil rening. In general, the activity of the catalyst depends mainly on the to\ntal number of active sites and on their intrinsic activity. For pris\ntine MoS2, both theoretical calculations and subsequent experi\nmental results have shown that promising sites are generally con\nned to the small region of exposed edges14.

It constitutes about 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.

Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets.

The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

Furan is used as a starting point to other specialty chemicals. Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen. The class of compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans. Furan is aromatic because one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a 4n+2 aromatic system (see Huckel's rule) similar to benzene. Because of the aromaticity, the molecule is flat and lacks discrete double bonds. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the flat ring system. The sp2 hybridization is to allow one of the lone pairs of oxygen to reside in a p orbital and thus allow it to interact within the pi-system. The Feist-Benary synthesis is a classic way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed. One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of 1,4-diketones with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in the Paal-Knorr Synthesis. The thiophene formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with Lawesson's reagent also forms furans as side products. 2,4-Disubstituted furans can be synthesized by sulfone-mediated cyclization of 1,3-diketones\\nProperties:safety: Flammable and Irritant and Health Hazard\\nsmiles: C1=COC=C1\\nformula: C4H4O\\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 68.07 g/mol\\nXLogP3: 1.3\\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 1\\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\\nExact Mass: 68.026214747 Da\\nMonoisotopic Mass: 68.026214747 Da\\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 13.1\\nHeavy Atom Count: 5\\nFormal Charge: 0\\nComplexity: 22.8\\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \\n\\n\"]\nwikipedia: ['Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen atom.

Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place.

Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element.

It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal. The free metal burns with a brilliant-white light. The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine.

While effective ligand design is essential for optimizing oxidative addition, reductive elimination, and active \ncatalyst formation and stability, base selection influences nucleophile binding, deprotonation, and overall catalyst performance. Traditional methods often rely on inorganic bases or strong anionic bases with low nucleophilicity. pubchem: [\"Name: Copper\\nText:\\nCopper is a metal that occurs naturally throughout the environment, in rocks, soil, water, and air. Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets. Copper compounds are commonly used in agriculture to treat plant diseases like mildew, for water treatment and, as preservatives for wood, leather, and fabrics.\\nReddish lustrous malleable odorless metallic solid.\\nCopper atom is a copper group element atom and a metal allergen. It has a role as a micronutrient and an Escherichia coli metabolite.\\nCopper is a transition metal and a trace element in the body. It is important to the function of many enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, monoamine oxidase and superoxide dismutase. Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD).\\nCopper is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nCopper is an essential trace element that is included in some over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, even though copper deficiency is quite rare and supplementation is rarely needed. The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

It has the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral sodium borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.\\nBoron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovas and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, so it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust. It constitutes about 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust. It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.\\nElemental boron is found in small amounts in meteoroids, but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth.\\nSeveral allotropes exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (9.3 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature (1.5\\u2009×\\u200910−6\\u2009Ω−1\\u2009cm−1 room temperature electrical conductivity). The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.\\nBoron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all production consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and heat-resistant materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. As sodium perborate, it is used as a bleach.

Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"high-test peroxide\", decomposes explosively when heated and has been used as both a monopropellant and an oxidizer in rocketry.\\nHydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and the simplest peroxide, a compound having an oxygen–oxygen single bond. It decomposes slowly into water and elemental oxygen when exposed to light, and rapidly in the presence of organic or reactive compounds. It is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution in an opaque bottle. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body.

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Phthalocyanine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "TEMPO", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TEMPO", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "DMPO", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TEMPO", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Phosphorus", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen peroxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']\nAmong \nthe various sectors, laundry is classified as the sector that demands the highest volumes \nof water that generates a proportional amount of complex effluents with high toxicity and \nrecalcitrance.7,22,3640 \nDue to the diversity of chemicals added to the washing processes, hospital laundry \neffluents may contain soap,29,41 detergents,4144 surfactants,41,45,46 sodium hypochlorite,47,48 \nhydrogen peroxide,7,49,50 peracetic acid,4951 softeners,52,53 neutralizing additives,54 \nchlorine,43,44,48 adsorbable organic halogens (AOX),44,55 nitrogen, phosphorus,7,37,56 and \nheavy metals5760 that give these residues the power to exercise less biodegradable \ncharacteristics to the effluent generated by the hospital units.9 \nHowever, tissues from different areas such as the operating room, intensive care \nunit, hospitalization, hemodialysis, imaging, emergency room, among others, are sources \nof dirt such as blood, pus, medication residues, secretions and excretions,6164 which can \ncontain pathogenic bacteria,49,51,71,54,61,6570 fungi or viruses.56,7274 Besides, a high \nconcentration of particulate material, organic matter, proteins, starch, oils and greases40,75 \ncan be found. pubchem: [\"Name: Sodium Hypochlorite\\nText:\\nSodium hypochlorite appears as colorless or slightly yellow watery liquid with an odor of household bleach.

In 2010, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\".

Higher level of oxygen than ambient air (hyperoxia) can be introduced under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions.\\nOxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nOxygen has been reported in Euonymus hamiltonianus, Acacia kempeana, and Abelmoschus esculentus with data available.\\nOxygen is an element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight 16.\\nOXYGEN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2006 and has 82 investigational indications.\\noxygen is a mineral.\\noxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nAn element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nOver 170 sequences \nhave been annotated as PHD fingers in the human genome.3 They contain conserved regions of \ncysteine and histidine residues that coordinate two Zn2 ions in a cross braced fashion, with an \nantiparallel twostranded sheet core, which imposes conformational stability.37 These domains \nread a range of histone marks, notably the methylation state of the K4 residue of H3 histone \n(H3K4Me3, H3K4Me2 or H3K4Me0), and the H3K9 and H3R2 positions.8,9 Mutations within this \nmotif have been linked to immunological, neurological and developmental disorders.10,11 \n\n5 pubchem: ['Name: Histidine\\nText:\\nL-histidine is the L-enantiomer of the amino acid histidine.

Histidine is also required for blood cell manufacture and protects tissues against damage caused by radiation and heavy metals. (NCI04)\\nHISTIDINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II (across all indications) and has 3 investigational indications.\\nHistidine is an alpha-amino acid with an imidazole functional group. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids. Histidine was first isolated by German physician Albrecht Kossel in 1896. Histidine is an essential amino acid in humans and other mammals. It was initially thought that it was only essential for infants, but longer-term studies established that it is also essential for adults. Infants four to six months old require 33 mg/kg of histidine. It is not clear how adults make small amounts of histidine, and dietary sources probably account for most of the histidine in the body. Histidine is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Inborn errors of histidine metabolism exist and are marked by increased histidine levels in the blood. Elevated blood histidine is accompanied by a wide range of symptoms, from mental and physical retardation to poor intellectual functioning, emotional instability, tremor, ataxia and psychosis. Histidine and other imidazole compounds have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-secretory properties  The efficacy of L-histidine in protecting inflamed tissue is attributed to the capacity of the imidazole ring to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by cells during acute inflammatory response  Histidine, when administered in therapeutic quantities is able to inhibit cytokines and growth factors involved in cell and tissue damage (US patent 6150392). Histidine in medical therapies has its most promising trials in rheumatoid arthritis where up to 4.5 g daily have been used effectively in severely affected patients. Arthritis patients have been found to have low serum histidine levels, apparently because of very rapid removal of histidine from their blood  Other patients besides arthritis patients that have been found to be low in serum histidine are those with chronic renal failure. Urinary levels of histidine are reduced in pediatric patients with pneumonia.  Asthma patients exhibit increased serum levels of histidine over normal controls   Serum histidine levels are lower and are negatively associated with inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women   Histidine supplementation has been shown to reduce insulin resistance, reduce BMI and fat mass and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with metabolic syndrome.  Histidine appears to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly via the NF-kappaB pathway, in adipocytes  Low plasma concentrations of histidine are associated with protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, and greater mortality in chronic kidney disease patients  Histidine may have many other possible functions because it is the precursor of the ubiquitous neurohormone-neurotransmitter histamine. Histidine increases histamine in the blood and probably in the brain. Low blood histamine with low serum histidine occurs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Low blood histamine also occurs in some manic, schizophrenic, high copper and hyperactive groups of psychiatric patients. Histidine is a useful therapy in all patients with low histamine levels.\\nAn essential amino acid that is required for the production of HISTAMINE.\\nSee also: Histidine Monohydrochloride (has salt form); Histidine Monohydrochloride Monohydrate (is active moiety of); Fenugreek seed (part of) ...

It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the light noble gases. It is highly toxic.\\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.\\nOwing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.\\nFluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants and marine sponges synthesize organofluorine poisons (most often monofluoroacetates) that help deter predation.\"]\nCalcium looping (CaL) has emerged as a possible nextgeneration CCUS technology \nthat can provide better technoeconomic performance than conventional solvent \nscrubbing technologies 8.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Increased drug stability and selectivity", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "adamantane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "adamantane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "conformational rigidity", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Adamantane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Conformational restriction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Naphthalene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fluorinated Bicyclic Compounds", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "fluorinated bicyclic scaffold", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Adamantane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Bioavailability", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Drug-likeness", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Increased metabolic stability", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Nickel can combine with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, and oxygen to form nickel compounds. Many nickel compounds dissolve fairly easy in water and have a green color. Nickel compounds are used for nickel plating, to color ceramics, to make some batteries, and as substances known as catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\"]\nWith growing concerns about global warming being a major\nchallenge of our time, alternatives to fossil fuel are sought\nacross many branches of science.

It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits, and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.\\nBecause of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.\\nSilicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs in its pure form in the Earth's crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.\\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional silicate-based soda–lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.\\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (<15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.\\nSilicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.\"]\nPolycrystalline SiC has been an interest of research for decades due to its high hardness, \ncorrosion resistance and phase stability at elevated temperatures. Cubic silicon carbide, also \nknown as 3CSiC or SiC, is often utilized as a hard protective coating because it can be \ndeposited as a coating via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at moderate temperatures around \n1000 . The precursors employed in the SiC CVD can be classified into two categories. Multicomponent precursors, e.g. methyltrichlorosilane (MTS)15 and hexamethyldisilane \n(HMDS)610 can function as the source for both Si and C atoms. The alternative are CVD \nprocesses with separate silicon and carbon precursors, e.g., silane (SiH4) and silicon \ntetrachloride (SiCl4) are widely used Siprecursors, whereas short chain hydrocarbons, e.g. methane1115, propane14,1618, ethylene19,20 and acetylene2123, have been \nutilized as Cprecursors. pubchem: ['Name: Hexamethyldisilane\\nText:\\nProperties:safety: Flammable and Irritant and Health Hazard\\nsmiles: C[Si](C)(C)[Si](C)(C)C\\nformula: C6H18Si2\\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 146.38 g/mol\\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 0\\nRotatable Bond Count: 1\\nExact Mass: 146.09470364 Da\\nMonoisotopic Mass: 146.09470364 Da\\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 0\\nHeavy Atom Count: 8\\nFormal Charge: 0\\nComplexity: 61.5\\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \\n\\n']\nwikipedia: ['Hexamethyldisilane (TMS2) is the organosilicon compound with the formula Si2(CH3)6, abbreviated  Si2Me6.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon anode", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silicon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is used as a chemical weapon agent and is characterized as a colorless gas with a strong rotten egg odor that causes irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, as well as toxic systemic effects.\\nHydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas. Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant. The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur.

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere. CO2, or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\nNearly all CO2 produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.:\\u200a3\"]\nGlobal climate changes represent a serious threat to humans.

It is estimated that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will \nbe increased to 950 ppm by 2100 (the present value of 400 ppm; httpswww.ipcc.ch).

As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']\nThe incorporation of phosphorus into heterocyclic \nsystems can lead to significant changes in their \nproperties \nand \nreactivity.

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "The specific nitrogen flow rate conditions varied during the carbon nitride deposition process were not provided in the given information.", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "N2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "N2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Not specified", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "nitrogen flow rate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen flow rate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "dinitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen flow rate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "N₂", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "50-200 sccm", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "0-50 sccm", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "nitrogen flow rate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, somewhat brittle, gray metal.\\nCobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since antiquity for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass. The color was long thought to be due to the metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue pigment-producing minerals. They were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave off poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), which was ultimately named for the kobold.\\nToday, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The Copperbelt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes (114,000 long tons; 128,000 short tons) (according to Natural Resources Canada), and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50%.\\nCobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays. Cobalt is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst when refining crude oil. This is to purge it of sulfur, which is very polluting when burned and causes acid rain.\\nCobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin B12, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, algae, and fungi.\\nThe name cobalt derives from a type of ore considered a nuisance by 16th century German silver miners, which in turn may have been named from a spirit or goblin held superstitiously responsible for it; this spirit is considered equitable to the kobold (a household spirit) by some, or, categorized as a gnome (mine spirit) by others.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt compounds", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt amidinate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt amidinate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Amidinates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt(II) amidinates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt amidinates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt(III) acetylacetonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt acetylacetonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt amidinates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt amides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Co(II) amidinates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Coumarins, as a class, are comprised of numerous naturally occurring benzo-alpha-pyrone compounds with important and diverse physiological activities. The parent compound, coumarin, occurs naturally in many plants, natural spices, and foods such as tonka bean, cassia (bastard cinnamon or Chinese cinnamon), cinnamon, melilot (sweet clover), green tea, peppermint, celery, bilberry, lavender, honey (derived both from sweet clover and lavender), and carrots, as well as in beer, tobacco, wine, and other foodstuffs. Coumarin concentrations in these plants, spices, and foods range from <1 mg/kg in celery, 7000 mg/kg in cinnamon, and up to 87,000 mg/kg in cassia. An estimate of human exposure to coumarin from the diet has been calculated to be 0.02 mg/kg/day. Coumarin is used as an additive in perfumes and fragranced consumer products at concentrations ranging from <0.5% to 6.4% in fine fragrances to <0.01% in detergents. An estimate for systemic exposure of humans from the use of fragranced cosmetic products is 0.04 mg/kg BW/day, assuming complete dermal penetration. The use of coumarin as a food additive was banned by the FDA in 1954 based on reports of hepatotoxicity in rats. Due to its potential hepatotoxic effects in humans, the European Commission restricted coumarin from naturals as a direct food additive to 2 mg/kg food/day, with exceptions granting higher levels for alcoholic beverages, caramel, chewing gum, and certain 'traditional foods'. In addition to human exposure to coumarin from dietary sources and consumer products, coumarin is also used clinically as an antineoplastic and for the treatment of lymphedema and venous insufficiency. Exposure ranges from 11 mg/day for consumption of natural food ingredients to 7 g/day following clinical administration. Although adverse effects in humans following coumarin exposure are rare, and only associated with clinical doses, recent evidence indicates coumarin causes liver tumors in rats and mice and Clara cell toxicity and lung tumors in mice. The multiple effects as well as the ongoing human exposure to coumarin have resulted in a significant research effort focused on understanding the mechanism of coumarin induced toxicity/carcinogenicity and its human relevance. These investigations have revealed significant species differences in coumarin metabolism and toxicity such that the mechanism of coumarin induced effects in rodents, and the relevance of these findings for the safety assessment of coumarin exposure in humans are now better understood. In October 2004, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2004) reviewed coumarin to establish a tolerable daily intake (TDI) in foods. EFSA issued an opinion indicating that coumarin is not genotoxic, and that a threshold approach to safety assessment was most appropriate. EFSA recommended a TDI of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg BW/day. Including dietary contributions, the total human exposure is estimated to be 0.06 mg/kg/day. As a pharmaceutical, coumarin has been used in diverse applications with a wide variety of dosing regimens. Unlike coumadin and other coumarin derivatives, coumarin has no anti-coagulant activity. However, at low doses (typically 7 to 10 mg/day), coumarin has been used as a 'venotonic' to promote vein health and small venule blood flow. Additionally, coumarin has been used clinically in the treatment of high-protein lymphedema of various etiologies.

It is a volatile red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured vapour. Its properties are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from Ancient Greek  βρῶμος (bromos) 'stench', referring to its sharp and pungent smell.\\nElemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur as a free element in nature. Instead, it can be isolated from colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts analogous to table salt, a property it shares with the other halogens. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine evaporation ponds, mostly in the United States and Israel. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.\\nAt standard conditions for temperature and pressure it is a liquid; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is mercury. At high temperatures, organobromine compounds readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops free radical chemical chain reactions. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as fire retardants, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet sunlight to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the atmosphere to yield free bromine atoms, causing ozone depletion. As a result, many organobromine compounds—such as the pesticide methyl bromide—are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in well drilling fluids, in photographic film, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of organic chemicals.\\nLarge amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ions, causing bromism. However, bromine is beneficial for human eosinophils, and is an essential trace element for collagen development in all animals. Hundreds of known organobromine compounds are generated by terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and some serve important biological roles. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs.

License CC BYNC 4.0 wikipedia: [\"The actinide () or actinoid () series encompasses at least the 14 metallic chemical elements in the 5f series, with atomic numbers from 89 to 102, actinium through nobelium. Number 103, lawrencium, is also generally included despite being part of the 6d transition series. The actinide series derives its name from the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide.\\nThe 1985 IUPAC Red Book recommends that actinoid be used rather than actinide, since the suffix -ide normally indicates a negative ion. However, owing to widespread current use, actinide is still allowed.\\nActinium through nobelium are f-block elements, while lawrencium is a d-block element and a transition metal. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although as isolated atoms in the ground state many have anomalous configurations involving the filling of the 6d shell due to interelectronic repulsion. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from curium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium, plutonium, and americium occupying an intermediate position.\\nAll actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. These have been used in nuclear reactors, and uranium and plutonium are critical elements of nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.\\nOf the actinides, primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities. The radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium, and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores. The other actinides are purely synthetic elements. Nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment; analysis of debris from a 1952 hydrogen bomb explosion showed the presence of americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium and fermium.\\nIn presentations of the periodic table, the f-block elements are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the 4f and 5f series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).\"]\nThe smaller size and tailorable magnetic property make SMMs useful for high density\nstorage devices.1,2 As the spin state of an SMM could be manipulable, molecular spintronics\ndevices can use SMMs.3 SMMs can be incorporated into molecular switches, green magnetic\ncooling systems, sensors and in quantum computing.47 The first SMM was discovered for\na transition metal complex consists of Mn12.8 Recently SMMs are mostly generated from\nlanthanides and actinides.911 However, very recently, the affair of LISCO in combinational\nwith SMM of transition metal complexes is drawing attention of the researcher because of\nits various potential applications.12\n2\nhttpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv202364hfs ORCID httpsorcid.org000000031523630X Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.

It is found in air, soil, and water, and is present in all foods. Pure zinc is a bluish-white shiny metal. Zinc has many commercial uses as coatings to prevent rust, in dry cell batteries, and mixed with other metals to make alloys like brass, and bronze. A zinc and copper alloy is used to make pennies in the United States. Zinc combines with other elements to form zinc compounds. Common zinc compounds found at hazardous waste sites include zinc chloride, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc sulfide. Zinc compounds are widely used in industry to make paint, rubber, dyes, wood preservatives, and ointments.\\nZinc ashes appears as a grayish colored powder.

Zinc deficiency is associated with anemia, short stature, hypogonadism, impaired wound healing, and geophagia. It is identified by the symbol Zn.  A newer study suggests implies that an imbalance of zinc is associated with the neuronal damage associated with traumatic brain injury, stroke, and seizures.   Understanding the mechanisms that control brain zinc homeostasis is, therefore, imperative to the development of preventive and treatment regimens for these and other neurological disorders.  In addition to the above, recent review articles have already demonstrated the important role of zinc in the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders, plus discussed the potential value of zinc as a marker of these diseases.  Most recently, research has shown that polymorphism of the common polymorphism in zinc transporter SLC30A8/ZnT8 may increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes provided novel insights into the role of zinc in diabetes.\\nZinc is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nZinc is an essential mineral and heavy metal that is included in most over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, and is used therapeutically in higher doses because of its ability to block copper absorption as maintenance therapy of Wilson disease.

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. \\nCorrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.']\nOxide materials, such as those containing zinc 7,8, tin 2,9,10, and titanium \n11,12, have been widely investigated due to their good sensing properties, such as \nsensitivity, and fast response in the detection of toxic and flammable gases 13.

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Water", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It occurs in the essential oils of numerous plant species e.g. magnolia. It has a role as a volatile oil component, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a carcinogenic agent, a mouse metabolite and an apoptosis inhibitor. It is an ortho-fused bicyclic arene and a member of naphthalenes.\\nNaphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride; it is also used in mothballs. Acute (short- term) exposure of humans to naphthalene by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact is associated with hemolytic anemia, damage to the liver, and neurological damage. Cataracts have also been reported in workers acutely exposed to naphthalene by inhalation and ingestion. Chronic (long-term) exposure of workers and rodents to naphthalene has been reported to cause cataracts and damage to the retina. Hemolytic anemia has been reported in infants born to mothers who \"sniffed\" and ingested naphthalene (as mothballs) during pregnancy. Available data are inadequate to establish a causal relationship between exposure to naphthalene and cancer in humans.

It has a distinct, pungent odor that can be detected at levels as low as 0.08 ppm.  Naphthalene is the most abundant single component of coal tar so most of it is now industrially derived from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a minor component of naphthalene production. Naphthalene is also produced naturally with trace amounts of naphthalene being produced by black walnuts, magnolias and specific types of deer, as well as the Formosan subterranean termite. Some strains of the endophytic fungus (Muscodor albus) also produce naphthalene. Naphthalene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are released from incomplete combustion processes originating in industry, cigarette smoke and motor vehicle exhaust, as well as natural events such as forest fires. Industrially, naphthalene is used in the production of phthalic anhydride, as a solvent for chemical reactions, as a wetting agent and as a fumigant.  It is also used in pyrotechnic special effects such as the generation of black smoke and simulated explosions. In the past, naphthalene was administered orally to kill parasitic worms in livestock. Naphthalene was once the primary ingredient in mothballs, though its use has largely been replaced in favor of alternatives such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. In a sealed container containing naphthalene pellets, naphthalene vapors build up to levels that are toxic to both the adult and larval forms of many moths. Naphthalene has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and catabolic functions (4, 5). Exposure to large amounts of naphthalene may damage or destroy red blood cells. Humans, in particular children, have developed this condition, known as hemolytic anemia, after ingesting mothballs or deodorant blocks containing naphthalene.\\nnaphthalene is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nSee also: (1,2,3,4-~13~C_4_)Naphthalene (annotation moved to) ...

Sodium fluoride dissolves easily in water, but calcium fluoride does not. Fluorine also combines with hydrogen to make hydrogen fluoride, a colorless gas. Hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine and hydrogen fluoride are used to make certain chemical compounds. Hydrofluoric acid is used for etching glass. Other fluoride compounds are used in making steel, chemicals, ceramics, lubricants, dyes, plastics, and pesticides. Fluorides are often added to drinking water supplies and to a variety of dental products, including toothpaste and mouth rinses, to prevent dental cavities. UPDATE: In 2015, thePHS replacedthe 1962 Drinking Water Standards from 0.7\"\"1.2 mg/L to an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L.

It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the light noble gases. It is highly toxic.\\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.\\nOwing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.\\nFluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single. Alkanes have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane (CH4), where n = 1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like pentacontane (C50H102) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an isomer of tetradecane (C14H30).\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines alkanes as \"acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2, and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms\". However, some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the cycloalkanes) or polycyclic, despite them having a distinct general formula (e.g. cycloalkanes are CnH2n).\\nIn an alkane, each carbon atom is sp3-hybridized with 4 sigma bonds (either C–C or C–H), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C–H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane.\\nOne group of the higher alkanes are waxes, solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP), for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.\\nWith their repeated –CH2 units, the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of 14.03 u (the total mass of each such methylene-bridge unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01 u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01 u each).\\nMethane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long-chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi. Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much biological activity.  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive functional groups of biological molecules.\\nThe alkanes have two main commercial sources: petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas.\\nAn alkyl group is an alkane-based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding.

It is the reverse of hydrogenation.  Dehydrogenation is important, both as a useful reaction and a serious problem.  At its simplest, it is a useful way of converting alkanes, which are relatively inert and thus low-valued, to olefins, which are reactive and thus more valuable. Alkenes are precursors to aldehydes (R−CH=O), alcohols (R−OH), polymers, and aromatics.  As a problematic reaction, the fouling and inactivation of many catalysts arises via coking, which is the dehydrogenative polymerization of organic substrates.\\nEnzymes that catalyze dehydrogenation are called dehydrogenases.\\nIn metal manufacturing and repairs, dehydrogenation is a thermal treatment which consists in removing the hydrogen absorbed by an object during an electrochemical or chemical process, performed in a specific oven at a temperature of 180–200 °C (360–390 °F) for a minimum time of 2 hours.']\nOur results indicated that hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide \n(CO), and formic acid (HCOOH) were the products \ngenerated during the CO2RR (Figure 4d and Figure S11).

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.

It can also result from bacterial breakdown of organic matter. It is also produced by human and animal wastes. Bacteria found in your mouth and gastrointestinal tract produce hydrogen sulfide from bacteria decomposing materials that contain vegetable or animal proteins. Hydrogen sulfide can also result from industrial activities, such as food processing, coke ovens, kraft paper mills, tanneries, and petroleum refineries. Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable, colorless gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs. It is commonly known as hydrosulfuric acid, sewer gas, and stink damp. People can smell it at low levels.\\nHydrogen sulfide appears as a colorless gas having a strong odor of rotten eggs. Boiling point -60.2 °C.

It is used as a chemical weapon agent and is characterized as a colorless gas with a strong rotten egg odor that causes irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, as well as toxic systemic effects.\\nHydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas. Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant. The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as electron donor in photosynthesis, thereby producing elemental sulfur. (In fact, this mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria, algae and plants which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen).\\nA flammable, poisonous gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs.

It is a tautomer of a L-tyrosine zwitterion.\\nTyrosine is a non-essential amino acid. In animals it is synthesized from [phenylalanine]. It is also the precursor of [epinephrine], thyroid hormones, and melanin.\\nL-Tyrosine is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nTyrosine has been reported in Pinus densiflora, Cyperus aromaticus, and other organisms with data available.\\nL-Tyrosine is the levorotatory isomer of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. L-tyrosine is a naturally occurring tyrosine and is synthesized in vivo from L-phenylalanine. It is considered a non-essential amino acid; however, in patients with phenylketonuria who lack phenylalanine hydroxylase and cannot convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, it is considered an essential nutrient. In vivo, tyrosine plays a role in protein synthesis and serves as a precursor for the synthesis of catecholamines, thyroxine, and melanin.\\nTYROSINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and is indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and has 2 investigational indications.\\nTyrosine is an essential amino acid that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Once in the brain, it is a precursor for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, better known as adrenalin. These neurotransmitters are an important part of the body's sympathetic nervous system, and their concentrations in the body and brain are directly dependent upon dietary tyrosine. Tyrosine is not found in large concentrations throughout the body, probably because it is rapidly metabolized. Folic acid, copper and vitamin C are cofactor nutrients of these reactions. Tyrosine is also the precursor for hormones, thyroid, catecholestrogens and the major human pigment, melanin. Tyrosine is an important amino acid in many proteins, peptides and even enkephalins, the body's natural pain reliever. Valine and other branched amino acids, and possibly tryptophan and phenylalanine may reduce tyrosine absorption. A number of genetic errors of tyrosine metabolism occur. Most common is the increased amount of tyrosine in the blood of premature infants, which is marked by decreased motor activity, lethargy and poor feeding. Infection and intellectual deficits may occur. Vitamin C supplements reverse the disease. Some adults also develop elevated tyrosine in their blood. This indicates a need for more vitamin C. More tyrosine is needed under stress, and tyrosine supplements prevent the stress-induced depletion of norepinephrine and can cure biochemical depression. However, tyrosine may not be good for psychosis. Many antipsychotic medications apparently function by inhibiting tyrosine metabolism. L-dopa, which is directly used in Parkinson's, is made from tyrosine. Tyrosine, the nutrient, can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of Parkinson's. Peripheral metabolism of tyrosine necessitates large doses of tyrosine, however, compared to L-dopa. \\nA non-essential amino acid. In animals it is synthesized from PHENYLALANINE.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.\"]\nModern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to \nthis area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical \npathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild \nconditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of \nacyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and \n(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, \nalkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky \nreagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful \nstrategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet \nhighly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a \npractical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with \nunique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess \namounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically \nused to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel \ncatalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale \napplications. wikipedia: ['The haloalkanes (also known as halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are alkanes containing one or more halogen substituents. They are a subset of the general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes that contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula \"RX\" where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).\\nHaloalkanes have been known for centuries. Chloroethane was produced in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century in step with the development of organic chemistry and the understanding of the structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.\\nWhile many haloalkanes are human-produced, substantial amounts are biogenic.']\nModern organonickel chemistry has significantly contributed to \nthis area with the emergence of new and highly efficient radical \npathways to forge C(acyl)C(sp3) bonds under very mild \nconditions.3 Nickelcatalyzed reductive coupling reactions of \nacyltransfer reagents (typically acyl halides, anhydrides, and \n(thio)esters) with C(sp3) electrophiles including alkyl halides, \nalkyl carboxylic acidderived redox active esters, and Katritzky \nreagents, have been recently highlighted as very powerful \nstrategies to achieve this goal.4 By coupling two reactive, yet \nhighly accessible and benchstable electrophiles, they provide a \npractical and versatile access to a variety of dialkyl ketones with \nunique functional group tolerance.5 However, the excess \namounts of heterogeneous metal reductants that are typically \nused to generate a reactive alkyl radical and sustain the nickel \ncatalytic redox cycle inevitably thwarts potential largescale \napplications.", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Halogenated organic electrophiles and acyl-transfer reagents", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acyl chlorides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acyl chlorides and alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel(II) bromide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkyl halide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkyl halides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Organohalides and acyl chlorides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "organohalides and acyl-transfer reagents", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It has a role as a human metabolite and a cofactor. It is an alkali metal cation, an elemental potassium, a monovalent inorganic cation and a monoatomic monocation.\\nPotassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell generate an action potential—a \"spike\" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. Potassium is also an essential mineral needed to regulate water balance, blood pressure and levels of acidity.\\nPotassium cation is a Potassium Salt and Osmotic Laxative. The mechanism of action of potassium cation is as an Osmotic Activity. The physiologic effect of potassium cation is by means of Increased Large Intestinal Motility and Inhibition Large Intestine Fluid/Electrolyte Absorption.\\nPotassium ion has been reported in Artemia salina, Galactites tomentosus, and other organisms with data available.\\nPotassium is an essential electrolyte. Potassium balance is crucial for regulating the excitability of nerves and muscles and so critical for regulating contractility of cardiac muscle. Although the most important changes seen in the presence of deranged potassium are cardiac, smooth muscle is also affected with increasing muscle weakness, a feature of both hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. Potassium (K+) is a positively charged electrolyte, cation, which is present throughout the body in both intracellular and extracellular fluids. The majority of body potassium, >90%, are intracellular. It moves freely from intracellular fluid (ICF) to extracellular fluid (ECF) and vice versa when adenosine triphosphate increases the permeability of the cell membrane. It is mainly replaced inside or outside the cells by another cation, sodium (Na+). The movement of potassium into or out of the cells is linked to certain body hormones and also to certain physiological states. Standard laboratory tests measure ECF potassium. Potassium enters the body rapidly during food ingestion. Insulin is produced when a meal is eaten; this causes the temporary movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. Over the ensuing hours, the kidneys excrete the ingested potassium and homeostasis is returned. In the critically ill patient, suffering from hyperkalaemia, this mechanism can be manipulated beneficially by administering high concentration (50%) intravenous glucose. Insulin can be added to the glucose, but glucose alone will stimulate insulin production and cause movement of potassium from ECF to ICF. The stimulation of alpha receptors causes increased movement of potassium from ICF to ECF. A noradrenaline infusion can elevate serum potassium levels. An adrenaline infusion, or elevated adrenaline levels, can lower serum potassium levels. Metabolic acidosis causes a rise in extracellular potassium levels. In this situation, excess of hydrogen ions (H+) are exchanged for intracellular potassium ions, probably as a result of the cellular response to a falling blood pH. Metabolic alkalosis causes the opposite effect, with potassium moving into the cells.

It is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge (which combines with anions to form salts). In nature, potassium occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks.\\nPotassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first ionization energy, which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. It was first suggested in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts, which was demonstrated in 1807 when elemental potassium was first isolated via electrolysis. Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which 40K is radioactive. Traces of 40K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.\\nPotassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from outside to inside cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.\\nMost industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility of its compounds in water, such as saltwater soap. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.']\nIn recent years, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) have garnered considerable attention amid other twodimensional\n(2D) materials due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical\nproperties 16.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates.

It is noncombustible, but will actively support the burning of combustible materials. Some materials that will not burn in air will burn in oxygen. Materials that burn in air will burn more vigorously in oxygen. As a non-liquid gas it is shipped at pressures of 2000 psig or above. Pure oxygen is nonflammable.

It is a conjugate base of a hydridodioxygen(1+).\\nOxygen is an element displayed by the symbol O, and atomic number 8.  It is an essential element for human survival. Decreased oxygen levels may be treated with medical oxygen therapy. Treatment with oxygen serves to increase blood oxygen levels and also exerts a secondary effect of decreasing blood flow resistance in the diseased lung, leading to decreased cardiovascular workload in an attempt to oxygenate the lungs. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. Higher level of oxygen than ambient air (hyperoxia) can be introduced under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions.\\nOxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nOxygen has been reported in Euonymus hamiltonianus, Acacia kempeana, and Abelmoschus esculentus with data available.\\nOxygen is an element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight 16.\\nOXYGEN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2006 and has 82 investigational indications.\\noxygen is a mineral.\\noxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nAn element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nThere \nare, nevertheless, a few exceptions like the RuII(2,6bis(phenylazo)pyridine)3(PF62 15 showing four \naccessible valence states, Cr(L3)3 with six accessible valence states 16 or polyoxometalates (POMs)  \nmultinuclear early transition metal systems such as Li6P2W18O62 17 or NBu44S2W18O62 18,19 (NBu4  \ntetrabutylammonium cation), which can accommodate multiple electrons in a series of multiple \nreversible reduction reactions (Figure 1A and 1B).

Nickel can combine with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, and oxygen to form nickel compounds. Many nickel compounds dissolve fairly easy in water and have a green color. Nickel compounds are used for nickel plating, to color ceramics, to make some batteries, and as substances known as catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Pi bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "C=C", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C=C", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "carbon-carbon double bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C=C", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Double bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C=C bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "π-bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "carbon-carbon double bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C-H bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "π bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "double bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans.

LLZO has a high ionic conductivity and thermal and chemical stability against reactions with prospective electrode materials, mainly lithium metal, giving it an advantage for use as an electrolyte in solid-state batteries. LLZO exhibits favorable characteristics, including the accessibility of starting materials, cost-effectiveness, and straightforward preparation and densification processes. These attributes position this zirconium-containing lithium garnet as a promising solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.\\nMoreover, LLZO demonstrates a notable total conductivity, surpassing most other solid lithium-ion conductors and many lithium garnets. The fact that the total and bulk conductivities are of the same order of magnitude distinguishes LLZO garnet-type oxide as particularly attractive when compared to other ceramic lithium-ion conductors. This suggests that LLZO, with its garnet-like structure, holds significant promise for enhancing the performance of solid-state lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.\\n\\nSince oxygen, zirconium, and lanthanum in LLZO are rigidly bound in the framework of the garnet-like structure, their mobility will be negligible at operating temperatures and, hence, the ionic motion is due to the transport of Li+ ions.\\nThe enhanced lithium ion conductivity and reduced activation energy observed in LLZO, compared to other lithium-containing garnets, can be attributed to several factors. These include an expansion in the cubic lattice constant, an increase in lithium ion concentration, reduced chemical interactions between Li+ ions and other lattice ions, and improved densification. Even when compared to the conductivity of the relatively unstable polycrystalline Li3N at lower temperatures, LLZO demonstrates comparable performance. However, at elevated temperatures, LLZO outperforms Li3N, exhibiting a higher total conductivity.\\nLLZO  has two stable phases: the tetragonal phase and the cubic (Cubic crystal system) phase. Although the tetragonal phase can be obtained at lower synthesis temperatures than the cubic phase, the latter has higher conductivity than the former. Both phases possess the same structural framework but there is a difference in the distribution of Li atoms, which dominantly determines the ionic conductivity of LLZO,  Li ions have more available sites for migration in the cubic phase than in the tetragonal phase. Moreover, the cubic phase LLZO is very stable in air while the tetragonal phase suffers from a phase transition occurring at around 100 – 150 °C in air.\\nPress reports have stated that LLZO is believed to be the electrolyte used by QuantumScape for their solid-state lithium metal battery.\\nJapanese company Niterra is working on next-generation Lithium ion battery with LLZO as electrolyte.\\nLLZO has also been used as an electrolyte material in next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries.\\n\\n\\n== References ==']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Li3N", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Li3N", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Li3N", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Li3N", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Li2NH", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nLong et al. recently reported \nCr3(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)82 (BTT3 1,3,5benzenetristetrazolate)12 MOF, which exhibits very high \nselectivity for oxygen over hydrogen and nitrogen.

Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogenolysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "H2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "H2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "HKUST-1", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "UiO-66", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Platinum(II) acetylacetonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Water", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "MOF", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "MOF-74", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Mg-MOF-74", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is always found combined with other elements such as oxygen, silicon, and fluorine. Aluminum as the metal is obtained from aluminum-containing minerals. Small amounts of aluminum can be found dissolved in water. Aluminum metal is light in weight and silvery-white in appearance. Aluminum is used for beverage cans, pots and pans, airplanes, siding and roofing, and foil. Aluminum is often mixed with small amounts of other metals to form aluminum alloys, which are stronger and harder. Aluminum compounds have many different uses, for example, as alums in water-treatment and alumina in abrasives and furnace linings. They are also found in consumer products such as antacids, astringents, buffered aspirin, food additives, and antiperspirants.\\nAluminium(0) is an elemental aluminium.\\nA metallic element that has the atomic number 13, atomic symbol Al, and atomic weight 26.98.\\nAluminum is a metallic element in the boron group with atomic symbol Al, atomic number 13, and atomic weight 27.\\nAluminium is a mineral with formula of Al.

Data indicate that aluminum contaminates much of the raw material used to manufacture solutions used for intravenous nutritional support of hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and that pharmaceutical manufacturers have only recently obtained the technology necessary to detect aluminum contamination of their products. As a result, aluminum bypassed normal barriers and entered the blood, accumulating in tissues such as bone, liver and the central nervous system with toxic consequences. Now that the FDA has finally issued a rule governing aluminum contamination in these solutions, manufacturers will need to develop methods to minimize such contamination; scientists should also realize that when data they obtain indicate a serious problem in the manufacturing sector they should be sure that the problem is properly addressed.

It has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel. Aluminium has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. It visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the 12th-most abundant element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used in radiometric dating.\\nChemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.\\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of interest, and studies are ongoing.']\nLithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is the standard lithium salt for the stateoftheart \ncommercial lithium ion batteries (LIBs).

Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds.

It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nThe NiOOH phase is \nunstable at open circuit potential, but is created when polarizing \nthe Ni(OH)2 phase, of which two polymorphs exist, where \nNi(OH)2 is a hydrated, disordered form of Ni(OH)2.17,18 \nCharging of Ni(OH)2 first leads to an oxidation of Ni2 to Ni3 and \na phase change to NiOOH.

The general science of metals is called metallurgy, a subtopic of materials science; aspects of the electronic and thermal properties are also within the scope of condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry, it is a multidisciplinary topic. In colloquial use materials such as steel alloys are referred to as metals, while others such as polymers, wood or ceramics are nonmetallic materials.\\nA metal conducts electricity at a temperature of absolute zero, which is a consequence of delocalized states at the Fermi energy. Many elements and compounds become metallic under high pressures, for example, iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.\\nWhen discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above.

In this sense the first four \"metals\" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.\\nThe strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks.

Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nLiquid organic hydrogen carrier technology is central to the transoceanic shipment of \nhydrogen1,2. Discovering costeffective catalysts that selectively dehydrogenate the \nhydrogen carriers while minimizing sidereactions is essential for the widespread \ndeployment of this technology. Currently, these catalysts are discovered using trial\nanderror methods that modify existing catalysts that were developed for other \ndehydrogenation reactions like naphtha reforming and light alkane dehydrogenation3. First principles calculations and more recently, machine learning methods have \nintroduced accelerated paradigms for catalyst discovery4,5,6,7. It is inevitable that such \ncomputational methods will be essential in discovering catalysts for dehydrogenating \nhydrogen carriers that need to meet stringent stability and selectivity requirements. wikipedia: ['In chemistry, dehydrogenation is a chemical reaction that involves the removal of hydrogen, usually from an organic molecule. It is the reverse of hydrogenation.  Dehydrogenation is important, both as a useful reaction and a serious problem.  At its simplest, it is a useful way of converting alkanes, which are relatively inert and thus low-valued, to olefins, which are reactive and thus more valuable. Alkenes are precursors to aldehydes (R−CH=O), alcohols (R−OH), polymers, and aromatics.  As a problematic reaction, the fouling and inactivation of many catalysts arises via coking, which is the dehydrogenative polymerization of organic substrates.\\nEnzymes that catalyze dehydrogenation are called dehydrogenases.\\nIn metal manufacturing and repairs, dehydrogenation is a thermal treatment which consists in removing the hydrogen absorbed by an object during an electrochemical or chemical process, performed in a specific oven at a temperature of 180–200 °C (360–390 °F) for a minimum time of 2 hours.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron(III) protoporphyrin IX", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalamin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalamin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrogenase", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt phthalocyanine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium porphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets.

A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy.

Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD).\\nCopper is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nCopper is an essential trace element that is included in some over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, even though copper deficiency is quite rare and supplementation is rarely needed. The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

It has the symbol Cu (from Latin  cuprum), and the atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.\\nCopper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form. This means that copper is a native metal. This led to very early human use in several regions, from c.\\u20098000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, c.\\u20095000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c.\\u20094000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c.\\u20093500 BC.\\nCommonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments.\\nCopper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green patina of compounds called verdigris. Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.\\nCopper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydroformylation reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Olefin Metathesis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Olefin metathesis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrocyanation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium-catalyzed Heck reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cross-coupling reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Heck reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydroformylation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydrocarbonylation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Heck reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Diels-Alder reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. Since Dmitri Ivanovsky\\'s 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898,:\\u200a4\\u200a more than 11,000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail.  The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology.\\nWhen infected, a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent viral particles, or virions, consisting of (i) genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria.\\nThe origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are still unclear. Some viruses may have evolved from plasmids, which are pieces of DNA that can move between cells. Other viruses may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack some key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\" and as replicators.\\nViruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. Many viruses spread in the air by coughing and sneezing, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles. Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range: this is narrow for viruses specialized to infect only a few species, or broad for viruses capable of infecting many.:\\u200a123–124\\u200a\\nViral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed.']\nFor example, \nthey can be engineered to mimic the mechanical properties of biological tissues, which \nmakes them ideal candidates for use in the regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues.2 \n Hydrogels are a diverse class of materials that can be engineered to have a range of \nproperties and functionalities, making them useful in a variety of biomedical and industrial \napplications.3 Here are some of the most common types of hydrogels 1) Natural \nhydrogels These hydrogels are made from naturally occurring polymers, such as hyaluronic \nacid, chitosan, or collagen.

As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

The abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, although capturing and storing it is difficult because it is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. In the Earth's atmosphere methane is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Methane is an organic compound, and among the simplest of organic compounds. Methane is also a hydrocarbon.\\nNaturally occurring methane is found both below ground and under the seafloor and is formed by both geological and biological processes. The largest reservoir of methane is under the seafloor in the form of methane clathrates. When methane reaches the surface and the atmosphere, it is known as atmospheric methane.\\nThe Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 160% since 1750, with the overwhelming percentage caused by human activity. It accounted for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases, according to the 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.

Chemically, it is an organic compound consisting of an aniline derivatized with a sulfonamide group.  Powdered sulfanilamide was used by the Allies in World War II to reduce infection rates and contributed to a dramatic reduction in mortality rates compared to previous wars.  Sulfanilamide is rarely if ever used systemically due to toxicity and because more effective sulfonamides are available for this purpose. Modern antibiotics have supplanted sulfanilamide on the battlefield; however, sulfanilamide remains in use today in the form of topical preparations, primarily for treatment of vaginal yeast infections such as vulvovaginitis caused by Candida albicans.\\nThe term \"sulfanilamides\" is also sometimes used to describe a family of molecules containing these functional groups.

Aniline is slightly soluble in water and mixes readily with most organic solvents. Aniline is used to make a wide variety of products such as polyurethane foam, agricultural chemicals, synthetic dyes, antioxidants, stabilizers for the rubber industry, herbicides, varnishes and explosives\\nAniline can cause cancer according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\\nAniline appears as a yellowish to brownish oily liquid with a musty fishy odor. Melting point -6 °C; boiling point 184 °C; flash point 158 °F. Denser than water (8.5 lb / gal) and slightly soluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Toxic by skin absorption and inhalation. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. Used to manufacture other chemicals, especially dyes, photographic chemicals, agricultural chemicals and others.\\nAniline is a primary arylamine in which an amino functional group is substituted for one of the benzene hydrogens. It is a primary arylamine and a member of anilines.\\nAniline, phenylamine or aminobenzene is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of an amine attached to a benzene ring, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Being a precursor to many industrial chemicals, its main use is in the manufacture of precursors to polyurethane. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish. Aniline is colorless, but it slowly oxidizes and resinifies in air, giving a red-brown tint to aged samples.\\nExposure to aniline may occur from breathing contaminated outdoor air, smoking tobacco, or working or being near industries where it is produced or used. The acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects of aniline in humans consist mainly of effects on the lung, such as upper respiratory tract irritation and congestion. Chronic exposure may also result in effects on the blood. Human cancer data are insufficient to conclude that aniline is a cause of bladder tumors while animal studies indicate that aniline causes tumors of the spleen. EPA has classified aniline as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.\\nAniline has been reported in Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-graecum with data available.\\nAniline is an organic chemical compound, specifically a primary aromatic amine. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. Aniline is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. Aniline was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben. In 1834, Friedrich Runge isolated from coal tar a substance which produced a beautiful blue color on treatment with chloride of lime; this he named kyanol or cyanol. In 1841, C. J. Fritzsche showed that by treating indigo with caustic potash it yielded an oil, which he named aniline, from the specific name of one of the indigo-yielding plants, Indigofera anil, anil being derived from the Sanskrit, dark-blue.\\nSee also: Aniline hydrochloride (is active moiety of) ...

It evaporates into the air very quickly and dissolves slightly in water. It is highly flammable and is formed from both natural processes and human activities. Benzene is widely used in the United States; it ranks in the top 20 chemicals for production volume. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals which are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. Benzene is also used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.\\nBenzene can cause cancer according to California Labor Code. It can cause developmental toxicity and male reproductive toxicity according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\\nBenzene appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor.

As a result, breath CH4 excretion can be used as an indicator of the in situ activity of the methanogenic flora. All CH4 produced in human beings is a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria, and about 50% of CH4 produced in the gut is absorbed and excreted in expired air. Because there appears to be no catabolism of this gas by other colonic organisms or host cells, breath CH4 measurements provide a rapid, simple means of semi quantitatively assessing the ongoing in situ metabolism of the methanogenic flora. It could seem likely that the intracolonic activity of a variety of bacteria similarly might be assessed quantitatively via analysis of expired air. However, the application of this methodology has been confounded by the rapid catabolism of many volatile bacterial products by other bacteria or human tissue. A striking aspect of the studies of breath CH4 measurements is the enormous individual variations in the excretion of this gas. Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult population do not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4. The remaining 34% of the adult population has appreciable breath methane concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm). On this basis the population can be divided into CH4 producers or nonproducers, although a more accurate term would be to define subjects as being low or high CH4 producers. The primary methanogen present in the human colon, Methanobrevibacter smithii, produces methane via a reaction that relies entirely on H2 produced by other organisms to reduce CO2 to CH4. Thus, breath CH4 concentrations might be expected to mirror breath H2 concentrations; however, the high levels of CH4 observed in the fasting state may result from H2 derived from endogenous rather than dietary substrates. A diverse assortment of conditions has been associated with a high prevalence of methane producers including diverticulosis, cystic fibrosis, high fasting serum cholesterol levels, encopresis in children, and aorto-iliac vascular disease, whereas obesity (measured as skin-fold thickness) was related inversely to methane production. The challenge that remains is to determine to what extent methanogens actively influence body physiology vs. simply serve as passive indicators of colonic function.

The abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, although capturing and storing it is difficult because it is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. In the Earth's atmosphere methane is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas.

Now that the FDA has finally issued a rule governing aluminum contamination in these solutions, manufacturers will need to develop methods to minimize such contamination; scientists should also realize that when data they obtain indicate a serious problem in the manufacturing sector they should be sure that the problem is properly addressed.

It has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel. Aluminium has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. It visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the 12th-most abundant element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used in radiometric dating.\\nChemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.\\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of interest, and studies are ongoing.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalyst Support", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acid catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Further, in a dehalogenation reaction, a carboxylate acts as a nucleophile to produce a binary compound combining a halogen atom with a less electronegative element.

The band gaps of these compounds are relatively wide due to the high \nelectronegativity of the halide anions that typically adopt the layered arrangement. Therefore, \nwhile the 2D structure has inherent benefits, its stabilisation only by lighter halides means the \nband gaps of 2D compounds are typically large. Therefore, whilst developing methods to \ncontrol the band gap and enhance optical absorption in leadfree halide materials is of general \nconcern, it is especially important for 2D A3B2X9 compounds.\nIn this work, we studied the fate of selected bromo and bromochloroalkanes in the active \nsite of two haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs), LinB and DhaA. The dehalogenation reaction \nthat these two enzymes catalyze is of prime importance from the environmental perspective as \nit leads to less toxic compounds, products of the halogen substitutions (Scheme 1). The \ndehalogenation by these two HLDs comprises two consecutive steps. The first one is a SN2 \nreaction where a carboxylate group of the enzyme acts as a nucleophile and attacks a halogen\nbearing carbon atom, yielding a halide and a reactantenzyme intermediate. This ester \nintermediate is then subsequently hydrolyzed by a neighboring water molecule, restoring the \nenzyme and yielding the product alcohol.1 \n\nScheme 1.

The alkali metals combine directly with halogens under appropriate conditions forming halides of the general formula, MX (X = F, Cl, Br or I). Many salts are halides; the hal- syllable in halide and halite reflects this correlation.\\nA halide ion is a halogen atom bearing a negative charge. The common halide anions are fluoride (F−), chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−), and iodide (I−). Such ions are present in many ionic halide salts. Halide minerals contain halides. All these halide anions are colorless.  Halides also form covalent bonds, examples being colorless TiF4, colorless TiCl4, orange TiBr4, and brown TiI4.  The heavier members TiCl4, TiBr4, TiI4 can be distilled readily because they are molecular. The outlier is TiF4, m.p. 284 °C, because it has a polymeric structure.  Fluorides often differ from the heavier halides.']\nThese \nfactors make each carboxylate unique, hampering the direct comparison in transmembrane transport \nexperiments. Furthermore, the limited number of carboxylates studied so far limits the understanding \nof the role of the organic moiety in this process. Herein, we conducted a systematic study into the role of the organic moiety in various carboxylates \nduring their internalization into liposomes.

A liposome design may employ surface ligands for attaching to desired cells or tissues.\\nBased on vesicle structure, there are seven main categories for liposomes: multilamellar large (MLV), oligolamellar (OLV), small unilamellar (SUV), medium-sized unilamellar (MUV), large unilamellar (LUV), giant unilamellar (GUV) and multivesicular vesicles (MVV). The major types of liposomes are the multilamellar vesicle (MLV, with several lamellar phase lipid bilayers), the small unilamellar liposome vesicle (SUV, with one lipid bilayer), the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV), and the cochleate vesicle. A less desirable form is multivesicular liposomes in which one vesicle contains one or more smaller vesicles.\\n\\nLiposomes should not be confused with lysosomes, or with micelles and reverse micelles.

A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, it is considered the second-densest naturally occurring metal (after osmium) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 (0.815 lb/cu in) as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant. It is one of the most corrosion-resistant metals, even at temperatures as high as 2,000 °C (3,630 °F).\\nIridium was discovered in 1803 in the acid-insoluble residues of platinum ores by the English chemist Smithson Tennant. The name iridium, derived from the Greek word iris (rainbow), refers to the various colors of its compounds. Iridium is one of the rarest elements in Earth's crust, with an estimated annual production of only 6,800 kilograms (15,000 lb) in 2023.\\nThe dominant uses of iridium are the metal itself and its alloys, as in high-performance spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process. Important compounds of iridium are chlorides and iodides in industrial catalysis. Iridium is a component of some OLEDs.\\nIridium is found in meteorites in much higher abundance than in the Earth's crust. For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary gave rise to the Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and many other species 66 million years ago, now known to be produced by the impact that formed the Chicxulub crater.

There are many forms of polymerization and different systems exist to categorize them.\\n\\nIn chemical compounds, polymerization can occur via a variety of reaction mechanisms that vary in complexity due to the functional groups present in the reactants and their inherent steric effects. In more straightforward polymerizations, alkenes form polymers through relatively simple radical reactions; in contrast, reactions involving substitution at a carbonyl group require more complex synthesis due to the way in which reactants polymerize.\\n\\nAs alkenes can polymerize in somewhat straightforward radical reactions, they form useful compounds such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are produced in high tonnages each year due to their usefulness in manufacturing processes of commercial products, such as piping, insulation and packaging. In general, polymers such as PVC are referred to as \"homopolymers\", as they consist of repeated long chains or structures of the same monomer unit, whereas polymers that consist of more than one monomer unit are referred to as copolymers (or co-polymers).\\n\\nOther monomer units, such as formaldehyde hydrates or simple aldehydes, are able to polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. −80 °C) to form trimers; molecules consisting of 3 monomer units, which can cyclize to form ring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers, or 4 monomer-unit compounds.

Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nkp can be 104105 s1 for \nheavymetal complexes,3 and only 10 s1 or less for conventional or\nganic compounds.1a Introducing heavy atoms, such as bromine, io\ndine, selenium, and tellurium, in conjunction with carbonyl func\ntionalities, is a classical approach to enhancing kp.4 Despite its long \nhistory, however, an organic kp over 100 s1 andor a p over 1 in \nsolution are rarely observed (Figure 1a, blue filled circles; Figure S1 \nand Table S1).5 The use of thiocarbonyls could provide a large kp in \nsome cases (Fiugre 1a, blue open circles).6 However, they are asso\nciated with high (photo)chemical reactivities,7 thereby limiting their \nhigh p in perfluoroalkane solvents.6b The only practical way to im\nprove p has been to suppress the nonradiative decay rate (knr). pubchem: ['Name: Tellurium\\nText:\\nGrayish-white, lustrous, brittle, crystalline solid; dark-gray to brown, amorphous powder with metallic characteristics.

It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur, all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in its native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth.\\nTellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin tellus 'earth'. Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.\\nCommercially, the primary use of tellurium is CdTe solar panels and thermoelectric devices. A more traditional application in copper (tellurium copper) and steel alloys, where tellurium improves machinability, also consumes a considerable portion of tellurium production.\\nTellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine.

(From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide nanoparticles", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO₂ nanocomposites", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium Dioxide Nanostructures", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Titanium dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TiO2 nanotubes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

However, not all carbohydrates conform to this precise stoichiometric definition (e.g., uronic acids, deoxy-sugars such as fucose), nor are all chemicals that do conform to this definition automatically classified as carbohydrates (e.g., formaldehyde and acetic acid).\\nThe term is most common in biochemistry, where it is a synonym of saccharide (from Ancient Greek  σάκχαρον (sákkharon) 'sugar'), a group that includes sugars, starch, and cellulose. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars. While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose, which was originally taken from the word glucose (from Ancient Greek  γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must'), and is used for almost all sugars (e.g., fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose (cane or beet sugar), ribose, lactose (milk sugar)).\\nCarbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve as an energy store (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g., cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods and fungi). The 5-carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes (e.g., ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.\\nCarbohydrates are central to nutrition and are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide and is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal flour, such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from sugarcane or sugar beets), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in honey, many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey is often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.\\nCellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble dietary fiber. Although it is not digestible by humans, cellulose and insoluble dietary fiber generally help maintain a healthy digestive system by facilitating bowel movements. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include resistant starch and inulin, which feed some bacteria in the microbiota of the large intestine, and are metabolized by these bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids.\"]\nCarbohydrate biomass is an abundant renewable resource which has enormous potential for the synthesis of valuable \nchemical building blocks.1 The sugars present in this material are of particular interest as a functionalised carbon \nsource to produce chiral saturated heterocycles which are of widespread potential utility in pharmaceutical \ndevelopment.2 Whilst there are many wellestablished methods for converting sugars into chiral heterocycles such \nas tetrahydrofurans (THFs) and tetrahydropyrans (THPs), these typically rely on lengthy synthetic sequences \ninvolving the extensive use of protecting groups and high costenergy reagents (e.g. wikipedia: ['Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.\\nLonger chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. Some other chemical substances, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste but are not classified as sugar.\\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Maltose may be produced by malting grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available ultra-processed food and beverages, and is sometimes used as a sweetener for foods (e.g., toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year. North and South Americans consume up to 50 kg (110 lb), and Africans consume under 20 kg (44 lb).\\nAs free sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in free sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health.

It has a role as a phytoalexin, an antioxidant, a glioma-associated oncogene inhibitor and a geroprotector. It is a stilbenol, a polyphenol and a member of resorcinols.\\nResveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin. It is a stilbenoid, a derivate of stilbene, and is produced in plants with the help of the enzyme stilbene synthase. It exists as cis-(Z) and trans-(E) isomers. The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. However, studies find that Trans-resveratrol undergoes negligible oxidation in normal atmosphere at room temperature.\\nResveratrol is a plant polyphenol found in high concentrations in red grapes that has been proposed as a treatment for hyperlipidemia and to prevent fatty liver, diabetes, atherosclerosis and aging. Resveratrol use has been associated with rare instances of serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been convincingly linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury.\\nResveratrol has been reported in Humulus lupulus, Malus, and other organisms with data available.\\nResveratrol is a phytoalexin derived from grapes and other food products with antioxidant and potential chemopreventive activities. Resveratrol induces phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (anti-initiation activity); mediates anti-inflammatory effects and inhibits cyclooxygenase and hydroperoxidase functions (anti-promotion activity); and induces promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation (anti-progression activity), thereby exhibiting activities in three major steps of carcinogenesis.

As with nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, somewhat brittle, gray metal.\\nCobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since antiquity for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass. The color was long thought to be due to the metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue pigment-producing minerals. They were so named because they were poor in known metals and gave off poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), which was ultimately named for the kobold.\\nToday, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The Copperbelt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. World production in 2016 was 116,000 tonnes (114,000 long tons; 128,000 short tons) (according to Natural Resources Canada), and the DRC alone accounted for more than 50%.\\nCobalt is primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high-energy gamma rays. Cobalt is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst when refining crude oil.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\nSadenosyl methionine methyltransferases (SAM MTases) are a ubiquitous class of \nenzymes.

Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalytic Carbon Dioxide Fixation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C-H activation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon dioxide fixation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalytic Methylation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "carbon dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitric oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "S-adenosylmethionine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methanation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon-mediated methylation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen Evolution Reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of Al2O3 (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further oxidation.']\nMechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes, catenanes and molecular knots have \nlong been considered challenging synthetic targets.1 Most synthetic routes towards MIMs rely on non\ncovalent interactions to preorganize the individual components before establishing the mechanical \nbond. However, this introduces extraneous functional groups such as ligands for metals \n(phenanthrolines, bipyridines), or electrondeficient aromatics (naphthalene diimides, viologens) which \n depending on the aim for which they are synthesized  add potentially undesired functionality to the \nfinal MIMs.1a As an alternative, covalent templates have also been used for constructing MIMs and \ntypically display higher robustness and directionality than noncovalent interactions.2 This means \nmechanical bonds can be formed under more challenging conditions, and broader scope and synthetic \nversatility is often observed with covalent templates as compared to noncovalent. wikipedia: ['A metal (from Ancient Greek  μέταλλον (métallon) \\'mine, quarry, metal\\') is a material that, when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. These properties are all associated with having electrons available at the Fermi level, as against nonmetallic materials which do not.:\\u200aChpt 8 & 19\\u200a:\\u200aChpt 7 & 8\\u200a Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets).\\nA metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride. The general science of metals is called metallurgy, a subtopic of materials science; aspects of the electronic and thermal properties are also within the scope of condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry, it is a multidisciplinary topic. In colloquial use materials such as steel alloys are referred to as metals, while others such as polymers, wood or ceramics are nonmetallic materials.\\nA metal conducts electricity at a temperature of absolute zero, which is a consequence of delocalized states at the Fermi energy. Many elements and compounds become metallic under high pressures, for example, iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure. Sodium becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure, and at even higher pressures it is expected to become a metal again.\\nWhen discussing the periodic table and some chemical properties the term metal is often used to denote those elements which in pure form and at standard conditions are metals in the sense of electrical conduction mentioned above.  The related term metallic may also be used for types of dopant atoms or alloying elements.\\nIn astronomy metal refers to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium. In this sense the first four \"metals\" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon. A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime. The metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.\\nThe strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks. Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements. There is also extensive use of multi-element metals such as titanium nitride or degenerate semiconductors in the semiconductor industry.\\nThe history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago. Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the fifth millennium BCE. Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal Oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "copper oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "copper oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chalcogenides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Noble metals", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal Oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal Oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chalcogenides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "metal oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively optical radiation.\\nIn physics, the term \"light\" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.\\nThe main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun.

Although its production is growing, PLA is still not as important as traditional commodity polymers like PET or PVC. Its widespread application has been hindered by numerous physical and processing shortcomings.

It is not among the essential amino acids. Glutamate is a key molecule in cellular metabolism. In humans, dietary proteins are broken down by digestion into amino acids, which serves as metabolic fuel or other functional roles in the body. Glutamate is the most abundant fast excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic cell. In the opposing post-synaptic cell, glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor, bind glutamate and are activated. Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, it is believed that glutamic acid is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain. Glutamate transporters are found in neuronal and glial membranes. They rapidly remove glutamate from the extracellular space. In brain injury or disease, they can work in reverse and excess glutamate can accumulate outside cells. This process causes calcium ions to enter cells via NMDA receptor channels, leading to neuronal damage and eventual cell death, and is called excitotoxicity. The mechanisms of cell death include: * Damage to mitochondria from excessively high intracellular Ca2+. * Glu/Ca2+-mediated promotion of transcription factors for pro-apoptotic genes, or downregulation of transcription factors for anti-apoptotic genes. Excitotoxicity due to glutamate occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke and diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. glutamic acid has been implicated in epileptic seizures. Microinjection of glutamic acid into neurons produces spontaneous depolarization around one second apart, and this firing pattern is similar to what is known as paroxysmal depolarizing shift in epileptic attacks. This change in the resting membrane potential at seizure foci could cause spontaneous opening of voltage activated calcium channels, leading to glutamic acid release and further depolarization.\\nA non-essential amino acid naturally occurring in the L-form.

It is a non-essential nutrient for humans, meaning that the human body can synthesize enough for its use. It is also the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABAergic neurons.\\nIts molecular formula is C5H9NO4. Glutamic acid exists in two optically isomeric forms; the dextrorotatory L-form is usually obtained by hydrolysis of gluten or from the waste waters of beet-sugar manufacture or by fermentation. Its molecular structure could be idealized as HOOC−CH(NH2)−(CH2)2−COOH, with two carboxyl groups −COOH and one amino group −NH2. However, in the solid state and mildly acidic water solutions, the molecule assumes an electrically neutral zwitterion structure −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COOH. It is encoded by the codons GAA or GAG.\\nThe acid can lose one proton from its second carboxyl group to form the conjugate base, the singly-negative anion glutamate −OOC−CH(NH+3)−(CH2)2−COO−. This form of the compound is prevalent in neutral solutions. The glutamate neurotransmitter plays the principal role in neural activation.

Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidant with powerful dehydrating properties, making it highly corrosive towards other materials, from rocks to metals. Phosphorus pentoxide is a notable exception in that it is not dehydrated by sulfuric acid but, to the contrary, dehydrates sulfuric acid to sulfur trioxide. Upon addition of sulfuric acid to water, a considerable amount of heat is released; thus, the reverse procedure of adding water to the acid is generally avoided since the heat released may boil the solution, spraying droplets of hot acid during the process. Upon contact with body tissue, sulfuric acid can cause severe acidic chemical burns and secondary thermal burns due to dehydration. Dilute sulfuric acid is substantially less hazardous without the oxidative and dehydrating properties; though, it is handled with care for its acidity.\\nMany methods for its production are known, including the contact process, the wet sulfuric acid process, and the lead chamber process. Sulfuric acid is also a key substance in the chemical industry. It is most commonly used in fertilizer manufacture but is also important in mineral processing, oil refining, wastewater treating, and chemical synthesis.

Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nMetalorganic frameworks (MOFs)1 are crystalline porous \ncoordination polymers with attractive properties, with porosity \nbeing a key feature,2 reaching up to around 7800 mg1.3 This \nintrinsic characteristic makes MOFs highly suitable for gas \nstorage and separation applications.4 The effectiveness of \nMOFs in these processes significantly depends on their \nstructural properties.

Peptide thioesters, the required starting materials for NCL, can be readily \nproduced by common FmocSPPS as masked thioester surrogates (most commonly hydrazides10\n12).\nInterestingly, it was also observed that the remaining thiol group of the diacylated product can \nfurther react with additional thioesters to generate phospholipids containing three alkyl chains.

They are the product of esterification of a carboxylic acid (R−C(=O)−O−H) with a thiol (R'−S−H). In biochemistry, the best-known thioesters are derivatives of coenzyme A, e.g., acetyl-CoA.

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere. CO2, or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\nNearly all CO2 produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.:\\u200a3\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium Carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium Carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium Carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium Carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium Carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Calcium carbonate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is abundant, multivalent and nonmetallic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with the chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature.\\nSulfur is the tenth most abundant element by mass in the universe and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called brimstone, which means \"burning stone\". Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.\\nSulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life. Many cofactors also contain sulfur, including glutathione, and iron–sulfur proteins. Disulfides, S–S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the (among others) protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning and is an elemental macronutrient for all living organisms.']\nEnergy storage devices with improved volumetric and gravimetric energy densities \nbeyond Liion batteries are essential to mitigate the effects of climate change 1. One promising candidate is the lithiumsulfur (LiS) chemistry due to its high \ntheoretical capacity (1,675 mAh g1) as well as the relative abundance, low cost and \nfavourable geographic distribution of sulfur 2,3 compared to materials used in Li\nion positive electrodes. However, while advances in this technology have been \nmade, widespread commercialisation has been hampered by a range of challenges. The insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S necessitates a greater proportion of \nconductive additives than is required for Liion batteries. These typically comprise \naround 30 wt of the positive electrode composite, which in turn reduces the \nenergy density of the cell 4,5.\nSolidstate batteries (SSBs) are at the forefront of nextgeneration energy storage technologies \nas they offer improved specific energy, energy density, and safety13. In particular, the use of \nlithium metal anodes in SSBs has attracted significant attention due to the opportunity to achieve \nspecific energies greater than 350 Wh kg1 4,5. It is believed that the use of a solidstate electrolyte \n(SSE) can mitigate the effects of dendritic deposition and inactive lithium formation that plague \nlithium metal anodes in liquid electrolytes6,7, thereby safely taking advantage of the extremely high \ntheoretical capacity (3,860 mAh g1) and low reduction potential (3.05 V vs. SHE) of lithium.

These compounds contain a distinctive functional group.  Analogues derived from oxygen replaced by other chalcogens belong to the ester category as well.  According to some authors, organyl derivatives of acidic hydrogen of other acids are esters as well (e.g. amides), but not according to the IUPAC.\\nGlycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters; naturally occurring lactones are mainly 5- and 6-membered ring lactones. Lactones contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables like celery and other foods.\\nEsters can be formed from oxoacids (e.g. esters of acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, xanthic acid), but also from acids that do not contain oxygen (e.g. esters of thiocyanic acid and trithiocarbonic acid). An example of an ester formation is the substitution reaction between a carboxylic acid (R−C(=O)−OH) and an alcohol (R'−OH), forming an ester (R−C(=O)−O−R'), where R stands for any group (typically hydrogen or organyl) and R′ stands for organyl group.\\nOrganyl esters of carboxylic acids typically have a pleasant smell; those of low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market. Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. Esters of phosphoric acid form the backbone of DNA molecules. Esters of nitric acid, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties.\\nThere are compounds in which an acidic hydrogen of acids mentioned in this article are not replaced by an organyl, but by some other group.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans.

These reagents are important in organic synthesis, and are frequently used to transfer the organic group or the lithium atom to the substrates in synthetic steps, through nucleophilic addition or simple deprotonation. Organolithium reagents are used in industry as an initiator for anionic polymerization, which leads to the production of various elastomers. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and the lithium atom, the C−Li bond is highly ionic. Owing to the polar nature of the C−Li bond, organolithium reagents are good nucleophiles and strong bases.

The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol.\\nConcentrated sulfuric acid is 98% pure and shows different properties depending upon its concentration. For instance battery acid is 30% sulfuric acid. Because the hydration reaction of sulfuric acid is highly exothermic, dilution should always be performed by adding the acid to the water rather than the water to the acid. Pure sulfuric acid is not encountered naturally on Earth in its anhydrous form, due to its great affinity for water. Dilute sulfuric acid is a constituent of acid rain, which is formed by atmospheric oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the presence of water – i.e., oxidation of sulfurous acid. Sulfur dioxide is the main byproduct produced when sulfur-containing fuels such as coal or oil are burned. Most sulfuric acid (~60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment.\\nSee also: Phenolsulfonic acid; sulfuric acid (component of); Sulfate Ion (annotation moved to) ...

It is a colorless, odorless, and viscous liquid that is miscible with water.\\n\\nPure sulfuric acid does not occur naturally due to its strong affinity to water vapor; it is hygroscopic and readily absorbs water vapor from the air. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong oxidant with powerful dehydrating properties, making it highly corrosive towards other materials, from rocks to metals. Phosphorus pentoxide is a notable exception in that it is not dehydrated by sulfuric acid but, to the contrary, dehydrates sulfuric acid to sulfur trioxide. Upon addition of sulfuric acid to water, a considerable amount of heat is released; thus, the reverse procedure of adding water to the acid is generally avoided since the heat released may boil the solution, spraying droplets of hot acid during the process. Upon contact with body tissue, sulfuric acid can cause severe acidic chemical burns and secondary thermal burns due to dehydration. Dilute sulfuric acid is substantially less hazardous without the oxidative and dehydrating properties; though, it is handled with care for its acidity.\\nMany methods for its production are known, including the contact process, the wet sulfuric acid process, and the lead chamber process.

Connolly at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington Delaware (U.S. Patent 3,282,875). Additional work on the polymer family was performed in the late 1960s by Dr. Walther Grot of DuPont. Nafion is a brand of the Chemours company. It is the first of a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties that are called ionomers. Nafion\\'s unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone.  Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent chemical and mechanical stability in the harsh conditions of this application.\\nThe chemical basis of Nafion\\'s ion-conductive properties remain a focus of extensive research. Ion conductivity of Nafion increases with the level of hydration. Exposure of Nafion to a humidified environment or liquid water increases the amount of water molecules associated with each sulfonic acid group. The hydrophilic nature of the ionic groups attract water molecules, which begin to solvate the ionic groups and dissociate the protons from the -SO3H (sulfonic acid) group. The dissociated protons \"hop\" from one acid site to another through mechanisms facilitated by the water molecules and hydrogen bonding. Upon hydration, Nafion phase-separates at nanometer length scales resulting in formation of an interconnected network of hydrophilic domains which allow movement of water and cations, but the membranes do not conduct electrons and minimally conduct anions due to permselectivity (charge-based exclusion). Nafion can be manufactured with or exchanged to alternate cation forms for different applications (e.g. lithiated for Li-ion batteries) and at different equivalent weights (EWs), alternatively considered as ion-exchange capacities (IECs), to achieve a range of cationic conductivities with trade-offs to other physicochemical properties such as water uptake and swelling.']\nInvented by Avnir in 2002,1 molecularly doped metals found \ntheir first application in catalysis in 2005 when BeharLevy and \nAvnir reported that the Nafion polymer entrapped within Ag \n(NafionAg) \nreadily \nmediates the \npinacolpinacolone \nrearrangement and the dehydration of 2phenylethanol to \nstyrene with high yield (80 and 90, respectively).2 In the \nsubsequent two decades the research field of metalorganic \nalloys (MORALs)3 continued to grow, though at a lower rate \nthan one would expect from the scope and possibilities opened \nby these new class of materials merging the properties of metals \nwith those of organic molecules.4,5 \nRanging from goldentrapped enzymes6 through palladium\nentrapped graphene oxide,7 however, MORALs are active and \nselective catalysts in a number of reactions of relevance to both \nmajor segments of the chemical industry, wherein bulk and fine \nchemicals in nearly each case are produced through catalyzed \nchemical reactions.", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Iodine is also added to some table salt to ensure that all people in the United States have enough iodine in their diet. Most radioactive iodine is manmade.

Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single. Alkanes have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane (CH4), where n = 1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like pentacontane (C50H102) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an isomer of tetradecane (C14H30).\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines alkanes as \"acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH2n+2, and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms\". However, some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the cycloalkanes) or polycyclic, despite them having a distinct general formula (e.g. cycloalkanes are CnH2n).\\nIn an alkane, each carbon atom is sp3-hybridized with 4 sigma bonds (either C–C or C–H), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C–H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone.

Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much biological activity.  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive functional groups of biological molecules.\\nThe alkanes have two main commercial sources: petroleum (crude oil) and natural gas.\\nAn alkyl group is an alkane-based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding.

Most are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter— by engine exhaust fumes, tobacco, incinerators, in roasted meats and cereals, or when biomass burns at lower temperatures as in forest fires. The simplest representative is naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene. PAHs are uncharged, non-polar and planar. Many are colorless. Many of them are also found in fossil fuel deposits such as coal and in petroleum. Exposure to PAHs can lead to different types of cancer, to fetal development complications, and to cardiovascular issues.\\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as possible starting materials for abiotic syntheses of materials required by the earliest forms of life.']\nPyrene belongs to a group of organic compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAHs), which are byproducts of incomplete combustion of organic materials and are ubiqui\ntous in the environment.

Every cell consists of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane; many cells contain organelles, each with a specific function. The term comes from the Latin word cellula meaning 'small room'. Most cells are only visible under a microscope. Cells emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago. All cells are capable of replication, protein synthesis, and motility. \\nCells are broadly categorized into two types: eukaryotic cells, which possess a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which lack a nucleus but have a nucleoid region. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be either single-celled, such as amoebae, or multicellular, such as some algae, plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotic cells contain organelles including mitochondria, which provide energy for cell functions; chloroplasts, which create sugars by photosynthesis, in plants; and ribosomes, which synthesise proteins.\\nCells were discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them after their resemblance to cells inhabited by Christian monks in a monastery. Cell theory, developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells.\"]\nA detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of SiCN deposited \nwith a temperature variation as well as of carbon nitride with nitrogen flow rate has been published \npreviously 1, 2, 3 \nA flow rate of 5 sccm was maintained for C2H2 while flow of nitrogen was varied as 5, 15, 30 and 60 sccm.

Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets. Copper compounds are commonly used in agriculture to treat plant diseases like mildew, for water treatment and, as preservatives for wood, leather, and fabrics.\\nReddish lustrous malleable odorless metallic solid.\\nCopper atom is a copper group element atom and a metal allergen. It has a role as a micronutrient and an Escherichia coli metabolite.\\nCopper is a transition metal and a trace element in the body.

Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD).\\nCopper is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nCopper is an essential trace element that is included in some over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, even though copper deficiency is quite rare and supplementation is rarely needed. The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.']\nIn recent years, interest has risen in fastcharging energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, driven \nby the current climate and energy crises16.

Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\nSince the discovery that transition metal oxides can reversibly store lithium through a \nreaction mechanism termed conversiontype reaction1, a large body of work has been \naccumulated on metal salts and their derivative compounds largely due to the possibility of \nexploiting multipleelectron transfers per redox centers that these metals can offer27.

Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide.\\nDiscovered in 1879 by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, samarium was named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thus became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, though the name was indirect.\\nSamarium occurs in concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.\\nThe main commercial use of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above 700 °C (1,292 °F), without losing their permanent magnetic properties. The radioisotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and so is added to control rods of nuclear reactors. It also forms as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other uses of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and X-ray lasers.

The double bond may be internal or at the terminal position. Terminal alkenes are also known as α-olefins.\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends using the name \"alkene\" only for acyclic hydrocarbons with just one double bond; alkadiene, alkatriene, etc., or polyene for acyclic hydrocarbons with two or more double bonds; cycloalkene, cycloalkadiene, etc. for cyclic ones; and \"olefin\" for the general class – cyclic or acyclic, with one or more double bonds.\\nAcyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups (also known as mono-enes) form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n with n being a >1 natural number (which is two hydrogens less than the corresponding alkane). When n is four or more, isomers are possible, distinguished by the position and conformation of the double bond.\\nAlkenes are generally colorless non-polar compounds, somewhat similar to alkanes but more reactive. The first few members of the series are gases or liquids at room temperature.  The simplest alkene, ethylene (C2H4) (or \"ethene\" in the IUPAC nomenclature) is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially.\\nAromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, however their structure and properties are sufficiently distinct that they are not classified as alkenes or olefins. Hydrocarbons with two overlapping double bonds (C=C=C) are called allenes—the simplest such compound is itself called allene—and those with three or more overlapping bonds (C=C=C=C, C=C=C=C=C, etc.) are called cumulenes.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Water", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "samarium(III) chloride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "samarium(III) chloride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "SmI3", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium(II) iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ketone", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium(II) iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium(II) iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "samarium(II) iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium(II) chloride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Samarium(II) iodide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nIn BaTiO3xHy two possible mechanisms for hydride ion dif\nfusion have been suggested.4,14 The rst can be described as an\noxidative diffusion, where the hydride ion transforms into a pro\nton followed by interstitial diffusion.

It is an important source of nitrogen which is needed by plants and animals. Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground.

It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant, a mouse metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver.

Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

Acute exposure can also damage the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system in humans. The liquid is corrosive and may produce dermatitis from skin contact in humans and animals. Effects to the lungs, liver, spleen, and thyroid have been reported in animals chronically (long-term) exposed to hydrazine via inhalation. Increased incidences of lung, nasal cavity, and liver tumors have been observed in rodents exposed to hydrazine. EPA has classified hydrazine as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.\\nHydrazine is a highly reactive base and reducing agent used in many industrial and medical applications.  In biological applications, hydrazine and its derivatives exhibit antidepressant properties by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that catalyzes the deamination and inactivation of certain stimulatory neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine.  In psychiatry, the use of hydrazine derivatives is limited due to the emergence of the tricyclic antidepressants.

With 2,4-pentanedione, it condenses to give the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. In the Einhorn-Brunner reaction hydrazines react with imides to give triazoles. Hydrazine is a convenient reductant because the by-products are typically nitrogen gas and water.

Connolly at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington Delaware (U.S. Patent 3,282,875). Additional work on the polymer family was performed in the late 1960s by Dr. Walther Grot of DuPont. Nafion is a brand of the Chemours company. It is the first of a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties that are called ionomers. Nafion\\'s unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone.  Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent chemical and mechanical stability in the harsh conditions of this application.\\nThe chemical basis of Nafion\\'s ion-conductive properties remain a focus of extensive research. Ion conductivity of Nafion increases with the level of hydration. Exposure of Nafion to a humidified environment or liquid water increases the amount of water molecules associated with each sulfonic acid group. The hydrophilic nature of the ionic groups attract water molecules, which begin to solvate the ionic groups and dissociate the protons from the -SO3H (sulfonic acid) group. The dissociated protons \"hop\" from one acid site to another through mechanisms facilitated by the water molecules and hydrogen bonding. Upon hydration, Nafion phase-separates at nanometer length scales resulting in formation of an interconnected network of hydrophilic domains which allow movement of water and cations, but the membranes do not conduct electrons and minimally conduct anions due to permselectivity (charge-based exclusion). Nafion can be manufactured with or exchanged to alternate cation forms for different applications (e.g. lithiated for Li-ion batteries) and at different equivalent weights (EWs), alternatively considered as ion-exchange capacities (IECs), to achieve a range of cationic conductivities with trade-offs to other physicochemical properties such as water uptake and swelling.']\nFurther disad\nvantages are formation of potentially rate limiting solid\nelectrolyte interphases, simultaneous anion diusion8,\nlower operating voltages9, and dendrite formation caus\ning incompatibility with Limetal anodes with 10\nthe capacity of current graphitic anodes10).11 The use of\na solidstate electrolyte (SSE) is therefore desirable as it\nxes many of these problems simultaneously.

In its pure form, it is a very pale blue liquid that is slightly more viscous than water. It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic, usually as a dilute solution (3%–6% by weight) in water for consumer use and in higher concentrations for industrial use. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"high-test peroxide\", decomposes explosively when heated and has been used as both a monopropellant and an oxidizer in rocketry.\\nHydrogen peroxide is a reactive oxygen species and the simplest peroxide, a compound having an oxygen–oxygen single bond. It decomposes slowly into water and elemental oxygen when exposed to light, and rapidly in the presence of organic or reactive compounds. It is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution in an opaque bottle. Hydrogen peroxide is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose hydrogen peroxide are classified as peroxidases.']\nPolymeric carbon nitrides (PCN) are sustainable, tunable, nontoxic and chemically stable \nmaterials,14 that have been utilized in the construction of various photocatalytic systems for \na wide range of lightdriven reactions, including hydrogen evolution,510 water oxidation,6, \n11, 12 CO2 reduction,13, 14 organic pollutant degradation,1517 or selective chemical \nconversions 1821.

The addition of two whole numbers results in the total amount or sum of those values combined. The example in the adjacent image shows two columns of three apples and two apples each, totaling at five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression \"3 + 2 = 5\" (that is, \"3 plus 2 is equal to 5\").\\nBesides counting items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to concrete objects, using abstractions called numbers instead, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. Addition belongs to arithmetic, a branch of mathematics. In algebra, another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects such as vectors, matrices, subspaces and subgroups.\\nAddition has several important properties. It is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter, and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter. Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting (see Successor function). Addition of 0 does not change a number. Addition also obeys rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.\\nPerforming addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks to do. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months, and even some members of other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aniline derivative compounds", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Indole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Indole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tramadol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Indole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Isoniazid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tryptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aniline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "indole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aniline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "1,2,3-Triazole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acetaminophen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Indole", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acetaminophen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

PFAS came into use with the invention of Teflon in 1938 to make fluoropolymer coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. They are now used in products including waterproof fabric such as Nylon, yoga pants, carpets, shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, heat-resistant non-stick cooking surfaces such as Teflon, firefighting foam, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used by the cosmetic industry in most cosmetics and personal care products, including lipstick, eye liner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, and nail polish.\\nMany PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA pose health and environmental concerns because they are persistent organic pollutants; they were branded as \"forever chemicals\" in an article in The Washington Post in 2018. Some have half-lives of over eight years due to a carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry. They move through soils and bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife, which are then eaten by humans. Residues are now commonly found in rain, drinking water, and wastewater. Since PFAS compounds are highly mobile, they are readily absorbed through human skin and through tear ducts, and such products on lips are often unwittingly ingested. Due to the large number of PFAS, it is challenging to study and assess the potential human health and environmental risks; more research is necessary and is ongoing.\\nExposure to PFAS, some of which have been classified as carcinogenic and/or as endocrine disruptors, has been linked to cancers such as kidney, prostate and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, suboptimal antibody response / decreased immunity, decreased fertility, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, reduced infant and fetal growth and developmental issues in children, obesity, dyslipidemia (abnormally high cholesterol), and higher rates of hormone interference.\\nThe use of PFAS has been regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants since 2009, with some jurisdictions, such as China and the European Union, planning further reductions and phase-outs. However, major producers and users such as the United States, Israel, and Malaysia have not ratified the agreement and the chemical industry has lobbied governments to reduce regulations or have moved production to countries such as Thailand, where there is less regulation.\\nThe market for PFAS was estimated to be US$28 billion in 2023 and the majority are produced by 12 companies: 3M, AGC Inc., Archroma, Arkema, BASF, Bayer, Chemours, Daikin, Honeywell, Merck Group, Shandong Dongyue Chemical, and Solvay. Sales of PFAS, which cost approximately $20 per kilogram, generate a total industry profit of $4 billion per year on 16% profit margins. Due to health concerns, several companies have ended or plan to end the sale of PFAS or products that contain them; these include W. L. Gore & Associates (the maker of Gore-Tex), H&M, Patagonia, REI, and 3M. PFAS producers have paid billions of dollars to settle litigation claims, the largest being a $10.3 billion settlement paid by 3M for water contamination in 2023. Studies have shown that companies have known of the health dangers since the 1970s – DuPont and 3M were aware that PFAS was \"highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested\". External costs, including those associated with remediation of PFAS from soil and water contamination, treatment of related diseases, and monitoring of PFAS pollution, may be as high as US$17.5 trillion annually, according to ChemSec. The Nordic Council of Ministers estimated health costs to be at least €52–84 billion in the European Economic Area. In the United States, PFAS-attributable disease costs are estimated to be $6–62 billion.\\nIn January 2025, reports stated that the cost of cleaning up toxic PFAS pollution in the UK and Europe could exceed £1.6 trillion over the next 20 years, averaging £84 billion annually.']\nAs a subgroup of solidstate nanopores, the glass \nnanopipette is modeled as a costeffective and versatile source of conical shaped \nnanopore and has been used for single DNA, protein, and nanoparticle (NP) analysis.18\n22 Compared with other solidstate nanopores, the advantages of the nanopipette are \nobvious, for it can be facilely obtained from pulling the glass or quartz capillaries with \norifice diameters ranging from micrometers to nanometers.18, 23, 24 Owing to the unique \ntip nanoarchitecture, the nanopipette is envisioned as a powerful means for integrated \nstudy and manipulation of chemical and biological sensing and electrophysiological \napplications.2527 Herein, the glass nanopipette tip structure was reconstructed through \nuptodown approach by filled the very tip of the glass nanopipette with mesoporous \ncarbon, which was subdivided and formed differential structure. pubchem: ['Name: Silicon Dioxide\\nText:\\nSilica is another name for the chemical compound composed of silicon and oxygen with the chemical formula SiO2, or silicon dioxide.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']\n21 \nM. R. Martinez, D.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F), about 500 °C (932 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys – in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −4 to +7.

It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain but affect many regions systemically. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release. Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.\\nIn popular culture and media, dopamine is often portrayed as the main chemical of pleasure, but the current opinion in pharmacology is that dopamine instead confers motivational salience; in other words, dopamine signals the perceived motivational prominence (i.e., the desirability or aversiveness) of an outcome, which in turn propels the organism's behavior toward or away from achieving that outcome.\\nOutside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local paracrine messenger. In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.\\nSeveral important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured; Levodopa, a pure form of L-DOPA, is the most widely used treatment for Parkinson's. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. Restless legs syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with decreased dopamine activity. Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection. It is useful in the treatment of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock. In newborn babies it may be used for hypotension and septic shock.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Salsolinol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Salsolinol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Neurotransmitter-derived tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "dopamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Neuromelanin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dopaminochrome", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Tetrahydroisoquinoline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']\nIn recent years, monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs) have garnered considerable attention amid other twodimensional\n(2D) materials due to their unique electronic, optical, and mechanical\nproperties 16.

Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\\nOzone's odor is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air. Ozone's O3 structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be weakly diamagnetic. At standard temperature and pressure, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures, physical shock, or fast warming to the boiling point. It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.\\nOzone is a powerful oxidizing agent (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\"]\nThe electrophilic nature of sterically hindered aryl halide has also been explored in the \nCatellani reaction by the groups of Zhou,16 Gu,10k Shi,17 and Cheng.18.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans.

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']\nThe study of pentagonal 2D structures, similar to the Cairo\npentagonal tiles, began when pentagraphene (PG), a ve\nmembered rings of carbon atoms, was theoretically charac\nterized 11.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon nanotubes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It evaporates into the air very quickly and dissolves slightly in water. It is highly flammable and is formed from both natural processes and human activities. Benzene is widely used in the United States; it ranks in the top 20 chemicals for production volume. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals which are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. Benzene is also used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.\\nBenzene can cause cancer according to California Labor Code. It can cause developmental toxicity and male reproductive toxicity according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\\nBenzene appears as a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like odor. Flash point less than 0 °F. Less dense than water and slightly soluble in water. Hence floats on water. Vapors are heavier than air.\\nBenzene is a six-carbon aromatic annulene in which each carbon atom donates one of its two 2p electrons into a delocalised pi system. A toxic, flammable liquid byproduct of coal distillation, it is used as an industrial solvent. Benzene is a carcinogen that also damages bone marrow and the central nervous system. It has a role as a non-polar solvent, a carcinogenic agent and an environmental contaminant. It is an aromatic annulene, a volatile organic compound and a member of benzenes.\\nBenzene is found in the air from emissions from burning coal and oil, gasoline service stations, and motor vehicle exhaust. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, as well as eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia, in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidence of leukemia (cancer of the tissues that form white blood cells) have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene.

The changes elicited by ligand binding (or signal sensing) in a receptor give rise to a biochemical cascade, which is a chain of biochemical events known as a signaling pathway.\\nWhen signaling pathways interact with one another they form networks, which allow cellular responses to be coordinated, often by combinatorial signaling events. At the molecular level, such responses include changes in the transcription or translation of genes, and post-translational and conformational changes in proteins, as well as changes in their location. These molecular events are the basic mechanisms controlling cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and many other processes. In multicellular organisms, signal transduction pathways regulate cell communication in a wide variety of ways.\\n\\nEach component (or node) of a signaling pathway is classified according to the role it plays with respect to the initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate primary effectors. Such effectors are typically proteins and are often linked to second messengers, which can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, noise, signal feedback and feedforward and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.']\nHowever, direct application of RPC in the analysis of human blood \nproducts is challenging in practice due to the abundance of protein and complex lipids such as \nglycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.

Many of the enzymes in the electron transport chain are embedded within the membrane.\\nThe flow of electrons through the electron transport chain is an exergonic process. The energy from the redox reactions creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In aerobic respiration, the flow of electrons terminates with molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor. In anaerobic respiration, other electron acceptors are used, such as sulfate.\\nIn an electron transport chain, the redox reactions are driven by the difference in the Gibbs free energy of reactants and products. The free energy released when a higher-energy electron donor and acceptor convert to lower-energy products, while electrons are transferred from a lower to a higher redox potential, is used by the complexes in the electron transport chain to create an electrochemical gradient of ions. It is this electrochemical gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP via coupling with oxidative phosphorylation with ATP synthase.\\nIn eukaryotic organisms, the electron transport chain, and site of oxidative phosphorylation, is found on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy released by reactions of oxygen and reduced compounds such as cytochrome c and (indirectly) NADH and FADH2 is used by the electron transport chain to pump protons into the intermembrane space, generating the electrochemical gradient over the inner mitochondrial membrane. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the electron transport chain is found on the thylakoid membrane. Here, light energy drives electron transport through a proton pump and the resulting proton gradient causes subsequent synthesis of ATP. In bacteria, the electron transport chain can vary between species but it always constitutes a set of redox reactions that are coupled to the synthesis of ATP through the generation of an electrochemical gradient and oxidative phosphorylation through ATP synthase.']\nThe increased requirements for highly performing devices raised during the last years \nconcerns regarding the supply of raw materials, especially regarding rare metals and \nsemiconductors.

License CC BY 4.0 wikipedia: ['Catalysis () is the increase in rate of a chemical reaction due to an added substance known as a catalyst (). Catalysts are not consumed by the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice; mixing, surface area, and temperature are important factors in reaction rate. Catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process of regenerating the catalyst.\\nThe rate increase occurs because the catalyst allows the reaction to occur by an alternative mechanism which may be much faster than the non-catalyzed mechanism. However the non-catalyzed mechanism does remain possible, so that the total rate (catalyzed plus non-catalyzed) can only increase in the presence of the catalyst and never decrease.\\nCatalysis may be classified as either homogeneous, whose components are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the reactant, or heterogeneous, whose components are not in the same phase. Enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical industry of all kinds. Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.\\nThe term \"catalyst\" is derived from Greek καταλύειν, kataluein, meaning \"loosen\" or \"untie\".

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nIn contrast, the twocomponent enantioselective crosscoupling of sp3hybridized electrophiles with various arylation reagents, \nwhich is catalyzed by transition metals such as nickel, cobalt, and iron, has emerged as a powerful alternative, particularly for the \nconstruction of challenging C(sp3)C(sp2) bonds. pubchem: ['Name: Nickel\\nText:\\nNickel is a very abundant natural element. Pure nickel is a hard, silvery-white metal. Nickel can be combined with other metals, such as iron, copper, chromium, and zinc, to form alloys. These alloys are used to make coins, jewelry, and items such as valves and heat exchangers. Most nickel is used to make stainless steel. Nickel can combine with other elements such as chlorine, sulfur, and oxygen to form nickel compounds. Many nickel compounds dissolve fairly easy in water and have a green color. Nickel compounds are used for nickel plating, to color ceramics, to make some batteries, and as substances known as catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions.

Respiratory effects have also been reported in humans from inhalation exposure to nickel. Human and animal studies have reported an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers from exposure to nickel refinery dusts and nickel subsulfide.

It is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal. Pure nickel is chemically reactive, but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion. Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.\\nMeteoric nickel is found in combination with iron, a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis. An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's outer and inner cores.\\nUse of nickel (as natural meteoric nickel–iron alloy) has been traced as far back as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick). Nickel minerals can be green, like copper ores, and were known as kupfernickel – Nickel's copper – because they produced no copper.\\nAlthough most nickel in the earth's crust exists as oxides, economically more important nickel ores are sulfides, especially pentlandite. Major production sites include Sulawesi, Indonesia, the Sudbury region, Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, Western Australia, and Norilsk, Russia.\\nNickel is one of four elements (the others are iron, cobalt, and gadolinium) that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion-resistant plating.\\nAbout 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 9% for plating, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, and 4% in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries, including those in electric vehicles (EVs). Nickel is widely used in coins, though nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for rechargeable batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments.

Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nAs the thiol reactivity is related to the availability of the nucleophilic\nthiolate,16,17 accurate pK a prediction tools such as the GPUaccelerated continuous con\nstant pH molecular dynamics simulations18 can be used to assess cysteine reactivities\nin drug targets.19,20 In principle, the intrinsic reactivity of a Michael acceptor can be pre\n3\nhttpsdoi.org10.26434chemrxiv2023lh0qpv2 ORCID httpsorcid.org0000000232340769 Content not peerreviewed by ChemRxiv.

Also required in the manufacture of amino acid taurine, Cysteine is a component of the antioxidant glutathione, and plays a role in the metabolism of essential biochemicals such as coenzyme A, heparin, and biotin. (NCI04)\\nCYSTEINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1986 and is indicated for liver disease and has 3 investigational indications.\\nCysteine is a uremic toxin.  Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.\\nCysteine is a naturally occurring, sulfur-containing amino acid that is found in most proteins, although only in small quantities. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible: as reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder - cystine was first isolated from kidney stones. As cysteine contains a sulphydryl group, it can undergo redox reactions. Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol, or further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly. Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine may at some point be recognized as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid. Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications. Cysteine also enhances the effect of topically applied silver, tin and zinc salts in preventing dental cavities. In the future, cysteine may play a role in the treatment of cobalt toxicity, diabetes, psychosis, cancer and seizures.\\nA thiol-containing non-essential amino acid that is oxidized to form CYSTINE.\\nSee also: Cysteine Hydrochloride (has salt form) ...

It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite, and halite (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth's minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.\\nSodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) is used in soap manufacture, and sodium chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.\\nSodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure. Animal cells actively pump sodium ions out of the cells by means of the sodium–potassium pump, an enzyme complex embedded in the cell membrane, in order to maintain a roughly ten-times higher concentration of sodium ions outside the cell than inside. In nerve cells, the sudden flow of sodium ions into the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels enables transmission of a nerve impulse in a process called the action potential.\"]\nThe latter \n49 \nusually occur during the extraction of carrageenans from red seaweed 2.

License CC BY 4.0 wikipedia: [\"Carrageenans or carrageenins ( KARR-ə-GHEE-nənz; from Irish  carraigín 'little rock') are a family of natural linear sulfated polysaccharides. They are extracted from red edible seaweeds. Carrageenans are widely used in the food industry, for their gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. Their main application is in dairy and meat products, due to their strong binding to food proteins. Carrageenans have emerged as a promising candidate in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications as they resemble animal glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). They are used for tissue engineering, wound coverage, and drug delivery.\\nCarrageenans contain 15–40% ester-sulfate content, which makes them anionic polysaccharides. They can be mainly categorized into three classes based on their sulfate content. Kappa-carrageenan has one sulfate group per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan has two, and lambda-carrageenan has three.\\nA common seaweed used for manufacturing the hydrophilic colloids to produce carrageenan is Chondrus crispus (Irish moss), which is a dark red, parsley-like alga that grows attached to rocks. Gelatinous extracts of C. crispus have been used as food additives since approximately the fifteenth century. Carrageenan is a vegetarian and vegan alternative to gelatin in some applications, and is used to replace gelatin in confectionery and other food.\\nThe first industrial commercial cultivation of Eucheuma and Kappaphycus spp. for carrageenan was developed in the Philippines. The global top producers of carrageenan are the Philippines and Indonesia. Carrageenan, along with agar, is used to produce traditional jelly desserts in the Philippines called gulaman.\\nNo clinical evidence establishes carrageenan as an unsafe food ingredient, mainly because its fate after digestion is inadequately determined.\"]\nAntimony and its alloys have been intensively studied in recent years as highcapacity anode \nmaterials in alkali metalion based rechargeable batteries.110 It has a theoretical storage capacity \nof 660 mAhg, which is almost twice as high as graphite (372 mAhg) that is currently used in \ncommercial lithiumion batteries (LIB), and double that of hard carbon in emerging sodiumion \nbatteries.1113 Recently, antimonybased anodes have been extended to include potassiumion \nbatteries.14,15 The range of antimonyalkali compounds that has been characterized is, however, \nconsiderably broader than just these two elements, and can include up to three alkali metal ions \nfrom group I, from lithium to cesium, with the number of intermediate compounds increasing as \none moves down the group of the periodic table.16,17 In contrast to the more widely studied tin \nanodes, antimony shows good performance in conventional commercial carbonatebased \nelectrolytes, making it a more suitable candidate to replace graphite in LIBs.1820 \nBismuth is isostructural with antimony and the elements have full mutual solid \nsolubility above 200 C.17 However, thermodynamic calculations suggest there is a miscibility \ngap below 140 C.21 Like antimony, bismuth also alloys with up to three molar equivalents of \nalkali metals from lithium to cesium.16,17 Since bismuth is much more ductile than antimony, it \nmakes the material less susceptible to fracture during electrochemical cycling with lithium, and \nthere are several examples of bismuth addition to antimony improving the cycling stability \nrelative to either element by itself.2,8 Although insitu diffraction data of the individual elements \nduring lithiation are available and show that A3Bi and A3Sb (A  Li, Na, K) are isostructural,15,22\n25 no such data exist on binary SbBi solid solutions. pubchem: ['Name: Potassium\\nText:\\nPotassium is a soft silvery metal though normally grayish white due to oxidation.\\nPotassium, metal alloys is potassium mixed with some other metal, usually sodium. It is a liquid under normal conditions. It reacts vigorously with water to form potassium hydroxide, a corrosive material and hydrogen, a flammable gas.

It is used as a heat exchange fluid.\\nPotassium atom is an alkali metal atom. It has a role as a macronutrient and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite.\\nPotassium is an essential nutrient, like [Calcium] and [Magnesium]. It was identified as a shortfall nutrient by the 2015-2020 Advisory Committee of Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Many conditions and diseases interfere with normal body potassium balance, and underconsumption of potassium is one example. Hypokalemia (low potassium) or hyperkalemia (high potassium) may result, manifesting as various signs and symptoms. Some examples of potassium-related complications include life-threatening arrhythmia, neuromuscular dysfunction, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.  Various pharmacological preparations have been formulated to replenish potassium. They are available in an assortment of tablet, injection, and other forms, depending on the setting and condition being treated. Potassium is often a key ingredient for intravenous fluids, given to patients in clinical settings for rehydration, nutrition, and replenishment of electrolytes.

It is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge (which combines with anions to form salts). In nature, potassium occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks.\\nPotassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first ionization energy, which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. It was first suggested in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts, which was demonstrated in 1807 when elemental potassium was first isolated via electrolysis. Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which 40K is radioactive. Traces of 40K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.\\nPotassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from outside to inside cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.\\nMost industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility of its compounds in water, such as saltwater soap. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Sodium-dependent symporter isomerization", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alternating access", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "sodium-potassium pump", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Sodium-Glucose Cotransport", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Sodium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Sodium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Potassium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Na+/K+ antiport", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alternating access model", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F), about 500 °C (932 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys – in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −4 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination complexes; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.\"]\nThe use of maingroup elements in sensing \napplications has expanded greatly in recent years. The Lewis acidic character of many maingroup \nelements has allowed for the development of sensors \nfor an array of substrates, including halide ions,1 and \nsmall molecules such as nitrous oxide and carbon \nmonoxide.2 Another key class of substrates for such \nsensors are metal ions. The sensing of metal ions \nused in biological processes, such as iron and copper, \nis vital for medical contexts whereby either an excess \nor deficiency can cause health issues.3 The ability to \nsense metal ions not directly involved in biological \nprocesses, \nsuch \nas \naluminium, \nalso \nretains \nimportance due to their toxicity at even low \nconcentrations.4 Therefore, sensors that can detect \nthese metals quickly and selectively is of widespread \ninterest. wikipedia: [\"A sensor is often defined as a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus. The stimulus is the quantity, property, or condition that is sensed and converted into electrical signal.\\nIn the broadest definition, a sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem that detects events or changes in its environment and sends the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. \\nSensors are used in everyday objects such as touch-sensitive elevator buttons (tactile sensor) and lamps which dim or brighten by touching the base, and in innumerable applications of which most people are never aware. With advances in micromachinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the uses of sensors have expanded beyond the traditional fields of temperature, pressure and flow measurement, for example into MARG sensors.\\nAnalog sensors such as potentiometers and force-sensing resistors are still widely used. Their applications include manufacturing and machinery, airplanes and aerospace, cars, medicine, robotics and many other aspects of our day-to-day life. There is a wide range of other sensors that measure chemical and physical properties of materials, including optical sensors for refractive index measurement, vibrational sensors for fluid viscosity measurement, and electro-chemical sensors for monitoring pH of fluids.\\nA sensor's sensitivity indicates how much its output changes when the input quantity it measures changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1  cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, its sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope dy/dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature thermometer inserted into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer.  Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.\\nTechnological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly faster measurement time and higher sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches. Due to the increasing demand for rapid, affordable and reliable information in today's world, disposable sensors—low-cost and easy‐to‐use devices for short‐term monitoring or single‐shot measurements—have recently gained growing importance. Using this class of sensors, critical analytical information can be obtained by anyone, anywhere and at any time, without the need for recalibration and worrying about contamination.\"]\nNoble metals with nanoscopic dimensions (nanostructures) strongly \ninteract with and hence harvest the incident light, thanks to their surface plasmon properties.13 \nAs a result, energetic charge carriers (hot electrons and holes), and a high local temperature are \ngenerated, offering new perspectives of lightdriven chemistry, known as plasmonic chemistry.4,5 \nPlasmonic nanocatalysis was shown to initiate novel reaction pathways described either via the \ngeneration of hot charge carriers or by a thermallyinduced mechanism.69The dimerization of 4\nnitrothiophenol and 4aminothiophenol have been considered as the first examples of plasmonic \nchemistry, followed by other reactions that are driven by plasmonic effects.1015 \nPlasmonic nanostructures made from gold, silver and copper nanoparticles exhibit a strong \nabsorption in the visible and nearinfrared range of the solar spectrum, unlike the traditional \nsemiconductors that catalyze chemical reactions only with the high energetic UV light.1618 \nImportantly, the optical properties of the plasmonic nanoparticles are largely dependent on their \nshape and size, which can be effectively tuned to capture specific photon energies. pubchem: [\"Name: Copper\\nText:\\nCopper is a metal that occurs naturally throughout the environment, in rocks, soil, water, and air. Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets. Copper compounds are commonly used in agriculture to treat plant diseases like mildew, for water treatment and, as preservatives for wood, leather, and fabrics.\\nReddish lustrous malleable odorless metallic solid.\\nCopper atom is a copper group element atom and a metal allergen. It has a role as a micronutrient and an Escherichia coli metabolite.\\nCopper is a transition metal and a trace element in the body.

Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD).\\nCopper is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nCopper is an essential trace element that is included in some over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, even though copper deficiency is quite rare and supplementation is rarely needed. The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.\\nCysteine is a naturally occurring, sulfur-containing amino acid that is found in most proteins, although only in small quantities. Cysteine is unique amongst the twenty natural amino acids as it contains a thiol group. Thiol groups can undergo oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions; when cysteine is oxidized it can form cystine, which is two cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bond. This reaction is reversible: as reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins. Cysteine is often involved in electron-transfer reactions, and help the enzyme catalyze its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant glutathione. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a form of cysteine where an acetyl group is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word kustis meaning bladder - cystine was first isolated from kidney stones. As cysteine contains a sulphydryl group, it can undergo redox reactions. Oxidation of cysteine can produce a disulfide bond with another thiol, or further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or sulfonic acids. The cysteine thiol group is also a nucleophile and can undergo addition and substitution reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionized, and cysteine residues in proteins have pKa values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive thiolate form in the cell. The thiol group also has a high affinity for heavy metals and proteins containing cysteine will bind metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly. Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has antioxidant properties. Cysteine is an important source of sulfur in human metabolism, and although it is classified as a non-essential amino acid, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from malabsorption syndromes. Cysteine may at some point be recognized as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid. Cysteine is important in energy metabolism. As cystine, it is a structural component of many tissues and hormones. Cysteine has clinical uses ranging from baldness to psoriasis to preventing smoker's hack. In some cases, oral cysteine therapy has proved excellent for treatment of asthmatics, enabling them to stop theophylline and other medications. Cysteine also enhances the effect of topically applied silver, tin and zinc salts in preventing dental cavities. In the future, cysteine may play a role in the treatment of cobalt toxicity, diabetes, psychosis, cancer and seizures.\\nA thiol-containing non-essential amino acid that is oxidized to form CYSTINE.\\nSee also: Cysteine Hydrochloride (has salt form) ...

Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so potential victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. H2S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes into contact with organic material, especially at high temperatures. Hydrogen sulfide is a covalent hydride chemically related to water (H2O) since oxygen and sulfur occur in the same periodic table group. It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, such as in swamps, and sewers (alongside the process of anaerobic digestion). It also occurs in volcanic gases, natural gas and some well waters. It is also important to note that Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle, the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth. As mentioned above, sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules in the absence of oxygen by reducing sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids. Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel, oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using oxygen or nitrate as oxidant.

Thiols are used as odorants to assist in the detection of natural gas (which in pure form is odorless), and the \"smell of natural gas\" is due to the smell of the thiol used as the odorant. \\nThiols are sometimes referred to as mercaptans () or mercapto compounds, a term introduced in 1832 by William Christopher Zeise and is derived from the Latin mercurio captāns (\\'capturing mercury\\') because the thiolate group (RS−) bonds very strongly with mercury compounds.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dehydroalanine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "thioether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "thioether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "thiazolidine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thioether crosslink", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thiazolidine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "thioacetal", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thioether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thiazolidine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thiazolidine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "1,1‐Dithioalkene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Disulfide bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Thiazolidine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Schiff base crosslink", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

This group is also known as the oxygen family. Group 16 consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive elements polonium (Po) and livermorium (Lv). Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \"chalcogen\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \"chalcogen\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word khalkos (χαλκός) principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze, brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore and coin), and the Latinized Greek word genēs, meaning born or produced.\\nSulfur has been known since antiquity, and oxygen was recognized as an element in the 18th century. Selenium, tellurium and polonium were discovered in the 19th century, and livermorium in 2000. All of the chalcogens have six valence electrons, leaving them two electrons short of a full outer shell. Their most common oxidation states are −2, +2, +4, and +6. They have relatively low atomic radii, especially the lighter ones.\\nAll of the naturally occurring chalcogens have some role in biological functions, either as a nutrient or a toxin. Selenium is an important nutrient (among others as a building block of selenocysteine) but is also commonly toxic. Tellurium often has unpleasant effects (although some organisms can use it), and polonium (especially the isotope polonium-210) is always harmful as a result of its radioactivity.\\nSulfur has more than 20 allotropes, oxygen has nine, selenium has at least eight, polonium has two, and only one crystal structure of tellurium has so far been discovered. There are numerous organic chalcogen compounds. Not counting oxygen, organic sulfur compounds are generally the most common, followed by organic selenium compounds and organic tellurium compounds. This trend also occurs with chalcogen pnictides and compounds containing chalcogens and carbon group elements.\\nOxygen is generally obtained by separation of air into nitrogen and oxygen. Sulfur is extracted from oil and natural gas. Selenium and tellurium are produced as byproducts of copper refining. Polonium is most available in naturally occurring actinide-containing materials.  Livermorium has been synthesized in particle accelerators. The primary use of elemental oxygen is in steelmaking. Sulfur is mostly converted into sulfuric acid, which is heavily used in the chemical industry. Selenium\\'s most common application is glassmaking. Tellurium compounds are mostly used in optical disks, electronic devices, and solar cells.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.

It is also known as vinylbenzene, ethenylbenzene, cinnamene, or phenylethylene. It's a colorless liquid that evaporates easily and has a sweet smell. It often contains other chemicals that give it a sharp, unpleasant smell. It dissolves in some liquids but doesn't dissolve easily in water. Billions of pounds are produced each year to make products such as rubber, plastic, insulation, fiberglass, pipes, automobile parts, food containers, and carpet backing. Most of these products contain styrene linked together in a long chain (polystyrene) as well as unlinked styrene. Low levels of styrene also occur naturally in a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, beverages, and meats.\\nStyrene can cause cancer according to The National Toxicology Program.\\nStyrene monomer, stabilized appears as a clear colorless to dark liquid with an aromatic odor. Vapors heavier than air and irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes. Subject to polymerization. If the polymerization takes place inside a closed container, the container may rupture violently. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Used to make plastics, paints, and synthetic rubber.\\nStyrene is a vinylarene that is benzene carrying a vinyl group. It has been isolated from the benzoin resin produced by Styrax species. It has a role as a mutagen, a plant metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a vinylarene, a volatile organic compound and a member of styrenes.\\nStyrene is primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins. Acute (short-term) exposure to styrene in humans results in mucous membrane and eye irritation, and gastrointestinal effects. Chronic (long-term) exposure to styrene in humans results in effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as headache, fatigue, weakness, and depression, CSN dysfunction, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Human studies are inconclusive on the reproductive and developmental effects of styrene; several studies did not report an increase in developmental effects in women who worked in the plastics industry, while an increased frequency of spontaneous abortions and decreased frequency of births were reported in another study. Several epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an association between styrene exposure and an increased risk of leukemia and lymphoma. However, the evidence is inconclusive due to confounding factors. EPA has not given a formal carcinogen classification to styrene.\\nStyrene has been reported in Oecophylla smaragdina, Punica granatum, and other organisms with data available.\\nStyrene is found in alcoholic beverages. Styrene is present in cranberry, bilberry, currants, grapes, vinegar, parsley, milk and dairy products, whisky, cocoa, coffee, tea, roasted filberts and peanuts. Styrene is a flavouring ingredient. Polymers are used in ion-exchange resins in food processing. Indirect food additive arising from adhesives, oatings and packaging materials. Styrene, also known as vinyl benzene, is a colorless oily liquid that evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations confer a less pleasant odor.

The compound evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations have a less pleasant odor. Styrene is the precursor to polystyrene and several copolymers, and is typically made from benzene for this purpose. Approximately 25 million tonnes of styrene were produced in 2010, increasing to around 35 million tonnes by 2018.']\nThiols contain a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom (SH), the high electron density of\nthe sulfur atom makes the thiol group a potent nucleophile. As a result, thiols can undergo a\nvariety of reactions, including oxidation, reduction, and substitution reactions, making them\nan attractive target for electrophilic compounds including the thiol switch mechanism. The\nthiol switch mechanism involves the reversible modification of thiol groups in biomolecules\nby electrophilic compounds. This mechanism is mediated by the formation of a covalent bond\nbetween the electrophile and the thiol group, which leads to changes in the biomolecules\nactivity and function.4 Thiol switches have emerged as a promising approach for modulating\nthe pharmacological properties of drug candidates. wikipedia: ['Redox ( RED-oks,  REE-doks, reduction–oxidation or oxidation–reduction:\\u200a150\\u200a) is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of the reactants change. Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state, while reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state. The oxidation and reduction processes occur simultaneously in the chemical reaction.\\nThere are two classes of redox reactions:\\n\\nElectron-transfer – Only one (usually) electron flows from the atom, ion, or molecule being oxidized to the atom, ion, or molecule that is reduced. This type of redox reaction is often discussed in terms of redox couples and electrode potentials.\\nAtom transfer – An atom transfers from one substrate to another.  For example, in the rusting of iron, the oxidation state of iron atoms increases as the iron converts to an oxide, and simultaneously, the oxidation state of oxygen decreases as it accepts electrons released by the iron. Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with forming oxides, other chemical species can serve the same function.

They are coupled with G proteins. They pass through the cell membrane seven times in the form of six loops (three extracellular loops interacting with ligand molecules, three intracellular loops interacting with G proteins, an N-terminal extracellular region and a C-terminal intracellular region) of amino acid residues, which is why they are sometimes referred to as seven-transmembrane receptors. Ligands can bind either to the extracellular N-terminus and loops (e.g. glutamate receptors) or to the binding site within transmembrane helices (rhodopsin-like family). They are all activated by agonists, although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor has also been observed. \\nG protein-coupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, and choanoflagellates. The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include light-sensitive compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters. They vary in size from small molecules to peptides, to large proteins. G protein-coupled receptors are involved in many diseases.\\nThere are two principal signal transduction pathways involving the G protein-coupled receptors:\\n\\nthe cAMP signal pathway and\\nthe phosphatidylinositol signal pathway.\\nWhen a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change in the GPCR, which allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated G protein by exchanging the GDP bound to the G protein for a GTP. The G protein's α subunit, together with the bound GTP, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further affect intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13).:\\u200a1160\\u200a\\nGPCRs are an important drug target and approximately 34% of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs target 108 members of this family.

Its biological function is complex, touching on diverse functions including mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and vasoconstriction.\\nSerotonin is produced in the central nervous system (CNS), specifically in the brainstem's raphe nuclei, the skin's Merkel cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and the tongue's taste receptor cells. Approximately 90% of the serotonin the human body produces is in the gastrointestinal tract's enterochromaffin cells, where it regulates intestinal movements. Additionally, it is stored in blood platelets and is released during agitation and vasoconstriction, where it then acts as an agonist to other platelets. About 8% is found in platelets and 1–2% in the CNS.\\nThe serotonin is secreted luminally and basolaterally, which leads to increased serotonin uptake by circulating platelets and activation after stimulation, which gives increased stimulation of myenteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. The remainder is synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the CNS, where it has various functions, including the regulation of mood, appetite, and sleep.\\nSerotonin secreted from the enterochromaffin cells eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, which can serve as a vasoconstrictor or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II and norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium – such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In normal physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells and the inhibition of the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.\\nBiochemically, the indoleamine molecule derives from the amino acid tryptophan. Serotonin is metabolized mainly to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), chiefly by the liver.\\nSeveral classes of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), interfere with the normal reabsorption of serotonin after it is done with the transmission of the signal, therefore augmenting the neurotransmitter levels in the synapses.\\nBesides mammals, serotonin is found in all bilateral animals including worms and insects, as well as in fungi and in plants. Serotonin's presence in insect venoms and plant spines serves to cause pain, which is a side-effect of serotonin injection. Serotonin is produced by pathogenic amoebae, causing diarrhea in the human gut. Its widespread presence in many seeds and fruits may serve to stimulate the digestive tract into expelling the seeds.\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2 receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2C receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT2A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-Hydroxytryptamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT1A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT1A receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-hydroxytryptamine receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Serotonin receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "5-HT receptor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Valine-Proline-Proline (VPP)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "IPP", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lactotripeptide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ile-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "VPP", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Ile", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Val-Pro-Pro", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-based ligands coordination", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "square planar", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "FeN4", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "square planar", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Square-planar FeN4", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Square planar", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen coordination", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "square planar", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit the air, soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep biosphere of Earth\\'s crust. Bacteria play a vital role in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients and the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies; bacteria are responsible for the putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide and methane, to energy. Bacteria also live in mutualistic, commensal and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. Most bacteria have not been characterised and there are many species that cannot be grown in the laboratory. The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.\\nLike all animals, humans carry vast numbers (approximately 1013 to 1014) of bacteria. Most are in the gut, though there are many on the skin. Most of the bacteria in and on the body are harmless or rendered so by the protective effects of the immune system, and many are beneficial, particularly the ones in the gut. However, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis, tetanus and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. Bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector (biomining, bioleaching), as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.\\nOnce regarded as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes (\"fission fungi\"), bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells contain circular chromosomes, do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea. Unlike Archaea, bacteria contain ester-linked lipids in the cell membrane, are resistant to diphtheria toxin, use formylmethionine in protein synthesis initiation, and have numerous genetic differences, including a different 16S rRNA.']\nThe production of greenhouse gases has had an adverse impact on humans and their activities since the \nbeginning of the industrial age.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the atmosphere, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\\nOzone's odor is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air. Ozone's O3 structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be weakly diamagnetic. At standard temperature and pressure, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures, physical shock, or fast warming to the boiling point. It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.\\nOzone is a powerful oxidizing agent (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\"]\nDirect air capture (DAC) technologies are projected to \nplay a crucial role in addressing climate change by \nremoving carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, \nallowing us to mitigate the longterm consequences of \nexisting atmospheric carbon dioxide and achieve netzero \nemissions.1, 2 The key component in DAC technologies is \nthe material used to capture and separate CO2 from the air. pubchem: ['Name: Carbon Dioxide\\nText:\\nCarbon dioxide appears as a colorless odorless gas at atmospheric temperatures and pressures.

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere.

Formalin free of methanol is also shipped but must be kept warm (about 30 °C (86 °F)) to prevent polymerization.

Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere.

A new application of ruthenium is as the capping layer for extreme ultraviolet photomasks.

The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media, electronic semiconductor devices, integrated passive devices, light-emitting diodes, optical coatings (such as antireflective coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g. thin-film solar cells) and storage (thin-film batteries).

It also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), used in laser pointers, lidar, and free-space optical communication. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which permits them to emit light with a very narrow frequency spectrum. Temporal coherence can also be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as an attosecond.\\nLasers are used in fiber-optic and free-space optical communications, optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, semiconductor chip manufacturing (photolithography, etching), laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment.

Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal complexes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lindlar catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lindlar catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Transition metal complex", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Transition metal complex", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ruthenium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ruthenium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Transition metal complexes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen ion mobility", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Cerium oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cerium oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cerium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen Storage Capacity", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen vacancy formation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Redox activity", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Oxygen nonstoichiometry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

All but one of the lanthanides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell. Lutetium is a d-block element (thus also a transition metal), and on this basis its inclusion has been questioned; however, like its congeners scandium and yttrium in group 3, it behaves similarly to the other 14. The term rare-earth element or rare-earth metal is often used to include the stable group 3 elements Sc, Y, and Lu in addition to the 4f elements.

In contrast, the novel organotitaniumbased system\nintegrates water splitting and CO reduction into a single, continuous process, producing oxygenated\norganics directly from ambient CO (0.04). This capability to convert trace amounts of CO into\nvaluable materials represents a significant leap in AP technology.\nTo the \nbest of our knowledge, the incorporation of titanium in \nsuch precursor material and its further crystallization \ninto fully functional hierarchical TS1 catalyst by SAC \nhas never been reported. We aim to demonstrate that \ncontrolling the incorporation of titanium during the \npreparation of the precursor particles prior to the \nthermal treatment allows obtaining TS1 presenting \nboth proper Ti speciation in the MFItype structure and \na \nsecondary \nintracrystalline \nmacroporosity. The \nsuccessful conversion of the amorphous material into \ncrystalline TS1 is exploited in the catalytic conversion \nof allyl alcohol into glycidol in water, and compared to \nthe benchmark microporous TS1 catalyst. 2.

Found in nature only as an oxide, it can be reduced to produce a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength, resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.\\nTitanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of minerals, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere; it is found in almost all living things, as well as bodies of water, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide (TiO2), is a popular photocatalyst and is used in the manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.\\nTitanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, among other elements. The resulting titanium alloys are strong, lightweight, and versatile, with applications including aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, desalination plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agriculture (farming), sporting goods, jewelry, and consumer electronics. Titanium is also considered one of the most biocompatible metals, leading to a range of medical applications including prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental implants, and surgical instruments.\\nThe two most useful properties of the metal are corrosion resistance and strength-to-density ratio, the highest of any metallic element. In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense. There are two allotropic forms and five naturally occurring isotopes of this element, 46Ti through 50Ti, with 48Ti being the most abundant (73.8%).\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Organic carboxylic acids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Formate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Formate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "higher alcohols", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alcohols", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alcohols", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aldehydes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alcohols", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "hydrocarbons", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "1-decanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fatty acids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fatty acids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Formates", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ethanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

However, a critical limitation of lithium metal anodes for SSBs is the loss of contact at the SSE interface \nduring lithium stripping (i.e., battery discharge) due to void formation (1,2,5,6). The formation of voids is \ndetrimental because they cause high interfacial impedance and current focusing during charging, resulting \nin lithium filament growth, short circuiting, and cell failure (710). The mechanisms governing void formation are complex, and the process is affected by current \ndensity, stack pressure, chemomechanics, and other factors (7,9,1115).

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Crown Ether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "18-crown-6", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Crown ether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Crown ether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "crown ether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "crown ether", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dinitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "18-crown-6", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster.  It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.\\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three-quarters of lithium production.\\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts. It has no established metabolic function in humans.

Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical vapor deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical vapor deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical vapor deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "graphitization", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nickel", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalytic decomposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nGraphene oxide (GO) is a promising twodimensional (2D) material with high specific \nsurface area.

Despite the nearly transparent nature of a single graphene sheet, graphite (formed from stacked layers of graphene) appears black because it absorbs all visible light wavelengths. On a microscopic scale, graphene is the strongest material ever measured.\\n\\nThe existence of graphene was first theorized in 1947 by Philip R. Wallace during his research on graphite\\'s electronic properties, while the term graphene was first defined by Hanns-Peter Boehm in 1987. In 2004, the material was isolated and characterized by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester using a piece of graphite and adhesive tape. In 2010, Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\".  While small amounts of graphene are easy to produce using the method by which it was originally isolated, attempts to scale and automate the manufacturing process for mass production have had limited success due to cost-effectiveness and quality control concerns. The global graphene market was $9 million in 2012, with most of the demand from research and development in semiconductors, electronics, electric batteries, and composites.\\nThe IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) advises using the term \"graphite\" for the three-dimensional material and reserving \"graphene\" for discussions about the properties or reactions of single-atom layers.

There are two main types of carbon sequestration: biologic (also called biosequestration) and geologic.  \\nBiologic carbon sequestration is a naturally occurring process as part of the carbon cycle. Humans can enhance it through deliberate actions and use of technology. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes can be accelerated for example through changes in land use and agricultural practices, called carbon farming. Artificial processes have also been devised to produce similar effects. This approach is called carbon capture and storage. It involves using technology to capture and sequester (store) CO2 that is produced from human activities underground or under the sea bed. \\nPlants, such as forests and kelp beds, absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow, and bind it into biomass. However, these biological stores may be temporary carbon sinks, as long-term sequestration cannot be guaranteed. Wildfires, disease, economic pressures, and changing political priorities may release the sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere.\\nCarbon dioxide that has been removed from the atmosphere can also be stored in the Earth\\'s crust by injecting it underground, or in the form of insoluble carbonate salts. The latter process is called mineral sequestration. These methods are considered non-volatile because they not only remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but also sequester it indefinitely. This means the carbon is \"locked away\" for thousands to millions of years.\\nTo enhance carbon sequestration processes in oceans the following chemical or physical technologies have been proposed: ocean fertilization, artificial upwelling, basalt storage, mineralization and deep-sea sediments, and adding bases to neutralize acids. However, none have achieved large scale application so far. Large-scale seaweed farming on the other hand is a biological process and could sequester significant amounts of carbon. The potential growth of seaweed for carbon farming would see the harvested seaweed transported to the deep ocean for long-term burial.

The CH bond dissociation \nenergy of CH4 is 104 kcal mol1, which was higher than that of CHCl3 (95.7 kcal mol1).9 These results \nprompted us to investigate the generation of COCl2 through the oxygenation of CHCl3 with ClO2", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450 Catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Photoredox Catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "C-H bond", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Photocatalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxidative addition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxidative addition", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Heck reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cytochrome P450", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Hydroxylation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Aluminum is often mixed with small amounts of other metals to form aluminum alloys, which are stronger and harder. Aluminum compounds have many different uses, for example, as alums in water-treatment and alumina in abrasives and furnace linings. They are also found in consumer products such as antacids, astringents, buffered aspirin, food additives, and antiperspirants.\\nAluminium(0) is an elemental aluminium.\\nA metallic element that has the atomic number 13, atomic symbol Al, and atomic weight 26.98.\\nAluminum is a metallic element in the boron group with atomic symbol Al, atomic number 13, and atomic weight 27.\\nAluminium is a mineral with formula of Al.

Data indicate that aluminum contaminates much of the raw material used to manufacture solutions used for intravenous nutritional support of hospitalized and ambulatory patients, and that pharmaceutical manufacturers have only recently obtained the technology necessary to detect aluminum contamination of their products. As a result, aluminum bypassed normal barriers and entered the blood, accumulating in tissues such as bone, liver and the central nervous system with toxic consequences. Now that the FDA has finally issued a rule governing aluminum contamination in these solutions, manufacturers will need to develop methods to minimize such contamination; scientists should also realize that when data they obtain indicate a serious problem in the manufacturing sector they should be sure that the problem is properly addressed.

It has a density lower than that of other common metals, about one-third that of steel. Aluminium has a great affinity towards oxygen, forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. It visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic, and ductile. It has one stable isotope, 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the 12th-most abundant element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al leads to it being used in radiometric dating.\\nChemically, aluminium is a post-transition metal in the boron group; as is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 oxidation state. The aluminium cation Al3+ is small and highly charged; as such, it has more polarizing power, and bonds formed by aluminium have a more covalent character. The strong affinity of aluminium for oxygen leads to the common occurrence of its oxides in nature. Aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the crust, where it is the third-most abundant element, after oxygen and silicon, rather than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free metal. It is obtained industrially by mining bauxite, a sedimentary rock rich in aluminium minerals.\\nThe discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the Hall–Héroult process developed independently by French engineer Paul Héroult and American engineer Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In the First and Second World Wars, aluminium was a crucial strategic resource for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.\\nDespite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to metabolize aluminium salts, but this aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of interest, and studies are ongoing.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Corrosion resistance", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aluminum", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aluminum", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Aluminium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "strength", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

License CC BY 4.0 wikipedia: ['A Lewis acid (named for the American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis) is a chemical species that contains an empty orbital which is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base to form a Lewis adduct. A Lewis base, then, is any species that has a filled orbital containing an electron pair which is not involved in bonding but may form a dative bond with a Lewis acid to form a Lewis adduct. For example, NH3 is a Lewis base, because it can donate its lone pair of electrons. Trimethylborane [(CH3)3B] is a Lewis acid as it is capable of accepting a lone pair. In a Lewis adduct, the Lewis acid and base share an electron pair furnished by the Lewis base, forming a dative bond. In the context of a specific chemical reaction between NH3 and Me3B, a lone pair from NH3 will form a dative bond with the empty orbital of Me3B to form an adduct NH3•BMe3. The terminology refers to the contributions of Gilbert N. Lewis.\\nThe terms nucleophile and electrophile are sometimes interchangeable with Lewis base and Lewis acid, respectively. These terms, especially their abstract noun forms nucleophilicity and electrophilicity, emphasize the kinetic aspect of reactivity, while the Lewis basicity and Lewis acidity emphasize the thermodynamic aspect of Lewis adduct formation.']\nDuring this process, ringopening of the \ntransient cyclic orthoester would result in the formation of an allylic \nacetate, which could sequentially undergo a classical TsujiTrost \nreaction in the presence of a palladium catalyst.

Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.\\nALCOHOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and has 3 approved and 41 investigational indications.\\nEthanol is a clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages. Indeed, ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption, including scents, flavorings, colorings, and medicines. Ethanol has a depressive effect on the central nervous system and because of its psychoactive effects, it is considered a drug. Ethanol has a complex mode of action and affects multiple systems in the brain, most notably it acts as an agonist to the GABA receptors. Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol level reaches 0.4%. A blood level of 0.5% or more is commonly fatal. Levels of even less than 0.1% can cause intoxication, with unconsciousness often occurring at 0.3-0.4 %. Ethanol is metabolized by the body as an energy-providing carbohydrate nutrient, as it metabolizes into acetyl CoA, an intermediate common with glucose metabolism, that can be used for energy in the citric acid cycle or for biosynthesis. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and then into acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The product of the first step of this breakdown, acetaldehyde, is more toxic than ethanol. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver,[77] multiple forms of cancer, and alcoholism. Industrially, ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene, and biologically, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Small amounts of ethanol are endogenously produced by gut microflora through anaerobic fermentation. However most ethanol detected in biofluids and tissues likely comes from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Absolute ethanol or anhydrous alcohol generally refers to purified ethanol, containing no more than one percent water. Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. It often contains trace amounts of toxic benzene (used to remove water by azeotropic distillation). Consumption of this form of ethanol can be fatal over a short time period. Generally absolute or pure ethanol is used as a solvent for lab and industrial settings where water will disrupt a desired reaction. Pure ethanol is classed as 200 proof in the USA and Canada, equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.\\nEthanol is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body.

Copper is an essential element in plants and animals (including humans), which means it is necessary for us to live. Therefore, plants and animals must absorb some copper from eating, drinking, and breathing. Copper is used to make many different kinds of products like wire, plumbing pipes, and sheet metal. U.S. pennies made before 1982 are made of copper, while those made after 1982 are only coated with copper. Copper is also combined with other metals to make brass and bronze pipes and faucets. Copper compounds are commonly used in agriculture to treat plant diseases like mildew, for water treatment and, as preservatives for wood, leather, and fabrics.\\nReddish lustrous malleable odorless metallic solid.\\nCopper atom is a copper group element atom and a metal allergen. It has a role as a micronutrient and an Escherichia coli metabolite.\\nCopper is a transition metal and a trace element in the body.

Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD).\\nCopper is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nCopper is an essential trace element that is included in some over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplements, even though copper deficiency is quite rare and supplementation is rarely needed. The amounts of copper found in typical supplements has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with clinically apparent liver injury. However, accidental or intentional copper overdose can cause an acute liver injury and chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of copper can result in copper overload and chronic liver injury.\\nCopper has been reported in Artemia salina, Crotalaria prolongata, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nCopper is an element with atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.\\nCopper is a mineral with formula of Cu. The IMA symbol is Cu.\\nCopper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. Physiologically, it exists as an ion in the body. In animals, it is found primarily in the bloodstream, as a cofactor in various enzymes, and in copper-based pigments. In the body, copper shifts between the cuprous (Cu1+) and cupric (Cu2+) forms, though the majority of the body's copper is in the Cu2+ form. The ability of copper to easily accept and donate electrons explains its important role in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions and in scavenging free radicals. Copper is a critical functional component of a number of essential enzymes known as cuproenzymes. For instance, the copper-dependent enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase, plays a critical role in cellular energy production. By catalyzing the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O), cytochrome c oxidase generates an electrical gradient used by the mitochondria to create the vital energy-storing molecule, ATP. Another cuproenzyme, lysyl oxidase, is required for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, which are essential for the formation of strong and flexible connective tissue. Another cuproeznyme, Monoamine oxidase (MAO), plays a role in the metabolism of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. MAO also functions in the degradation of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is the basis for the use of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants. One of the most important cuproenzymes is Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD functions as an antioxidant by catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals (free radicals or ROS) to hydrogen peroxide, which can subsequently be reduced to water by other antioxidant enzymes. Two forms of SOD contain copper: 1) copper/zinc SOD is found within most cells of the body, including red blood cells, and 2) extracellular SOD is a copper-containing enzyme found at high levels in the lungs and low levels in blood plasma. In sufficient amounts, copper can be poisonous or even fatal to organisms. Copper is normally bound to cuproenzymes (such as SOD, MOA) and is thus only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. It is believed that zinc and copper compete for absorption in the digestive tract so that a diet that is excessive in one of these minerals may result in a deficiency in the other. An imbalance of zinc and copper status might be involved in human hypertension.\\nA heavy metal trace element with the atomic symbol Cu, atomic number 29, and atomic weight 63.55.\\nSee also: Copper Gluconate (active moiety of); Copper Naphthenate (active moiety of); Cupric sulfate, basic copper sulfate dibasic (active moiety of) ...

This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground.

It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion.

Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

The double bond may be internal or at the terminal position. Terminal alkenes are also known as α-olefins.\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends using the name \"alkene\" only for acyclic hydrocarbons with just one double bond; alkadiene, alkatriene, etc., or polyene for acyclic hydrocarbons with two or more double bonds; cycloalkene, cycloalkadiene, etc. for cyclic ones; and \"olefin\" for the general class – cyclic or acyclic, with one or more double bonds.\\nAcyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups (also known as mono-enes) form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n with n being a >1 natural number (which is two hydrogens less than the corresponding alkane). When n is four or more, isomers are possible, distinguished by the position and conformation of the double bond.\\nAlkenes are generally colorless non-polar compounds, somewhat similar to alkanes but more reactive. The first few members of the series are gases or liquids at room temperature.  The simplest alkene, ethylene (C2H4) (or \"ethene\" in the IUPAC nomenclature) is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially.\\nAromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, however their structure and properties are sufficiently distinct that they are not classified as alkenes or olefins. Hydrocarbons with two overlapping double bonds (C=C=C) are called allenes—the simplest such compound is itself called allene—and those with three or more overlapping bonds (C=C=C=C, C=C=C=C=C, etc.) are called cumulenes.']\nSynthetic strategies towards bbranched amino acids \nA breakthrough was reached upon recognition that the bbranched \namino acid motifs for both 3 and 4 could, in principle, be derived \nfrom aziridine ring openings (Figure 1).

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen oxides", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "rust", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Silver oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon monoxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "iron oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Rust", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Rust", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Rust", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chromium oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Chemically, iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, and the most electropositive halogen after astatine. However, iodine does not occur in the free state in nature. As with all other halogens , when freed from its compounds iodine forms diatomic molecules (I2). Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in medicine, photography, and dyes. Iodine is required for the production of thyroid hormones, which are essential for normal brain development, and the fetus, newborn, and young child are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. Physiologically, iodine exists as an ion in the body. The iodine requirement increases during pregnancy and recommended intakes are in the range of 220-250 microg/day. Monitoring iodine status during pregnancy is a challenge. New recommendations from World Health Organization suggest that a median urinary iodine concentration >250 microg/L and <500 microg/L indicates adequate iodine intake in pregnancy. Based on this range, it appears that many pregnant women in have inadequate intakes. Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration in the newborn is a sensitive indicator of mild iodine deficiency in late pregnancy. The potential adverse effects of mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy are uncertain. Controlled trials of iodine supplementation in mildly iodine-deficient pregnant women suggest beneficial effects on maternal and newborn serum thyroglobulin and thyroid volume, but no effects on maternal and newborn total or free thyroid hormone concentrations. There are no long-term data on the effect of iodine supplementation on birth outcomes or infant development. New data from well-controlled studies indicate that iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient school-age children has clear benefits: it improves cognitive and motor function; it also increases concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, and improves somatic growth.

The element was discovered by the French chemist Bernard Courtois in 1811 and was named two years later by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, after the Ancient Greek Ιώδης, meaning 'violet'.\\nIodine occurs in many oxidation states, including iodide (I−), iodate (IO−3), and the various periodate anions. As the heaviest essential mineral nutrient, iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities.\\nThe dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat thyroid cancer.

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metalated Photocatalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "oxygen", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "metalloporphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metalloporphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal oxide catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt(II) oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cobalt phthalocyanine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cobalt phthalocyanine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metalloporphyrin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metallo-organic photocatalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-oxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "transition metal catalyst", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-doped Metal-Free Polymer Catalysts", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "N-doped carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "N-doped carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "nitrogen-doped carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-doped carbon nitride photocatalysts", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphitic Carbon Nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Polyaniline", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-doped carbon-based photocatalysts", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "graphitic carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen‐doped graphitic carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Nitrogen-doped polymers", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Graphitic Carbon Nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "graphitic carbon nitride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases. \\nNucleophilic describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis. Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution, whereby a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge, and nucleophilic addition. Nucleophilicity is closely related to basicity. The difference between the two is, that basicity is a thermodynamic property (i.e. relates to an equilibrium state), but nucleophilicity is a kinetic property, which relates to rates of certain chemical reactions.\"]\nThe chemical reduction of aromatic compounds (aromatic ketones, aromatic aldehydes, \nquinolines, etc.) through heterogeneous catalysis is an important field in the industrial \nhydrogenation process1 210.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state, while reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state. The oxidation and reduction processes occur simultaneously in the chemical reaction.\\nThere are two classes of redox reactions:\\n\\nElectron-transfer – Only one (usually) electron flows from the atom, ion, or molecule being oxidized to the atom, ion, or molecule that is reduced. This type of redox reaction is often discussed in terms of redox couples and electrode potentials.\\nAtom transfer – An atom transfers from one substrate to another.  For example, in the rusting of iron, the oxidation state of iron atoms increases as the iron converts to an oxide, and simultaneously, the oxidation state of oxygen decreases as it accepts electrons released by the iron. Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with forming oxides, other chemical species can serve the same function.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nResiniferatoxin was recently granted \nBreakthrough Therapy by the FDA for pain caused by osteoarthritis in the knee, increasing \nmobility.

Nearly all of the world's current supply of hydrogen is created from fossil fuels. Most hydrogen is gray hydrogen made through steam methane reforming. In this process, hydrogen is produced from a chemical reaction between steam and methane, the main component of natural gas. Producing one tonne of hydrogen through this process emits 6.6–9.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide. When carbon capture and storage is used to remove a large fraction of these emissions, the product is known as blue hydrogen.\\nGreen hydrogen is usually understood to be produced from renewable electricity via electrolysis of water. Less frequently, definitions of green hydrogen  include hydrogen produced from other low-emission sources such as biomass.

This process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the absorbent). While adsorption does often precede absorption, which involves the transfer of the absorbate into the volume of the absorbent material, alternatively, adsorption is distinctly a surface phenomenon, wherein the adsorbate does not penetrate through the material surface and into the bulk of the adsorbent. The term sorption encompasses both adsorption and absorption, and desorption is the reverse of sorption.\\n\\nLike surface tension, adsorption is a consequence of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are fulfilled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms on the surface of the adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or chemisorption (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction. The nature of the adsorption can affect the structure of the adsorbed species. For example, polymer physisorption from solution can result in squashed structures on a surface.\\nAdsorption is present in many natural, physical, biological and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts, activated charcoal, capturing and using waste heat to provide cold water for air conditioning and other process requirements (adsorption chillers), synthetic resins, increasing storage capacity of carbide-derived carbons and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography are sorption processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase to the surface of insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed in a column. Pharmaceutical industry applications, which use adsorption as a means to prolong neurological exposure to specific drugs or parts thereof, are lesser known.\\nThe word \"adsorption\" was coined in 1881 by German physicist Heinrich Kayser (1853–1940).']\nIn contrast to the ready \naccess to 15N labelled proteins afforded through expression in 15N enriched media, it is more challenging \nand costly, to incorporate 15N through chemical synthesis.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nA detailed analysis of the Raman spectra of SiCN deposited \nwith a temperature variation as well as of carbon nitride with nitrogen flow rate has been published \npreviously 1, 2, 3 \nA flow rate of 5 sccm was maintained for C2H2 while flow of nitrogen was varied as 5, 15, 30 and 60 sccm.

Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table, often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe, estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bond to form N2, a colourless and odourless diatomic gas. N2 forms about 78% of Earth\\'s atmosphere, making it the most abundant chemical species in air. Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds, nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth.\\nIt was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772 and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time. The name nitrogène was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Ancient Greek: ἀζωτικός \"no life\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; this name is used in a number of languages, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.\\nElemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology. About 2/3 of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert (oxygen-free) gas for commercial uses such as food packaging, and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications. Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, but at the same time it means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.  Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. \\nNitrogen occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins), in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then back into the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolising into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Activated Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic framework", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic framework", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-Organic Frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolites", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Palladium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-Organic Frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Metal-organic frameworks", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary gave rise to the Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and many other species 66 million years ago, now known to be produced by the impact that formed the Chicxulub crater. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.\"]\nAmong the observed ices, water ice is the most abun\ndant followed by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as smaller\namounts of organic molecules such as methane (CH4) and methanol (CH3OH)23.

The formation of different organic molecules in\nenvironments where temperatures are greater than 30 K can be explained via radi\ncal recombination mechanisms; the formation of radicals is followed by diffusion and\nrecombination into larger molecular species5, 29, 30.

Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called brimstone, which means \"burning stone\". Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.\\nSulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life.

PFAS came into use with the invention of Teflon in 1938 to make fluoropolymer coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease, and water. They are now used in products including waterproof fabric such as Nylon, yoga pants, carpets, shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, heat-resistant non-stick cooking surfaces such as Teflon, firefighting foam, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used by the cosmetic industry in most cosmetics and personal care products, including lipstick, eye liner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, and nail polish.\\nMany PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA pose health and environmental concerns because they are persistent organic pollutants; they were branded as \"forever chemicals\" in an article in The Washington Post in 2018. Some have half-lives of over eight years due to a carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest in organic chemistry. They move through soils and bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife, which are then eaten by humans. Residues are now commonly found in rain, drinking water, and wastewater. Since PFAS compounds are highly mobile, they are readily absorbed through human skin and through tear ducts, and such products on lips are often unwittingly ingested. Due to the large number of PFAS, it is challenging to study and assess the potential human health and environmental risks; more research is necessary and is ongoing.\\nExposure to PFAS, some of which have been classified as carcinogenic and/or as endocrine disruptors, has been linked to cancers such as kidney, prostate and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, suboptimal antibody response / decreased immunity, decreased fertility, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, reduced infant and fetal growth and developmental issues in children, obesity, dyslipidemia (abnormally high cholesterol), and higher rates of hormone interference.\\nThe use of PFAS has been regulated internationally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants since 2009, with some jurisdictions, such as China and the European Union, planning further reductions and phase-outs. However, major producers and users such as the United States, Israel, and Malaysia have not ratified the agreement and the chemical industry has lobbied governments to reduce regulations or have moved production to countries such as Thailand, where there is less regulation.\\nThe market for PFAS was estimated to be US$28 billion in 2023 and the majority are produced by 12 companies: 3M, AGC Inc., Archroma, Arkema, BASF, Bayer, Chemours, Daikin, Honeywell, Merck Group, Shandong Dongyue Chemical, and Solvay. Sales of PFAS, which cost approximately $20 per kilogram, generate a total industry profit of $4 billion per year on 16% profit margins. Due to health concerns, several companies have ended or plan to end the sale of PFAS or products that contain them; these include W. L. Gore & Associates (the maker of Gore-Tex), H&M, Patagonia, REI, and 3M. PFAS producers have paid billions of dollars to settle litigation claims, the largest being a $10.3 billion settlement paid by 3M for water contamination in 2023. Studies have shown that companies have known of the health dangers since the 1970s – DuPont and 3M were aware that PFAS was \"highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested\". External costs, including those associated with remediation of PFAS from soil and water contamination, treatment of related diseases, and monitoring of PFAS pollution, may be as high as US$17.5 trillion annually, according to ChemSec. The Nordic Council of Ministers estimated health costs to be at least €52–84 billion in the European Economic Area. In the United States, PFAS-attributable disease costs are estimated to be $6–62 billion.\\nIn January 2025, reports stated that the cost of cleaning up toxic PFAS pollution in the UK and Europe could exceed £1.6 trillion over the next 20 years, averaging £84 billion annually.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced oxidation process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced oxidation process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced oxidation process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Process", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is a toxic, colorless gas; in low concentrations, its musty odor resembles that of freshly cut hay or grass. It can be thought of chemically as the double acyl chloride analog of carbonic acid, or structurally as formaldehyde with the hydrogen atoms replaced by chlorine atoms. In 2013, about 75–80 % of global phosgene was consumed for isocyanates, 18% for polycarbonates and about 5% for other fine chemicals.\\nPhosgene is extremely poisonous and was used as a chemical weapon during World War I, where it was responsible for 85,000 deaths. It is a highly potent pulmonary irritant and quickly filled enemy trenches due to it being a heavy gas.\\nIt is classified as a Schedule 3 substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

License CC BY 4.0 wikipedia: ['In chemistry, a transition metal pincer complex is a type of  coordination complex with a pincer ligand.  Pincer ligands are chelating agents that binds tightly to three adjacent coplanar sites in a meridional configuration.  The inflexibility of the pincer-metal interaction confers high thermal stability to the resulting complexes.  This stability is in part ascribed to the constrained geometry of the pincer, which inhibits cyclometallation of the organic substituents on the donor sites at each end.  In the absence of this effect, cyclometallation is often a significant deactivation process for complexes, in particular limiting their ability to effect C-H bond activation.  The organic substituents also define a hydrophobic pocket around the reactive coordination site.  Stoichiometric and catalytic applications of pincer complexes have been studied at an accelerating pace since the mid-1970s.  Most pincer ligands contain phosphines.  Reactions of metal-pincer complexes are localized at three sites perpendicular to the plane of the pincer ligand, although in some cases one arm is hemi-labile and an additional coordination site is generated transiently.

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits, and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.\\nBecause of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.\\nSilicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs in its pure form in the Earth's crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.\\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional silicate-based soda–lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.\\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (<15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.\\nSilicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']\nA range of electrochemical carbon dioxide capture \nsystems have been reported, including those based on electrochemically driven pH swings,8 \ncapacitive systems,9,10 and systems that employ redoxactive molecules such as quinones, \nboth in protic and aprotic electrolytes.1115 Using redoxactive quinone molecules is one of the \nlargest areas of research for new technologies due to their highly reversible redoxactivity and \nstoichiometric capture of CO2 upon reduction. pubchem: ['Name: Quinone\\nText:\\nBenzoquinone appears as a yellowish-colored crystalline solid with a pungent, irritating odor.

Acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of quinone, via inhalation in humans, results in irritation of the eyes, consisting of discoloration of the conjunctiva and cornea, and causes dermatitis from dermal exposure. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to quinone in humans may result in visual disturbances, and chronic dermal contact causes skin ulceration. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of quinone in humans. The results of available animal studies are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of quinone. EPA has not evaluated quinone for carcinogenicity.\\n1,4-Benzoquinone has been reported in Blaps lethifera, Uloma tenebrionoides, and other organisms with data available.\\nQuinone is also called 1,4-benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione. Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. Derivatives of quinones are common constituents of biologically relevant molecules. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Quinone is a common constituent of biologically relevant molecules (e.g. Vitamin K1 is phylloquinone). A natural example of quinones as oxidizing agents is the spray of bombardier beetles. Hydroquinone is reacted with hydrogen peroxide to produce a fiery blast of steam, a strong deterent in the animal world.\\nQuinone is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nProperties:safety: Acute Toxic and Environmental Hazard\\nsmiles: C1=CC(=O)C=CC1=O\\nformula: C6H4O2\\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 108.09 g/mol\\nXLogP3: 0.2\\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\\nExact Mass: 108.021129366 Da\\nMonoisotopic Mass: 108.021129366 Da\\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 34.1\\nHeavy Atom Count: 8\\nFormal Charge: 0\\nComplexity: 149\\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \\n\\n']\nwikipedia: ['The quinones are a class of organic compounds that are formally \"derived from aromatic compounds [such as benzene or naphthalene] by conversion of an even number of –CH=  groups into –C(=O)– groups with any necessary rearrangement of double bonds\", resulting in \"a fully conjugated cyclic dione structure\".\\nThe archetypical member of the class is 1,4-benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione, often called simply \"quinone\" (thus the name of the class).

The lanthanide and actinide elements (the f-block) are called inner transition metals and are sometimes considered to be transition metals as well.\\nThey are lustrous metals with good electrical and thermal conductivity. Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, and have high melting and boiling temperatures. They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, as are many of their compounds. All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium).\\nEnglish chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890–1968) first used the word transition in this context in 1921, when he referred to a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example n = 3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32.

Fluorine is a naturally-occurring, pale yellow-green gas with a sharp odor. It combines with metals to make fluorides such as sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride, both white solids. Sodium fluoride dissolves easily in water, but calcium fluoride does not. Fluorine also combines with hydrogen to make hydrogen fluoride, a colorless gas. Hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine and hydrogen fluoride are used to make certain chemical compounds. Hydrofluoric acid is used for etching glass. Other fluoride compounds are used in making steel, chemicals, ceramics, lubricants, dyes, plastics, and pesticides. Fluorides are often added to drinking water supplies and to a variety of dental products, including toothpaste and mouth rinses, to prevent dental cavities. UPDATE: In 2015, thePHS replacedthe 1962 Drinking Water Standards from 0.7\"\"1.2 mg/L to an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L. This is to provide optimal concentration of fluoride in drinking water that provides the best balance of protection from dental caries while limiting the risk of dental fluorosis.\\nFluorine is a pale yellow gas with a pungent odor. It is commonly shipped as a cryogenic liquid. It is toxic by inhalation and skin absorption. Contact with skin in lower than lethal concentrations causes chemical burns. It reacts with water to form hydrofluoric acid and oxygen. It is corrosive to most common materials. It reacts with most combustible materials to the point that ignition occurs. Under prolonged exposure to fire or intense heat the containers may violently rupture and rocket.\\nDifluorine is a diatomic fluorine and a gas molecular entity. It has a role as a NMR chemical shift reference compound.\\nFluorine has been reported in Salvadora persica with data available.\\nFluorine is an element with atomic symbol F, atomic number 9, and atomic weight 19.0.\\nFluorine is a mineral with formula of F or.\\nA nonmetallic, diatomic gas that is a trace element and member of the halogen family.

It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the light noble gases. It is highly toxic.\\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.\\nOwing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.\\nFluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials 100 to 23,500 times that of carbon dioxide, and SF6 has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. Organofluorine compounds often persist in the environment due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few plants and marine sponges synthesize organofluorine poisons (most often monofluoroacetates) that help deter predation.\"]\nOur ability to selectively activate and functionalize CH bonds in organic molecules is fundamental \nto countless chemical processes.1 Despite notable advances in this field, strategies for the selective \nfunctionalization of sp2 CH bonds of alkenes are underdeveloped.29 This limitation can be traced \nback to fundamental selectivity issues that emerge on reaction of alkenes with singlesite transition \nmetal complexes. Coordination of the alkene to the metal is often kinetically accessible and non\nreversible (Figure 1). pubchem: [\"Name: Pentylene\\nText:\\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons of the type Cn-H2n, indicated by the suffix -ene.

The double bond may be internal or at the terminal position. Terminal alkenes are also known as α-olefins.\\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends using the name \"alkene\" only for acyclic hydrocarbons with just one double bond; alkadiene, alkatriene, etc., or polyene for acyclic hydrocarbons with two or more double bonds; cycloalkene, cycloalkadiene, etc. for cyclic ones; and \"olefin\" for the general class – cyclic or acyclic, with one or more double bonds.\\nAcyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups (also known as mono-enes) form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n with n being a >1 natural number (which is two hydrogens less than the corresponding alkane). When n is four or more, isomers are possible, distinguished by the position and conformation of the double bond.\\nAlkenes are generally colorless non-polar compounds, somewhat similar to alkanes but more reactive. The first few members of the series are gases or liquids at room temperature.  The simplest alkene, ethylene (C2H4) (or \"ethene\" in the IUPAC nomenclature) is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially.\\nAromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, however their structure and properties are sufficiently distinct that they are not classified as alkenes or olefins. Hydrocarbons with two overlapping double bonds (C=C=C) are called allenes—the simplest such compound is itself called allene—and those with three or more overlapping bonds (C=C=C=C, C=C=C=C=C, etc.) are called cumulenes.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Ruppert-Prakash reagent", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "TMSCF3", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Deoxofluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fluorine (F2)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cesium triflate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Selectfluor", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

The voids may contain water or some other liquids, or may be filled by gas or vacuum.  In the last case, the material is properly called silica xerogel.\\nSilica xerogel with an average pore size of 2.4 nanometers has a strong affinity for water molecules and is widely used as a desiccant.  It is hard and translucent, but considerably softer than massive silica glass or quartz, and remains hard when saturated with water.\\nSilica xerogel is usually commercialized as coarse granules or beads, a few millimeters in diameter. Some grains may contain small amounts of indicator substance that changes color when they have absorbed some water.  Small paper envelopes containing silica xerogel pellets, usually with a \"do not eat\" warning, are often included in dry food packages to absorb any humidity that might cause spoilage of the food.\\n\\'Wet\\' silica gel, as may be freshly prepared from alkali silicate solutions, may vary in consistency from a soft transparent gel, similar to gelatin or agar, to a hard solid, namely a water-logged xerogel.

It is the lightest element and, at standard conditions, is a gas of diatomic molecules with the formula H2, sometimes called dihydrogen, hydrogen gas, molecular hydrogen, or simply hydrogen. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Constituting about 75% of all normal matter, hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. Stars, including the Sun, mainly consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, hydrogen is found in water, organic compounds, as the gas H2 (dihydrogen), and in other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen (protium, 1H) consists of one proton, one electron, and no neutrons.\\nIn the early universe, the formation of hydrogen\\'s protons occurred in the first second after the Big Bang; neutral hydrogen atoms only formed about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch as the universe expanded and plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish, in 1766–81, identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance and discovered its property of producing water when burned; hence its name means \"water-former\" in Greek. Understanding the colors of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen was a crucial part of developing quantum mechanics.\\nHydrogen, typically nonmetallic except under extreme pressure, readily forms covalent bonds with most nonmetals, contributing to the formation of compounds like water and various organic substances. Its role is crucial in acid-base reactions, which mainly involve proton exchange among soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of either a negatively charged anion, where it is known as hydride, or as a positively charged cation, H+, called a proton. Although tightly bonded to water molecules, protons strongly affect the behavior of aqueous solutions, as reflected in the importance of pH.  Hydride on the other hand, is rarely observed because it tends to deprotonate solvents, yielding  H2.\\nNearly all hydrogen production is done by transforming fossil fuels, particularly steam reforming of natural gas. It can also be produced from electricity by electrolysis, however this process is more expensive. Its main industrial uses include fossil fuel processing and ammonia production. Emerging uses for hydrogen include the use of fuel cells to generate electricity.']\nLicense CC BYNC 4.0\n\n3 \npermeability of industrystandard fluorocarbon membranes such as Nafion 115, leading to \nhigh methanol crossover, and (ii) the need for a more efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction. The loss of fuel cell performance due to slow O2 reduction kinetics can be minimised to a \ncertain extent by reducing the thickness of the membrane to lower its ionic resistance, but this \nalso increases methanol crossover.

Connolly at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington Delaware (U.S. Patent 3,282,875). Additional work on the polymer family was performed in the late 1960s by Dr. Walther Grot of DuPont. Nafion is a brand of the Chemours company. It is the first of a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties that are called ionomers. Nafion\\'s unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone.  Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent chemical and mechanical stability in the harsh conditions of this application.\\nThe chemical basis of Nafion\\'s ion-conductive properties remain a focus of extensive research. Ion conductivity of Nafion increases with the level of hydration. Exposure of Nafion to a humidified environment or liquid water increases the amount of water molecules associated with each sulfonic acid group. The hydrophilic nature of the ionic groups attract water molecules, which begin to solvate the ionic groups and dissociate the protons from the -SO3H (sulfonic acid) group. The dissociated protons \"hop\" from one acid site to another through mechanisms facilitated by the water molecules and hydrogen bonding. Upon hydration, Nafion phase-separates at nanometer length scales resulting in formation of an interconnected network of hydrophilic domains which allow movement of water and cations, but the membranes do not conduct electrons and minimally conduct anions due to permselectivity (charge-based exclusion). Nafion can be manufactured with or exchanged to alternate cation forms for different applications (e.g. lithiated for Li-ion batteries) and at different equivalent weights (EWs), alternatively considered as ion-exchange capacities (IECs), to achieve a range of cationic conductivities with trade-offs to other physicochemical properties such as water uptake and swelling.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fingolimod", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fingolimod", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Fingolimod", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dimethyl fumarate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Chronic (long-term) exposure to high levels of manganese by inhalation in humans may result in central nervous system (CNS) effects. Visual reaction time, hand steadiness, and eye- hand coordination were affected in chronically-exposed workers. A syndrome named manganism may result from chronic exposure to higher levels; manganism is characterized by feelings of weakness and lethargy, tremors, a mask-like face, and psychological disturbances. Respiratory effects have also been noted in workers chronically exposed to manganese bearing particles by inhalation.\\nManganese (II) ion has been reported in Artemia salina and Allium sativum with data available.\\nManganese is an element with atomic symbol Mn, atomic number 25, and atomic weight 54.94.\\nManganese is a mineral with formula of Mn.\\nA trace element with atomic symbol Mn, atomic number 25, and atomic weight 54.94.

Fluorine is a naturally-occurring, pale yellow-green gas with a sharp odor. It combines with metals to make fluorides such as sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride, both white solids. Sodium fluoride dissolves easily in water, but calcium fluoride does not. Fluorine also combines with hydrogen to make hydrogen fluoride, a colorless gas. Hydrogen fluoride dissolves in water to form hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine and hydrogen fluoride are used to make certain chemical compounds. Hydrofluoric acid is used for etching glass. Other fluoride compounds are used in making steel, chemicals, ceramics, lubricants, dyes, plastics, and pesticides. Fluorides are often added to drinking water supplies and to a variety of dental products, including toothpaste and mouth rinses, to prevent dental cavities. UPDATE: In 2015, thePHS replacedthe 1962 Drinking Water Standards from 0.7\"\"1.2 mg/L to an optimal fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L. This is to provide optimal concentration of fluoride in drinking water that provides the best balance of protection from dental caries while limiting the risk of dental fluorosis.\\nFluorine is a pale yellow gas with a pungent odor. It is commonly shipped as a cryogenic liquid. It is toxic by inhalation and skin absorption. Contact with skin in lower than lethal concentrations causes chemical burns.

It is the lightest halogen and exists at standard conditions as pale yellow diatomic gas. Fluorine is extremely reactive as it reacts with all other elements except for the light noble gases. It is highly toxic.\\nAmong the elements, fluorine ranks 24th in cosmic abundance and 13th in crustal abundance. Fluorite, the primary mineral source of fluorine, which gave the element its name, was first described in 1529; as it was added to metal ores to lower their melting points for smelting, the Latin verb fluo meaning 'to flow' gave the mineral its name. Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist Henri Moissan isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature electrolysis, a process still employed for modern production. Industrial production of fluorine gas for uranium enrichment, its largest application, began during the Manhattan Project in World War II.\\nOwing to the expense of refining pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite, which plays a key role in aluminium refining. The carbon–fluorine bond is usually very stable. Organofluorine compounds are widely used as refrigerants, electrical insulation, and PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine contain C−F bonds. The fluoride ion from dissolved fluoride salts inhibits dental cavities and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent—meaning that its atoms are able to form up to four covalent bonds due to its valence shell exhibiting 4 electrons. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Carbon makes up about 0.025 percent of Earth\\'s crust. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of 5,700 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.\\nCarbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth\\'s crust, and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon\\'s abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth, enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life. It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.\\nThe atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various allotropes of carbon. Well-known allotropes include graphite, diamond, amorphous carbon, and fullerenes. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black, while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb \"γράφειν\" which means \"to write\"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.\\nThe most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4, while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones, dolomites and carbon dioxide, but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal, peat, oil, and methane clathrates. Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, with about two hundred million having been described and indexed; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carboxylic Acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Trichlorosilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Trichlorosilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methyltrichlorosilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Trichlorosilane", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methanesulfonic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methacrylic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "acrylic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "methanesulfonic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "tert-butyl chloride", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Acrylic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glycidol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Polystyrene sulfonic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Catalysts are not consumed by the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice; mixing, surface area, and temperature are important factors in reaction rate. Catalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form intermediates that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process of regenerating the catalyst.\\nThe rate increase occurs because the catalyst allows the reaction to occur by an alternative mechanism which may be much faster than the non-catalyzed mechanism. However the non-catalyzed mechanism does remain possible, so that the total rate (catalyzed plus non-catalyzed) can only increase in the presence of the catalyst and never decrease.\\nCatalysis may be classified as either homogeneous, whose components are dispersed in the same phase (usually gaseous or liquid) as the reactant, or heterogeneous, whose components are not in the same phase. Enzymes and other biocatalysts are often considered as a third category.\\nCatalysis is ubiquitous in chemical industry of all kinds. Estimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.\\nThe term \"catalyst\" is derived from Greek καταλύειν, kataluein, meaning \"loosen\" or \"untie\".

The lanthanide and actinide elements (the f-block) are called inner transition metals and are sometimes considered to be transition metals as well.\\nThey are lustrous metals with good electrical and thermal conductivity. Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, and have high melting and boiling temperatures. They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, as are many of their compounds. All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium).\\nEnglish chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890–1968) first used the word transition in this context in 1921, when he referred to a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example n = 3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32.

Because both electric currents and magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, magnetism is one of two aspects of electromagnetism.\\nThe most familiar effects occur in ferromagnetic materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, producing magnetic fields themselves. Demagnetizing a magnet is also possible. Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are iron, cobalt, nickel, and their alloys.\\nAll substances exhibit some type of magnetism. Magnetic materials are classified according to their bulk susceptibility. Ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, but there are actually several types of magnetism. Paramagnetic substances, such as aluminium and oxygen, are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field; diamagnetic substances, such as copper and carbon, are weakly repelled; while antiferromagnetic materials, such as chromium, have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field. The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt and can be detected only by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life, these substances are often described as non-magnetic.\\nThe strength of a magnetic field always decreases with distance from the magnetic source, though the exact mathematical relationship between strength and distance varies. Many factors can influence the magnetic field of an object including the magnetic moment of the material, the physical shape of the object, both the magnitude and direction of any electric current present within the object, and the temperature of the object.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dysprosium(III) bis(cyclopentadienyl)", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "[Dy(Cp*)2]+ cation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "[Dy(Cp*)2]+ cation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dysprosocenium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "[Dy(Cp*)2]+ or dysprosium(III) bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) cation", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cp*₂Dy", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cp*2Dy", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "(C5H5)2Dy", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "(Cp*)2Dy", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Bis(cyclopentadienyl)dysprocenium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "[(Cpttt)2Dy][B(C6F5)4]", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Dysprosium metallocene", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cp₃Dy", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dysprosium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature and at normally-encountered concentrations it is odorless. As the source of carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater.\\nIt is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 421 parts per million (ppm), or about 0.042% (as of May 2022) having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm or about 0.028%. Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of these increased CO2 concentrations, which are the primary cause of climate change.\\nIts concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological features. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a waste product. In turn, oxygen is consumed and CO2 is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration. CO2 is released from organic materials when they decay or combust, such as in forest fires. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.\\nCarbon dioxide is 53% more dense than dry air, but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere. About half of excess CO2 emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks. These sinks can become saturated and are volatile, as decay and wildfires result in the CO2 being released back into the atmosphere. CO2, or the carbon it holds, is eventually sequestered (stored for the long term) in rocks and organic deposits like coal, petroleum and natural gas.\\n\\nNearly all CO2 produced by humans goes into the atmosphere. Less than 1% of CO2 produced annually is put to commercial use, mostly in the fertilizer industry and in the oil and gas industry for enhanced oil recovery. Other commercial applications include food and beverage production, metal fabrication, cooling, fire suppression and stimulating plant growth in greenhouses.:\\u200a3\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric Chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "methanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "methanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "atmospheric chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Astrochemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric Chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methanol", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric Chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric Chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "carbon dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon Dioxide", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chemical kinetics", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Atmospheric Chemistry", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

In this regard, the use of computational methods have proven useful; \nin particular, the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is capable of providing \nconformational landscapes in atomistic detail not readily accessible via experimental approaches. For example, conformational analysis of the core pentasaccharide derived from the \nlipooligosaccharide of pathogenic bacterium Moraxella catarrhalis was recently performed \nusing molecular simulation and NMR.\nCarbohydrate biomass is an abundant renewable resource which has enormous potential for the synthesis of valuable \nchemical building blocks.1 The sugars present in this material are of particular interest as a functionalised carbon \nsource to produce chiral saturated heterocycles which are of widespread potential utility in pharmaceutical \ndevelopment.2 Whilst there are many wellestablished methods for converting sugars into chiral heterocycles such \nas tetrahydrofurans (THFs) and tetrahydropyrans (THPs), these typically rely on lengthy synthetic sequences \ninvolving the extensive use of protecting groups and high costenergy reagents (e.g. wikipedia: [\"A carbohydrate () is a biomolecule consisting of carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen atom ratio of 2:1 (as in water) and thus with the empirical formula Cm(H2O)n (where m may or may not be different from n), which does not mean the H has covalent bonds with O (for example with CH2O, H has a covalent bond with C but not with O). However, not all carbohydrates conform to this precise stoichiometric definition (e.g., uronic acids, deoxy-sugars such as fucose), nor are all chemicals that do conform to this definition automatically classified as carbohydrates (e.g., formaldehyde and acetic acid).\\nThe term is most common in biochemistry, where it is a synonym of saccharide (from Ancient Greek  σάκχαρον (sákkharon) 'sugar'), a group that includes sugars, starch, and cellulose. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower molecular weight) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars. While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix -ose, which was originally taken from the word glucose (from Ancient Greek  γλεῦκος (gleûkos) 'wine, must'), and is used for almost all sugars (e.g., fructose (fruit sugar), sucrose (cane or beet sugar), ribose, lactose (milk sugar)).\\nCarbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve as an energy store (e.g., starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g., cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods and fungi). The 5-carbon monosaccharide ribose is an important component of coenzymes (e.g., ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.\\nCarbohydrates are central to nutrition and are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide and is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal flour, such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from sugarcane or sugar beets), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in honey, many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey is often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.\\nCellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble dietary fiber. Although it is not digestible by humans, cellulose and insoluble dietary fiber generally help maintain a healthy digestive system by facilitating bowel movements. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include resistant starch and inulin, which feed some bacteria in the microbiota of the large intestine, and are metabolized by these bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids.\"]\nThis allows the application of enzymatic catalysis in new seg\nments and industrial processes, emphasizing on the synthesis of surfactants through the esterification of \nsugars. Literature records of Candida artactica lipase B point it out as a potential catalyst, leading to high \nactivity in direct esterification various polyalcohols with fatty acids 2. The esters produced have poten\ntial use as emulsifiers in the food and cosmetic industries. In addition, likely antitumor and antimicrobial \nactions are reported for this material, enabling its use in drug formulations. Traditionally, these com\npounds are produced by hightemperature reactions with toxic reagents and acid catalysts, what is not a \nclean methodology 3. Enzymatic catalysis applied in organic synthesis takes place under milder conditions of tem\nperature and pressure 4. wikipedia: ['Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.\\nLonger chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. Some other chemical substances, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste but are not classified as sugar.\\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Maltose may be produced by malting grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available ultra-processed food and beverages, and is sometimes used as a sweetener for foods (e.g., toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 pounds) of sugar each year. North and South Americans consume up to 50 kg (110 lb), and Africans consume under 20 kg (44 lb).\\nAs free sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in free sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. In 2015, the World Health Organization strongly recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake and encouraged a reduction to below 5%. In general, high sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefit and is associated with a risk of cardiometabolic and other health detriments.']\nA pioneering approach, that \nenables the direct coupling of sp2 and sp3 electrophiles, such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids, heralds \nan unprecedented disconnection in the crosselectrophile coupling domain (Figure 1A).

These compounds contain a distinctive functional group.  Analogues derived from oxygen replaced by other chalcogens belong to the ester category as well.  According to some authors, organyl derivatives of acidic hydrogen of other acids are esters as well (e.g. amides), but not according to the IUPAC.\\nGlycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters; naturally occurring lactones are mainly 5- and 6-membered ring lactones. Lactones contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables like celery and other foods.\\nEsters can be formed from oxoacids (e.g. esters of acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, xanthic acid), but also from acids that do not contain oxygen (e.g. esters of thiocyanic acid and trithiocarbonic acid). An example of an ester formation is the substitution reaction between a carboxylic acid (R−C(=O)−OH) and an alcohol (R'−OH), forming an ester (R−C(=O)−O−R'), where R stands for any group (typically hydrogen or organyl) and R′ stands for organyl group.\\nOrganyl esters of carboxylic acids typically have a pleasant smell; those of low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market. Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. Esters of phosphoric acid form the backbone of DNA molecules. Esters of nitric acid, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties.\\nThere are compounds in which an acidic hydrogen of acids mentioned in this article are not replaced by an organyl, but by some other group. According to some authors, those compounds are esters as well, especially when the first carbon atom of the organyl group replacing acidic hydrogen, is replaced by another atom from the group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb); for example, according to them, trimethylstannyl acetate (or trimethyltin acetate) CH3COOSn(CH3)3 is a trimethylstannyl ester of acetic acid, and dibutyltin dilaurate (CH3(CH2)10COO)2Sn((CH2)3CH3)2 is a dibutylstannylene ester of lauric acid, and the Phillips catalyst CrO2(OSi(OCH3)3)2 is a trimethoxysilyl ester of chromic acid (H2CrO4).\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "N-acetylglucosamine", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glyceraldehyde", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "D-glycero-D-manno-heptose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "KDO", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Glucose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Kdo", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim only to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology.\\nThe term chemotherapy now means the non-specific use of intracellular poisons to inhibit mitosis (cell division) or to induce DNA damage (so that DNA repair can augment chemotherapy). This meaning excludes the more-selective agents that block extracellular signals (signal transduction). Therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer), are now called hormonal therapies. Other inhibitions of growth-signals, such as those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases, are targeted therapy.\\nThe use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy) is systemic therapy for cancer: they are introduced into the blood stream (the system) and therefore can treat cancer anywhere in the body. Systemic therapy is often used with other, local therapy (treatments that work only where they are applied), such as radiation, surgery, and hyperthermia.\\nTraditional chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells, hence that also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called autoimmunity). These include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis and many others.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Taxanes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkaloids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Alkaloids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "alkaloids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Vinca alkaloids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Taxanes", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Flavonoids", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

More generally they are covalently bonded to macromolecules, serving as a markers (or dyes, or tags, or reporters) for affine or bioactive reagents (antibodies, peptides, nucleic acids). Fluorophores are notably used to stain tissues, cells, or materials in a variety of analytical methods, such as fluorescent imaging and spectroscopy.\\nFluorescein, via its amine-reactive isothiocyanate derivative fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), has been one of the most popular fluorophores. From antibody labeling, the applications have spread to nucleic acids thanks to carboxyfluorescein. Other historically common fluorophores are derivatives of rhodamine (TRITC), coumarin, and cyanine.

Active transporters or ion pumps are transporters that convert energy from various sources—including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), sunlight, and other redox reactions—to potential energy by pumping an ion up its concentration gradient. This potential energy could then be used by secondary transporters, including ion carriers and ion channels, to drive vital cellular processes, such as ATP synthesis.\\nThis article is focused mainly on ion transporters acting as pumps, but transporters can also function to move molecules through facilitated diffusion.

It is also known as methanal, methylene oxide, oxymethyline, methylaldehyde, and oxomethane. Formaldehyde is naturally produced in small amounts in our bodies. It is used in the production of fertilizer, paper, plywood, and urea-formaldehyde resins. It is also used as a preservative in some foods and in many products used around the house, such as antiseptics, medicines, and cosmetics.\\nFormaldehyde (gas) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\\nSolids containing varying amounts of formaldehyde, probably as paraformaldehyde (polymers of formula HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about 30). A hazard to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit spread to the environment.\\nFormaldehyde, solution, flammable appears as a colorless aqueous solution of formaldehyde, which is a gas at ordinary conditions. Has a pungent irritating odor. Flash point varies from 122 to 141 °F. Denser than water. The vapors are heavier than air and are highly irritating to the nose. Toxic if swallowed. Contact can cause severe injury to the skin accompanied by drying, cracking, and scaling. Used to make plastics, other chemicals, and fertilizers. Used as a preservative and a corrosion inhibitor.   Rate of onset: Immediate  Persistence: Hours  Odor threshold: 1 ppm  Source/use/other hazard: Disinfection/germicide; fungicide; textile; health care (tissue fixing).\\nFormaldehyde, solutions (formalin) (corrosive) appears as a colorless liquid with a pungent irritating odor. Contains 37-50% formaldehyde by mass and varying amounts of methanol, added to prevent precipitation of formaldehyde polymers (formaldehyde exists in solution as CH2(OH)2 and its polymers HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about three). Formalin free of methanol is also shipped but must be kept warm (about 30 °C (86 °F)) to prevent polymerization. Pure formaldehyde, a gas, is not handled commercially because it tends to polymerize exothermally and may ignite. Vapor from formalin solution is flammable and an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or heat. Skin and eye irritant. Confirmed carcinogen.\\nFormaldehyde is an aldehyde resulting from the formal oxidation of methanol. It has a role as a carcinogenic agent, an allergen, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a disinfectant, an environmental contaminant, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite.

Exposure to formaldehyde may occur by breathing contaminated indoor air, tobacco smoke, or ambient urban air. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to formaldehyde in humans can result in respiratory symptoms, and eye, nose, and throat irritation. Limited human studies have reported an association between formaldehyde exposure and lung and nasopharyngeal cancer.

Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

They are phytoplankton typically found in freshwater and marine systems, living in both the water column and sediment. They are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups. Depending on the species, their sizes can range from a few micrometers (μm) to a few hundred micrometers. Unlike higher plants, microalgae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces.\\nMicroalgae, capable of performing photosynthesis, are important for life on earth; they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen and use the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. \"Marine photosynthesis is dominated by microalgae, which together with cyanobacteria, are collectively called phytoplankton.\" Microalgae, together with bacteria, form the base of the food web and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them. Microalgae biomass is often measured with chlorophyll a concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production.\\nThe biodiversity of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource. It has been estimated that about 200,000-800,000 species in many different genera exist of which about 50,000 species are described. Over 15,000 novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined. Examples include carotenoids, fatty acids, enzymes, polymers, peptides, toxins and sterols. Besides providing these valuable metabolites, microalgae are regarded as a potential feedstock for biofuels and has also emerged as a promising microorganism in bioremediation.\\nAn exception to the microalgae family is the colorless Prototheca which are devoid of any chlorophyll. These achlorophic algae switch to parasitism and thus cause the disease protothecosis in human and animals.']\nOne of the most effective strategies for enhancing the stability of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) involves substituting some of their carbon atoms with main group\nelement heteroatoms, such as sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), boron (B), or phosphorus (P).6,7 Such\nheteroatom substitution not only significantly improves their stability but also endows the\nresulting polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds with a broad spectrum of properties that are\nunattainable by their purely hydrocarbon analogues. Besides finetuning the electronic\nstructure, heteroatoms can improve molecular packing, and processability, opening new\navenues for material design and application. pubchem: ['Name: Phosphorus\\nText:\\nPhosphorus, amorphous (red or violet) appears as red or dark crystals or powder.

Acute (short-term) oral exposure to high levels of white phosphorus in humans is characterized by three stages: the first stage consists of gastrointestinal effects; the second stage is symptom-free and lasts about two days; the third stage consists of a rapid decline in condition with gastrointestinal effects, plus severe effects on the kidneys, liver, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system (CNS).

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cyanobacteria", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Algae", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Carbon", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella vulgaris", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Algae", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Chlorella", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cyanobacteria", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Formaldehyde solution (formalin) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor toxic. (From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals,:\\u200a1\\u200a but felids are the only known definitive hosts in which the parasite may undergo sexual reproduction.\\nIn rodents, T. gondii alters behavior in ways that increase the rodents\\' chances of being preyed upon by felids.  Support for this \"manipulation hypothesis\" stems from studies showing that T. gondii-infected rats have a decreased aversion to cat urine while infection in mice lowers general anxiety, increases explorative behaviors and increases a loss of aversion to predators in general. Because cats are one of the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations that increase the parasite\\'s reproductive success since rodents that do not avoid cat habitations will more likely become cat prey. The primary mechanisms of T. gondii–induced behavioral changes in rodents occur through epigenetic remodeling in neurons that govern the relevant behaviors (e.g. hypomethylation of arginine vasopressin-related genes in the medial amygdala, which greatly decrease predator aversion).\\nIn humans, particularly infants and those with weakened immunity, T. gondii infection is generally asymptomatic but may lead to a serious case of toxoplasmosis. T. gondii can initially cause mild, flu-like symptoms in the first few weeks following exposure, but otherwise, healthy human adults are asymptomatic. This asymptomatic state of infection is referred to as a latent infection, and it has been associated with numerous subtle behavioral, psychiatric, and personality alterations in humans. Behavioral changes observed between infected and non-infected humans include a decreased aversion to cat urine (but with divergent trajectories by gender) and an increased risk of schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence has suggested that T. gondii infection may induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in rodents. Many of these associations have been strongly debated and newer studies have found them to be weak, concluding:\\n\\nOn the whole, there was little evidence that T. gondii was related to increased risk of psychiatric disorder, poor impulse control, personality aberrations, or neurocognitive impairment.\\nHowever, there is evidence that T. Gondii may cause suicidal ideation and suicide in humans.\\nT. gondii is one of the most common parasites in developed countries; serological studies estimate that up to 50% of the global population has been exposed to, and may be chronically infected with, T. gondii; although infection rates differ significantly from country to country.

Furthermore, these\nmethods are laborious, and suffer from a low specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility.35\nThese flaws limited the insight into which reactions are prevailing in complex foods, even\nthough lipid oxidation reaction mechanisms have been firmly established.1,6,7 This calls for\nholistic foodomics methods8,9 that enable comprehensive mapping of lipid oxidation\nproducts in a specific and quantitative fashion. wikipedia: ['In chemistry, particularly in biochemistry, a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with an aliphatic chain, which is either saturated or unsaturated.

In any of these forms, fatty acids are both important dietary sources of fuel for animals and important structural components for cells.']\nFirst reported \nin 1962,811 the Gewald reaction has been used productively since and has four distinct iterations, each \noffering unique advantages.6, 1215 These iterations include (i) the condensation of mercaptoketones or \naldehydes with activated acetonitriles, in the presence of a basic catalyst like triethylamine or piperidine \nin ethanol, N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF), dioxane or water at 50 C; (ii) a onepot multicomponent \nreaction of carbonyl compounds with activated acetonitriles and elemental sulfur in the presence of \namines such as diethylamine, morpholine, or triethylamine. wikipedia: ['In organic chemistry, an aldehyde () is an organic compound containing a functional group with the structure R−CH=O.

Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to quinone in humans may result in visual disturbances, and chronic dermal contact causes skin ulceration.

Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. Derivatives of quinones are common constituents of biologically relevant molecules. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Quinone is a common constituent of biologically relevant molecules (e.g. Vitamin K1 is phylloquinone). A natural example of quinones as oxidizing agents is the spray of bombardier beetles.

Its properties can be modified further by crosslinking or copolymerization.  All forms are nontoxic as well as chemically resilient, contributing to polyethylene's popularity as a multi-use plastic. However, polyethylene's chemical resilience also makes it a long-lived and decomposition-resistant pollutant when disposed of improperly.

It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is unreactive to most chemicals. Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian scientist of Baltic-German ancestry, discovered the element in 1844 at Kazan State University and named it in honor of Russia, using the Latin name Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production has risen from about 19 tonnes in 2009 to some 35.5 tonnes in 2017. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemical catalyst.

Fig. 1 Structure of pyrene wikipedia: ['A Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is a class of organic compounds that is composed of multiple aromatic rings. Most are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter— by engine exhaust fumes, tobacco, incinerators, in roasted meats and cereals, or when biomass burns at lower temperatures as in forest fires. The simplest representative is naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene. PAHs are uncharged, non-polar and planar. Many are colorless. Many of them are also found in fossil fuel deposits such as coal and in petroleum. Exposure to PAHs can lead to different types of cancer, to fetal development complications, and to cardiovascular issues.\\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as possible starting materials for abiotic syntheses of materials required by the earliest forms of life.']\nWe will see that Gavilan et al., 2022, in \nthe case of pyrene generated nanograins, obtained a spectrum which looks like that of biochar.

Pyrene \nAs told by Gavilan et al., 2022, PAHs are a class of aromatic organic molecules that are ubiquitous on \nEarth, in the solar system, and in the interstellar medium. PAHs are playing important roles in the \nevolution of the cosmic environments (Gavilan et al., 2022). Pyrene (C16H10), is the smallest peri\ncondensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).

It was identified as a shortfall nutrient by the 2015-2020 Advisory Committee of Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Many conditions and diseases interfere with normal body potassium balance, and underconsumption of potassium is one example. Hypokalemia (low potassium) or hyperkalemia (high potassium) may result, manifesting as various signs and symptoms. Some examples of potassium-related complications include life-threatening arrhythmia, neuromuscular dysfunction, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.  Various pharmacological preparations have been formulated to replenish potassium. They are available in an assortment of tablet, injection, and other forms, depending on the setting and condition being treated. Potassium is often a key ingredient for intravenous fluids, given to patients in clinical settings for rehydration, nutrition, and replenishment of electrolytes.

It is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to easily cut with a knife. Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals, all of which have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge (which combines with anions to form salts). In nature, potassium occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction, and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in seawater (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and occurs in many minerals such as orthoclase, a common constituent of granites and other igneous rocks.\\nPotassium is chemically very similar to sodium, the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first ionization energy, which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. It was first suggested in 1702 that they were distinct elements that combine with the same anions to make similar salts, which was demonstrated in 1807 when elemental potassium was first isolated via electrolysis. Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three isotopes, of which 40K is radioactive. Traces of 40K are found in all potassium, and it is the most common radioisotope in the human body.\\nPotassium ions are vital for the functioning of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions across nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous signs and symptoms, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, by shifting potassium from outside to inside cells and increasing potassium excretion by the kidneys.\\nMost industrial applications of potassium exploit the high solubility of its compounds in water, such as saltwater soap. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.']", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite-catalyzed reaction", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "lithium", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "zeolite catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite-catalyzed lithium ion exchange", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite-catalyzed cracking", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lithium ion exchange", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Catalytic Cracking", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Zeolite catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "shape-selective catalysis", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

(From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. In solution, it has a wide range of uses: in the manufacture of resins and textiles, as a disinfectant, and as a laboratory fixative or preservative.

Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen. Higher level of oxygen than ambient air (hyperoxia) can be introduced under normobaric or hyperbaric conditions.\\nOxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nOxygen has been reported in Euonymus hamiltonianus, Acacia kempeana, and Abelmoschus esculentus with data available.\\nOxygen is an element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight 16.\\nOXYGEN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2006 and has 82 investigational indications.\\noxygen is a mineral.\\noxygen is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nAn element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].

It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and a potent oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust, and the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\\nAt standard temperature and pressure, two oxygen atoms will bind covalently to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the chemical formula O2. Dioxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% molar fraction of the Earth\\'s atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time in Earth\\'s history. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth\\'s crust in the form of various oxides such as water, carbon dioxide, iron oxides and silicates.\\nAll eukaryotic organisms, including plants, animals, fungi, algae and most protists, need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts chemical energy by the reaction of oxygen with organic molecules derived from food and releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In aquatic animals, dissolved oxygen in water is absorbed by specialized respiratory organs called gills, through the skin or via the gut; in terrestrial animals such as tetrapods, oxygen in air is actively taken into the body via specialized organs known as lungs, where gas exchange takes place to diffuse oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out, and the body\\'s circulatory system then transports the oxygen to other tissues where cellular respiration takes place. However in insects, the most successful and biodiverse terrestrial clade, oxygen is directly conducted to the internal tissues via a deep network of airways.\\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen in Earth\\'s atmosphere is produced by biotic photosynthesis, in which photon energy in sunlight is captured by chlorophyll to split water molecules and then react with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates and oxygen is released as a byproduct. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic activities of autotrophs such as cyanobacteria, chloroplast-bearing algae and plants. A much rarer triatomic allotrope of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs the UVB and UVC wavelengths and forms a protective ozone layer at the lower stratosphere, which shields the biosphere from ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a corrosive byproduct of smog and thus an air pollutant.\\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\\nCommon industrial uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.']\nThe use of substituents remote from a reaction centre to influ\nence the stereochemical outcome of reactions is widespread in \nchemistry.17 In the case of reactions proposed to proceed via \noxacarbenium ions, this has been the subject of many studies.8\n16 The role of esters as remote substituents in stereoselective \nglycosylations has been the topic of much controversy and de\nbate, especially in relation to 4Oestermediated synthesis of \nbiologically important 1,2cisgalactosides and fucosides \n(Figure 1).1728 Flowers first proposed that longrange partici\npation, whereby the axial 4Oester of a fucosyl donor forms a \ndioxolenium ion intermediate analogous to 1 with an inaccessi\nble face, could explain the high 1,2cisselectivity observed \nin fucosylations when benzoates were placed at the 4posi\ntion.17,18 Many studies have since invoked this intermediate to \nrationalize \nstereoselective \n1,2cisgalactosylations \nand \nfucosylations.19,2123,2628 Computational studies have been used \nto support this hypothesis and, indeed, dioxolenium ions have \nbeen detected experimentally using infrared ion spectroscopy \nand cryogenic vibrational spectroscopy.22,23,29,30 However, these \nconditions are not representative of experimental conditions in \nthe solution phase. wikipedia: [\"In chemistry, an ester is a compound derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which the hydrogen atom (H) of at least one acidic hydroxyl group (−OH) of that acid is replaced by an organyl group (R′). These compounds contain a distinctive functional group.  Analogues derived from oxygen replaced by other chalcogens belong to the ester category as well.  According to some authors, organyl derivatives of acidic hydrogen of other acids are esters as well (e.g. amides), but not according to the IUPAC.\\nGlycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils. Lactones are cyclic carboxylic esters; naturally occurring lactones are mainly 5- and 6-membered ring lactones. Lactones contribute to the aroma of fruits, butter, cheese, vegetables like celery and other foods.\\nEsters can be formed from oxoacids (e.g. esters of acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, xanthic acid), but also from acids that do not contain oxygen (e.g. esters of thiocyanic acid and trithiocarbonic acid). An example of an ester formation is the substitution reaction between a carboxylic acid (R−C(=O)−OH) and an alcohol (R'−OH), forming an ester (R−C(=O)−O−R'), where R stands for any group (typically hydrogen or organyl) and R′ stands for organyl group.\\nOrganyl esters of carboxylic acids typically have a pleasant smell; those of low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market. Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester moieties. Esters of phosphoric acid form the backbone of DNA molecules. Esters of nitric acid, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive properties.\\nThere are compounds in which an acidic hydrogen of acids mentioned in this article are not replaced by an organyl, but by some other group. According to some authors, those compounds are esters as well, especially when the first carbon atom of the organyl group replacing acidic hydrogen, is replaced by another atom from the group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb); for example, according to them, trimethylstannyl acetate (or trimethyltin acetate) CH3COOSn(CH3)3 is a trimethylstannyl ester of acetic acid, and dibutyltin dilaurate (CH3(CH2)10COO)2Sn((CH2)3CH3)2 is a dibutylstannylene ester of lauric acid, and the Phillips catalyst CrO2(OSi(OCH3)3)2 is a trimethoxysilyl ester of chromic acid (H2CrO4).\"]", "number_of_hops": {}, "model_attempts": [{"file": "responses_bedrock_mistral.mistral-large-2402-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignocellulosic biomass", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignocellulosic biomass", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.deepseek.r1-v1:0-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignocellulosic biomass", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_bedrock_us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignin", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignocellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_gpt-4o_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "lignocellulosic biomass", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o1-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "cellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openai_o3-mini_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Methyl oleate", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_deepseek__deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_google__gemma-3-27b-it_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "Lignocellulose", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}, {"file": "responses_openrouter_qwen__qwq-32b-reasoning_reverified.jsonl", "answer": "lignocellulosic biomass", "number_of_hops": null, "is_correct": false}]}

Acute (short-term) oral exposure to high levels of white phosphorus in humans is characterized by three stages: the first stage consists of gastrointestinal effects; the second stage is symptom-free and lasts about two days; the third stage consists of a rapid decline in condition with gastrointestinal effects, plus severe effects on the kidneys, liver, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system (CNS). Inhalation exposure has resulted in respiratory tract irritation and coughing in humans. Chronic (long-term) exposure to white phosphorus in humans results in necrosis of the jaw, termed \"phossy jaw.\" EPA has classified white phosphorus as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.\\nPhosphorus has been reported in Artemia salina, Phytelephas aequatorialis, and Theobroma cacao with data available.\\nPhosphorus is an element with atomic symbol P, atomic number 15, and atomic weight 30.97.\\nphosphorus is a mineral.\\nPhosphorus is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nA non-metal element that has the atomic symbol P, atomic number 15, and atomic weight 31.

All elemental forms of phosphorus are highly reactive and are therefore never found in nature. They can nevertheless be prepared artificially, the two most common ones being white phosphorus and red phosphorus. With 31P as its only stable isotope, phosphorus has an occurrence in Earth\\'s crust of about 0.1%, generally as phosphate rock. A member of the pnictogen family, phosphorus readily forms a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, with as its main oxidation states +5, +3 and -3.\\nThe isolation of white phosphorus in 1669 by Hennig Brand marked the first \"discovery\" of an element not known since Antiquity. The name phosphorus is a reference to the god of the Morning star in Greek mythology, inspired by the faint glow of white phosphorus when exposed to oxygen. This property is also at the origin of the term phosphorescence, meaning glow after illumination, although white phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence, but chemiluminescence caused by its oxidation. Its high toxicity makes exposure to white phosphorus very dangerous, while its flammability and pyrophoricity can be weaponized in the form of incendiaries. Red phosphorus is less dangerous and is used in matches and fire retardants.\\nMost industrial production of phosphorus is focused on the mining and transformation of phosphate rock into phosphoric acid for phosphate-based fertilisers. Phosphorus is an essential and often limiting nutrient for plants, and while natural levels are normally maintained over time by the phosphorus cycle, it is too slow for the regeneration of soil that undergoes intensive cultivation. As a consequence, these fertilisers are vital to modern agriculture. The leading producers of phosphate ore in 2024 were China, Morocco, the United States and Russia, with two-thirds of the estimated exploitable phosphate reserves worldwide in Morocco alone. Other applications of phosphorus compounds include pesticides, food additives, and detergents.\\nPhosphorus is essential to all known forms of life, largely through organophosphates, organic compounds containing the phosphate ion PO3−4 as a functional group. These include DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids, complex compounds fundamental to the functioning of all cells. The main component of bones and teeth, bone mineral, is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, itself a phosphorus mineral.']\nThe usual BC step consists of four parts 1) \nDeposition of polysilicon on Si structure and 2) Deposition \nof Ti on polysilicon 3) Anneal to form silicide (TiSix) at the \ninterface 4) Metal deposition, which connects the contact to \nthe digit line. Prior technology nodes used a thick \nPolysilicon as the silicon material for creating the silicide \nand forming the contact 1,2. This Polysilicon occupied \nmajority of the contact structure and region. In metal bit \ncontact (MBC), the majority of the contact structure is made \nof metal (step 4), instead of traditional polysilicon (step 1) \nstructure, which helps lower the overall resistance of the \ncontact. This change from majoritypoly to majoritymetal \nis highly disruptive but is necessary to enable low resistance \ncontacts at very small dimensions. wikipedia: [\"Polycrystalline silicon, or multicrystalline silicon, also called polysilicon, poly-Si, or mc-Si, is a high purity, polycrystalline form of silicon, used as a raw material by the solar photovoltaic and electronics industry.\\nPolysilicon is produced from metallurgical grade silicon by a chemical purification process, called the Siemens process. This process involves distillation of volatile silicon compounds, and their decomposition into silicon at high temperatures. An emerging, alternative process of refinement uses a fluidized bed reactor. The photovoltaic industry also produces upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si), using metallurgical instead of chemical purification processes.  When produced for the electronics industry, polysilicon contains impurity levels of less than one part per billion (ppb), while polycrystalline solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) is generally less pure. \\nIn the 2010's, production shifted toward China, with China-based companies accounting for seven of the top ten producers and around 90% of total worldwide production capacity of approximately 1,400,000 MT. German, US and South Korea companies account for the remainder. \\nThe polysilicon feedstock – large rods, usually broken into chunks of specific sizes and packaged in clean rooms before shipment – is directly cast into multicrystalline ingots or submitted to a recrystallization process to grow single crystal boules. The boules are then sliced into thin silicon wafers and used for the production of solar cells, integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices.\\nPolysilicon consists of small crystals, also known as crystallites, giving the material its typical metal flake effect. While polysilicon and multisilicon are often used as synonyms, multicrystalline usually refers to crystals larger than one millimetre. Multicrystalline solar cells are the most common type of solar cells in the fast-growing PV market and consume most of the worldwide produced polysilicon. About 5 tons of polysilicon is required to manufacture one 1 megawatt (MW) of conventional solar modules.

Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called brimstone, which means \"burning stone\". Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.\\nSulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life. Many cofactors also contain sulfur, including glutathione, and iron–sulfur proteins.
